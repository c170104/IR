[{"Movie":"Fox and the Hound","Title":"The Fox's Apology","Author":"Quazie89","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12866314","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello, everybody! I wrote this story because The Fox and the Hound is one of my favorite movies, and I just thought that Tod apologizing to Chief for hurting him on the train tracks would've been something he would've done, despite everything, so that's another reason why I wrote this one. Tod just seems like that kind of character to me, anyway! Chief was also one of my favorite characters in the movie when I was younger (I was a wierd kid, lol), and he still is, so I just thought it would be kind of nice to see them patch things up a little bit. This story's a little short, another drabble, really, but I hope you enjoy it! It was early dawn, the dew still wet on the leaves littered across the forest floor and the sun just coming up over the hills when the fox crept out of the woods, heading toward the hunter's house lurking in the distance. Now, you might be wondering why a fox would be going to a hunter's house, of all places, since foxes tend to avoid hunters at all possible costs, but the fox did have a good reason for visiting the hunter's house, or thought he did, anyway, and he believed it to be a very good reason, maybe a little dangerous one, but he was bound and determined in his mission to see it through no matter what. He treaded carefully, the soft pads of his paws scarcely making a sound, crouching low when he got closer and closer to the house. Approaching the fence surrounding the ominous dwelling, he slinked under the barricade, wriggling his lithe body under it until he slithered his way on the other side, very much the same way he had done when he had been a cub. When he rose back up, he caught sight of the two dog houses in the yard, his hackles starting to rise, but he continued onward, ever like the brave solider he was. Once he was standing before the doghouses, a couple of barrels in the middle of the yard, he made the even braver decision to make a more thorough inspection of one of them in particular. Taking a closer look at the doghouse in question, he peered inside, realizing the dog itself was asleep, snoring quietly. He wasn't too concerned about the dog, however, knowing it was an old dog, it's already natural grey fur turning greyer from age, and that it's bark was much worse than it's bite nowadays, his hunting days being now long gone, mostly due to the constant limp he now walked with, which the fox had been the cause of and part of the reason why he was even there to begin with in the first place. He looked over at the other dog house, saw that the much younger dog resting in it was also asleep, and resisted the urge to wake it up, for this dog was a good, old friend and he didn't want to disturb him from his sleep. Turning back to the other dog house, the fox cleared his throat, sat back on his haunches, and gulped. \"C-Chief, it's me, Tod,\" he said, stammering for words. \"I just wanted to apologize for getting you hurt on the traintracks.\" With a pained grunt, the old dog snapped awake at the sound of Tod's voice, his lips curling into a snarl when he blinked the blurriness out of his weary, groggy gaze and was able to make out the shape of the fox sitting right in front of him, his head shooting up off of his paws. \"What are you doing here, Fox?\" he asked, his mouth opening in a yawn, and his lolling tongue hung over his bottom lip, drool forming around his jaws. \"I thought my master killed ya off.\" Tod shook his head. \"No, he let me go, seeing how much I meant to Copper and everything,\" he said, his entire body trembling. \"Bah!\" Chief exclaimed in disgust, resting his head back on his paws. \"I don't believe that for a sec.'\" He glanced out of the corner of his eye, his gaze drifting to the house. \"You better get out of here before the Master catches ye again.\" He turned back to Tod, his mouth curling up into a wide, leering, malevolent grin, revealing every one of his dull, but still long and imposing teeth. \"If he did let you go, which I highly doubt, I don't think he'll let you live a second time, especially if he catches you back on his property.\" Tod sighed. \"I know, I know,\" he said, hanging his head down in shame. \"Look, I just came to apologize-\" \"For what?\" Chief asked, growing more and more irritated by the fox's presence by the minute. \"For getting you hurt on the train tracks,\" Tod said, seeing it was painfully obvious the old dog hadn't heard him the first time. \"I didn't mean for it to turn out that way. I was just trying to survive.\" \"Yeah, yeah, I know,\" Chief said, and Tod was shocked when he gave him another smile, only a friendly smile this time, and not one that made him feel like he was going to eat him. \"I don't blame you, kid. I would've done the same thing.\" \"Hey, Chief, I brought you breakfast, boy!\" The fox and the hound both had different reactions to this sudden announcement. Tod jumped up at the sound of the voice, Chief raised his head back up again, causing Tod to roll his eyes when he heard the thumping of his tail wagging against the hard, wooden floor of the barrel. Some things would never change, no matter what, and Chief was one of them. \"You better get outta here, kid,\" Chief said, turning back to Tod. \"That's the Master callin,' and he's gonna' catch you sure as the world if you don't hurry it up out of here real quick.\" Chief didn't have to tell Tod this twice. \"Right,\" Tod said, and seeing the lean and lanky figure of Amos Slade limping toward them, waving a piece of meat in the air and holding a gun in his hand, bolted from the house, never looking back once.

Just then a Nurse walked in holding a blanket. a pink blanket. Cash Shakily walked over and gently picked up the little girl as if she was the most fragile thing in the world. He just stood there and gazed at the sleeping baby girl. She had brown hair like his own, and just slept peacefully snuggled next to him. The nurse came out a while ago and said he could come back. He shook his head and followed her back while holding the girl as if she was china. \"Right in here Sir.\" The Nurse said and Cash smiled and nodded. He sucked in a breath and knocked on the door an peeked in at the tired woman. \"Hey.\" \"Hey, come 'ere Hun.\" Dixie said as Cash slowly crossed the room holding the little girl. \"Look at our little boy!\" She happily whispered holding an auburn haired little boy. \"Yeah, you did great darlin' Look at our li'l girl.\" He whispered holding her gently. \"Well, what do ya think Cash, what are we gonna call 'em?\" Dixie asked. \"Well what'd you wanna call him?\" Cash asked looking at the little boy who in turn made gurgling noises as did his older sister. \"Austin.

Swift nodded and took off his uniform off. He wandered the school in deep thought then he bumped into something, or someone . \"H-hey?!\" Chennai said but turned crimson when she saw him . \"Uh-uh...\" Swift was at a lose for words before rubbing his neck and sticking a out and saying. \"My name's Swift. Fox ummmm what you're name uh miss?\" \"M-my name is Chennai. Hound Swift.\" Chennai shook his hand and smiled. \"Wait Hound?

Before he could say anything she chuckled and twirled around and walked to the truck taking out a pair of keys with a little microphone key chain. It went like this for the next few years until he proposed to her. They sat on the couch two months after they got married, his hand resting on her abdomen. \"What do you want it to be Hun?\" Chennai asked as Swift massaged her stomach. \"I want to have a little girl just like you Nai.\" And they did. \"Mr. Fox?\" The nurse asked and Swift shot up and briskly followed the nurse to Chennai's room. \"Hey baby.\" He said peeking into the room. She gave a tired smile and held up the baby in her arms, which was wrapped in a light red blanket. \"Come meet your little girl Swift.\" Chennai beamed. Girl! Swift sat near her as she passed him the tiny baby. \"Are you alright Darlin?\" Chennai asked as Swift held the little girl with tears in his eyes. \"Y-Yeah I-I'm ok it's just...

Enjoy! Twig felt the night breeze rustle through his fur. Only a small cub the cold wasn't strong enough to bear. His other five brothers and sisters were snug in their mother's tail. He agreed he couldn't sleep with it often than he could because he was the oldest and the small pups needed extra attention. He walked up to his dad Tod sleeping just outside the den so to guard the entrance. He must dosed off while doing so. Twig wanted so much to sleep agains the warmth of his father but had feeling his dad would probably laugh at him since he was the oldest of the cubs. \"Padding of feet I hear?\" whispered his dad. \"No,\" denied Twig. \"Why do I hear voices then?\" chuckled his father as he turned to him. \"I can't sleep, Papa,\" said Twig. \"It's too cold.\" \"It is rather chilly isn't it,\" agreed Tod but smiled. \"Do you want to sleep under my tail tonight?\" \"But - isn't it only for babies?\" asked Twig. \"Not if you're still a cub,\" said Tod. Twig's smiled lit up at at once and padded over his his father. Tod lifted his tail up as Twig snuggled strongly into his father's flank and his tail covering him. His mother's tail was so soft and smooth but his father's tail was - was Heaven. String and busy, his father squeezed him in tightly. \"Comfortable, champ?\" \"This is the best tail I ever felt,\" Twig commented. \"Glad it is,\" chucked Tod. Tod never felt the warmth of a tail as a cub since he had no mother. He only ever felt the warmth of his basket that his owner Widow Tweed gave him. But ever since she moved him into the wilderness, it was hard to find comfort out in the wild. He was offered shelter from a friendly porcupine who sept in his tail and it felt nice how someone was using it, it was like pride of keeping someone warm. Then there were the times he slept with the beautiful Vixey which rarely happened now since he had to stand guard to protect her and his three beautiful pups, especially Twig. It was a lovely tickling sensation he was giving Tod nuzzling into his side to make himself comfortable and clinging to his huge, bushy tail like a blanket. \"Papa?\" asked Twig. \"Am I too old for tail warmth even thought I'm the oldest?\" \"Of course not, sweetheart,\" smiled Tod as he licked his son. \"As long as you are my baby, you are ever too old to do anything with me.\" Twig licked Tod's cheek making giggle. \"When can I go hunting with you, Papa?\" \"When you're older.\" Twig frowned in disappointment. \"But don't grow up too fast, son,\" said Tod nuzzling him. \"Enjoy the young age you rightfully deserve. It gives Mama and me great please to watch your six grow that way. Besides, we still play don't we. You always chased my tail as a baby.\" Twig smirked and clinged onto it. \"Now I have good reason for chasing it.\" He would want to go back to his mother but he had found a tail better than her's. \"Good night, son,\" said Tod as he kissed his son's head. \"Good night, Papa,\" Twig yawned as he slowly closed his eyes on account of the comfortable treating of his father drifting him back and forth and the warmth of his warm, fluffy tail. When he grew up, he wanted a tail just like that.

This is what I thought would have happened if the movie's ending had not been so sweet. Please follow/favorite and reviews are always welcome.) Anger is a punishment we give ourselves for someone else's mistake. Author unknown The sound of howling drew closer as Copper shrunk the gap between him and a friend he had done wrong. The painful images of his broken body remained etched in his memory, the thought of how it had happened as fresh as the spring tide flowing down the waterfall which a young soul had just plunged. Copper's adopted father had been hit by a train, causing the tan Bloodhound to swear revenge. However, now that the revenge had been committed, his mind had become overthrown with guilt. He was the only one who could ask for forgiveness. Once he had reached the bottom of the cliff, the sight of Tod's lifeless body was resting in the shallow banks of the pool. His once beautiful orange and white fur was tattered and tarnished, with a large crimson soaked area serving as a tale, showing the severity of his injury to the forest around them. His once bushy tail now seemed nothing more than a thin rope of red. \"Tod, you,\" was all Copper could manage to say before being startled by an own landing above him. Big Mama had been watching over the young fox for the last few days. \"Hey! Haven't you done enough damage already? Are you here to finish what you started?!\" Big Mama asked as she fixed her eyes on the hound below her. She had seen almost everything that had unfolded, yet she remained skeptical. She had seen the two sneak off into the wood to play with one another during their adolescents, giving little to no regard for each other's role in the world. \"I'm truly sorry, I mean him no harm,\" the Bloodhound said. His once smooth voice had become riddled with unwelcoming irritation by the sleepless nights spent sobbing and whimpering, unable to free himself as a wave of guilt washed over him, flooding his body and leaving nothing but misery in its wake. Tod started to awaken. The deep yet strained voice brought him to open his eyes and find its source. \"How could you possibly harm him anymore? You have already signed his death warrant.\" Big Mama's blunt remark was the one thing Copper was dreading the most. \"Please, all I ask is to be forgiven,\" Copper said as his bloodshot eyes began to fill with tears. This was the final straw. Just as Big Mama was about to finish off and chase him away, a soft, hoarse voice called out. The voice was barely recognized, yet it had become the most important. \"Copper,\" Tod called out. His eyes remained open long enough for him to realize that his friend was right in front of him. He had to do this, even if it was his last words. \"I forgive you,\" the fox said as he took his final breath and shut his eyes for the final time. ","Summary":" (Author's note: Hi everybody.

Upon hearing this, Copper began to cheer up and his owner opened the door. \"Have fun, Copper!\" Chief called. \"I will!\" Copper shouted back, \"And see you when I get back!\" … The little hound puppy was prancing about in the puddles, making an immense number of splashes until he entered Tod's property. Upon hearing those splashes, the small red fox slithered out through a pet door. \"Hey, Copper, ready to play?\" he asked. \"Yeah, let's!\" Copper exclaimed vibrantly, hopping onto the puddles. Tod shook himself off of Copper's splashes, giggling. \"Well, what're we waiting for? Let's play!\" With that, he splashed onto puddles, following Copper in the rain. Not only were they interested in puddles, they came to a liking on rain. Rain made them want to hightail up and down to and fro. On that occasion, three birds: Big Mama, the owl, Dinky, the sparrow, and Boomer, the woodpecker watched the two happily play out in the rain. \"Oh, I wish I could play out in the rain, too,\" Dinky lamented, \"But I might get hit by a single drop, causing me to fall.\" \"What if I'm there with you, Dinky?\" Boomer ventured to ask, \"Besides, you're not that small.\" \"Alright Boomer. It's worth a try,\" Dinky finally said and the two soared in the rain. \"Good luck, boys!\" Big Mama shouted after them and went to sleep in her hollow tree. For good measure, Boomer was right. Dinky wasn't very light as the sparrow anticipated and he was thankful for Boomer's word. While Tod and Copper were out enjoying themselves, the birds greeted them. \"Dinky! Boomer! What are you doing out here?\" Tod inquired. \"Not much, really, kid,\" Dinky replied. \"We just came out here to enjoy the nice weather,\" seconded Boomer. \"Who is this hound dog?\" Dinky asked Tod. \"My friend, Copper,\" Tod answered. Shortly, Boomer swooped down and gripped Copper by the collar, but to his surprise, the hound pup was a little too heavy for him to lift. So, the woodpecker gently set him back on the ground. \"I wouldn't be staying out in the rain for far too long, kids,\" Dinky warned, \"Because you could get pneumonia.\" \"Pneumonia?\" Copper and Tod asked in unison. \"Yes, it's a fever, but worse. You can get sick or even catch a cold.\" Hearing this, Tod and Copper were terribly scared by his forewarning. \"So, you should get inside now, before you catch a cold,\" Dinky advised. \"Thank you, Dinky!\" Tod said. \"We'll see you when we see you!\" Copper called. \"Anytime kids!\" Dinky yelled. \"Bye Tod,\" Copper said. \"See you later, Copper,\" said Tod. Copper converged to his home, while Tod did the same. Fortunately, neither one of them got sick. … That night, Copper invited Tod to his home. The hound had the fox hide from Chief's and Amos's sight. Soon after that was taken care of, Copper sat on the couch for a few minutes enjoying his spare time. \"Copper! Pizza!\" Amos cried, later getting his pup's attention. Quickly, Copper descended toward the kitchen. His owner gave Chief and Copper a slice of pizza. Copper secretly grabbed a slice and brought it to the fox. Tod took a bite of it and found it delicious. \"Mmm, this is some pretty good pizza,\" Tod said, not quite as loud.\" \"Yeah, it is pretty good stuff,\" Copper agreed. \"I couldn't agree more.\" The End Author's notes: I visualized the pizza scene when I was very little.

Everything in the Game Preserve went smoothly and thanks to a gigantic ruler of the forest: A bear with black fur, grey hair, and red eyes. Everyone respected him, no matter how massive his length was–size didn't make a difference. Neither does the color of his fur, let alone his eyes. No animal or man judged him. \"Because I am the ruler of these sacred woods,\" the bear announced firmly, but even, \"It's not to say that you can't go anywhere you wanted, but just remember…Do not interact with humans because they are dangerous creatures.\" His voice may be gruff, but they took his word for it. After all, he is king of the Game Preserve. Or is he? … Later on, in life, the \"so-called leader\" had become greedy and obsessive when he emerged a hound dog's hunter, who trespassed in his territory and wanted to eat him in order for him to gain power for himself. Well, shouldn't he eat those who disagree with him or turn against him? If anything, that bear could eat berries or even fish. Besides, bears like fish and berries! \"NO!\" a male fox's voice bellowed, \"LET HIM GO!\" It was Tod's. \"What did you say?\" the beastly bear demanded. \"You will not eat this human being!\" Dinky, the sparrow yelled defiantly. \"He could be one of us!\" Boomer, the woodpecker protested, gesturing towards a human being. \"What if he wants to support us?\" Big Mama suggested. \"You're the most judgmental leader we've ever had!\" a porcupine remarked, pointing his finger at the demonic creature. \"If you eat my master,\" a hound said. His name was Copper. \"Then, you'll have to eat me, too!\" \"We will banish you for treason!\" Vixey threatened the bear. He was terribly furious by Vixey's intimate threat! All this time, he pretended to be a good dictator, but was now viewed as a phony, ugly beast, who was signified as a danger to all man-kind. In other words, the animal kingdom. The barbaric bear was officially exiled for good.

One-shot! Pre-movie! Each day, a young fox named Tod and a hound pup named Copper played in the woods. That was until a bear cub their age stopped by without their alertness. \"Hi!\" he called to get their attention. \"Hello,\" Copper said. \"Hi,\" said Tod. \"Do you want to be my friend?\" the bear cub asked them. The duo looked at each other in the eye intently until they finally replied simultaneously, \"Sure.\" \"Okay,\" said the bear cub. \"I can invite you over,\" Copper said. \"That'd be great,\" the bear said. \"I'll invite you over, too, Tod,\" Copper said, looking at Tod. \"Thanks, Copper, you're a true friend,\" Tod beamed. … That night as promised, Copper led Tod and the bear cub inside without being detected by Chief and the hunter named Amos Slade. Everything went well at that time. The bear curiously took a gander at the living room and boy was he engrossed! Even Tod was amazed, marveling over everything in Amos' house and best of all, no one got caught for Amos and Chief were already in bed. \"Hey, guys!\" the young bear called, peering out the window. Tod and Copper went over by him to see what was up with that bear. \"What is this?\" he asked gesturing towards the window. \"That's a window,\" Copper replied. \"Okay because I can see the stars and the world from up here.\" The fox and the hound climbed up the windowsill to watch the world from above. Wanting to see more of the house, the cub plopped down to the floor and found a tug-o-war toy. \"Wanna play?\" the bear cub asked. \"Yeah,\" Copper replied, \"But let's not wake Chief and my owner.\" \"Who's Chief?\" \"My adopted father.\" \"Oh,\" the bear cub said thoughtfully. They played tug-o-war as quietly as they could. Unfortunately for the bear cub, he lost and he hated to lose. So, he heaved himself up to avenge himself against the winner. It was then Copper realized that the bear cub had been a horrible friend at the end and just when the bear cub was about to strike him, Copper bounced up on him and bit him in self-defense. Tod saw all that was happening and recognized how bad the bear cub was, so he, too, jumped up on the bear cub in order to protect his friend with all the courage that he can muster from mayhem. \"Look guys, I'm sorry,\" the bear cub lied, feigning shock and innocence. \"Get out!\" Copper growled. \"Yeah, out, traitor!\" seconded Tod, \"That was your fair warning.\" Without another word, the traitorous bear cub went home. \"Thanks, Tod, for saving me,\" Copper said. \"Hey, anytime you need me, I'll always be around to protect you,\" Tod replied and his promise was kept. The End Author's note: Sort of similar to my previous Fox and the Hound one-shot, A Beastly King of the Forest , but with the bear being a cub in this story, who stirred up trouble. It's funny how a creature like him hated to lose. *I'm also alluding to the scene in the movie when the bear was about to finish Copper off, it looked to me like he smiled just doing it because he likes seeing his victims get hurt. That was until Tod came straight to Copper's aid. *The moral of the story is, do not be friends with those who were mean to you before.

Tod recognized the stranger. \"Jenny? Is that you?\" he said. \"Yes it's me silly.\" She said. Suddenly, jumped on Tod. \"Jenny what are you doing?\" he said. \"Come on I just want to have some fun\" She said. Suddenly Vixey walked in and saw Jenny on top of Tod. Tod pushes Jenny off of him and says \"Vixey I can ex-.\" He was cut off short by Vixey. \"Save it… I saw what happened.\" She said. \"It isn't what it looks like\" he said.

Let me take you back a few years, 10 to be exact. A young 13-year-old Dixie Virginia West sat on the street as the rain poured down making her black tank-top stick to her skin and her faded and torn jeans to cling to her legs. She let the sob she had been holding back out as she broke down and cried right there in the street of the town of Spencer, Tennessee. She had just watched her father kill her mother and then himself in a drunken rage. The poor girl was so emotionally and physically drained that she fell asleep in the dirt street. \"LYLE STOP!\" Granny Rose yelled as the man stepped hard on the brakes sending a sleeping Cash flying from his bed in the back of the old bus. \"What's going on Granny?\" Cash mumbled rubbing the sleep from his eyes. But the 65-year old woman was already out of the bus with Lyle looking a muddy, shivering, wet Dixie over. \"Cash help Lyle get her into the bus...\" \"WAIT!\" A girl just a bit older than Dixie yelled running out of a house nearby. \"Let me come with you... I... I'm a friend of hers... Zelda...\" She gasped out of breathe. Cash grumbled but Lyle nodded and Granny Rose said, \"Well get in here Zelda.\" \"Thanks...\" Zelda said going to sit, but Granny Rose told her to go to the back of the bus and change out of her wet clothes. Because it had rained almost all night and Dixie didn't have a coat, she got soaked to the bone in cold rain. \"Hey uh, is she ok Granny?\" Cash asked peeking into the bed room on the bus. Zelda had fell asleep on the couch after she changed her clothes and then drove for half of the day across Tennessee then stopped at a rest stop so Lyle could rest. \"Well she's sleeping calmly now instead of tossing and turning, the only problem is that she has a fever...\" Granny rose said sadly. Dixie's subconscious, or what she's dreaming, or remembering: \"Dixie go to your room.\" Alison told her daughter worriedly. \"B-but ma?!\" Dixie protested but got a astern glare from her mother. She ran up stairs and took out her guitar which her best friend, even though she was 5 years older than her, Zelda bought her for her birthday. Dixie had taught herself how to play. She was so in-tuned to playing the guitar she didn't hear the door slam or the heavy steps up to her room, not until her father snatched her guitar right from her hands. \"What? HEY! GIVE THAT BACK!\" She yelled trying to grab her guitar back from the burly man she called father. \"IT'S MINE!\" \"HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU GET ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY THIS?!\" He bellowed turning the fine wood interment in his hands. \"It was a gift! NOW GIVE IT BACK!\" She yelled but her father just trumped down the stairs, guitar in hand. Dixie followed close behind but before she could snatch her guitar back he tossed it into the fire place. \"NOOOOOO!\" She yelled but it was too late she could hear the wood crackle and the strings pop. \"Why did you do that Darrel?\" Alison asked mortified, she knew Dixie loved that guitar, and now it was ash and smoke. \"Why do you care b***?!\" He asked as he took a gulp from the beer bottle in hand. Both women backed off. A few hours had passed and Darrel had drunken a whole case of beer. Dixie sulked down the stairs, for her it felt as if life had very little meaning without her guitar. \"-Wait Darrel please! No-No-NONONONONONONO!\"- BANG! Dixie watched in horror as her father shot her mother, beer bottle in hand, 22. in the other. Then he brought the gun up to his face and pulled the trigger. Dixie walked down stairs shakily, seeing blood leak from her parents. \"I'm glad.\" She muttered bitterly. Was it bad she was happy? Considering the circumstances, no, no it was not bad that she was happy. She ran out of the house as the rain began to pour. Dixie shot up in the bed and looked around at her unfamiliar surroundings. \"Wha...\" \"Your fever's gone down!\" Cash exclaimed happily. \"AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!\" Dixie screamed and was then bounced off of the bed as they drove through a pothole. \"Oooff!\" \"Calm down we ain't gonna hurt you. You've had a fever for three days straight.\" Cash said. \"Where are my clothes?!\" Dixie said realizing that she no longer had her tank-top. \"It's one of Granny Rose's shirts uh Ms...?\" Cash asked waving his hand. \"Dixie West. Ummmmmmmm?\" \"Cash Hound. Ms. West. Ya hungry?\" Cash said shaking her hand. \"VERY!\" Dixie snatched up the ham sandwich offered. \"Uh I'd slow down if I was you Ms. West!\" Cash said but she was already done. \"So, where are we Cash?\" Dixie asked brushing crumbs from her shirt. \"Manchester, Ms. West.\" Cash said leaning back in his chair and propping his legs up on the bottom of the night-stand near Dixie. \"My name is 'Dixie'. 'Di-Xie'.\" She spoke slowly. \"Not 'Ms. West'... Just Dixie! Mr. Hound .\" Dixie rolled his last name on her tongue sending shivers down his spine. \"Ok, you have a point Ms.- Er Dixie...\" Cash mumbled as his cheeks started heating up. Dixie let out a chuckle and yawned. \"Wake me in an hour or whenever we stop again.\" Dixie said getting comfortable. The following summer, when they were 14. They were going to the county fair in Trenton. \"C'mon Dixie!\" Cash yelled running off into the midst of the fair with Dixie trailing him greatly. \"C-Cash! Hold... Up...!\" Dixie yelled running after the cowboy. \"CASH!\" Waylon yelled and Floyd finished his thought. \"WAIT!\" \"UP!\" They both yelled. They were only 10 and Cash's legs were much longer than their own. \"C-Cash did you forget what 'wait up!' means?!\" Dixie snapped at him out of breath. \"No.\" He said turning around from the food stand. \"Why you, selfish son of a-\" Dixie thought that he had gotten food for himself, but instead his arms were filled with snacks and drinks. \"Well ain't you gonna help me Dix, or do I have to carry all of this stuff back to the bus on my own?\" Cash asked her. Dixie's mouth opened and closed like a fish's but no words came out as she took part of his load and walked back to the bus. \"That damn... why do I even try with him... He is kind of... OH, NO DIXIE! Snap out of it, he's just a friend... Bad girl nuh-uh think about anything else just not... those... beautiful chocolate brown eyes... and dashing smile... and perfect body... No! No! NONO STOP THINKING ABOUT HIM!\" Dixie thought as they entered the bus carrying food. It was no secret that they'd stole a glance at each other's 'good qualities' a time or two... or twenty. Zelda would tease the two teens every once and a while just to get the two blushing, and then she would roar with laughter. \"Well, well, well the two love birds are back Rose!\" Zelda yelled from the couch of the bus. \"Get off Zelda!\" Dixie said after she placed the burgers and hot dogs on the little table. \"Ok, ok sheesh!\" Zelda said putting her hands up. Dixie took a large bite out of a peanut butter cookie and sat down heavily. \"Why eat it Dix? May as well slap-\" \"I dare you to finish that thought Zelda! I just dare you!\" Dixie growled and Zelda quickly shut her mouth. That night Cash led Dixie through the fair grounds, towards the Ferris wheel. \"C-C-C-Cash tell me that ain't the Ferris wheel?!\" Dixie choked out. \"You know how I feel about 'em!\" \"Relax Dix, you're with me!\" Cash said confidently leading her through the throngs of people. There were 3 things that scared her: 1: Ferris wheels. They were too high for her liking. 2: Fireworks. They were too noisy and well they were too close. 3: Thunder storms. I know, silly but they would mortify her, Cash, Waylon, Floyd, Granny Rose, and Zelda. While she was listing all the things she was scared of she had been on auto pilot, meaning wherever Cash took her she would be going, and that ended up being the Ferris wheel. They were half way up when she realized where she was. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\" She let loose a blood curdling scream. Cash grabbed her arms and turned her towards him lightly pressing their lips together touching right as the fireworks went off! When they parted the Wheel was at its highest peek. \"Why'd... we... you... uh...\" Dixie was at a loss for words. Did Cash like her? Like that? \"Woah nelly did he just...? did WE just...? WE DID! HE kissed ME!? So, does that mean he likes me? Like I like him? Oh boy... So then he likes me and I like him... so that means... OH MY GOODNESS!\" Dixie thought then fainted onto Cash's shoulder. \"Hmm-hmm, she looks so cute when she's sleeping, or at least passed out. I wonder why she didn't return the kiss...? Oh well, I guess I caught her off guard... I hope she's not mad at me for this... I wonder if she likes me like I love her? Oh well, I'm just gonna enjoy this moment with her...\" Cash thought happily. When the ride ended Dixie had come to. \"So...?\" Cash drawled. \"So...\" Dixie drawled. \"Ummmm I-I-I... I'm sorry Dixie... I... I should'a thought more be-\" Cash began but Dixie cut him off. \"Hush. I... I liked it.\" She said her cheeks aglow crimson. \"I'm... Wait you did?!\" Cash asked happily stopping and grabbing her shoulders. She nodded before grabbing his shirt and planting a kiss on his lips. Cash's eyes went wide before he melted into the kiss. \"WOO! YEAH! GO! WOOOHOOO!\" Zelda yelled while clapping loudly. Dixie and Cash slowly parted and Dixie glared daggers at Zelda who instantly shut up and walked quickly to the bus. \"I... I love you Cash.\" Dixie said looking down in hopes to hide her red cheeks. But it was unnecessary since Cash sported his own bright red brush. \"I love you too Dixie.\" He said, they walked back to the bus hand in hand. Fanfic Girl of all worlds- Ok this is the end of Chapter one of Meeting You. I hope you enjoy! I want to give the stage to my Partner in writing this Fanfiction! And now SydThaKyd1998! SydThaKyd1998- Hey everyone! Thanks for reading the start of an amazing story, and we both hope y'all continue reading till the end. Please Review! THANK YOU![Chapter 2] Two years after Dixie and Cash admitted their feelings for each other, and one year after they started the 'Singin Strays' They were at a county fair preforming at in Woodbury. They had practiced most of the day and some how both 12-year-olds, Waylon and Floyd, managed to stay awake and not complain. Dixie on the other hand was having trouble staying awake. \" We're in haaaaaaaaaaaaa -aaaaaaaahhhhhhh-ah-umm...\" Dixie let out a yawn during the song and stretched. \"Dixie Wha-what was that?!\" Cash asked his girlfriend who had yawned 15 times in the past few minutes. \"Cash, hun, it's gettin late can we stop or at least take a break?\" Dixie asked letting out another yawn. \"No! No we cannot Dixie! There's a talent scout coming tomorrow and I want to sound perfect!\" Cash snapped at her. \"We've been up since the crack of dawn Cash! DAWN ! It's a miracle Waylon and Floyd are still standin! An what about Granny!? Consider her a bit! She's 68 fer heavens sakes! And I know for one I'm getting tired and I know you must-\" \"Well I ain't! Now can we please get back to rehearsal?!\" Cash yelled making them flinch. \"Hmph! You know you used to be a lot more fun to be around! I'm headin to bed, anyone who's tired c'mon.\" Dixie said as she grabbed her coat to make her way to the bus. Waylon and Floyd took off out of the barn, even Granny Rose was making her way out. \"You all get back here!\" Cash yelled. Dixie frowned and looked at Cash sadly. \"C'mon to bed please hun?\" \"No! If you all won't practice I've gotta pick up the slack!\" He snapped at her. She sighed and began to walk out of the barn only to be stopped by Cash grabbing her wrist. \"Let go Cash.\" She said not turning around to face him. He tugged on her wrist and said, \"You ain't goin no where Dix. Yer gonna stay here and practice.\" \"Cash let go of me!\" She said a bit louder but he just tugged harder. \"No!\" \"I SAID LET GO!\" She spun on heel her free hand swinging up and hitting him across the face. Hard. He still held her wrist an brought his hand up to rub the spot where she had slapped him. \"I... Cash... I'm sorry!\" Dixie said but Cash let go of her wrist and walked to the back of the barn. \"Go.\" He said angrily. \"Wha?\" Dixie asked worried that he was mad. \"Go. You wanted to so do it then. Go... GET OUT!\" Cash yelled at her angrily. Making her cower back with tears in her eyes. \"Fine.\" She said running out of the barn letting a few tears fall. The next morning when she woke up Dixie looked across from where she slept to where Cash usually slept. But the bed was untouched like it had been for the past few nights. She sighed and walked out of the bus sadly. True she and Cash fought, but they never hurt one another. Her wrist was slightly bruised but her heart was crushed. \"Hey Granny is Cash out yet?\" She asked Granny Rose. \"Nope haven't seen him since last night Dixie.\" Granny Rose said. Dixie nodded and made her way to the barn house in hopes of finding him. Nothing. Cash wasn't there, nor anywhere else he usually stayed. Dixie gave up around noon and just wandered the fairgrounds in hopes of bumping into him. Cash's POV I wandered around the fair thinking about what had happened with Dix and I. I sure screwed up last night... I wonder if she'll forgive me? Wait she hit me! I should forgive her! The... Man why do I have to love her so dang much! I rubbed my cheek, it didn't hurt on the outside, no I could handle pain, but not the kind of pain I was feeling, the kind of pain that makes you want to cry, scream, and punch something. Flash back \"Cash! Pay attention!\" My mother snapped at me as I hummed a tune. She wanted me to pay attention to some silly math problem. \"Now what is the square route of 1,397,462,601?\" \"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...\" I drawled scratching my head and tugging on my red tie. \"Well?\" She demanded. \"40?\" I asked. It was wrong I knew that when her face turned red and she grabbed her leather belt and walked towards me. I always answered low in case I was wrong, I'd get slapped with her belt the same amount I answered. It stung but I learned a long time ago Tears and whining only earned me a greater punishment. \"I have tried everything with you boy! If this belt won't do it then perhaps this will!\" She took out a metal rod like what you stoke fires with and stuck it in the fireplace. She withdrew it and walked to me. I tried to back away but it was to late. I screamed as the hot metal burned my flesh near my thigh. I couldn't take it anymore, that night I climbed out of the window in my room careful not to walk in the snow. I ran and ran till I could run no more. No longer was I in the suit I wore around the house, I was in some insulated jeans, a heavy flannel brown western shirt, and some cowboy boots. I had a bandana around my neck to keep it warm as I ran from the Hell-house and demon who gave life to me. I'd go to my father but he ran off with another woman when I was three. So here I was on my own just me. Cash Nashville Hound. end flashback (regular POV) Cash and Dixie had wandered around all day, Dixie in hopes of finding Cash, and Cash in hopes of avoiding Dixie. \"Oooff!\" They both said bumping into each other at the Ferris Wheel. \"Cash?\" \"Dixie?\" \"What are you doing here?!\" They asked at the same time. \"I was looking for you!\" \"I was thinkin bout what you did last night!\" Once again they spoke at the same time. \"You were...?\" Dixie asked Feeling guilt wash over her once again. She really had hoped he would forgive her. \"I was, and if this is where we're headin' well I want to stop it before we go past the point of no return...\" Cash said he really didn't want to guilt trip her. But hopefully make-up and Kiss. They hadn't 'Kissed' in weeks, not since they got their first gig. \"I'm sorry.\" Cash said making Dixie's turn to look at him lightning quick, her hair flipping into her face. \"But you didn't hit me! I hit you! But well... I'm sorry too, I didn't think...\" Dixie murmured looking down. Cash put his hand under her chin and made her look at him. \"Now you listen here Dixie Virginia West! I love you simple as that so how's bout since we've made up, Can I have a kiss?\" Dixie giggled and leaned in to kiss the- no. HER charming cowboy! Two more years after that in Pulaski at another county fair. While the band rehearsed. \" We're in Harmony~~~~~ \" The band sang. Dixie lost herself in the song an walked around while singing every line and note. Cash stared at each curve on her body, became entranced with each swing and sway of her hips more and more right up until... Since her eyes were closed she didn't see that she was walking right into a stack of crates, making her do a flip and land in a pile of sacks. \"Dammit!\" She yelled as she picked herself up and dusted off her clothes. \"You alright Dix?\" Cash asked her as she fixed her orange colored frilly skirt. (The same color as her underbelly as a dog!) \"Yes I'm-\" \"Great now can we get back to rehearsin'?\" Cash asked her. \"Actually it's late we're stopped why don't we turn in for the night?\" Dixie suggested, only for it to be shot down by Cash. \"No, we need to get practice in!\" \"Well I for one need my beauty sleep, we can practice in the mornin'!\" Dixie snapped. \"Oh, you don't need Beauty sleep you Diva...\" Cash muttered. \"That is it! I'm out!\" Dixie stormed out of the shed her boots hitting the wood floor hardly. The band eyed Cash who in turn shrugged and said. \"She is a Diva though!\" Granny rose glared at him through her thick bangs. \"Alright, Alright I'll go apologize...\" He grumbled. Dixie walked into a little Shack where people participating in fair activities could get a drink or food. \"Give me one straight.\" Dixie mumbled to the bar tender who passed her an apple cider (non-alcoholic). \"Hello, my name's Zoe Kartwrite. nice to meet you... um...?\" Zoe said her hand out stretched. \"Dixie.\" Dixie mumbled. Her and Zoe, who was competing in a beauty compaction, talked and talked. Then they talked about their lives, more so Dixie. \"First he told me I would be the next big thing! He used to put roses in my dressing room every time I sang...\" Dixie said. \"I know!\" Zoe said nodding. \"Until I asked for a little consideration, then he called me a DIVA!\" Dixie stated in a huff. \"Yes I know, men...\" Zoe growled. \"The next thing I know he's not bringing me roses, it's all cold shoulders, cold stares! He doesn't even howl my name! all he can think about is fortune and fame! and now I can hardly excite him!\" Dixie whined like a little girl, the other 18-year-old nodded. \"Yes it happens... my boy friend Zach is the same way... unfortunately...\" Zoe grumbled. The two young women went back forth the rest of the evening. And when Dixie met the band for rehearsal she looked a mess to say the least. \"Where were you?!\" Cash demanded looking over his girl friend. \"I was at the Tap.\" She stated. that was the name of the little shack 'The Tap'. Cash didn't say anything to her until much later in the day. \"Tell me you didn't cheat on me!\" It was a statement not a question. \"I didn't Cash I would never!\" Dixie said slightly hurt that he didn't trust her. \"Ok, I believe you but when you've been gone all night an come back looking a mess I get worried!\" He said rubbing his neck. \"It's alright I'm here now aren't I?\" Dixie chuckled and leaned up and kissed him then whispered. \"Sides, I still am pure... I'm gonna save that for you Cash...\" Fanfic girl- Chapter two of meeting you is complete! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

She tired to write a letter but it was useless she couldn't find the word to tell her mother. 'Dear Ma, I need to tell-' Texas crumpled it up and tossed it to the end of the bed. 'Dear Ma, I really need to tell you... I'm-' \"No... 'Dear Ma, I'm just goin' to come out with it I'm pregnant... that's why I ran away I'm five months and safe, don't worry. Tell the others I miss them and love them.' Flashback Texas walked quickly down the road from her former high school to where her boyfriend Copper lived. She had just found out she was pregnant! Knock, knock, knock-knock, knock! \"Texas!\" Copper said opening the door. Instead of his brown tee shirt and blue jeans, he was dressed in a military uniform. \"What are, what's with the uniform Cop?\" Texas asked leaning in the door way. \"I gotta go to the training camp, I need to finish packing.\" He said. \"Please don't...\" Texas asked quietly. \"I have to! why do you ask?\" Copper asked over his shoulder as he packed shirts, socks, and so on. \"I'm pregnant...\" She whispered barely audible. \"What?\" \"I'm pregnant...\" Copper raked his hands through his hair and asked. \"You are?\" Texas nodded. \"I have to go!\" Copper said cramming things in his bag quickly then running out the door. She ran home in tears. \"Texas?\" Dixie asked when she burst through the kitchen door but she was already up stairs packing a bag. end flashback Texas sent her mother the letter. and waited. Three months passed and pain shot through her abdomen. She made her way to the down town hospital, and was rushed to a delivery room. Never before had she felt so scared. \" I wish mom was here... \" She thought, but the chances of her mother coming were slim since she had to find her first. Time passed and soon enough all the pain was over. The nurse passed her the crying little baby boy who she stared at. and he stared back with amber eyes like her. He continued to fuss and cry, so she did the only thing she knew, something her mother had done with her little sister Opry. \"6 pounds and 9 ounces, lookin' up at me Like I have all the answers I hope, I have the ones you need I've never really done this, now I know what scared is Sometimes, I'll protect you from everything that's wrong Other times, I'll let you just find out on your own But that's when you'll be growin' And the whole time I'll be knowin' You're gonna fly with every dream you chase You're gonna cry but know that that's okay Sometimes life's not fair but if you hang in there You're gonna see that sometimes bad is good We just have to believe things work out like they should Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me You're gonna be I'm afraid you'll have to suffer through some of my mistakes Lord, knows I'll be trying, oh, to give you what it takes What it takes to know the difference between getting by and livin'? Cause anything worth doing is worth doing all the way Just know you'll have to live with all the choices that you make So make sure you're always givin' way more than you're takin' You're gonna fly with every dream you chase You're gonna cry, but know that that's okay Sometimes life's not fair, but if you just hang in there You're gonna see that sometimes bad is good We just have to believe things work out like they should Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me You're gonna be Someone's everything You're gonna see Just what you are to me You're gonna fly with every dream you chase We just have to believe things work out like they should Life has no guarantees, but always loved by me You're gonna be, always loved by me You're gonna be, always loved by me~\" Texas poured her heart into the song, so what if Chennai had a way better voice, she sung from the heart. \"I always knew you had a wonderful singing voice.\" Dixie said from the door, she had walked the hallways for a while and finally deiced to come in. She had heard the WHOLE thing. \"Ma.\" Texas said tearfully, while rocking the little boy a bit. Dixie held up the letter and smiled. Texas chuckled lightly not sure whether to cry or not as her mother walked into the room setting her purse on the foot of the bed and giving Texas a hug and a light kiss also on the verge of tears. Texas lightly held up the little boy to give her other a better look. \"He's got your eyes...\" Dixie murmured running a hand gently across his cheek. \"What're ya gonna call him?\" \"Colten Nashville Hound...\" Texas whispered. Dixie just sat with her daughter the rest of the day talking about what had happened and cooing over Colten. This is a One-shot for Texas Hound, inspired by... \"Your gonna be\" By Reba McEntire! One of my favorite singers! Now just to let you know Opry is her younger sister by 16 years, she also has three younger brothers, the twins Tyler and Tucker who are ten years younger, and then the other twins Opry and Grand!

I really appreciate it! Dixie and her Daughter Texas cooed over the little baby boy in Texas' arms. Copper looked in through the door and gulped, sliding down the wall with his head in his hands. 'what did I do?' He thought, he laid the bouquet of flowers he had gotten for Texas beside him, and even though it was WAY late an engagement ring sat next to him. on one hand he could walk in with 'mom-zilla' in there and get knocked out by a swift hate, anger filled punch, on the other hand he could wait out here until Dixie left. He went with the latter. Around 8:45PM that evening He heard Dixie's fancy cowgirl boot clack against the floor, She'd be walking out in a few moments, Copper had to act fats but what? To late, he stood as Dixie walked out a large smile on her face. \"Hmm? Copper? What're you doin' out here and why ain't you in there!\" Dixie scolded him, like only a mother knew how. \"I just got here...\" He lied through his teeth. \"hmm well, I'm heading home, You best go see her...\" Dixie said an brought the tall you man in for a hug and whispered. \"thank you for that little grandboy of mine, you take care of both of them, ya hear?\" Copper nodded, picked up his things and went inside the room where Texas sat eating a peanut butter cookie, as Colten slept soundly in her arms. \"Um hey?\" He said quietly so not to wake the sleeping boy. \"Cop. *Gulp* Copper!\" Texas beamed. \"Sorry about not listening to you... and running out on you...\" Copper's head fell. \"Hey, it's ok... I forgive you.. Now get your 'I'm-so-sorry-I'm-gonna-be-all-mopey-dopey' Butt over here and say hi to our little boy...\" Texas said. She knew how to thread words, and Copper laughed. \"I'll say hi after this...'Texas Hound, will you marry me, as late as I know it is?' Please?\" Copper asked slowly. All the young girl did was smile, nod, and hold out her hand. He slipped the ring on her finger, and kissed her hand. \"So this is our little boy then?\" He asked gliding a hand across the child's face. \"Yep, I named him Colten. and I'm not changing my last name from mom's maiden name. 'West' alright?!\" Texas asked, playfully narrowing her eyes at him. \"Understood. I like that, Texas Oklahoma West, Copper Dan West, and Colten... Whatever his middle name is West!\" \"Hmm-hmm it's Nashville.\" She giggled. \"Got it. I love you two, and I'm never going to leave you guys ever again.\" Copper said as he and Texas shared a quick, passion filled kiss. Just a few months later They were at a incredibly large home. Colten fussed in the next room over, and both parents really didn't want to get up. \"Whose turn is it?\" \"Yours Cop, now get goin'!\" \"Awwwwwwwwwwwwww...\" Just weeks later they were going to Celebrate Christmas. \"He is just so cute! I could eat him up!\" Opry cooed at her youngest nephew. \"I swear, your the weirdest person ever!\" Grand said to his twin. \"But he is super cute! They all are...\" He said looking at their nieces and Nephews. \"Yep, my little sis did good!\" Austin said ruffling her fixed up hair. \"Thanks Ausie... For both...\" Texas said punching his stomach and clutching her fist in pain at his rock abs. \"Yeah, he and Autumn sure get along well, that's so not like us!\" Chennai chuckled at her daughter and Nephew. \"I Dunno... I hate to say this but... he sure is a cute little buggar!\" C.j. laughed as Texas punched his arm playfully. \"He's the cutest of them all!\" Tucker and Tyler said at the same time. \"That he is... that he is...\" Texas smiled at her son gently, Her life was just starting and she already had a husband, son, and her whole loving Family! Her life couldn't get any better than what it was.

Every incident that happened from the previous year was in the past. The bear, old Chief getting his leg broken (which Copper has long since forgiven Tod for) , all of that was ancient history. Tod and Vixey were still happily together, living in the forest. It was during a beautiful summer day that a wonderful miracle happened. On that glorious day, a beautiful fox child entered the world. It was the son of Tod and Vixey. He looked a lot like his father when he was a cub. After the magic happened, Big Mama flew by to pay Tod and Vixey a visit. \"How are you two doing? \"She asked, standing by the entrance of their den. Tod then stood up from his mate's side and then said, \"Everything is just perfect.\" He said with tears of joy streaming down his furry face. Big Mama cocked her head to the side in confusion and concern before she asked, \"What's wrong Tod? Why are you crying?\" \"Nothing. Everything is absolutely perfect.\" Tod said, laying back down by Vixey's side. \"Then why are you crying? \" Big Mama asked. \" Come in and see.\" Tod said before turning his attention back to his mate's side. Big Mama did as she was requested. She took a look around their den before getting and even more confused look on her face.\" I don't see anything wrong.\" The wise old owl said. \"Come closer.\" Tod said. She did as she was told. She walked closer towards the two young foxes. She still didn't see anything wrong. All she could see were the two foxes laying by each other. That is when she noticed that Vixey was sound asleep curled up with a little, adorable looking fox cub. She finally understood. \" Is that your kid?\" Big Mama asked while pointing at the cub. \" Yes he is.\" Tod said, not even breaking eye contact with his child and his mate. \"Congratulations you two. Have you decided on a name yet?\" Big Mama asked. \" We did a lot of thinking before we came up with the name Sebastian.\" Tod said, a wide grin sprouting on his face. \"That little guy sure is cute. I hope he grows up to be as good as his mother and father.\" Big Mama said. \" I'm sure he will.\" Tod said. \" Well, I'm sure you would like to be alone with your family today I will leave. See you three later.\" Big Mama said before flying off. That day was an absolutely perfect day for the two foxes. They now had son. They were parents. Nothing could have ruined that day. Nothing.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: First Fishing Trip \" Tod, I don't know about this. I don't think he's ready.\" A concerned Vixey said on a lovely summer day. \" Don't worry dear, he will be fine.\" Tod said with a grin. He kind of figured that Vixey would be worried. Their son was only a kit after all. \" Yeah mama, I will be fine.\" Said Sebastian excitedly. He was really stoked for what he was about to get to do for the first time. \" Okay. You better be carefull.\" Vixey said, a hint of concern still in her voice. \" I will Mama.\" Sebastian said. \" You better keep him close, Tod. I don't want to lose him.\" Vixey said. Tod giggled a little. \" Vixey, you worry to much. We will be fine.\" \" Yeah mama.\" Sebastian said. \" You better.\" Vixey said. \" Alright, lets go pal.\" Tod said. \" Right behind you papa.\" Sebastain said, as they left their den. What were doing you ask? Well, Tod was taking Sebastian on his first fishing trip. Why in the world would Tod being doing that? Everybody knows that Tod is the worst fisher fox that has ever lived. He wouldn't be much of a fishing teacher. \" Well, were here.\" Tod said when they arrived at the fishing pond. Sebastian was bouncing with excitement. \" Can we fish now papa? Can we, can we, can we?\" he asked. Tod laughed out loud. \" Hold up their buddy, I got to teach you first.\" \" Ok papa. Teach me, teach me, teach me.\" Sebastian said, still bouncing with excitement. \" Alright, walk to the edge of the pond.\" Tod said, walking to the edge of the pond. Sebastian mirrored his father and walked towards the edge of the pond. \" Ok, what now papa?\" he asked. \" He is one eager student.\" Tod thought to himself. \" Now, look into the pond. Do you see any fish.?\" Tod asked. Sebastian looked into the pond to see several fish swimming around. \"Yes Papa, I do.\" He said. \" Okay, heres what your supposed to do. When you see a fish, try to grab it. \" Tod said. \" Can I try, Papa?\" Sebastian asked. \" Of course buddy, give it a try.\" Tod said. He was thinking that Sebastian wouldn't catch one. Sebastian was very young and inexperienced. Sebastian did as his papa told him he looked into the pond. He waited for a fish to pass. It was obvious by the way he giggled a little a few minutes later that he had found one. He then dunked his head in the water and a few second later, had a fish clenched between his teeth. \" Wow, It seems we have a natural.\" Tod said, beaming with pride for his son. Sebastian spit the fish out in front of him and then said, \" Thank you papa.\" \" Well, do you think you can catch some more for mama?\" Tod asked. \" Of course papa.\" Sebastian said, then he was off to work. Within a few minutes a pile of fish was laying on the forest floor. \" Well, were going to have to take these home.\" Tod said picking fish up with his mouth. \" Yeah, lets go papa.\" Sebastian said before picking up a fish as well and walking back to the den. They were back at the den within a couple of minutes. \" I see it went well.\" Vixey said with a smile. Tod and Sebastian set there fish on the ground. \" Our son is a natural. He easily caught twenty fish.\" Tod said, smiling. \" Yeah mama, I did good.\" Sebastian said. \" I am so proud of you, son. Wait, did you say twenty? You only brought back two.\" Vixey confusingly asked. \" We got to go back for the rest.\" Tod said.[Chapter 3] Fox and the Hound : Miracle: Chapter 3 ( Before I get started, I have to say, sorry for the really long wait for a new chapter in this. Been experiencing some severe writers block for a long time and I only just now got an idea for a chapter in this. Sorry again) It was a very special day for Sebastian. He was finally getting to meet his Uncle Copper. He'd been looking forward to meeting him for a long time. Tod had talked to Vixey and she very reluctantly said yes. She still wasn't too horribly fond of Copper because of what happened with them that one summer. Copper even admitted that it wasn't the best time. He admits that he overreacted to Chief breaking his leg. Anyways, the fox family were in the burrow, eagerly waiting for the hound dog to come visit. \" Are you sure about this, Tod?\" Vixey said, still a little reluctant. \" Absolutely. He's not a bad dog. He just had a bad master. \" Sebastian shivered at the the thought of Amos Slade. \" Meany! Meany! Meany! \" He said. Tod giggled at that. \" Yes, yes he is. He got a taste of his own medicine. He broke his leg. \" Vixey nodded. \" I know this sounds mean, but I hope he never heals. He's a bad, bad man.\" \" Yes, yes he is. But at least you don't have to put up with him every day. \" Said a voice from behind them. Sebastian turned around along with his family to see the hound dog that was Copper. Sebastian was getting excited. \" Uncle Copper? \" He said. Copper giggled and said. \"Oh, you caught me. Did the floppy ears and the big wet nose give me away?\" \"Uhhhhhh. \" was all Sebastian could think to say. Copper giggled again and said, \" Hey little buddy, I was just joking. \" \" Oh, okay. \" Sebastian said with a great big smile. Copper noticed Vixey and saw the reluctant look on her face and decided to reassure her. \" Tod's mate, I know you're worried but I promise you, I won't try to eat you guys. Well, the little one does look tasty but I'm not going to. \" Copper said. He couldn't help but throw a joke into that. Vixey jumped in front of her son protectively. \" Well, the tasty little one isn't going to be leaving my side at all when you're here, dog. \" Vixey said, Tod sighed and said, \" Copper, this was a bad idea. You should just go. \" He was really dissapointed that Vixey clearly still didn't forgive the dog no matter how much he changed. \" No! Mama! Don't let him go. \" Sebastian said. He was looking forward to this for a long time and it was really blowing up. * Don't worry little buddy. That's not going to happen. I understand why your mom is being like this. She's protective of you. But, I have something fun planned for all of us and maybe she'd change her mind about me.\" Copper said, not even trying to be subtle about this. Copper looked at Tod and Vixey and said, \" I was going to take you guys out swimming. I just wanted some time to bond with the little guy over one of my favorite activities .\" \" But if you really want me to leave, then I will. \" He said before turning to leave. Vixey sighed and took of running to the swimming hole. She could be playful sometimes to. Tod giggled and took off running to and left Sebastian back in the dust. \" Hey! No fair. You know I have little legs. \" He said before running off himself. He arrived at the swimming hole and noticed nobody there. He was getting a little scared. \" Mama? Papa? Uncle Copper? \" He would soon find out his fear was for nothing. The fox, the vixen and the hound dog were waiting for just the right moment for something . They all jumped out of the bush they were hiding in and all yelled. \" Surprise!\" and all ran up to him and pushed him in the water. Sebastian resurfaced from the water and giggled and said \" Good one guys. Papa, Uncle Copper, it doesn't surprise me that you did this. But Mama? \" \" It took alot of convincing .\" Vixey said before jumping into the water, followed by Copper and Tod. They spent hours and hours at that swimming hole. They were soon back at the burrow. \" So, am I still that bad dog that you knew?\" Copper asked. Vixey shook her head and smiled. \" We have to do this again sometimes.\" \"Agreed.\" Tod said. Sebastian was jumping up and down, excited. \" Yes, yes, yes!\" Copper smiled and said \" Well, I have to go. \" ( Sorry about the wait. If I would have known people were liking this story so much, I would have tried to update sooner. ) ","Summary":" The Fox and the Hound: Miracle By: Tails12365 1 year had passed.

He shakes. Not like a leaf, but like someone that´s been in cold water for too long. It´s just a dream, a nightmare. Manny is dead. Mom is dead. It´s over. The war is over. He steps into the shower, clothes on and everything, the water is temperatured, but quickly turns warmer as he turns up the heat, his wife beater sticks to his torso and the cotton boxers he wears are drooping off his body. Breathing heavily he pushes his hands into the wall of the shower, the tiles are wet, but his fingers still grip onto the edges of the tiles as he tries to close his eyes, trying to remember a reason to hold onto reality. Her. The soft blonde hair falling down her shoulders, big brow eyes looking at him and smiling, chuckling as he looks at her. The fall of her skirt, the innocent look in her eyes when he´s inside of her, the warmth of her body pressed against his. The smell of peaches flair his nostrals and its like he´s back home in Pittsbourgh again, waiting outside of her diner for her to come home with him. They are sixteen. He punches the tiles of the shower with his fist, making the skin on his knuckles split and bleed. Where the fuck was she now? Probably married, pregnant, living in a house with a picket fence and a normal husband. Normal! He could have been normal for her. He wanted to be normal for her, he wanted to be good and safe and give her the life she deserved. Too bad he ran before he even got to say goodbye. She was better off. Stepping out of the shower he looks himself in the mirror again, its like a faint ghost looking back at him, his grey eyes are hooded, tired and sleep deprived. He strips down, leaving his wife beater and boxers in a wet pile right next to the shower. His hand bleeds as he takes it under the water of the sink, making the porcilain of it turn a bright red then pink. The cut is minor, he´ll survive. Fuck he´ll survive. That´s not even what he wants. Walking back into the bedroom he knows the remedy for the pain, he didnt even understand why he bothered to stop in the first place. A bottle of Jack Daniels stationed on his nightstand, he twists the cap with his bruised hand, biting his jaw from the pain coming from the knuckles. Puts the mouth of the bottle to his lips, taking a powerful sip that burns down his throat and takes the sting off everything. The world disapears, his body feels limp as he falls back on the bed, he doesnt think anymore, doesnt need to, he´s found his poison.

In 1979 Paddy Conlon meets Beverly Riordan in a diner. That's when this all starts. . . . He doesn't really know how the drinking starts. (Lie. He knows. Times get tough and the extra beer after dinner turns into a whole six pack and a simple shove during a fight becomes the love of his life curled up on the floor with blood coming out her nose. God, he's so sorry, Bev. She deserves better. The boys deserves better. He's fucking pathetic. He can't even look in the mirror any more because he hates the reflection. He's weak and she knows it. They know it. Fuck them, he's not weak. He'll show them just how weak he is.) . . . When he is in kindergarten, Tommy's teacher gives them a piece of paper with several puzzle drawn on it. She tells them, \"Your family is like a puzzle. There are different pieces with different colors or pictures, but they all connect to make a big, happy family.\" Tommy scrawls out Mommy, Pop, Brendan, and Tommy on four of the pieces and colors them in. That's his family. They all fit together to make a picture. They're the puzzle. . . . Sometimes the fighting gets really loud, so loud it seems to shake the house, and Brendan is still surprised it hasn't caved in yet. He may be nine, but he isn't stupid: he knows what his father is doing to Mom and he knows that it's wrong. But Brendan isn't strong enough to protect her yet, only Tommy. He curls himself around his little brother, tightening his grip. \"Brendan?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Why is Pop hitting Mom?\" \"I don't know, Tom, go to sleep.\" There's a minute of silence between them, then- \"Brendan?\" \"What?\" \"He won't hit us, will he?\" \"I won't let him. Don't worry, just sleep.\" \"Brendan.\" \"Tommy, I-\" \"Would you hit me?\" \"No. Never.\" \"Promise?\" \"Promise. Shh, go to sleep.\" . . . Pop like Greek legends and wrestling. Fortunately, so does Tommy. He wins his first match and the whole family goes to get ice cream. He wins his second and his third and loses his fourth. Pop takes him out to the parking lot and beats the living shit out of him. He is ten years old. (Dad leaves the puzzle after that. But there are two other pieces still, so Tommy is okay. It's just him and Brendan and Mom, the unit, and they are the only people in the world that matter.) . . . Tess first sees Brendan Conlon when she's fifteen and he's sixteen. He's a beefy football player who manages to pull straight As. When they meet up at a party, he gets into a fight, wins, and spends the next half hour talking about Stephen Hawking. She's hooked. They have dinner with Mrs. Conlon and Tommy, his little brother. They go to Ritter's and it's not as awkward as she thought it would be. Brendan's mom seems to be really nice and his little brother is very quiet. Brendan tells her it's nothing personal, he doesn't talk much, but she swears he was glaring at her from across the booth. The first time they have sex, she learns that his dad has been beating him up for years. He doesn't care, but she doesn't know if she can fix a boy who's so broken. He kisses her and her doubt ebbs. . . . They have a plan. Their bags are packed. The three of them are going to leave while Paddy's at work. He stays with Tess the night before they're supposed to leave. They go see a movie and get dinner and she tells her she thinks she's pregnant on the ride home. He isn't mad, he's happy. He loves this girl, adores her, and he wants a family with her. After they pull over to hug, he finds a phone booth and calls his mom. \"I might want to stay.\" Nothing. \"I love her, Ma. I don't want to live without her.\" \"Is she worth it?\" Brendan looks over his shoulder at the girl in question, who is currently leaning against his car as snow falls (She'll lose the baby after she falls down some stairs. They'll bury him next to her sister on a February morning). \"Yeah.\" His mom takes a deep breath. \"Okay. Take the night to think about it. We'll wait in the parking lot and if you ain't there by four, we'll leave without you.\" \"Okay.\" \"I love you, Brendan. I always have and I always will. Remember that.\" (These are the last words she'll ever say to him.) \"I will. You too.\" (Vise versa.) . . . They wait in the Factory parking lot for an hour. Two. When the clock hits five, Mom starts crying and turns the key. (And three pieces become two.) . . . The first night is the worst. Pop drinks himself into a rage and pulls all of the pictures off the wall. He throws Brendan into the wall and cracks his ribs and collapses onto the floor, crying for Bev. It's pathetic and Brendan doubts him for the first time. . . . The house is a piece of shit with poor lighting and a musky smell, but the two of them are together. Some nights they sit together on her bed, watching bad movies and eating ice cream. Other nights they go to the community center and he pounds on a bag while she swims. It's not a fancy life, but no one is hitting them everyday. He does okay in school, makes lots of Bs. Every report card goes on the fridge next to the pictures of Brendan and his grandparents. The crucifix hangs on the wall next to the stove and she's constantly praying. Praying for them, for Brendan, for Pop. He asks her, \"Why do you pray for the man who beat you and the son who stayed with him?\" \"I love them, Tommy. Even your father. Someday you'll understand.\" (Sixteen years later, he'll be holding his wife and new son and he cannot fathom how he could stop loving them.) . . . He misses Bev. So bad. He blocks out Brendan, he blocks out Tommy, he blocks out life. He hates them, he hates her, but he doesn't. Time goes by. Brendan leaves. He's all alone. Good. He ruins everything he touches. . . . He puts himself through school by fighting and Tess's tips. He doesn't want to take them, but she practically forces them into his hands. It isn't much, but it's enough. He hates it. The first time he goes to the restaurant, Brendan watches three guys grab her ass. He hovers over her the rest of the night and asks her to marry him a week later. They get married in September under the changing leaves. His father is not invited. He wishes he could find them, tell them how happy he was with Tess. Mom would be overjoyed and Tommy would have sat there, silent but happy for his brother. . . . She gets sicker and sicker every week, he can tell. She starts throwing up a lot and her joints get so sore she can't walk. Most nights are spent in bed with a cup of tea and Friends. Once they even got into their bathing suits and sat in the tub together so he could hold her up. They only seperate to go to school or to work, but soon she can't leave the house, she's in so much pain. He makes enough to pull rent, just barely, and he starts making more once graduation comes and goes. The last night is the worst. It's cold and she is wracking with spasms and coughing up blood. Everytime suggests going to the hospital, she refuses to go. So he wraps her up in his arms and blankets, and they just wait. She dies around one in the morning on December 17th, in a shoebox in Tahoma. (And the puzzle becomes a single, angry piece.) . . . The fights are getting worse and worse. Both of Brendan's eyes are swollen and his back is red from hitting the floor so much. Tess leans against the doorframe and watches her husband wash his face with cold water. They've been hopping from one cheap motel to another, trying to raise enough money for a teaching license. Their eyes connect in the murky mirror. \"I'm pregnant.\" He stands bent over the sink for a few beats, and then turns around to drop to his knees in front of her, like she's a shrine and needs to be worshipped. Fighting may be in his blood, but she's in his bones. . . . \"I'm telling you, Paddy, you gotta find that bitch,\" Don Walowitz says, taking a swig of his beer. \"I tell you what, my brother-in-law, he knows this guy in Philly. Give him two weeks, he'll find your lady and kid.\" \"I dunno.\" \"Trust me. Here's his number.\" . . . His father shows up to Emily's first birthday wasted. He's just handed off his daughter to her uncle when Tess shows up behind him. \"Your dad's here.\" Brendan storms across the street in a rage. He's slumped over the steering wheel, his clothes rumpled and eyes bleary. \"You stupid sunovabitch! It is my daughter's birthday and you show up drunk, you fucker! Get the hell away from me and my family!\" \"Brendan! I-I found 'em. I found Tommy. And your mother,\" Paddy slurs as he tries to sit up straight. \"Tommy is a-a Marine.

God, he's all grown up.\" \"What?\" Brendan pulls back like he's just seen something disgusting. \"What are you talking about?\" \"I hired a guy, a friend of Donny's, and he found 'em. They were in fuckin' Tahoma. Tahoma. Went to the whole other side of the country to get away from us,\" his father says, wiping his nose on his jacket. Brendan feels his anger rush back. \"No, they left to get away from you, you abusive fuck head. Go to hell.\" \"Your mother's dead. Died back in '01. Tommy had her buried out there. She should- she should be here, she belongs here.\" Through the haze, Brendan can remember saying, \"Get your shit together, Paddy,\" before he goes back inside and locks the door. . . . Tommy doesn't know how long he sat there with Manny's body, but when one of the medics tried to pry him from his arms, he lashes out and almost takes the man's head off. Manny is his brother, was his brother, he won't leave him. They give him medicine for the pain; he steals three more bottles. They let him talk to Pillar on the phone and they cry together. He promises to take care of her and the kids. He doesn't say anything else for a week. A person can only take so much pain and so much loss before they start getting angry. And not the kind of anger that leaves after you yell a bit. It's a deep, dark anger and you can feel it in your bones. It's the kind of anger that doesn't accept apologies and can only be cured by hurting the people that hurt you (Only it doesn't, it just feeds the anger, makes it stronger, lets it take control). Time passes. Anger keeps growing. People stop understanding. (And the angry, little piece stops putting up with it.) . . . The night Tommy comes back home, a member of Paddy's group falls of the bandwagon. As the man sobs into his hands, the young woman next to him says, \"We have to fall sometimes. It reminds us how to get back up.\" Paddy fiddles with his cross and thinks of Ahab. . . . Tess sits in the back of the auditorium during the school board meeting. Afterwards, she sits in her van and cries. . . . He finds an extra bottle of pills in his bag three days before Sparta. He puts them on the bedside table and lies down. He could take a few just to piss the old man off; he's been riding Tommy's ass for the past two months and that shit's getting annoying. (The devil you know.) Tommy shakes the bottle a little. She'd be so fucking mad if she knew what he was doing. The fighting, the drugs, the hate. (He used to get so mad sometimes he would shake, and she'd wrap him up in her arms until the shivers stop. Where is she now?) . . . He and Frank are sitting in the hotel room, reading the programs when the story airs. The young man reminds him of one of his students. He calls his father for the first time since he moved out. The Tommy he finds on the beach is so old, so broken, so mad. Brendan knows it's silly, but some part of him was hoping to the find the fourteen year old boy who left him. Instead he finds a man almost crippled with anger, who wants to hurt him with sharp words and bitter memories. . . . The vodka tastes bitter going down. He vaguely remembers someone shushing him. God, stop the ship. . . . When his superior is out of range, one of the officers asks, \"Why'd you run?\" The other one glares at him. \"My brother died.\" \"Aren't you fighting your brother?\" \"He's not my brother. He's just some guy, you know? My real brother's dead.\" The superior returns, and they sit in the locker room, listening to the shower drip. . . . He feels the shoulder pop under his body and his brother screams. Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. He isn't scared when Tommy wraps his hand around his throat. Your mind gets blurry in the fight, emotion takes over, you lash out. Tommy fights hard and angry, and Brendan knows he's the source of the rage. When they drag his brother away from him, he panics. He thinks he was screaming his name, he's not sure. Please, Tommy, stop. He looks over Frank's shoulder at his little brother. Tommy's curled in on himself, gripping the cage. Crying. Let this end. Please. . . . He watches his sons hit the floor. Stop the ship, Ahab. Stop the ship. . . . \"I love you, Tommy!\" . . . \"Would you hit me?\" \"No. Never.\" \"Promise?\" \"Promise.\" . . . He feels his brother cradeling him in his arms, holding his face, whispering nothings. Tommy folds inwards as he stands up, Brendan's arms around him. His brother presses his forehead to his temple as they walk out of the ring and into the crowd. (And the puzzle is complete.) . . . \"And once the storm is over you won't remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won't be the same person who walked in.\"- Haruki Murakami . . .

I couldn't help but feel a sigh of relief, as I knew you finally recognized it was time to stop and settle down. \"That's my boy.\" I thought proudly as I released my grip on you allowing you to take in some much needed oxygen at that point. Eyeing your shoulder I had just dislocated I began to feel guilt rising in my chest realizing I had hurt you. This did not sit well with me. Hearing the loud roar of the crowd I ignored that immediately going into protective big brother mode. Crouching down to look at your face I began to worry. You were unable to move and that frightened me. I tried to get you up but you just stayed with your head down on the ground. As you curled into yourself I began to worry even more and began stroking your hair soothingly. Caringly whispering, \"It's okay little brother listen to me, you're okay. I'm so proud of you. It's over now kiddo you just breathe now. Try to stay with me okay. Glancing around I saw the cameras making their way towards us so I tried to wrap a gentle arm around you and ease you up onto your feet to get you safely away. Your body refused to respond so immediately I crouched down in front of you again cupping your face gently in my hands to look into your eyes. Bringing my forehead to press against yours I closed my eyes for a moment as I felt you tremble and my heart broke. Once again whispering, \"Its okay baby brother, come on buddy, easy I've got you let's try this again okay?\" Gently again I tried pulling you up this time you collapsed into me shivering and sobbing. I needed to get you away and now. I rubbed your back soothingly for a moment whispering, \"it's okay you're alright we're getting you out of here.\" Keeping my arm comfortingly around you I practically carried you out of the ring and down to the locker room. I refused to acknowledge the audience members giving their praise as I guided you away from them. Pressing my forehead to yours I said softly in his ear, \"It's okay everything's okay just ignore them it'll be okay I'm getting you out of here buddy.\" Finally reaching the locker room I gently eased you down and said softly, \"Okay kiddo let's see that shoulder okay? We may need to get you to the hospital to fix it up just take it easy.\" Hearing you in pain broke my heart. Carefully examining the wounded shoulder I let out a sigh of concern. \"Okay buddy I have to pop your shoulder back in. This is going to hurt just a bit okay you squeeze my hand and don't let go. Just ride out the pain okay? On the count of three little brother okay? One, two, three.\" Soothingly I rubbed your back in small circles until I felt your muscles begin to relax under my touch. Gently taking a towel and smoothing your sweat soaked hair back like I used to do, I wiped away the smudges of blood. Again pressing my forehead to his lovingly I said softly, \"Okay kiddo we have to get you to the hospital and get this shoulder taken care of. We just gotta make sure it's not worse than it looks alright?\" I felt you nod into my shoulder and I smiled softly in return gently rubbing your back again for a moment to further calm you, I whispered softly, \"Good you're gonna be just fine. I promise.\" Checking the shoulder over a little more carefully satisfied for the moment it would be okay, I quickly threw on a shirt, and helped you into one yourself. Easing you up slowly onto his feet I could see you swaying a bit and quickly caught you saying soothingly, \"easy, easy I gotcha.\" Wrapping an arm around your shoulder I gently guided you out to the car, opened the door and got you into the seat carefully. Turning the engine on I glanced over to you worriedly, not liking how pale your face had just gotten. Reaching across I stroked your hair for another second to soothe the pain as much as I could. Upon arriving at the hospital in record time, I quickly jumped out and ran to your side. Getting the passenger side door open, I carefully wrapped my arm around you again to help you balance. I walked into the hospital with you as fast as I possibly could. I quickly cried for some help as I could feel you beginning to give all your weight into me, unable to keep steady much longer, so I held you tighter. A nurse came running over and quickly grabbed a wheelchair. She turned to me and asked gently, \"What's his name son? And can you explain what happened?\" Weakly I nodded, and explained that you and I were in a boxing match earlier as we both needed the money to support ourselves. I told her about how it turned out I had to go up against my own baby brother and had to hurt him to get the money. At that moment I felt nothing but guilt. Feeling like I should have said no to fighting you, my own brother how could I do such an awful thing? Let alone to my younger brother? It's my job to protect you not harm you. I couldn't help but think as I watched you being taken to a room in the back to be checked over, \"Oh Tommy, what have I done?\" Sitting listening silently as the doctor listened to your breathing my heart constricted. As I heard every weak gasp for breath it tore at my heart. I couldn't stand to listen to you, my little brother in so much pain. The pain I caused you. Quietly I suddenly heard your weak raspy voice ask, \"Br-Bren?\" I smiled softly and moved forward squeezing your hand and replied gently, \"It's okay little brother I'm right here buddy you're alright. It's almost over okay?\" Running a series of tests and checking his throat the doctor was positive that you would make a full recovery. I let out a big shaking sigh of relief. The doctor did however request you stay with someone while your shoulder heals completely. Instantly I replied, \"He's my brother he stays with me.\" Glancing at you I saw a look of shock and somewhat of an argumentative look on your face. I gave you a stern big brother look in response that clearly said, \"You're coming home with us no excuses little bro.\" You instantly let out an exasperated weak sigh and I chuckled in response, as we both knew arguing was useless. Clearing you with the doctor, and helping you get dressed, I smiled gently and said, \"Come on bro let's get you home.\" Walking out to the car we never lost the physical contact between us. I think we both needed the comfort of having each other again that we were not ready to lose that. Unlocking the passenger side once again I gently helped you in, shutting the door, and getting in on the drivers side. Smiling at you fondly I noticed you were practically asleep before we even left the hospital. I chuckled quietly to myself, ruffling your hair gently and started the engine. Arriving in the driveway a few minutes later, soothingly I patted you on the head again and said softly, \"Tommy, come on bro wake up we're here.\" Reminiscing again I recognized the sleepy eyes of a young Tommy waking up in the morning and laughed. I helped you out of the car, down the walkway and wrapped a steady arm around you saying, \"Easy bro I got you. Take it easy.\" Gently leaning him back on the top step for a moment I pulled the key out, placed it back, then wrapped my arm around you again and guided you into the house. Smiling at my wife Tess regardless of any arguments she may have, I was now back in big brother mode and would not accept no as answer. Especially not when my little brother's involved. I told her quietly, \"Tommy's staying with us for a while until his shoulder heals completely at least. And I just need to have him here with me for a while. I have a lot to make up for with him. This is just a starting point.\" Tess nodded acceptingly and sighed, \"Okay I guess that's okay.\" I nodded and couldn't help but also recognize that you had not yet met my two daughters. You are going to be an uncle little brother.\" I chuckled quietly as I little by little helped you up the stairs and down to the guestroom. For tonight I needed you with me just to prove you were here with me, and this was not some practical joke. So I helped you lie down on the bed as I saw a wince of pain cross your face. I gently smoothed the hair out of your eyes as I had done when you were little. Whispering in your ear, \"Ssssshhh easy bro it's okay you're okay now, just lie still okay.\" Waiting a moment in consideration I was planning to run back to my room and grab a pillow and some blankets. But then I thought we both needed the physical contact tonight, to know we're both here. And we're together again after all these years. Quietly getting ready for bed I listened for any noises any signs that would indicate any nightmares or anything. Thankfully it appeared you were okay tonight. Making my way over to the bed I silently sat down on the edge again carefully scooting over. I wrapped my arm around you holding you tightly not wanting to ever let you go. As I got comfortable by you I felt you beginning to stir under my touch. I pressed my lips into your hair for a second soothingly whispering, \"Ssssshhh it's okay it's just me. Go back to sleep. Big brother's here I've got you it's okay.\" Under my soothing words I began to circle my fist into your tense muscles in your back encouraging them to relax. Letting a few minutes more pass just like this I felt you steadily begin to calm under me, and fall into a deep sleep. One thought went through my mind at that moment as I began to fall asleep right after, that no matter what happened, after all this time, I had my baby brother again safe with me where I could protect him at all costs. There was one thing for sure that this was a moment in my life I would never take for granted ever again.

If it's shit, you've been warned. This one's for my auntie. I love you. \"I know you'll come in the night like a thief But I've had some time alone to hold my lies inside me I know you think that I'm someone you can trust But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up\" - Jesus Christ, Brand New Floor boards would gently creek as the door to the nursery let light pass into the dark room, she was watching her sleep, the child they both never expected. With her curly hair slightly shimmering in the light, her fist nuzzled up to her mouth, sleeping on her stomach. The woman watching her leaned against the door frame, just watching the little girl's body rise and fall as she slept, not aware of the world around her. The woman would envy the little one at times, being six years old, running around the house, not knowing left from right, still being able to be picked up in someone's arms and cradled from the world. The figure watching her sleep moved slightly away, closing the door shut, her boyfriend was home, a wide shouldered man, with a chip on his shoulder and alcohol on his breath. She knew him best this way, angry and shouting at her to give the girl back, but she never listened and tonight was no different. He was a bit more sober tonight then other nights, rummaging through the fridge to find a beer, she walked into the kitchen grabbing one of the plates to put them in the dishwasher. When he finally found a beer, he popped the cork open and put it to his lips draining the bottle of its content like he had never drank a liquid before. She gazed at him, he hated when she did that, the judgment clearly shown on her face. They would fight every night over this, but she wasn't up for it, not now. -\"Here\" he passed her a beer, even bothered to open it for her, his kindness surprised her at times seeing he would rarely display any these days. The phone rang as she took the beer from him, none of them answered it instead they let it go directly to voicemail as they both stared at each other. She noticed the purple bruise around his eye and that he had a white bandage around his wrist. -\"Tommy, hi, it's Brendan, I know you said not to call, but, it's bad man, Pop's is in the hospital, I know we promised Tommy, but..please, just call me, alright or come down here yourself, if not for him, then for me\" the message stopped playing as Tommy finished the rest of his beer leaving the empty bottle in the sink. She put her hand on his heavy back when he walked passed her to get to the living room, -\"Tommy, you have to talk to him\" -\"Please, Angie, not with this crap again\" his accent was thick and annoyed, she pulled her hand away from his warm back staring down at her beer bottle. He didn't move for a long time, just stood there, she couldn't read off his body language when he locked himself away like this, all he knew was pain, so this was a shoe in for what came after: anger. -\"You gonna give Theresa back tomorrow\" he asked, his shoulders tense and head cocked down, -\"No, I was thinking I'd keep her around a little longer\" Tommy sneered, -\"We aint raising your sister's kid\" -\"I didn't fucking say that!\" she hissed back in response, moving passed him, but he got a pretty hard grip around her wrist pulling her to him, now he was just pushing it, she hated him when he became like this and he damn well knew that. -\"Don't start with me, Tommy\" she pulled at her hand trying to get away from his grip, he dragged her to him, grabbing both of her wrists so the beer bottle in her other hand slipped out and spilled all over the rug. -\"You wanna keep her?\" he asked, as she avoided his stare by arching her back away from him and glancing at the kitchen counter. -\"Look at my, Angie!\" Her eyes met his, she was angry and he was strong, still not letting her out of his grip, -\"After all of this, you think we could raise a fucking kid, you and I?\" The short woman tore herself away from hin backing up against the counter, -\"If this is some goddamn punishment Tommy, you should be gunning for yourself\" she charged out of the kitchen and up the stairs. He reached her, in a couple of quick steps, yelling up the stairs, -\"What the fuck is that suppose to mean, you stupid bitch?\" Her small body ran down the stairs as she stood above him on the last step, finally feeling the higher standard of being above him, -\"You're scare, Tommy, ever since you're father got sick, you've been back in the ring getting the shit beaten out of you, so you won't feel anything. Don't you fucking dare come here and call me names and judge me, at least I'm standing up for my family, you abandoned yours\" He stepped away from her, clearly showing restraint from her remark, but not for long, he was back in her face, eyes hooded, nose wrinkled and jaw clenched along with his fists, -\"Protecting your niece from your junkie sister? Huh? You wanna show sweet little Tessa your scars when she gets older, tell her stories about how auntie Angie wanted to slit her own wrists so daddy would stop touching her. You got the balls to do that, Ang, huh?\" The slap across his face echoed and the tears streaming down hers face followed in him backing away from her, slamming a strong fist into the concrete of the wall. She walked down the last steps of the stairs going for Theresa's room, -\"You know what Tommy, maybe I should take my fucked up family elsewhere so I don't interrupt you and your saint like alcoholic fucking up mess of a life\" He grabbed her again, pinning her up against the door of the nursery, breathing heavily into her lips, squeezing her wrist's to a point where he knew that it would leave a mark, -\"Try and live without me Angie, I fucking dare you\" -\"I don't need you Tommy, you know what you need, you need? You need your mommy to come here and fix everything, along with your daddy and that whole fucking goddamn picked fence idea in your screwed up fantasy\" she yelled in his face trying to get away, -\"Go on, fucking hit me, you weak little man, hit me, become your father, go on, someone's gotta take his fucking place now that he's dying!\" The words dropping around him made Tommy's eyes go blank; he stepped away from her as she realized that she took it too far. Angie moved herself away from the door, following him into the living room, -\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry\" crying after him, holding her hand in front of her mouth, -\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry\" Tommy pushed a lamp over in the living room, grabbing his jacket from the sofa, as she kept following him, -\"Please don't leave, I'm sorry, Tommy, please stay, please, you're right, I'm nothing without you, I can't do this without you, please, I'm sorry\" she yelled after him as he walked through the door and into the night, the crying made her body shake when she saw his back disappear around the corner. Angie curled up on the sofa, after cleaning up the beer and changing into one of Tommy's old t-shirt's which still smelled of him, it was his navy draft shirt, it had his station number on the back and his name in the front \"Thomas Conlon\" Her nerve's was shot, she was drinking a new beer, with her legs pushed up to her chest looking blankly at the lit TV screen, letting her glance fall over on the window next to the TV, making sure she saw him if he ever came back, they would fight, they fought all the time, but this was worse, she was worse. As she fell asleep with the TV playing a couple of hours later the man she had been waiting for returned, his eyes were red and he closed the door gently behind him, taking off his jacked, sniffling as he walked passed her half cover body on the sofa. She peeked up from behind it, -\"Tommy\" He wouldn't respond, not a word, she stood up, followed him upstairs to their bedroom, -\"Tommy, I'm sorry, I was a bitch, I'm so sorry, I went too far, we should go visit your father\" he shook his head, taking off his shoes by the bed, sitting down, taking off his pants, she kept her distance in the fear that he would snap at her again. -\"I love you, just, let's take Tessa with us to go see Paddy tomorrow\" Tommy shook his head again, taking off his sweater letting it fall right next to his jeans, he had a wife beater on, which he took off as well, she saw his bare back, bruised and battered, he had been fighting more then he should, even with prior injuries. Angie walked herself to his side of the bed, sitting down next to him, he kept his head down, holding his hands together, she put her fingers over his clutched fingers, letting them slip in-between. -\"I can't give her back, Tommy, I know Theresa deserves better than me, but I just can't give her back to my sister, not when she's using, I can't let her grow up in the same way I did\" He shook his head again, without a word, -\"Do you want us to leave?\" she asked him, he shook his head again, kept shaking his head until his shoulders started shaking and he let out a quiet sob which filled the room and Angie's eyes. -\"He's dead, Angelia, my dad died tonight\" he looked up at her and she froze, looking at the broken man that was Tommy Conlon with his weeping eyes. She had never seen him cry before, but she cried with him, embracing him as he shook around her arms. -\"I'm so sorry\" she cried into his naked shoulder, his arms moved her body closer to his so they were pressed together like his life depended on it. -\"Jesus Christ\" he cried harder into the fabric of her t-shirt, overtaking her small body until she felt his hulking deep in his chest. They didn't let each other go, she just stroked his hair as he kept holding her until his body quit shivering and the tears stopped. Afterwards he lay on his back with Angie on her side looking at him, not letting her hand slip out of his which was resting on his chest. She watched over him, the only way she knew how, he looked peaceful in his sleep and she thanked God and Patrick Conlon for bringing him to her, because he had saved her life more than once. -\"I love you\" he muttered to her as she pressed her face into his neck, breathing him in –\"I love you too\" ","Summary":" I'm sorry about the spelling mistakes, I couldn't look through this again without crying and I have"},{"Movie":"Warrior, 2011","Title":"They Warned Him About Her - One shot","Author":"ColdSideOfTheWorld","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8975084","Passage":"[Chapter 1] All this bad blood here, wont you let it dry, it's been cold for years, wont you let it lie? I don't wanna hear about the bad blood anymore I don't wanna hear you talk about it anymore -Bad Blood, Bastille Tommy Conlon's back was always pressed against the wall with everything he did in life. This had to shake itself out; the pain had to leave, so he did his best with whatever he was given: being a seventeen year old with an abusive father and a dead mother. His brother was to no help, Brendan had already moved out to marry Tess, a very sweet girl, which Tommy never got, he couldn't understand his brother's betrayal over a girl. It wasn't until he met Alex that it all changed; she was aggressive, kind and had a chip on her shoulder. Alex was just as self-destructive as Tommy, maybe that's why he was so attracted to this short blonde. -\"You're gonna stare a hole through my head, Conlon, if you keep looking at me like that\" Alex grinned at him, while he was lost in his own thoughts. It was the last class before the end of the day and he was focused on the French revolution and Alex's new top, it had a deep cleavage which made him jealous every time a guy passed their table, looking at her. -\"New top?\" he commented putting the history book down. Tommy was sure she knew what she was doing with her new outfits that entailed: short skirts, tops with cleavages, dark painted nails and an equally smug grin over her full glossy lips. Alex's hazel eyes glowed as she bit her bottom lip; -\"I'm not wearing a bra if you wanna cop a field\" she whispered so low that he felt the shiver of her words down his spine. -\"Don't be tacky, Alex\" his cool was wearing off around her. Alex had him by the chokehold and he loved it, hell, it was his only material thinking of her dominating him with those deep eyes and soft mouth when his hand would wander down his pants at night when he was alone. -\"..not everyone is a virgin, Conlon, most of us have a little tacky in us, no pun intended\" her smile widened as she put her pencil in her mouth, Tommy folded his book together, pissed off at this, she would always question his virginity when he tried to stop her from acting out. -\"It's getting old\" he stood up ready to leave, when she shouted at him so loud that everyone turned their heads at her, -\"You want me to take your virginity then?\" -\"Fuck you, Alex\" he hissed putting his middle finger up while walking away, letting that stabbing feeling of wanting to say yes leave his body, -\"That was the offer\" she hollered after him. The question of sex never left his mind even at home by the dinner table, he didn't want to think about it, not while his father was having his afternoon drink and interrogation about his grades and future wrestling matches. All Tommy was thinking about was if Alex ever decided to climb through his window like she does once and a while. -\"Are you still hanging out with Alex St. James?\" his father asked sipping on a mixture of Whiskey and cola, while Tommy poked a vegetable with his fork, his diet was strict: no sweets, no drinking, just protein: chicken, vegetables, all of this so he would bulk up enough for the next wrestling match. It was a lot of money and he hadn't lost yet. -\"I see her around school\" he didn't look at his father, avoiding his look when he put the glass down, -\"Stay away from that child, she's just pure trouble, her mother is a prostitute and god knows she's only to follow in her footsteps with those trashy clothes\" Tommy didn't respond, just took his dish to the sink, put it down and turned to leave, -\"You listening to me, boy?\" his father grabbed his arm, Tommy jerked it away from his grip, -\"Don't touch me again\" -\"You got a lot riding on this wrestling match, Tommy, don't fuck it up over some whore\" Paddy's sharp words made Tommy clench his fists, pushing his father down into his chair, -\"I'ma listen, pop's, alright, now leave me be\" Going upstairs again, Tommy opened the door to his bedroom seeing the harlot his father just spoke about spread over his bed reading a book, with her backpack against his headboard and her skirt ridden up above her thighs showing the outline of her panties. Her head turned when he closed the door after him, -\"What the fuck, Alex\" Tommy hissed locking the door pretending to be mad, but really he was glad. She rolled over on her stomach, -\"Hey, baby\" she grinned closing her book, -\"What are you doing here?\" -\"Studying?\" she said putting one of the books they had gotten as an assignment to read for English class up, -\"Catcher In The Rye\" -\"No, I mean, what are you doing here, you can't be here\" his hand grabbed her petite arm pulling her up on her knees on the bed so she was facing his chest, -\"You need to leave\" his eyes tried to seem threatening, but he was melting into pudding once he saw her honest expression, Alex would never show how desperate she was, never show any weakness, she was the predator, but in this situation she looked more like a lost little girl, with her hand pressed against his chest, focusing on the bruise that was on his neck. It got quite, so quite that Tommy swore he could hear his own heart beat under the palm of her hand, -\"I wanted to see you\" she mumbled, not facing him. Tommy didn't have the want to kick her out, his grip on her arm released and rested on her shoulder as he gathered one of her blond locks between his fingers. Alex always smelled nice, even if she stunk of weed or cigarettes most of the time. Tonight on the other hand she smelled nice and she was covered up, not like at school: her short skirt was still on her, but she had a huge sweater that covered her breasts. Alex backed away from him a little, looking up, cupping his face with both of her hands; they where cold as always, she stroked her thumb over his lips and he would have loved to know her train of thought as why she was doing this –\"How could you still be a virgin\" she whispered so low that he was sure it was more of her venting her thoughts, then an actual question. -\"What's that suppose to mean?\" he asked letting her push her thumb in his mouth, then leaning herself more up more so they where face to face -\"You're handsome, I just figured someone like you would be dating the captain of the cheerleading squad, not getting bruised and tormented weekly, it doesn't seem fair\" Her mouth was so close to his that he felt her breathing out the next words: -\"I always had the biggest crush on you\" Alex's lips pressed themselves into his, at first he didn't know what to do, but as her mouth started moving, her fingers laced themselves in the back of his neck pushing him in, he followed, kissing her slowly. It felt good how soft her lips where and those small moans that escaped her mouth when their tongues played with one and other. Alex pulled Tommy over her, letting him fall between her legs, Tommy disconnected from her lips, arching himself up on his elbows looking down at her flustered face. She was in love with him was all he thought as his fingers removed her hair from the side of her neck and his lips traced kisses up to her ear, she shivered at his touch, gripping onto his shoulders, -\"Tommy\" she moaned, moving her fingers into his short hair, stroking his back with her other hand, while her legs were tied around his hips. The rush of blood made him hard by her moaning alone, he had to move off her, this was not happening, so he buckled up and away from her, which made the small blonde under him confused. -\"We can't do this\" he stated sitting up by the edge of the bed looking over at Alex who was leaning against the headboard of his bed, -\"Because I'm dirty?\" her honesty stung him, he shook his head. She grabbed her backpack that was right next to her, getting up on the other side of the bed, grabbing her shoes off the floor, getting ready to leave, -\"I'm sorry\" he said after her. Alex turned while opening the window, -\"Say hi to your dad from me\" ","Summary":" All this bad blood here, wont you let it dry, it's been cold for years, wont you let it lie?

So, this is a little one-shot I wrote… It's related to an awesome movie I watched a few months ago; Warrior , by Gavin O'Connor, starring Tom Hardy. It was such a good movie, I loved the characters, the story, absolutely everything, and Tom's performance was great! (Yes, I'm obsessed with Tom Hardy) So there it is, this one-shot tells a little bit of a female OC, Abby's life. She's Tommy's friend. There isn't really a storyline, it's just a piece of life, like I like to call it… The regulars know that English isn't my first language. Though, I wrote this one-shot in English only. For this one, like for Afterwards , I tried to write in proper English but I might need a little improvement. So don't hesitate to give me pieces of advice in the reviews! And if you liked it, feel free to leave a kind word, it makes my day! Pour mes lecteurs français (for my French readers): Tout d'abord, sachez que je ne vous abandonne pas! J'ai voulu écrire cette one-shot en anglais uniquement pour certaines raison mais si vous éprouvez l'envie de la lire, en français, n'hésitez pas à me le faire savoir et je ferai une traduction! Bonne lecture et à la prochaine! Until dawn Abbigail finished refilling a client's cup of coffee when she noticed a black dressed figure sitting at a table in the corner of the small dinner she worked in. She looked at the person she guessed to be a man. He was wearing a black sweatshirt, the hood was covering his head. His back was turned to her but she knew exactly who this man was, and it put a smile on her face. Tommy Conlon would come to the restaurant almost every day since he returned to Pittsburgh. Abbigail had known him for a long time, they were good friends in middle school. And she had to admit she had fallen for him at that time. She knew about his family troubles and though it saddened her, she wasn't surprised when she found out he left town. He grew up with an abusive, alcoholic father, in a small and unwelcoming house. One day, they had had enough, and he and his mother left. His brother was supposed to go with them, but he preferred leaving with his girlfriend, it broke Tommy's heart. But a little bit more than a month ago, he came back for whatever reason, and she was actually very happy to serve him a lunch every day. She looked at him again and she knew he hadn't noticed her, she turned that to her advantage and she sneaked up to him quietly. When she was close enough, she playfully pulled the hood off his head to revel his grumpy face. \"Hi Tommy!\" She greeted with joy. He growled back in annoyance and lowered his head to tuck a small bottle of pills back into the pocket of his hoodie. She looked at him once again. He looked very tired. \"Do you want a coffee?\" She asked showing the coffeepot she had in hand. He simply nodded, letting out a faint 'thank you'. She immediately went to grab a cup and walked up to the table to fill it with hot coffee. She then handed it to him with a smile. \"So, what do you want for lunch?\" She then asked. He fell silent for a few seconds, he looked down at his fingers, twiddled them a little and finally replied with that husky voice of him. \"I… I don't have much money, actually…\" \"It's okay.\" She immediately replied. \"It's on me, don't worry…\" She smiled at him warmly. She saw his lips curl ever so slightly as he tried to look elsewhere, as if he was too ashamed to look at her in the eyes. And he was ashamed. She knew him, she knew he hated asking help from people, and especially from her. But he was her closest friend, and she always did anything to help him despite his stubbornness. She patted his strong shoulder with her hand. \"I'm here to help you Tommy…\" She whispered reassuringly. \"Always…\" She insisted. \"Thank you, Abby…\" He whispered back, nodding his head slightly. She tried not to notice the bottle of pills he pulled out of his pocket and walked away quickly to order his lunch from the kitchen. A few minutes later, she returned to his table to serve his plate of food. She would have stayed with him when he ate but she had other clients to attend to. As always, when he was done, he left the restaurant. No thank you, no goodbye… Abby was happy though, for she knew that he had eaten a healthy meal, that he had drunk a warm coffee and that she may have managed to cheer him up a little. And it made her smile. The train ran by for the thousandth time this evening, making the whole building shake and creak with the vibrations. Abby was cleaning off the last formica table of the restaurant when she heard her employer call for her. She turned to the old woman, wiping the sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand. \"I'm gonna close up soon, Abby, you can go home…\" She said with a nod. Abby nodded in turn. As her shift was finished, she headed towards the back room to take her apron off and retrieve her hand bag and jacket. She was about to leave by the front door of the restaurant when the old woman spoke again. \"Do you need a ride home?\" She asked kindly. Abby smiled slightly. The old woman always took care of her and worried about her even though she was just her employer. She always made sure she made it home safe when she would finish her shift late at night. Her and her husband owned the restaurant and they had always been nice to Abby, like a mother and a father, and she thanked them for that. \"No, thank you. I'm gonna walk.\" She replied with a nod. \"Bye!\" She said with a smile and a wave of the hand. Abby pulled up the collar of her winter coat, opened the glass door and then slipped out into the dark, cold night of Pittsburgh. Abby walked hastily on the pavement to keep herself warm. The few yellow streetlights were the only thing that lit her path. Her grip tightened around the handle of her handbag as she felt the cold breeze of the winter. It was almost midnight and she was all alone in the street. The only sound she could hear was the one made by her heels when they hit the pavement. She shivered slightly as she turned into a dark alley. She didn't like walking late at night in the empty streets. Every time she walked through that alley to get back home, she told herself she should have accepted the ride. But every time, when she leaves the restaurant, she declines the proposal. And she regrets it afterwards. She got more comfortable when she came into a lit street. Though, she was still alone, and-she had to admit- she was still a bit scared. She tried to think of something else to occupy her mind. And as her thoughts drifted away, she couldn't help but think about Tommy. He hadn't showed up at the restaurant today. He would usually come every day. Well, he wouldn't always come… But when she didn't see him, it kind of worried her. She snorted lightly at her foolishness. She hadn't seen him for years and it barely bothered her, and now, only one month after he came back, she was worried because she didn't see him for one day… Ridiculous… As her thoughts went on, she started to remember the time she was in middle school with him. They used to be together all the time. He didn't really have friends then, nor did she… So they were very close. They used to walk together to get back home after school. She used to say that they walked together so that they could spend more time together, they would talk and laugh on their way. But the truth was, she was scared to walk alone in the streets, especially during the long and cold nights of winter… And he knew that, that's why he would always walk with her on the way back from school. Back then, she would held tightly on his arm and curl up as close as possible to his body, because she felt safe and warm by his side. It would make him smile sometimes. They would leave school, walk to her house first. And once she left him, he would walk to his own house. Even if it made him make a detour, he loved and cherished these moments. She could remember him smiling when he would see her five-year old sister open the front door with a big toothy smile, run to her and hug her legs tightly because 'she had missed her so much'. Every evening, he would see the joy of the family when it was finally reunited after a long day of work. He would only see that through the opening of a door or a window, but every evening, he would share a little bit of this joy while he waited in the dark of the street for Abby to wave him goodbye. His smile would widen and he would say goodbye to the whole family. But when she would close the front door, he would be alone again. He would walk to his cold, unwelcoming home. He would enter the house by the old wooden front door. And he would hear his drunken father yell at her poor mother while he would walk upstairs to lock himself in the small room he shared with his brother. And in the morning, he would wake up early to walk to her house. She would greet him with a big smile every morning and they would walk to school together. She could still remember that very morning. She had waited for him in front of her house, like she did every day. But he never came… She hadn't seen him for the whole day then, nor did she the day after. And then days turned into weeks, weeks into months and months into years… Then suddenly, she feared he had left again… The freezing breeze intensified a little and a shiver ran through her spine. No, he hadn't left, he couldn't… It's just one day, a little day, come on, you're not his mother, stop worrying for nothing , she tried to convince herself. After all, it wasn't the first time, she hadn't seen him last Monday. He came back the day after, though, that's when he said he had seen his father. It was the first time Tommy talked to his father since he returned to Pittsburgh. She knew it had been hard for him, and she had been there the day after to comfort him, to talk to him. Well, maybe Tommy visited his father again today… Maybe she would have to take care of him again tomorrow; feed him, reassure him and ease his tears… She finally made it back to her house. But came to a halt when she spotted a dark figure sitting on the stairs leading to her front door. She stood still, staring at it for a few minutes. Her heart was beating fiercely, she didn't dare taking another step. The place was lit by a single streetlight, the bulb was blinking and tinkling franticly. She took a deep breath, clutching the handle of her hand bag with her frozen hands. The figure was breathing erratically, blowing little clouds of steam with every exhale. It wasn't moving, just sitting there, at her door. After what seemed like hours, Abby finally decided to take a step forward. The figure was that of a man, a strong man. He must have heard her; he slowly lifted his head to look at her. That's when she recognized him. \"Tommy?\" She asked with a shaky voice. She then walked as fast as possible towards him. \"God, you scared the Hell outta me…\" She sighed. She took a closer look to his face. He was staring at her, though it seemed like he wasn't even looking at her. She spotted the bottle he was holding tightly. She brought her look back to his eyes. It was like a silent plea, a cry for help. She could see the tears that rolled on his cheeks under the yellowish light. She sighed again and climbed the two steps to unlock her front door. She then stood in front of Tommy, crouching a little and holding out her arms to help him stand up. \"C'mere…\" She said, lifting one of his arms to rest it on her shoulders so that he could lean on her. His other hand gripped tightly on the bottle of alcohol. She grabbed it and snatched it from him. \"Come on Tommy, you don't need this crap…\" She whispered, leaving the bottle on the stairs. She didn't remember him being that heavy, but he was, and she felt it as she dragged him inside. She slammed the front door closed and turned a table lamp on when she entered her living room to let him slump down on the couch as she removed her jacket and shoes. She stood still in front of him, staring at his face as he started to cry again, silently. She didn't know whether she should let him sleep in her house or if she should kick him out. Sometimes, he really was a burden, like tonight… He was drunk, he was a wreck… It wasn't the first time she found him on her door step, in this state. That may have happened about ten times since he came back. Every time, she would let him in, she would take care of him and let him sleep in her bed, in her arms . But he would always leave at dawn, without a single word, and when she would wake up, she would be alone, as though he never existed. However, she couldn't bring herself to throw him out. He was her friend, her Tommy, and he needed help… She sighed again and crouched to remove his shoes. \"You've seen your father today, haven't you?\" She asked quietly. He nodded weakly. She stood up again and went to her bedroom. She took off her clothes and put on a loose tank top and a pair of yoga pants she used as pajamas. She returned to the living room to check on Tommy, he was still on the couch, snoring lightly. She then headed to the kitchen to grab a glass and fill it in with water. When she came back into the living room, she tried to convince Tommy to drink the content of the glass. To her surprise, he complied. He drank the whole glass and let it on the coffee table. \"C'mon…\" She said, helping him up and dragging him to her bedroom. That's when she was glad her bedroom was on the same floor. She let him sit on her bed and took off his hoodie and tucked him in the covers like a child. She then climbed in and held him close as he started to fall asleep. He curled up against her, resting his head on her breast and wrapping a possessive arms around her waist. She stared at him for a few more minutes. He really looked like an angel when he was asleep. \"God, Tommy… I'm too kind…\" She sighed, stroking his hair gently. It was just another one of these nights. Tomorrow, she would wake up alone in her bed… But for now, he would be there. Tonight, she would offer him a roof to sleep under, and a warm bed to sleep in. She would be there to comfort him. Because tears would fall from his eyes during the night, she would be there to wipe them off. She would let him get the rest he needed, wrapped in her tight embrace and she would be right there to soothe his tears for the whole night… until dawn. ","Summary":" Hi!

Go on just say it. - Taking Back Sunday, One-eighty by summer It was the way he carried himself: the cold yet smug look on his face when he could throw a punch in the air still dodging your face completely. The way his biceps tensed when he was holding back the punch, his shoulders hunched over, eyes on the level of his balled fists focusing on gunning you down. Four fucking years have you been in love with this angry ball of muscle in the ring with you. He circled you as you where throwing jabs against him, this was a so called sparring session, but it might as well have been called \"anger management training\" because you where so angry at him so it should have been therapeutical getting to beat him up. Not that he´d ever let you anywhere near his face with your fist in the first place. One sharp blow against him and you where on the matt, pinned down under him squirming, still putting up a fight. His breath was hot against your mouth as he just grinned, passing small glances all over your face observing the features: eyes, cheeks then lips. Almost like making a mental picture of what he could have had before you two stopped speaking a month ago. -\"Go on tap out, little girl\" his voice rumbled, the body above you shifted to lay between your legs as he effortlessly strangled your wrists with his grip above your head. -\"Fine!\" you hissed through your teeth, trying to tap out on the matt, but he didnt let your hands move, crushing you instead harder with his weight. It nearly knocked the wind out of your lugs when you felt how heavy his chest was, squeezing your breasts flat. His chest breathing above you moving slowly, he was spent you could see it the sloppy way he was intertwining his fingers with yours this never happened, him never showed any type of sympathy around you. -\"You are gonna have to let me go, Tommy, in order for me to tap out\" you said calmly knowing that creating panic would only worsen your current situation, his eyes didn't leave yours instead he looked at you for an answer, -\"Why you gotta make it so difficult for a guy to be around you?\" You sneered not daring to look away in fear he might put more of his weight on you, it was slightly claustrophobic being so close to a heavy body like Tommy´s. His eyes on watching your face as you licked your lips while he caught onto the nervousness traveling through your body. -\"You like me, that why?\" -\"I´ll tap out okay, just let me up, you win\" you said trying to rise, but to no use. He was stronger and heavier then you, his thumb brushing down your pulse, feeling the sensitive skin there as he ghosted his breathing onto the side of your jawline. Not touching you with his lips, just grazing them over your cheek and clouding you with his scent which was warm with a hint of cologne, soap and that clean musk only he had. The brush of rough skin touched the nape of your neck as he used his hands to lean your head back, biting your bottom lip and letting a rumble of a whisper leave his mouth; -\"Not putting up a fight hm..?\" then placing his mouth on yours. You whimpered shortly when he deepened the kiss, gripping one hand into the back of his damp hair letting the other one bunch onto his wife beater. Feeling up his muscular arms to the fabric of his wife beater before hitting the edges with your fingertips pulling on it when he slid his slippery warm tongue passed the bottom of your lips Tommy´s hands clawed up into your hair, kissing you harder moving his entire body up against yours slipping out a soft groan in the process when you arched your hips up into his, feeling the small bulge of his erection against your cunt. -\"We should stop\" he pulled away breathing heavily against your lips, you nodded trying to get a grip on what the hell just happened and how good it was to get to kiss him. -\"Now get off me\" you hissed, putting your palms against his chest pushing away, when all you really wanted to do was grab the straps of the wifebeater, leap your legs around his torso and drag him into you again. -\"You know what!\" he grabbed both your wrists in a violent tug, holding them up into his chest, piercing you with his grey eyes -\"If you dont behave, I´ll kiss you again, but here instead\" his hand slipped between your legs, pressing two fingers to the center rubbing up. -\"I´ll make you scream my name and beg and plead for me to fuck you, so dont give me that shit, sweetheart, like you didnt enjoy this as much as I did\" he let you go, standing up. The coldness of his body leaving yours gave you a slight shock and you snapped out of the glances and touching that was still lingering in your mind. -\"Like you are God´s gift to women, Tommy Conlon\" you threw after him standing up from the ring and grabbing your towel, feeling the urge between your legs from just looking at him from behind,: the wideness of his back through the wifebeater and his his back muscles tensing when he turned around. -\"No, I´m not\" he smiled, walking passed you to get out of the ring, but stopped by your side and whispering into your ear -\"I could make you shutter though, and maybe quake a little as ?...just like when you whimpered into my mouth..oh so sweetly\" then gave you a wide smile that proved he could always get what he wanted from you.

He placed his keys on the side table by the door, and painfully made his way upstairs, praying that Tess was already asleep. His wife was in fact asleep, her soft blonde hair curling around her face. Her breaths were steady. God, she was beautiful. He remembered how stupidly happy he was when they had first started dating near the end of high school. How badly his hands shook the whole night before he proposed to her. And now, she was here, sleeping in their bed. He loved her so much. And tonight he had let her down. He slipped into the adjoining bathroom and eased the door until it was barely open, hoping that the light wouldn't wake her. In the harsh glare he could see just how badly he looked. He had showered in the locker room after the fight but fresh blood had seeped out of the gash on his chin. His face was bruised, the left eye swollen and a sickening shade of purple. When he took off his shirt he saw that his chest was also mottled. It was disgusting. \"Brendan?\" Crap Tess gasped when she saw him. \"Oh my god Brendan, what-\" \"-Baby.\" They stared at each other for a few moments, pure fear on her face. The flood of guilt that hit brendan was worse than any punch to the gut. He sat down on the edge of the tub and looked up at his wife. \"I'm sorry,\" he whispered. Tess knelt down in front of him. \"I thought you were done with fights.\" her voice was flat, the way it always was when she was trying to control her emotions. She paused. \"How could you?\" Her voice was so faint Brendan barely heard her. She pressed her palms to her eyes and took a deep, measured breath. \"Tess, Tess,\" he soothed. He took her hand but it lay limply in his palm. When she looked up her face told him everything. He had disappointed her. He hurt her in a way he promised them both he never would. He could feel his heart being ripped apart. \"I have to do this.\" She stood up and leaned against the sink. \"No Brendan. No. Don't tell me you have to.\" \"They'll take our house Tess,we can't afford-\" \"Let them take the house! Jesus Christ!\" \"I can't just sit here and do nothing, I need to be useful!\" \"You won't be useful if you get fucking killed!\" The silence was heavy and hung darkly over them. Finally, Tess spoke, quieter this time. \"Brendan you know it could happen. You know it.\" She moved back towards him and sat beside him on the edge of the tub. This time she was the one who reached for his hand. \"I'll be careful,\" he said, rubbing his thumb over the back of her hand. He wouldn't lie to her now by telling her that nothing would happen. He knew better than to promise something like that. \"But it doesn't come down to you being careful,\" she whispered, \"does it?\" They were both quiet for a moment. She looked at him, studying his bruises. Eventually she relented. \"Can we talk about this in the morning?\" \"Yeah, of course.\" She gave his hand a final squeeze and without a further word she padded back into their bedroom. Brendan's head fell into his hands. What has he done? Tess was curled up on her side of the bed, her back towards the middle. Brendan slipped under the covers, and turned to look at her. He wanted to say something, to apologize, to reassure her, he wasn't sure. But her shoulders faced him and he wouldn't know where to start. He turned over, his back facing hers. It was a lonely way to lie in bed with your wife, and he hated it. He lay awake, wondering what to say to her in the morning. Only a minute or so had passed when he felt the other side of the bed shift. Tess's arm slid over his abdomen and she placed her hand over his chest, her hand gripping his shirt. She pressed her body to his, holding him tightly. Brendan turns over and gathers Tess in his arms, pulling her as close to him as he can. She rests her forehead against the place where his neck and shoulder meet. \"Oh Tess,\" he murmured, \"I'm so sorry baby.\" He stroked her hair, trying to put into words how much he hated hurting her. She tilted her head upwards and kissed him gently. When she pulled away Brendan followed her, giving her one more linger kiss. Their lips remained just a fraction away from touching, and he could feel her light breath on his skin. \"I don't think you realize,\" she started, \"just how scared I am of you getting hurt. I can't do this Brendan, I can't raise the girls alone, or-\" she broke off. \"I just can't.\" She paused, shook her head and sighed. \"I'm sorry to have brought this up, I was the one who asked to wait until morning. I understand why you feel like you have to, and I love you for it. But I can't live like this.\" Brendan nodded. \"You should rest, I've kept you up long enough. I promise we'll talk in the morning, okay?\" She curled into him. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too, Tess. More than anything. You and the girls, you're all I want.\" He didn't say things like this often enough. They were always affectionate, he always made sure she knew how much she meant to him, but he didn't say these words as often as he should. \"I love you so, so much Tess.\" She smiled into his collarbone. \"Goodnight Brendan.\" \"Goodnight, baby.\" ","Summary":" Brendan locked the door behind him quietly, not wanting to wake the girls.

Her face is red, her hair pouring out of the messy bun at the top of her head, her hands are balled into fists that she hits her sides with repeatedly, like a toddler lost in a tantrum. \"You are going nowhere but backwards, and I know that's exactly what you want.\" \"Oh, you do?\" he asks in a low voice, but everything in him is screaming different things and the cacophony of conflicting thoughts is muddling his mind. His brain is calling for him to grab that suitcase out of her hand and beg her to reconsider, and at once another order is waved behind his eyes to yell at her until he pops a vein and then kick her out and listen to her screech on the other side of the door like the child he knows she is, the child she accuses him of being. \"I'm sure you know all about immaturity, Caitlin, since you're a shining fucking example right now. Running away from something you can't understand, yeah, really fucking mature!\" He thinks for a moment her heart will give out from anger, but the moment passes and she bounds toward him, her hands raised, ready to fight. She hits his chest and kicks at his legs, and he tries to ignore the stabs of pain, the bruises that will cover his legs in the places she has kicked with her heavy shoes. Tears stream down her face and she coughs and shrieks incoherent things and then caps it off with a slap so forceful that for all his strength propels him back a step. \"You think I don't understand?\" she whispers, her face close to his, deadly calm, and for the first time he is a little apprehensive. \"You think you're some mystery to me? You are damaged, Tommy. Damaged. You're no good to anybody because you love that damage, you are nothing without it, and you won't let anybody forget it, especially not me and especially not yourself!\" \"That is bullshit!\" he starts to protest but she silences him with a glare he has seen many times, but never aimed at him, and he doesn't even know how they got here. \"No, it isn't,\" she says, and she takes a step back, her lips white around the edges, her eyes wild and foreign now. \"Do you want to know what is? All that fucking anger, that is bullshit. And it's bullshit that you won't let it cool down because you don't want to let it go. Not even for me. I've been waiting for a miracle here, Tommy. Jesus, you getting your shit together? That's gonna take more than a miracle! I understand that now, and that's why I'm leaving.\" She turns her back on him and picks up her suitcase, opening the door to his apartment. The fire in him melts away for just a second when he realizes my God, she's actually leaving . \"Caitlin,\" he calls. He is expecting a yell over her shoulder, or a last glance, or an obscenity whispered under her breath, or something, anything, but she doesn't even look back to acknowledge him. Then the fire comes back, roaring inside his chest, and he shouts, \"Yeah, good riddance! Find some pansy fucker that will cry about his feelings like you want, I don't know why you bothered with me in the first fucking place!\" and he slams the door after her and breaks everything in the apartment and drinks until he blacks out. And when he wakes up in the morning, she's still gone. . \"Cate, what are you doing?\" he asks patiently, stepping into the living room to see her rearranging herself under a blanket on the couch, rolled into a tiny ball of irrepressible discontent. She blatantly ignores him, her eyes screwed shut, her face screaming, \"Go away,\" so she doesn't have to, but he does some ignoring too, sitting on the other side of the couch at her feet leaning over her until she cracks an eye open and sees him. Immediately, she kicks his chest, not rough enough to inflict pain, but with enough force to push him back to the other side. It's progress, he decides. She never holds back when she really wants to hurt him. \"Come on, let's go to bed,\" he tells her. She shakes her head. \"I'm good here, thanks.\" The stiff politeness in her voice makes him frown. She sounds like a stranger, detached and disconnected. She curls up tighter, until her chin rests on her knees. \"Look, I'm sorry,\" he says. \"You don't even know what you're apologizing for,\" she deadpans. He wants to hold on to that patience he told himself he wouldn't let go of when he left his room but he can feel it slipping away despite his viselike grip. \"Then tell me what I'm apologizing for, Caitlin, Jesus Christ!\" \"I won't sleep in the same bed as you when your mind is on another plane of existence, okay?\" She pokes her head out of her cocoon and glares at him. \"You are not here, Tommy. You are never here. You are somewhere far away. I want you to be here with me.\" \"I am here with you,\" he says, and he takes her hand and presses it to his chest, so small and tiny compared to his bulk. \"I am right here, dammit. Where else would I be, but here with you?\" She looks at him, the glare in her face but not her eyes, and she doesn't move her hand from his chest, which he thinks is good, but then she sits up and takes his face in both her hands, searching, and he doesn't know what for. He wants her to see his confusion, but his anger breaks through and he turns his face away from her. \"What do you want my mind there for anyway?\" he asks bitterly. \"We're going to sleep, not school, for fuck's sake.\" Something passes over her face, like she was wearing a mask this whole time, feigning anger. Something like disappointment, and sadness, overwhelming sadness, and she lowers her gaze and takes her hands away from his face. \"Okay, Tommy,\" she says, defeated in a way he has never seen her. \"Okay.\" He goes back to bed to wait for her but she doesn't come back in until day breaks and the sky is lighting up, and she doesn't touch him or speak, and neither of them sleep a wink. . She presses her face to her pillow and takes a deep breath, and he watches her with a smile on his face that he isn't aware of until she places a hand over it. \"I have a thing about sleeping on other people's pillows, you know,\" she tells him. \"Oh, really?\" he says, amused. \"OCD or something? Nutcase.\" \"No, really,\" she persists. \"I can't sleep on any pillow but my own. It's the stupidest thing, something about the way it smells like me. Like home.\" \"What does home smell like?\" he asks. \"Like the ocean, and incense, because my brother was such a hippie,\" she whispers, and suddenly her eyes become sad, downcast. Her hand slides off his face. \"I was raised by him, and we moved around a lot, basically followed whatever job he could get. But he stuck to the coasts, east, west, it didn't matter to him, as long as there was sun and surf, he could care less.\" \"Sounds better than Pittsburgh,\" he observes. \"Why did you come here?\" Her eyes flashed up to his, unreadable. \"He died here, many years ago. And it turns out that he was the only thing that kept up my spirit of adventure because as soon as he was in the ground, the last thing on my mind all of a sudden was to move again. So I stayed.\" He wants to lighten up the mood so he says, \"This makes for great pillow talk, yeah,\" and her eyes soften but she doesn't smile and he sort of slumps. \"Tell me about your brother,\" she says. He shrugs, rolling onto his back. He thinks he hears her sigh, and he thinks it sounds tired. \"Nothing to tell,\" he says. \"I saw that fight on Youtube,\" she says, and his heart plummets, because God knows he's tried to keep that from her. \"The Sparta fight. The final.\" \"Lotta people did,\" he tries to brush it away but it just sits there until he turns back on his side and says, \"We don't talk all that much, Cate, that's all.\" She doesn't understand, he knows she doesn't. There is no way she can speak about her brother with such love and he can't even stand to bring his up. \"Tommy, how will I get you if you don't let me in?\" she asks. He tries to roll over again but she grabs his arm and steadies him. His mood is shot to hell now; all he can see are broken images of the fight, all he can feel is the blinding pain from his shoulder, all he can hear is Brandon telling him, \"I love you. I love you, Tommy.\" And all he knows is a sinking disappointment, in himself for never reaching toward Brandon, for letting that olive branch he set out that day in the fight to wither, forgotten, until Brandon's attempts became far and few between. And in Brandon, for not trying hard enough. She wants to listen, she wants to understand, but how can she, when he himself doesn't understand? \"We were kids together but that's it,\" he says. He traces shapes on the ceiling with his eyes as he feels hers on him. \"It was a long time ago. And then me and my mom moved, and he stayed with Pop. And some girl.\" \"A girl?\" \"He's married to her now. They have two daughters.\" \"What are their names?\" For some reason, one of the names escapes him. One is named Emily, he knows that, but the youngest... he wracks his brain but he can't remember, even as her face swims in his mind. He can't explain why he feels so guilty all of a sudden, so guilty that it's like a weight on his chest that won't let up. \"Drop it, Caitlin, okay?\" he whispers, closing his eyes. \"Not tonight.\" Her irritation at being brushed off is only momentary. She presses his head to her chest and runs her fingers through his hair, and she says, \"Go to sleep, Tommy.\" He almost does, until something occurs to him. \"You don't sleep on other people's pillows?\" \"Yeah. Something about the scent.\" \"You've been sleeping on mine for a while, Cate.\" She kisses his head and goes back to brushing his hair, and the motion is so rhythmic and soothing that he's asleep in moments, and he might have imagined that she replied, \"Maybe it's because you feel like home.\" But he doesn't think that he did. . \"...will probably be back in half an hour, but I'll tell him you called,\" she's saying when he enters the apartment, stinking to high heaven and wiping his face with the towel around his neck. He collapses onto the couch and looks at her expectantly as she places the phone back into its cradle. \"Who was that?\" he asks just as she casually says, \"How was the run?\" \"Fine,\" he mutters, narrowing his eyes at her suspiciously. \"Who was that?\" She shifts around for a moment, then her green eyes snap up to meet his and she says, \"Your father.\" He tenses but places the towel over his face and leans his head back so she won't see him. \"Oh.\" He feels her sit beside him, and her hand clasps his tightly. He presses his lips together when she removes the towel and keeps his eyes on the ceiling. \"Are you gonna call him?\" she asks. \"Maybe,\" he tells her to throw her off the scent of secrets she doesn't know yet, but it doesn't help because she leans toward him, one arm braced on his other side to keep her up, and he has no choice but to look at her. \"You stink,\" she observes. \"I know,\" he mutters. \"Are you not speaking with your father?\" she says next. The fire inside him roars at the mention of Paddy coming out of her mouth. Is nothing sacred anymore? Can he not enjoy her company without his memory soiling it for him? \"Cate, I stink,\" he says lightly, taking both her arms and crossing them over her chest. He presses her slightly into the sofa, and she sinks in between two cushions, but where her eyes would be alight with laughter at this, there is only a soft confusion contorting her mouth into a frown. \"Well, he said to call when you had the time,\" she says, shrugging his hands off her. Her eyes are inquisitive. He gives her a small kiss as he pulls himself off the couch and heads for the shower. \"Okay, I got it,\" he says, waving the matter away with a casual flick of his wrist. Her eyes burn twin holes in the back of his head as he walks away from her. . \"Favorite color?\" He considers for a moment. \"Probably red.\" \"Why?\" He raises an eyebrow at her across the table. \"Do I need a reason?\" \"Of course,\" she says. \"Everything needs a reason, Tommy.\" He nods slowly, his eyes roving around the restaurant, deliberating. \"I don't know. It's versatile, I guess.\" \"Versatile?\" she repeats, holding back a laugh. \"Okay, what? How can a color be versatile?\" \"Hey, you asked,\" he says, pointing a finger at her, and the laugh bursts out of her mouth. He watches her, caught in a half laugh himself. \"Okay, favorite childhood memory.\" He nods again and looks around to buy him some time, but his grip on his fork has tightened and he sees her eyes dart to it and then back to his face carefully. \"Uh,\" he begins, then he clears his throat. \"Um.\" Dammit , he thinks, say something . Her eyes narrow ever so slightly, and she tilts her head to one side, her dark curls cascading over her shoulder as she does. The longer the silence stretches, the less easily he'll be able to maneuver out of this, he knows, so he quickly says the first thing that comes to mind. \"It's stupid, but I got nothing else.\" At her encouraging smile, he says, \"It was my birthday a long time ago, I was a teenager, and my mom and I, we went to this travelling carnival thing. We didn't do that kind of stuff usually, so it was a change, and, um, that's it.\" He lowers his gaze, his mother's face swimming in his mind's eye, but blurred with time. He realizes that he has forgotten important things about her, like the exact shape of her eyes, or the way she always wore her hair, or the length of her fingers. He wonders if one day he will try to remember her and won't be able to and it is so sobering a thought that he puts the fork down and looks around blankly. A pressure on his hand makes him search for the source, and he finds her hand over his, small but strong and reassuring, and when he looks at her face, he finds eyes that stare directly into his. \"That's not stupid,\" she says. \"It's a nice memory.\" He manages a smile, and she smiles back, and he picks up his fork and they eat in a comfortable silence that she breaks after a while to suggest they share dessert. . At the intersection of two quiet suburban streets, he presses his hands on his knees and catches his breath. The sun is just breaking over the horizon, he can hear a bird or two gingerly waking and chirping a short, soft song. He gives himself a moment to breathe before he starts running again, faster and faster, checking his watch as he does. She is usually out at this time, almost always is, just as he comes to the end of his morning run, smoking a cigarette by the entrance into her ground level apartment as she watches the sunrise. At first it was a thing to do because he was bored, to jog past her and see her leaning against her front door, as still as a statue, save for the cigarette, burning bright in the predawn light, thin tendrils of smoke reaching up as high as they could go until fading into nonexistence. In the quiet of the morning, he would rush past her and imagine an entire story about her, that maybe she was a mother and the only time she had to herself to smoke was just then, or maybe she had gotten into a fight with her boyfriend and was cooling off outside. He invented a new story every day, kept his mind on it as he pushed his body through further distances and his legs turned into lead bars and he wanted nothing more than to stop but didn't. Then it became an almost habit, and when she got used to seeing him every morning, she would wave. Today, she waves, and when he slows down to catch his breath, she puts out the cigarette and walks up to him, and he feels a little like he's being approached by a celebrity, someone he sees all the time but has never met. \"I see you a lot,\" she observes, her eyes flashing in the darkness as they take him in. \"I run in the morning,\" he explains. She has a nice face, something he has never noticed because of the distance and the dark. \"I smoke in the morning,\" she replies. \"Can't you smoke when the sun comes up?\" he asks despite himself. She gives him a peculiar look. \"No. Then I would smoke all the time. Before sunrise, that's my rule. And then I'm just limited to one or two a day.\" He nods, understanding. A thousand little stories are crossed out of his head. \"That's smart.\" \"Not as smart as quitting altogether would be,\" she mutters. \"What's your name?\" \"Tommy,\" he tells her. She puts her hand out to shake. It's swallowed up in his. \"I'm Caitlin.\" Her eyes meet his, and in the light of the rising sun, he sees that they're green, like freshly cut grass. He thinks about letting go of her hand, but he can't seem to be able to and her eyes bore into his until he drops them both, looking east, to the smudge of orange in the horizon. \"Hi,\" he says finally. He catches her gaze again, and he sees that a smile is tugging on the corners of her lips, small and barely perceptible, but there, and her eyes get smaller as the smile gets more noticeable, and it's a very pretty thing to see in such a bland part of town. He thinks up a new story and wonders if he should bother trying to make it happen. He's been wrong about the others. But maybe he'll be right about this. She says, \"Hi.\" fin ","Summary":" backwards \"Because you're a child!\" she screams.

I´ve leaned with time to keep them there ever since my father \"accidentally\" flushed them in the toilet, he´s never understood my sickness and being an alcoholic he didn't really have much patience to understand either. The floor was cold under my feet once I stepped into the kitchen and I saw a shadow from the corner of my eye of sitting at the end of the kitchen table. At first I suspected it being my father, since I´ve many times caught him his drunken state sitting by the table at night crying over my mother and God knows what. Although it wasn't him, because this person´s back was stronger looking so I tip toed around the corner, feeling at the frame of the door to grab a broom that was resting by the entrance, in our neighborhood you could never be too careful. As turned the corner walking over slowly the shadow turned around and I saw a pair of grey eyes. This had to be a dream, the lack of medication was playing tricks on me so I put the broom down shaking my head. -\"Jesus Christ\" I huffed going for the cupboard. -\"I really need to call my fucking doctor\" I said taking out two pills from the orange container into my hand, filling up a glass of water -\"Stupid pills\" I muttered chucking them down and swallowing them down with the water. Then I took a deep breathe closing my eyes and turned around to still see the person sitting there, -\"Great, its finally here, I´m seeing dead people\" The person chuckled a chuckle I knew all too well, something that hurt my heart so much I could feel the lump growing in my throat. -\"That´s nice\" I shook my head, crossing my arms, -\"Nice seeing you again, dead Tommy Conlon\" -\"Whatever they are giving you, kid, you should have some more, you´re hilarious\" he commented, standing up, filling the room with his body frame, all I wanted to do was just hug him, but I knew I´d be hugging loose air. -\"I talk to dead people, safe to say I´m done being funny\" I said walking passed him, feeling his grip around my wrist something I had never felt before, it seemed so real like it really where his hands on my skin. My eyes watered up and stung as I glanced up at him, seeing his grey eyes shining down at me and his smile forming brightly. -\"Don´t do this\" I whispered, -\"I´m not going back\" -\"Where too, kid?\" he said lightly as the tears flooded my eyes and fell down my cheeks, staining the skin and rolling around my chin. His other hand cupped my cheek and his thumb caught the tears wiping them away. I leaned into the touch, closing my eyes and giving out a weak whimper. -\"You are not real\" my bottom lip quivered as I bit it to stop myself from crying harder, but I knew it was there I could sense it in the bottom of my throat a strong cry just waiting to be released. -\"Missed me then?\" he said moving the hand that was grasping my wrist up my arm stroking it, I shook my head, -\"They told me not to listen to you, I promised I wouldn't listen to you\" I said with my eyes still closed, -\"You are not real, you are not real\" I repeated as the weak whimper turned into full sobbing by the last sentence. -\"Open you´re eyes\" he mused, letting the hand he was resting around my face fall down on my shoulder. I opened my eyes like he ordered and saw myself in the reflection of his eyes like the moon in his eyes if you may. -\"I wont make you\" he said kissing my forehead and I looked down at his chest seeing the splatter of blood spreading over his white wife beater. Putting my hands over my mouth I cried, trying to muffle the small cries, his hand rubbed at the cuts on my wrists as I kept on trying to stop myself from crying to no avail. -\"It wont be long now\" he commented leading my hand to fall on his sturdy chest, it felt real even the blood on my hands which staining my fingertips. I looked at him through teary eyes watching him breathing heavily and closing his eyes. -\"I´m sorry\" I cried lowly. -\"Dont cry, it´s okay, kid\" he sullied, opening his eyes. And then the touch felt empty and he was gone. I looked at my hands and the blood was gone too.

I stumbled across this movie and was so blown away by it that I proceeded to watch it again... and again... and again. It's raw, heartfelt, and just amazing, not to mention I'll love practically anything with Tom Hardy in it. So here we are. R&R; if you enjoy, I'm open to questions and would love to hear any comments, suggestions, or concerns you may have :) Disclaimer: None of the characters in this story except my OC are licensed to me and belong to the wonderful screenwriters and producers of this movie. Title is the song by The Nationals, which is played at the end of the film. Chapter title pulled from The Anthem by Good Charlotte. 1. It's a Good Life, That's What I'm Told Two years. He knew it could be worse, that there have been sentences up to four or five, hell, he knew that in some cases desertion was punishable by death. He could've walked straight out of that cage into a firing squad instead of the hospital. And in the long run, it wouldn't be so bad. Not really. One year two times over, one month twenty-four times over. The time would pass however he broke it down – that really wasn't an issue. But just… fuck. Those were two years of his life, dammit, just about to be flushed down the goddamn drain like… what? Like nothing ever happened? Like he hadn't fought for his country, hadn't held Manny in his arms as he died with his wife's name on his lips, hadn't seen his entire unit blown to bits by the same fucking country they were fighting for? Wasn't it enough? They want to talk about deserting his unit, huh? By the time the last bomb hit, he had no unit. Jesus. Two years. Tommy fell back in passenger seat of the old Ford, breathing heavily as they drove away from the prison. One night in a holding cell, it hadn't been all that rough. Somehow Brendan managed to buy him more time, a little bit of reprieve before he was tossed on his ass into bars. He stole glances at his brother as they drove. Brendan looked… relaxed, almost. Peaceful. With one arm on the wheel and the other resting casually on the console between them, he appeared more at ease around Tommy than he had in the last month. Things between them were… Well, he wasn't gonna lie and say they've been good, because they haven't, really. Far from it, in fact. But the brothers had fallen into a companionable silence, and he thought maybe it could be a start. Maybe, over some time, they'd patch things up between them. He nearly snorted at the thought. Over some time indeed. Two years. \"That it, huh?\" Tommy mused, schooling his voice into impassiveness, like it didn't really matter. Like he wasn't about to lose two years of his life, of his training, of his career to a fucking cell. Brendan glanced at him sideways in the rearview mirror, and he couldn't quite pick apart the look crossing his face. \"That's it?\" he echoed incredulously. \"Well, what were you expecting? Jesus, to even give you two years is…\" He ran a hand through his hair, suddenly looking very, very tired and though he probably shouldn't have been, Tommy was surprised at how much he seemed to care. \"The balls of those guys, I can't believe it,\" Brendan continued, shaking his head. \"I mean, God Tommy, it was friendly fire for Christ's sake. PTSD, you know. You hear about that stuff all the time. And then you went and saved those kids, to top it off.\" A small, disbelieving laugh made its way out of Brendan's mouth. \"How the hell…\" he muttered, shaking his head again. Raising his free hand from its place on the console, he clapped Tommy on the shoulder awkwardly. \"Ripped the door off a goddamn tank, man, I'm proud of you.\" He jerked away from Brendan's touch, dragging his eyes away so he didn't have to see the hurt flicker in his brother's eyes. \"'At's what Pop said, too, you know. 'At's what everyone's been saying. Running 'round all high and mighty and telling me that they're proud of me, that they're sorry ,\" he drawled, staring resolutely out the window, jaw clenched. The morning sun beat down on his face but he didn't feel it, didn't care. \"\"That stuff\", huh?\" Tommy laughed bitterly, shaking his head. \"What the fuck would you know about PTSD?\" he spat, lips twisting cruelly. He knew the words were biting, knew they'd hurt Brendan but it felt like a dam had been opened and now everything was flooding out. Try as he might, he couldn't stop. \"What, you think I'm all fucked up now, huh?\" Brendan's breaths were coming in shallow breaths and he was gritting his teeth and God, why couldn't he just shut up? \"Got in a cage and took a few swings at my own brother, must be something wrong with me, huh?\" He flexed his shoulder, the joint popping obscenely as it squeezed out of its socket. It was sickening. The sound echoed through the car and he didn't have to look to see guilt flood the lines of Brendan's weary face. The apology was there but Tommy didn't want to hear it. He'd heard it over and over again, in the cage, with the paramedics, lying in that hospital bed high as a kite off the morphine drip in his arm. He'd heard his Pop apologize too, over and over as the old man shuffled around pathetically, muttering how sorry he was in between promises to getting back to the AA or something. Hell, he'd heard the damn people that pass him on the streets apologize, his \"oh-so-adoring fans\". They walked around with their false sympathy and couldn't seem to stop telling him how sorry they all were, like they knew him or something. Bullshit. Tommy was done with fucking apologies. He chuckled darkly and there wasn't anything funny, the sound pulled out of him with a sneer. \"I meant what I said before, you got some serious stones.\" By the time Tommy chanced a look over, Brendan's face looked the same as always, though both his hands clenched tightly around the wheel. They pulled into Brendan's driveway, still not saying a word. Tommy took advantage of the silence to get a good look at Brendan's house, trying to get a picture of the life his brother had. A typical suburban flat, complete with a wide, grassy lawn and well-groomed garden. Perfect for the kind of guy with a wife, two kids, and a minivan. Which was… exactly the kind of guy his brother was. He swallowed the bitterness rising inside him. Yeah, Brendan got what he wanted when he stayed. \"'Ey man, you gonna just sit there or you gonna come in?\" Brendan asked, forcing a small smile as he yanked the passenger door open, probably wondering what the hell was taking him so long. Tommy looked up, eyes unfocused for a minute before he swallowed, nodding. \"Yeah. I – yeah.\" Brendan was making an effort, and damned if he was gonna be the one to throw it all to shit. Not today, anyways. \"You opening the door for me like I'm some chick now?\" he asked, reaching over to punch his brother's shoulder playfully. Brendan grinned and it was visible how a little tension eased out of him. Things were still rocky, tentative, and awkward between the two, but it was a start. \"Yeah, well, you were takin' so long you I thought maybe you'd turned into one,\" he shot back, dodging the swipe his way at the comment. \"C'mon, let's get you some food.\" He paused at the door, key in hand as he waited for Tommy to catch up. \"You hungry?\" Right on cue, Tommy's stomach growled, eliciting a sharp bark of laughter from the both of them. \"Damn right I am.\" He shuddered, thinking of the food from the previous night. \"Jail's got worse food than the Corps and that's sayin' something.\" They share a laugh as Tess opened the door like some sort of psychic, although it probably wasn't hard to guess they were home from the racket they were making outside. \"You guys gonna come in or what?\" she asked, sounding so much like her husband that Tommy wanted to laugh. Brendan grinned sheepishly, pocketing his keys as he leaned in for a quick peck. Tommy averted his eyes and told himself there wasn't a clench in his chest at the sight of the happy couple, that there wasn't a small, tiny piece of him that wanted for himself even a fraction of what Brendan and his wife had. Tess smiled at him warmly, beckoning him inside. \"Hey Tommy, it's good to see you.\" Her tone actually sounded genuine, and for all its worth, he thought she was definitely a better actress than Brendan. \"Come on in, the girls can't wait to meet you, and there's pancakes if you're hungry.\" And shit, he had to give her props for trying. Because here he was, the man who landed a good beating on her husband the last time she saw him, and in turn had his shoulder dislocated by the same man. And here she was, smiling and telling him to come in, to come meet their daughters, like she wanted him to be a part of their family too. He'd like that, maybe. Someday. The dynamic of Brendan's house was unlike anything Tommy had ever seen. Well, 'course it's not, he thought wryly. Like there could ever be any sort of family dynamic in Paddy Conlon's household. But as soon as he stepped foot into that house, the mood was just so domestic and homey and the feel sent his mind reeling. What he wouldn't have given for that as a child. He caught Brendan's eye across the foyer as he slid his shoes off. \"Nice place,\" he remarked quietly. And he didn't say anything about how it was the place he left Tommy and Ma for, he didn't mention that while he was off with Tess, Ma was coughing up blood and Tommy was rubbing her down with holy water because there just wasn't money to pay for insurance. He didn't have to, and for the first time, he didn't want to either, either. It was just a nice place. Brendan nodded his thanks, mouth lifting into a tentative half smile. He understood. \"Girls!\" called Tess, breaking their moment of silence. \"Come down and meet your Uncle Tommy!\" There was a pause, and then a flurry of little footsteps down the stairs and excited shouts and giggles. \"He's here, he's here!\" little voices exclaimed joyfully, nearly stopping Tommy in his tracks. He's… what? Brendan, Tess, they told the girls about him? And good things, too, judging from the excitement their small voices held. His head whipped around to look at his brother but Brendan studiously avoided his gaze. Tommy didn't have time to even process that because the next minute, two blurs of blonde pig-tails came hurtling down the stairs. The older girl, at least seven or eight, slid to a stop expertly, beaming up at him. The littler one struggled however, skidding as she tried to stop. She stumbled forward, right into Tommy. He reached down to steady her, suddenly very aware of the large lump forming in his throat. No words would pass through, but thankfully the oldest girl had enough of them. \"Hi Uncle Tommy!\" she cried, bouncing on her toes excitedly. \"I'm Emily.\" He smiled back at her almost unthinkingly, swallowing down the lump in his throat at the words 'Uncle Tommy'. \"Hi, Emily,\" he replied softly, eyes impossibly soft. \"It's real good to meet you.\" And it was. God, it was. He looked down to the little girl at his feet. \"And how about you? What's your name?\" She blinked up at him, eyes large and glassy. \"Rosie,\" she whispered, entirely too solemn for a girl around age five. \"My – my name is Rosie.\" The little thing was blushing shyly and stuttering over her words as she tried to hide her face in his pant leg and Tommy thought it was just about the cutest thing he'd ever seen. \"You're big,\" she whispered, almost as an afterthought as she stared up at him with those giant eyes. He stared down at her for a second, astonished, before a laugh bubbled forth from his lips. Of all the things… Brendan and Tess stood in the kitchen, Tess with her hand over her mouth as she watched the scene unfold and Brendan blinking rapidly. He hadn't heard his brother laugh, truly laugh like that in years . \"Well,\" Tommy started, crouching down beside her with a grin. \"How about now? See, I'm not so big.\" Rosie shook her head, taking a hesitant step forward before wrapping her tiny arms around his neck and pressing her face into his shoulder. Tommy froze at first, then slowly pulled his arms around his niece, holding her to him. If Tess began to tear up in the kitchen, nobody said a word. \"Tag! Uncle Tommy, you're it!\" yelled Emily as she darted away from him. Rosie refused to let go of his leg, making it a fair challenge to waddle after her older sister. After breakfast, the girls had kidnapped him, dragging him outside to play. Tommy looked down at Brendan's youngest clinging to his leg like a lifeline. \"Hey, Rosie,\" he prompted softly, \"don't you wanna go get your sister?\" She shrugged bashfully and he took that as an alright answer. Reaching down, he pried her little hands from around her leg and enclosed one with his, leading her over to where Emily gleefully skipped about, shouting \"Bet you can't catch me!\" He squeezed Rosie's hand, grinning. \"Come on. Let's go get her.\" All of a sudden, the little girl burst out in a grin, beaming up at him as she broke into a run, dragging him by the arm to chase after her sister. \"Whoaaaa!\" he exclaimed, laughing. \"Where'd all that energy come from?\" Rosie just giggled as she ran, nearly tripping over herself. Emily squealed as they neared her, dancing away. Tommy just leaned down, picked up Rosie, and placed her on his shoulders, chasing after the kid and grabbing her in a bear hug as she shrieked. Rosie was ecstatic. \"Got you, Em, got you! Me an' Uncle Tommy got you!\" She was smiling so widely as she pushed her wild hair from her face, shouting gleefully. It was the most he'd heard her speak since he got there. He just grinned back at her, not quite trusting himself to form words, and brushed her hair back, clumsily redoing her pigtails. After a couple rounds of tag, hide-and-seek, and later, hide-and-seek tag, the girls quieted down and Tommy had somehow been roped into swing duty, oblivious to Brendan and Tess watching through the porch screen. \"He's good with them,\" she remarked, watching their daughters shout and giggle as Tommy takes turns pushing them. Brendan swallowed thickly, nodding. He wasn't sure what to expect when he took Tommy home with him. Tess was fully on board with it and come on, it's not like he was about to leave his own brother in jail, no matter how bad things got between them. But he never, never expected this, for his brother to turn into this fun uncle and immediately become wrapped around his little girls' fingers. Watching the man out there, you'd never be able to guess he'd been abused as a child, had been to war, was awaiting a prison sentence. Tommy looked… happy. \"Yeah. He really is.\" Tommy and the kids stayed outside playing the whole morning. He didn't notice how much time had gone by until he saw Tess on the porch, calling them in for lunch.[Chapter 2] A/N: New chapter!

Title is from Wasted Time by Vance Joy (who is amazingly talented and an absolute angel). 2. Why Do You Go Wasting Your Time on Me? Tommy woke to incessant banging on his door and only had time to mutter a sleepy \"Wha'thefuck?\" before two little menaces in footed pajamas burst through the doorframe and proceeded to knock the breath out of him as they jumped onto his unsuspecting form. He could only stare as the girls flopped around, giggling and shrieking while he blinked the sleep from his eyes. Emily shouted gleefully as she bounced on the mattress and he winced at the creak of the springs, hiding an amused grin as Tess' yell echoed through the house, calling for the kids to settle down and let their Uncle Tommy rest. Rosie knelt down beside him, eyes wide as she sobered immediately. \"Uncle Tommy?\" A little hand reached out to poke his cheek. \"Aren't you going to get up and play with us?\" she whispered. And well, fuck, as much as he would have liked to just roll over and go back to sleep, it seemed Brendan's youngest had already wrapped him around her finger and he found it quite impossible say no to her wide, pleading eyes. The corners of his lips turned up as he nodded. \"Sure, I'll play with you kiddos in a second.\" Emily shouted her excitement, flopping onto his chest. Hiding a smirk, he flipped them over and ran his hands down her side, tickling the girl mercilessly. \"Uncle Tommy! Uncle Tommy, st-stop!\" She dissolved into giggles, squirming as she tried to escape him. Rosie laughed delightedly, bouncing on her knees beside them. Feeling pity at long last, he released Emily, who quickly rolled away to catch her breath. Turning to the younger girl with a glint in his eye, Tommy genuinely laughed as she quickly bounced off the bed, pausing a safe distance away to eye him warily. \"Oh, a'right,\" he sighed dramatically. \"S'pose you're safe, Rosie.\" The child in question grinned in triumph, immediately scampering back over for a hug. Tommy grunted in surprise as the kid flung herself practically on top of him. A small chuckle escaped him and he patted her on the back awkwardly. \"Right, run along now, I'll be down in a minute. Your mom's prolly got breakfast all ready for you.\" The children waved at him as they ran back down the hall, their laughter bouncing off the walls. Tommy sighed, running a hand through his messy hair as he propped himself up on his elbows. Since when had he grown so… soft? Jesus, he felt like he was turning into a woman or something. Yet in all seriousness, it bothered him far less than it probably should have. Shaking his head, he pushed himself out of bed and to the bathroom to brush his teeth. An abrupt throat clear made him freeze as Brendan materialized in the doorway. He narrowed his eyes, glaring at the other man. \"They really like you,\" his brother remarked quietly, leaning against the doorframe. Tommy stiffened, jerking his head in a curt nod. \"They – Rosie… you're good with her,\" Brendan continued, looking at him intensely. \"She's a quiet one; doesn't take to many people.\" Tommy shrugged. Yeah well, neither do I . \"She's a good kid,\" he replied gruffly, masking the small burst of pride blooming in his chest and pushing past his brother through the threshold. He could feel Brendan's gaze on his back but ignored it, throwing a shirt and gym shorts on over his boxers before heading downstairs. Tommy stuck with the girls the whole day playing, running around and reading stories and building Legos. So he might've drawn the line at playing princesses and possibly moved away faster than he'd care to admit when they chased after him with tiaras and feather boas and Tess' makeup (Brendan helped them corner him in, the asshole, and an extremely, extremely emasculating picture had come out of the whole ordeal, one that no one would ever see lest they'd like to be beaten to a pulp). And maybe he'd quickly handed them over to Brendan when it came time for homework help, but they came running back as soon as they were finished. It was… nice, for lack of a better word. He and Brendan had been civil, he didn't have to deal with Pop, Tess was nothing but welcoming, and the girls were absolutely the greatest kids. As far out of his element he felt, it was nice. Extremely domestic, but nonetheless pleasant. Home life was something he could get used to… And he pushed that thought out of his mind as soon as it appeared, ignoring the tiny clench in his chest at the thought of his inevitable life alone. He couldn't stay in his brother's guest room forever, and after that… Well, Tommy held no illusions of a happily ever after. But for now, things were okay. Even if he was seconds from slugging his brother across the face. Brendan had been fidgety all through dinner, casting furtive glances at Tommy. He opened his mouth several times as if he wanted to say something but closed it without a word. Tommy ignored it the first few times but when his brother continued to act strangely the whole meal, he quickly became irritated. As they were clearing up the dishes – Tommy always helped Tess wash up – Brendan cornered him in the kitchen. Tess made herself scarce, clearly recognizing a need for privacy, which only served to further annoy him. \"A'right, whadd'ya want?\" Tommy snapped, glaring at the other man. Brendan blinked at him owlishly and Tommy rolled his eyes. \"Aw come on, don't gimme that. You look like you're about to shit yourself, just spit it out.\" The man opened his mouth and – so God help him – closed it again. Tommy closed his eyes, closing his hands into fists at his sides as he prayed for patience. Brendan ran a hand through his hair, clearly nervous about whatever the hell this was. \"I – come take a drive with me,\" he said finally, pushing away from the counter and starting out the door. Staring at his brother's retreating back, Tommy sighed and followed. They took Brendan's new car this time, a sleek black Audi that Tommy hated immediately. Money to pay off your mortgage and support your family, my ass , he thought. You don't get a car like that without money and he knew all too well where the money came from. Nevertheless, he hopped in the passenger seat without a word and they drove off. The first few miles were pure silence; the tension saturating the expensive interior almost palpable. \"Brendan,\" Tommy drawled, rolling his eyes. Honestly. His brother nodded, finally. \"I, um, I've got a friend,\" he started. Tommy snorted. Of course the man had friends. Especially now; everyone seemed to want to be friends with the great Brendan Conlon. Tommy just looked at him expectantly. \"Right, yeah. I've got a friend that's – well, that used to be a lawyer. A real good one, too.\" The words slammed him like a blow to the head. This was what Brendan wanted to talk about? Since his brother had picked him up from the prison, they'd been treading on eggshells around his inevitable two years. Because that's what it was. Inevitable. He stared at Brendan. \"You – you can get me a hearing.\" Brendan sucked in a breath. \"I don't – I… this was what I wanted to talk to you about. I haven't even called her yet – is this something you want to do?' Was this something he wanted to do? Tommy closed his eyes, shaking his head in disbelief. \"Is this something I want to do?\" He nearly laughed. \"Brendan, I – no, I wanna spend the next two years locked up in a fucking cell. Yeah , you asshole, this \"getting my ass outta sentencing\" is something I want to do. If you can get them to give me a trial…\" They paused at a red light and Brendan nodded jerkily, whooshing out the breath he'd been holding. \"Okay, okay great. Hey, you know I didn't mean it like that, Tommy.\" He chuckled nervously. \"Right, I'll give 'em a call.\" He'd been on the verge of saying that no, he didn't know what Brendan meant when he said things anymore but held his tongue, wisely opting to avoid that particular battle right now. Tommy stared out the window, trying to wrap his head around things. A trial. He would get a trial. A chance to prove himself innocent enough, enough to avoid the two years. Community service or whatever the hell they'd stick him with would be fine, anything but jail. Or… He suppressed a shudder. Or heading back out to finish his tour. But they wouldn't make him do that. They couldn't possibly. His shoulder was injured as it was and… No, absolutely not. There was no way in the bloodiest hell he was ever going back out there. They might as well shoot him, and then he would be dead along with the rest of his unit like he was supposed to be. A phone rang. Brendan fiddled with the touchscreen panel on the dash and the call appeared on the screen. Tommy grit his teeth. Of course, state-of-the-art technology for a brand new, expensive car. \"Calling Sara Holgersson,\" the automated voice read. Tommy sat silently, listening to the dial as Brendan chewed his lip. On the fifth ring, the person picked up. \"Brendan Conlon,\" a female voice exclaimed. \"To what do I owe the honor?\" Tommy blinked. Surely Brendan hadn't rung one of his… groupies or whatever. How the hell was a fangirl supposed to defend him in court? The man next to him chuckled, though, smiling as he spoke. \"Sara, my favorite – \" he began, clearly repressing a laugh. Try as he might, Tommy could not find anything remotely amusing. The girl – Sara – cut him off, laughing. \"Oh shut up, you asshole. What do you want?\" \"Aw Sara, what makes you think I want something? Can't I just call to say hi?\" Brendan was grinning sheepishly and Tommy could almost picture the girl rolling her eyes on the other end. \"Right. And how many times have you done that lately?\" Her tone was bitter; like she was genuinely disappointed. Just who was this girl to Brendan? \"Sara,\" his brother started, only to be cut off again. She waved him off breezily. \"Whatever, Bren. What do you want? Better be good if you're calling me at the ass crack of dawn. Earlier than that, actually.\" \"The ass – what? It's like ten thir… oh. Oh shit.\" He let out an embarrassed little chuckle. \"Dammit, I'm sorry Sara. I forgot.\" There was a pause on the other line, then a dry laugh. \"Yeah, you forget a lot of things, Brendan. Things like telling me the mortgage on your house is underwater before going off to fight in fucking Sparta !\" Silence. Brendan's eyes widened almost comically, blinking in disbelief. His mouth opened then closed, then opened again. Tommy squeezed his eyes shut because Jesus Christ , if his brother was gonna start that again… \"You – you didn't know?\" he asked finally. Sara exploded. \"No, I very well didn't know!\" she snapped angrily. \"I'm sorry, I suppose I should have just known . I should have known Rosie had heart surgery, I should have known you couldn't pay off the mortgage, I should have known you'd be a stubborn asshole and get back in the cage after years because you were too proud to ask for help. Maybe I should have just known to stay the hell away from you in the first place because you clearly don't give two shits about anyone but yourself and your crazy psycho wife!\" Brendan looked as if he'd been struck and she huffed a sarcastic laugh. \"You know what, Bren? Let's talk about the things you should have known. You should have known I've been abroad the past year because I distinctly remember you sulking when I left. You should have known I'm in Italy right now and don't speak fucking Italian and would have no way of knowing you were in the stupid tournament. And you should have known that I would have given you the money to keep your house before you went and entered an MMA tourney of the top ten middle-weights in the world! Jesus Bren, you don't even like fighting!\" Harsh breaths echoed through the speakers and both brothers sat frozen, minds reeling at the words. Tommy… Oh, Tommy was going to murder Brendan, brothers be damned. He owed his life to Manny, and Pilar and the kids by extension, and to think he couldn't help provide for them because his brother was a douchebag with too much pride to ask for help, even if he had the means to do so… No , a voice chastised him in his head. No, you're the one who lost. His fists clenched at his sides. You should have won. Never had he utterly loathed anything more than himself. After a silence that hung heavy in the air, Brendan's… friend calmed herself down, sighing into the receiver. \"This is getting nowhere. We will talk, Brendan,\" she said. \"But not right now.\" Sara cleared her throat, pausing for a second. \"Right now you are going to tell me what you wanted. And fast, because international phone calls are hella expensive .\" Brendan had the grace to look contrite, at least. \"Right, yeah. Sara, I need a favor…\" he began, sighing. \"A pretty big favor.\" They pulled into an empty strip mall, expensive car screeching to a halt. \"I need you to come to court with me.\" A pregnant pause filled the line, followed by a choked laugh. \"Brendan,\" she breathed. \"What – what have you done?\" The man rushed to backtrack. \"Well, it's not for me but I… um…\" he trailed off, biting his lip. \"Please, Sara. You have to – \" She cut him off again, a spark of fury burning in her voice. \"I don't have to do anything for you.\" Brendan closed his eyes, head falling back to rest upon the seat. Sara sighed. \"I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. I just… you know I'd rather not go back into law.\" And there it was. The inevitable \"no\" and \"sorry, but there's really nothing I can do\" that he'd been subjected to all his life. Tommy shook his head. And they wondered why he never bothered with hope anymore. The lower his expectations, the less room for disappointment. He relaxed, sprawling out across the leather seat. This conversation no longer appealed to him. Brendan, on the other hand, was not yet so jaded. \"I know,\" he replied quickly. \"I know you wouldn't. But Sara, please, I'm begging you,\" she implored. Huh. The last time Brendan had sounded so desperate had been when he begged Tommy to understand his decision to stay with Tess. Or his \"crazy psycho wife\", as Sara so fondly referred to her as. Tommy snorted in amusement. It was too bad, he mused. If the girl hadn't just inadvertently sealed his fate in a cell for the next two years, he would have liked to meet her. \"What is it?\" His brother cast a look at him, not answering right away. \"Got any experience with military justice?\" he asked instead. And just like that, Brendan managed to score him a defense attorney. \"Your brother,\" Sara said softly. It wasn't a question. Tommy wanted to scream. She knew, of course she knew. The whole world knew his sob story. \"Right. I'll need a case file of details, preferably in the next twenty-four hours. I'm taking the next flight out tomorrow.\" Her voice was suddenly business; sharp and determined. Tommy's head snapped up. A case file of details. Next flight out. Maybe hope wasn't such an absurdity. He stole a look at his brother in the seat beside him. The man wore a soft smile, full of relief and… pride, maybe. \"Sara,\" Brendan breathed, chuckling quietly. \"Have I told you I loved you lately?\" A real laugh filled the speakers, bright and clear and inexplicably adorable, and when the sound died out, Tommy decided he wanted to hear that laugh again. \"But what changed your mind?\" Brendan asked, brow furrowing in confusion. Absent was the \"He's your brother, I have to!\" or the \"Oh, his story's so sad, of course I'll help!\" he'd been expecting. Instead, Sara said simply, \"Could be the only case actually worth winning.\" And he was left to decipher the implications of that. Brendan nodded, a thoughtful look in his eye. \"Well, thank you nonetheless,\" he told her softly. \"You have no idea how much I appreciate it. I'll let you go now, but we'll catch up when you land tomorrow, yeah?\" \"Sure, tomorrow. We have a lot to catch up on.\" Sara reminded him. \"And you don't have to thank me.\" She paused before hanging up. \"I'm not doing this for you.\" There was the telltale click of the line being cut. Neither brother said a word as Brendan pulled out of the mall. Tommy stared out the window at the stars dotting the night sky, the sun long since faded away. Sara Holgersson. Sara fell back in her bed with a groan. It was way too early for all this. And she was just so angry with Brendan. God, he was supposed to be her best friend. She's saved his ass countless times over but when it really mattered, of course his stupid pride got in the way of asking for help. And of course he only called her when he needed something. At four in the goddamned morning, no less. She needed a drink. Going back to law. What the hell had she gotten herself into? Sighing, the girl began to pack, folding up clothes and toiletries and tossing them into her huge ass suitcase. She'd been abroad for the better part of a year, and honest to God, traveling was heavy. As she fit her things into her bag, Sara wondered why she'd really agreed to help Bren. Sure, he was her best friend but it wasn't like she owed him anything. In fact, she'd done her part in that friendship more than needed. But maybe this case would be what she always hoped for in law. A real fight for justice rather than countless petty suits from people with more than enough money to spare. Maybe it would be the one job that actually made her feel like someone; like she was doing something that actually mattered , something that she gave a rat's ass about. Maybe it would be the first case she wouldn't hate herself for winning. Or maybe it was just Tommy. Sure, she'd heard bits and pieces about him through Brendan but it was clear the brothers weren't close and Sara had never been one to keep pressing for information. But when she'd finally gotten wind of the whole Sparta thing… As much as she was loath to admit it, Sara (as well as half of America) had been captivated by the dark, enigmatic war hero. Who, albeit a bit rugged, may have also looked like he stepped straight out of GQ mag. She shook her head, flopping back down onto the bed. For whatever reasons, she'd already agreed to the defense. There was a packed bag and a plane ticket waiting for her at 8:00 AM. She couldn't turn back now. ","Summary":" A/N: New (and first) story, woohoo! I stumbled across this movie and was so blown away by it that I"},{"Movie":"Warrior, 2011","Title":"La Vida Normal","Author":"Brujhah","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12274691","Passage":"[Chapter 1] 1 Elizabeth Cavendish le rehuía o, al menos, su cuerpo siempre lo hacía. Tommy había notado con molestia que, a pesar de ello, la muchacha no tenía problema alguno en hablarle directamente, dedicarle alguna insignificante broma o, en su defecto, preguntarle cosas. Siempre y cuando entre ambos existieran algunos metros de separación o varias personas, o algún mueble que marcara una frontera fija y definida, el espacio que debía alejarlos uno del otro. Y eso le hacia sospechar que, tal vez, para la chica él apestaba ya fuera física o metafóricamente. Lo que, claramente, dejaba bastante que desear sobre sus modales. Y eso sin considerar que él tampoco era un derroche de cortesía. Pero Elizabeth no tenía excusa; supuestamente era una chica educada -o quizás Michael mentía- que trabajaba y estudiaba mientras que se hermano ayudaba en el gimnasio y entrenaba con él. Michael Cavendish, por su parte, era igual de taciturno que su hermana. Tommy no podía calificar a ninguno de ellos como tímidos aunque si introvertidos, igual que él. Quizás por eso le molestaban, los silencios de Michael se parecían mucho a los propios, las veces que se enfrentaban en el cuadrílatero llegaba a ser abrumadora la forma en la cual el chico recibía sus golpes y repartía los propios sin emitir quejido alguno que, al igual que las pocas palabras de Elizabeth, tenían el mismo tono que las suyas. O eso pensaba en ocasiones, cuando se daba el tiempo de analizar a ambos hermanos. Por lo mismo lo extraño de la presente situación; estaba a solas con Elizabeth a quién había sorprendido en la entrada del gimnasio. Para él era temprano: casi las siete de la tarde, aunque en Invierno aquello significaba completa oscuridad. La chica había reaccionado pasmada cuando el detuvo su trote frente a ella. La forma que tenía de recogerse le fastidio desde que notó quién era ella y cuando la vio alejarse sonrió -muy escuetamente desde luego- al ver que la mampara de cristal detuvo su retroceso. No había espacio para que ella se alejara todos sus preciosos metros. Fue entonces que recordó todo ello. Sin mencionar, que era la primera vez que, efectivamente, se encontraban a tan corta distancia. ― ¿Como estás Tommy? ― preguntó con seguridad en su voz, la que era desmentida de inmediato por su expresión corporal. Tommy sabía reconocerlas, era una de las capacidades que había adquirido en el ejército, saber cuando alguien no le quería cerca; era lo que, obviamente, invadir un país de desconocidos generaba en los nativos. \"Rechazo\" Eso era lo que Elizabeth Cavendish le causaba, la constante sensación de sentirse rechazado. No contestó pero si dio dos pasos más hacia ella. Se vio ridícula cuando trató de poner la misma distancia avanzada entre ellos y pudo ver algo parecido al pánico en su cara; así como es que sus ojos azul oscuro reflejaron molestia al verse descubierta. Dio dos pasos más y en esa ocasión Elizabeth no trató de alejarse. El silencio se extendió por todo el lugar y se pudo imaginar así mismo como una sombra alta, fornida y oscura avanzando sobre una víctima. ― ¿Acaso me tienes miedo? ― preguntó Tommy con tono neutral, casi familiar. De haber podido la chica habría retrocedido todos los centímetros que su cuerpo y el espacio a su alrededor le permitiera y, sin saber porque, asintió. Tommy en cambio si lo hizo, deliberadamente se posicionó bajo el foco halogeno de la entrada, no sabía si molesto. Se llevó las manos a los bolsillos de su campera y movió el mondadientes de su boca. ― No tienes por qué hacerlo ¿sabes? ― dijo finalmente mirando hacia el interior del gimnasio. Elizabeth se incorporó tratando de mantener la vista baja, automáticamente su atención se centró en los pies de Tommy, quién ese día calzaba unas botas gruesas y altas hasta la canilla. Había visto como usaba aquella parte de su cuerpo y el sonido que los golpes de estas solían emitir. ― Tengo… ― balbuceó al final, incomoda e intimidada ― … tengo que irme ― Elizabeth alzó la capucha de su chaqueta y se cruzó de brazos. Hacía frío, era precisamente el 12 de Diciembre y la nieve se había acumulado en la última hora, volviendo complejo el acto de caminar. Ella también llevaba botas altas, pero aun así el frío calaba dentro de sus pies. Y mientras, Tommy parecía completamente impasible, ella no pudo evitar pensar si es que realmente él; Tommy Conlon, aunque siempre decía que era Riordan, sintiera algo. ― Le… ¿Le podrías decir a Michael…? ― Tommy no esperó el final de la respuesta y solo asintió, de nuevo con la vista fija en el gimnasio. La muchacha murmuró un gracias, antes de darle la espalda y aprestarse a volver a su hogar. ― ¿Por qué lo haces? ― preguntó de pronto Tommy. Sonando lo suficientemente fuerte como para detenerla en medio de la acera. Elizabeth volteó a medias, con los brazos aún cruzados. Lo miró extrañada. ― Nunca te hecho algo, a ti o a tu hermano ― dijo, esta vez fijando la vista en ella. Elizabeth enderezó su postura y algo en su mirada le hizo entender que, a su vez, ella también comprendía la razón tras su pregunta. Y muy diferente a lo que se había dado en los últimos segundos, le pareció que la muchacha esbozaba una sonrisa. ― Lo sé, es solo… ― entonces ella se giró completamente hacia él. Tommy alzó las cejas esperando su respuesta. ― ¿Qué? ― Todo el tiempo pareces enojado… y ― Elizabeth se relajó y bajó los brazos, apretó los labios como si se tragara algunas palabras ―… y eso ― finalizó con tono cansado ― lamento si te molesta. Lo había hecho, pero no se lo diría. ― ¿Por qué habría de molestarme? ― preguntó directo ―es solo tu opinión ― cortó, esta vez dándole él la espalda a ella y adentrándose en el gimnasio. Elizabeth lo vio saludar al muchacho del mesón y luego dirigirse hacia los casilleros del lugar, sin mirar una sola vez atrás. Maggie lo saludó en cuanto le vio, le dedicó una sonrisa coqueta y abierta mientras sacudía su brazo con efusividad llamándolo en voz alta, Tommy no respondió. No porque no le interesara, sino debido a que la chica rápidamente dejó de prestarle atención para esquivar los golpes de Nathalie, su contrincante, quién aprovechando la distracción le envió dos rápidos movimientos hacia la cabeza. Eso sacó una leve sonrisa del rostro de Tommy, la cual ahogó de inmediato. Sacó su equipo del casillero y se llevó el bolso al hombro. Ese día no entrenaría, tenía un trabajo de medio tiempo en un evento de música en el centro de la ciudad. Y debía ir a casa, darse una ducha y vestirse con el traje que le entregaran. Saludó a un par de chicos más y no tomó en cuenta los besos que Maggie le envió cuando volvió a pasar por el lado del cuadrilatero que ambas usaban. De todas maneras, con una idea sobre su cabeza que no fue capaz de apartar, cuando se devolvió sobre sus pasos y encaró a la chica; Maggie tenía veintiún años y era campeona nacional en su peso, era una chica lista y afectuosa que desde que cruzaran el primer saludo le había coqueteado abiertamente, sin llegar nunca a ser fastidiosa. Tommy se había dedicado un par de veces a observarla mientras combatía, admirando la velocidad de sus golpes y sus curvas. Tenía un rostro con forma de corazón y grandes y vivaces ojos verdes. ― ¡Maggie! ― la llamó sabiendo que la chica acudiría de inmediato. Ella alzó la cabeza como un ciervo que huele a su cazador, solo que en vez de mostrarse asustada, de nuevo le sonrió abiertamente y trotó con elegancia hacia él. Tommy se incorporó sobre el ring y sosteniéndose del poste se acercó a ella. Ella jamás me rechazaría. Con Maggie se sentía acogido y aceptado. Si, incluso como él era. Incluso enojado todo el tiempo. ― ¿Me tienes miedo? ― preguntó directo y secó. Maggie siquiera se extraño, se alejó unos pocos centímetros y le sonrió brillante. Gesto que él replicó en su rostro, aún cuando quiso evitarlo. ― ¿Porque debería temerte Riordan? ― contesto burlesca y desafiante. Ella sabía que él prefería ese apellido al de Conlon. Y aprovechaba cada instante para darle a entender que, incluso en pequeños detalles como ese, estaba dispuesta a complacerle. Volvió a fijar los ojos en el rostro de Maggie, Maggie Green. Tommy sabía que si se lo pedía ella no pondría objeción alguna en irse con él y, claramente, dejarle hacer lo que quisiera. Ella, desde luego también respondería de la manera audaz y sin miedo en la cual solía contestarle, tuteándolo cuando quería, tocándolo con poca sutileza pero, al mismo tiempo, respetando el espacio que él exigía. Quizás debería invitarla a salir. ― ¿Entonces no? ― preguntó de vuelta. ― Solo si quieres luchar... entonces lo pensaría ― Tommy no cambió su gesto serio, solo que esta vez un vago atisbo de curiosidad cubrió sus ojos. ― ¿Estarías dispuesta a luchar contra mi? ―ella sonrió aún más coqueta y se acercó a centímetros de su rostro, Tommy notó como es que todo el gimnasio le observaba, aún cuando no alzó la vista a nadie. ― Solo si yo puedo elegir donde y como ― dicho eso, la chica cortó toda la distancia y le dio un suave beso en la nariz. Dio dos brincos hacia atrás mientras hacia chocar los guantes y habló con fuerza. ― ¡Ahora vete Riordan, me distraes! ― su sonrisa era más amplia que nunca y sacó varias carcajadas de sus compañeros de gimnasio incluso de Nathalie que contestó su gesto de despedida antes de volver con Maggie. Tommy descendió del ring, en medio de las burlas de sus compañeros que le llamaban cobarde al, aparentemente, retroceder ante la insinuación de la muchacha. Él podría ser feliz con una chica como Maggie. Difícil sería, sin embargo, que ella pudiera encontrar la felicidad en alquién como él. Aunque Brendan era feliz con Tess. Quizás ese no era el mejor ejemplo; Brendan los había abandonado por ella. Pensar en eso lo llenó de amargura, se había prometido no dejar que el pasado le afectara. Pero no se engañaba, él sabía que esas heridas por mucho que se hubieran lavado seguían escosiendo. \"Rechazo\" Sus ideas vagaron hacia Elizabeth Cavendish y la forma en la cual le rehuía. No, no dejaría que aquello lo desanimara. Centró sus pensamientos en Brendan, en su hermano y su esposa, en sus sobrinas. Por supuesto que agradecía que le hubiera ayudado cuando lo encarcelaron y el juicio que prosiguió después, que cubriera los gastos de sus abogados pero mentiría si dijera que eso los había acercado. Simplemente era extraño creerlo, o siquiera pensarlo. Tal vez estaba demasiado acostumbrado a la soledad y a la dureza del mundo para aceptar así como así los gestos afectivos que su entorno buscaba entregarle: los besos coquetos de Maggie, la constante necesidad de acercarlo a su familia, imaginaba que a instancias de Tess; una cena en su casa, una tarde para que conociera a sus sobrinas. Él sencillamente no había respondido a nada. No podía hacerlo, era extraño, demasiado extraño. \"Yo también puedo rechazar\" Podía convencerse de eso, era mucho más fácil. Que no necesitaba ni a Brendan y menos a Elizabeth, pero su cabeza le traicionaba. Ya que sus pensamientos solo se centraba en ellos, en como uno le buscaba y la otra le rehuía. Era, en parte, lo que había ocurrido con sus padres; su madre murió cuando perdió las esperanzas den que Paddy apareciera. Había sido cruel y triste verla consumirse mientras rezaba todas las noches, todos los días por su padre. Pero así mismo, y Tommy había llegado a odiarla por ello, entendía que era lo que le mantuvo despierta, consiente y viva: la ilusión de que Paddy Conlon cambiara y volviera por ella. No lo había hecho por él, tampoco por Brendan. Sus oraciones y esperanzas estaban en que su padre, el maldito que la había golpeado más de una vez hasta la inconsciencia. El hombre al cual había amado, el que era su padre; ahora un viejo que llevaba dos años sin beber. \"Fue mi rechazo lo que le hizo recaer nuevamente\" Y aquello, le resultaba incluso extraño a él, no lo llenaba de culpa. \"Paddy se lo merecía\" Seguían viviendo juntos en aquella extraña relación que mantenían, hablándose cuando se trataba de peleas y entrenamiento era demasiado incomodo el tratar de buscar algún tema adicional de conversación, no habían ni las ganas, ni el tiempo para dedicarse a ello. Sin embargo, su padre no le buscaba para ofrecer un tardío afecto, lo ocurrido en Atlantic City les había dejado lecciones a ambos y él lo prefería. Se saludaban al llegar y se despedían al salir, cenaban juntos sin cruar palabra alguna. No había preguntas por trabajo, horarios, chicas -que no existían- nada que pudiera calificarlos como padre e hijo. Eran dos conocidos que se toleraban y trataban con la mayor condescendecia posible. Y hasta ese momento había funcionado bstante bien. Eso le recordó al día en que saliera de prisión. Cuando ambos; Brendan y Paddy habían ido por él. Los tres se subieron al auto de su padre y ninguno habló en todo el trayecto. Si hubo incomodidad él siquiera la sintió, no estaba su cabeza en lo que podría ocurrir en aquél auto o lo que se pudiera hablar, además Brendan tampoco parecía muy contento de compartir con su padre, entonces solo los dejó. Había pasado nueve meses en prisión por desertar del ejercito y abandonar su unidad. Los nueve meses en que había durado su juicio. En serio, pedirle que fuera un acompañante cordial o elocuente era demasiado. En las primeras sesiones el tribunal había estado lleno de prensa, al final de su juicio siquiera uno que otro periodista. Vio a su hermano hablar por televisión, vio a su padre y a los chicos del pelotón que había salvado, vio a sus comandantes a Pilar y sus hijos. Todos y cada uno de ellos hablando por él, hablando en su contra, hablando de él. Por orden de su abogado se entrevisto con un psiquiatra, el cuál declaró que debido al fuego amigo que eliminó a su pelotón y a su mejor amigo \" un hermano \" declaró su defensor, había sufrido estrés postraumático. Una enfermedad altamente documentada en veteranos de guerra. El cual, si bien no se manifestaba a diario si había generado en él; depresión, arranques de ira, constante sensación de soledad y un largo etcétera de síntomas con los que no se identificaba ni jamás se identificó. Pero había sido el discurso de su abogado para justificar, en parte, su actuar. Lo que le dio los resultados esperados, el tribunal militar le dio la baja deshonrosa, pero se salvó de los cargos de traición y una condena que en su mínimo grado le habria enviado por diez años a la cárcel. Siendo honesto Tommy sabía que de no haber salvado a aquél grupo de chicos, la historia sería muy diferente. Aunque tal vez de no hacerlo, siquiera habría participado en Sparta. Imaginaba que aún estaría en El Paso, viviendo a expensas del cariño de Manny, Pilar y los niños. A quienes él si consideraba su familia. Para él no había excusa; confusión, error, \"fuego amigo\". Los suyos, sus verdaderos hermanos estaban muertos, él debería haber caído con ellos. En cambio, al salir de prisión su padre y hermano lo esperaban. Personas con quiénes no tenía toda una vida en común pero con quienes no quería estar. Esos habían quedado para hacerle compañía. Y a Tommy le resultaban completamente ajenos a él. Hacia mucho frío, el cuello le apretaba y no estaba acostumbrado a las corbatas. Desde luego el terno, su uniforme de trabajo aquella noche, mejoraba mucho su aspecto. Suavizaba las reacciones hostiles que despertaba en el resto cuando lo veían con su común buzo de entrenamiento. Sin mencionar que muchas de las chicas y señoras se quedaron fijas mirándole por más de los segundos a los que estaba acostumbrado y más de alguna le sonrió, con el mismo gesto que Maggie solía dedicarle. Aún así, Tommy estaba luchando contra el impulso de arrancarse la sobria corbata y soltarse el apretado cuello. Solo el frío lo evitaba, sentía las manos entumecidas y el rostro helado, muy helado. Sonaron algunas bromas soeces por el intercomunicador que llevaba en su oído y sonrió. Le recordó la camaradería del ejercito, la forma en la cual él y sus compañeros se trataban. Su cargo era de jefe, era él quién precisamente se encontraba en medio de todo; los jefes -mayores que él- supervisaban todo desde la sala de control, viendo a través de las cámaras que el evento se realizara con tranquilidad, quizás bebiendo algo para el frío con los administradores del recinto. Los más jóvenes se dedicaban a controlar la gente que entraba, a aquellos que pertenecían al espectáculo y vigilar que los accesos de seguridad no se vieran bloqueados. El era el puente entre los dueños y aquellos muchachos. De ellos provenían las bromas que le sacaban sonrisas vagas y de los jefes las ordenes. Los chicos le tenían respeto. Siempre lo miraban con atención y acataban todas sus órdenes sin cuestionar nada, tal cual él lo hiciera años atrás. Muchos incluso habían terminado su ejercicio militar y, tal cual él, habían encontrado una ocupación en la seguridad. De la misma manera esporádica en la cual lo hacía. Era un beneficio, le habían ofrecido el correspondiente contrato y sus prestaciones. Pero Tommy se había negado, su idea era dedicarse a la lucha. De todas las posibles cosas que pudiera hacer luchar era lo que realmente le atraía y emocionaba. Estudios, familia, una ocupación fija, nada de eso le interesaba. Solo el saber que tendría el tiempo suficiente para dar y recibir algunos golpes. Algo contra lo que un contrato fijo, aún con todos sus beneficios, no podía competir. De todas maneras sabía que le agradaba a sus jefes; John Goodman, era un hombre que bordeaba los cincuenta años, de vientre abultado y rostro jovial. Lo había contactado una vez que saliera de prisión, primero para probarlo en las entradas. Algo que funcionada, Tommy sabía y considerando la forma en la cual Elizabeth había actuado ese día, era prueba suficiente del miedo que era capaz de inspirar solo cambiando de posición, ofreciendo una mirada dura y seria. No pasó mucho tiempo hasta que John comenzó a llevarlo a otro tipo de eventos. Tenía una agencia de seguridad de cierto prestigio que cada vez prestaba sus servicios a una mayor cantidad clientes. Y aquellos en los cuales los invitados pertenecían a la clase alta de la sociedad se habían vuelto habituales en el calendario de Tommy. Eran mucho más tranquilos que los eventos masivos y eso lo agradecía. Si bien la idea principal de tenerlo a él como guardia era inspirar miedo en aquellos que pudieran ocasionar conflictos, su figura, altura y forma no se desaprovechaban en lo absoluto. ― Tommy ― sonó por el intercomunicador la voz de Mario Saldaña, administrador del recinto ― ¿Tommy, me escuchas? ― Atento señor ― contestó mecánicamente, mientras hacia un gesto al chico de la entrada para que le dejara pasar. ― Hay un problema en el baño de damas del subterráneo, ya llamamos a la policía pero los chicos no pueden controlarlo, lleva contigo a algunos. Llamar a la policía, había ocurrido en un par de ocasiones y ninguna de ellas fue algo agradable. ― De inmediato señor ― Tommy hizo señas a Jacob y Madeleine, quienes dejaron la revisión de los boletos para ir con él. No tardaron en llegar a su destino. Uno de sus chicos estaba recibiendo atención de otro que le ayudaba a sostener su nariz mientras limpiaban la sangre. Ambos lucían golpeados, sus corbatas y camisas estaban fuera de lugar con señales claras de forcejeo. Tommy los envidió. Las luces halógenas se apagaron y encendieron lo que le dio una sensación de vacío y oscuridad, le parecieron pobres en aquél momento. A su gusto, era como si de la nada la oscuridad se hubiera apoderado de tan tranquilo evento. No era nuevo, ya lo había visto antes. Fue cuando piso algo pequeño y duro, notó entonces los cristales de las luces en el suelo las cuales barrió con su zapato. La situación parecía controlada, le hizo una seña a Madeleine para que acudiera con los muchachos y Jacob continuó con él. Escuchó como la muchacha, por radio, solicitaba a uno de los enfermeros y consultaba por la demora de la policía. Era el procedimiento. Despegó su atención de ella en cuanto se acercó a la entrada del baño. No esperó a golpear para entrar, la puerta estaba abierta a todo lo que daba y con señales claras de haber sido forzada. El lugar a su vez, tenía la misma precaria iluminación que el pasillo, las baldosas negras y brillantes parecían absorver la poca iluminación del lugar. Él, que conocía todo ese espacio sabía que las lámparas eran de luz cálida y tenue al lado de los espejos. Sin embargo estas habían sido destruidas y probablemente la luz de emergencia se había encendido, la que a su vez también había sido afectada por la violencia ejercida ahí. Un foco parpadeó y Tommy pudo escuchar el llanto proveniente de uno de las casetas de los retretes. Era un hombre de edad. La imagen de Paddy Conlon, ebrio y balbuceante se coló en su cabeza pero la anuló de inmediato cuando vio un zapato fino de tacón quebrado más cerca de la entrada que de su dueña, también lo movió con el pie. Entre dos lavabos, bajo una de las lámparas que había sobrevivido a la pelea, una mujer de vestido claro y rasgado yacía atendida por otra. La muchacha atacada sostenía una chaqueta contra su pecho como si se cubriera. Tommy no tardó en imaginarse el cuadro en su cabeza; una pelea de amantes en donde él atacó a su novia o, más sórdido aún, él sujeto intento violar a la chica. La otra mujer los sorprende, llama a sus muchachos y entre los tres los separan. El vestido claro estaba manchado con sangre. La policía ya había sido llamada. Desde donde estaba preguntó: ― ¿Se encuentra bien señorita? ― la chica que estaba en suelo alzó la mano afirmativamente, solo entonces Tommy pudo apreciar que tenía fuertes y feos golpes directos en el rostro. Sabía el porque de ello, pero aún así no pudo evitar sentirse lleno de rabia. Él y Jacob se acercaron hacia el hombre. ― ¿Que ocurrió? ― preguntó. Sabía que no era su obligación hacerlo pero él no solía reaccionar bien cuando se trataba de mujeres golpeadas. Las que fueran por la razón que fuera. Miró a Jacob quién cada ciertos segundos volvía la vista hacia las muchachas. El sujeto negó. Tommy respiró. ― Ya se ha llamado a la policía señor ¿hay alguien a quién deba informarle? ― el viejo carraspeó. ― ¿Informar que imbécil? ― preguntó alzando los ojos claros hacia él, con el rostro contraído con lágrimas, rasguños y la boca mordida. \"Se lo merece\" ― Tommy ― escuchó a su espalda y Mario junto a John y la policía se habían apersonado en el lugar. Tommy asintió y se alejó del sujeto, de inmediato Mario se acercó a él y la policía al victimario. ― ¿Te dijo algo? ― Tommy negó. ― Traté de ver si es que debíamos avisarle a alguien más, no me dio respuesta ― Mario asintió conforme y le pidió que ayudara a las chicas. Tommy se acercó a ellas y se inclino. La mujer agredida era rubia, algo que no había notado antes. \"Maggie le habría dado su merecido a este imbécil sin sudar una gota\" Y la chica que le ayudaba, su acompañante, su acompañante... Se quedó estático al notar que Elizabeth Cavendish le miraba fijamente, ninguno de los dos emitió palabra alguna aunque se reconocieron. Y era claro que ella le había notado desde que se hiciera presente en el lugar. \"Siempre busca alejarme, le parezco todo el tiempo enojado\" Solo que en esa ocasión un gesto de aprobación cruzaba el rostro de la muchacha. Fue ella quién le habló a la mujer golpeada. ― Hay enfermeros y ya ha llegado la policía ¿Tienes a alguien a quién avisarle? ― la muchacha asintió ― ¿Quieres que los llame? ― la muchacha negó. Fue cuando la policía se acercó a ella, una oficial y un enfermero pidieron espacio y tanto Elizabeth como Tommy retrocedieron. El cabello de Elizabeth estaba alborotado, lo que contrastaba con el peinado lacio del resto de sus compañeras. Ella estaba en el evento como parte del espectáculo, tocaba el violín casi escondida en medio de todos los músicos de la orquesta. Llevaba un año y un poco más de conocerla y jamás habría imaginado que ella era músico. Sabía que tenía trabajos esporádicos como los de él. Era solo que nunca se había interesado en saberlo. Al fin de cuentas ella le rehuía. Era normal que no tuviera mucha información sobre su vida. Una de sus compañeras había tratado de ordenar su cabello mientras se mantenían tras bastidores, al final otra de ellas apareció con un prendedor de forma de araña del que colgaban figuras de hojas y perlas para disfrazar el desastre en el cual había terminado su peinado. De todas maneras se trataba de la mitad de la cabeza que no daba al público y además Elizabeth se fundía bien con sus compañeros. Por lo que no llamó la atención de nadie. Excepto la de él, claro. Se la encontró después en el bar del recinto, llevaba ropa mucho más casual que cuando la encontrara en el baño; un vestido negro igual al de sus compañeras en la orquesta. Estaba intrigado, no solo de verla ahí sino de saber lo que había ocurrido en al baño así como lo habló con la policía que la interrogó algunos minutos después de que se llevaran a la chica y al sujeto con ellos. Su turno había terminado hace solo veinte minutos, e inconscientemente había estado buscándola, hasta que la divisó en el bar. Cuando se aceró notó que ella escribía un mensaje en su celular y que bebía -no supo descifrar que-, y de todas las interrogantes que tenía en su cabeza solo pudo decir: ― No sabía que eras músico ― y algo en su tono consiguió que por primera vez en mucho tiempo ella no intentara alejarse de él. Quedó completamente devastado cuando ella le extendió, a él, el sujeto a quién temía una cansada pero honesta sonrisa. ― Ahora lo sabes ― Tommy no pudo evitar contestar el gesto y acercarse a la barra, solo pidió una cerveza que el barman no tardó en entregar. Le agradeció con un asentimiento. ― ¿Encontraste a Michael? ― preguntó recordando el encargo de la muchacha cuando se vieran esa tarde. ― Oh, no ― contestó ella sin dejar de lado su celular ― espero que no pasara hambre ― alzó la vista hacia él completamente entregada a usarlo de interlocutor y en su gesto, Tommy no supo porque había algo de tranquilidad. No le rehuía, no bajaba la vista ante él y le observaba atenta ― por eso lo buscaba hoy, deje comida lista en el horno pero Michael tiene cierta fijación en entrar a la cocina. Aquellas pocas palabras era mucho más de lo que nunca hubieran hablado, además que le daba un atisbo de lo que era algo privado pero tan sencillo como que a su hermano no le gustaba cocinar. ― ¿Le da miedo o no sabe? ― preguntó volviendo a su cerveza, dio un trago. Elizabeth ladeo la cabeza de un lado a otro, estaba cansada era completamente visible. ― Creo que ambos ― suspiró ― es difícil creerlo cuando uno lo ve entrenar contigo Conlon ― y a diferencia de otras ocasiones Tommy no reaccionó. Se quedó observándola con atención; jugaba con su trago color ámbar y si bien parecía relajada, su pie derecho golpeaba de manera rápida y repetida una de las patas de acero de su asiento. La vio mojarse los labios antes de dar otro trago. Quizás estaba ebria. ― ¿Por que me llamas así? ― preguntó finalmente. La chica se le quedó mirando como si no entendiera. De pronto sus ojos se iluminaron. ― Cierto, leí tu historia ― se puso de pie ― lo lamento, no volverá a pasar ― bebió todo el contenido de su vaso y extendió un gesto hacia el barman dejando veinte dolares sobre la mesa. Volvió a mirarle ― en serio lo lamento Tommy, no volverá a pasar. Y sin decir nada más cogió su abrigo y el estuche que contenía su violín. Le dio la espalda al mismo tiempo en que, sin detenerse, se colocaba su abrigo. Tommy fue tras ella dispuesto a dejar en claro algunas cosas, cuando la alcanzó no dio ningún rodeo. ― No me he enojado si es lo que piensas ― Elizabeth se detuvo, sorprendida de que le siguiera. ― Si, lo creí ― contestó y después de examinarlo continuó ― pero es cierto que no pareces enojado. Tommy se vistió con una gruesa chaqueta de chiporro, se llevó las manos a los bolsillos y encogió de hombros. Miró hacia la entrada y habló: ― Vamos en la misma dirección y es tarde... Ella no lo dejó terminar. ― Claro ― contestó con un tono más alto de lo que solía hablarle, Tommy estaba seguro de que, si bien, no estaba ebria el alcohol había hecho su trabajo en ella ― tomaré el autobus, podemos ir juntos. Tommy salió despidiéndose de los chicos que cambiaban de turno y ella le siguió. No tenía intenciones de hablar de nada, y tampoco sabía que decirle. Aunque claramente seguía lleno de dudas. ― ¿Como es eso que leíste sobre mí? ― preguntó de pronto notando que por primera vez y a pesar de sus propias ideas, el silencio se le estaba haciendo molesto. ― Oh, eso ― contestó ella ― Michael estaba alucinando cuando volviste al gimnasio, él me dijo que te buscara. Internet esta plagado de blog´s y foros sobre ti y el torneo en el cual participaste ― Tommy se giró a verla, pero ella parecía concentrada en el camino. ― Sparta ― dijo. Y ella no reaccionó. De todas maneras le gustó que supiera de él, o que se hubiera dado el tiempo para informarse. Solo que no entendía el porque, a pesar de ello, le temía. ― Y ¿aún así me tenías miedo? ― en esa ocasión fue ella quién volteó hacia él. ― ¿Quién no podría hacerlo? ― sonrió ― ¿Has visto el gesto que haces cuando combates? es... es escalofriante ― así que ella le había visto combatir. ― Pero ahora no pareces asustada ― la muchacha se encogió de hombros. ― Ahora no te ves amenazante. En esa ocasión le tocó a él sonreír. Hacía frío, y a medida que avanzaran las horas lo haría más. Dentro de todo había sido una noche movida, con el asunto de la chica golpeada. Sin embargo, no sabía porque pero se sentía tranquilo, muy tranquilo. Será corta, lo prometo. Y trataré de no golpearlos con mi irregularidad. Espero lo disfruten. Saludos.[Chapter 2] 2 Pilar estaba en la cocina y los niños pasaron corriendo por el pasillo, gritando \"¡Ahab! ¡Ahab!\" . Lo que he les valió un fuerte llamado de atención de Manny. Le parecía que fue ese el principal ruido que debió despertarlo. No podía recordar en que momento había regresado a El Paso, a la casa de los Fernández, su familia. El cuerpo sobre él se movió excitándole de inmediato. Supo entonces que era un sueño, así como que de ser su descisión se quedaría ahí toda la vida. Era de día, su cabeza se lo decía pero en aquella habitación solo eran visibles los finos rayos de sol que se colaban de la persiana en su escueta ventana. Afuera se desarrollaba la vida y la muerte. La guerra continuaba en medio del desierto y en el estado nevado de Pittsburgh la nieve caía sobre Elizabeth, la chica que le rehuía porque le temía. El cuerpo de otra muchacha se alzó sobre él mostrando sus rubios cabellos y sonriéndole como si fuera lo único importante en el mundo. \" Ella no me teme\" Acercó su rostro al de él y lo besó con fuerza, apasionada y desinhibida mientras él enterraba sus manos en sus cabellos rubios que le cosquilleaban el rostro. \" Ahora no luces intimidante\" Colt estaba lleno a rebosar, las cámaras lo buscaban pero él las ignoró. Las jaulas del Sparta rebozaban de gente y los marines le cantaban una canción mientras Beethoven dirigía una orquesta. Y los besos de Maggie le hacían perder el control, quería estrujarla, girarla y montarse sobre ella, recorrer con sus manos encallecidas por el uso del armamento aquella espalda fina, apretar esos muslos que eran capaz de desencajarle los brazos y romperle el cuello. En medio de la orquesta un pendiente de araña estaba en el suelo junto a un zapato fino de tacón quebrado. Elizabeth alzó la vista hacia él y cansada le sonrió. Abrió los ojos y vio que Maggie se sacudía sobre él montándolo sin misericordia, le dolió el hombro y Brendan extendió su brazo para acunarlo mientras su cabeza se llenaba de preguntas. \"No sabía que eras músico\" \"¡Lo siento Tommy!\" lloró su hermano, mientras ambos se retorcían en el suelo de la jaula, en el Sparte, hace mil años atrás. El cabello de Maggie se alargó y oscureció. Los ojos azul oscuro de Elizabeth lo miraron con fijeza cuando le contestó. \"Ahora lo sabes\" Entonces fue él quien cortó toda distancia en medio de una calle, hundió su mano en el cabello oscuro y atrayéndola desde la nuca la besó. Abrió los ojos despacio, como si sus parpados pesaran más de lo normal. \"No fue real\" Y había terminado justo cuando deseo que continuara. Sin embargo, el sueño le había dejado sus marcas y una molesta erección comenzó a palpitarle. Se tocó fastidiado. Si, al menos, hubiera terminado con Maggie, no tendría ese problema. \"No... tendría otro igual de molesto y mucho más sucio\" Cuando parpadeó nuevamente, llegaron a sus oídos las noticias; algo más sobre la guerra y luego un reportaje sobre los daños psicológicos que afectaban a los veteranos. Recordaba que ese había sido parte del alegato de su defensa. \"Estrés postraumático\" Lo cierto es que jamás le había dado las gracias a su padre por prepararlo para todo aquél caos. Paddy Conlon en la época que él le conociera había sido un sujeto duro y agresivo, era claro que el tipo de educación que les entregó a él y a Brendan había sido similar a la que él sufriera. Su padre había estado en Vietnam y, hasta donde él sabía tampoco había sido víctima del \" estrés postráumatico \". O quizás, ambos lo sufrieron pero ya tenían tan jodida la cabeza que simplemente era algo... normal, común. Se dio una ducha caliente y larga. Resultaba reconfortante saber que mientras afuera el frío era inmisericorde, él se encontraba a resguardo bajo un chorro del agua que le abrigaba y relajaba en partes iguales. Diferente de lo ocurrido horas atrás. Durante la noche había esperado largo rato parado al lado de Elizabeth mientras llegaba algún servicio de autobus. No habían tenido refugio alguno al cual acudir cuando la nieve comenzó a caer con más fuerza y ya pasada una hora decidieron pedir un taxi. Había sido agradable para todos sus sentidos cuando al entrar al automóvil el calor los golpeo. La nieve le había mojado sus pantalones y la ropa de Elizabeth, que parecía más delgada que la suya había sufrido lo mismo. Junto con ello sintió el deseo de abrazarla pero no hizo nada, notó cuando el chofer los miró una y otra vez por el espejo retrovisor, esperando que a esa hora el único tipo de parejas que podían llamarlo debían ser de amantes. En tanto ella, había echado la cabeza hacia atrás y no tardó en caer dormida. Tommy debió despertarla cuando llegaron a su casa. Se mostró algo mareada y le miró con verdadera extrañeza al despertar, como si no le reconociera. Pero solo fue un segundo. De inmediato recordó y comenzó a buscar en medio de sus ropas. Le habría gustado decirle que no, que él pagaba ante la vaga idea de descender con ella e ir juntos a su hogar. En cambio no hizo nada. Aceptó el pago de ella y siquiera esperó que la chica entrara en su casa para ver que llegara bien. ¿Que podría pasarle entre la acera y la puerta? El taxista se le quedó mirando pero Tommy lo ignoró hasta que debió pagar su cuenta cuando lo dejó en la entrada de su hogar. En aquél presciso momento se dijo a si mismo que debía dejar de pensar en Elizabeth de esa manera . Como si fuera alguién que le gustaba. Bueno era cierto que lo hacía pero todo se debía a que ella lo rechazaba. Sabia que era estúpido pero quizás se parecía más a su madre de lo que creyera. Ella había amado a Paddy, y a él le gustaba una mujer que lo prefería lejos. Era solo que... había sido muy agradable la noche anterior. Elizabeth Cavendish con un trago encima era una mujer encantadora, al menos para él. Además se había visto hermosa con aquél uniforme de la orquesta, sencillo y oscuro había resaltado la palidez de su rostro, su cabello también oscuro le recordaban al personaje de Merlina Adams, de la mejor manera posible. Eso era todo, solo una velada, una vaga conversación que le había quitado varios pesos de encima. ¿Era normal cierto? Conocer mejor a alguién que siempre te había ignorado, para precisamente, en ese momento entender que no era del todo desagradable. Que ni ella ni él se detestaban, que ella tal vez podía no temerle, y él, a su vez, dejar de ser intimidante a su lado. Estaba exagerando, ella no le gustaba. Simplemente le había sorprendido. Esa jornada tenía pensado pasarla en el gimnasio. El día anterior, mientras él y Godmann preparaban las instalaciones para el evento de música, se había saltado su régimen diario. Lo hacía en ocasiones, cuando una buena paga se acercaba o, en su defecto, John le rogaba. Pete \"Mad Dog\" Grimes estaba ahí cuando llegó. Colt´s, antes había sido su gimnasio, el terreno en donde el perro loco cazaba, había sido el favorito de Boyd y su campeón para el Sparta. Hasta que él llegó. Ya había notado Tommy, que la polarización que causara su participación en Sparta dentro del gimnasio termino fundiéndose en algo similar al espíritu de equipo, los muchachos le apoyaban y Boyd que esperaba que ambos pudieran formar como mínimo una escuela de MMA con la intención clara de hacerse famoso y ganar más dinero. Obviamente, este había pensado que al apostar por dos participantes sus opciones de ganar aumentaban, sin embargo debió tragarse la decepción cuando aquello no ocurrió. Todo sin mencionar que en cuanto terminó el torneo, él fue entregado a las autoridades y luego de vuelta al ejercito para su juicio. Mientras que Mad Dog, se encontraba en rehabilitación. Tommy, que no ser caracterizaba por su benevolencia y, claramente en la jaula, la mínima consideración que pudiera tener por cualquier ser humano desaparecía. Todo eso sufrió Mad Dog bajo sus puños, con el no grato resultado de una mandíbula suelta así como la retina de su ojo derecho. Y si bien Pete no se quejaba de ello, todos sabían que había perdido una cantidad importante de auspiciadores. Pero como luchadores sabían los riesgos de la profesión, eso no quitaba que de vez en cuando el perro loco lo mirara con odio. De todas maneras se saludaron con respeto cuando se vieron. Las situaciones de ambos no eran muy diferentes, la condena en prisión pesaba en todos sus antecedentes así que, técnicamente, podría decirse que se encontraban temporal y obligatoriamente retirados. Sin embargo, no se engañaba y sería una tontería negar que de ambos era él quién mejores posibilidades tenía de continuar una carrera como luchador. Pete no parecía complicado con la faceta de entrenador aunque, según él, era demasiado tranquilo para su carácter y Tommy estaba de acuerdo con ello. Después de los saludos comenzaron las preguntas, aunque no todas iban dirigidas a Tommy. Jamás había sido bueno para interactuar con gente que no conociera. Obviamente a Pete lo conocía pero distaba mucho de tener confianza en él. Además era tenso encontrarse a su lado, no es que le importara claro. Aunque solía fastidiarle que cada cierto tiempo sacara a colación la situación de Brendan y la posibilidad patente de que él se había dejado ganar. Sin embargo, todas aquellos recuerdos se desvanecieron cuando un murmullo generalizado se apoderó del lugar. Tommy no necesito mirar para saber, era el efecto que Maggie conseguía cada vez que llegaba a Colt´s. — Una verdadera belleza — decía Grimes cada vez que la veía y no se preocupaba de ocultar su admiración. El perro loco olfateaba el aire como si se tratara de un pedazo de carne especialmente apetecible. Tommy estaba seguro que de tener cola esta se sacudiría con la fuerza de un huracán. Un equipo la seguía, de seguro nuevos auspiciadores la buscaban y no los culpaba. Maggie tenía todo lo necesario para ser la chica más popular de la secundaria algo que irónicamente, según ella, no le había ocurrido cuando la cursara. Fiel a su forma de ser saludó casi alegre a todos los presentes. Vestía formal, señal clara de que venía de alguna reunión importante, su cabello usualmente recogido en una apretada trenza estaba suelto y ondulado y a él no le quedó más que aceptarlo; Maggie lucia hermosa, su cabeza le recordó el sueño de la mañana en donde ella lo montaba como a un corcel y algo parecido a la incomodidad le hizo mirar hacia el exterior. — Señores — saludó la chica al pasar al lado del grupo. Todos asintieron en vano ya que los ojos de la chica no se despegaron de Tommy, quien no lo notó, puesto que su atención se desvió cuando vio llegar a Michael Cavendish. — ¡¿Que demonios te pasa hombre?! — le interrumpió Grimes golpeándolo con suavidad en el brazo una vez que Maggie se alejara. Tommy se giró hacia él sin entender. — ¿De que? — Boyd negó y volvió la vista hacia donde la atención de Tommy había estado pero no dijo nada. — Maggie, esa chica te dejaría hacer lo que quisieras — no le quedó más que sonreír, la recordaba besándolo como si él fuera lo único importante en el mundo. Y no dijo nada. — Al menos deberías invitarla a salir — agregó Boyd, con un tono completamente casual. Se imagino así mismo en la barra de un bar, Maggie luciría un vestido que resaltara todos sus atributos, haciéndole sentirse afortunado por estar con ella. \"Ahora lo sabes\" — Tal vez lo haga — dijo sin siquiera mirar a la muchacha. Algo más dijeron Grimes y Boyd, pero no les prestó atención. En cambio se dirigió hacia Michael, quién tranquilo como siempre, le tendió la mano cuando lo saludó. — ¿Quienes hacer sparring conmigo? — el muchacho solo asintió. Al mirarlo, observarlo por primera vez Tommy vio en el los ojos y la nariz de Elizabeth. Maria, la hija de Manny, se parecía más a su padre que a Pilar, por el contrario Genaro era la viva imagen de Pilar. No entendía porque esas ideas cruzaban su cabeza, solo que al verlo Tommy se dijo que ambos debían lucir más como su padre. Algo que, no supo porque, lo llevo a pensar en Brendan y en él. Ninguno lucía como Paddy, él sabía que se parecía más a su abuelo, y Brendan tenía los ojos y labios de su madre. \"Los dos nos saltamos al viejo\" Michael era un luchador tranquilo y metódico. Frank Campana habría estado feliz con él, sabía tomarse sus tiempos y esperar, algo que le sacaba de sus casillas y a Boyd también. Además de ello, era demasiado temerario -algo que incluso había visto en él mismo- ya que tanta tolerancia a golpes y ataques, no solo volvían aburridas sus peleas, sino que demostraban que el muchacho no sabía cuantificar el daño que recibía. Tommy había escuchado sobre una enfermedad al sistema nervioso que impedía que las personas sintieran dolor o se percataran de los cambios muy drásticos de temperatura. No creía que Michael fuera uno de ellos, pero la calma que mantenía durante los combates solía hacerle dudar. Ya, en dos ocasiones Colt debió cargar con él hasta el Ohio Valley Hospital Central de Pittsburg. Debido a su mal entendimiento de lo que era aquél deporte. Aún así no lo juzgaba, lo había visto antes en muchachos inexpertos con demasiadas ganas. Después de que su regreso, Boyd le encargó entrenar al muchacho. Mostarle lo que realmente era ser un luchador. Tommy no entendía en que parte de ello eso era algo que él podía hacer. Pero accedió. Y no se arrepentía de ello, a pesar de su imprudencia Michael tenía buenos reflejos y velocidad. Lo que resultaba perfecto para él, puesto que en esos momentos lo único que le interesaba era mantener un bajo perfil. John le ayudó con su primer trabajo, mientras volvía a ponerse en forma en Colt´s. De todas maneras al principio tuvo que dar muchas entrevistas, lo que atrajo la fama necesaria al gimnasio para que una chica como Maggie, campeona nacional y muy popular en aquél deporte, se decidiera por aquél tugurio, tugurio que a su vez creció en miembros y mejoró sus instalaciones cuando él, Grimes y Greene eran parte de sus filas. Bueno, Michael había llegado ahí por él, si es que era verdad lo que Elizabeth decía. Una vez se toparon en las duchas Tommy fijó su atención en el muchacho, de nuevo, silencioso y ágil. Realmente era como si lo notara por primera vez. Nunca antes se había fijado en aquellos detalles. Llevaban casi un año de conocerse. \"Ahora lo sabes\" — Ayer me topé a tu hermana en el trabajo — dijo casual. Michael fijó sobre él una mirada seria y desinteresada. — Me lo dijo — contestó — fue una noche movida contó — Tommy apretó una toalla con su mano, las imágenes del rostro de la muchacha golpeada llegaron a su cabeza y como es que Elizabeth le había mirado con aprobación cuando se acercó a ellas. — ¿Te dijo lo que ocurrió? — el muchacho negó. — No se sentía bien hoy, no hablamos mucho — aquello captó de inmediato su atención. — ¿Le... le ocurrió algo? — Michael recogió su bolso y volteó hacia él. — Creo que se quedo esperando mucho rato el autobus — se encogió de hombros como si no le importara — si quieres puedes ir a verla. Cuando la llamé antes de venir acá me dijo que estaría en casa — Tommy bajo la vista. — Esta bien, si se siente enferma no me gustaría llegar a molestar, es mejor que descanse. — Como quieras — finalizó el muchacho. Tommy no debió mirarlo para saber que se había retirado. Solo bastó el ruido de la puerta de las duchas para asegurarlo. Cierto, aquella otra vez tampoco lo había notado. De hecho, estaba seguro de que visualizó un edificio y no una casa con jardín y todo. Había decoraciones navideñas bastante escuetas a las que recientemente se les había sacado la nieve, aún así seguían siendo mejores que las inexistentes en la casa de Paddy. Pero era su culpa, su padre le había sugerido hacer algo diferente este año, pero Tommy trabajaría durante la noche buena, por lo que alegó que era innecesario molestarse. También trabajó durante la fiesta de acción de gracias. Y su padre Paddy... Paddy Conlon se había quedado esperando alguna invitación de Brendan que nunca llegó. Era tan o más extraño que la relación que ellos llevaban. Puesto que ambos habían cedido, los gestos de Paddy hacia él eran cada vez menos, mientras que él dejaba de tratarlo con frialdad. Funcionaba. Podían estar varios días tranquilos. Pero con Brendan, había algo más ahí que Tommy no sabía si le interesaba saber. \"Debería hacerlo, es mi hermano... \" Pero luego recordaba a Manny, y sabía que él si era su hermano. No estaba pero habría sido el hermano que siempre quiso tener. Al único que había querido. Querido... No, lo mejor era retirarse. Siquiera sabía porque había ido ahí. \"¿Que le puede pasar entre la acera y la puerta de su casa?\" Enfermarse, al parecer. Aunque él la había visto la noche anterior, pantalones empapados y zapatos de gala cerrados. De seguro imaginó que le serviría para combatir el frío, pero al igual que él, quizás tampoco imagino que estarían casi una hora parados esperando que algún auto bus apareciera. Negó, no tenía nada que hacer ahí en ese momento. Se giró con toda la intención de seguir de largo, cuando dos botas oscuras retrocedieron junto a él. Bastó solo una ojeada para saber que se trataba de ella. \"¿Esta de nuevo huyendo?\" Llevaba una bolsa de papel, de la cual sobresalían un baguette y el borde de una caja de galletas o pastelillos, conocía la marca pero no podía ver nada más. — ¿Como estás Tommy? — y recordó que la tarde anterior también se habían encontrado y que ella, tratando de tranquilizarse y no huir le había preguntado lo mismo. Asintió antes de contestar. — Bien, Michael me dijo que habías enfermado — para confirmar aquello Elizabeth Cavendish estornudó y rápidamente se limpió con un pañuelo arrugado. Tenía la nariz roja, al igual que los ojos lo que los volvía más oscuros. Ella sintió sin mirarlo, aunque cuando alzó la vista le sonrió. Y no con gesto cansado o como resultado de su enfermedad, tampoco era serio o pensativo, o resignado si no que realmente era un gesto alegre, como si le hubieran contado un buen chiste o si hubiera visto algo gracioso, o algo que le hiciera sentirse feliz. — Es cierto, me va mal en esta época — y sin decir más siguió su camino. Como estúpido Tommy se quedó en la acera observándola. Elizabeth se detuvo y giró hacia él. — ¿No vienes? — completamente extrañado la siguió. El camino empedrado que daba hacia la entrada de la casa de Elizabeth había sido barrido con sal recientemente, el olor lo decía. La pequeña escalinata también era de piedra ¿Sería de ellos aquél lugar? — ¿Rentas? — preguntó antes de pensar bien que decir. Elizabeth negó. — Nos la heredó nuestra abuela hace un par de años, la rentamos durante algunos meses — estornudó y volvió a limpiarse, comenzó a buscar su juego de llave y alzó la pierna para apoyar la bolsa. En aquél momento Tommy se acercó y le pareció extraño que ella no deseara retroceder. — Te ayudo — dijo y ella volvió a sonreírle sin gesto alguno de desenfado, miedo, timidez o molestia. Nada, su sonrisa le parecía genuina y al verla nuevamente no pudo evitar sentir algo raro en su estómago. — Gracias — cuando finalmente pudo abrir la puerta, Tommy la siguió al interior de su casa. Un pequeño recibidor tenía una miniatura de árbol de navidad solamente decorado con objetos plateados sin luces o adorno adicional alguno. Tommy también notó que no tenía estrella. En una mesa en donde Elizabeth dejó las llaves había un gato gris y gordo, que perezoso siquiera despertó cuando ambos entraron. Ella lo acarició completamente desinteresada y continuó hacia el interior. Volvió a estornudar mientras él la seguía a lo que parecía la cocina, la muchacha encendió algunas luces, todas eran cálidas. El piso era de parque, pero tenía bastas alfombras, la mayoría negras y rojas. El comedor y la sala de estar estaban separados por un pasillo abierto que daba directamente a la cocina. Todo lucía ordenado pero descuidado al mismo tiempo, como si en ella vivieran dos adolescentes. Vio un Cello y una guitarra, así como pesas para los brazos al lado de uno de los sofás y un bolso que identificó de Michael. — Puedes dejar las cosas ahí — señaló ella hacia la mesa principal de la cocina —¿Quieres un té o un café? — Tommy se quedó observándola mientras encendía la cocina ¿Estaba siendo encantadora nuevamente? no lo parecía, no le había dicho mucho aunque el día anterior tampoco había sido un derroche de elocuencia. — Café estará bien — contestó tranquilizándose, debía dejar de pensar estupideces. Ella se le quedó observando. — ¿Puedes beberlo? — preguntó realmente intrigada. Tommy asintió, no entendía el porque de su pregunta. Ella se encogió de hombros y preparó una taza. El calor del lugar comenzó a subirle por las piernas y a bajar por su rostro. Era agradable, era algo a lo que le gustaría acostumbrarse, solo que cuando llegaba a su casa, generalmente Paddy estaba durmiendo o con sus audiolibros. Se sacó la gorra. — ¿Por que no debería? — Michael no lo bebe, dice que no es una dieta adecuada para un deportista — era cierto aunque Paddy jamás le había quitado el café cuando lo entrenara. — Tiene razón — agregó y cuando ella le extendió el brebaje él solo dijo — quizás no soy buen deportista. — Nadie es perfecto — concordó ella. El silencio inundo el lugar de la nada. Y Tommy volvió a sentirse como cada vez que se encontraba con ella. Quizás debería irse. De la nada su cabeza comenzó a decirle que estaba haciendo el ridículo ahí. Por lo que, en silencio, bebió el café lo más rápido que pudo. — Debo irme — dijo casi disculpándose, consiguiendo que ella se fijara en él otra vez. — ¿No esperarás a Michael? — preguntó de inmediato ella. Logrando que algunas piezas encajaran en la cabeza de Tommy. — No vine por Michael — y no fue necesario decir nada más para que la sorpresa se pintara evidente como un anuncio en Times Square en el rostro de Elizabeth. — Creí que... — Lo sé — y sintiéndose realmente incómodo y estúpido Tommy procedió a salir de aquél laberinto en el cual se había transformado el hogar de los Cavendish. En esa ocasión fue ella quién lo sorprendió cuando lo alcanzó, la mano de Elizabeth era firme y tenía callosidades en la punta de sus dedos, aún así su tacto fue agradable y cálido en aquella parte en la cual sus guantes no le cubrían. — Tommy — le dijo, mientras le cogía de la mano. El se volteó y ella se le quedó mirando — gracias — agregó con la misma suavidad y tranquilidad con la cual le cogiera. Él solo asintió, esta vez tranquilo y cuando ella le soltó, sin decir nada más se retiró. — Habrá un evento de la Universidad de Pittsburgh durante noche buena ¿Te interesa? — mentalmente Tommy se recordó que Colt´s estaría cerrado. No sabía que haría Paddy, pero dudaba que se dedicara a cocinar algo. Además ya le había dicho que trabajaría, aún cuando no tenía plan alguno por lo que el ofrecimiento de John le pareció perfecto para su actual situación. \"¿Que situación es esa? que no quieres estar con tu padre\" ¿Lo invitará Brendan esta vez? Quizás, como nunca, debería contactarse con su hermano. Algo le estaba comenzando a decir que no estaba bien, que Paddy tenía el derecho a pasar más tiempo con su hijo, no con él, claro. Sino con Brendan, con Brendan y su familia, Tess y las niñas. Tommy asintió mientras sacaba su equipo del casillero. Cerró su gaveta y giró hacia John. — ¿Cuanto la hora? — preguntó. — 22 dólares, con el mismo grupo del concierto de la semana pasada — le parecía bien, si hacía un turno doble podía obtener hasta 350 dolares, era cierto que obtenía más en algunas peleas, pero costaba demasiado encontrarle un contrincante. — Perfecto ¿Donde será? — En el Heinz Hall, si quieres el turno de 16 horas, tendrás que llegar a las 07:00 a.m. — Tommy aceptó todo, ya que no tenía plan alguno para hacer aquella noche. Comprar regalos ¿A quién? ¿A su padre, a Brendan? quizás debería tener algo para las niñas. Eran sus sobrinas después de todo. \"¿Por que me muestras fotografías de gente que no conozco?\" Había sonado tan lleno de rencor, y cada vez que las palabras se repetían en su cabeza el odio parecía teñirlas. Quizás debería conocerlas, quizás debería intentar conocerlas. Manny ya no estaba, los que estaban eran Paddy, Brendan y las niñas. \"Quizás un regalo a Elizabeth\" Que idiotez, ¿Que podría darle? sabía tan poco de ella y menos de sus gustos. Sabía que no le gustaba el combate y asumió que aquella era la razón por la cual jamás entraba a Colt´s, siempre se quedaba fuera esperando a Michael, aunque quizás era porque le temía a él. No lo sabía, llevaba una semana sin verla, tal vez desde aquél gracias en la casa de ella, Elizabeth había cambiado su forma de pensar respecto a él. \"Una semana entera\" Cuando se despidió de John confirmó su asistencia al Heinz Hall para nochebuena, sería una buena paga y realmente mientras no hubieran niños -idea que no pasaba mucho por su cabeza- no había razón alguna para pasarlo en familia . \"Quizás un regalo a Pilar y a los niños\" Eso le convencía más, de hecho si en aquél momento iba al centro comercial más cercano el Ross Park Mall podría enviarlos ese mismo día y Pilar y los niños recibirían sus regalos dentro de la víspera. Además sabía mucho más de sus gustos que de los de Elizabeth o su padre. Nunca le habían agradado las aglomeraciones de personas, principalmente por el ruido. Después de Irak, Tommy apreciaba como nadie el silencio. En ocasiones podía escuchar alguna canción o melodía, pero no soportaba las discoteques o pub´s con música en vivo, que decir de los conciertos. Era una de las razones por las cuales John había comenzado a llevarlo a eventos más calmados; beneficiencias, fiestas de alguna revista de moda, desfiles y conciertos pequeños como el de la semana anterior. Aún así se sintió incómodo cuando llego al centro comercial. No era, en lo absoluto, buena idea el ir de compras una semana antes de Navidad. El gentío era demasiado, lo que le mareaba. Y, le resultó bastante complicado el encontrar a primera vista una tienda de juguetes para los niños. Aunque, al menos Genaro, ya no estaba en edad de seguir recibiendo juguetes. Recordaba que el hobby de Maria era dibujar, y el del muchacho los autos. Sin embargo de los diez a los doce años mucho cambia. Lo mejor, en ese caso, sería ropa y a la pequeña un libro de ilustraciones para pintar. El dividir aquellas ideas le alentó, podría salir con dos regalos aceptables sin tener que lidiar durante muchas horas con todo el gentío. Sin mucho preámbulo buscó la primera librería que encontró Amazing Books; una tienda con dos pisos de llenos de libros, que a su vez también se encontraba llena de niños. Al final de las estanterías más pequeñas en donde, de seguro, estaban los libros de niños; una chica muy guapa leía un cuento a varios pequeños que la escuchaban atentos. Llevaba un vestido de elfo de Navidad y parecía encantada. Desvió la vista cuando ella la fijó en él y le sonrió para seguir su camino y buscar el regalo de Maria. Eligió tres libros diferentes; dos con ilustraciones infantiles y uno con dibujos más intricados y detallados, sería un buen paso para, si es que a María le interesaba, mejorar su técnica. Ir de lo simple a lo más complicado. Hizo la fila para pagar y fijó la vista más allá del ventanal de la entrada. Justo enfrente había una tienda de equipamiento deportivo, pero desecho la idea de comprarse algo al recordar que aún le faltaba el regalo de Genaro, no le agradaba la el tener que buscar una tienda con ropa para niños, pero se hizo a la idea. Fue cuando la conversación llegó a sus oídos. — Michael tiene el potencial para ser el mejor... el Colt´s claro que podrán sacarle el provecho para convertirlo en una máquina, pero tú sabes que él necesita más — era obvio que hablaban de Cavendish. ¿Por que los Cavendish le seguían? Después de la última semana sin toparse con Elizabeth había podido controlar la necesidad de ir a ver si es que se encontraba bien. Se había sentido estúpido la última vez y eso le ayudó a sobreponerse a la necesidad. Sin embargo que el nombre del muchacho saliera justo ahí, en donde era casi imposible encontrárselo era un fastidio. Sobre todo porque no le gustaba lidiar con la idea de que Elizabeth le gustaba. Él sabía que lo hacía pero también sabía que no era algo simple, a penas le conocía a penas había hablado con ella. — Es cierto — contestó ¿como no?; ella, consiguiendo que volteara y los viera; tres o cuatro personas más atrás de él. El sujeto debía ser un gerente de gimnasio Tommy lo había visto muchas veces pero no podía recordar su nombre, solía ocurrir que en ocasiones ofrecían mejores ofertas a los peleadores por representarlos. Esa sonrisa, fuera de molestarle le recordaba a algo a alguien solo que no podía asegurar a quién. Era obvio que se trataba de alguién relacionado al mundo de las peleas, ¡Si, fue en el Sparta! — De todas maneras no es mi decisión ¿Quieres que Michael valla a Philadephia? tienes que llevarte a Tommy Riordan contigo — ¡Ya lo sabía! era Frank Campana, el entrenador de Brendan. Por supuesto que Campana buscaría a alguien como Michael, incluso eso era algo que él podía vaticinar. \"Tommy Riordan\" Lo vio negar. — Tommy es una bestia sin control — dijo — no puedo llevarme a alguien así a mi gimnasio — fue el momento en que él volvió la vista hacia la fila, esta avanzaba y no lo estaba esperando. — No es así — escuchó de pronto — puede parecerlo pero no es una bestia. — ¿Hablas con él? — y el tono de Frank tenía un aire gracioso que no le agradaba en lo absoluto. — No tanto como quisiera... — ¿Como quisieras? — y un silencio rodeó esa conversación. Elizabeth carraspeó. — Me refiero a que no es alguien con quién se pueda hablar mucho, es muy introvertido. — Si conocieras a su padre lo entenderías — finalizó Campana. Fue en ese momento en el cual él debió pagar en la caja. $22,15 y agregó un juego de crayolas, se lo envolvieron adecuadamente y se retiró. En ningún momento notó que tanto ella como Frank le habían visto al salir, ni al silencio incomodo que los rodeó al mirarse. N/A: Amazing Books , no se encuentra en Ross Park Mall . Es una tienda independiente mucho más pequeña a la descrita y ubicada en otro lugar. A todos quienes visitaron la historia; porque si, ¡Los ví! gracias. Aunque estaría más agradecida si es que alguno dejara un review. En fin, espero este capitulo fuera de su agrado. Saludos. Brujhah.

Tommy había notado con mol"},{"Movie":"Warrior, 2011","Title":"The Hope Candle","Author":"Mals86","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10921852","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A very merry Christmas to you. This one is particularly for my ladies, Wynter S Komen and Nik216, but blessings on you all. 862 days. Paddy kept a running count in his head as well as on the calendar in the kitchen. Sometimes the number didn't even matter, and the real value was living every minute sober and aware of the simple pleasures: hot coffee, clean clothes, a sunset. Some days he could only get through by distracting himself from the scarcity and the smallness of those pleasures. The best way he'd found so far to distract himself from all he didn't have were those books on tape. Classics, mostly – he'd worked his way through War and Peace and The Scarlet Letter , and he'd just started Moby Dick , which was a huge honker of a novel. It might even get him through to midsummer. But today was Christmas Eve, and he needed every one of those 862 days, needed to feel the weight of them underneath him, building him a bridge leading out of the hell his life had become. He'd finally hit bottom two summers ago. It hadn't been anything so prosaic as wrecking his car or losing his job. Instead, he'd lost the only family he had left. He'd lost his son. He'd lost his patient, stubbornly loving, long-suffering Brendan. Brendan never liked to lose his temper – a characteristic he shared with his mother – but once his anger was roused it was implacable, unappealable. Cold and hard as ice. And Paddy was out in the cold, utterly alone. He'd been so shocked when he'd called to make amends and Brendan had laid out the rules for him. \"I don't want to see you, Pop. I don't want you around. I can't have you near my family.\" \" I'm your family, son,\" Paddy had protested, cut to the heart. \"It's not safe for them. I have to protect my wife and my children. You never did that. Ever. And now I see you're never gonna change.\" All the icy winds of a miserable Pittsburgh winter were in his son's voice, and even from three hundred miles away, Paddy shivered. \"You've hurt the people you say you love a million times. I'm done, Pop. I'm done cleaning up after you, I'm done covering for you. I'm done with trying to stand between you and the problems caused by your drinking. I'm done caring.\" \"I'm sorry,\" Paddy cried out, fear lancing through his body. Not again, he couldn't lose people he loved again. \"No, Pop. I'm done. I swear, if I see you coming around this house, coming around my family with your alcohol and your rage, I will call the cops.\" The finality in his voice, the certitude, was convincing. Paddy looked into the future, endless days of grief and loneliness, and whispered to himself, \"What'll I do?\" \"I don't give a shit,\" Brendan said. And then he'd sighed, heavily. \"No. Pop, if you really need something, you can call me. Or write me. But only if you really need something. Are we clear?\" Paddy couldn't speak. Brendan repeated himself, his voice harder. \"Are we clear?\" Crystal. And now it had been almost two and a half years since Paddy's drinking had shattered his last family tie, and every day since then he'd spent trying to clean himself up, trying to make a foundation on which he could stand when he reached out for his family. Every day not drinking, all eight hundred and sixty-two of them, was a plank in the bridge he was building back to Brendan. He'd made himself a promise: he'd earn a thousand days of sobriety before he reached for Brendan again. He'd prove that this time, he was serious about giving up the booze. He'd go see Brendan then. No more sending Christmas and birthday cards in the mail with only the hope that he'd receive a letter back, no more messages left on Brendan's answering machine. Maybe he'd get to see the girls again. Maybe he'd reach out to Tommy too, when he had that good solid number under his belt. Maybe warm-hearted little Tommy would be able to see the way he'd changed his life, and forgive him. Paddy thought of the feel of Tommy's young shoulders under his hands, thin but alive with muscle, and his chest ached. Paddy wondered for the hundredth time if Tommy was still in the Corps. Was he deployed? Was he stationed at Camp Pendleton? Was Tommy looking out on a Christmas Eve as gray as the one outside here, or was it sunny in California? Was it hot in the desert, or cold in the mountains? Paddy had half a mind to call that private investigator back and hire him to locate Tommy. He could afford it; it had been truly surprising to him how fast the money piled up in his bank account, now that he wasn't spending it on the drink. It had been nice to spruce up the living room last summer, when he'd finally seen the dents in the walls and the grungy carpet. He'd picked subdued and manly colors for the room, nothing that reminded him of Mary Frances. No blue and white, no Madonna colors, nothing that would make him think of how badly he'd hurt her and how big a hole there was in the world, with her gone. Paddy had sent Brendan the results of the PI's investigation: Mary Frances dead and buried in Tacoma, not two years after she'd left him, and little Tommy joined the Marines right out of high school. Paddy had asked for a second set of the documents the PI gave him, and he'd bundled them up and sent them in a big manila envelope to Brendan. Brendan had actually called him then, and Paddy's heart had leaped so high when he heard Brendan's voice on the phone. But Brendan had asked his questions and Paddy had answered them, and that had been the end of the conversation. Was that all? Brendan had wanted to know. Where was his mother buried? And where was Tommy now, was he married, did he have children, was he still in the Corps? That's all, Paddy had told him. It was enough for him. It was enough to know that Mary Fran was beyond his reach now, and the only way he could make amends to her was in heaven (which meant that he'd better damn well do some penance, if he wanted to see her). It was enough to know that the Corps was looking after Tommy. Paddy made the mistake of admitting to Brendan that he was pleased about Tommy's career path. \"A Marine just like his old man,\" he'd said to Brendan, sure that Brendan would be as proud as Paddy was. \"If anybody was born to be a Marine, it's your brother.\" Brendan had immediately hung up without saying goodbye, and Paddy's heart had sunk. But it was a good choice for Tommy, Paddy had reflected many times. He'd always known Tommy would make a good Marine. Tommy had good tolerance for repetition and hard work, and he could follow orders well. Tommy gave his best effort, always. Why, if he was still active, he might even be a sergeant by now. Paddy came back to the present to wash his supper dishes and straighten up the place. That was another of the small pleasures he valued now, order after years of clutter and mess when Mary Fran wasn't around to redd up the house. He looked around the living room, at all the pictures he'd framed and set up around the room. Even with all the photos, the room seemed bare. Well, it was Christmas, but there was nothing in Paddy Conlon's empty house to show how grateful he was for the birth of his Savior. In the lost years, the ones he'd spent deep in the bottle, he hadn't bothered with decorating. Christmas was one more, excruciatingly painful, reminder of how much he'd lost, and he just couldn't bear it. Even now he thought of those Christmas decorations in boxes in the basement as belonging to Mary Fran. He couldn't look at that corner of the basement without remembering her, happy as a child, pulling strings of lights and crocheted snowflakes and red-and-green tea towels out of those boxes. Mary Frances, with her gray eyes sparkling and her cheeks pink, setting up the crèche on top of the desk. He suddenly wanted to see those things again – just objects, just stuff, but what a glow of their former owners they carried. He went down to the basement and opened the boxes, looking for the Nativity set, intending to bring that upstairs. But once he'd gotten into the boxes, he kept finding happy memories in them: Brendan's handprint ornament from kindergarten, the paper-plate Advent wreaths the boys made in Sunday School, the faded I LOV YU POP construction-paper card with Santa and angel stickers and a carefully-printed TOMMY in green crayon on the inside. His mother's favorite fruitcake tin. Mary Fran's Christmas dishes. The electric candle she used to put up in the front window, to welcome the Holy Family. I've lost all of them, he thought. This is all I have left, photos and memories. Well, then. If he had to live in the past, he would pick the happy times to remember. He set up the tree and decorated it with the strings of big colored lights and the ragged tinsel garland. He put the Nativity set on the desk, placing each figure just so. He put the candle in the window and turned it on. Then he sat in his chair and looked at the room, at the ghosts in it. There was Mary Fran, a baby in one arm and one growing under her apron. There she was in a red dress for Midnight Mass, buttoning little Tommy's coat and making sure Brendan had a hat on. There were the boys, sleepy-eyed and blinking as they watched their mother set the Baby Jesus figure in the middle of the crèche. And there were the boys, eyes shining on Christmas mornings at the gifts under the tree. There was Brendan as a fifth-grader, hanging a pinecone birdseed ornament he'd made in Cub Scouts, and there was nine-year-old Tommy, not to be outdone, running into the room to hang his first Junior Olympics medal on the tree too. There were all the Christmases Paddy had seen in this house, buzzed or begrudgingly sober. He'd never raised his hand to Mary Frances on Christmas, not that he could recollect, and Christmas Eves had always been a time for his family, back in those days before Mary Fran and Tommy left. He closed his eyes, just for a moment, and he could almost hear their voices. Then it was time for Mass. He shrugged on his coat and hat and went out to the Olds. She was still running pretty good, and her paintwork was still fresh, but she'd need an oil change soon as the first of the year rolled around. He'd get on it. He was almost late, and St. Lawrence O'Toole's was full up when he slipped in the door with another straggler. He managed to squeeze into the end of a crowded pew, right before the processional started, and he sat through the Mass with his same ghosts in his head, seeing his wife and his boys at different times over the years. All right, so maybe he was Ebenezer Scrooge, seeing the error of his ways and hoping it wasn't too late. It couldn't be too late. God wasn't that cruel. So they said at AA, and Paddy had decided to believe it. This sobriety thing, he needed it so badly. It had to work out. He had to get his sons back. So he went to his meetings and he stayed out of bars and he felt the pain of his past when he could bear it, and he distracted himself with his books on tape when he couldn't bear it anymore. And he counted the days. Eight hundred and sixty-two, thank you Jesus. No, it was Christmas Day now – eight hundred and sixty- three. He was one day closer to that crucial thousand days of sobriety. He watched the Advent candles lit: hope, faith, joy, and love, followed by the Christ candle, light of the world. He listened to the old story again: the journey, the stable, the labor, the baby, the shepherds and angels, the star. He sang the songs and prayed the prayers, and something that was not quite gratitude and not quite fear stirred inside him. It wasn't until he got home and saw the candle shining in his window that he understood it to be hope. \"Holy Mary,\" he prayed, kneeling there on the dull brown carpet near the window, \"you lost your son. You know that pain. And I've lost not one, but both of my sons. I know I don't deserve your favor… I know it's my fault I've lost them… but please, Mary, let us find our way back to each other. Help me be a worthy father this time. It'll take patience and time, but I love my boys. Open their hearts to me. I'll make you a novena every month so you'll know I mean it. Please, Holy Mother. Bring them back to me.\" He wasn't sure, later, how long he knelt in prayer, repeating what even he could see was a selfish plea, but it was a long time. Most of the houses on Hillcrest Street were dark when he finished with an Amen and wiped his eyes. His knees creaked when he stood up. He stood looking at the candle in the window for a moment longer. Nothing had changed on the surface. He was still an old grunt with busted knees and a weakness for the bottle, he knew that, but something had changed. In his heart, if nowhere else. He felt, somehow, answered . This might be the year that the Conlons would all be together again. \"May it be so,\" he whispered into the early, early Christmas morning. And a benediction fell like snow, peace settled like a warm blanket over him. Hope filled his heart. Paddy Conlon left the candle burning and went to bed.[Chapter 2] I know, I know… what am I doing updating a completed story? Confusing. However, bear with me a minute. I wanted to explain that I would be removing most of my multi-chapter fics from this site. The reason is that one of my bestest writer-buddies, Wynter S. Komen, just found out that someone had STOLEN her story, \"In the Land of Gods and Monsters,\" changed some details, and published it as a Kindle ebook. For sale. For money . In fact, not one but two different people (or the same person with two different pen names) stole her story and published it, and profited from someone else's work. And while I am beyond grateful to Fanfiction for providing a platform and an outlet for those of us who love stories to share them, free, out of our hearts, I'm no longer willing to risk having stories stolen and sold. I will be leaving my profile here, as well as my two short fics and the first chapters of my longer fics, but everything else will be removed. I'm sorry. I'm hurt, too. I am proud of these stories I've posted here, and sad that they're going to be tucked away and not read anymore. I know that if you've come here to read this story, you're disappointed too. I am still enormously glad that I've met so many terrific readers and writers here, and I am thankful every day that I met Wynter S. Komen and Nik216 here. It was on Fanfiction that we met and began corresponding, and began a triumvirate focused on encouragement and improving our writing, and now the three of us are ready to begin careers as writers. This is a huge deal for us, and someday I hope to announce that we have secured publishing contracts. I will not be posting any new stories or resurrecting the ones I've removed. I feel that this chapter of my writing life has closed – and we all know that feeling, don't we? Where you're satisfied by the happily-ever-after part but sad that it's finally arrived. I want to wish you all continued happy reading on this site. If you'd like to contact me, please do – I will be reachable at wynn AT wynnguthrie DOT com (sorry about the bot-defeating strategy there). ","Summary":" A very merry Christmas to you.

He tries not to show Brendan, becuase he feels guilty enough about that anyway. He takes the painkillers the doctors gave him for bad days, becuase he's actually not an addict, and Brendan gets that, even if Paddy didn't. He makes Brendan keep him in their medicine cabinet anyway though, so he has to ask him or Tess for them. Brendan always gives him them with such an expression of remorse on his face that most of the time he'd rather ask Tess. She just gives him one then feels his forehead and makes sure he doesn't have a fever, and asks if he wants the heating pad. She tucks him in on the couch under the old Steelers blanket and turns the television on for him low, and the heat and the meds usually knock him out good. Sometimes he'll hear her and Brenden talking about him, in low voices. Something about trying long term meds again, or going to the doctor. He thinks he should have an opinion about this, but in all honesty, he doesn't know what to do. He's never really had anyone care about him being in pain before. Sometimes Brendan comes and sits on the edge of the couch, when he thinks he's still asleep. He'll put a hand on his forehead and whisper, \"I'm sorry.\" He never opens his eyes, but he wishes he could tell Brendan what an idiot he's being. The shoulder doesn't matter that much. His big brother just took him in, and put him up, and got him on his feet again. He didn't think that a bum shoulder was too high a price to pay for that.[Chapter 2] Snow Tess shook her head as she watched Tommy and Brendan, trying to remember when exactly shoveling the walkway for her and the girls had turned into a full blown snowball fight. Presently Tommy was winning, but Brendan was managing to trudge through the onslaught until he had both his hands on his brother's jacket and then managed to flip Tommy into the snowdrift behind him. Tommy was wilier than he'd given him credit for, and he hooked an ankle around Brendan's feet, taking him with him. Tess shook her head as they both popped up, Brendan slipping both his arms around his brother in half hug, half tackle. Tommy let out a noise that was something close to a yelp, though she was sure he would deny it later. She'd let him, just like she'd let Brendan deny the not so manly yell he gave when his little brother shoved snow down his back. She wondered what it was about some snow that turned her normally sober men into little boys. She shook her head as she went to get towels and a mat for the floor. She couldn't say she minded, not really. ","Summary":" Slight AU in which Tommy was discharged, not AWOL. Starts after they walk out of the ring.

The covers instantly became fire against his chilling body, and he dug the back of his head deeper into his pillow. The Pittsburgh hills were sadists at four-thirty in the morning, and the autumn breeze was anything but warm. Run. Run, Tommy. Do you want to win this match? Win it all? His father. Paddy Conlon: the steelworker who had more dedication to the Steel Workers' Union than to his own family. Unless it was wrestling. That was the one time Pop had his eyes on Tommy and Tommy alone. The one time he was proud of his son. Maybe it was the years that had made Paddy rough; or maybe it was the war. Whatever the case, there was no mercy left in the world for Tommy and Brendan Conlon, it seemed. What little mercy there was took form in the sport of wresting. It was the safe haven for the Conlon brothers. And that is why Tommy arose at four-thirty in the morning to run. At thirteen, he already felt drafted into the army. Paddy Conlon's army. And he was pretty goddamn sure it was worse than anything the United States military could come up with. Sighing, he drug his body out of the warm bed, drearily folding the sheets the way Pop liked it. The Terrible Towel seemed an ultra bright yellow in these wee hours of the morning, and the black letters seemed to taunt him. It wasn't that Tommy didn't love the sport, or tolerate the training. To him, it had become just another aspect of daily life. What got to him was the pressure. His father had a path set for him, and there was no option to explore the distant term 'personality'. What mattered was character ; how much a boy could take before he broke. That was all Tommy had ever grown up knowing. So, it was wrestle your way through high school, join the Marines, find a girl, stay close to home, become a steelworker, and maybe go to community college down the road. Plain and simple, that was his life; from teenage years to death. Tommy bit his cheek, turning to look at his brother still fast asleep. Brendan had learned years ago how to sleep through Tommy's ludicrous alarms, and as the younger brother stared at his roommate's sleeping form, he couldn't help but feel envy. The momentary recognition from Pop was not enough to justify sacrificing his entire life for wrestling. Brendan had the opportunity to find himself, and make his own way. Tommy had never experienced that luxury. He rubbed his temples as he felt his stomach growl. His first match was in fifty hours, and he was three pounds above his weight class; he couldn't afford to eat this morning. Pop would steam into a frenzy if he even caught Tommy sneaking a hard-boiled egg. To distract himself from the hunger, he grabbed his tennis shoes from beside the bed, slipping them on, not bothering to even retie the laces. Tom was careful to step down the stairs quietly, but just loud enough so his light sleeper of a father would know he was up and running. The burning desire to please Pop would never fade. No matter how many times he'd let down his sons. Tommy was still determined to make him proud; even if it was on his father's terms. Homestead was not the easiest of places to run around, but it was doable. Tommy Conlon had proved that many a time. Amongst the smokestacks, though rapidly diminishing and finding themselves being outsourced, the smoke was rough on the lungs. It was like inhaling one hundred cigarettes at once. Industrial cigarettes, full of god knows what. But that didn't stop Tommy from picking up a jog as he went down the massive hill also known as his street. The homes were still sleepy, only one or two lights on amongst all the houses. It was a Sunday, and not a single soul had the intention of starting the day extra early. Tommy as alright with the silence though. Out here, on the Pittsburgh streets this early, it was just him and his thoughts. Yes, the looming reminder of what was expected of him plagued the back of his mind, but he could silence it for a bit. Just long enough to keep him sane. Tommy thought about his brother still sound asleep at home, and picked up his pace. He was striding now, his arms extending to the point where he could feel the pull in the side of his back. His muscles were tight this morning, and his joints cracked groaningly as he continued down the street. Almost by the main street, he thought about picking up an energy bar at the local grocery store. The manager Gary offered him one every single time they crossed paths in the morning and Tommy looked hungry, but the boy always refused it. It wasn't his way, to take charity. No matter how desperately he wanted to. One thing Pop had taught him well was strength. Passing the grocery store, Tommy looked to see if Gary was opening up shop. But of course he wouldn't be. It was Sunday. Tom kept running, his arches feeling tenderer with each step he took. The sweat was beginning to pour now, as the sun rose higher in the sky, and his sweatshirt felt heavier and heavier. He was almost back to his house now, just one more hill to go. The Conlon's lived right at the tippy top of the mountainous street. It always gave Tommy the illusion there was a very long way to fall. He sprinted up the street, hoping silently that Pop would be sitting on the steps, or maybe Brendan. Tommy needed some form of recognition for what he was doing. Today, his wish seemed to be granted. Because there, on the highest of the three steps, sat his brother. Elbows resting on his thighs, and hands clasped together, Brendan looked pensive. Tommy slowed down when he reached his house, trying hard to regulate his breathing. He looked to his brother, silently asking what was wrong. The brothers had rarely ever needed words to communicate. \"Mom and Pop are fighting,\" Brendan said vacantly. \"Well, more like Mom is fighting with a human bottle of Yuengling.\" The fifteen year old was bitter to say the least. These fights were becoming more and more common, and the two brothers were becming more calloused to their affects. \"Oh,\" Tommy said in low disappointment. His breathing was almost at its normal pace now, and he took a heavy seat to the right of his brother. \"What's it about this time?\" \"God knows what,\" Brendan said dryly. \"They've been going at it for a while now.\" \"It's barely even six,\" Tommy replied distantly, wanting that energy bar more than anything now. \"Yeah, well, it doesn't seem like fighting has a nine to five work day,\" Brendan said. Tommy smirked at the comment, tapping his foot on the concrete stair. He wished he hadn't come home yet. \"Brendan, do you think we'll be here forever?\" Tommy's voice was small, childish whispers more than anything. Brendan looked to his brother confusedly. The boy still stared straight ahead, seeming to see beyond the rows of clustered homes, still partially covered in soot. \"What do you mean?\" \"Here; in this town; with Mom and Pop…\" Tommy didn't even have to finish his thought. Brendan knew what he was talking about. It was always the brothers' biggest fear to be landlocked in the crossfire of their parents, and everything it implied. Even surrounded by three rivers, the Conlon boys felt so far from water and freedom. \"I don't know, Tommy,\" Brendan replied. It wasn't a matter of getting out of Pittsburgh; it was the issue of losing the memory of their father. Tommy and Brendan made eye contact, seeing bits and pieces of Pop in each other. So, for now this will be a one shot unless I get an overwhelming request to expand it. (Or, if I have the desire on my own, haha). But I really love this movie, and feel it is underwritten, so I figured I'd take a stab at it. Please tell me how you think I did! Reviews are love![Chapter 2] World Made of Steel Two ' Slow Glowing Dream' It was eerily quiet now, and Tommy couldn't hear anything coming from behind the thin front door. Its bleak gray color gave no vibe of danger, yet no assurance of kindness either. He kicked at some of the gravel on the step, and caught Brendan's attention. The older boy looked at him wearily with a sigh. Tommy, no matter how much life pulled him down, always seemed to have this spark of life… no, it was more a sort of determination… that kept him going, no matter what. Brendan envied that will to survive: he'd never pegged himself as someone who had that endearing quality. Maybe that was why Pop had so much more faith in Tommy. His determination not to be beaten made him the perfect contender for both wrestling and the Marines. He didn't ask questions either, and by god, did Pop loathe questions. The army wouldn't stand for them, and neither would coaches or the mills; sure there was that illusion, but he knew it wasn't true. Brendan was too into bettering himself, and creating his own future. Tommy was Pop's little soldier; Brendan had never been that… probably never would. As long as Tommy was around, at least. Tapping his fingers on his knee, he kept his gaze on his brother; the younger boy didn't seem to notice. But Tommy missed very little, so he raised his eyes to Brendan. He looked so distant from invincible, that Brendan had to do a double take. Tommy's thick brown eyes were vacant, and a twinkle of sweat lingered on his long eyelashes—a kind of twinkle that made him appear more deadened than he truly was. Brendan almost shivered. It was rare that his brother ever looked like this. He wanted no more than to hug the boy, asking feverishly if everything was okay. But Tommy Conlon very rarely responded well to physical affection… any kind of affection for that matter. It was just who he was. Brendan bit his lip. \"Maybe we should go inside,\" he suggested quietly, picking up the pace of his taps upon his knee. Tommy stared at the nervous fingers, and looked back up. \"Mom and Pop,\" Tommy reminded just as meekly, and Brendan let out a deep breath, his fingers coming to a halt. \"Tom, we can't stay out here forever; we've got to go in at some point.\" It pained Brendan to say that, because he knew the probability of peace behind that gray door was very slim. Tommy dropped his brother's gaze. \"It's peaceful out here,\" he whispered, letting his eyes linger on the sleepy street. No one was being hurt out here; there was no pain. Nothing was broken, no hearts were shattering. Tommy wanted to stay out here forever; it wasn't like family meant much anyway. 'Conlon' was simply a name that bound him to a dutiful ache. \"Tommy—\" Brendan started, but the younger brother shook his head, getting up from his seat with such stealth agility, his brother had to hide his envy. Brushing the gravely substance off the back of his shorts, he twisted the door's knob harshly, and walked over the threshold with a certain heaviness. Brendan was left sitting there, utterly stunned. It took him a good few seconds to actually respond to reality, and then he too got up from his seat and followed Tommy inside. It was always like this: Tom silently leading, while Brendan humored himself with the illusion that he actually had a say. Tommy was frozen as he stood in the living room, looking like a stranger in his own home. Glass was shattered all over the unsavory mustard-yellow carpet, and there was sure to be the smell of alcohol if he knelt down near it. It looked as if water had been spilled; Pop was in his vodka phase, and it was not even seven in the morning. On a Sunday, no less. Jesus was nowhere to be seen, and salvation found no place in the deep crevices of their father's sins. Brendan stopped just behind his brother, and lifted a timid hand, placing it lightly on Tommy's shoulder. He didn't move away, but there was little response other than the immediate jump at the sudden touch. Brendan hung his head for a moment. \"Looks like the worst is over,\" he said, taking his hand from Tommy. The younger boy moved the shoulder, as if shooing away the touch. \"Doesn't mean it's finished,\" Tommy replied bleakly, and walked deeper into the house. The pictures sitting on the mantle didn't depict the Conlon house in its true light. It glorified their situation to the point where both brothers felt as if they were looking at photos of a different family. One which actually knew the meaning of the word, and felt that it had meaning. A plate clattered from the kitchen, and Brendan could only imagine his mother's poor shaking hands, not knowing how to function without trembling. He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. As much as he loved his mom, he was nowhere near as close to her as Tommy was. He didn't know what it was about Tommy that made their mother favor him. With Pop, it was easy to see why. But their mom was a whole other story. She'd mentioned once that Tommy reminded her of her late father; she'd never said anything of the sort to Brendan. Tommy walked quickly into the kitchen, leaving Brendan with his mournful thoughts. Alone, as always. \"Mom,\" Tommy greeted in a tender whisper, and the frail woman turned around slowly. The remains of tears still lingered in her eyes, but the boy never brought attention to it. His mother was strong: he wasn't about to take that from her. She quickly set down the dirty plate she was holding, and embraced her son. It was a desperate hug, one full of all the emotions she could never even wish to express. \"Shh,\" he cooed to her, as he felt her body begin to tremble. Tommy had that effect on people: nothing could stay hidden. He triggered such emotion. Brendan leaned like a foreigner in the doorway, and fidgeted with his fingers. They looked so complete, the two of them… mother and son. What did that make Brendan? Forgotten. Or, at least that's what it seemed liked until his mother lifted her head so she could see Brendan from over Tommy's shoulder. Fresh tears now illuminating her hazel eyes, she broke away from Tom, and beckoned for Brendan to come closer. He wasn't going to deny her tender touch, and he hugged her tightly. This time it was the mother to calm her child. Brendan didn't mean to appear so weak, but there was no one there who would judge. He smiled. This is how it should be: him, Tommy, and mom. Sadly, though, Pop was still in the picture. At the thought, Brendan froze. His brother seemed to read his thoughts, and turned to his mother. \"Where's Pop,\" Tommy said dully, as Brendan stepped away from their mother. Helen Conlon looked to her two boys, her head held high. \"Your father,\" she began tightly, the evidence of tears vanishing, \"went out .\" They all knew that meant he was at the bar, drinking far past his fill, and handing away all his money to the alcohol companies. The Budweiser boys were sure to be substantially richer by the time Paddy Conlon was finished. \"What can we do to help you, Ma?\" Brendan asked. The two brothers had learned years ago to stop asking what had happened, rather settling on cleaning up their father's messes. \"I'll get the glass,\" Tommy said bitterly, not waiting for an okay. Grabbing the dustpan from the corner of the kitchen, he walked past Brendan and into the living room. His brother's strength left Brendan in awe. Helen looked at Brendan. \"Everything's okay,\" she assured him, but he knew it was a hollow lie. Even so, he nodded to her. \"Just help your brother with the glass.\" He turned to go out of the room, but glanced back. \"You're sure you're alright?\" \"He didn't hurt me,\" she told him, and that was all she said. Helen looked away from him, and Brendan had no choice but to leave the room. Even if Paddy hadn't hurt her physically, the emotional abuse was still apparent. Why she continued to stay with the man was completely lost to Brendan. \"I hate him,\" Tommy commented once Brendan made his way over to him. The older brother wasn't surprised at the comment, and he nodded. Tom began to forcefully shove the glass into the pan, and looked about ready to rip the carpet right out of the ground. Hands shaking, he let go of the thing harshly. A few pieces of the glass trickled back onto the floor. \"Why can't he just stay away.\" \"Because we keep letting him come back,\" Brendan returned with a shrug. Tommy looked to his brother, eyes appearing almost black. Nothing more was said and he put the few stray pieces of glass into the pan, and left the room. Chapter two! Wooho! Haha, I tried to add a bit more of Brendan in this one, so I hope that turned out okay. Also, I can't remember if they actually said the mother's name in the movie, so I just made up my own. Next chapter, I'm hoping to include Paddy. I'm so nervous about writing him, but I'll do my best. Your comments and ideas are greatly welcomed! Reviews are love!

Please note that the Kit's names and personalities belong to jerod2447 I have permission I on to use them. This takes place five months after the kits are born.) \"Time will mask the past, but will uncover itself for those who seek it.\" Evil-Copper \" A smile was all it took, with a little help from a wise owl. The brightness of day had finally taken over as the unforgiving night before seemed to slip away. A beautiful figure now stood in front of me. My first time seeing a female of my kind. Her coat was as bright as the sun itself. Her eyes, like diamonds, sparkling as the sun shone upon them. Her voice, like a host of angels singing harmoniously into the night.\" \" Her face could light up almost any mood, and thankfully so. Within minutes, we hit it off. If she was to be the one, I need to let her know. 'A natural attraction as it was known. She didn't fully understand my past, but she gave it her all. Once she understood, I realized nothing could stop us as we fell deep in love.\" \"Six? Six what? At the time, I had no idea. Was that the normal quail count? Or was it more, more then what I had ever been taught? I was blind to the course of nature. Then an old friend came to the party... but not for the best reason. He thought I was the one who almost killed his father. But little did he know that I was innocent. Trust me, being chased by a hound dog is not something prey have on their wish list, especially when it was somebody who laid there trust in you. Being hunted by such a fit and experienced dog was bad, but being hunted by him and his master was almost inescapable.\" \"Although the pair of them were less then pleased with me, I could not let my friend be killed by a bear. I turned back to face it, and won, but at what cost. An injured leg? A destroyed relationship? My mate? All I remember was me in the shallows, the hunter standing with his shotgun ready to fire at me, and my friend between us.\" \"Once I recovered, I needed to go back to the place I was born, or at least, where I thought I was.\" \"I had a stroke, and luckily, I was back with the widow. After a sad visit to the vet, it took a while to recover to the point where I could walk again. I knew I had little to no time left to live, and with my mate having a break from the house in the forest, I settled down for the inevitable.\" \"She returned home, with my friends to check up on me, but what I didn't realize was that she had brought me something more valuable than any apology or goodbye. She, with the help of the old owl, Had tracked down my only living relative. the only one I had ever heard of. My mother.\" \"As we spoke, I suddenly became dizzy. When I woke up, my legs were extremely sore. I realized that I was saved from the heavens to have family time.\" \"Moments later, more new was at my door step, I was going to be a father.

I'm really glad to see that so many of you are eager to find out what happens with the second installment of the 'Present' series and how it will go on. First off, I'm really sorry for doing this to you all, but I had absolutely no luck with the original idea. So if you would accept my apologies, I would really be appreciate it.

And once again, a huge shout out to d isneyfangirl for pointing out some errors and the review.) \"Time may heal wounds, but the scars will remain evermore.\" Evil-Copper The sun's orange rays penetrated the night sky, dragging it away for the beginning of another day. The sun may have been out, but the weather was unfavourable for many creatures in the surrounding areas. It had been five whole months since the fox kits had been born into this world. And now that the warm summer nights had faded away, the cold snowy winter months were underway. At the Tweed Farm, all seemed well. The fox couple known as Tod and Vixey were sound asleep in their basket. Since the busy kits arrived, the pair stole every precious minute they could to rest. Although the six kits were a joy to have, their energised bodies and personalities became a handful after some time. Now though, their lazy bodies lay huddled together for warmth. Widow Tweed was awake. Her priorities seemed to wake her while they sun was still young. She had done all her daily cleaning which seemed to suck her energy. Her tired body sunk into her creaky armchair, causing another elderly soul to rise. Rose slowly sat up, her mouth gaping open as she took a deep breath, taking in the ice cold fresh air. As she sat in her basket, her eyes fluttered as they adjusted to the light. She had been helping her son and daughter in-law raise her grandkids. She had been a huge help regarding the kits caretaking. Her experience seemed to guide the kits on the more outdoor life and activities, while her loving nature allowed the old vixen to bond instantly with her grandkids, as well as her new love. Now though, she had more pressing matters on her mind. In light of recent events, as well as those not so recent, her protective side always nudged her to check up on her family, despite knowing they were perfectly safe. She stood up on all fours to take a good look at the group of foxes on the far side of the room. Looking over at the sleeping group, she could not help but feel satisfied with how her circumstances had played out. Her heart could only wish for one thing, and yet somehow she knew her prayer had been answered. 'Oh, Henny. If only you could see your son' \"Good morning, Rose,\" the voice of Widow Tweed caused the vixen to turn around in surprise. It's not as if the old lady's voice was unfamiliar, but Rose was unaware of the widow. Turning her sleepy body to face the old woman, she walked over to see if she could score a back scratch. Once the old vixen was within arms reach, Widow slowly lowered her hand gently onto Rose's back. As she was given a back scratch, she felt a smaller body rub against her foreleg. She looked down to see non other then Sky, looking up and waiting patiently for a hint of being noticed. \"Morning, Grandma,\" His voice showed eagerness to start the day as soon as possible was clearly visible. \"Good morning to you too, Sky. Why are you up so early?\" Rose curiously asked. \"Well, you said you were going to teach us how to fish,\" He responded sharply. \"I'm not going to take you alone. We need to wait for your brothers and sis...\" She was cut short as the young fox ran to the basket where he and his siblings slept. He wasted no time in jumping on his family in order to wake them up, unaware that he would wake the entire house up as he did. Squeals from the fox kits confirmed the rude awakening. Tod and Vixey jumped hearing the cries coming from their kit's basket. They were about to attack, when they noticed that it was only the actions of one fluff ball. \"Sky! What was that for?!\" shouted Fyre as he stood up to chase his brother. \"Sky, why did you have to do that?\" asked Lily as she slowly calmed down. \"We are going to learn how to fish!\" exclaimed Sky as he ran over to Rose. \"Don't be stupid. How are we supposed to fish while the water's all frozen?\" piped up Fyre as he walked over to his father, seeking some sort of warmth. \"Now, now Fyre. Don't be so mean to your brother. He's just exited to find out how to do things himself,\" Vixey calmly said as she stood up to walk over to Widow with Tod along side. The kit's slowly calmed down to a panic as they ran around the house in search of something to do. All the while, knowing that nothing had changed since they had closed their small eyes the night before. Their search was then brought to an immediate hold as Widow recited the words they could not wait to hear, \"Come now, it's time for our visit next door.\" She opened the door, only to be greeted by a wave of invigorating cold air. The trees were lifeless and the ground was white. As white as snow could possibly be. Widow waited for all nine of her foxes to be outside before starting the short yet brutal trek to Amos Slade's Farm. (Author's Note: So, what do you think will happen next? Obviously they will make it there, but after that? Anyhow, thank you to all of my readers, followers and favorites this far, including disneyfangirl447 . Please leave reviews, I love reading what people think about my stories. and also, sorry if my writing has been slaking lately, I've only been able to do about ten minutes at a time, so I lose my rhythm. See you in the next chapter.)[Chapter 3] (Author's note: Hi all. I'm extremely sorry about the long wait but it's finally here. The third chapter to my second installment of the \"Present\" series. Well, we seem to have the one half of the characters, but what about the other?) \"Curiosity killed the cat.\" Author unknown At the Slade Farm, a blanket of snow had been laid upon the land, rendering it almost unrecognizable. The once lush, green trees no longer bared leaves. The grass, now covered in white, was believed to have retreated back into the comfort of the slightly warmer ground. The homely brown barrels lay vacant as the cold air drove the inhibitors into their master's warm wooden house. Inside the winter shelter were two dogs, lying sprawled out in front of the fire for warmth. The master, Amos Slade, was perched on the couch a small distance away. In his hand sat a large cup of coffee, from which he took occasional sips as he watched over his two best friends on the floor. As Amos fixed his gaze on the pair of retired hunting dogs, he couldn't help but feel satisfied with how the events had played out. If it was not for the childhood friendship that should have not come to be, the two farms would not have united in peace. Their inhabiters would never have found a truce wherein they found friends. The fresh snow falling on the tin roof collected and fell to the ground, causing a thud loud enough to awaken any form of life. Chief was the first one up. His curiosity had increased, as well as the undeniable infatuation he had found in his old enemies long lost mother. The mere thought of her gentle face was enough to bring his old heart to skip a beat. And if this was not enough, the way in which her body swayed and the soft voice only angels could use was more then enough to bring him to his knees. His past may not have been the brightest, but his future certainly was. Copper was up soon after. His mind seemed to think of his adopted father as frail, not that he was. Chief's mind may have had it's fair share of days off, but that was of no consequence. The Bloodhound had found himself growing more fond and understanding to the way in which life worked. Thanks to Rose and Big Mama, he had found something completely unknown. The way in which life should cycle. Unfortunately, that didn't prepare him for everything life could through at him, especially when it came to more subtle yet life changing events. Before any trace amount of noise was made, the creaking of a door grabbed the trio's attention. The frosty breeze and light flurry of snow was an indication of what was next to come. \"Uncle Copper!\" the sound of six fox kits dulled any other noises as they screamed, racing to the Bloodhound they found laying with his eyes firm on the scurrying orange fluff. Their young bodies flew into the air, sending them crashing into the tan brown hound's warm body. As the kits greeted Copper in the usual fashion, the three adult foxes entered. The orange of their fur now slightly whiter, having forged a path for the kits to follow in. Tod and Vixey shied away from Rose and headed straight to the fire to catch the warmth emitting from it's yellow flames. \"Copper, how yea been?\" Tod asked the bloodhound as he retreated to his spot having finally escaped the mountain of fox kits. \"Oh same as yesterday, cold and tired. And what about you guys?\" Tod smiled as he looked over to his mate, hoping that Vixey would be the one to answer. \"We've been better...\" She said. \"Whata' do' yea mean?\" Chief said as he found his position as close to the fireplace as his hair would allow. \"It's been quite busy without you folks to help us out,\" Rose said as she slowly lay down next to her new love, \"Keeping the kit's calm has been a mission.\" \"Well, it's been harder not bein' round my love to help,\" Chief said as he leaned over and gave Rose a long lick to her muzzle. \"Please, not now...\" It was not the fact that they were once enemies that brought Copper to stop them, but the fact that the kit's may see and ask questions they are not ready for was plenty. Rose soon shifted her muzzle away from her loves, blushing as if she has her first kiss. \"Oh, com' on Rose. That couldn'ta been your first kiss, now,\" Chief said in an effert to try and bring the already red vixen to blush even more. The sight of his new love blushing as if she were having her first crush ask her out seemed to place the old Wolfhound under a trance. \"Hm... Tod. Should we ask them about...\" Vixey whispered to her mate, trying to prevent them from hearing, but it was just to loud and Copper's sensitive ears seemed to pick up the question, spiking his curiosity. \"Ask us what?\" (Author's note: I'm sorry to leave you all with a cliff hanger, but this is where I need to check where I stand. Please leave a review and Fav/follow if possible. I have other things I need to attend to for a while but I'll see you all soon.)[Chapter 4] Author's Note: Hi all. I am in a bit of a situation. I have too many responsibilities I have to uphold, and by the look of things, I'll need to drop one of my stories for the time being.

I'm really sorry for the time I have spend not updating any of my stories, but I'm afraid I may have to take a long break.

Probably could handle himself well. Dropping from the steps Tommy walked around the bag. \"Hey Kid,\" Tommy spoke behind him. The kid refused to turn but responded, \"Look I'm almost done,\" The kid lashed out, \"I got a session with Dennis in 10 min, then she's all yours.\" Tommy smirked and looked away before shaking his head, \"Dennis huh? That's a nice jab you got there, who taught you how to box?\" The kid stopped and rolled his eyes, \"Dude I'm trying to train, can you just back the fuck off.\" 'Little shit' Tommy smirked, he moved around to face the kid who hadn't looked at him yet. \"Simple question.\" Tommy pondered. Backing off the kid raised his hands in frustration, \"Dude just leave me the- Oh shit.\" Tommy raised an eyebrow, kid finally recognized him. \"You're Tommy Conlon.\" He stuttered. Tommy nodded. \"Last time I checked,\" He handed the boy a water bottle, \"You watch MMA?\" The kid took it gratefully and downed it nodding, \"Fuck yeah. That shit is intense.\" Tommy looked around and crossed his arms, \"Ever been in a cage?\" The kid shook his head, \"I stick to the ring, and cage really isn't for me. Did some amateur stuff but it never went anywhere.\" Tommy shrugged, \"Too bad. Little coaching, add some steps, that right hook of yours could be doing some serious damage.\" Tommy began to walk away but the kids voice followed. \"You think so?\" The kid asked hopefully, \"You think I could fight cage one day.\" Tommy looked the scrawny kid up and down and smirked, \"Wouldn't be wasting my time here did I didn't think so. Anyway. See ya.\" -break- Tommy took a break from his training and watched the mystery kid walk around the gym before he settled in the corner and set his bag down. Tommy walked into Colts office and knocked. \"We running a daycare? Kid seems comfortable\" Hs asked Colt, nodding to boy on the floor below. Colt laughed not looking up from his desk. \"That's Mark.\" Not even needing to look at whom Tommy was talking about. \"Family?\" Tommy questioned. Colt shook his head, \"Nope. Family friend. Sister works as a nightshift nurse down at County. She needed some help out; he was getting into some trouble. So, I offered to let him come here, kids a natural boxer.\" Tommy grunted, \"No shit. I watched his lesson. You teach him?\" Colt snorted, \"Shit no. That's natural. He's Bruisy Phillips kid.\" Tommy shocked for a second looked at the kid below doing some homework, \"Damn. Bruisy Phillips?\" Colt looked up and nodded, \"The one and only. Trained by the pops himself.\" Crossing his arms Tommy just shook his head. Shit, his dad was a legend in the 'Burgh.' The kid had some real talent. Tommy wanted to see what he could use it for. -break- Elizabeth pulled into the parking lot at Colts and hurried out. It was around 830, her shift had ended a bit early, and so she was grateful that she wasn't picking up Mark too late. Slamming the door shut she ran into lobby. No one was at the desk and Elizabeth groaned; she just wanted to grab Mark and go. She walked past the empty desk and looked for her brother, she just saw guys working out. \"Can I help you?\" Someone spoke behind her. Elizabeth turned and stared at the man who approached her, he was attractive, but he was just like the rest of them. \"Colt around?\" She asked annoyed, not wanting to talk to some meathead. The guy smirked and shook his head, \"He's out. I work for him, I'm Tommy.\" He held out his hand. Elizabeth hesitated before shaking it. \"Elizabeth,\" She commented before letting go, \"I'm looking for my brother,\" She brought up her hands, \"He is about this tall, teenager, probably running his mouth.\" Tommy couldn't help but laugh, \"Mark's in the office,\" He pressed down on the intercom and spoke into it, \"Kid get your ass up here, your sisters here.\" Elizabeth heard a door slam and could see from the back as her brother made his way down the steps and jogging over to her. \"Hey you.\" She acknowledges, Mark gave her a nod. Tommy wanted to laugh, the kid was young but he towered over his older sister. \"Hi Liz.\" He stood there awkwardly before Elizabeth smiled and motioned to the door leading outside \"You all set?\" She asked, Mark nodded and shifted his bag on his shoulder. \"Yeah lets go.\" She flashed a smile to Tommy, \"Thanks again.\" Tommy nodded, \"No problem.\" He shifted his gaze to the brother, \"Later kid.\" Mark gave him a tired smile, \"Bye Tommy. See you tomorrow.\" Tommy would have recognized her anywhere. Elizabeth Phillips was just as known as her father. The ringside beauty of the arena they called her. She was only a teenager then, but the name stuck. She was still beautiful. Elizabeth, her mother and brother all went to every match Bruisy had. When Bruisy won the World Title, it was Elizabeth, just 18 in the photo at the center, hugging her father. Proud and strong. It was rotten luck just a week later he would be killed along with his wife in a drunk driving incident. He watched the siblings through the glass. Elizabeth wrapped her arm around her brother and stood up to ruffled his hair a bit. He playfully shoved her away and she laughed before kicking him. Tommy couldn't help but wonder what that was like, a happy family. Maybe he would know someday. -break- Elizabeth placed the pasta on the table and watched as Mark took a scoop for himself. He passed it to her and she smiled and got herself a serving. \"So how was Colts?\" She asked taking a small bite. Noticing Mark wasn't too interested in dinner. Mark shrugged, \"It was alright\" Elizabeth laughed, \"Alright? What did you do? Didn't you have a lesson with Dennis today?\" Mark rolled his eyes, \"I TRAINED, we had a SESSION. I don't need lessons, I am not some amateur.\" Elizabeth laughed, \"Touchy. Ok, how was the session. What did he say? Think you can compete?\" Mark nodded, \"He told me within a couple of months I will be good enough for a real tournament.\" Elizabeth nodded, \"Good. But you know the rules, any Ds or Fs and you can't compete.\" Mark nodded, \"I know Liz.\" He played with his food for a second before taking a breath and looked at his sister. \"That guy you met tonight, Tommy-\" He began, \"Tommy's an MMA fighter. One of the best.\" Elizabeth took a sip of her water and shrugged, \"I care? Colt runs an MMA/Boxing gym. Probably has a lot of those guys around.\" Mark looked at his sister before speaking up, \"He says I may have what it takes to get in the cage.\" Elizabeth stopped chewing and brought her napkin to her face and closed her eyes before setting it down, \"Mark-\" Mark spoke up, \"Liz hear me out-\" Elizabeth shook her head in frustration, \"The judge said NO fighting. You are already hanging on by a leash. If anything were to happen-\" Mark stood up and banged his fist on the table, startling Elizabeth, \"This isn't like that!\" He shouted, \"I'm not getting into some fights on the streets or hanging out with Rowley and his crew ok! Tommy is a professional fighter! He fights in SPARTA and Professional matches. Those aren't back alley beat downs! Besides,\" He pleaded to her, \"I would be at the gym, not getting into trouble.\" \"Mark\" Elizabeth whispered, \"You have no reason to raise your voice at me, I just said-\" \"I know what you said,\" He countered, \"You are saying no. This isn't fair, you aren't my mother, and you shouldn't be able to make these decisions. I'm almost an adult-\" \"You are 16 years old Mark.\" Elizabeth hissed, \"And I am doing my best along with Gran to keep this family together.\" She tossed her napkin on the table, losing her appetite; \"You have NO right to talk about making decisions, when the last few you made got you in jail. Who had to bail you out huh Mark? Tell me.\" He stood there silent. Elizabeth nodded, \"Right. Me. So if you have any plans on getting a job soon, or paying rent, or paying the bills then by all means make your own decisions. But as long as you live in my house, you will respect me and follow my rules. Do you understand?\" Mark nodded; Elizabeth took the plates from the table and walked into the kitchen. Mark followed behind her guilty. \"Liz…\" he spoke up, \"Liz I'm sorry.\" Elizabeth shook her head, \"Don't be sorry, just…Mark try for me ok? I'm trying and I can't do this alone.\" He nodded, \"I know.\" Setting the dishes in the sink she turned to face him, \"If you want to train for MMA. Then I need to know more ok, Colt offered to help you box, he has to be on board for this. Then we can talk?\" Mark smiled and ran over to his sister and lifting her off the ground in a giant hug. \"Thanks sis.\" He whispered and set her down before walking away. Elizabeth smiled and watched him retreat. Glancing over to the fridge she the picture of her once completed family. She sighed, wishing for the better days and went back to cleaning.

I hope you can all find the time to review.I love hearing feedback, ideas, questions, comments, or just a friendly this was amazing or why rip my heart out like that! haha. Flailing is encouraged. Mending The Heart Chapter 2 \"We're never so vulnerable than when we trust someone - but paradoxically, if we cannot trust, neither can we find love or joy.\"- Frank Kane Elizabeth sat in Colts office and pinched the bridge of her nose in frustration. Not actually believing that he would be agreeing to this. \"So you're saying I should let him train? Forgo the boxing and let him do this MMA.\" Colt stood up from his desk, \"I'm saying you should least give it a chance. Liz. The kid can always go back to boxing. If he has an interest in MMA, let's see where it goes. What's the worse that could happen?\" Elizabeth snapped her head forward and gave him a death glare. \"Have you forgotten I work for a county hospital? I can give you detailed accounts of the many MMA fighters I have encountered over the last few years.\" \"Liz he's a kid. He's a good kid.\" Colt pressured, \"He is a little lost right now. What's wrong with him exploring different outlooks?\" He sat in front of her on his desk, \"You want him to end up back with Rowley?\" Elizabeth stood up and shook her head, \"God. Don't even say that. It's just. Colt,\" She sighed, \"That's my baby brother.\" Colt nodded, \"I understand that.\" \"Good,\" She nodded, \"And what about this Tommy character? You sure you can't train him.\" Colt rolled his eyes, \"I have my hands full already, don't worry Tommy's good. I trust him.\" Elizabeth bit her lip, \"He isn't just some meathead that is going to beat the shit out of Mark right? He knows his stuff?\" She questioned nervously. Colt bit back a laugh and just nodded \"Tommy's one of my best fighters. I wouldn't have anyone else train him. You know that.\" Elizabeth nodded, \"Of course, and I trust you. Completely. Just…Can I talk to Tommy? Is he here?\" Colt nodded and stood up from his desk and walked out the door yelling for the guy. Couple seconds later, he was standing with the two in Colts office. \"So you told Mark he could be an MMA fighter?\" Elizabeth busted out, getting straight to the point. Tommy just laughed and raised his hands in defense. \"I just told him with a little work he could probably fight.\" Elizabeth clicked her tongue in annoyance and just shook her head in frustration, \"Because that's not what he was dying to hear, a top MMA fighter telling him that he has potential. Just bury that down in the dream boat, not actually consider it.\" \"Look, the kids got talent.\" Elizabeth sighed, \"I know. It's just. Mark has responsibilities. He has…issues that keep him grounded. School is priority over fighting. Is that understood?\" \"Crystal.\" Tommy nodded. \"Good. And if he is over this, over fighting, over cage and wants to go back to box. Then he is free to do so. He's a kid. You can see when limits are at the breaking point. I am trusting you to know when enough is enough.\" \"I will.\" Tommy promised. Elizabeth let out a sigh of relief, \"Good because if I hear any word you step out of line, I will come down here and I will kick your ass.\" Tommy couldn't help but laugh and slap Colt on the back, \"She's got some balls Boyd, she most definitely is her fathers daughter.\" Tommy smirked. Elizabeth just shrugged, \"I protect what's mine. I trust you Tommy. I want your word.\" Tommy looked her up and down, her demeanor showed she was serious, \"Sure I'll train baby Philips.\" He answered, \"Can't promise anything but that I can make him a fighter, and I will make sure it's done right.\" Elizabeth accepted his words and reached into her purse. She got out her checkbook, but Tommy stepped forward and shook his head. \"Don't-\" Tommy began, Colt raising his eyebrow next to him, \"I don't need payment Elizabeth. Seeing as I am the single-hand possibly of destroying the Phillips boxing legacy by this, might as well do it for free.\" It was the first time she smiled in the entire meeting, \"Great. Makes me feel tons better.\" She replied with a hint of sarcasm that had him smiling as well. \"So.\" She clapped, \"Let's discuss schedules.\" 40 minutes later she noticed the clock on the wall, \"Crap! I'm late. Well,\" Grabbing her belongings, \"Thanks for the reassurance Boyd and thanks for the promise to not kill my brother Mr. Conlon.\" She stuck her hand out and Tommy shook it giving her a nod. She excused herself from the room and began to descend the stairs. Mark was waiting for her at the bottom. \"Well!?\" He pressed as they walked through the gym. \"Well what?\" She teased. Mark groaned, \"Liz! What's the verdict?\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes. \"I'm late for work and we gotta go. So if you want the details about when Mr. Conlon is going to start training, then I suggest you follow me and get your ass in the car.\" Mark threw a fist bump and cursed with excitement. Elizabeth turned at his choice of words and he stopped as nodded. But not before turning and giving the guys up top thumbs up. They watched amused from above, \"Hmm pro bono?\" Colt spoke up, \"That's not like you Tommy. Figured you would want the extra cash.\" Tommy shrugged, \"I know what it's like to struggle, and she's your friend. Besides the kids a pistol, figured make it easier on her that way.\" \"Sure. Easier.\" Colt slapped Tommy on the back and walked away. \"Get back to work Conlon I'm not paying you to stand around a look pretty.\" -break- \"You gotta be quick Mark,\" Tommy warned, \"The other guy isn't going to wait around for you to make a decision.\" He shoved the young boy back rough, \"He's gonna come at you fast and he's gonna hit hard. Tommy smacked him with his glove and Mark ducked before kicking the padding Tommy held at his stomach. After 3 weeks of training, Tommy had found out Mark was a fucking monster. The kid had this raw natural talent and put that to work fast. The only problem, Mark had a problem with authority. So training was always push and pull. \"Hey!\" Tommy yelled hitting the kid again. \"Focus or someone is going to knock your lights out.\" Mark just growled and threw a couple punches that Tommy easily blocked and countered. And hour later Mark was on the bench exhausted. Tommy watched him from the ring and didn't feel sorry for him, kid worked hard and he earned the pain. Meant he was doing it right. Tommy unwrapped the tape and crawled out of the ring. He stood in front of Mark and acknowledged him. \"Nice work on the counters, still a bit early on the release though. We also gotta work on putting for force into your kicks but you'll get it.\" Mark rested against the wall and nodded. \"Jesus. I thought boxing was difficult. It's been what 3 weeks. Shit Tommy. I feel like I wanna die. Tommy smirked \"That's called success kid.\" Mark laughed and just shook his head, \"Man all I want is my bed and a giant piece of pizza. But I know all I'll get tonight is a 2 page essay and some protein shake you keep making me eat with a salad.\" Tommy shrugged, \"Diets Important, you knew that going in. And can't really talk bout education. Dropped out at 16 to take care of my ma before joining the corps.\" \"Wish I could do that.\" Mark admitted, \"Drop out. Fight for a living. Elizabeth would hear nothing of that though. Doesn't matter, I'm her ward till 18, and if I don't get straight I am back in Juivie.\" Tommy nodded and sat down, \"Colt mentioned you had some trouble-\" Mark shrugged, \"Just fell into the wrong crowd. Stupid stuff. Ya know?\" \"All been there.\" Tommy agreed, he stood up and kicked the kid in good fun, \"Now rest up and eat something. We got 45 min left before your sister gets here.\" Mark groaned, \"Why do I feel like the next 45 min are going to suck.\" Tommy tossed him a towel, \"You can quit anytime remember-\" \"Shut up,\" Mark snapped. Tommy just shrugged, \"Hey, not my time.\" Mark just watched Tommy walk away and took out a power bar and inhaled it. Getting ready for whatever Tommy had next. -break- Elizabeth had arrived early to the gym. Instead of waiting in Colts office she just sat around on some random bench in the gym reading a magazine as she waited for Mark to finish changing. Willing to admit though she did look a tad bit funny in scrubs just waiting, but she didn't care. \"Hey doc,\" one of the guys called from the ring, \"Care to check me over?\" he winked. Elizabeth just ignored him; she didn't need to waste her energy. The guy continued and stepped closer to the ropes around the ring, \"You deaf doc, I'm talking to you.\" Elizabeth turned the page, \"I wish,\" she muttered. Normally one or two guys would try to talk to her whenever she came around. Most knew better, she could handle herself but some of the meatheads; they were quite intimidating so she normally kept to herself. When the guy crawled through the ropes and walked over to her, she stilled and waited to see what he would do. \"I'm talking to you,\" The guy spit out, \"It's polite to respond.\" Elizabeth sighed and looked up from her chair, \"Look. If my silence wasn't an answer, then let me be clear. No. I would not like to talk to you, frankly I don't even want to look at you.\" His buddies laughed and he stepped forward, \"You little-\" Suddenly Tommy was there, walking between them. \"Problem here?\" Tommy asked looking over to Elizabeth. The guy stepped back and put his hands up in defense. \"Just talking Tommy. Just talking.\" He walked away and Tommy walked over to Elizabeth, \"You ok,\" He asked with a tenderness she had trouble believing came from this man. \"Course,\" She laughed it off, \"It was nothing I couldn't handle. If I had a problem with meatheads I wouldn't let my brother in here.\" She shifted awkwardly. \"So…where is the kid anyway?\" Tommy smirked and pointed behind him, \"You know Mark.\" Elizabeth rolled her eyes, \"I swear. The kid spends more time worrying about his looks than I do. Jesus. We are bout to be in a car for the next 30 min, who the hell is he going to impress.\" Tommy shrugged, \"Never know.\" He stepped over to the desk and began to shuffle some papers around and she got a good look at him. He was fresh from a sparring session, most likely with Mark. Tommy had a towel over his shoulder, but it didn't hide the sweat that masked his forehead. She took the moment to look at the ink he had on his body, she was curious about what they meant. She would never ask out of embarrassment though, she didn't need any attention to why she wanted to know. \"Hey sis,\" Mark spoke up walking over to them, breaking her stare. She smiled and laughed when she saw her brother. Freshly showered and combed hair, she was grateful he felt the need to wash after training but there was no need to prim and pamper. \"Jesus, what were you doing in there?\" She teased, \"Is your hair that important.\" Mark shrugged, \"The ladies love it.\" He dropped his locker keys on the table. \"See you later Tommy.\" \"Night.\" Tommy said looking up from the desk and waved, \"Safe driving Liz.\" Elizabeth saluted Tommy, \"Always,\" She took Marks bag from him, seeing the exhaustion on his face, \"Come on kiddo, let's go home.\" Mark had no objections. Elizabeth she buckled her seatbelt and Mark got settled next to her. \"You know next time Liz, he might catch you staring.\" Elizabeth ignored him and turned her key in the ignition, \"I have no idea what you are talking about.\" Mark just laughed, \"Sure. Don't worry sis, secret is safe with me. And if it makes you feel any better, I always catch him staring at you.\" Elizabeth blushed and refused to speak not daring to touch that subject the entire ride back to the house.

Love you all! xoxo. Enjoy! Chapter 3 \"Count the garden by the flowers, never by the leaves that fall. Count your life with smiles and not the tears that roll.\"- Anonymous Elizabeth yawned and walked into her kitchen. Turning on the coffee pot, she loathed the clock stating back with the numbers 5:45 am. Normally on her day off she wouldn't be up this early on the weekend, but her grandmother had an appointment and Elizabeth offered to take her. It was getting colder now in Burgh as they headed into winter, so she was kind of regretting these early morning appointments now. Hearing the beep, the machine was done. Elizabeth walked over and picked up the pot, pouring herself a nice hot cup. Indulging in the lift she needed, she was unaware of the new presence entering the room. The latch of the kitchen door suddenly shot open and Mark, of all people walked inside the house. She stated at him for a second confused, looking around the room before setting her cup down. \"That's so funny.\" She began \"I could've swore that you didn't know the world existed before 10 on the weekends.\" Elizabeth teased. Mark laughed and tugged his hoodie back; during their training over the last coiple weeks, Tommy has been giving me some cardio tips about running. \"Tommy kind of forced it out of me, though I am glad. Haven't felt this great in weeks.\" Mark acknowledged. Elizabeth just raised her eyebrow and walked over to the cabinet and pulled out a box of cereal. She lifted it to him and he shook his head. \"No thanks, I think I'm going take a shower and then rest a bit. It's fucking cold outside.\" He shivered. Elizabeth could only laugh, \"Welcome to Pittsburgh.\" He began to move towards the stairs, \"HEY!\" She called, he stopped and turned, \"I'm going to go to grams for a bit. She has a doctor's appointment and I offered to drive.\" Mark nodded, \"Well, I have no school work for the weekend cause of the holiday so I was gonna take the bus and head to the movies. Meet up with a couple of friends from school. Probably check out the new action flick.\" Elizabeth was hesitant to believe him. \"When you say friends-\" \"School friends\" Mark assured, he paused and sighed, \"Liz you gotta believe I don't talk to Rowley anymore. Not since I was arrested.\" She accepted that, \"Good. So do you need any money then?\" She pointed to her purse, \"There's a 20 in my bag if you -\" Mark shook his head and raised up his hand. \"Na, been helping out around the gym after I finish my homework. Colt gave me a couple bucks. Said besides training I could do some part time stuff.\" Elizabeth was surprised and grateful, \"That's nice of him.\" She poured her cereal into a nearby bowl, \"Keep in touch ok? Text me when you leave and when you get of the movies.\" Mark laughed, \"Yeah, yeah. I know MOM.\" He joked. \"I'll check in for ya you worry wart.\" Elizabeth smiled \"Somebody's got too. Now go rest.\" Mark saluted her and mumbled a 'give grams my love' as he climbed up the stairs to his bedroom. -break- Elizabeth and Marge, her grandmother, arrived at Liz's house around noon. Marge was restless and Liz loved her company, so offering lunch was nothing but genuine. They were in the middle of a conversation about maybe getting a pet when a car door slammed out front. Elizabeth not expecting company got up from the table and looked out the window. Narrowing her eyes when she saw Carter 'Rowley' Collins waking up to her porch. She turned to her grandmother. \"Grams,\" She said without hesitation, \"Grab the phone. I may need you to call the police.\" She whispered, not daring to look away from the window yet. \"Why?\" Her grandmother stood up concerned, \"What's wrong? Who is it?\" Elizabeth snapped her head towards her grandmother and gave her a hard stare, \"An old problem I thought was dealt with. Now please.\" She took the cordless phone and slid it across the table. \"If he approaches, call 911. We have a restraining order.\" Opening the front door she hesitated to grab the bat that was next to it. She walked outside and Rowley stopped, admiring the young woman. \"Well, it's been a long time, hasn't it Liz.\" \"Spare me the pleasantries Rowley. You can leave my property now.\" She pointed to his car with her bat. The man in front of her just continued to smile, \"Now is that anyway to treat an old friend.\" \"I'm not your friend nor one of your goons.\" Elizabeth spit out, \"Mark is done with you. I'm done with you. Leave us the hell alone.\" He took a step forward; Elizabeth took one as well, her grip tightening. She was not going to let him intimidate her. \"Afraid I can't do that Sweetheart. See before the misunderstanding-\" \"You mean his arrest,\" she sneered, raising the bat. \"I should beat the living shit out of you for what you put me and my family through.\" Rowley laughed, \"Mark could make his own decisions.\" \"Mark is a child. A CHILD Carter.\" She reasoned, \"You disrespected him, and most importantly;y me.\" Carter straightened his tie and shrugged, \"Does not matter. What does is that Marks last fight cost me a pretty penny. I need to collect what I am owed.\" Elizabeth crossed her arms and stood in front of this man not amused, \"No. Mark told me he never took any money.\" \"No.\" Rowley continued, \" He never took any money's but those fights he did were shall we say off the books. And that last one. Mark told me to do double or nothing, and he lost. So I am here to collect.\" Elizabeth looked at him disgusted, \"Maybe you shouldn't gamble on children. For god sake-\" Rowley stepped forward quick and grabbed the bat, Elizabeth refused to budge. He brought her close, \"Oh your brother had all the right means. It was a tragic loss, losing him. But now I need the payment. Soon.\" \"How much?\" Elizabeth she hissed. Rowley looked away before answering, \"Ten thousand.\" Elizabeth closed her eyes for a second, shaking her head in disbelief. Rowley let go of the bat and took a step back. \"Unless, give me one night Elizabeth. One night with you and all his troubles go away.\" Elizabeth spit at his feet instantly. \"You are a piece of filth Collins, it would be a cold day in hell before I came near you and your-\" Rowley sneered and backhanded her hard across the face. She fell to the ground, \"Learn some respect.\" He hissed in a low whisper. Holding her cheek, Elizabeth turned to look at this man with a deadly expression. Letting go of the bat she stood up and wiped a small trickle of blood on the side of her lip. Without any fear or doubt she pulled her first back, and punched him square in the face. He stumbled away in shock. \"You forget Mr. Collins, I grew up around pieces of shit like yourself and I will not be bought. My father was a talented man and he taught me how to defend myself, scum like you do not scare me. Now if you can do me a favor, please get the FUCK off my property.\" She asked politely. Wiping blood from his nose, he shook his head in disappointment, \"That was a mistake Ms. Phillips.\" Elizabeth shook her head, \"The mistake was standing by why you tried to ruin my brothers life.\" She could hear the sirens in the distance. She smirked. \"Looks like someone called the cops\" He lunged and she reached for the bat and stood ready. \"Try it! I'd love to take this bat to your pretty little face.\" Conflicted he stood there, becoming angrier by the second, \"I should have you arrested for assault!\" She straightened herself up and looked the man up and down before scoffing, \"Besides. You may be powerful. But even you can't slide from a court ordered restraining order. I suggest you leave before I press charges for violating it. And for assault.\" Rowley spit on her lawn and nodded, \"Ten thousand dollars Ms. Phillips. I intend to collect.\" \"You'll get your money, every fucking cent and then you will leave us alone.\" She challenged. The man hurried back to his vehicle before driving away. When the police arrived she explained the situation. A drunk man had approached her and she was grateful the police arrived. Stepping inside the house, she drew her cell phone from her coat pocket. Dialing Mark's number without a second glance. When Mark stepped inside his house 2 hours later he knew something was wrong. Elizabeth stood leaning against the kitchen sink while his grandmother looked on from the island table. \"What's going on?\" He asked curiously. \"Rowley came to visit today Mark,\" Elizabeth stated, getting straight to the point. \"Want to let in on the reason why?\" Mark shook his head confused, \"Elizabeth! No- I have no idea-\" \"Damn it mark!\" Elizabeth screamed, \"Don't lie to me! I am sick of it.\" \"I'm not!\" He pleaded, \"I told you I'm done with Rowley! Elizabeth you gotta believe me.\" She laughed, \"No. I'm tired.\" She whispered, \" All I have done is try. I've tried to think positive but Mark. God mark how could you be do stupid! Fighting for money.\" He looked away suspicious, \"I don't know what-\" \"STOP.\" She screamed pushing herself from the sink and walking towards him with a menacing gaze, \"I know all about it. The gambling the bets, for god sakes he came to our house Mark.\" He stared at his sister, \"I never bet. Never took any of that money, Elizabeth you have to believe me. Please,\" he begged. \"Ten thousand dollars Mark-\" \"It was dumb! He told me it was a simple fight and that it was double or nothing! The guy had the upper hand from the start and I lost. That's why I beat the other guy to escape! I had to get out of there because Rowley blamed me.\" She just shook her head, \"And now he is looking for the money.\" \"YBut Elizabeth I swear I never took money.\" \"You fought for it though.\" She whispered, \"Under the table with crooks. Dangerous people. \" She took a step back and laughed, \"God haven't I taught you anything.\" Mark became enraged, \"You know what. Fuck you Elizabeth! I can't do this anymore\" He screamed, starling her and their grandmother, \"All you ever want to see if the bad in me! You never focus on me changing! I never lied! You never give me the change even get a fucking word-\" \"That's enough!\" Marge scolded, \"We are family, you don't talk to each other like this.\" \"Then tell her.\" Mark pointed to his sister, \"She won't listen to me. She never has.\" He walked away from the kitchen, going to grab his coat. Elizabeth followed him. \"Don't you dare walk out that door.\" She scolded, as she went to grab his arm and he twisted away and grabbed her in return to hold her, then went to punch on reflex. Luckily he stopped before he could hit her. Mark instantly let go and backed away. She saw the look of fear in his eyes before he bolted. Elizabeth could just stare. Rubbing the bruise forming on her arm. -break- As soon as Mark had left Elizabeth called Colt. Letting him know to keep an eye out for her younger brother. Colt calmed her down and told her not to worry, the kid would show up sooner or later. And not 3 hours later Colt saw the young man make his way into the small diner across the street. Tommy had been over dropping off some equipment when Colt told him what went down. Tommy told Colt not to worry and he would handle it. Walking inside, Tommy didn't wait to announce himself before sliding in front of Mark at the booth. Mark sat there shuffling around some mashed potatoes on his plate. A lukewarm soda to his right showing no signs of being finished. \"You alright kid?\" Tommy questioned. Mark shrugged \"Dunno. I suppose you're here to take me home.\" Tommy shook his head and motioned for the waitress's. \"Can I get a coffee.\" She nodded and left. He studied the kid for a hot second and could tell he as having some serious problems staying composed. His coffee was delivered and he welcomed the bitter shake of the cold leaving. \"You wanna tell me why Colt got a call from your sis saying you ran?\" He pushed. Marks gaze shifted, \"That's none of your fucking business. I don't have to tell you shit.\" Tommy set his cup down and lowered his gaze. \"Curse at me again and I'll pop you one. I didn't come here for a fight but don't think for one second that smart mouth is going to save you from anything. Now tell me, what the hell happened.\" He warned. \"Rowley.\" Mark sighed, \"The guy I was fighting for, he came to visit Elizabeth today at our house.\" \"Rowley Collins? Carter Collins, that Rowley?\" He questioned, Mark nodded, and Tommy let out a breath, \"Shit Mark.\" Mark understood, \"I know. I lost a big fight before I got out and he lost a lot of money that he wants back.\" \"How much is a lot.\" Tommy pondered. Mark hesitated before speaking, \"Ten thousand.\" \"Jesus Christ kid.\" Tommy Cursed under his breath. Mark sighed. \"When I got home today Elizabeth was just there and went off. Screaming at me, saying how I lied and that how hurt she was I had been fighting for money. I tried to tell her I never took a cent but she just wouldn't stop! Then she told me he came by tried to proposition her and grams said she hit him but fuck Tommy I was so mad. She tried to hid it but I saw her cheek. He hit her. So I wanted to find him. Make sure he would never touch her again. But-\" Tommy could tell he wasn't finished then what. \"She grabbed me, and without a second thought I almost hit her. My own sister. I would never! I was just so mad. I think she knows that but I didn't stay. I left and I got on the bus to go to Rowley, but ended up here.\" Tommy was quiet for a long time before speaking, absorbing it all. \"Don't worry about the money and don't worry about Rowley.\" He assured the young boy, \"I'll handle that. But you need to go home. Elizabeth is probably going out of her mind and the last thing she would have wanted is you coming home with your face kicked in. You hear me. You stay away from Carter Collins and his crew.\" Mark nodded. \"Another thing.\" Tommy stood up, \"You lay a hand to your sister again and we are going to have words. That fucking clear?\" Mark nodded \"Crystal.\" Tommy pulled out his wallet and tossed some bills on the table. \"Get your suit I'm taking you home.\" Mark stared at the man confused, \"You don't down a car.\" Tommy shrugged, \"Got one now. Don't make a deal out of it.\" Authors Note: I hope you all liked it. I know there was no Elizabeth/Tommy but I needed to get some of the family issues going down.

What about these other two.\" \"Mr. White is older, around Joe's age. They seemed like buddies that went way back. I got him talking after awhile, I think we can find something about him in Wisconsin, he was rooting for the Brewers, no one roots for the Brewers.\" \"We can start running him tomorrow. I have a buddy up in the Milwaukie I can call. What about this Miss Silver, does she seem like the girl we've seen hanging around the Cabots.\" \"From the reports I've read it would seem that she's the same person. Not too tall, long blonde hair, she looked very familiar, plus she holds her way with Joe and Eddie. Hell it seemed like All four of them were friends and I was the outsider.\" \"Freddy, you are the outsider. If this is the same girl we've seen around, we have some good news. She's in and out of the Cabot's property the most. We can get a tail on her tomorrow, see if we can get anything to help you. Anything else I should know?\" \"They bought the story-\" \"Of course they bought the story Freddy, you murdered that story and made it your own.

Eddie says we have to pick up Miss Silver. Fine, no big deal. Except, except the fact we picked her up from high school. Catholic school. Holdaway, Cabot's working a kid, a fucking kid. His own daughter at that!\" \"Which school?\" \"I couldn't fucking tell, all catholic school's look the same.\" \"Obviously this changes things. Our first priority is still to bring Cabot down, but the second priority is we need her out of their. She's a minor and she could get caught up in the crossfire. Do you know what her part is in this heist?\" \"No fucking clue, after Joe told her code name he didn't mention her again the whole powwow, hell she sat there reading a book.\" \"She might not be involved then, but we need more information about her. You need to keep her safe.\" \"I agree.\" \"What about the others then?\" \"It looks like me and two other guys aren't in the in crowd, but one of them had done some jobs before.\" \"What are their names?\" \"Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown. There's also a Mr. Blonde and a Mr. Blue.\" \"You went to dinner with them, got to know them yeah, any obvious weak points.\" \"That girl, Miss Silver, most of them have their entire lives centered around her. Looks like the majority of them would do anything for her.\" \"Which ones? And why?\" \"From what I can tell, White treats her like a daughter, same with Blue. She's a lot closer with Blonde and Eddie though, but it's all platonic there. There was also a lot of talk of a Mr. Purple, seems like he's pretty central. She spends a lot of time with him. She has most of these guys wrapped around her finger.\" \"Sounds like she's the chink in the armour. Try to get something out of her. Anything else happening between now and the heist?\" \"Everyone is buddying up tomorrow to run over the plans, I'm with white. Then we all go to a hotel for the night, suit up the next day and hit it.\" \"Sounds like what we expected. Call when it's safe, and don't do anything stupid Freddy.

Browns waiting in a car, and Blue and Blonde are on crowd control.\" \"And the girl?\" \"I have no idea, have you gotten anything about her?\" \"She's Cabot's daughter, seventeen, nearly failing out of school because of absences. For every long period of time she was out of school, we got evidence on Cabot doing a heist and then going underground.\" \"So she's a part of this for sure.\" \"Exactly, now try and find out how, and why.\"' Saturday 1:57 AM \"Do we have a plan to get her out? We need to get her out!\" \"Back it up Newendyke, what happened?\" \"I bailed out of poker early, figuring it would be a decent enough time to talk to her, she wasn't at the game, but everyone else was. I found her doing math homework, fucking trigonometry homework. I got her talking a bit, and she let a lot of things slide.\" \"Like what?\" \"Mr. Blonde, first name is Vic. I also got her name and her job in all of this, and you're not going to fucking believe it.\" \"What she doing?\" \"She a medic. Full on medic. She's there to stitch up all of the bullet holes. She went on a whole rant about everyone being shot and the cops getting' closer and closer to them.\" \"Does she think one of you are gonna be pegged down?\" \"She's nearly positive it's going to happen. I got some bad news though.\" \"What?\" \"She recognized me.\" \"What!?\" \"From the comic book store, I thought she looked familiar but i couldn't place it. She also thinks there's a rat in the group.\" \"You?\" \"She didn't say.\" \"She's going to bring this up to Joe at some point, so be ready to be questioned.\" \"You think?\" \"If you were a mob-boss's daughter with the feeling of a rat in the heist would you go running to daddy?\" \"Fuck.\" \"Be prepare, that's all I'm saying.

Or living a criminal life. Or knowing the cops are getting closer every day to locking up your family.

You think I didn't see that?\" Mr. Pink cannot keep his eyes from mimicking a frightened cat, wide as can be. He's not well with suppressing those peepers when that tone is directed at him and his nervous twitches show it. It is an unprofessional habit that has almost gotten him knee deep in blue boys, but even they are not as intimidating as Mr. White on a night like this. Drunks are always unpredictable. Still, he could blame it on the rank cigar smoke thickening up his air. \"Does it even really matter?\" He had handed the waitress an arcade coin to shut them up. She was not exactly thrilled. \"It does. Now you promised that you were going to tip. Why the hell wouldn't you? You'll be a rich man by tomorrow!\" Had Pink not addressed this issue already? White is exclaiming and throwing his arms forward in broad gestures, almost hitting the kid beside him. Mr. Pink could feel sorry for him, except that he is pretty sure the kid's a cocksucker for White. It likely would not be the first thing of White's to smack him in his face. Mr. Pink's eyes narrow in irritation and he leans forward to answer with a hissing growl, \"Just announce it to the fucking world why don't you? Stop being so goddamn loud!\" Then he eases back and lifts up his own drink only to swirl the liquid and put it down again. \"And I never promised anything. You've got the wrong guy. Getting this money isn't going to change my stance. I'm conserving it.\" 'Might even invest,' he wants to follow up, but stops himself. That's unnecessary information for this group. \"There's really no point in bringing this up again, Mr. White.\" Before he's even half done with his reply, White is talking to Mr. Blonde. He's a listless drunk, he is, like an indecisive dog surrounded by a hundred bones and that mutt can smell every scrap of meat leftover on them. Which one would he taste next? Which would he drag a sloppy tongue over this evening? The kid, probably. Mr. Pink has gotten a knack for these types of deductions lately. He is no stickler and can take a joke, but all this drunk rambling does not have what it takes to hold his ear so he would rather test his intuition. He looks for the signs that show up in every \"hidden queer.\" Details add up. The pretend detective decides to play a game, beginning with the small hints then getting to the bigger evidence. It is like reading a good mystery novel with a satisfying climax. Pink has not had one of those in a while. Orange's hands are clenching onto the seat edge with every lurching movement of the group. They are all interconnected by the cramped booth; Pink by Brown, Brown by Blue, Blue by Blonde, Blonde by Orange, Orange by White. They are a huffing, perspiring clump of suits. A fucking rainbow. Pink cannot exactly see Mr. Orange's hands because of the table, but he can tell by his narrow plywood arms. It is no clear evidence though, he might just have had one too many and is about to vomit on the table (a consideration that brings much horror to the observer). Though there is also the way he keeps looking at White. White is droning on and on to Blonde, obviously paying the kid no mind even though his arm is clamped around his shoulder, and still the kid keeps eyeballing him. He peers through those puckered lashes and flicks his pupils down towards his lap all in the same instance. Pink classifies it as school girl mentality, which is a bit harsh, but it is not like Pink is writing this exercise down or anything. Soon Mr. Pink realizes that so far, his evidence is one sided. Who is to say this affection is not unrequited? It looks so for now, yet Pink has seen the boiling point of what borderlines decency in public. One evening in the car, White whispered in the kid's ear and whatever that old asshole was saying, it has the kid's hand trembling around his seat belt. So fucking unprofessional. He's positive that the kid is now going red, a madder red to contrast the drunk glow, just from being under White's gaze again. Pink's jaw clenches to bite back a humorless laugh, one of a sadist's victory. Look at him. Turning his head like a modest wife to whine to Blonde about something or another. How does Pink stay so much smarter than these fucks? He can read them like a fucking audio book. It's that easy. He bets he can even foresee this whole operation through. No way could one be a rat with how good he can sniff out their shit. Now they are moving up in a fashion similar to a dismissed parish mass. The mixed conversations have cooled and everyone is just ready to step out into the LA night. They tug at their loose collars with futility and Pink takes the opportunity to see if he can catch one more hint of some homosexuality between his subjects. There is some going on all right, but not to Pink's notion. Instead, White walks ahead in a follow up conversation with Mr. Blue. Orange lingers with Blonde, whose pinky finger is latched into the ass pocket of the kid's pants. Pink is the only one who does not vote up for another round downtown. Now he is just nervous.

Tulips The evening was young and warm; lovely dashes of red, yellow and orange wrapped themselves around the bungalow and the sole figure relaxing on the small porch. Larry Dimick layback enjoying his carefully tended-to bed of tulips, which brought a welcome pallet of colour to the otherwise green and brown tinged garden; he stared into and beyond the flowerbed, a small smile playing across his face as he remembered some distant time when he was known as White and the unexpected, yet welcome splash of colour came in the form of a man called Orange. It had been twenty long years since he and the kid had split after the heist had gone wrong. They split from Blonde, Pink, Brown, Blue – all of them. As soon as the bullets started flying, Freddy had grabbed him dragged him out of the back, bundled him into a car and had driven through the night without a single backward glance. On the road, the poor kid had broken down, telling Larry everything, how he was a cop forced into undercover, but how he'd fallen head over heels for him, how it had started like a slow burn the first time Larry had looked at him and by the first time they'd fucked it was already making love, and how, because of all that, he was willing to leave behind the only life he'd known in order to just exist with him. How could Larry ever deny this beautiful boy, with those heavy lidded green eyes, anything? And whilst his revelation of being a cop cut deep, it was nothing compared with the pain, pure need and heart breaking fragility hidden within those eyes, nor the sacrifice Freddy – his Freddy – had made to be with him. That abandonment of their fellow thieves had marked a new, straight way of life for them both. And in the twenty years since, they had slipped into an easy rhythm: moving from small town to small town, keeping their heads down, not being noticed, taking menial, cash in hand jobs to tide them over and simply enjoying the unquestionable presence of the other. They'd been in this part of Florida for a little over a year and soon it would be time to move on, but as Larry had entered into his seventies the pair had started to slow down and they were now looking for somewhere to settle for good, somewhere to make their own. Larry sighed, coming out of his reverie, he was waiting for his beautiful boy to come home. As much as Larry enjoyed tending his tulip garden and completing the crossword, when the day started to drag, all he could focus on was when Freddy would walk into the garden and melt his heart with that lopsided smile of his. Over the years Larry had watched Freddy grow from that uncertain, skinny youth into a solid, confident man and Larry was certain (rightly or wrongly) that his confidence and acceptance of who he was, was in no small part to the love Larry showed him throughout the years. And Larry was proud of the man Freddy had turned into and proud of the man that he, himself, had become and he could admit to himself (though never to Freddy) that Freddy was only the reason. Larry recognised the noise of Freddy's car engine as the car pulled into the drive and he waited patiently for his lover as he made the way through the house, bags cluttering as dropped things off and changed. Rather than rising, Larry settled for shifting his head to watch Freddy through the kitchen window as he opened the fridge, pulling out two beers. From the way he clattered about, closed the door of the fridge with a touch more force than entirely necessary and scuffed his feet, it was obviously that Freddy was in a foul mood from work. He collapsed into the chair next to Larry, handing him a beer and scowled out at the garden, slouching down at an almost inhuman, and certainly uncomfortable, way. Larry just waited knowing that Freddy would virtually verbally vomit what had been gnawing at him all day and it would be much less painful if he didn't press him. Within seconds Freddy was away, all hands and rapid-fire words and big eyes begging for empathy. Larry struggled to keep his smile under wraps, it wouldn't be well greeted, but even after all this time and all his growth, Freddy was still that adorable kid he was when they'd first met when something rattled his self-confidence. Whilst Freddy was in mid-sentence complaining about some bullshit customer he had to deal with, Larry got up and pulled Freddy out of his chair into an embrace and pressed their lips together. The look on Freddy's face – a mixture of pure joy, disbelief and annoyance – simply made Larry's grin wider and brought a deep chuckle from him. \"Ignore that shitty customer, kid. They don't know shit, you're super cool. Now let's go feast,\" another peck and Larry pulls away, heading towards the kitchen and leaving a slightly gobsmacked Freddy in his wake. Following Larry inside, Freddy retorted \"Watch who you're calling 'kid', old man. Remember who's buying your food!\" this was greeted by another chuckle from Larry, 20 years in and Larry hadn't missed the glint in Freddy's eyes that screamed how much he still loved being called kid. Freddy headed to the work surface, grabbing some potatoes and set to work peeling them, so engrossed in what he was doing, he didn't notice Larry approaching behind him until he pressed himself in Freddy's back. His hands sliding down Freddy's arms, stilling the knife there, Freddy shivered and pressed back against him. Larry simultaneously ground his hips into him and whispered, his voice deep and gravelly, in his ear \"This isn't what I meant when I said let's feast… this can wait.\" ","Summary":" Pairing: Orange/White Disclaimer: I don't own Reservoir Dogs.

Freddy glanced at the clock the moment he heard the two light taps of a car horn, and noted the minute hand of his bedside clock was squarely in the middle of the 12. Punctuality is a sign of trustworthiness, his mother had always told him. The young detective wondered what that said about himself, as he was only half dressed when he rushed down the stairs a few minute later. He jogged across the street with jacket in one hand, tie and belt in the other. The .45 provided by Joe for each of them was awkwardly crammed into his waistband. White laughed in that throaty way of his as Freddy climbed into the car. \"Jesus Christ, kid,\" while tugging on Freddy's unbuttoned shirt. \"You never dressed yourself before or something?\" With a sidelong glance, he surveyed White's outfit. Crisp ironed shirt, silk tie, jacket cut slim and pants tailored to be accommodating of the stocky frame underneath. His gaze must have lingered long enough to be picked up on; Freddy's companion chided him with a, \"Time and place for everything. You should concentrate on getting yourself dressed and not me undressed.\" \"Don't flatter yourself, old man.\" Freddy tried to laugh it off, feeling ridiculous, like having a crush in high school all over again. He pointedly turned his attention to buttoning his shirt, head lowered to hide his face in case it was turning red. White decided he was fumbling too long with the buttons and firmly but gently pushed the kid's hands aside. Freddy was sure that his face was definitely red by now. White's deft fingers did up the buttons, then straightened and smoothed his collar in a series of controlled, smooth motions. It brought to mind Sunday mornings as a child, being dressed for church- a nostalgic, comforting feeling of being cared for. Next, White plucked the tie from his hand and set to work on that. \"C'mon, man, I know how to ti-\" \"Yeah, you probably do a shitty job of it, too,\" White cut off his halfhearted protest. \"There,\" after patting the tie down into place. He surveyed his handiwork. White's ocular scan stopped at Freddy's lap, and the lump in the detective's throat felt like it just grew too big to swallow. \"Holy shit, kid, jeans? You're really wearing jeans?\" Freddy cut him off with a kiss. When he pulled back, feeling a little smug for getting the \"veteran\" to shut up (and a lot smug about White's dilated pupils), Freddy said, \"I'm really fucking looking forward to this job bein' over so you can stop calling me 'kid.'\" The moment it came out of his mouth, Freddy already couldn't understand why the fuck he said it. That was Orange talking. White's face creased into one of his genuine smiles, the ones where even his eyes are smiling and the corners of Freddy's mouth can't help lifting in response to. \"I call 'em like I see 'em.\" He lifted his chin in a gesture toward the offending pants. \"Kid stuff.\" Freddy shrugged. \"Hey, I ain't made of money yet, and it's not like you can tell unless you're lookin' real close... like some sort of pervert or somethin'.\" Freddy loved making White laugh. Sometimes when he really got into it he'd even pound the table, bed, or in this case, the steering wheel. \"You're really rarin' to go today, huh? Too bad I don't have time to play with you. Thanks to waiting on your ass, we're gonna be late if we don't take off now.\" The thief settled for a chaste peck. That slight twinge of disappointment, Freddy attributed that to Orange, too. When they pulled into a spot in the parking lot, Mr. Pink was already there, smoking a cigarette by the front door and frowning. It seemed to be his default facial expression. As the trio walked into the diner, Freddy noted that Pink, too, was wearing jeans, and the Orange in him nudged White's arm with his own and nodded towards Pink's outfit. White definitely noticed, but only responded with, \"Shut up and sit down.\" Freddy felt giddy, like a kid who thought he just told a great joke, and stifled a laugh. The entire meal was surreal. It felt like any other they'd had together, any other shared banal conversation, on any other day. Freddy had the distinct sensation of watching the scene from outside his own body even as Brown prattled on, stringing together pop culture references with profanity like knitting a scar of vulgarities. Even the tightly wound Pink was no more or less tightly wound than usual. Freddy watched out of the corner of his eye as White emptied four packets of sugar into his cream laden coffee and flicked food at Pink with his spoon. Glimpses of an impish side. The man was full of surprises. Freddy's chest tightened for a fraction of a second. When it was time to leave, Orange and White shared a car with Brown and Joe; Pink, Blue, and Blonde rode with Eddie. In the back seat together, White put his hand on top of Freddy's, out of sight of the two in front. A comforting gesture that only served to put the undercover cop increasingly on edge. The clock was ticking, counting down to the problem to which he had no solution. He'd caught White at it, and himself a couple times, too, even, like before breakfast. Talking as though they'd continue seeing each other after the job. Nothing unusual for White, but Freddy... more and more, Orange was interfering with his decision making process. He thought the first time would be the worst mistake he'd ever make on a job, until that mistake kept repeating itself. Maybe it's the thrill, the idea of getting caught, he'd thought at first. Shit like this was dangerous regardless of who found out, maybe that was what made it exciting. But right now, looking over at White's calm expression behind his Wayfarers, mouth working at a toothpick, Freddy admitted that even if it started out that way, that was no longer the case. Being with him felt more like putting on a soft, worn-in leather jacket than a straight adrenaline rush. And that terrified Freddy as much as the possibility of the lid blowing off the whole thing. He thought in circles for a solution and came to the conclusion that the best he could do was beg White to testify against Cabot and put in some good words. Other thoughts, some as crazy as ditching both jobs altogether, or throwing White into the trunk of a car and driving nonstop to Mexico, passed through his mind. Wild fantasies, like the kind he had about being a superhero as a little boy. In comic books then, it was immediately obvious who was the bad guy and who was the good guy. Nowadays in comics, much less real life, it was hard to tell. So here he was. No plan to save the day, and feelings for the bad guy. \"Don't worry kid, you'll do fine,\" White assured him in a low voice while giving his hand a quick squeeze, likely picking up on his tension. Freddy swallowed hard and nodded, afraid his betrayal would show in his eyes, even behind his sunglasses. ","Summary":" As usual, White was right on the dot the morning of the heist.

I got the idea from watching the movie, and, personally, I wanted to see more of Mr. Brown and get into his backstory and add in my own character at the same time. So please no flames. If you don't like it that's fine, just don't be rude about it. If you have any suggestions on how to make it better or if I do something wrong, feel free to PM me or tell me in the reviews. This will go into the movie as well. But the first chapters will be from my own mind. This is kind of a crossover with Pulp Fiction, but is more Reservoir Dogs then anything. Chapter One I met this so called Mr. Brown in 1987. I was brand new to the business, doing odd jobs for Joe and Nice Guy Eddie. If they really needed me, I'd drive the getaway car. But it wasn't until June 17th, 1987 that we actually met. At this point in time, I had been working for Joe and his son for at least six months. Eddie seemed like a pretty okay guy—I never talked to him much. His first words to me were, \"Hey, kid. Put some more cream in this coffee.\" He set the cup down in front of me and walked into his father's office. I did as told and gave it to him. He hadn't said anything to me after that. Not until that day, at least. It was early morning, maybe nine or nine thirty, I wasn't sure. I remember I was having some weird erotic dream that starred myself and a couple of guys, but I don't remember who. Probably some strangers my subconscious had conjured up. Lazily, I reached out and grabbed my phone. It fell off the receiver and hit the floor. \"Ah, you cocksucker.\" I snapped at it. I picked it up and put it to my ear. \"— ello ?\" the voice sounded annoyed. Sounded like I caught this guy in the middle of saying his third or fourth hello. \"Hello? Sorry, my phone fell off the receiver...\" \" Marguerite? Nice Guy Eddie. \" \"Eddie! Holy shit.\" I sat up. \"Hey. Wow, didn't know you had my number.\" \" You wrote it down when you started working for us . Listen. I've got this job for you. Come down to my father's office in one hour, we'll explain more there .\" My eyes lit up. \"You got it.\" I hung up and hopped out of the bed, throwing on some clothes. I wore a green sweater that exposed my left shoulder and light blue jeans. I frizzed my hair as much as it could, until it was a good three inches—the bigger the hair, the closer to God—put on my makeup, with the bright pink blush on my cheek bones, and green eyeshadow to accentuate my eyes—this was an interview, in an odd roundabout sort of way, I needed to look nice—and made sure my Converse were tied before quickly slipping them on. I grabbed the car keys to my blue 1974 Pontiac Firebird Formula 400—my father had given this to me in his will when he passed away two years ago, and it really pissed off my brothers—and ran out to my car. My hands were sweaty. I was so nervous, you wouldn't believe. This could be my first big job. I had no time to fuck this up. If I did, only the Lord would know what would happen. I drove off as Journey blasted through my speakers. I bit my lip, trying to go as fast as I could without going the speed limit. When I parked, I got out of the car and hurried inside without looking so excited or nervous. I looked at my watch. 10:00 on the dot. I quickly pulled out my compact and looked at my hair. I fixed it a little and then put my mirror up. Taking in a deep breath, I shut my eyes to calm down before putting my hand firmly on the doorknob. Remember, Margie. Firm handshake. That'll show 'em that you mean business. My father's advice rang through my head as I opened the door. The sound of laughter reached my ears. Four men, Eddie being one of them, were in the office. The oldest, Joe, sat behind his desk. He was practically bald, except what little hair he had that was on the sides, and back, of his head. And that was sheet white. He was a big guy, not huge but you could tell he hadn't missed too many meals. Eddie was sitting on the corner of Joe's desk, his hands relaxed on his knee. His hair was either some kind of light brown or dark blonde—I was never exactly sure—and he wore this purple and light blue jacket, that was horrible looking to me, and jeans with a white t-shirt. I looked to the left and a man with jet black hair and a smirk on his face sat there. He was dressed nice, with what looked like some kind of expensive t-shirt and jeans and dress shoes. Never had I seen a man wear nice, black shoes with jeans. Looking to the right, there was a man with dark brown hair that reached his chin. He had a sort of excited, boyish smile on his face that was, in my opinion, kind of cute. He wore just casual clothes that any Average Joe would wear, and it looked as if his tennis shoes had seen better days, the bottoms were so worn. The front of the left shoe was kind of hanging off. It was obvious he messed with it. Hell I would too. \"Marguerite. Right on time.\" Eddie gestured to the empty chair between the two men I didn't know. \"Sit down, we'll get to business.\" I nodded and sat down. I placed my hands on my knees, sitting up straight. Up straight, Margie, that's a good girl . My mother's snobbish voice nagged. I refrained from rolling my eyes. Doing it here and now would be pretty bad. \"Marguerite, this is Vic Vega,\" Nice Guy Eddie motioned to the man on the left. \"He's been with us for a while and a...\" He searched for the words. \"A good luck charm for any jobs we get.\" \"Hey there.\" Vic gave a half smile and extended his hand. I took it, giving my best, firm handshake. \"Hi.\" I smiled softly. \"And this is Nate Collins. Referred to us by Vic.\" I looked at the other man, who smiled and shook my hand. We locked eyes for a moment before I smiled softly and looked away. \"Now listen.\" Joe, the older man in the room, spoke in his gruff voice. \"This job is important. You can't fuck this up.\" He looked at each of us. I tapped my hands on my knees to some song stuck in my head. I could tell what it was—it was the chorus—and I tried not to make it obvious what I was doing. \"Miss Bellamy. Quit that.\" \"Sorry.\" I clasped my hands together. Nate chuckled quietly. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Vic smirk a little. \"Now, there's this guy. His name's Quincy Wilson. He owes Dad money.\" Eddie stood and clasped his hands behind his back, earning himself an air of premature sophistication. After all, this guy had to be early to mid-twenties. Now, if it was Joe doing that, it would be more than welcome. \"How much money we talking about?\" I crossed my legs. \"Fifteen thousand dollars.\" Quietly, Vic whistled once. \"Jesus Christ.\" Nate shook his head. \"So I'm guessing you want us to go find this motherfucker and go Godfather on his ass.\" I messed with my nails. \"Only if he can't pay it. If he can, just beat him up a little. Give him a black eye. If not, well...\" Eddie looked over at Vic, who was smirking. \"You know what to do.\" There was a little silence as Eddie walked around to get a cigarette from the other side of his father's desk. After he lit his, he continued. \"This fucker lives 225 West Avenue, Hollywood.\" As he said this I quietly said it to myself to remember. \"He goes to work from 9:30 in the morning and comes home around 6:00 in the evening. After that he reads the evening paper, jacks off to a couple of pornos, and then goes to get ready for bed. I suggest you go during one of the more vulnerable times.\" \"You mean when he's jacking off?\" Vic raised his eyebrows. \"You could.\" I started to laugh, this guy's face in my mind when we bust in the door and he's got his tallywacker hanging out for the world to see. \"What's so funny?\" Joe snapped. I calmed down a little. \"Can you imagine this guy's face? It'll be fucking priceless.\" \"And this is why we're arriving at that exact time.\" Vic smirked. Eddie shook his head, a smile on his face. \"You go tomorrow evening. Vincent will meet you at the diner across the street of that motherfucker's house.\" \"Who's Vincent?\" I raised an eyebrow. \"My little brother. We usually work together.\" Vic explained. \"Trust me. He's just as good as Vic on these jobs.\" Eddie nodded. \"Keeps his cool better than him too.\" Joe teased. Vic made a face. Nate chuckled quietly. He leaned in close to whisper in my ear. \"I think Vincent's better, but don't tell anyone.\" He said, only to where I could hear it. I nodded and he sat back, looking over at Vic for half a second and then out the window. Yeah, it was safe to say that I had a crush on Nate Collins right from the start.

Freddy had woken up in a bad mood after having that dream (again) about some warehouse and some sort of heist gone wrong . Freddy had gotten shot by some civilian woman, and he killed her, and Larry was killing cops right and left.. And many of their friends had died along the way in the dream, too. The ending was particularly jarring, shaking him awake with a panicked shout. Larry had been trying to make Freddy feel better all day after that, but nothing was working. But when it was nearly dinnertime, he suggested ice cream for dinner, to which the kid replied with a grin and a frantic search for the car keys. But when Larry turned around with vanilla ice cream in his hands, and Freddy with chocolate, their peaceful shopping trip turned ridiculous. \"Oh. I thought we were getting vanilla..\" Larry smiled, but Freddy responded with a very sharp and quick, \"No.\" before he tried to immediately shove the tub of ice cream into the cart. Larry moved fast, shoving his own ice cream underneath, pushing Freddy's hands upwards. \"Now hold on kid, we should make up our minds about this first.\" \" Make up our minds ?! My mind's made up already, old man . I'm not eating vanilla ice cream. It's bullshit! \" Freddy complained, and Larry's brows quirked at 'old man'. \"Listen, kid , calm the fuck down, it's just dessert !\" Larry shouted, frustrated by his kid's behaviour. \"Yea, but I still gotta eat it !\" The younger shouted back, and by now they were getting an awful lot of looks from the people around them. Larry was sometimes stunned at the moments when their age gap would rear its head. This was definitely one of them. He turned around, putting the vanilla and chocolate back, and turning back with another kind. \"Why don't we just get Neapolitan?\" He suggested, sounding sheepish as he cooled down. Freddy scoffed. \" Neapolitan ?! We are no t getting that shit! What are we?! OLD PEOPLE ?!\" He cried, and Larry was silent for a moment, waiting to catch the kid's eye. When he did, Freddy's eyes widened and his ears went red. \"N-Not like that Larry, jesus!\" He tried to save face, blushing and looking away. Larry tried to reason with his brat. \"Listen, kid, Neapolitan is a good substitute for what we both want.\" \"No, Larry, Neapolitan is not a good substitute for shit.\" Freddy kept standing his ground, and it made Larry go cold with shame when he realized how much Freddy must have looked like his spoiled kid. God fucking damnit. Fucking age gaps, man. \"Kid look-\" \"No you look-\" \"Neapolitan is the only way we can settle this-\" \"BULLSHIT, LARRY. NEAPOLITAN IS GROSS -\" \"FREDDY STOP FUCKIN FIGHTING WITH ME OVER ICE CREAM!\" \" FUCK YOU !\" Freddy shouted, but then he crossed his arms over his chest and looked off to the side, pouting and looking with regret at his own words. There were even more eyes on them now. Larry sighed and turned back to the ice cream freezer, putting the dread Neapolitan back and grabbing chocolate vanilla swirl, which he had not seen earlier, instead. \"How about we try this?\" He suggested, smiling. Freddy's hands fell from his earlier stubborn stance and he placed them against the rim of the cart. \"Oh.\" Freddy blinked, face smoothing out. \"Yea.. okay fine.\" He muttered, blushing again. Larry laughed, placing the tub into the cart and cupping Freddy's blushing face and kissing him on the cheek. The younger placed his hand over Larry's and stroked the back of it shyly. \"That was fuckin' stupid.\" He laughed, and Larry kissed him again, ruffling his hair before grabbing the cart and walking toward the check-out with Freddy in tow.

I don't own \"Reservoir Dogs.\" Mr. Pink knew he was dead and strongly suspected he was in Hell. He knew he was dead because the pain was gone, and he was in a strange void of bright whiteness. He suspected this wasn't Heaven, because the angel staring down at him was butt-ass ugly. Granted, \"ugliness\" was subjective; but surely if this were Heaven, the angel to greet him would be tailored to his personal idea of \"beauty:\" petite build, cute features; black, white, pretty much any race would do; not \"bubbly,\" but with a hint of spunk. The broad staring down at him was a moose, with a big mannish face, lips too long and wide for Pink's taste, squinty eyes, blonde hair that looked like it hadn't seen a hairbrush in way too long, and…holy god, that chin. No female should ever be cursed with a chin like that. Actually, she looked vaguely familiar. Like someone he'd seen around every other day. Someone who really never rubbed him right. Who the hell was she? The gunshot victim was regaining consciousness, and Lindsey Braxton was the only nurse in the room. She had no idea what she was going to say to him. When the paramedics had rushed him into the E.R. (unconscious), people said he was a criminal who'd been shot trying to resist the police, and that was all the information Lindsey had been able to get out of anyone. She had no idea how much sympathy she should be showing this guy; he could be a petty thief, worthy of all the sympathy she had, or a child-rapist, who deserved to be smothered with his own pillow. The distress on his face yanked at Lindsey's compassion, and she sincerely hoped whatever crime he'd been arrested for wasn't unforgivable. \"H-Hey,\" Lindsey began, as the guy blinked up at her, panting. \"You awake?\" Those eyes, where had she seen them before? She knew this guy. Those clear blue eyes, sitting in those undead-looking sockets. Those awful teeth. Where did she know him from? Weakly, he breathed, \"…I dead?\" \"No,\" Lindsey said, as clearly as she could. \"You're not dead. You've been given painkillers, so that might be what you're experiencing.\" He closed his eyes and gave a soft laugh. With difficulty, he spoke again. \"I knew…angles…wouldn't be that fuckin' ugly.\" It took Lindsey a second to work out what he'd just said. When she did, she remembered who he was. All the patience and empathy drained from Lindsey's voice and face. Flatly she said, \"Oh my god it's you.\" His eyes flew opened, and he looked over at her nervously. \"Do I know you?\" he managed. \"I'm one of the 'broads' who brings you your coffee and waffles every other weekend. You know, the ones you never tip.\" His face contorted into a strange combination of angry defiance, and Oh, crap. Lindsey worked part-time at the hospital, unable to get fulltime hours. To make ends meet, she had another job at a family restaurant, bussing and waitressing. She did everything she was supposed to: smiled, asked customers if they wanted anything extra, and at least tried to remember to check up on each table. Her tips were usually mediocre; she wasn't like her friend Renee, who just had that magical ability to seem bubbly and natural every time she spoke to anyone. With Lindsey, you could usually tell that she was just being polite. Well, Renee probably wouldn't have so much extra energy either, if she'd had a rowdy six-year-old boy to raise. But God help you if you ever brought your kid up as a reason. It wasn't exactly that people chastised Lindsey for it; aside from the occasional prudish snob, most people were pretty forgiving of the fact that Lindsey had gotten knocked up at nineteen, especially since she'd gone on to nursing school, taking care to turn her life around. The problem was that, from there, it would just be an aggravating chain of unwanted questions. (\"Well, can't your parents help you out?\" \"I don't want to keep living with my parents, I don't want my kid living with my parents, I want us to have our own place.\" \"Why? Are your parents abusive?\" \"No, I just don't get along with them.\" \"Why?\" \"None of your fucking business!\" Except you could never say that last part to a customer or a patient.) Even now, Lindsey felt somewhat trapped, because she still had to live close enough for her parents to drive back and forth, so they could watch Trevor while she was at work. She was far too attached to her son to ever fantasies about winding back history and undoing it; but the constant contact with her parents—and having to leave Trevor there, with her mother's yowling temper and her dad's cynical, quasi-racist attitude—she didn't like it. But no way in hell was she going to try to get out the easy way, by buying lottery tickets, or waiting on \"Mr. Right.\" Too many friends and coworkers of hers had done that, and the results were never good. The ones who looked to a man to save them usually ended up with another kid, and abandoned by the father, yet again. Fuck that. There were kind people in the world. People like Lindsey's parents, who watched her son for her, despite all the bad blood between them. People like that cute old couple who came to the restaurant every Sunday after church, and left her great tips. Or her manager Don, who'd go easy on her when he knew she was having a rough day. And then there were people like this douche nozzle. The prick who never tipped, unless the waitress was \"special,\" whatever the hell that meant. She'd caught enough of his snide remarks, when he'd thought she or her co-workers were out of earshot. According to him, Lindsey was \"one of the ugly ones\" (like he should talk), and her smile was \"fake.\" \"So what're you gonna do now,\" the guy asked in that insufferable nasally voice. \"Pull my plug?\" \"No way.\" Lindsey left his bed and took a seat in the nearby chair. \"I'd get fired. And maybe arrested.\" \"Perfect, we can share a jail cell.\" He leaned back in the bed and closed his eyes. Lindsey gave him a look. \"I don't think—wait, now I think of it, yeah, they probably would send you to the women's prison. They'd at least be stumped for a while.\" \"Aren't you clever.\" He shifted in his hospital bed. \"I'm sorry I don't look like Harrison Ford. Let me guess, you heard there was a criminal who got a gunshot wound, and hurried in to volunteer, expecting some kind of lovable rogue?\" \"I expected a patient whose first words out of his mouth wouldn't be how ugly I am. And who tips.\" He groaned. \" Christ , you get how many tips every day for a job you get paid to do, and you're cryin' because one guy who pays his bills won't give you a little extra? Listen honey, I worked a minimum wage job, and I didn't ever get no tips—\" \"What kind of job?\" she snapped. \"One that requires you to work fast-paced, memorize five tables worth of orders or write them all down in a 'timely' manner, deliver food in a 'timely' manner without spilling, and do it all with a giant smile? You do all that at once? While raising a kid? Mr. …what'd you say your name was?\" \"I didn't.\" She sighed inwardly. \"I guess I'll find out when I read the newspapers, after they lock you up.\" \"Yeah, so karma caught up with me, for not tipping the waitress. You happy?\" \"Immensely.\" But she wasn't happy. And honest to god, Lindsey couldn't put her finger on why. She had the upper had here. God, this douche bag's life was about to be ruined beyond repair; she was officially infinitely better off than this asshole who'd treated her like human garbage so many times. And she didn't even have to feel guilty about this schadenfreude; she could gloat and had a right to. Because he'd done this to himself , probably with some morally reprehensible act. She suddenly remembered she had no idea what his crime was. \"What'd you do?\" She was careful to keep the edge out of her voice. \"You kill someone? Rape someone?\" He snorted. \"Don't get your hopes up Doll. I stole some diamonds.\" He wrinkled his nose at the ceiling bitterly. \"And I woulda' pulled it off, if I wasn't doing it with a bunch of unprofessional fuck-tards who thought it'd be a great idea to bring a bona fide psychopath along.\" He sighed weakly. Lindsey remembered that it was her job to keep him medicated. \"Do you need more painkillers?\" she asked, as diplomatically as she could. He shook his head. \"No, I'm not in any physical pain. It's just the existential horror's kicking in.\" She liked how he worded that. She liked a lot of the ways he worded things. If only she could meet a guy who did that without being such a self-centered ass. That was when she realized why she wasn't happy about this situation. She was just pissed by the reminder that there were no decent guys around. None that were her type anyway. She'd never allow herself to become one of those pricks who blamed all their romantic woes on the opposite sex; but she'd come to discover that finding a guy who was a proper balance between interesting and reliable was next to impossible. In high school she'd gone for the interesting guys, and wound up an abandoned single mom. So then she'd tried nice guys, and wound up dating a string of men she had little in common with, who bored her to tears, and who often ended the relationship by coming out of the closet. (One of her ex-boyfriends was now her ex- girlfriend . Just her luck.) And every once in a while, there'd come along a cute mousey guy, who wasn't masculine or threatening, but who still had a decent amount of testosterone, and wouldn't you know it, he'd be married; or have the wrong ideals; or too closely match the conventional idea of \"attractive\" so she'd have to get in line. Or, like this guy, they'd just turn out to be colossal losers and assholes. \"How old's your kid.\" She blinked out of her silent rant and looked back at her patient. \"What?\" \"I said how old's your kid.\" He was staring at the wall. \"Why do you ask?\" \"Cuz I'm probably gonna spend the rest of my life in jail and this is the last conversation I'll have with an actual normal human being, so you can just humor me, okay?\" Lindsey scratched at itch on her face, thinking her response over. \"He's just started kindergarten.\" He made an acknowledging sound. \"You have any kids?\" she asked him. \"Not that I know of.\" He frowned at her. \"You say your kid just started kindergarten?\" When she confirmed it, he asked, \"How old are you?\" Lindsey was all too used to that question. \"Twenty-five. Spent the last five years turning my life around, after my son's dad took off.\" She half-expected some cruel retort from him, but instead his blue eyes just darted away, his mouth moving in an uncomfortable grimace. Her anger at him was beginning to mellow out. She found herself actually pitying him, just a little. \"I never got to talk to an actual, real live criminal before.\" Lindsey said abruptly, causing him to look back at her. \"How'd you get shot, if you don't mind my asking?\" He glanced inadvertently at his chest. \"I tried running. Driving, actually.\" His bony hand passed over his mouth, and he worked to organize his thoughts. \"We were hiding out—this right after the robbery. Apparently all the other guys thought a great way to end a conversation's by shooing each other. It was an actual fucking Mexican standoff!\" He became more animated as delved into his long, wild story. And none of it sounded exaggerated or rehearsed. He told it out of order, forgetting some parts, and having to jump back and explain various details. He seemed almost as surprised by some of the turns his story took as Lindsey was. When his story was finished, it posed more questions about his life, and the criminal underworld, and that led to more stories. A lot of it he was reluctant to talk about, but the stuff he did reveal…wow. Then he started asking Lindsey about herself again, and she began telling stories, recounting memories she usually only shared with friends or particularly chatty customers. And under his dickishness, he seemed to be listening with a sad, tranquil sincerity. By midnight, Lindsey came to the reluctant conclusion that there was no way in hell she was letting this one get away; for what a dick he was, she was going to give him a chance. Any other prick, hell no; but this time she'd make an exception. \"How late do you work tonight?\" he asked curiously. She glanced at the clock. \"Another half-hour, probably.\" He made a face. \"Well thanks for a decent conversation, I guess. It's nice to talk to someone without having to worry about them pulling a gun on you.\" As an afterthought, he added, \"Feel free to write me in prison.\" Lindsey eyed him dubiously. \"I'll kind of need a name for that.\" He looked hesitant. He probably wasn't used to telling anyone his real name. \"Randall Valentine,\" he said finally. \"You make that up just now?\" \"Why would I make it up?\" he asked, squinting almost angrily. \"I'm headed for the big house anyway. The cops all know who I am now.\" Lindsey responded with an animated shrug. \"Maybe you're planning some kind of escape?\" He scoffed. \"Because that worked so well last time.\" Lindsey sighed, and tugged her ear. \"Look…I don't know how police procedure works when a guy they arrested's in the hospital. But no one bothered to give me any details. So for all they know, for all I know you're just another random patient.\" His eyes narrowed, as he worked to follow what she was implying. \"I mean, far as I know, there's no law against offering to take a patient home. And no one's gonna pry if I don't take him directly home, you get my drift…\" He was out of the bed before she'd even finished talking. \"Where're my clothes?\" he asked, searching the room almost frantically. She pointed to a counter, where his clothes sat folded up. God, hospital gowns were a form of abuse unto themselves. No one looked good in them. Randall Valentine in a hospital gown kind of reminded her of a naked mole rat in a dress (for some reason). She didn't blame him for stalling on freedom the few extra minutes it took to get dressed. \"Do you mind?\" \"Sorry.\" She averted her eyes. After a few moments he suddenly exclaimed, \"What the hell happened to my shirt?\" He was wearing the pants from the day he'd been shot. He held his undershirt, still stained with blood. The shirt hung open, cut clean down the middle. Lindsey's eyebrow crept up. \"What, you think they're gonna postpone surgery on a gunshot victim so they can carefully take all your clothes off?\" His large eyes traveled around the room exasperatingly. Finally, he threw the shirt on backwards, tied the top and bottom shut, and buttoned his black suit top over it. \"Good enough.\" He threw on his socks and shoes, and they headed out the door. \"I'll pay you back for this, I promise.\" \"Yeah, yeah, come on.\" She led him out through the back, and into the parking lot. She was already asking herself what the fuck she was doing, helping a wanted fugitive escape justice; helping a patient leave the hospital without checking out; what she'd say to her employers the next day (much less the police). Whatever, she told herself, cross that bridge when you come to it. You'll think of something. He'll think of something. He's a pro at this, he knows how to disappear, doesn't he? She drove him home to her rat-hole apartment. Not quite sure what was proper etiquette for hosting a fugitive, she simply treated Randall Valentine like any other guest: reminded him her son was asleep before leading him inside, letting him take off his shoes, and offering him a drink. \"I'll take anything alcoholic,\" he said. \"And not to intrude on your hospitality, but I am famished .\" She pinched two beers from the fridge, and stuck a frozen pizza in the oven. They talked some more. Worked out a story for her to tell the cops, and her employers. (She was \"off her meds,\" and \"under lots of stress,\" and making sure her patient was checked out before driving him home had just slipped her mind.) \"You got a location in mind,\" Randall asked between bites of pizza, \"for when you last saw me?\"' \"Jackson Street, between one-thirty and two.\" Lindsey replied without missing a beat. \"I dropped you off, and you said you could walk the rest of the way from there. There's no lights anyone could've seen you with.\" \"Except your supposed car lights. Guess we'll just have to hope no one was peeking out their window between one-thirty and two.\" \"If they did one of us is just remembering wrong, simple as that.\" Randall chuckled through his odd teeth. \"You're good at this. You should help fugitives more often.\" \"I'd consider it. But I'm kind a busy, got a boy to raise. Hopefully who won't grow up to be a fugitive. No offense.\" \"None taken.\" After a moment of awkward silence, Randall said abruptly, \"You know you're not really ugly, right?\" Lindsey knew she'd be a hypocrite to call him out on this obvious flattery; she hadn't just invited him home to hide him from the cops and feed him pizza. Still, she couldn't resist. \"You were saying, about not wanting to intrude on my hospitality?\" He stared wearily at her. \"Look, I'm male. That's not the point. I don't suck up to people when I wanna fuck them. I just ask them if they wanna go to the bedroom and fuck. I never bought into all that fake romantic bullshit. I want to make this real clear. Whether I want to fuck you tonight is a separate issue from whether I think you're ugly.\" \"And you've changed your mind.\" \"Yeah, maybe I have.\" \"I don't look like a, how'd you put it that one time,\" she tried to recall the insult she'd caught him saying once, at the diner, \"a cow that stuck its head in the hay?\" He chewed his pizza slowly. \"…truth, I seen a few cows that were adorable.\" He explained, \"My grandma took me to a petting zoo sometimes when I was a kid.\" His eyes flicked to her hair. \"As for the hay, I just figured you could do something with a few of those split ends. But I know you got a kid and everything now, you don't have time to make yourself up like a supermodel every day.\" He rubbed his face. \"God. Now that I think of it, maybe I am a tiny bit of an asshole. I've been told that…\" Deciding to give him a break from the guilt, Lindsey said, \"I'm told I'd clean the floor in a bitch contest.\" Randall honestly couldn't say what had changed. The same features that had repulsed him at first sight were sexy now. He didn't have to close his eyes and imagine Christie Love (his default for emergencies). He was actually attracted. Her saving his life probably had something to do with it. Finding out she possessed a devil-may-care attitude akin to his probably helped too. He honestly couldn't put his finger on it. After ten or fifteen minutes, Lindsey finally talked Randall into using a condom. She pointed out that not using one would leave \"evidence\" inside of her, possibly allowing the police to confirm she'd helped him escape. It was a flimsy excuse, but he decided to let her have it. He couldn't blame her for being cautious; the last thing the poor woman needed now was a second kid out of wedlock, by a wanted felon. Well condom or not, it was some good, enthusiastic sex. \"I'm not gonna see you again, am I,\" she asked, stroking his hair. They were still on the couch, and Lindsey was using Randall as a mattress. He had his arms wrapped around her, paying absentmindedly with her hair. \"Probably not.\" He added, \"But who knows.\" \"Where you gonna go?\" \"Far as I fucking can. Christ, I'll have to come up with some money. Without attracting more cops.\" \"Don't look at me.\" she said warningly. \"I wasn't gonna ask you…\" She shook her hair out, and leaned her head against his thin chest. \"You could get a job.\" \"Where?\" \"I know a few places around here are hiring. Jack Rabbit Slim's, I know.\" \"What for?\" \"Waiters.\" He let out a long, winded groan. \"You're just fucking with me.\" \"Am not. Look into it. Call them tomorrow. If you work there you'll be wearing a costume, so people won't recognize you. Come to think of it, that'd probably be the perfect place for you to work, while you're saving up for your big getaway.\" Unfortunately, she was right. It was perfect. Perfect job. Perfect karma. The cops ate up Lindsey's story, as did her boss, and Randall got the job at Jack Rabbit Slim's. Obviously he used some fake name to get hired, but Lindsey had no idea what it was; not that it mattered, since she \"didn't know him.\" (She also had no idea where he'd gotten fresh clothes for the job interview, or the painkillers and bandages needed for his gunshot wound. She figured she didn't want to know.) On her way home from work one day, she stopped by the fifties-themed restaurant, and innocently wormed some information out of one of the workers, about a certain member of their new staff. That Friday, she decided Trevor had been a particularly good boy that week, and took him out for a milkshake at Jack Rabbit Slim's. Trevor requested one of the booths shaped like a '50s car, and Lindsey requested the Buddy Holly waiter. For a moment, Lindsey feared she'd got the wrong night; he was that unrecognizable in his costume. Randall was downplaying his voice, speaking softly, and working to hide his New York accent. The glasses and crazy wig overshadowed the eyes and teeth that normally gave him away, but when she looked carefully, it was definitely him. When he saw her, his jaw dropped a little, and he was a split-second away from blurting out \"Hi!\" before catching himself. She allowed her lips to rise to a tiny smile, just briefly. \"What can I get for you two?\" They ordered one five-dollar shake to split, \"Amos and Andy.\" While she and her son sipped and talked and watched all the funny going-ons in the unique restaurant, Lindsey stole glances at Randall, as much as she could. For all she knew, this was the last time she'd see him. He seemed humbled, in this new position, taking orders quietly, with downcast eyes. And she knew it wasn't just his fear of being recognized that was to blame. There was really a sense of poetic justice, here. On one of his trips back from the kitchen, Marilyn Monroe stopped \"Buddy Holly,\" and pointed at Lindsey and Trevor's table. The gesture wasn't accusing; Marilyn just seemed to be telling her co-worker that one of his tales looked like they wanted his attention. He glanced over his shoulder and locked eyes with Lindsey, his lips tightening into something not quite a smile. He returned to their \"car\" with the cheer of a waiter just checking up on his customers. \"How's the shake?\" Trevor declared, \" Awesoooome! \" Lindsey folded her hands under her chin. \"Delicious. I might even leave a tip.\" A/N: This time I actually made an effort to craft the OC love interest for the character, rather than making her a self-insertion (which I will totally admit to doing in a certain other fic). Lindsey is not based on anyone in particular; but, I do have a few close friends who are single mothers that have turned to nursing as a career. Lindsey's physical appearance was based off actress Daryl Hannah, and the daughters of actor Bruce Willis; people online have cited the latter as being \"ugly,\" but I venomously disagree. I think both those girls are unique and pretty. (Their dad, on the other hand, not so much. *Shudder.*) ","Summary":" A/N: I gave this an edit, to fix some typos, and one gaping blooper.

Here's what it's like; it's like bumping your elbow on some cute stranger's tit in a crowded subway. You don't mean to do it, you're perfectly mortified, but your elbow is thanking you. Or else it's like going to cross your legs under the lunch table and finding you've hooked an ankle over someone else - a friend, maybe. And they just leave it there, and they just keep talking, and it's up to you to decide whether or not to move. It's comfortable and it's extremely awkward at the same time, is what this is. It's nothing like yawning and reaching over to get your arm around your girl, no, 'cos that's not accidental at all - and White is way too cool for shit like that anyway. If he wanted to cop a feel he'd probably just say so. You think that might be his gentlemanly M.O., at least, but then again, you happen ta think a lot of things. What you do not think, however, is that White is doing any of this on purpose . He probably doesn't even know what kind of affect it can have on a guy like you, when one ankle has strayed under the other as the group readjusts to all fit around that bar table. When the warm press of his thigh betrays the hard muscle of a man who might actually use his legs to actually take him places. You suck your cigarette down the wrong way when Brown cracks a particularly ribald joke about the Mayor of LA. You knew the Mayor's wife, for chrisakes. White, like it's the most natural thing in the world, reaches over to pat the center of your back until you stop coughing. Slap, slap, heavy palm on dull black leather. He's not even paying attention while he does this, talking up at the waitress for a coffee to follow this last round of beers. When the waitress leaves, White settles his hand where it lands, bracing you like someone might steady their dog on the furniture. You lean back like everything was fucking daisies, nodding at Pink's half-hearted concern. White's elbow props back against the booth, fist curled between your shoulderblades. With each word of the argument with Joe, White's fist gives a small tap forward, a little punch, rough and playful like you're is just some kid brother. Carefully swallowing your beer, you a better glance over at White. He's sprawled back, relaxed, in serious violation of your personal space. Not like that was anything, though - hell the group was all squashed together to keep your voices down an' your faces out of the public eye. Or maybe it was just the nature of the crook to be drunk and friendly. You weren't going to count it as a loss, if they so easily accepted you into the ranks. And, you know. It was all just sort of an accident, anyway. A matter of circumstance. A coincidence. White, see, White is the kind of guy you might go for, if you ever had any time to browse LA's scene. He might be a little bit older than what usually draws your eye, sure, but he more than makes up for that with conversational charm. And - despite the covert nature of your operations - he was an open book, was White. Easy-going and dry with the humor. It was a shame, too, because, you know, you went to school for profiling, for fuck's sake; it didn't take your every power of deduction to understand this guy was flying the same damn flag as you, but, you know. A damn shame. Because it's like this, see, it's like walking into a room and knowing the cologne in the air. You can pick out the aftershave behind the cigarillo smoke, and a layer under that there's fresh-ironed cotton and heat and salt and, y'know, musk . The smoke and the booze can't hide it. Your own jacket hardly hides your body's response, when the sweat of you loses the tang of anxiety and pulls up with the fragrant leather to go neck-and-neck for fuck-me vibes. You're all sweating, sure, red in the nose with drink and laughing and opening collars in the hot press of this backstreet California dive. It's tripping into a stranger on the subway, is what it's like. Your body is singing a lament to your fucking wedding ring while you just wanna to double over and apologize and maybe go find yourself a cab home already. White's attention drifts over to you like an iceberg, full and unstoppable. \"You catch the game last night?\" Your mind races for the tail end of the conversation going around the table. \"Uh,\" a blink. Blame it on the beer. \"The baseball game?\" You sit up straighter. You do like baseball, you just haven't had any time to sit down and enjoy a game in a long while. White's eyes light up over the rim of his coffee mug. His fist closes over your far shoulder and he gives a tug. Chuckling, he sets his cup carefully to the table. Then his attention is back on you, zip, and his smile does a suddenly weird thing to the pit of your stomach, pow . \"Never thought I'd get to see it, the day the Brewers started winning me money again. Shit,\" White looks over your meager crowd. \"Like a crisis of faith, these last three seasons. Then bam , outta nowhere, Varnes and Crowley take it to the fences.\" White shrugs back against the booth, chuckling. Joe is congratulatory and at the same time wants to know how much White won off the bet already. White rounds off a figure, but it's no safe assumption that a few fellas what might owe him will skip out. You listen carefully for any name drops, smile quirking up when White frowns a question your way. It's just a matter of circumstance, is what it is. You settle back with your beer, heel tucked up on the edge of the booth seat, one elbow hanging lazily over your knee. Casual cool. White's arm is just behind your neck, heat and scent and the colorful splash of hibiscus print on a short sleeve. You knock back the last swig off a beer, hair tickling the inside of White's elbow. You lean forward, right, to find a clear spot on the table to deposit the empty beer and by the time you're relaxin' back again White's arm is half caught on the withdraw. You startle up, both feet hit the floor and you don't make it past the apology before White's arm is tightening behind you, like. Curling around your waist. It's a brief squeeze to pull you outta the way so as to let Nice Guy out to 'powder his nose', and White's arm has tripped and found itself under your jacket and it's awkward and it's comfortable and you swallow audibly and pick up someone else's beer. White isn't even paying attention. He's bragging about the baseball game, laughing at Blonde's dry rejoinders. Blondie catches your eye and winks and for no reason at all this makes your skin go hot. You light a cigarette just to prove to the room that you can do so with steady hands. . x . ","Summary":" . x .

L'alliance est aussi pour ça, éviter les occasions. Superflu, avait-il pensé. Ce n'est pas comme si Freddy s'intéressait aux criminelles, ou aux femmes en général. Ce n'est pas comme s'il avait pu imaginer l'affection de Mr White, protectrice et tendre, et ses attentions toujours délicates, de moins en moins ambiguës pourtant. Si, cela était peut-être envisageable. L'inconcevable est l'estime qu'il arrive à avoir pour ce criminel, pas seulement pour son intelligence et sa compétence, mais pour son sens de l'honneur, sa générosité, son calme et son élégance. Il pourrait dire qu'il est hétérosexuel, il pourrait mentionner sa femme. Que serait une tromperie, un mensonge de plus ?

Well, this is my first ever Reservoir Dogs fic- I hope you like it! This is set before the heist ^^ Enjoy….. The bar was bright, noisy and hazy with smoke. Freddy coughed into the back of his hand; yes he smoked, and on difficult cases he had been known to smoke up to five packs a day- but even this was making him feel sick. The room was full of smoky purple and red lights, and the smell of alcohol stuck to everything. Freddy was sitting alone in a booth, one hand cupped round an empty pint glass. The leather seat was slick with perspiration and spilt beer, and Freddy was seriously regretting his agreement to drink in this dive- but Mr White had insisted, and who was Freddy to argue? The man in question was just coming back to the table, a bottle of beer in one hand, and a tumbler or Bourbon in the other; his drink of choice. Freddy never understood Whisky; the need to drink it so much, the way it seemed to make the people who drank it violent and messy, or regretful and morose. One drink seemed to create too many problems; Freddy was sticking to beer, even when he grew to sixty and it was seen as socially acceptable to drink it. On the other hand, this liquid did seem to have the marvellous quality of making a man's tongue loose, very loose…..and tonight Freddy was counting on it. Mr White walked back to the booth, only staggering a little. 'Here you are, kid…..number…..' 'Four.' Finished Freddy, clinking his bottle with the older man as he sat opposite him. 'Four? Huh, seems we had more….' Mr White frowned, but he drank nonetheless, the chink of ice against his teeth sounded loud and clear. 'It's this place, makes you feel fucking drunk before you've even had one!' Freddy chuckled, taking a swig and looking around. 'Hey watch it, I drink here all the time, and there's nothing fucking wrong with this place!' Mr White snapped, before he chuckled as Freddy put a hand up as if apologising. 'If you say so, although it's not my type of place….' Freddy grinned, shaking his head and sitting back. 'Oh yeah? Where do you drink then? Somewhere fucking posh with squashy seats and girls giving you lap dances every five seconds?' 'There's a place round here like that?!' Freddy sat up, looking around as if to spot it. Mr White burst into laughter, shaking his head at the joke. 'Kid, you crack me up.' He muttered, before taking another gulp of Whisky. Freddy grinned, happy he was getting somewhere with this crook- if he could keep up the rapport between them, this case was already half done. He looked up to see Mr White staring at him in the half-light, a strange look on his face. 'What?' he asked, suddenly and absurdly self- conscious; the man had a knack for looking like he was staring straight into his soul. Mr White shook his head, emptying his tumbler. 'Nothing, don't worry….' 'No, you can't go fuckin' staring at me and not say why-what, have I got something on my face?' Freddy asked, patting down his cheeks to make sure he didn't have any of his dinner on them. Mr White chuckled, sitting up straighter. 'No, you aint got nothing on your face- you just reminded me of someone, that's all…want another drink?' he asked, nodding at the half-finished bottle in Freddy's hand. 'Uh, yeah, go on then- you can tell me after!' he said, nodding a thanks as Mr White ambled off to the bar. He put his bottle down and sunk his head into his hand, resting on his elbow. He and Mr White had been getting personal lately- talking generally about things they liked, what they didn't, some hazy aspects of their past; Freddy knew he wasn't to talk too much, and it wasn't like Mr White was an open book. He didn't really want to know who Mr White thought he resembled; he didn't want to get compared to a crook, or some bastard who shot up a street or something; he'd just rather not know. A couple of minutes later and the man was back, this time with a pint for Freddy and a double shot for himself. Freddy widened his eyes, before chuckling. 'You alright?' he muttered, draining the rest of his previous bottle. 'Course I am, why the fuck wouldn't I be?' 'Hey don't be like that, it was only a question.' Freddy shot back, quick as lightening. Mr White softened, chuckling lightly. 'Sorry Kid, it's just been a rough week.' 'Oh yeah? Some bitch giving you hassle? Want me to sort her out, good and proper like?' Freddy grinned, raising his eyebrows. 'No, nothing like that….' Mr White now looked like the morose person that Freddy was thinking about; he circled his tumbler in his hands, watching the ice clink into the glass. Freddy frowned, unusual sympathy tinging- he knew he shouldn't care, shouldn't even allow himself a single caring emotion for this guy, but…something about the way he stared into his glass made Freddy feel a jolt of sympathy. Something was bothering him, and the part of him that wasn't a cop wanted to know what. He leaned forward slowly, bottle in hand. 'You gonna tell me or do I have to beat it out of you?' he muttered. 'Beat me? Boy- if you ever hit me, make sure you do it so hard I never wake up, cos if I do get up, you are never gonna walk again!' Mr White growled, before smirking as Freddy chuckled and averted his gaze. 'Alright, so I won't beat you- what's eating you then?' he asked, sitting back. The older man sighed, taking another gulp of liquid before clearing his throat. 'It happened a while ago, don't know why I'm even still thinking about it…' he muttered. 'It must be pretty bad, though?' Mr White sighed and shook his head a little. 'It's your fault….' He said, and he seemed deadly serious. Freddy nearly choked on his beer. 'Wait, what?' he stammered, coughing. 'It is- you come in, a young guy, his whole life ahead of him, and it just reminds me of my own boy….' The older man's voice trailed off, and he took another swig. Freddy frowned inwardly; he had only had time to do a quick skim of Larry's notes, and hadn't even looked at his family history. 'Oh.' Was all he could say, and he sat back further, not knowing what else to say. Mr White nodded, clearing his throat. He looked behind Freddy and into the bar beyond, but Freddy noticed his eyes kept flicking back to his own. 'You wanna talk about it?' he asked, voice low. 'No I don't want to fucking talk about it!' Mr White snapped, but he softened as he caught Freddy's expression. 'I'm sorry, kid- I guess it's still raw…..' 'Did he die?' Freddy asked, earnestly wanting to know more. Mr White sighed, and nodded his head with a tiny jerk. 'Ah….I'm sorry man.' Was all Freddy could say. 'I don't need any fucking sympathy or any fucking pity- don't you go sorrying me anymore!' Mr White growled, eyes threatening. 'Chill man, I was just saying….' 'Well don't!' I don't usually talk about anything to do it my family, but with you….I don't know, I feel I can trust you.' He muttered, shaking his head. 'God knows why….' He finished. 'Thanks, I guess.' Freddy muttered, conflicting emotions now fluttering in his head- on one hand he wanted to be there for Larry as a friend, almost like the confidant the man thought he was, but on the other he wanted to gather as much info on this bastard as he could; this sort of info could be juicy material for interrogations. 'You don't have to tell me man; I'll just pretend you didn't say anything….' He said, taking another swig of his pint. Mr White sighed, wiping a hand down his face. 'He was about your age, maybe younger, since you haven't told me how old you are- he was on his way to a great career, was making good money, had a beautiful girlfriend.' He started, looking Freddy full in the face, as if wanting him to say something. Freddy nodded, but didn't know what to say to the guy; he didn't want to upset him even more, as he didn't know what Larry would be like with high emotions. 'We went to the store one day; I was working a job out of town- he didn't know what I do, see. We were just looking round when suddenly someone pulls a gun on us.' Mr White cleared his throat, taking another gulp and draining his glass- instead of walking to the bar he just waved his empty glass at the direction of the barman, and sat back, sighing. 'I'm sorry man, sounds rough….' Freddy muttered. 'He died in my arms, bleeding and screaming. Sometimes, when I'm lying in bed, I can still hear it….' Mr White chuckled wetly. 'Look at me, blubbing like a fucking baby.' He growled, wiping the corners of his eyes. 'It's alright, man. I won't tell no-one…' Freddy muttered, giving him a smile. 'I don't give a shit what you do; don't make no difference to me.' Mr White said, not looking up as his refilled glass was placed in front of him by the barman. 'You remind me of him- the way he could make any choice, the whole world in front of him…..why are you doing this, kid?' he asked, head snapping up. The question took Freddy completely by surprise; he floundered for a second before regaining some composure. 'For the money, you know? I can't get a job, got no family….this is the only way, you know?' he replied, the lies coming easy to him. 'I know kid, I really do- but there are other ways.' 'Like what? No one pays as well as Joe- I'm literally this far from going under.' Freddy motioned a centimetre with his fingers. Mr White nodded and cleared his throat. 'Joe is a good man; he's pretty good when it comes to money.' 'I know…..it's not like I grew up thinking that one day I'm going to be a thief and a criminal, was it?' Freddy continued, chuckling darkly. 'I don't think any of us grew up thinking that.' Mr White agreed, before sipping from his glass. They sat back, each contemplating the conversation. 'Don't worry kid, I'll make sure nothing happens to you; it's almost like I'm getting a second chance with you, to make sure you're safe….something I couldn't do with my boy.' Suddenly Freddy felt a surge of warmth for the guy, despite knowing he shouldn't. This man was dangerous, had killed and maimed people, had stolen thousands of pounds worth of gear….but here he was, bearing his soul like he was on fucking Oprah. Almost as surprisingly, he also felt a little gratefulness that Larry was willing to look after him, to make sure nothing happened to him…..in a weird way he trusted the guy, but knew never to rely on him. 'Thanks man….' He muttered, draining his glass and sighing. He looked at his watch, before looking up at the older man. 'Time to go?' he asked, before standing up and stretching. 'You go; I'll stay here for a while.' Mr White muttered, again waving his glass. 'Gonna get plastered?' Freddy chuckled, patting Larry on the shoulder as he passed. 'And what if I am?' the older man snapped. 'Nothing, man, nothing- see you in the morning?' Freddy called back as he moved to the door. 'See you tomorrow kid, bright and early for the meeting.' Mr White muttered, already nursing his next whisky. Freddy called back and left the bar, the cold air hitting his face. He felt his head cloud a little with the alcohol; he started to walk back to his apartment, the dark and peace a welcome contrast from the bar. Lawrence Dimmick confused him. He guessed it was because he was trying to get so close to the man in order to infiltrate the group and get to Joe. But the way the guy was so willing to look after him….he didn't know what to think about that. It was nice to know someone was looking out for him, had his back when his cop buddies couldn't- but the guy was a killer, a hardened, brutal killer… Freddy sighed as his key finally got into the lock; he stumbled into his apartment, flinging his keys onto the table. He managed to get to his bed without incident, and he sat on the covers, confused. Shaking his head, he decided to just let things progress, to just ride out the case and see what happened. Nothing bad was going to happen to him anyway, so Larry would have no need to fulfil his promises to protect him. It was all going to go to the plan, and he was pretty sure it would all be over soon. Now it was only a waiting game….. I hope you enjoyed this! Please review! Thanks for reading! Xx ","Summary":" Hello! Well, this is my first ever Reservoir Dogs fic- I hope you like it!

Do what? Pizza good?\" There's a snort from Vic. \"I'm in a pizza mood,\" Eddie says, a little nervously, because Vic has just been getting weirder and weirder since they left his dad's office. \"Sure.\" / They'd just put up a Papa John's a few blocks away from Joe's office, so recently the paint in the bathrooms is still wet. Eddie tries to swagger into the building but it's harder to cop a swagger with Vic around so he settles for a bustling walk, his brick of a cell phone swinging jauntily in his jacket pocket. Vic sidles inside, rolling an unlit cigarette in his fingers. Eddie orders a large pie, extra cheese, and the two of them take a seat in a small booth. \"So, how hard should I be trying to avoid prison?\" Vic gestures with the cigarette. \"It's not so bad, once you get in there and... assimilate .\" \"Is that code for 'learn to like big black dick'?\" \"You mean you don't already?

It hits Eddie in the nose and he clears his throat as Vic drags him into a stall. They're alone. It's early on a weekday, not prime time for pizza. Eddie's breath starts coming a little fast. The lock clicks. Vic's tongue is in his mouth. Eddie pushes him back. \"Hey!\" \"What,\" Vic whispers. \"What?\" His hand is on Eddie's dick, which is already hard, giving him away. Shit. But not like this. Not with Vic shark-eyed and smelling the way he did, like industrial-strength detergent and metal. Maybe before, when there had been something fun about it; sneaking away from Joe to go hump with reckless abandon somewhere. This was weird. \"You crazy bastard,\" Eddie hisses. \"Public bathroom.\" \"In this dump?\" Vic presses his nail down on Eddie's lower lip, quieting him, and backs him further against the wall. \"No one gives a shit.\" He laughs. \"I think you're scared of me.\" \"You dumbass.\" \"Eddie, you were always my little bitch, ain't nothing gonna change now.\" Something about that was reassuring. But something about it also rang false. Eddie let Vic kiss him, in an obscene, possessive way. Vic moved to his neck and he let out a sharp gasp without thinking about it. Vic laughed. \"Eddie the bitch,\" he whispers against his throat. His teeth graze Eddie's skin. \"I'm the best thing you've seen in years,\" he snaps back. \"You know, you might just fucking be right about that,\" Vic says, leaning back, sliding his hand into Eddie's pants. \"You might just be right for once.\" Eddie tips his head back. It hits the wall of the stall. His eyes are squeezed shut. It's kind of humiliating, but he's decided not to care, because if he's being honest, few things feel better than Vic's hand on his dick.

I made it as a bit of a parody of all those Draco In Leather Pants stories with all the Mary Sues - I had all those terrible fics in mind when I wrote it. Ginny sighed, slowly walking over to a table in the small diner. \"Just a couple more paychecks and I'm out of here.\" She murmured to herself. \"All set, hot stuff?\" She smirked at the solitary man. He just nodded in acknowedgement. He had brown hair and maybe the most beautiful blue eyes Ginny had ever seen. He was wearing a pretty snazzy suit too. She counted the money to see if everything was in order. To her, it wasn't. \"What, no tip?\" \"I don't tip.\" He replied, not even looking her in the eye. \"What the hell's that about? Look at your suit! You've got money to spare!\" He looked at her finally, an irritated expression on his face. \"Listen, toots, you know what you can do? Cry me a river, build yourself a bridge, and get the fuck over it.\" \"And you can take your stuck-up attitude and shove it right up your-\" He lunged forward and pulled her down by her shirt collar. \"I just got out of jail, sweetheart,\" he whispered into her ear, \"you think it would make any difference if I killed you and went back in?\" \"You wouldn't.\" She whimpered. \"Not in front of everyone.\" It was a weak moment for her, but now that she was dealing with murderers... \"Wouldn't I?\" \"Okay. I give. No tip. Uncle.\" He let her go. She stared at him, a vacant look in her eyes. Before he could suggest to himself that she had died of shock, she spoke. \"You're absolutely, bat-shit insane.\" \"Don't push it.\" He snapped. \"You are.\" She nodded, laughing in a display of her own insanity. \"You know what you are? You're a psycho, you're a bastard, and you're devilishly handsome.\" \"I warned you to...wait, what was that last part?\" Ginny realized suddenly what she could use to her advantage: Plan B to get her tip. She wasn't bad-looking, and he definitely wasn't, so a little flirtation couldn't hurt. She'd seen most of her coworkers do it before. 'Do you take offense to that, tiger?\" \"If you're trying to get a tip again, it's not working.\" She gulped, desperately trying to think of a way to cover. \"No, just...trying to fulfill an empty space in my life.\" She leaned in and began whispering. \"A girl gets hungry sometimes. And for something other than food.\" He smirked a little at this, so Ginny handed him the address of the apartment building where she lived. \"Tonight.\" She ordered. \"10:00. I'll be waiting.\" \"What makes you think I'm going to come?\" He retorted. \"I don't. But the offer's on the table.\" With that, she walked away, a little ashamed and a little nervous, but a lot amused. When she was behind the counter again, making coffee for two middle-aged men in football jerseys, she watched him walk out. 10:00 tonight, Ginny, she reminded herself. Go get your will ready. In spite of the danger she felt she was getting into, she had to laugh. Ginny didn't know how to feel. It was a little past 10:00, the man had come after all, and they were currently making out on her couch. What would my father say if he found out that I took an ex-convict home? But truthfully, she didn't really care. She was snapped back into reality when he started unbuttoning her ugly white work shirt. Her first instinct was to push his hand away, which halted everything. \"I thought the reason that you invited me over was...\" He trailed off, not wanting to scare her away. Ginny came to a conclusion: He's pretty attractive, he just may kill me, and I haven't had sex in forever. \"No, we are, I was just a bit...stunned.\" He smiled wickedly. \"Where's the bedroom?\" When she pointed to the door to the right, he promptly grasped her, lifted her, and carried her into the room. \"What the fuck are you doing?!\" She screamed, her emotions constantly changing from scared to amused to aroused. \"Just making sure you can't get away.\" He purred in her ear. The next morning, Ginny had already dressed when the man finally woke up. She was ashamed that she didn't even know his name yet. \"Leaving so soon?\" He asked. \"I get it.\" She replied. \"One night stand. We fuck the hell out of each other, then forget all about it.\" \"I don't think I'm ready to let you go just yet.\" She was shocked by this. To see if he was being honest, she made him a proposition. \"All right, then. Take me out to dinner tonight, somewhere decent, and you're going to tip.\" He rolled his eyes. \"All I said was I want to see you again. I didn't drop down on one knee and fucking propose to you. I should've known you were one of those obsessive chicks who change everything they don't like as if they had all the power in the world. Well, you don't.\" \"Well, we'll just see who drives who crazy first.\" She smirked. \"You picking me up at 10:00 or what?\" \"Fine.\" He replied. \"I am not an unforgiving person.

Fabrice Beaupre, nyaris tidak bisa menggerakan seluruh tubuhnya karena sempat tertimpa runtuhan bangunan dari kayu. Ia menyingkirkan puing-puing bangunan tersebut dan berharap musuh tak menemukannya. Tiba-tiba sebuah dentuman keras menyingkirkan Kayu yang menimpa Fabrice, serta melemparnya keluar dari bangunan tersebut. Fabrice terseungkur lemas dan nyaris tak berdaya, beruntung ia masih menggerakkan kedua kakinya walaupun ia menyadari bahwa kemungkinan melarikan diri dari kejaran dengan luka separah itu mustahil. Dia segera berlari menuju sungai Rouen, dan menceburkan dirinya. Dia berenang menuju kawasan Villers-Bocage, namun setelah mencapai permukaan dia tak menyadari bahwa dirinya masih berada di Rouen. Tak berselang lama Fabrice hanya menghela nafas setelah berenang menyusuri kawasan tersebut. Tetapi saat akan bangkit, sesuatu telah membentur punggunya sehingga Fabrice tersungkur dan pingsan. Kelopak matanya mulai terbuka perlahan-lahan, terlihat seseorang menatapnya dengan pandangan yang kabur. \"Dimana kamu menyembunyikan Lembaran itu?\" Tanyanya. Saat pandangannya mulai pulih, dia sudah menduga bahwa hal tersebut sudah terjadi. \"(Meninju Fabrice) DIMANA KAMU MENYEMBUNYIKANNYA?\" Bentak orang tersebut sembari menyiksanya berkali-kali. \"Kau tak akan mendapat lembaran itu... Membunuhku pun percuma.\" Saking kesalnya, dia menghujamkan pisau belatinya ke kaki kirinya dan melubanginya sehingga membuat rasa sakitnya semakin menjadi-jadi, sembari mengatakan hal yang sama saat Fabrice terbangun. Namun usahanya sia-sia, dan membuatnya naik pitam. Saat akan menghujamkan pisaunya kearah kepala Fabrice... JGLAAAARRR! Orang tersebut terpental jauh dari hadapannya. Terlihat sesorang membawa Drilling Double-Barreled Shotgun mendekatinya dan melepaskan tali yang mengikat seluruh tubuh dan tangannya. \"Hei, seperti biasa... kau datang terlambat, Emil.\" Ujar Fabrice sambil menahan rasa sakitnya. \"Pahlawan itu selalu datang kesiangan...\" Ujarnya. \"Brengsek, aku tak bisa menggerakkan kakiku kembali...\" \"Kali ini aku akan membopongmu menuju tempat yang aman. Kami sudah mensterilkan tempat ini, berharaplah agar kamu dapat bertempur kembali seperti di Bastille kemarin.\" \"Kau mengharapkanku untuk melakukannya kembali?\" \"Jangan banyak bicara, kita akan kembali ke markas kita.\" Fabrice, Emil, dan temannya meninggalkan tempat tersebut dengan truk yang sudah dibajak dari musuh dan melucuti senjata-senjata musuh itu. Pertempuran jalanan semakin memanas, dan tentunya tak seimbang. Dalam pertempuran tersebut, Emil tertembak ketika memacu truknya dengan kecepatan tinggi. Dengan terpaksa Fabrice menggantikan Emil untuk mempercepat laju Truknya. Sementara teman-temanya menembaki musuh dari belakang, Fabrice harus melakukan Drive-By untuk melawan musuh yang mencoba menembaknya. Namun saat akan melewati musuh, Fabrice harus menghentikan kecepatan Truk tersebut karena akan berhadapan langsung dengan dinding pembatas jalan. Namun ia tak bisa menjangkau Rem depan karena kaki kirinya masih Terluka cukup parah ketika Interogasi tersebut. Akhirnya Fabrice memilih menggunakan Rem Tangan. Mereka langsung terdorong cukup kuat ke depan. Salah satu temannya, DeRoche memaki Fabrice atas tindakannya tersebut. \"APA YANG KAMU LAKUKAN INI AKAN MEMBUNUH KITA SEMUA! Biarkan aku saja yang mengendarainya!\" \"Kau tak mengerti! Jika aku tetap ngotot untuk menginjak remnya maka pendarahan di kaki kiriku akan menjadi!\" \"Jangan banyak bicara! Kali ini Biarkan aku yang mengendarai Truk ini!\" DeRoche segera bergegas menuju kursi supir, sayang sebelum menyetuh kursi supir dia tertembak terlebih dahulu. \"DeRoche! Bertahanlah!\" \"FABRICE! CEPAT KEMUDIKAN TRUK INI!\" Kata terakhir dari DeRoche. \"Tidak, aku akan membawamu juga...\" \"Jangan Bodoh, kau akan mati juga nantinya!\" Fabrice hanya menuruti permintaan terakhirnya. Melanjutkan kembali perjalanannya menuju markas Resistancee, Fabrice memacu kecepatan truknya lebih cepat. Teman-temannya hanya bisa bertahan memegang tiang truk supaya tak terjatuh ketika Truk tersebut ngebut. Namun Fabrice menghadapi masalah; Rem tangan truk tersebut blong, sementara Kakinya masih belum pulih sepenuhnya. Pilihan Fabrice hanya satu: Menerobos pagar jalan dan menceburkannya ke sungai. Setelah menceburkan Truknya ke sungai, Fabrice membopong Emil dari dalam truk. Namun ia tak bisa berenang lebih lama lagi karena kakinya yang masih belum pulih sepenuhnya. Kali ini ia harus sadar bahwa ini adalah akhir dari segalanya... Bab I. Linear 7 PM, Rumah Sakit Beaumont. Aku terbangun dari ranjang tidurku, dan hari itu masih malam sekali. Mungkin tak ada gunanya jika saya terus berbaring di kamar ini. Sial, rasa sakit pada kaki ku mulai kambuh. Aku harus segera mencari Emil, dan teman-temanku. Aku berharap agar mereka selamat, dan aku mungkin saja tak bisa memaafkan diriku jika sesuatu terjadi pada mereka. Aku mencoba untuk bertanya kepada beberapa perawat, namun mereka tak mengerti apa yang kutanyakan. Saat saya bertemu dengan salah satu dokter terkemuka di Rumah Sakit ini... \"Dokter, bagaimana dengan keadaan Emil dan yang lainnya?\" Dokter tersebut menyuruhku untuk menemuinya di UGD, mungkin lebih baik jika saya mempercepat langkahku; tapi semua sudah terlambat. Saya hanya bisa melihatnya telah tertutup kain putih, saya hanya bisa tertunduk lemas. Nasehat dari sang perawat pun saya tak gubris. \"Sabar, temanmu pasti akan merasa tenang jika kau tak...\" Aku langsung pergi. Ketika menuju pintu keluar, namun... Saya dihadang oleh 2 penjaga ketika menuju pintu keluar. \"Hei, kau tak boleh kemana-mana, pergilah ke kamarmu sekarang!\" Bentak salah satu penjaga itu. Aku tak meladeni perkataannya. Saat dia mencengkeram tanganku, refleks aku langsung membantingnya ke arah penjaga lainnya. Akhirnya aku dapat berlari menuju gerbang, tapi aku tak bisa berlari secepat mungkin atau pendarahan di kakiku mulai menjadi-jadi. Kupikir inilah saatnya untuk tetap tenang, dan fokus. Sesuatu menusukku dari leherku, dan membuatku mati rasa. Brengsek. Saya sudah menduga kalau saya bakal bangun di ruangan ini, tapi anehnya saya tak merasa seperti diawasi. Bagus, mungkin aku akan mencoba melarikan diri secepatnya. Saat aku melangkahkan kaki kiriku, tak terasa sakit sama sekali. Mungkin saya harus berterima kasih kepada siapapun yang menolongku, namun ini bukan saat yang tepat untuk melakukannya. Aura yang kurasakan benar-benar mencekam setelah keluar dari ruangan itu, seperti tak ada siapapun di lorong tersebut. Senyap, namun tak gelap. Melarikan diri dari rumah sakit adalah tujuanku. Namun, setengah perjalanan saya menuju pintu keluar, terlihat mayat penuh dengan luka tembak didepanku. Tidak jauh dari situ, beberapa mayat dengan kondisi yang sama juga terlihat di dalam ruangan dengan pintu yang sepertinya didobrak orang lain. Belum sampai disitu, ternyata banyak sekali mayat yang bergelimpangan di setiap tangga yang kulewati. Semakin cepat keluar dari sini, semakin baik. Namun, semua prediksiku salah... Sebuah APC(Armored Personnel Carrier) terlihat sedang melewati gerbang masuk Rumah Sakit Beaumont. Tak hanya itu, sesorang yang bersenjatakan lengkap pun terlihat dari kejauhan dengan jelas. Mungkin merekalah yang membuat kekacauan serta pembantaian di rumah sakit ini. Aku hanya membatin untuk sesaat, namun sepertinya saya telah menekan sesuatu dan membuat suara yang mengelegar. Kontan aku kaget seketika, karena secara tak sengaja saya telah menekan tombol pemicu senapan. Sepertinya aku membuat mereka berbalik arah! \"SIAPA ITU?\" \"Hei, tenang dulu. Apa yang terjadi? \"Saya mendengar tembakkan dari rumah sakit itu! Tidak salah lagi, suara itu pasti berada di sana!\" \"Mungkin salah satu dari kita benar-benar membersihkan tempat tersebut.\" \"Jadi seperti itu? Kupikir apa.\" Saat aku menoleh dari salah satu mobil, sepertinya mereka melanjutkan perjalananya keluar dari rumah sakit. Fiuh... Setelah bertarung melawan adrenalinku, mungkin ada baiknya kembali ke dalam ruangan untuk mencari barang-barang yang dapat berguna sebagai senjata. Dan salah satunya adalah FAMAS yang sedang kupegang. Setelah mencari benda yang akan kucari dan tak ada, lebih baik segera meninggalkan tempat ini sebelum mereka berbalik arah. Aku pun mengambil salah satu mobil yang terparkir tanpa ada cacat sedikitpun. Syukurlah saya sudah keluar dari tempat tersebut. Saat dalam perjalanan... Seseorang menodongku. \"Hei, kendarakan mobil ini dengan benar. Rasanya kau...\" Perkataan tersebut mulai berhenti, namun aku tak mau memalingkan kepalaku ataupun melihat dari kaca mobil. \"Fabrice, kau...\" Sepertinya aku mendengar suara yang tak asing lagi kudengar, dan sejenak aku menghentikan mobilku. Ketika melihat siapa di belakangku... \"EMIL? Kau masih hidup?\" \"Fabrice? Aku kira kau mati tenggelam. Sekarang dimana kita?\" \"Yang penting kita sudah jauh dari RS. Beaumont. Kita masih aman saat ini. Sebaiknya kita kembali ke markas kita.\" \"Tidak, mereka telah menyerbunya. Tidak ada yang tersisa, berikut seluruh senjata yang kita rampas telah dilucuti kembali oleh mereka.\" \"APA? KENAPA BISA BEGITU?\" \"Balmer memberitahukan markas kita kepada mereka ketika dia ditangkap pasukan negara. Aku bersembunyi di salah satu parit yang sengaja saya bangun dan tersambung dari kamar mandi. Tidak ada yang tersisa disana dan tak ada senjata yang dapat diambil kembali.\" \"Mungkin kita harus menghabisinya.\" \"Balmer sudah mati, walaupun dia membeberkannya.\" Tak ada perjalanan yang pendek untuk kami tempuh, markasku sudah saya anggap sebagai rumah sendiri. Waktunya menunggu kesempatan yang tak pernah kudapatkan selama 10 tahun lalu. Kalau bukan presiden kami, mungkin dia sudah kuhabisi terlebih dahulu. Tentunya dia berbeda dari yang lain; jika tampuk kepemimpinannya sudah diruntuhkan, pasukan loyalisnya akan menyabotase daerah vital bagi Perancis sendiri. Pengecut. Brengsek. Akan kuhabisi dia. 16 PM, Villers-Bocage, menuju Cauquigny. Perjalanan dari kota tersebut menghabiskan beberapa liter bensin. Peugeot 506 yang konon memang boros bensin tetap kami tunggangi, untuk sampai ke Cauqguiny sejauh 2 km. Sial, kali ini kami benar-benar kehabisan bahan bakar dan tak ada depot bensin di sekitar sini. Lagipula, kalaupun seandainya ada kami tak memiliki uang untuk membelinya. Dan seperti yang telah saya tebak, pasukan dengan seragam yang sama berada di salah satu bangunan yang hancur. Aku dan Emil langsung menyelinap dibawah VBC-90 milik mereka. Sebelum kami mengendarai atau lebih tepatnya mengambil alih VBC, sempat terdengar beberapa percakapan yang cukup rahasia. Ternyata mereka sudah mengajak para Gendarmerie untuk melenyapkan para militan di Cauquigny. Tidak hanya itu, selama ini mereka menyewa PMC untuk memburu para pemberontak pemerintahan. \"Mereka menyewa PMC dan Gendarmes untuk membunuh orang tak bersenjata agar menghindari pemberontakan?\" \"Lebih tepatnya membunuh demi diktator.\" \"Lebih baik kita percepat menuju Cauquigny, atau mereka akan membersihkan populasi kota itu!\" Kami langsung mempercepat langkah kami dengan menjalankannya. Pasukan tersebut mengetahui kalau satu-satunya APCnya dibajak, langsung memulai serangan dengan senapan ringan mereka. Emil yang bertugas sebagai Penembak/Gunner berhasil menghabisi mereka, dan kami meninggalkan Villers-Bocage. Saat akan meninggalkan kota itu... \"Berhenti!\" Kami langsung menghentikan kendaraan ini. \"Ada apa? Kau pikir apa yang kau lakukan ini?\" Emil langsung keluar dengan seragam musuh yang ia kenakan. \"Bagaimana keadaan disana?\" \"Seperti biasa, merayakan kemenangan kita di sana. Sayang kau tak ikut dengan kami.\" \"Sebaiknya rayakan kemenangan kita saat berhasil menghancurkan mereka di Cauquigny!\" \"Sudahlah, saya sendiri mendapat perintah untuk pergi ke kawasan itu. Suruh anggotamu untuk membuka jalan untuk kami!\" \"(Sambil meminum minuman kaleng)Oke.\" Akhirnya mereka membuka barikadenya untuk kami. Syukurlah kami tak merasa di curigai. Namun ada pesan radio yang tiba-tiba terdengar. \"Kami menemukan penyerangan besar-besaran di koordinat 2-5-3. 14 anggota kita mati, dan VBC-90 kita hilang. Kemungkinan besar militan mencurinya dan menghabisi mereka. Kode VBC-90 itu adalah 'La Fayette'. Ada kemungkinan mereka berada di luar kawasan Villers-Bocage. Jika menemukan mereka, habisi mereka ditempat.\" Seusai laporan dari transmisi tersebut, serangan kembali menghantam APC kami dengan dahsyat dan tak terduga. Serangan bertubi-tubi tersebut membuat kami harus memacu kecepatan APC untuk menghindari serangan berikutnya yang dapat menghancurkan APC ini. Parahnya, karena serangan tadi peforma kecepatan menurun. Kami terpaksa menggunakan 90mm Main Gun untuk melakukan serangan balasan, tapi banyaknya jumlah APC musuh membuat Emil berpikir ulang untuk melakukannya. APC kami semakin tidak kuat untuk menahan gempuran musuh, hanya perlu kemungkinan 2-3 serangan untuk meledakkan APC ini. Tanpa ragu, kami langsung pergi menghindari APC yang siap meledak. Saya pikir mereka sudah selesai, namun tidak. Kali ini beberapa diantara mereka mulai berjalan menuju APC itu. Kami meragukan kemungkinan untuk selamat, tapi dengan seluruh tekad yang membara saya membuka serangan kepada mereka dengan FAMAS, sementara Emil masih setia dengan Drillingnya itu. Namun jumlah mereka terlalu banyak, dan amunisi yang kami miliki hanya 4 Magasen berisikan 30 butir perluru berkaliber 5.56 STANAG, dan 40 butir peluru 12-Gauge. Pertempuran semakin sengit ketika kami harus berhadapan dengan monster baja yang siap melahap kami! \"Emil, masuk ke rumah itu! Biarkan aku yang menahan mereka disini.\" \"Fabrice, jangan mengorbankan dirimu! Kau pikir dengan bertempur sendirian kau akan menang?\" \"...\" \"FABRICE!\" 23 PM, Versailles Tower Aku tak bisa berbuat banyak, seluruh badanku terikat. Pasukan bertubuh tinggi mulai mengacungkan Felin mereka ke arahku, lebih tepatnya mereka mengincar kepalaku. Kelihatannya bukan aku sendiri saja yang akan bernasib sama, Emil ikut tertangkap saat penyerbuan berlangsung. Belum sempat melihatnya, dia telah mecicipi puluhan peluru mereka. Percuma saya berteriak, dan memaki. Lagipula saya juga akan merasakan nasib yang sama juga. Dan... \"Hanya mimpi, syukurlah. Nggghh... tapi kenapa dengan tubuhku?\" Persis dalam mimpi, tubuhku terikat di tiang. Kupastikan agar Emil tak senasib dengan ku. Namun semuanya terjadi, layaknya Deja Vu. Ini bukanlah akhir dari segalannya. \"Ada pesan terahkir sebelum memulai?\" Tanya Komandan eksekutor sebelum memulainya. \"Aku ingin berbicara kepadanya.\" Kuharap dia akan menerima ini... \"KURANG AJAR! SUDAH KUKATAKAN UNTUK TIDAK MENGIKUTIKU, BRENGSEK!\" \"Mh, ingatlah bahwa mereka dan negara ini akan menuliskan kisah dua orang yang meumbangkan kepemimpinannya.\" \"Sok jago sekali kau... Rezimnya tak akan pernah ditumbangkan begitu saja...\" Namun kali ini bukan para eksekutor itu yang siap menghabisi kami. \"Fabrice Beaupre, lancang sekali kamu dengan mudahnya mengacaukan keamanan negara. Kali ini, kau dan temanmu akan merasakan keabadian neraka disana...\" Dia menunjukan kelicikannya lewat senyuman iblisnya itu... \"Berharaplah, mimpimu hanya sebatas mimpi. Biarpun kami mati, kebangkitan mereka akan dapat menumbangkan rezim yang telah kau bangun.\" \"Mudah untuk mengungkapkan seluruh isi hatimu, tapi kau tak punya waktu lagi. Komandan, berikan senjatamu itu! Biarkan aku yang menjadi eksekutor bagi mereka.\" ","Summary":" Terbangun dalam keadaan sekarat, itulah yang dialami seorang French Resistancee.

If I had created this movie (or owned any of this movie) I would be rich and not bothering to write poorly written fanfics. Notes: This story is unbeta'd, and therefore all the mistakes are clearly mine. Most likely there are quite a few, so if anyone wants to point them out politely I will be happy to listen and change them. Thanks! Oh yes, and please review , it makes me happy. There they are in a shitty motel room, in a fucking crappy bed that squeaks every time someone so much as breathes, but Freddy has never been so happy. He hadn't gone out of his way to seek love; instead it had hidden around a corner lying in wait before surprising him like a criminal. For once he's happy to be knocked out and surprised. He knows he's breaking too many police codes to even count, but at this instant he doesn't care. Love was presented at his doorstep wrapped in a pretty big red bow, and he couldn't help but open it, even if it turned out to be a bomb later. Freddy turns over so that he can face his sleeping lover the bed creaks in protest but he ignores it. He doesn't know why but at this very point in time everything feels peaceful and happy. Time seems to be completely still in this room; even the goddamn birds haven't made a peep yet. At this precise moment Freddy is no longer a cop, and Larry is no longer a thief. They are just themselves and it makes Freddy want to weep with joy. He doesn't cry though, instead he smiles softly at Larry's sleeping face. The features have softened making him look like an unthreatening and considerably younger polar bear. Freddy runs his fingers down the bridge of Larry's nose letting it rest gently against the tip. Larry grabs his wrist before he opens his eyes and kisses Freddy's palm. They're both silent for the longest time just staring into each others eyes captivated. Larry breaks the silence when he lets go of Freddy's wrist reaching over and placing an open mouthed kiss on Freddy's lips before saying, \"You're up early.\" \"It's not early, we slept in,\" Freddy chuckles, gently running his hand down Larry's arm. Larry stretches, raising his hands above his head and sits up. Freddy follows closely behind and sighs when he places his head against Larry's shoulder revelling in the amount of comfort it gives him. Freddy knows that it's weird to feels so safe during moments like these, where at any moment he could be revealed as the fraud he truly is. There is a little voice in the back of his head that whispers when he tries to sleep that he's a fucking liar and doesn't deserve the happiness that has been presented to him. The voice causes his chest squeeze and makes it difficult to breathe as he tries to fight away the sadness which suddenly engulfs him. He pushes the thought away quickly ignoring the whispers. Then he suddenly the urge to tell the truth gets too much. Freddy knows what will happen when he finally reveals that he's a fake, a fraud. He's pictured his death a thousand different ways, picturing it a few more times doesn't change anything. The death that Freddy's always enjoyed (or at least as much as a person can when picturing their own fucking death) is thought of Larry being the one to kill him, maybe even shooting him with tears in his eyes. Freddy almost thinks that he doesn't even deserve a death like that. He opens his mouth and closes it until he has the nerve to say it the; three little words that have nothing to do with I love you (although Freddy wants to say those magic words too). \"I…\" I'm a cop , he tries to say but stops . \"It's okay, you don't have to say it,\" Larry says burying his head in Freddy's hair, inhaling the sweet scent. \"I love you too.\" Freddy stays silent as he feels hands run through his hair. How could he tell Larry the truth about everything? There was a time when Freddy thought that this was a fucking game. A stupid game of cops and robbers that he used to play as a child, now all he thinks about is the ultimate act of betrayal that had occurred. Freddy was in love Larry and Larry loved him—no, not the real him of course. Larry loved the person who went by the alias Mr. Orange and did petty crimes, not the cop who took down criminals no matter what the cost. Freddy hoped that one day Larry would love him because he took down criminals, that wouldn't be anytime soon though. In the near future he hoped that he would be able to convince Larry to back out of the operation. Maybe he'd be able to work up his courage soon, not today, but soon. Time flies by fast though; faster then one would expect. It's now here, it's the day of the operation (which hadn't gone as smoothly as everyone had hoped, himself included) and he hadn't mentioned anything to Larry. And above all here he is, blood gushing onto the cold concrete floor with a fucking bullet in his chest. He knows he was going to die, and it frightens him. He's lost too much blood and everything is passing by him at blurry random speeds. The next thing he understands is someone's saying that he's working with LAPD, and he opens his mouth pushing out words that he isn't even sure if they make a complete sentence let alone make any sense. Then Larry is defending and protecting him, pointing a gun at the people he knew and trusted. The next thing he can hear is there are bullet sounds and then silence. The silence stretches out for far too long, threatening to bury him. He knows that Larry was shot, but was he shot dead? He doesn't have a fucking clue. Finally some form of movement happens and it's not Mr. Pink trying to escape with the money, that slimy bastard. It's Larry and he's slowly edging his way towards Freddy. Freddy reaches out to help, even though he knows that he has no strength to even begin to. He can't tell how bad Larry's been shot but he vaguely wonders if they're both dying. It's morbid, but he's glad that Larry's here in his last moments. They both reach out for each other just to feel each others skin, to know they're both still breathing. His head is in Larry's lap, he wants to turn around and face Larry but he's too weak and can't even begin to try. Larry's hands are rubbing the sides of his face and he can't help but awkwardly hug Larry as best as he can in the position he's in. He starts to feel safe almost like he's back with Larry in the fucking god-awful motel. He can hear himself begin to mumble. He has no clue what he's fucking saying, but he just feels the need to fill up the silence with more than his painful gasps. Freddy feel the darkness ascend over him, and at this moment he's not sure if it's literally or figuratively. Everything's so fucked up now; this wasn't how things were supposed to go down. Nobody meant for this to happen; of course nobody means for these things to happen. But they do and they fucking ruin everything that he had wanted. He's going to die, he knows it, but before he lets the darkness take him he has to tell Larry the truth. Freddy has to bestow Larry with the one thing he wasn't sure he could ever tell him. He has to tell him and it has to be now. \"I'm a cop,\" he whispers after a moment an apology soon following out of his blubbering lips. Larry was going to find out eventually, and he'd rather Larry hear it from him then some other beaten down cop. The sound that leaves Larry's mouth is heartbreaking. Pain chilling and soul numbing, it is the sound of a heart breaking. Larry has tears in his eyes, but he still clings onto Freddy as if can't live without him. At this very moment he knows Larry still loves him no matter what he's done. Freddy relishes in that, but this was the ultimate act of betrayal and he knows what has to be done. \"I know,\" Larry replies in between his pain filled cries, his voice ragged with sadness. Larry moves the gun, and Freddy sees a flash of silver before the gun is placed against him. The steel of the gun is almost warm against Freddy's clammy chin, and he welcomes it. For a moment he's scared, not of the gun and the bullet waiting to bury itself deep in his skull, but scared that Larry might not go through with it. When the cops arrive Freddy knows that it's a done deal—Larry will shoot him. Freddy's happy (at least as happy as a man who knows he's an inch from death), knew this would happen, Larry would have to shoot him, there was no if, ands, or buts. An act of betrayal was the ultimate sin. Freddy was not angry with Larry for that, ever since he had known death was his only option this was how he had always wanted to go.

No-one ever tended to live at this particular apartment building for very long. Six months at the latest, before they moved out again. Lindelle had lived there for about that long now. You know how a building has a certain feeling about it, when you first walk in? When she walked into her Grandma's house, she saw images in her head of laughing children, dancing through sprinklers on a summer's day, long grass waving in the breeze, fizzy pitchers of lemonade and thickly iced cupcakes eagerly snatched up by grubby little hands. Her mother's house made her think of coldness...wine stains and bottles full of pills. Sterile rooms, with faded, threadbare blankets. Flickering lights. An uncaring indifference that settled around the house like a bad smell. And her girlfriend's flat reminded her of warmth and safety. Of flowers pressed between thick scrapbook pages and burning incense, filling up every corner of the house. Of dandelion tea in cracked cups. Something kinda spicy and exotic, something that made her feel so calm and happy and relaxed. Now her apartment block... Her few friends and family completely abhorred it, but it was the only place she could afford. There was something so stifling and heavy in the air, when you entered that building. An intense feeling of the ceilings and walls closing in on you. Of something closing in on you. \"I don't like it here,\" her girlfriend Rosaria whimpered a little, interlacing her chubby, ring-encrusted fingers with hers when she first walked inside. \"It feels like...death or something...\" The other woman didn't say anything back. Rosaria had a particular way of pinpointing feelings that Lindelle could never quite articulate properly. The apartment...how could she explain? You walked in and you felt something heavy and sour settle deep inside your gut. Everything became constricted and tight, your skin coiling up and you felt something like...like... \"Paranoia,\" whispered Rosaria, as she slowly walked down the hallways, brushing her hands across the chipped paint walls. \"I feel like there were some...really, really scared people who used to live here.\" When she reached Lindelle's room, she moaned a little and pressed her temples hard, chestnut hair falling across her eyes. \"No...no I can't do it...\" she gasped, her voice pained and low. \"Get me out of here. Get me out of here now .\" Outside in the carpark, the curvier woman breathed out hard, resting her head between her knees as Lindelle soothingly rubbed her back. \"Baby, what's wrong?\" Rosaria wrinkled up her nose, staring out the window. \"That room...\" She massaged her eyes with the pads of her fingers. \"Sorry...\" she said lightly, as if not wanting to worry her. \"It's just...I felt such... grief in that room. And that... death feeling was so strong.\" \"Creepy shit,\" Lindelle replied, her voice a little shaky as she looked down at her feet. \"You think someone died in my room?\" Rosaria just silently laced their fingers together again and said nothing. That night, the dreams started up again. She'd had them when she first moved in, but the exhaustion of work had pushed them away. She dreamt of walking into her bathroom and seeing blood bubbling out from the plughole into the sink. Of her bathtub overflowing with scarlet blood, pouring down between the cracks in the tile. Of it sliding down the walls in thick, dark lines. She would wake up dripping with a cold sweat, terror gripping her intestines like a vice, tears wet at her cheeks. Trying to breathe, something coppery and metallic lining her throat like cement. One time when Rosaria had come over, (which was rare, because they were both much more comfortable at her place,) they'd been snuggled up on the couch, watching a movie, when suddenly... \"Ow! Ow!\" her face scrunched up all at once with pain and both her hands flew down to her stomach. \"Whatsa matter?\" Lindelle demanded immediately, sitting up. Rosaria doubled over, gasping for air. She pounded across the floor and slammed out of the apartment and into the corridor, the other woman close on her heels. Her girlfriend was pushing her forehead into the wall, taking big, gulping breaths. Finally, after a few seconds, she seemed to calm herself down. She curled up behind her, arms snaking around her waist. \"Doesn't matter,\" she sent Lindelle a pained little smile. \"I had this weird pain in my gut is all.\" \"C'min, I'll getcha a cup of tea...\" Rosaria rested her head on the other woman's skinny shoulder as they walked back inside the apartment. I'm sorry...I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... Her eyes flew open in the darkness of the bedroom, heart pounding, feeling something harsh and bitter filling up her mouth. There was a sharp ringing noise in her ears...ringing so loud, it almost hurt. The voice from her dream was high-pitched and ragged, like every breath, every word was torture. Even when she forgot other bits and pieces from the nightmares later on...that voice always stayed with her. It haunted her throughout her day, as she worked endlessly on the computer and the phone as a receptionist, pulling her hair back tight to take the evening shift at the restaurant later on. After a rushed meal and a shower, she'd collapse into bed and just sleep, utterly exhausted. And that voice would come floating back. I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry... Sometimes when she sat in the dark and stared up at the ceiling, trying to drift back to sleep, she wondered what had happened here, so many years ago. Who was he saying sorry to? Why? And why was there so much... blood ? \"Maybe,\" Rosaria said, because it seemed more like a fun murder-mystery at her place, compared to when they were at Lindelle's apartment and the dark, heavy feeling of death weighed down on them both like iron blocks. \"Maybe a husband stabbed his wife in the bathroom and that's why there's all that blood in your nightmares?\" \"Ken at work thinks a lady might've had a miscarriage in the bathroom...\" \"That's so sad. \" Lindelle rested her head on her shoulder and wrapped their arms together. \"I know...but I told him it sounded more like a guy in my dream. And anyway...don't you...don't you get a...get a sense of...uh...\" \"Masculinity?\" Rosaria added helpfully. \"Seriously, you go in there and it doesn't feel the slightest bit feminine...\" \"Yeah...I guess so,\" Lindelle agreed, frowning slightly. There she went again...pinpointing the exact thoughts swirling around her head, that she couldn't make into words. There was...well...sometimes she felt a hint of heightened testosterone around her apartment block. Down the halls, up the stairs. But her particular apartment was different somehow. There was...something more then just that. She couldn't really define it. It was a bit too intense. A bit too raw. A bit too tender. There was a thick, heavy passion in her apartment that she couldn't quite understand. \"It's like...it's like the first time you fall in love with someone. Y'know what I mean?\" Rosaria was trying to explain over breakfast, at one of their favorite little café's. It was hard to catch up, what with Lindelle's two jobs, but they tried to have at least a weekly visit. Lindelle sipped her coffee, which was strong enough to melt her teeth and thought about that idea. \"So you think a guy stabbed his lover in the bathroom?\" \"Maybe...but you know how kinda masculine that place feels, right? I was thinkin' maybe this guy stabbed his boy lover in the bathroom...\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah...and then he said sorry...\" \"...and died of a broken heart.\" \"Shit Rosie, that's bleak, \" Lindelle snorted over the rim of her cup, smirking. Her girlfriend slapped her on the arm, grinning back. \"Don't fuckin' laugh!\" she scolded her in mock outrage. \"It's a tragic love-story!\" Lindelle rolled her eyes. But then, a tad more seriously, she added; \"Next time I've got some free time, I'm looking my apartment up online.\" Rosario beamed from ear to ear. \"We can do it at my house! Slumber party!\" Lindelle bit back the disbelieving grin. \"What are you, ten?\" \"You'd be a pedophile then, y'know...\" \"Oh shut up.\" One of the other customers sent them a dirty look as they both burst into loud peals of uncontrollable laughter. Stabbing, Avenue 59 at Figueroa Street, Highland Park, Los Angeles... \"Nothing comes up.\" \"Try this...\" Man stabs lover, 5860 N. Figueroa Street, Highland Park, Los Angeles... \"Oh my god's there's nothing .\" \"Wait...\" The memory of the loud, echoing ringing from her dream suddenly came rushing back to her. Shooting, 5860 N. Figueroa Street, Highland Park, Los Angeles... ... ... Robbery at Karina's Wholesale Diamonds Leads To Bloodbath with 12 Dead, More Deaths Suspected. \"Holy fuck...\" \"Read the names...\" \"It doesn't have all the names, it just says about some guy called Joe Cabot, apparently he was a gangster boss or something...and they all shot each up at the warehouse...where the apartment is now.\" They slugged through old archives, and dove into article after article, trying desperately to find out more. \"One survivor out of the crooks...don't say what happened to him.\" Rosaria squinted her eyes at the old mugshot with distaste. \"He looks like a rat.\" Lindelle wrinkled up her nose. \"The real rat was the cop though...Freddy Newen...Newen...Newendyke.\" They both stared at the face on the screen and Lindelle felt something run up and down her spine, like cold icy water. \"How did he die?\" she asked, her voice quiet. It took a bit of a long time to drag up all the different types of death that had occurred that day, years and years before. There were no photos...just neatly typed descriptions. It sounded so...clinical to her. Her mind was still firmly fixed on that face with the piercing honeyed eyes (too young) and the floppy butterscotch hair. Please...please... \"What about the undercover dude? What happened to him?\" \"Some fucker got shot in the head...\" \"Rosie, what about the undercover cop?\" \"Delly, Jesus Christ, one of the cops got his ear fucking cut off...that's...that's disgusting...\" She heard herself snapping despite herself; \"Rosie, what about the Newendyke guy?\" \"I don't know, scroll down...\" ...three times. Three? Shot three times? The blood filled the bathtub. The blood oozed down from the ceilings. The blood overflowed in congealed clots from the drain-holes. It made a huge wet gluey pool on the tile floor, and it sloshes in scarlet stains up the walls. The heavy, throat-lining stench of it fills up her head and her throat and her mouth. Copper and metal, slick and slimy. \"Delly?\" She feels her soft hands slide into hers and squeeze them tight. Something hot and wet dribbles down her cheeks and she turns away to stare at her feet. Didn't she wake up in the middle of the night and feel that burning, bitter feeling of terror, as the ringing echoed in her ears...and then something else... Shame? I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. The next night she's home, she lies in her bed and stares up at the ceiling. She can't sleep. She knows there's a stain in these apartment walls that nothing will ever scrub out. Too much death and blood. She thinks she feels a prescence still here. \"Freddy...\" she hears herself whisper through the darkness. There's a slow, heavy shifting feeling in the atmosphere, like a sluggishly awakening beast; \"what are you sorry for?\" Months fly by. She looks through so many old archives on the internet whenever she has the time, it's enough to send her girlfriend crazy. But she needs to know. She needs to. Freddy Newendyke was buried in San Gabriel Cemetery. So that's where she was driving her next day off. Rosaria couldn't stand graveyards. They made her too depressed. She would press her hands into her temples and whimper about all the pain and grief she could feel, all of the people who hadn't wanted to go into the next life just yet, of the loved ones who had cried over their graves. She walked through the sun-baked earth and green grass, past the rows and rows of stone and inscriptions, until she was drenched in a dripping layer of perspiration. It took her a whole hour to find him. The headstone was small and simple. The inscription was brief; Frederick Newendyke. October 23, 1992. 28 years old. Loved son of Ada. Friend of Randy. It wasn't a headstone that had been forgotten. The marble was scrubbed down and clean, but there were no flowers adorning it. Stepping closer, she suddenly spotted something. Still wrapped in it's plastic, slightly grubby looking, tucked up against one side of the gravestone...a comic book? Cocking her head, she looked closer. The Fantastic Four. He liked The Fantastic Four? She felt an odd kind've emptiness eating away at the insides of her stomach as she stared down with creased up, thoughtful eyes. She needed more answers. Freddy Newendyke - Ada Newendyke. ... ... December 16, 1998. Ada Newendyke died of sudden heart failure in her home, aged 59. It didn't say if she left anyone behind...no husband...no nothing. Was Freddy the only thing she'd ever had? Freddy Newendyke - Randy. ... ... Randy Holdaway was a cop too. Maybe he was the one who keep the gravestone clean, propped that old comic book by its side. Maybe he knew what had happened to him all those years ago. Maybe he'd been there. She found herself wondering if he had heaps and heaps of friends or only really a few. If he'd been a cocky young cop or more nervous and eager to please. If he thought going undercover was going to make him cool...whether he really knew what kind of shit he was getting himself into. Rosaria kinda... knew. Knew to just let her do her thing. \"Once I lived in a house where this teenage girl had...well...ended it all...I felt her there with me everyday,\" she told her quietly, as they curled up underneath the covers of the curvier woman's bed. \"The landlord told me what happened...it was so...cleansing to found out...to understand, y'know?\" Lindelle wanted to understand. It took a long time to connect with Randy Holdaway. He wasn't in the phone-book and she got caught up with work again, pushing her search briefly to the side. During one of her weekends, she went on the LAPD website and then onto the Community Police Station Address Directory. She rang each of them up, until someone recognized the name. She heard the phone being switched around and someone clearing their throat out scratchily at the other end of the line. Her breath seemed to catch uncomfortably against her voice-box. \"Mr Holdaway?\" she said timidly. \"Speaking.\" \"Uh...my name is Lindelle Alexander. I live at 5860 North Figueroa Street, Highland Park...there used to be a warehouse there, but there's apartment blocks now.\" There was silence at the other end of the line. Then a clearing out of his throat again. \"I bet that would be a shit place to live.\" \"Yeah, most people move out after a few months.\" \"Smart people.\" He was quiet again and she felt the nervousness clench in her lungs, like hot, sticky cement. \"Uh...it sounds stupid...but I think my apartment might be...situated in the spot, where...your friend passed away?\" \"Didn't pass anywhere, Miss Alexander. He was shot three times.\" \"I know...I know that...I don't mean any offense...\" \"None taken.\" \"Okay...cool. Uh...I don't mean to be a hassle but I was...uh...curious? Did you know who uh...put the...last...um...bullet in?\" She felt like an asshole. The guy probably didn't want some random stranger forcing him to remember his old friend being shot nearly twenty years ago. She should just say sorry and leave. \"Uh...\" the man's voice seemed flat, like he didn't want to betray a shred of emotion. \"That was Lawrence Dimmick.\" She'd seen a mugshot of him in the old archives online. He'd been about in his late forties, early fifties, when the robbery and massacre took place. Her spine tingled slightly and she felt the cold shudder run through her body like a big heavy wave. Why were you sorry, Freddy? You were a young cop...he was an old crook. What happened? Why did you still feel so guilty? \"Were...were they close?\" \"What dya mean?\" \"Was your...friend and Dimmick...were they close?\" He didn't say anything for awhile, as though he was thinking about it, taking himself back to that time in his life so long ago. \"I guess...he got along with him the most...bit of a surprise...\" \"Why?\" \"I dunno, thought he'd click more with the people around his own age.\" If they got along the best, why did he shoot him? \"Did he shoot anyone else...Dimmick I mean?\" He seemed to be lost in memories now, voice dark and thoughtful. \"Yeah...we always found that confusing in hindsight. He shot Cabot and his son, even though they'd worked together for years.\" And then he turned the gun on the undercover cop. Why kill his old colleagues and then his new friend? Cabot must've found out that Newendyke was working undercover. He was a hardened criminal after all...he would've put two and two together. But why not just shoot the cop who'd betrayed his trust? Why shoot Cabot and his son as well? \"Why did he shoot them all?\" \"I don't know. I've been trying to work it out myself.\" Unless he just went into violent frenzy at the thought of the cops closing in on him. But that didn't make sense, because he was a hardened criminal as well, who should've been able to handle himself. And why did he shoot his boss? Why ? \"I don't think anyone really knows except the people who were there...\" he was saying. At those words, a thought suddenly occured to her. \"What was the name of the guy who got out alive?\" \"Oh, that was Kerabatsos...I remembered his first name sounded girly, he'd go crazy if someone called him by it. Uh...oh yeah Madison Kerabatsos...that's why Cabot called him Mr Pink apparently, just to fuck with him.\" \"Mister...Mister what?\" \"Oh, they went by code-names, make it harder for the police to track 'em down,\" he snorted with a bitter kind've laughter. \"Lot o' help that was.\" \"Who was...?\" \"Oh... he was Mr Orange and Dimmick was...uh...Mister...Mister...White, yeah Mr White.\" \"Is Kerabatsos out of jail?\" \"Nah...stealing diamonds and shooting a few cops got him in there for a damned long time. He's in Folsom.\" \"Okay. Thank you, Mr Holdaway.\" \"It's fine.\" There was a slight awkward pause before he cleared his throat for a final time and hung up. She looked up on google How to send a letter to Folsom state . She clicked on a link that gave her addresses and phone-numbers. Inmate Name, ID Folsom State Prison P.O. Box 715071 Represa, CA 95671 Down at the bottom of the page, it said Do an inmate search in California. She clicked it, \"agreed\" to the terms and conditions, before moving onwards. She typed his name into the search bar and clicked the final button. She found him pretty quickly and wrote his name and ID out on the front of her envelope, before she slid the folded paper inside. She wondered if it sounded stupid or not... Dear Mr Kerabatsos, You don't know me. My name is Lindelle Alexander, and I live in an apartment block which used to be a warehouse, where you were caught twenty years ago. It's a bit of a shithole really. No-one stays for very long. I've stayed the longest. I think my apartment is situated in the place where Mr Orange died. I have lots of dreams about blood and gunshots. I think I can still feel him there, like he doesn't want to move on. I talked to a cop that used to work with Mr Orange. Apparently he was very close with Mr White, but what I don't understand is why Mr White shot Joe Cabot and his son and then Mr Orange as well. They'd worked together for years and it doesn't make sense to me that he'd just shoot them all like that. Why not just shoot Mr Orange, because he was a cop? I thought as you were there, you might know. I feel like I need to help his spirit move on. That sounds really stupid, I know. But I feel him there with me everyday. He feels really really, guilty about something and I really need to help him. I'd love it if you replied, if it isn't too much of a hassle for you to remember. Hope you're well. Yours sincerely, Lindelle Alexander. She sent it off on her way to work the next day. The dreams were getting worse and worse. It was almost like he knew she was there, trying to talk to him. Trying to help. Trying to reach out. In the bathroom, she saw... something in the bathtub. Lying in a pool of bright red blood. Sweaty white skin and dank, slick hair. She tried to step closer, tried to look and there was a noise like someone was choking on something, before the figure sunk away once more. S-shit, I'm gonna to die Larry, I'm gonna die... And the gunshots suddenly sounded more clearly then ever. Bang. Bang. Bang. And a primal, animalistic sobbing filled her head and she woke up with the sickening feeling of shame closing in on her, like black tar filling up her lungs. She stayed with Rosaria as much as she could to escape it all. Lindelle Alexander, First off, I can't swear in these letters cause they check 'em and I want to be out on good behavior. I don't know why you want to talk about all that airy-fairy crap. (And crap isn't a swear-word by the way.) There all dead and no-one's going Sixth Sense on you, lady. I'd recommend you get some medication for that. I've moved the hell on with my life. (Hell isn't a swear-word either, it's in the bible alright?) Anyway, if your really that concerned, Mr Brown thought Mr Orange and Mr White were doing each other, but I didn't pay attention to all that idle high-school gossip. I'm not interested in two guys screwing around, I got more important things to worry about. I don't know if they were and I honestly don't care, but White beat me up when I said something mean about Orange, my ribs are still crappy cause of that bastard. White went nuts and shot Cabot and his son cause they said the kid was a cop and Cabot was gonna shoot him. Seriously, White was unhinged. The most unprofessional bastard I've ever met. Look I'm fifty-one for christ's sake, all that crap happened twenty years ago. They pulled the goddamned warehouse down and everyone died but me and I'm gonna be in jail for a long time, okay? Why do you care? If a spooky ghost cop is bleeding on your carpet, then move the hell out. It ain't rocket science, lady. Hope you have a good life and stuff. And thanks for the letter I guess. M.K. \"I told you! Didn't I tell you?\" \"What?\" \"Tragic love story, I told you!\" \"We don't know if they were together. The only people who really know are them. And they're dead.\" \"No I bet they were! It's so sad...it's like out of a movie or something...\" Lindelle didn't reply. She thought she had an idea now about what happened in that warehouse all those years ago, but of course...she wasn't ever going to be a hundred per cent sure. She wished there was a way to help. Did Dimmick die, hating that kid? Did he shoot him with rage pulsing through his veins? Is that why Freddy felt so guilty? He shouldn't feel so ashamed. He was just doing his job. \"No...no...I bet the older guy wanted to die with him or something...before the cops took them away and they'd never see each other again.\" \"That's very optimistic. He was probably just pissed off he was lying the whole time...\" \"C'mon, your ruining the romance!\" \"I'm just being logical. We don't know if there was anything going on between them.\" Rosaria fixed her with a sudden steely gaze. \"If one of your oldest friends was going to shoot me, what would you do?\" Lindelle fell quiet. She knew Rosaria had her in check-mate now. \"I'd...I'd kill them.\" Rosaria smiled at her. \"My point has been proven correct!\" \"Whatever...your crazy.\" She didn't know how she could convince whatever part of him was still here, that it wasn't his fault. That he didn't need to feel bad anymore. That he had to move on. \"Hello Mr Holdaway?\" \"How are you Miss Alexander?\" \"I'm good thank-you...I've got one las question and then I'll leave you alone forever.\" \"Right.\" \"Do you know who was on scene after Dimmick and your friend...passed on?\" \"Gerald McNamara speaking. ... ... ... The one kinda unusual thing I thought about it all in hindsight is that...uh...I didn't pay attention when we were there, collecting all the evidence and sectioning everything off. But I realized later...Dimmick? He'd been crying. ... ... Yeah. And another thing...I heard some of the other cops talking about it. Dimmick got blown away by the police when he shot the kid. But it was so odd...he ended up in this position on the ground, kinda...kinda curled up in his direction. He was reaching his hand out for him. And... Wait... The kid was too. They're fingers were touching. Everyone was whispering about that and the rookie with his ear cut off. I always just assumed he wanted to protect him, even when they were both passed on to the next life. ... ... Dimmick? He didn't have no family left or nothing. He was cremated somewhere, I don't know. That shit was ages ago, 'scuse my language...yeah I was young then...all that blood's kinda...kinda never left me, y'know? I just...can't forget it. ... No thank-you. I hope I helped you find some answers. Have an excellent day, Miss Alexander.\" She didn't know what to say. She sat on the cold tiles of her bathroom and whispered to anyone who could hear her, he didn't hate you. It wasn't your fault. He was protecting you even when you both died. She said it over and over again, but the dreams just got more and more violent. In her dreams she saw a man with a waxen white face, in a black suit and soggy, red shirt screaming on her bathroom floor, screaming and crying, dripping sweat and blood and tears. Larry I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry... You don't have to be sorry anymore, you don't have to, it's okay, she begged him and the figure on the ground disappeared into an ocean of congealed scarlet again. Rosaria slept over once. She wanted to help, but she had to walk out in the middle of the night. She couldn't handle the intensity of the pain, emotional and physical. She said she could feel the bullet digging into her stomach. It was growing almost exhausting waking up every morning, her heart a raw ripped open wound, her face and her pillow soaked with tears. And she wished she knew how to make it all okay for him. \" I think...I think we need to tell him. \" But she told him every night. Told him when she woke up. Told him when she got home from work. Told him when she ate her breakfast. You need to move on. You don't need to be ashamed. He loved you. He protected you. She got nothing but a horrible aching agony back. \"No...no I think we need to tell him. Really tell him.\" You mean...? Holdaway rang her to tell her the twenty year anniversary of his death was in a couple of days. He was going to visit him at the graveyard and she was welcome to come along as well. Rosaria climbed in the driver's seat beside her and asked if they could stop by at the florist along the way. They drove through the roads in silence. It took her a lot quicker to find his headstone this time. Rosaria bit her pink-painted lips, face going pale as they walked past the graves. Her chubby hand was trembling in hers and her dark eyes were wide and damp. Standing over the simple grave was a tall, hunched over African-American man, his greying hair cut short, stomach bulging slightly over his belt. He nodded slightly as Lindelle sidled up beside him, staring down at the cold marble stone. No-one said anything. They just stood there in silence for what seemed like forever. At one point, Lindelle walked away to let Holdaway talk to his old friend in privacy. Lindelle was only a stranger. She didn't even know the guy. But she felt like she did. She felt like she had a connection somehow. She'd been six in 1992. Why did she care? Holdaway nodded at her again as he walked off down the path between the graves, a bottle of water and a rag in his hand. He'd wiped down the headstone again. And now he was going home. Rosaria took her hand as they walked forward. The other woman handed their purchase from the florist into her arms. \"D'ya think it's cheesy?\" Lindelle asked her quietly. Rosaria eyes were sad and her smile was small and bittersweet. \"No...and I don't care if you do.\" She smiled a little back and Rosaria let her go up to the grave on her own. She squatted down to prop the three white roses against the headstone, next to the old battered comic. Licking her lips, she tried to think of what to say, wishing Rosaria was their to do it for her. \"Freddy?\" she told the headstone in a tiny voice and she felt the soft breeze brush through the trees and the grass, white petals quivering slightly in the wind. She swallowed down the heavy tightness that was growing heavier and heavier in her throat. \"Freddy...you don't...you don't know me...I live in the place where you died...and - and I know a part of you is still there.\" The plastic of the old comic book crinkled in the breeze and she felt it brush her dark hair down over her face. \"I've talked to people about...about Larry... And I don't think you know, but...even when he was dead, he was reaching out for you. Like l-literally on the floor of the warehouse. All these cops saw him trying to hold your hand when you were both already dead. He was trying to protect you even after you were both...both gone. And that meant...that meant he didn't hate you.\" That faint breeze seemed to still slightly. The birds chirped around the trees and the branches and the grass threw back gold specks of light into the bright blue sky. She breathed in hard, her chest hard and tight with held back emotion. \"And that means you don't have to feel so...so guilty anymore. You...you never had to feel like that in the first place. You can...move on now...\" And she sat back on her heels, biting into her lip into she felt like the pink flesh would break. The air was calm and steady around her, the birdsong still calling. What was she expecting? Something out there to whisper out a reply on the breath of the wind? There was nothing. Just a slow silence. Rosaria's arms were warm and comforting and Lindelle's eyes were damp as she pushed her face into the other woman's neck. They drove themselves back home to Rosaria's place and the other woman tucked her up in warm cozy blankets. And all she wanted to do was just sleep and sleep forever. When she was back at her apartment block again, Rosaria walked in with her. She frowned a little, crease appearing between her eyes, before she rubbed at the middle of the chest in vague confusion. \"It feels...different...\" Lindelle didn't say anything. She didn't have to. She could still... feel him. Just like she felt him at the graveyard. Just like she felt her mother in her old house...her Grandparents at their graves and their homes. There was something more serene in the air now, something cool and untroubled. \"The...sadness is still here,\" Rosaria said quietly. \"But there isn't so much misery anymore. Or pain...\" \"Yeah...I think he understands now...\" Rosaria pulled her into a bone-crushing hug. Her strong strawberry perfume filled up her nose and made her feel safe and warm and just...just whole . That night, she dreamt of walking into her tiny living room and looking out towards her doorway. She thought she saw something in the shadows, but she wasn't sure. She smelt smoke and saw the faint glow of the cherry from a cigarette, flickering in the darkness. And then it disappeared, away into the corridor. A warm presence passed by her side, drifting forward from the bathroom, the hair prickling at the back of her neck as it floated past her. She felt it move towards the open doorway. And then it was gone. She felt strangely empty for a few minutes, standing still and motionless in her living room. And then she heard it. Out in the corridor. A muffled sobbing. It sounded like everything weighing you down in the world had finally let up after such a very, very long time. The wet sniffling was mixing up with soft little comforting shushing noises. She swore she saw something warm and golden glow out from inside the hallway, before it returned slowly back to darkness. And when she woke up in her bed in the early hours of the morning, she swore she heard a faint voice echoing soothingly in her head like a mantra; It's okay kid...I got you... I got you... ...your safe now. ","Summary":" Nearly twenty years ago, her apartment block had once been an old abandoned warehouse. No-one ever "},{"Movie":"Reservoir Dogs","Title":"Tough Guy","Author":"coffee shop poet","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7584031","Passage":"[Chapter 1] There's a little diner, on the corner of Wilshire. It's a rundown piece of shit, old as Moses and wearing a lifetime's worth of wear on its crumbling plaster face, but hell if it doesn't boast the best cup of Joe for blocks. Down a ways there's a diner who tries to best it with the cup of shit they try to pass off as 'one hundred percent Columbian brew and don't you forget it!'. We all know better around here. There's no competition. You can practically smell the seething South American jungle the second you walk through our door. Doesn't get any fresher than that – and don't you forget it. The scene sets like this, see: Johnie's Coffee Shop. Three a.m. and raining like cats and dogs outside our smudged, half-fogged windows sitting in their peeling blue frames. Out back, the busboys are yammering in broken English over a few smokes and the latest edition of Playboy ( I'd like to get mi manos on those tatas, 'ombre!) . The cooks move about, restless, some of them pulling agonized faces at the clock every now and then as it refuses to move faster (they got kids to feed and wives to fuck and there's just not enough light in the day for it all). There's a few customers, scattered here and there and cocooned in all the cheap comfort a pleather seat and good conversation can afford. Everything smells like hot grease and stale smokes. An undercurrent of fresh coffee wafts by my sleepy senses as I walk through the door covered in lost pet flyers and Big O's (down the street, monstrous pink donut on top, you can't miss it) latest deals on fresh donuts. The little welcoming bell chimes in my wake. I've almost a mind to grab myself a cup of Johnie's best brew, slide into a cracked cream-colored booth, and familiarize myself with a glance at the Times. The idea sounds almost too heavenly in its sweet domesticity to a girl who practically lives on her feet. But duty calls. My shift starts in five minutes and I've got no time to be ruminating over the hopelessness of the world and everyone stuck in it. Here at Johnie's, it's like a family. The home away from home deal, one I never really bought into. Home is a place that can't possibly be imitated – especially not by a few lewd busboys, a tight-knit band of tired, snappish waitresses, and those cooks in the back that could give less of a fuck about the shit they're serving to the general public. But the policy is, nevertheless – your coworkers are your family. Treat them like such or, if you don't like it, find yourself another job. Apparently everyone gets along just fine, going about their business, sidestepping trouble and their dickhead of a manager with eyes installed in the back of his horns. But that could just be the indifference talkin'. No one really loves waiting on people who can't be bothered to tip or treat the people who handle their food with a little respect (an unwise move in my opinion…I've served many a hamburger with a little special secret ingredient hidden in the meat). One of the boys from the back slithers through the double doors. He reeks of cigarettes and has a smile on his face as wide as the Grand fuckin' Canyon. \"Hiya toots .\" It really is hilarious, the way they say toots like they're cool shit but really its sounds like slang for flatulence. But hey, family is family. I flash him a smile as I finish tying off a sailors knot to keep my apron in place. Last week it was falling all over the customers' food. Dickhead didn't like that so much and thought that taking a good portion of my tips might make up for the flood of complaints he received regarding the 'sloppy waitress with the ass'. I plow through the double doors leading out into the coffee bar, all of which smells like it's been bathed in Pine Sol. Sweets (I don't know everyone's names yet and the busboys' monikers are much less of a hassle to remember) is organizing sugar packets by color a way's down, propping up her chin in the palm of her hand in a perfect display of insufferable boredom. She's a dinner shift rookie, never waited on a table in her life before this week. One look at her drooping eyes and flyaway hair (if Dickhead were around she'd be penalized for such a 'sloppy' appearance) could tell you a good long story about a girl with pricey dreams of going to school and getting herself an education. Most of us here are going down that path. I wish I could say I wasn't one of them. \"You look like you could use a good hot cup of Johnie's house brew,\" I tell her. She sighs heavily, blowing out a long, impatient breath which sends her blonde fringe flying. \"If I have to even look at another fuckin' cup of coffee I'll scream.\" This coming from a girl who's only been here a week. I look around. Everyone seems less tense. There's a hint of mutiny in the air – but where, oh where, is our Captain? I address Girlie who's coming in to fetch a pitcher of tepid water. \"Where's Dickhead?\" \"Probably somewhere sucking corporate ass,\" she mumbles, bending over to select the pitcher with the least amount of ice floating around at the top. \"How should I know? I ain't his keeper.\" She stalks off with all the regal presence of an Irish queen, red hair perfectly slicked back into its carefully arranged bun as always. Girlie really is the envy of the scarce female population here at Johnie's Coffee Shop. Dickhead was never on her ass for anything except for an occasional slip of the Old Country temper. The dinner rush has long since slowed down. There's remnants of the bustle here and there, probably a result of a lack of Dickhead's presence, but mostly there's only evidence of a quiet, easygoing place that people come to in order to escape the humdrum of city life. It's a chatting place, a waiting place, a place to come to when you want to break up with a clingy girl. Older couples come here for the early bird specials and coffee (blacker than black, hotter than hot). Kids wander in after a long night of painting the town red for a pick-me-up. It really is an iconic little joint, keeping time with the rest of the city, watching it grow from the sidelines. I couldn't imagine Wilshire without it. I check my watch one more time. Three o' nine. Sugar's been sorted, the coffee's been brewed in preparation for the surge of early risers and insomniacs that should be coming in soon. I've got no regulars to speak of, not like Girlie or Dollface. They've got a few guys that come in here who tip them well in exchange for good service and a little harmless flirting here and there. I haven't been here long enough for regulars, kinda like poor Sweets (who, right now, is struggling to make out an order of hotcakes from this geezer with a frail, strained sort of voice). It's a process, one that can't be rushed. You've gotta get to know people, really know them. Their quirks, their preferences, tidbits of their lives, and it helps to know whether or not they like ketchup on their scrambled eggs. Asking how they've been or after the health of wives and daughters really impresses a man whose well-being has been practically nonexistent all day at work. But sometimes it really all just boils down to whether you've got mile-long legs and a pair of perky breasts that are perfect for ogling. Girlie gets the best tips with her biting wit and spirited temper. The rest of us females with the personality of a wet mop, well…we do the best we can. I decide to straighten up behind the bar, grabbing the nearest broom and assessing the damage that a plate of spilled French fries has done. A few have been mashed into the flat, scuffed surface of the tile, but mostly a good sweep job should do the trick. I'm about ready to ask one of the hombres in the back where the dust pan is (cause god forbid it should be with the broom) when Girlie comes rushing by, not a hair out of place. \"Could you grab that one for us, Lise?\" The way she's asking it – it ain't a question, it's more like a declarative statement – You will grab that one. I know better, even in my short days as waitress at Johnie's, than to cross Girlie. She passes me by, dodging the broom handle, and disappears into the back. I'm already lifting the latch on the little maroon and black gate leading into the back of the kitchen, pen and notebook in hand, when I see Sweets duck out of the door. The exhaustion has all but drained out of her face as she greets her greasy-looking boyfriend with a semi-nice car, who are waiting for her at the curb. Dollface will be coming in soon to start her shift. \"Which one is 'the one'?\" I call over to Girlie. She's busy with a customer, so mostly all I receive is a dirty look and a nod in the right direction. I follow her line of sight to a lone wolf sitting in the booth farthest away from what little noise our hoppin' hangout might boast at this hour. His booth is cradled in the section where the Budlight sign shines like a neon beacon for straggling alcoholics and the rock fascia (a decorative choice which still seems to confuse me a week after starting here) section of the restaurant is located. I can only see the back of his head, full of strawberry blond hair and gleaming beneath the gold-colored light fixtures. He seems to be pouring over the menu, engrossed in the activity. I mosey on over. No rush. On my way over, I make sure I'm presentable (as best I can with no mirror in sight). I run my tongue over my teeth, checking for anything unsightly stuck in between them. Check. I fiddle with my hair for a moment before deciding there's no use, it's a regular rat's nest as usual. Check. My apron is neat, my hands are mostly clean, and I'm fairly certain I don't have anything on my face. Check. Ready for take-off. \"See anything you like, sir?\" He looks up from his menu. Interesting looking fellow, not necessarily in a bad way. I find a pair of deep-set green eyes blinking at me almost blearily, as if the brain behind them could use a good strong cup of coffee for a wake-up call. Greased back strawberry blond hair, though it might only look tinted with red in this shitty lighting. It's hard to tell how tall he is with him sitting down like this, legs outstretched beneath the table and shoulders digging into the headboard of the booth, but I can tell he's no Schwarzenegger type. Must think he's some cool shit or something, wearing a leather coat that looks like it belongs to his much bigger father. We're both assessing one another. The heavily lidded eyes squint a little, taking me in (kinda bony in a starving art student sort of way; nondescript brown hair tucked behind freckled ears in a slapdash ponytail; eyes underlined in dark circles from putting in too many long hours; a smattering of freckles on pale cheeks). He seems to decide I'm about as threatening as an ankle-biter and with a click of his tongue he returns to the menu. \"Heard you guys got the best cup of shitty coffee in town,\" he says in his best 'tough guy' voice (in that scrawny eleven year old with a raging boner for the Sex Pistols kind of way). \"The very best,\" I reply, doodling a little heart in the corner of the first page of my notebook. \"Some say you can even smell the jungle if you stick your nose far enough into the thick of it.\" \"What do you think?\" I pause, my hand falling away from the paper. \"I think it's a shitty cup of coffee.\" He laughs a little. \"Then a shitty cup of coffee it is.\" \"No 'greasy food' chaser?\" He shakes his head, handing me a menu that's long since seen its better years. I don't even bother scribbling down the order. Coffee. Simple enough. It's a task I could recall in my sleep. And even if I was some sort of brainless dope who couldn't remember how to tie her own shoes, it's one I've done enough times that I could probably do it with my eyes closed by now. Pour coffee, offer cream and sugar, make sure the cup stays filled. Dickhead gets real sore about that. Keep the customer's cup full. If it's not full at all fuckin' times, I dock your tips. \"What's your name?\" Tough Guy pulls me back. I'd been walking away, my mind on pouring coffee and saving what little tips I can salvage from this dump, when his voice pipes up out of that lonely little corner. I shuffle back (goddamn, my dogs are already barkin'). \"What was that you said?\" He's doing that squinting thing again with his eyes. \"I asked what your name was.\" \"My proper English christening? It's Elise,\" I explain. \"But mostly these wetbacks 'round here call me Toots.\" \"I think I prefer Lise.\" \"You and me both, doll.\" His body shifts into a pensive, Bruce Springsteen writing deep shit at his desk sort of pose. It completely cancels out the cool Tough Guy look I've come to associate him with. \"What's it like pushin' plates and pouring coffee for a living?\" \"It sucks,\" I tell him. \"But that's no eye-opener.\" \"Beats suckin' cocks.\" \"Don't be so sure. At least them gals earn some fat tips.\" I lean against the table (maybe I could try this whole flirting thing on for size). \"They might have dicks shoved down their throats on a daily basis, but hell if they ain't getting paid for it either.\" \"So what you're saying,\" he says, pausing to fish a cigarette out of his breast pocket. \"is that the cocksuckers of the world know where it's at?\" \"Why, you thinking about going into the business?\" I ask, nodding toward a couple of the more anxious waitresses. \"I know a few chicks who could use a good and proper sucking from a cool cat like you.\" \"Nah, I don't do fish,\" he says with a half-smile, casually thumbing over his shoulder. \"But I could do for that coffee.\" I've been dismissed. Well, can't say I didn't try. I spin on my heels, heading straight for the counter. Girlie's gone and dumped out a whole new crate of creamer packets to start putting out into little cracked dishes. The lack of business is boring her; I can see that roguish Irish temper glaring at me from behind the precious dollop of freckles on her nose. I scoot behind the counter just as she pitches a sugar packet at a leering busboy nearby. She doesn't look up from what she's doing as I bend down to fetch a pitcher and two mugs; I steal a bowl of creamers from her. \"What're you and Mr. Cool talking about over there?\" \"Cocksucking.\" \" What?\" I'm off before she even registers my answer. It really is completely dead in here. The last of the customers, both regulars, are carefully selecting toothpicks as Dollface rings them up at the register. The rest of the place is empty. It's just me and Tough Guy then. Back at the cool table, Tough Guy is building a tower of creamers. He's just about getting to a third tier when it all comes crashing down before him, like a pile of broken dreams. By now, he's shed his leather jacket. Just a white t-shirt underneath, tucked into white-washed jeans with a hole in the knee. Doc Martens on his feet. Yeah, this guy is a real badass. I set down the mug, the pitcher, and the bowl on the table without a word, holding the other cup off to the side. He pushes the creamer-bowl out of the way, reaching for the mug as I pour the coffee, as fresh as it'll get around here. It's still pretty warm, a good rolling tuft of steam floating off the black as black surface. Probably tastes like shit but hey – it's what we're known for. \"Who's that other mug for?\" He asks, shaking a white sugar packet. \"Nobody special,\" I reply. He pauses, looking around at the deserted floor for a long minute. Then he sits back down, resumes the shaking of his sugar, and doesn't look back at me as I stare blankly at him. Before long, his mouth opens. \"If it ain't for anybody special, why don't you pop a squat and tell me all about the secrets of shitty coffee shop waitresses.\" \"A boring conversation if I ever heard of one.\" Finally he looks up at me, the sugar all poured. He gestures to the empty seat across from him. \"Why don't you sit your tired ass down, pour yourself a cup, and try me.\" As you wish, your highness. I flop down on the booth, feeling it deflate underneath my ass as all the air escapes out of a deep gash (probably from a pair of keys or a loose pocket knife). Tough Guy pours me a cup, offering me sugar. I wave my hand. All of this without a word being spoken between us. \"So what is it do you do for a living, Mr. Tough Guy?\" He snorts deprecatingly, knocking back a good long drag. \"This isn't supposed to be about me.\" \"Well, I'm making it about you.\" With a roll of his eyes, he sits back into the booth and digs a fresh cigarette out of his pocket again. Must be one of those chain smokers who don't believe in lung cancer. \"I don't do anything.\" \"You don't work?\" \"Course I work. I ain't no fucking freeloader,\" he says, but I almost don't believe him. \"So what's your job? What do you do?\" He flashes me a wolfish grin, one that looks almost too devilishly comical to be real in this lighting. Outside, a bit of gray is beginning to line the horizon and spill over onto the walks. The air must be getting thicker with an early, smog-riddled mist. \"Fine, I get it,\" I sit back too, eyeing his pack of Marlboros, which are sticking out of the hidden breast pocket in his hot stuff leather jacket. \"This is one of those 'lonely conversations with a downtrodden waitress' instances. Well, if that's what this is, then I'll be wanting a cigarette for my trouble.\" \"Pushy broad, aren't you?\" I shrug as he pulls an enticingly long cigarette out of a nearly empty pack. \"Technically I'm on shift. I could get in a real deep pile of shit with my good old boss Dickhead for this.\" He lights me up, watching me closely as I take in the first drag. This Tough Guy, he does a lot of staring. It must be a tough guy thing to stare at women until they unveil the secrets of the female persuasion to them. I just hope he doesn't expect me to be throwing my underwear at him any time soon; I'm too tired for that shit. \"So, do I get to know your name?\" I ask, blowing my smoke at the window. \"Or should I just call you Tough Guy?\" \"Freddie,\" he says, and I'm pretty sure that's all the answer I'm getting. I'm looking at his hands, or rather giving them a quick once-over, when I notice the ring. It's nothing fancy, and at first I think it's a family heirloom or something similar, but then I remember – guys don't usually wear rings on their left hands unless… \"So, Freddie…\" I'm looking straight at him, wondering about his hair color again (what the fuck is it? Strawberry blond? Auburn?). \"You got a wife waitin' for you back home?\" \"Nope,\" he says, breathing out his answer like a sigh of relief. His hands fold in front of him. \"No missus.\" \"Widower?\" \"Divorced.\" \"Bully for you, Freddie.\" I flick a few ashes off the end of the smoke, checking for signs of Dickhead over Freddie's shoulder. \"I think the whole marriage thing is a big fucking hurricane of bad decisions. Turns tough guys like you into pussies and nice girls into nags. All this for what? A couple of rings? A means to survival? Eh, fuck it - ain't worth it.\" \"A bit young to be goin' around scorning men like some dried up old fucking prune,\" he looks me over. \"What, did some piece of shit fuck you over? Leave you for a girl friend? Run off with the best man?\" \"Nah, nothin' like that.\" I wave my cigarette, shaking my head. \"I just figured out young that men are dicks and there ain't no use in thinkin' you can change 'em.\" \"Am I a dick?\" \"By association, yes.\" \"But take association out of the equation – what do you got?\" My head tilts as I assess him, from the greased back hair and deep-set green eyes all the way down to the hole in the knee of his jeans. I take another puff of my smoke while I decide what it really is that I'm looking at. \"Tough Guy. Freddie by christening. Wears a leather jacket that hangs off him like a black sack and smokes too many cigarettes,\" I reply, shrugging my shoulders. \"What about him?\" \"What if he ain't a dick?\" Freddie shrugs back. \"What if he's a nice guy?\" \"Why do you care?\" \"Maybe I wanna introduce him to a pretty little waitress who works a few blocks down from where he works?\" The crook of his mouth turns up. \"He might be somethin'. Who knows?\" \"So this girl…\"I stub out the last of my cigarette, pulling the tepid coffee back toward me. Absently, I dip my finger in, test the temperature – yeah, no good – and push it back away. \"You think she's pretty, eh?\" \"She's all right for an aspiring cocksucker.\" \"A little too rough around the edges for this Freddie cat, huh?\" \"A little, maybe,\" he says. \"But Freddie, he's a tough guy. He could smooth those rough edges down with a good old dose of Tom Waits charm in no time. I bet you he'd have her worked over like putty in his fuckin' hands just like that.\" He snaps his fingers, emphasizing how quick he could get this job of his done. I pull a face. \"She never was a Tom Waits kind of girl.\" \"Mick Jagger?\" \"Nope.\" \"Cary Grant...\" I shrug again. \"Nope, nope and nope. Face it, guy. Ain't no way a cat like this Freddie is goin' to get her in the sack.\" \"Oh?\" Tough Guy raises his eyebrow and it's something straight out of a Bond movie. \"And what's so special about this broad that makes her too good for the likes of nice guy Freddie?\" \"Freddie ain't a nice guy, can tell you that right here, right now.\" I lean forward, as if sharing with this cat some secret of how the world works that he doesn't already know. \"You wanna know how I know?\" \"Yeah, I wanna know.\" I smile at him. \"Nice guys don't wear their wedding rings when they go out to pick up chicks. Simple as that.\" Freddie rolls his eyes. He then reaches for his ring, slipping it off one long, freckled finger, and sticks it in the breast pocket (right next to the carton of Marlboros). \"There. Now I'm a regular fucking Mr. Rogers.\" \"What's this obsession with being some nice guy? You know nice guys finish last.\" \"Everything I've heard tells me they finish first.\" \"Ha ha, you're a regular comedian,\" I reply (gotta love a dirty joke at four o' clock in the morning). \"But really – what gives?\" \"Nothing gives,\" he says. \"You see a pretty girl, you wonder where she's been, who she's been with, if you'd ever measure up to those other dopes lined up around the block to get with her just once. Simple as that.\" \"You're first in line, bub,\" I assure him, twirling my finger in the untouched coffee. He's still drinking out of his, though it must be cold by now. \"Congratulations. You're finally ahead in life.\" He's staring again. I have half a mind to ask him if his mother ever taught him that the practice is rude and frowned upon in good society. Not that I'm even remotely good society, but still – it's a bad habit I should break him of (if this should be the only time we ever talk, I want him to leave knowing something, having learned a thing or two). But as he watches me, his eyes following the curves and dips and shallows of my face, I realize I could give less of a fuck. It feels good to have someone see me for longer than it takes to ask for a bill, for a fresh cup of Joe. And not just someone – Tough Guy. He isn't bad to look at, not really. He's got a sense of humor, at least that is fairly easy to speculate. A regular catch from what I can see. That wedding ring, though. Divorced my ass. Mrs. Freddie is probably sitting at home wondering where her man has wandered off to as we speak. I can just see her now, standing in the kitchen with her little apron, waddling around the house with a hand on a pregnant belly (a boy, they both know it in their heart of hearts). Oh where can he be? Well, Mrs. Freddie – he's here, with me. Sitting across from a rundown waitress who's too broke to see straight. Not that I planned on being here. I steal another look over his shoulder. A few customers must have come in when I wasn't looking and Dollface and Girlie look none too happy with my lack of participation. I start to scoot out of my booth, taking my cup with me. \"Well, this has been a bucket of laughs, Freddie but…I think it's time I got back to work.\" He grabs my forearm, the callus chafing up against my skin. \"Wait just a second there, doll.\" If looks could kill, Dollface and Girlie would have to answer for my untimely demise right here, right now, in this sleepy little diner on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard. But Freddie here is gawking again, that bad habit of his that I didn't have a chance to break. His hold is soft, nothing desperate like one of those ' when will I see you again?' kind of vice grips like you see in the movies – when two strangers meet and fall instantly in love from the moment they lay eyes on each other. This is real life, and here is where reality reigns over simpletons like us. \"How much for a cup of coffee?\" \"Leaving so soon?\" He stands up, taking my arm with him. It seems that he is reluctant to let go, but across the room I'm getting death glares of all shapes and sizes. Freddie takes his sweet time in counting out the bills, unfolding them and folding them again, mouthing to himself how much is there as I stand, waiting, for him to let me go. At least his hand is warm and dry – not like those sweaty teenagers who come in looking for an unsuspecting ass to grab (mostly Sweets, but poor thing – she's not the most observant of us bunch). \"Take this up to the register for me, doll?\" I do as I'm told, leaving Tough Guy to stare pensively out the window again. The sky is completely gray now, no trace of darkness left. On the way over to the register I check my watch – five thirty eight. No wonder. It's just a good thing Dickhead wasn't here to witness my bad bad behavior, but he'll be coming in soon (can't afford to pay for bonehead mistakes like this one with hard-earned tips). I count out Tough Guy's change and I'm about to take it back when I look up just in time to watch him stroll out the door. He walks like a cowboy from a spaghetti western, a characteristic that should come across as silly but only seems to make me wonder what he looks like naked. I watch him saunter off, the leather jacket thrown over one shoulder like he's some sort of GQ model, and for a second I find myself thinking – in some strange midget sort of way, he kinda is. Well, it's over – nothing but an untouchable thing of memory now. Back at the table, I'm clearing away the aftermath of his visit and collect everything to the edge of the table. Pitcher first, then the mugs, leaving the cream and sugar for the customers to come in later and claim this booth. In my rush to appease Dollface and Girlie (it looks like Chica came in when I wasn't looking), I upset Tough Guy's coffee cup (not much left in it, but still there's a mess) and it spills all over the table. With a fuck and a shit and a few godamnit's thrown in here and there, I get to work mopping up the strong-smelling puddle. One of the napkins had been in the splash zone; it was soaking wet and a sort of tawny, almost caramel color. And it's as I pick up the napkin, ready to bunch it up and throw it on my tray, when I feel it. It's stiffer than wet napkin, but small – almost rectangular in shape. I peel away the remnants of coffee-stained material, some of it tearing easily underneath my eager fingertips, but I finally free the little rectangular object hiding beneath. It's a business card. But there's no business information on it – just a blank card with some smeared ink beginning to bleed through. It's still legible as I peer down at it, wondering what the fuck this is all supposed to mean. And then, as I read the running print, I start to smile in spite of myself. Cause it's all just so fucking funny that the world made sense before he walked through that door. Now, I'm not sure what to make of it. But I'll figure it out again, I always do – somehow. Be ready for some regular Barry White shit when I come back. Have a coffee waiting for me. Blacker than black, one sugar, no cream. You'll sit your ass down, I'll tell your boss to fuck off, and we'll talk about absolutely nothing. I'll be back soon. Wait for me, huh? And Lise, you should know – nice guys sometimes don't g et to finish at all. Freddie.

The wait is over! In a fox hole, not far from where Copper, and his foster father, Chief and their owner, Amos Slade live, Vixey was pregnant. Tod was there beside her through it all. \"Tod, honey,\" an owl named Big Mama said, \"Your mother would have been so proud after all the times you've spent with her daughter in law.\" \"Thanks, Big Mama,\" Tod glanced up at her, \"I did it for the best.\" \"But Vixey can teach you more ways in the forest. For example, gathering food for your kits.\" Tod smiled, touched by his wise guardian's words, then turned back to Vixey. \"Vixey. Remember when we watched a mother quail and her seven babies one day while you showed me around in the forest and teaching me how to survive the uncertainties? I did not get what you meant by 'six', but now I do.\" The vixen was breathing deeply, but replied, \"Oh, Tod, I do.\" Again, Tod did not leave her side because that wasn't who he was. \"You sit tight, Vixey, darling,\" Big Mama told her, \"And Tod, stay here. Big Mama's gonna be right back. I just got to get Dinky and Boomer.\" In seconds, she left her branch. ... A gold finch named Dinky watched as his best friend, Boomer, the woodpecker drilled holes in one tree, where they can share a worm. To Dinky's amazement, Boomer grabbed one. \"Good work, Boomer. Now, let's split it,\" Dinky said eagerly. Boomer agreed and just when they were about to eat their lunch, a massive owl appeared before them. \"Phew! Good to see you, boys!\" she breathed, \"Vixey is about to have kits.\" \"Great Big Mama, you made us lose our lunch!\" Dinky snapped and without second thoughts, he dove down to get his and his partner's worm. \"I'm sorry, boys,\" Big Mama apologized. \"It's alright. Dinky's just grumpy because he's hungry,\" Boomer told her. \"NO, I'M NOT!\" Dinky boomed. \"YES, YOU ARE!\" Boomer shot back. \"There's no time for arguing, boys,\" Big Mama warned, \"Now, let's go!\" Not wanting her to lose her patience, they followed. ... Big Mama, Dinky, and Boomer rested on a branch, so they can each catch their breath. An hour went by and Big Mama ordered the woodpecker and sparrow to fly over to Copper's house. \"Oh, shucks!\" Boomer complained, \"We just got here not too long ago!\" \"Oh, it's been only an hour, but you wouldn't be long,\" Big Mama insisted, \"I assure you.\" \"Boomer, everything's going to turn out just right, you'll see,\" Dinky convinced, yanking Boomer's hair with his talons. \"B-b-b-but do you have to pull my hair every time, Dinky?\" Boomer scolded, \"It's driving me crazy!\" Then, Boomer flapped his wings over to Copper's behind his long-time pal. ... \"Copper!\" they called. \"Dinky? Boomer? Is that you?\" Copper inquired. \"For sure, kid,\" Dinky answered, \"But we got news for you: Your best friend and Vixey are having kits soon.\" Copper gently nudged a sleeping Chief aside. \"Chief, wake up.\" Chief woke up immediately. \"What is it, sonny?\" he asked, one eyebrow raised, sleepily. \"Tod and Vixey are having kits,\" Copper informed. \"Oh, we should signal our master!\" Chief confirmed. Without delay, he and his foster son hollowed for Amos Slade. Out came the hunter, who was stunned by the hollowing. \"What in blue blazes is going on here?\" he shouted. Copper gestured towards Widow Tweed's house. Unceremoniously, Chief and Amos followed in pursuit of Amos's neighbor. Amos knocked on Mrs. Tweed's door. \"Amos, what on earth?\" she asked tersely. \"Get out and you'll see,\" Amos Slade said, taking her by the hand, gentlemanly. Copper pointed toward the road that led to the Game Preserve. Now, everyone was in a rush. ... Every member was gathered to watch the fox pairing make a family of their own. It wasn't long after the baby foxes were given birth. The coon bloodhound was admittedly proud of his long-time friend's progress with Vixey and for being with her at all costs. \"I've officially become an uncle,\" Copper said, feverishly grinning. The vixen was washing up her litter of cubs, while Tod counted, \"One, two, three, four, five, SIX!\" \"I told you six would be just right,\" Vixey said with pleasure as she and Tod kissed with their noses. \"Hey, Chief, how's your leg treatin' ya?\" Tod asked. \"Better ever since the master unwrapped my cast,\" Chief replied. \"That fox of yours has done a great job,\" Amos complimented Mrs. Tweed. The little foxes reminded her so much of Tod when he was a youngster, covered in her laundry and thanks to Big Mama and Dinky. \"Tod, I hope you are very proud of what you've done,\" Big Mama praised, \"And honey, I'm very happy for you. You've become a father and soon, it'll be passed on for many generations.\" \"You know, Boomer? These remind me of that squirt that stood beside the fence,\" Dinky stated. \"Well, I can't believe my eyes, Dinky,\" Boomer said, rubbing his eyes in bewilderment, \"That farm boy has become a father!\" Soon, both Dinky and Boomer were gushing over the little ones once they became used to their company. Fate is left in store for the two birds, but that was another story… Author's note: Attention all FATH fans: This is my first ever multi-chapter of The Fox and the Hound . I've read Evil-Copper's story, The Past and the Present not too long ago when Tod and Vixey eventually have pups. It was a fascinating read. Then again, see you in the next chapter. Looks like I'm off to a good start![Chapter 2] Now, we see that Tod and Vixey officially had their kits. Tod and Vixey made wonderful parents just as she wanted. Moving right along, let's see what they're up to next. Every day, Vixey's kits grew up big and strong, and thanks to her milk she provided. As they grew older, Tod and Vixey had Chief watch them one day and the next day, the fox couple had Copper– \"Uncle Copper\" to watch the kits. In the midst of Chief babysitting them, he told them a story of how he met Copper, his encounter with Tod, his hunt with Copper and Amos, his next chase with their father, him being injured by a train, and having a broken leg. The cubs were listening, although they were disturbed, but Chief assured them that things turned out better just to improve their moods. \"Well said, Chief,\" one kit commented. In Copper's time of babysitting Tod's and Vixey's cubs, he clarified the time he became friends with their father, although Copper's owner, Amos Slade was disgusted and tied him up, and there became a time when he had to track down Tod as soon as Copper became a hunting dog. Again, the children were shocked, but Copper managed to soften the blow by convincing them that he became friends with Tod again after the fox risked his life to save his one true friend, Copper rescued Tod from a gunshot, and Amos Slade changing his mind to shoot Copper's only friend. \"That was a great story, Uncle Copper,\" one kit piped up. \"Yeah, and that was nice of you to save our dad from getting shot,\" declared another. \"Uncle Copper, is it true that you were close friends with our father?\" one kit named Precious asked. Copper nodded. \"Yes and I did everything I could to keep it that way, though we became enemies at one point. We're friends now and nothing has changed since then, not even when you came along, which is a true blessing.\" \"Thanks,\" returned Precious, who asked him a question. She out of all the kits liked Copper. \"Anytime, Precious,\" Copper said, winking at her. \"Children, we're home!\" Vixey called. \"Thanks for watching the kits, Copper,\" Tod told him. \"Yepe, you're very welcome, Tod,\" Copper replied. \"Children, look what we've brought for you!\" Vixey exclaimed excitedly. \"DINNER!\" shouted the eager kits. \"Well, I'm gonna go,\" Copper sighed. \"We'll see you tomorrow,\" Tod reminded him as Copper departed. \"Thanks, and I'll see you then,\" Copper said. \"See you tomorrow, Uncle Copper!\" yelped the kits. ... The next day when Copper came by to babysit, they were thrilled. Tod and Vixey also invited Dinky and Boomer to babysit their kits. \"Now, you be good to Dinky and Boomer,\" Tod warned, \"After all, we invited them.\" \"We will!\" his children promised. \"And you boys treat our kids nicely,\" Vixey warned the birds. \"And Big Mama might come over to watch you, kids,\" Tod finished his word. \"We're going out for a walk,\" Vixey announced. \"Mom, why can't we go?\" one of them asked. \"Oh, you will when you're older,\" Vixey assured. \"Unless it's an emergency,\" Tod added. \"Yeah, like going to the bathroom,\" one kit named Rascal complained sarcastically. \"No, Rascal, I mean if something were to happen to me or your mother,\" Tod corrected, \"Uncle Copper may take you out for a walk.\" Vixey laughed. \"He takes after you, Tod.\" \"Oh, I misunderstood,\" the kit who spoke to his father returned. \"Tod, ready to go?\" Vixey, who waited outside, asked sweetly. Tod turned to her and said, \"Yeah, I'll be right there.\" To his cubs, he added, \"You take care now. See ya when we get back.\" Then, he left to follow Vixey. As soon as the fox couple left, Dinky and Boomer landed in front of the offspring. \"Hi ya, kids,\" Dinky greeted. \"How're ya doing?\" Boomer asked them. \"Great, Dinky and Boomer!\" they answered simultaneously. \"Good,\" Dinky said. \"How are you?\" one kit inquired. \"We're doing good, too,\" Boomer answered, \"We just had breakfast.\" \"What did you have for breakfast?\" asked one of the kits. \"Worms,\" Dinky and Boomer answered. \"EW!\" they gagged. \"Disgusting,\" Copper gagged, \"But that's what birds eat.\" \"Can you tell us a story?\" one kit asked. \"PLEASE?\" the rest asked in unison. \"Yeah, sure, why not?\" Dinky replied. \"YAY!\" they cheered. The two birds took turns telling the story. Boomer told them about how they first met their father by the fence where his mother dropped him off. Dinky accentuated their encounter with Squeaks, the caterpillar, thinking he was a worm that needed to be eaten. Boomer went into detail regarding his argument with his best friend, Dinky, after Dinky accused him of losing Squeaks as their breakfast. \"I really didn't cause us our breakfast,\" Boomer pointed out. \"Oh sure,\" Dinky said, sarcastically. \"But let's not argue in front of the kids, alright?\" Boomer scolded. Dinky let out an angry sigh, \"Fine.\" \"Anyway, we taught your father the basics about how to be careful and avoid trouble with the hunter and his dog, Chief and Copper would someday be a killer,\" Boomer stated, \"We proved it to him by showing him skins.\" \"Not anymore,\" Copper reminded him, not wanting to upset the kits just like the day before. \"We're not finished yet, though,\" Dinky informed, waving a wing to show emphasis, \"Before we headed south for the winter, we had to try to catch Squeaks yet again, but he went inside Mrs. Tweed's house to make himself comfortable and boy were we jealous!\" \"We nearly froze our beaks off!\" Boomer explained. \"But I told Boomer that sitting there talking and shivering wouldn't do us any good. So, I promised that we'll get Squeaks in the springtime. On our way, we said goodbye to Big Mama and she wished us luck as we flew away.\" In the middle of the story, they cut to the chase when by the time they reoccurred, Tod was all full-grown and endeavored on their pursuit on Squeaks, but this time, above the pipes and onto the powerlines. The birds had failed again. \"That night, we overheard the hunter yell at Mrs. Tweed, accusing your father of causing Chief to almost die,\" Dinky went on. \"Now, we'll come to the point when your father met your mother,\" Boomer put in, \"He tried to impress her by trying to catch a fish.\" \"But that didn't go well,\" Dinky said, \"And we couldn't help but laugh until he got mad and called her a name.\" Suddenly, a huge owl swooped down in between the birds. \"Hello, boys.\" \"Hello, Big Mama,\" they said nervously as if they were scolded. \"I didn't mean to startle you,\" she told them, then to the kits, she said, \"Your father called your mother a 'silly, empty-headed female'.\" They gasped. \"But don't tell your mother and father that. Now, he tried to impress her again, but this time, by giving her a flower; however, it made them sneeze. That didn't matter as long as they had each other and gave each other the love they deserved.\" \"How romantic!\" a female fox kit mused, thoughtfully. \"You're absolutely right, child,\" Big Mama told her, drawing a finger under the fox's chin, \"It is romantic.\" \"We were just too interested in those foxes being together,\" said Boomer with a laugh. \"We couldn't control the feeling,\" Dinky added, \"But Big Mama shooed us away just so your parents can have some alone time.\" \"They needed privacy,\" Big Mama agreed. \"The next day, we discovered that Squeaks became a butterfly,\" Boomer returned. \"All this time, he was a caterpillar,\" Dinky said, dejectedly. \"It's alright, boys,\" Big Mama soothed, draping her wings around them, \"At least you've got worms to fed on. Real worms.\" \"Oh, Big Mama,\" Dinky blushed. \"It's true, Dinky,\" Boomer declared and giggled. ... At noon, Vixey said, \"Tod, I hope our kids are on their best behavior.\" \"Oh, I'll bet they are, Vixey,\" Tod responded, \"I'm sure of it.\" Changing direction, they went their separate ways, searching for food for themselves and their kits. ... The bear rose out to the surface and entered land. On his feet, he scrambled toward his den, vowing revenge on Tod and Copper, the two who had bitten him just to save Amos Slade from becoming bear chow. Presently, he had a new obsession greater than revenge: Vixey! Once inside, the vengeful bear dug out dirt and spread it on the cave walls to highlight his unhealthy obsession with Vixey. \"I shall display my revenge on that despicable hound dog and that treacherous fox for raking into my worthy fur. Oh, does it burn me, but though I am against foxes, the girl fox is just an exception! She's an angel! I'll lure her inside my depth myself!\" With that being said, he broke into fiendish cackles. ... \"Hey, Boomer, wanna go out and get some worms?\" Dinky asked. \"Sure,\" Boomer replied and started to follow. In that moment, they made loud noises, loud enough to scare the worms. \"Oh, you make such wonderful babysitters,\" Copper rolled his eyes in annoyance, then called, \"Hey, guys, you know you're gonna scare away the worms and starve to death!\" \"SORRY!\" Dinky and Boomer apologized, but continued on their way. The hound watched them go, then focused on the terrorized progenies. \"Are you kids okay?\" They nodded. \"That's good,\" Copper said. ... Tod found some squirrels he and his family can have for dinner. \"Vixey, I found dinner!\" he called, but to his dismay, Vixey was nowhere in sight. \"Vixey!\" the fox shouted. Panting from exertion, he muttered to himself, \"How can she be gone?\" Tod looked for clues. That was when his long-time friend showed up with Tod's descendants right behind him. \"Tod, what's wrong?\" Copper asked. \"Copper, it's Vixey! I don't see her anywhere!\" Tod replied, urgently, but managing to catch his breath, \"It's not like her to disappear on a time like this.\" Copper regarded the circumstance very seriously until an idea popped into his head. \"I know who will help us.\" \"Who?\" Tod inquired, inquisitively. \"Dinky and Boomer–that's who!\" Copper confirmed, \"Now let's go, we don't have time to lose.\" Into the clearing, they went. To be continued… AN: Well, the beginning of this chapter was fun to write. In the meantime, I'll have the next chapter up and ready. *A song that matches near the end of the chapter is \"Hellfire\" from The Hunchback of Notre Dame .[Chapter 3] Last time, we witnessed that Vixey had disappeared. We'll find out next on what happens to her. Thank you for your convenience! On a branch stood Dinky and Boomer. \"Hey, Boomer,\" Dinky said. Boomer turned around to face his best friend. \"What're we gonna do today?\" Dinky inquired. \"I don't know. Whatchu wanna do today?\" Boomer asked. Dinky shrugged his shoulders. \"So, what're gonna do today?\" \"I really don't know,\" Boomer replied, then became agitated, \"So, don't bother starting that question again!\" \"Dinky! Boomer!\" Copper called, his voice filled with worry. The birds were alarmed by Copper's call of distress. \"We need your help,\" he continued. \"What kind of help?\" Boomer asked. \"Vixey's missing and it's all my fault!\" Tod replied, sadly. Copper faced him and said, \"Tod, it's not your fault. You and Vixey were just going your separate ways to find food and I saw it, but you didn't see me. Who knows? Maybe she got lost or kidnapped. So, what could be worse?\" \"Tod honey, I'd say this Copper hound dog is right,\" Big Mama assured him, wrapping her wing around the fox, but Tod broke free from her embrace. \"Now let's go find Vixey!\" Copper ordered. \"Kids, this time, you're coming with us,\" Tod said, looking down upon them. \"Yay!\" the cheered. \"After all, she is our mother,\" a girl fox kit said. \"Yes, she is,\" Tod said, \"Now let's go. We have no time to lose.\" The kits did as they were told and they were ready for adventure. Even Big Mama, Dinky, and Boomer came along. ... Vixey was held captive at the giant bear's den. \"Don't be alarmed, my saint,\" the unblessed bear said, advancing himself in his cave. \"What do you want me in here for?\" Vixey asked, politely as she could, \"Even more important, I thought you were dead.\" \"Oh, but I managed to rise to the surface,\" the unholy demon replied, \"And I've got a new obsession.\" Vixey gawked at him and asked, \"And what is that?\" \"Well, it's just that I usually have a stereotypical attitude towards foxes,\" the bear answered with a smirk, \"But you make a perfect match for me.\" That made Vixey pretty mad. \"I do not!\" she responded defiantly, \"I've already have a mate! I love Tod and I will never mate you for you are a vicious beast who attacked his friend, then him!\" The unfriendly creature glared and snarled in frustration. \"We'll see about that!\" ... Meanwhile, Tod, Copper, Big Mama, Dinky, Boomer, and Tod's progenies were still hot in pursuit on finding Vixey. Abruptly, the kits got tired. \"Are you kids okay?\" Copper asked, racing over to them, \"Here, Uncle Copper will take half of you on his back.\" \"And I'll take the other half,\" Tod finished and they did just that. \"Aha! Footprints!\" Boomer called. The group followed the woodpecker. \"Yeah, and they belong to a bear!\" Tod affirmed. \"Could he be the one that you risked your life to rescue me from?\" Copper wondered. \"I don't know for sure,\" Tod replied, \"But we have to keep going. We can't lose Vixey.\" ... In the present time, Vixey escaped the den by going underneath the bear's stomach. At the right time, she found Tod, her offspring, Copper, Big Mama, Dinky, and Boomer. \"Tod! Big Mama! Dinky! Boomer! Copper! Children!\" Vixey called, catching her breath, \"Tod. Copper. The same bear that attacked you and he hunter is now after me.\" \"Looks like we have to lure him away,\" Tod said. In that moment in time, the bear had Vixey's scent and found her with her search party. \"So, Tod. Copper, we meet again,\" he taunted, \"And Tod, you even brought children.\" \"You will not lay a paw on Vixey,\" Copper growled, \"You hear? Not when we're here.\" \"You want her, you're going to have to go through me!\" Tod fumed. \"Oh, but I'm in love with your mate,\" the bear purred, \"I'm sure we can handle this without unnecessary violence.\" \"Liar! It's not love–it's lust!\" Tod retorted. \"And you always handle things with violence!\" seconded Copper, \"Even after my owner woke you up by mistake when he was about to catch my friend!\" Then he stopped to think. \"Even though that's what bears normally do when woken up.\" But the bear was looking at Tod's offspring. One of the girl kits, Precious interceded by scratching him on the nose. The bear roared in pain. The moment was seen as a distraction to Tod, Vixey, Copper, and the birds. \"Vixey! Kids! Get to the burrow!\" Tod commanded. \"But Tod-\" Vixey interjected. \"Just do it, please!\" Tod interrupted desperately. Without another word, Vixey and her kits rushed to the burrow, while Tod and Copper growled at the bear just to scare him away. He was taken by surprise this time, which was unusual. \"Let's go,\" Tod said afterward and on they went. ... \"Dad! Did you see what I did?\" Precious asked. \"Yeah, and you were brave, Precious,\" Tod replied, proud of his daughter's antic. \"You've had the guts,\" Copper said, admiring his niece's bravery. Even Vixey praised her for her courage. ... \"Next time, I'll get you and you'll be sorry!\" the bear growled, promising himself revenge on Tod, Copper, and Vixey. AN: Now you know what happened to Vixey and what the bear's passion for Vixey, one fox that he had interest in on his respective wasn't love; it was lust! That explains that in this story, the bear is similar to Judge Claude Frollo from The Hunchback of Notre Dame because they were both interested in someone in the species or group that they are supposedly against. Bear: Vixey Frollo: Esmerelda *They were known to often show prejudice in a particular sort. Bear: Foxes Frollo: Gypsies *Songs that incorporate this chapter are \"Monster\" by Meg & Dia, especially the male version and \"Hellfire\" from The Hunchback of Notre Dame .[Chapter 4] In Amos Slade's yard, Amos was petting Chief before he left. \"I'll be back, Chief, old boy,\" he said, \"I'm just going to see that fox's kits.\" Chief said nothing. He just sat there as he watched his master turn to leave. … On the way to the woods, Amos got lost and bumped into a bear–the same one that attacked him, Copper, and Tod once before. This time, the bear wanted his help. \"Oh good, you're here,\" said the unholy bear, \"You must have been on your way to visit the wretched kits.\" \"I-I-I thought you were dead,\" Amos stuttered. \"No matter,\" the bear said dismissively, \"I just need your help on getting my revenge against Tod and Copper.\" \"You mean my own dog and that fox that saved him and me?\" \"Yes, those two. They couldn't accept the fact that I am in love with Vixey.\" Amos Slade shook his head in disbelief, then snickered at the bear's remark. \"So, are you in?\" the bear asked impatiently. The hunter hesitated until, he shrugged his shoulders, conceding, \"Yeah, I'm in.\" \"You'll have a good time, you'll see,\" the bear said and added, \"In the meantime, get your gun.\" \"For what?\" Amos scowled suspiciously. \"Just in case,\" replied the unfriendly bear, \"And bring Vixey alive.\" And he was up to no good. He was up for not only revenge, but manipulation. … On the same day, Dinky, Boomer, and Big Mama babysat Tod's and Vixey's pups with their approval, but this time, the foxes also allowed the porcupine to babysit their kits, the same one who let Tod spend the night up on his tree. Copper, accompanied by Tod and Vixey, said on his way out of the burrow, \"See you when we get back, kids.\" \"Bye, Uncle Copper!\" they called. \"Hello, little ones,\" the friendly porcupine said. \"Hello!\" Tod's and Vixey's offspring said in unison. \"I knew your father,\" the porcupine continued, \"I let him stay in my tree. You can follow me if you want to.\" \"That'd be nice,\" Rascal piped up, although a little too quickly. \"Follow me,\" the porcupine returned and led them to his tree where he lived. As soon as they arrived, the porcupine told them about the time he stretched, waking up their father, causing him to tumble downward down to the mean, grumpy badger named Mr. Digger. Then, he confided to the kits that he reprimanded the badger by defending Tod's actions, stating that their father didn't mean any harm. \"Is that badger still here?\" Rascal asked. \"It's been a while since I've last seen him,\" replied the porcupine. \"I don't see him, either,\" Rascal confirmed. In the distance, a sound of danger occurred. It came from their archenemy, the one who had abducted their mother and he grew closer. \"Hide up in the tree with me, little ones!\" the porcupine ordered and the youngsters did as they were told. The porcupine comforted them. \"It's alright,\" he assured them. \"What if he tries to kill you next?\" Rascal asked concerned. \"Oh, I have quills.\" \"What are quills?\" Precious asked. \"There is no time to explain.\" Just when the bear was about to reach in, the porcupine bravely intervened by blocking his face with his quills. The bear roared angrily, but rotated to walk away in a different direction because his main target was Tod, Copper, and Vixey. Seeing that the bear was gone, the porcupine stated, \"It's safe now.\" He and the fox kits slide out from above the tree. Amos Slade was looking for Tod, Copper, and Vixey, alright, yet he had a bad habit of shooting any animal that moved like his confrontation with Tod when he was just a kit. All of a sudden, he spied the porcupine and his kits, but did not shoot. When he spotted the fox couple and his hound dog, he shot at them, causing the trio to change direction. They skidded to their separate ways. He was hot on Vixey's heels, but did not shoot her- just followed her, hoping she would be on her way to the bear's den. The vixen veered toward the opposite path. Amos had failed his boss. In a timely manner, the bear imminently emerged in between the trees. \"Did you apprehend her?\" he asked. \"I tried. I really did, but she was too fast!\" Amos explained. At this, the bear made a sound of distrust. \"You betrayed my trust in you, Mr. Slade!\" he snarled accusingly. That was the moment when Amos turned against him. \"I NEVER wanted to let you hurt her, let alone that other fox, and my hound dog!\" \"Very well,\" the bear said, coolly as he gripped onto Amos' shirt, \"I'll set up an army against you, those foxes, and your pet.\" Then, the bear set Amos back down onto the forest floor and set off back to his lair to think of his diabolical, criminal plan, while the regretful hunter embarked on searching for Tod, Vixey, and Copper because he owed them a apology- big time! However, all he received was their growls when he tried to atone with them. \"Listen, I'm sorry. I had no other choice because the bear would have killed me if I hadn't tried to get ahold of you.\" \"Well, you should of thought of that before you gave in to that wicked creature,\" they seemed to say. \"Okay! Okay! Let's get to the point: He is now arranging his army by force!\" It worked! The three had stopped growling for they were finally convinced. All Amos Slade, Tod, Vixey, and Copper had to do was implement an idea that would outdo the bear and his posse.[Chapter 5] Back in the present, Amos finally decided, \"I know. How about we get your kits and your other animal friends? That would work, right?\" Tod, Vixey, and Copper considered this until they nodded in agreement. Without a moment to lose, they darted through the open in a hurry. … Meanwhile, the porcupine was about to take the fox kits home until their parents, Copper, and his owner came home to warn them. \"Listen, everyone!\" Amos pleaded, \"The bear has come to take over the forest and attack us by force with his evil army.\" \"Mom, he tried to kill us!\" Rascal stated, referring to Amos Slade. \"He tried to kill us, too, but he's with us now,\" Vixey assured, nuzzling his nose. \"Now, who's with me?\" Amos asked, then put one hand forward until extra hands piled onto his and raised their hands an inch in approval. … Later on, the bear reappeared with the Red Bull, a sewer rat named Ratigan and his assembly and they were bad to the bone. Without thinking clearly, Amos shot the Red Bull, but the bullet melted because the bull was flaring up and seething like fire. The hunter hurdled downward in case the bullet returned to hit him. He won the battle, but lost the war. Just when the Red Bull was ready to attack once more, Tod, Vixey, and their kits intervened by splashing pond water in his face and boy, did he not like water! The moment the Red Bull was about to reach them, they leapt out of his way. In the water, he dissolved. Yet, the forest creatures' and Amos' troubles weren't over. Ratigan and his crew were about to lunge on Copper, but he batted them all away. Up on the tree, Big Mama, Dinky, and Boomer tossed sticks, landing directly on the rat and his minions. \"OW!\" Ratigan and his minions shouted, but that didn't stop them from trying to pounce on Rascal. Before they can go for him, he swatted them with his tail, and they hovered onto the porcupine. The rats squealed in agony and ran away. \"That's our Rascal,\" Vixey praised. \"That's our son, alright,\" Tod encouraged. Rascal smiled. The bear roared, \"I have to do everything myself!\" When he was close to getting a hold of Amos, the kits blocked the animal's way and lunged onto him and bit him. Tod laughed proudly, \"That's our kids.\" \"Oh, Tod,\" Vixey said, also very impressed. One kit climbed the tree and just as the bear tried to finish him off, a brown figure approached. \"Leave him alone, you monster!\" Big Mama yelled. She pulled on his fur with her talons. \"Boomer, Big Mama might need our help,\" Dinky said. \"Oh, she might,\" Boomer agreed and they loomed over toward the giant figure. \"Take that, you nasty bear!\" Dinky shrieked and pulled onto one ear, using his talons. \"Take this you filthy animal!\" Boomer shouted and pecked the bear in the face. The bear roared in rage and he struck Boomer unconscious. \"Boomer!\" Dinky cried and soared towards the motionless woodpecker. \"Boomer, my dear friend,\" Dinky sniffed. \"Boomer, honey,\" Big Mama said sadly. Vixey ran to defend her friend that got knocked out. \"Careful, Vixey!\" Tod shouted after her. \"Don't worry, Tod,\" she said, \"I've seen you and your friend do it before and I'll do just that for you, the kits, and everyone else.\" \"That's my Vixey,\" Tod said, finally feeling confident. Vixey pinned down the bear and bit the bear pretty hard and when the bear was about to kiss her, she spit in his face, causing the bear to wipe his face, while Big Mama and Dinky nudged Boomer slightly. It succeeded! Boomer woke up. \"Boomer, you're back!\" Dinky exclaimed gleefully. \"What happened?\" Boomer moaned. \"The bear hit you,\" Big Mama replied and helped the woodpecker back onto his feet. Boomer dusted himself off and said, fixing his beak, \"Oh shucks! I think the bear b-b-b-bent my b-beak!\" While all of this was going on, Vixey found a way to trick the bear. She just had to lure him back to his den. \"Oh, bear!\" she called in a sultry voice to get his attention, \"You said you want to have me as your mate, but it's not going to happen.\" Feeling proud of herself, Vixey took off running. The rest of the party followed in case she needed their support. As soon as they made it to the bear's territory, Vixey stopped out of his way, pretending to be injured. In that moment, the bear was about to enter home, but only fell silently to his watery grave. The ugly bear was finally finished for good. AN: For the bear's men, I was originally going to have Mr. Digger, the mean badger who scolded Tod for destroying his house twice, instead, I used the Red Bull from The Last Unicorn , which belongs to Lionsgate, while Ratigan and his group from The Great Mouse Detective are owned by Disney.[Chapter 6] Soon after the battle was over, the hunter escorted the fox family, his dog, the three birds, including Boomer, who can still fly despite the powerful swipe the bear set upon him, and the porcupine proceeded over by Widow Tweed's to tell her everything that happened: \"The bear that attacked me, my dog, and your fox wanted me to do away with them. So, I had no other choice but to follow his orders.\" \"Is that so?\" she asked, skeptically. \"Widow, it may sound crazy, but it's all true.\" Widow Tweed shook her head in shock. Tod gave her the \"he's right\" look and Amos went on, \"But then I decided to quit after chasing the foxes and my dog away. I didn't really want to kill them. That was when I tried to apologize, but they growled at me until I found a way to stop the bear and his army.\" \"And what way was that?\" \"I used them on my side. First, I shot the red bull that burns like fire. The bullet in him melted. That was the moment the foxes saved me by splashing him and the rats tried to hurt my dog and the foxes, but these birds threw twigs at the rats and the one fox kit hit them with his tail, which caused them to land sharply on the porcupine. \"Then, the kits bit the bear the same way my dog and that fox of yours did,\" Amos continued, \"Next, the birds and that other fox came to their rescue and that vixen tricked the bear into him going back to his den. At that time, he fell all the way down the waterfall and never came back.\" \"Thank you for sharing, Amos Slade,\" said Widow Tweed and she clapped with the entourages. Amos Slade took a bow. \"Thanks for listening.\" To his credit, not only did he risk his life for the wild animals and his dog, he told the truth in his speech. Dinky and Boomer rested on Mrs. Tweed's shoulder. \"Oh, I remember you,\" she said, eyeing the gold finch. Dinky grinned. \"And I recognize you, too,\" she said, turning her head to the owl, who emitted a smile, and to the woodpecker, she went on, \"But I don't know you.\" Boomer was momentarily alarmed by the old woman's comment and he remembered a time when she opened to door when he wasn't looking. \"I'd like to, though,\" Mrs. Tweed returned. Now, Boomer was smirking and glided over to get her a flower. \"Is that for me?\" Mrs. Tweed asked him. Boomer nodded. \"Thank you,\" she said and patted him on the head. Just then, six little kits frolicked towards the lady. \"Oh, look at you, you've grown into the playful kits I know since the last time I saw you,\" Mrs. Tweed declared, petting them. Day after day, a new chapter in the kits' life started little by little, such as bonding and walking with their parents, traveling with their uncle, Copper, and playing. \"Look, kids!\" Boomer shouted, \"It's our friend, Squeaks!\" \"Yeah, we've known him for quite a while,\" Dinky remarked. For the fun of it, the kits playfully chased Squeaks, who is now a butterfly. From that day forward, the foxes, birds, hounds, the porcupine, the hunter, and the old lady were a happy family.

First off thanks for reading this, but I should let you know, I am not particularly sure I want to start this story. I just figured I put at least a couple chapters up to get this idea out of my head. It's been rattling like crazy for a while now. Any who, this is my addition to it and I hope you enjoy it. Please read and review as always. P.S. I don't own any of the contents of Warrior, just the stuff you don't recognize are mine =) Pittsburgh. He never thought he would ever come back to this city, especially with all that happened here to him growing up. But here he was, walking the old stomping grounds, in the middle of the night no less. Not much had changed in this part of town, then again nothing ever did around these parts. Same local food joints, buildings, apartments and homes, same streets with a stillness that over took the neighborhood when it snowed. Made a graveyard jealous. But to Tommy, this was all new. It confused him greatly as he walked down his childhood street, freshly off a city bus. He never knew this place to be silent. His parents screaming always filled his ears growing up. The noise was always terrible and it made it hard to think about anything else. His mother's screams were always bad but what made it worse was the guilt he always felt for not doing anything about it. \"It's alright, tiger. Everything will be alright...\" That was a lie, a big fat lie. Everything was never alright. In fact it got worse. When he and his mom left, they were betrayed and left to fend for themselves. He was just a kid, his big brother was supposed to come for him, but he never did. He chose the girl. Tommy didn't have that luxury. Tommy got to bury people. But that all happened nearly fourteen years ago. He had grown since then. He was a man now, a man coming back to his roots in a way. He wasn't sure why, but he felt like walking his old neighborhood. Even got to pass the old high school he won so many matches at. He smirked, remembering each and everyone of them Because she made them memorable. She never missed a match. \"Get em, T! Tigers go for the kill!\" But that was a lifetime ago. Now, he was no tiger, not anymore Movement ahead of him caught his attention. A small figure, a lady he figured, telling by the white skirt and black heeled boots she was wearing, was coming towards him. She wore a dark colored hoodie with it's hood up, blocking his view of her face. She had long dark hair that was spilling from it, down to her hip and to the small duffle bag slung over one of her shoulders. The word STEELERS was written in bold yellow lettering on the side of it, making him blink at the sight. it wasn't uncommon for people to show their support of the football team, after all they were in Pittsburgh. So it wasn't surprising. But what caught him was her eyes. As she lifted her head to stare off at the apartment complex on his right, he saw the woman's eyes. She passed him by, completely unaware of him and turned to the house on his left, apartment 915 was staring back at him. She climbed the steps and instantly a dog began to bark on the other side of the door. \"Easy Ace, Imma coming.\" She laughed, digging for her keys in her hoodie pocket. Tommy stopped, frowning before turning to 915. \"Sammi...\" Samina Forge, or simply known as Sammi, turned around and looked at the man standing at the foot of her stoop. Her eyes grew wide at the sight. \"Tommy... Hey...\" Tommy smirked, coming to stand at the first step of the stoop. Sammi came down a couple steps staring in disbelief at him. She was speechless. \"How you been?\" Tommy nodded. \"Alright...You look good.\" \"You too...\" They fell silent all of a sudden, not knowing what else to say to one another. A barking dog could be heard from the other side of her door again, shaking Sammi out of her thoughts. \"You wanna come inside for a bit? It's pretty chilli out here.\" Tommy thought about it. He was heading to his house, but meeting him was a worse choice than meeting up with Sammi. Besides he was getting cold. \"I'm gonna make some dinner... well maybe more of a midnight snack considering what time it is.\" Sammi said with a crooked smile. She knew Tommy was the silent type. He never said too much to begin with, it was why she had to say something to egg him on. Otherwise they would be going no where. Besides, she knew he loved food, no matter the time difference. Tommy to her was always the same. \"Unless you have somewhere else to be. I understand if you do.\" \"Nah, food sound good right about now.\" Tommy replied, climbing up the stairs to meet her. Sammi smiled fully, watching him come to her. He had grown exponentially since the last time she saw him. He had a complete wrestlers build growing up, but now he was a man, he was built like something else, something she was happy to see. Wide developed shoulders filled out his two layers of jackets well. His shoulders big and stiff as he moved. He had a duffle bag too, just bigger. She laughed when their eyes met. \"Come here...\" she gestured for him to come closer. Tommy knew that smile and obliged slowly, stopping a step from her. Sammi shook her head and wrapper her arms around him, hugging him tightly. She inhaled his scent, it bringing back memories she had buried long ago. She squeezed her eyes shut when she felt his arm reluctantly hug her back. \"I am so sorry to hear about your mom.\" She whispered in his ear. She felt him nod against her head. She rubbed his back and upper shoulders before pulling away from him, staring at his eyes. She smiled sadly at him. \"How are you holding up?\" \"I'm okay, I've had time to cope.\" he replied calmly. Sammi's eyes narrowed \"You were always a horrible liar.\" That brought his smile back, making her chuckle along with it. The dog was barking again. \"Jeez, lets get inside before he wakes the neighborhood up.\" Sammi let him go, turning to her front door and unlocking it. As soon as she opened the door, a large black Doberman came barking and wagging it's tail. Sammi chuckled the canine, petting it's head rigorously. \"Yeah, yeah, I'm home. Sorry about the wait, babe.\" she said to it. She turned to look at Tommy over her shoulder. \"Come on in. He won't bite, unless I ask him to.\" she laughed walking in. Tommy stared at the dog, watching it follow his owner. He came inside and shut the front door behind him. The lights turned on, revealing a small living room with a long sofa to his right up against the far wall and the a small kitchen to his left, fit with a small dinning table with two seats. A bedroom door was in the living room diagonal from him. It was small but cozy. \"Make yourself at home,\" Sammi said, shedding off her hoodie and bag. \"I'm gonna feed him real quick, then I'll get started on our food. Mac n Cheese sound good?\" Tommy nodded at her. She went off to the kitchen, the dog still with her. \"That's a big dog.\" Sammi smiled at him. \"Yeah I know, I didn't think he was gonna get this big. He was actually the runt of the litter.\" Tommy came into the kitchen, setting his bag on the table before crossing his arms over his chest. He stared at the dog, seeing the large hound was in defensive mode. \"Oh yeah, Ace this is Tommy... Tommy this is Ace, my protector of sorts.\" Sammi laughed. She poured the dog it's food, gaining his attention. His tail wagged happily as he had new water and food to occupy him. \"He's really protective, but he's a sweetheart. Just like someone else I know.\" Tommy's gaze went to her eyes, noticing the cheekiness radiating out of them. Sammi's blue eyes were easy to look at, like deep oceans he would drown in if he kept staring. He forgot how mesmerizing they were, especially when they had that mischievous glint in them, a glint she only showed to him. Sammi sighed, shaking her head. She went over to the fridge and started working on their meals. Fifteen minutes later, they had homemade mac n' cheese waiting for them to devour. Tommy stomach growled from the smell of it alone. Sammi poured them a bowl each and headed to the table where he had take a seat. He stood up and removed his bag from the table, setting it on the floor off by the wall behind him. Sammi took her seat opposite him but rose quickly forgetting something. \"Forgot drinks... what would you like?\" \"A beer would be fine.\" \"Sorry, I don't drink... but if you want I'll run to the corner liquor store real quick to grab you a case?\" Tommy shook his head. \"Bad idea, especially this late. It's fine, I'll have something else.\" \"Glass of milk?\" She laughed, feeling bad she didn't have what he wanted. Tomorrow after work she would pick him up a case. Tommy nodded. \"Go ahead and eat, don't feel the need to wait for me.\" Tommy ignored her, waiting patiently for her to join him. His mother taught him to be respectful and after all these years, with all the things he had been through, he would do his mother proud by standing by her teachings. Besides he didn't have to wait long, Sammi was setting his glass of milk in front of him before taking her seat. Ace had finished his meal and came to sit next to his owner, content with his own meal. \"Hope you like it, I kind of made it in a hurry.\" \"I'm sure it's fine.\" he said picking at his food before taking a bite. It was still hot but it was good. Tommy had forgotten how good a cook Sammi was. She, like their mothers, believed in making everything homemade. They were all old fashioned that way. It was what Tommy had grown up on and what he preferred. Nothing was better than a home cooked meal. Sammi on the other hand kept an eye on Tommy, noticing he was starving, not like he usually did, but like he hadn't eaten in a while, like a couple of days while. He was scarfing his food down like he wasn't sure when he would eat next, like he was homeless or something. It would explain why he was here in Pittsburgh and why he was here in their old neighborhood. But she didn't ask him about any of it. If he was in trouble she would help him without asking twenty-one questions. She knew he wasn't the sharing type anyways. He would never admit he was in trouble. He had finished his first bowl in a matter of two minutes, surprising Sammi for a moment. She then remembered he had quite an appetite on him. \"If you want more, there's plenty in the pan.\" she reached over, waiting for him to hand her his bowl but he shook his head, standing instead. \"I can get it, you eat.\" Her shoulders slumped watching him head to the stove to pour himself another bowl. She began eating her food, not noticing how hungry she was as well. She hadn't eating since three this afternoon, when she took her lunch break, if you could even call it that. She needed to bring on more people aboard her team, that way she wasn't always covering everyone's breaks without taking one herself. Suddenly Tommy was staring at her, as if he was waiting for something. Sammi's eyes grew wide staring back at him. \"I'm sorry, did you say something?\" \"I said, where do you work so late that you come home at this hour?\" \"Oh,\" she laughed, shaking her head. \"You remembered Fitzy's old gym?\" \"The one we used to go to?\" \"Yeah, that one. Well I own it now.\" She smiled brightly. \"Really? How'd you manage that one?\" \"The old geezer past away a couple years back and his granddaughter, Beatrice I think, was selling it dirt cheap.\" Sam said, taking the last of her food in her mouth. \"Didn't have the heart to see it go, considering how much time I used to spend there.\" \"Man, that's really great.\" Tommy nodded. \"But doesn't explain the long hours. You guys close at what midnight?\" Sammi chuckled, shaking her head. \"No, we close at eleven. I was there after hours to clean and things, set up for tomorrow and what not.\" \"You have no help?\" \"Nah, I have help, I just sent him home, considering I knew how late it was getting. I wasn't about to ask Fenroy to stay just cause I feel the gym needed cleaning\" Tommy nodded again. \"You can be a neat freak sometimes.\" Sammi gaped at him. \"Oh hush, my bad for believing in hygiene.\" Tommy smiled at her, shaking his head. He sat back in his chair, looking into the living room. Above the dark grey couch, sat a painting of a snowy mountain range. There was a TV near the wall by the door. There was also a small stereo under the front window next to it. It was simple and neat. Sammi got up, cleaning up the table quickly before heading to the kitchen sink. She placed them in, turning on the faucet to fill one side of the double sink. She shut the water off to grab the pan she cooked everything in. There was nothing left, not surprising her. She smiled and set it too in the water. \"I didn't even think to ask you if you still wanted some.\" Tommy said standing up quickly from his seat. \"Oh no, don't worry about it. I had enough, believe me.\" Tommy didn't, not one bit. He knew Sammi was a modest person, reserved most of the time she was around people. She would never say if she wanted something, gladly giving her share to others if necessary. She reminded him of a mother that way. \"Tommy seriously,\" Sammi smiled, catching the look of Tommy's face. \"I'm full as it is\" She didn't give him room to argue about it, simply letting it go. He nodded, heading over to her slowly. He felt he needed to do something, help her clean up or something, anything to keep himself busy. He didn't understand why he was so nervous now. It was only Sammi. Sammi picked up on his nervousness, smiling at the dishes she was washing. Tommy was only nervous when he had things on his mind. Usually that meant heavy things were on his mind, majority of the time he let things roll over his shoulders, the major things he kept bottled up inside. When he felt like sharing, she would listen, but not before. \"If you want, you can go sit down. I'm almost done anyways.\" Tommy stared at the back of her head, nodding more to himself than her. She couldn't see him anyways. He made his way to the couch, staring around the small living room. A glass cabinet sitting between the wall and the couch on his left caught his attention. There were things on displayed in there. He came to stand in front of it, staring at the items. Trophies off all kinds were staring back at him, scattered over three shelves, layered over each other. The top shelves were from earlier awards, things Sammi had won over her elementary years. There was also things of her family on display with it. Her parents wedding picture stood out the most. Her father was brown haired with grey eyes. He looked like he meant business, but Tommy knew him as a caring man who loved his family above all. His wife, Sammi's mother was a spitting image of Sammi. Older but just as beautiful as ever. She had black green eyes with black hair, like her only daughter. Tommy laughed at the next picture that his eyes fell on to. A family portrait. Sammi and her mother were seated in two chairs facing the camera while her father and three older brothers stood behind the two ladies. Yeah, Sammy was the youngest of four children, all boys before her. It was why she had such a charming personality. \"How's the family?\" Tommy called over to the kitchen. \"...Wouldn't know.\" Came Sammi's reply. Tommy instantly glanced back at her, noticing she had finished with the dishes. A small smile was on her lips as she came to stand next to him. \"Something happen?\" \"You could say that, but it's alright. It happened a long time ago now and well quite frankly I don't want to talk about it.\" She shrugged with a smile. She was relieved when Tommy didn't push the matter. She knew him to be quite pressing when he wanted her to tell him something. \"I'll be right back.\" She smiled heading to the bedroom. She turned the light on and began uncovering the bed, quickly stripping the sheets and pillow cases before changing them into new ones. She placed a new blanket on the bed before drapping her comforter on top of it. She folded the top covers in half, towards the end of the bed before grabbing two towels from her closet and placing them on the corner of the bed. She quickly grabbed her night clothes and the cloths she would wear the next day before going into her bathroom and getting her toothbrush. She could brush her teeth in the sink anyways. She met Tommy in the living room. He had sat down on the couch, petting Ace who had sat down on the couch next to him. Sammi couldn't help the smile growing on her face. It was a sight she could get used to. Tommy turned his attention to her, frowning when his eye fell to her things in her hands. He stopped petting the Doberman and stood up, coming closer to her. Sammi smirked at him and shook her head, walking towards the kitchen table. She set her clothes and things on it before turning to the man. \"You take the bed.\" Tommy shook his head. \"Nah, that wouldn't be right. I'm fine on the couch.\" \"Tommy, I hardly sleep and I have an early start in the morning, like an hour before the sunrise, early.\" she smiled at him. \"It's alright, you take the bed. I already changed everything for you and set new towels out. You need anything else?\" \"Sammi, I...\" \"You know better than to argue with me, T. Take the bed, I don't mind the couch, I fit on it, you probably don't\" Tommy sighed heavily, slightly smiling. It felt nice to be in familiar waters again. For so long he was out in a fog, not knowing where he was or who to trust anymore. Sammi was like a beacon that he gladly welcomed. She was always the light he needed, even though he never deserved it. She was the wall his back hit when all else failed. She would never let him fall past her and for that he was completely grateful. He just never showed it. He never knew how, but Sammi never seemed to mind. Deep down, he knew he couldn't always let her, he would have to do something to repay her one day. That he promised himself a long time ago. But for now, he would welcome her bed with open arms. The traveling and the two plates of comfort food didn't help his exhaustion. And Sammi could tell Tommy was tired. He was fading slowly. She smiled and came closer to him, placing a hand gently one of his massive shoulders. Tommy was always taller than her, but he had grown even more so since the last time she saw him. It could be because he filled out width wise too, but she didn't really care. Sammi was just happy to see him again. After he left with his mom, she wasn't sure she would. But Tommy was back. Her tiger had returned.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Sleeping on the couch was a bad idea. Her body was screaming as soon as she regained consciousness. Muscles were sore and bones aching. Old injuries were eating at her nerves, her back and knee in particular. She might need her medicine today it seemed. She had put it off for two weeks so far, a new record for her. She hated taking it thought. It helped relieve the pain but it would always make her mind foggy. It made doing normal activities a bother. Everything was harder to accomplish with the meds. She would put it off until it was absolutely needed, just like she normally did. Sammi took a breath, stretching herself as she lay on the sofa. A few bones popped in her spine, sending a dull pain through her abdomen. Ace had set himself underneath her coffee table, his head near her fallen hand. He never left her side when she slept, her great protector. She cranked her neck to look at him, happy to see that he was still asleep. Usually the dog was up and running about her small apartment at this time. She was grateful for his slumber. Today he decided to sleep in. He did have a late dinner after all. Dinner. It had been such a long time since Sammi had someone over for dinner, years actually now that she thought about it. Even her aunt Olivia hadn't come over in a while. It wasn't that Olivia didn't want to come over, it was merely the fact Sammi always came over to her place instead. Olivia never minded, but Sammi could tell she was worried. She was always worried about her niece. With everything that had happened some years ago, she had a right to be. Sammi was the only family she had around her now. Same could be said for Sammi. She was grateful for her aunt. She loved her with everything she had. But now there was Tommy. She cranked her head up to see her bedroom door above her. The light was off and the door shut. He was still asleep by the looks of it. Good, it looks like he didn't leave after all . She had honestly expected him to try and sneak out after the lights were off. He was good at doing that. The many nights he spent with her when his parents fought, usually ended up with him leaving before she woke the next day. She would just see him at school a couple hours later. Tommy did have a tendency of thinking he was a burden on others. That was never the case though, not with her, and certainly not his family. So she didn't know where he got the ridiculous idea from. Tommy always kept to himself growing up. He always held everything he felt inside himself. She used to tell him that he would pop if she didn't let it out sometimes. She used to say that she would pick up his pieced, that it would be his fault if he blew up but that was a lie. Sammi was always there for Tommy. Always. Even when he didn't want her around. She ignored him most of the time when he was like that. He was always so incredible stubborn and sometimes she wanted to hit him upside the head. And sometimes she did. He always stared at her for a second before smirking at her. She always gave him that look. He knew what that meant. Sammi sighed and stared out her curtain covered window. It was still dark out, the sun's rays barely making their way up into the sky. That was the worst part of working and owning the gym. She had to be up before dawn, at least an hour before. It was two in her case, only because she liked her morning workout, a routine she had since grade school, the days when there was no such thing as responsibility. Besides, coming from a family of marines, it was normal for everyone to be up at this hour. The sudden opening of the bedroom door shook her from her thoughts. Sammi instantly turned her head to see Tommy in a tank top and grey sweat pants walking through the open door. She frowned at him when they made eye contact with one another. \"What's wrong?\" she asked, instantly rising from her couch. She ignored the pangs in her body as she gazed at her house guest. \"Nah, it's nothing. Just want something to eat if that's cool.\" Tommy said, rubbing an eye. She laughed, shaking her head at him. \"Something's never change, I see.\" She stood up, arching her back as she stretched. Tommy watched her through the dim light in the living room. She was a lot smaller than he remembered her to be. She had grown into a woman no doubt, but she was smaller somehow. It made him frown. \"What?\" Sammi asked catching his looking. \"Uh, nothing.\" he responded quickly. She laughed again. \"Nothing is something.\" \"You okay?\" It was her turn to frown. \"Yeah, why?\" \"You look different.\" \"We haven't seen each other for what, fifteen years now? Things change in that time.\" \"Fourteen, but that's not what I meant.\" Tommy shook his head. He walked off towards her kitchen, instantly opening the fridge. He pulled out some bread and other things for a sandwich before coming to the table and setting them there. Sammi came to stand on the other side of the small table, smiling as he made his food. \"T, I know what you meant.\" She sighed. How was it that a man who never said much could speak volumes with just his eyes? He always got what he wanted out of her, without even saying a word. She didn't share much about herself, but with Tommy Conlon those rules flew out the window. She used to silently curse him for it, but like always, her anger never lasted long with him. He would only have to show her that crooked smirk of his and everything would be fine. \"I stopped doing gymnastics a while ago.\" he stopped buttering his bread to look up at her. He was obviously shocked by it. Sammi was a gymnast since before they had met. Since she was three years old to be exact. She loved doing back flips and cartwheels up and down the streets. Where ever she found an open areas for her to practice in, she was there. The wrestling mat was a prime example. After practice he would catch her on it, flipping and rolling about. She was a natural and she put everything she had into her sport. She was the best he had ever seen and she had won countless trophies for her skill. It was her passion and her dream to be in the Olympics one day. So why she would stop all of a sudden. \"You were headed to regional when I left, what happened? You didn't make it?\" She shook her head. That was one way of putting it. \"No, never did.\" Tommy frowned. \"The judges were always bastards.\" Sammi laughed at his expression as he continued to make his sandwich. That was the truth put lightly. The judges in Gymnastics were always the toughest to win over, everyone knew that. There were countless times she, her coaches, her parents as well as Tommy would throw fits at the calls they made. It was always something stupid too. They marked down for hair, or leotard or whatever they saw fit. It was a bias competition but she loved it. She checked the time, seeing it was already half past five. Her eyes grew. She had no idea that it was that late already. She wasn't going to have enough time for a good workout today. She groaned and spun around, darting to the bedroom. She hurried to the shower and get over her with her normal morning routine. She was out of her room in a matter of ten minutes, dressed in simple black leggings with a matching tank top she scurried out into the kitchen. Ace still needed to be fed and her morning coffee needed to be made. But Tommy had already beaten her to it. He was pouring her cup as she stared at him in the kitchen. Ace was happily eating away at his breakfast. That dog would need a run today since he had eaten twice with no exercise. She smiled at how quickly his tail was wagging, but it made her gleeful at how well her two boys were getting along with one another. She laughed out loud at the thought. Tommy hadn't been home for twenty four hours and she was already calling him her man again. When did that happen? She stared at him as he stood in her small kitchen. He had tattoos covering his arms, different pieces of work littered his skin. He also had one on his right peck, she had seen it earlier. She always pictured him with tattoos growing up, knowing he had an eye for them and would eventually get them. But his size was what intrigued her. He was muscular. Not cut like a body builder but hard and defined through hard knew the type and it made her smile. Like her, he had always been an athlete, wrestling his forte. Growing up he had a lean build, the build of a grappler. Long legs and arms was his how his body had been for years. that was no longer the case. Tommy now had the body of a man, it evident from how developed his shoulders were. They were hard to break away from. Feeling her eyes on him, Tommy turned to see Sammi leaning back against the kitchen counter behind him, her bare arms crossed casually over her chest. She was smiling at him warmly, her eyes twinkling like they usually did for a reason he still didn't know. He thought over time he would understand women a bit more but he was still as confused as the day he met Samina. He wondered if she would still give affection like she used to, weather it be a kiss on the cheek or a hug from behind. She was giving him that look again. \"Made you some coffee.\" \"Thank you, you didn't have to.\" she said coming to stand next to him. He could smell the shampoo from her damp hair. \"I think it's fair, since you made dinner last night.\" Tommy responded, sliding over her coffee. He even poured it in her favorite mug, her black Steelers one. This guy... She stared into the dark liquid as they fell into silence, Ace drinking his water the only noise they could hear. He was a loud drinker. \"You barely slept last night.\" \"Ah, couple hours is what I usually have. Besides, tomorrow is my day off, I'll sleep in then.\" She smiled. Her eyes found his when a thought popped into her head. \"Since you're up and all, wanna come to work with me?\" She grinned. It faded when he looked away from her. \"But if you have something else to do, I get it.\" Tommy did have something else to do. He needed to see his dad. He didn't want to but that's where he was headed last night before he ran into her. Paddy Conlon. Tommy wanted nothing to do with the old vet. After everything the man did to his family, did to his mother, he would never forgive him. They had travel so far from Pittsburgh, even going north once they hit the pacific. His mom couldn't put enough distance between them and his father, even though she loved him with everything she had. She just couldn't take it anymore, taking the punches and the screaming Paddy's alcohol brought on. And for that, Tommy would never forgive him. Him and Brendan. Sammi could see the change in Tommy's shoulders, the tension that resided in his muscles. He was thinking of the past. She knew of his parents fights, she thanked her parents everyday that they never fought like that. She thanked her brothers for never letting her down like Tommy's had. She had seen the pain in his eyes when he told her that Brendan wasn't coming, the betrayal in them made her cry. Tommy needed his big brother, but he chose to stay. Stay because of a girl. in all honesty, she didn't blame Brendan, she knew he was in love with Tess. They got married and have two adorable little girls now. They looked like their mother, but they had their Ms. Conlon's eyes. A piece of his mother always stayed with Brendan after all. \"How bout I meet you there.\" She smirked, nodding. \"Yeah that's fine. I better get going though. If I don't get at least some sort of a workout in, it would be a very long day for me, not to mention the people I work around. Last thing I need is to murder my gym.\" she turned around and grabbed her bag, the same one from last night. She darted off towards her room again, grabbing a change of clothing. her medication was on the dresser, staring right back at her. Not today... She practically ran out of the room upon seeing that it was six on the spot. She hopped on one leg as she put on her shoes. Tommy was still in the kitchen, leaning on the counter top as he stare at her. He had a frown on his brow when their eyes met. \"You're not gonna eat?\" \"Nah, I don't have time right now, T.\" she said grabbing an over sized shirt out of her bag. She scurried back into the kitchen, quickly drinking her black coffee. Not the way she liked it, but she didn't have time to be fussy, she just needed to the caffeine anyways. She dumped her mug in the steel sink before turning to Ace. Her doberman had an anxious look in his dark eyes. He wanted out. She laughed at him, kissing his the top of his furry head. \"You wanna come with me today?\" She asked him. \"No biting though.\" Ace barked silently, obviously knowing what she meant. She nodded and turned to Tommy smiling. She leaned over, standing on her toes to kiss his cheek. She barely missed his bottom lip, thanks to her last minute change of mind. She had to control her self. It was a little too easy to get back into their groove once more. But things had changed. Tommy and Sammi had changed since they met last. Life didn't stop for either of them and it sure wasn't stop now. \"Bye Tiger.\" She whispered before darting out the apartment. Sam had enough time for a quick workout, thankfully. She stretched and did basic workouts mostly, pushups, pullups and crunches was all the time and her body would allow. She had run here which made Ace happy. Her sleeping on the couch had stiffened her body more than she would have liked. But now she was loose and ready for the day ahead. Upon entering her gym, she stared at the vastness of it. It had changed since she bought it. New paint, new equipment and even some renovations. She added a gymnastics room in the back where she taught kids and her self defense classes. She had conjoined them with a single set of double doors. It was more efficient that way. The front room, this room was the place where majority of the men took over anyway, kids and woman alike weren't exactly comfortable with their workouts especially with how it was now. Growing up it had been boxing and wrestling. But all practice in the Mixed Martial Arts now. The leading fighter was none other than Pete 'Mad Dog' Grimes, number one contender in the world for the middleweight belt. Because he trained at her gym, he had to pay rent, him as his manager Colt Boyd. She smiled as she turned the lights on. Rent was due today. When six-forty-five hit, Fenroy was standing at the door, banging on the glass. Standing at five-foot-eleven, Fenroy, or Roy as she called him was her one and only employee here. Not many were needed to run this place, thankfully. He was a great employee anyways. She didn't need anyone else. He was of Korean decent, born and raised here in Pittsburgh like her. He was an up and coming fighter too but he lacked one thing she was glad he didn't have, an ego. She sighed as she stared at him through her open door. Her office on the left side of the front desk, allowed her to see who came through the front. She smirked from her chair and walked over to the front door. She nodded to him when he came through. They would be open in fifteen minutes. \"Mornin boss.\" \"Good morning, Roy.\" She replied, locking the door again. She watched him set his workout bag on the front desk. He rubbed his hands together vigorously, obviously trying to warm them. \"It's not that cold.\" she teased. \"Yeah it is. I had to walk here today.\" \"Oh no, what a nightmare.\" He stared at her, his brown eyes growing wide. \"Sorry, forgot you don't drive.\" She shook her head at him as she walked by. Passing through the gym she turned on the air conditioning. Though it was chili outside, it would be a furnace in here once people were in here. Not to mention smelly. Too bad there were no windows that opened in here. That would have helped. Perhaps she would get some when the next renovation happened. Definitely something to think about. It was one in the afternoon when Tommy came by. He had a smirk on his lips as he came through the front door. She had changed the name of the gym, calling it 'The Forge'. Sammi was such a goof sometimes. Fenroy was sitting in front of a laptop as he undid the bindings of his hands. He had gotten in a workout earlier because it had been slow. People usually flooded in after lunch and then again at rush hour. He had time and Sammi had let him. She was a pretty flexible boss and let him do things when it was slow. It was better than his old job, where he had to clean toilets non stop. \"Hey man,\" the young man greeted. Tommy nodded. He was checking out the area behind the desk man. The gym had changed a lot since the last time he been here. Sammi did a great job with the place. There was never this man people here at one time when they were younger. Fitzy would be proud. \"So uh, how's this work?\" Fenroy instantly grabbed a short card and a small pencil before slapping it in front of Tommy on the desk. \"Get a locker for thirty-five bucks a month. We open at seven, lights out at eleven. If you're interested, put your name and info on the card and then sign the waiver.\" Tommy nodded. He didn't know if he wanted to join the gym but since Sammi worked and owned the place, why not. He grabbed the card and pencil and walked off towards the side where the posters were pinned up. The first thing that met his eyes was the long poster of a fighter, 'Mad Dog\". He frowned at it. He didn't like the way the guy looked. He knew that look and most if not all the time, it was just that, a look. There was nothing behind the man's eyes, nothing but ego. He ignored it and began writing in the info card he had been given, putting it up against the poster wall. As he finished writing his information down, another poster caught his eye. 'Sparta was written in big bold yellow lettering, but beneath it was peaked his interest. It was a tournament and the purse was five million bucks. He froze at the number before reading into the poster. He could do that. That gave him a determination he hadn't had in a while. It made him smile. It had been decided. Tommy came back to the desk, handing his information and the waiver back to the young man. Again, just like before Tommy began scoping out the gym area behind Fenroy. His eye darted from one area to another. They fell onto a set of steel doors in the far back. \"You looking for someone?\" \"Yeah me,\" Sammi replied from her office door frame. She had on a long peach skirt, flowing to her bare feet and a white tank top on. Her hair was pulled up in to a high ponytail, it ending at the small of her back. She had changed and showered from her workout earlier. Though it wasn't an attire for a gym, it was an attire she was used to. She taught others, not worked out herself. She had the leniency to dress as such. She smiled and came forward. Both men turned to the young woman, smile on her lips. They had no idea how long she had been standing there. \"You okay?\" Tommy nodded quickly, staring between her and Fenroy. Fenroy was doing to same to him and his boss. \"Roy, this is Tommy... Tommy, Fenroy.\" She giggled as she introduced them to each other. She crossed her arms as they simply nodded at one another. Men... She stared at the card in front of Roy. \"He sign up.\" \"Yup just did, we just need the locker fee.\" \"Waive it.\" Fenroy turned her confused. \"He's an old friend.\" She smiled. Roy nodded. Sammi was the boss, she could do that if she wanted to. Besides, he wasn't one to complain about it. She did the same for him anyways. He just shrugged a shoulder and set his card in with the rest of the contacts. She turned to Tommy, raising an eyebrow at him. \"You sign a waiver?\" He nodded. \"Good, though I doubt you will need it. One can't be too careful.\" She smiled. \"Come on, I'll show you around.\" \"Hey Sammi, can I take my lunch soon?\" She turned to Roy and thought about it. \"Yeah, lemme give him a tour and then I'll be back to cover you.\" \"Sounds good, thanks.\" Sammi led Tommy through the gym, pointing out equipment, the locker room, the ring, things he would normally need when working out here. There were various places where he would feel right at home. Though the place was packed, it still had corners where he could work out in peace. His heart began to race with an excitement he hadn't felt in a while. Sammi noticed the look in his eyes as he took the place in. She smiled, happy that he looked pleased and ready to start his work out. When they were younger, she would always stay after her own practice to watch him train, either here or at school. He was entirely focused on his training that she never bothered him. His dad was always there too, but it never seemed to matter. She was there for Tommy. She wanted him to know she was there to support him, to help keep him going. But now things were different. They weren't in school. He wasn't wrestling for the goal anymore either. She had a gym to run and she wasn't gonna get the chance to watch him train or work out. A part of her was a little sad by that. The part of her that wanted to watch her man work out. She needed a cold shower. \"You did good.\" Tommy said after the tour. \"Thanks, I did what I could.\" She shrugged. \"Why don't you go on and start training, or working out, or whatever it is you do.\" Tommy smirked as he nodded. He was anxious about that. She patted his upper arm as she walked away from him. She still had to relieve Fenroy for his lunch. Speaking of which, she was starving. She decided to grab a bit from her small fridge in her office before letting him go. At least she had something to munch on while she covered for him. All she had in there was an apple. She needed to grocery shopping. She would do that tomorrow since it was her day off. She could do it after her appointment. \"All right you, go on. You got an hour, make it count.\" \"You bet, thanks boss. You want anything while I'm out?\" Sammi shook her head, lying. \"No thank you. I'll be fine. See ya Roy.\" He nodded and ran out the door. She shook her head and sat down in the seat Roy had once occupied. She leaned back and sighed. It was half past one now and she could feel her energy draining as she sat there silently. It was a bad idea for her to sit right now, considering she was running on fumes at the moment but her back was acting up today. She needed to relieve the pressure from it. Teaching defense classes in the morning was rigorous especially since they were practicing how to throw an opponent. She didn't get the option of not volunteering. She was the instructor anyways. \"Earth to Sammi... Come in Sammi... Sam!\" Sammi was startled out of her thoughts by someone yelling at her. She stared up at the man now standing in front of her on the opposite side of the desk holding a white plastic bag. She smiled. \"Sorry Jack, was caught up with something.\" \"You're always caught up with something. What happened to you last night, I thought you were gonna met me after work?\" \"Yeah, sorry about that too.\" She sighed. \"Damn, I was really tired last night, and...\" Sammi stopped mid sentence, thinking about her next words carefully. She couldn't tell Jack about Tommy just yet. How could she? Yeah, my ex-boyfriend, my first love is showed up and we reconnected in a way. Yeah, that sounded great. Especially to a guy she just stared dating after knowing him for a year. He was gonna think she was still hung up on Tommy. She shook her head, feeling a dull headache coming on with the situation. \"And what?\" Jack asked, watching her with confusion. \"And I... crashed on the couch, didn't even make it to bed. Like I said, dog tired.\" She lied, right through her teeth. Tommy what are you doing to me?[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 \"You do work long hours.\" Jack smirked. \"How bout after work? Oh wait, don't you have tomorrow off? Why not do something tomorrow?\" Damn... \"Sorry Jack, I can't. I have to do quite a heavy set of errands tomorrow. I also have a friend who just came back to town. I haven't seen him in fifteen years and I don't know how long he's staying. I want to catch up with him.\" That made him frown, his eyes narrowing at her. She smiled back. \"Is that okay?\" \"Well no, it's not actually. You blow me off every time I ask you out. Yet here's this friend, this guy friend , who you want to spend all your time with.\" Sammi frowned too. \"I'm not spending all my time with him, Jack. I told you I haven't seen him in nearly two decades. Besides I do have the right to see who I want to. We are not serious.\" Jack dropped the bag of take out on the desk in front of her, making a loud thud. Sammi glanced at it before looking up at him. \"I think you should leave, Jack.\" \"I would if I were you.\" Both Jack and Sammi turned to see Tommy standing at the gym entrance next to the office door. He was wiping the sweat off his neck as he glared hard at the the other man in front of the counter. He had heard the food slamming on the desk making him look over. Since Sammi was alone up there relieving Fenroy for his lunch, Tommy made it a point to keep an eye on her as he worked out. Though he knew she did this on the regular, he felt he still needed to watch her. When he noticed Jack, Tommy's work out ended. He immediately knew this man was bad news. And sure enough he proved it. \"Jack.\" Sammi called out. She didn't need a scene at the entrance of her gym. She knew Tommy's tone and what followed. This wasn't going to end well and she hoped Jack was smart enough to listen. But she also knew Jack. He was a pompous ass when it came to other men. Jack's lip curled into a snarl. \"Who the hell are you?\" She sighed. \"Jack, Tommy. Tommy, Jack.\" \"What, can't speak for yourself? Gotta have a woman to fight your battles for you, huh tough guy?\" Tommy simply stood there silently. This was typical. People always wanted to fight him. Sure, Tommy did too but not out of the ring. He wasn't a brute who looked for a fight. Sammi was here too. He didn't like to fight in front of her, even if this punk deserved a good one-two. He never wanted to show her that side of was never proud of that side. Though she had seen him fight before, he always apologized to her for his actions. It was part of him he hated because it was a part of him that belong to his father. \"Jack, I want you to leave!\" Jack's gaze went to her. There was fire in his eyes. He was looking for a fight now but she wasn't going to allow it. This was her job, her gym and no idiot was going to speak to her or Tommy like that here. \"Whatever you and I are Jack, is done. I don't ever want to see you here again. I'll call the cops if I see you otherwise. Now go!\" Sammi stood up and slammed her palms on the front desk. She knew she was being loud, but it would be the only way she would get the point across to Jack. He was thick headed, just like the day she met him... But she had to hand it to him. He kept whatever insult he was going to throw at her to himself. It helped that Tommy took a step forward, coming to stand next to the Sammi's desk. Tommy's glare was intense and it took everything she had not to smile at that moment. Jack growled and stormed off, leaving the food on the desk as he slammed the front doors wide open. She exhaled loudly as soon as he was out of sight, her head dropping forward as she leaned on the front desk. \"Who was that?\" \"Oh you know, the one of many assholes I seem to attract.\" She smirked with her eyes closed, shaking her head. \"That list include me?\" Her head popped up to stare back at him. \"You have never been an asshole, Tiger.\" \"If you say so.\" \"You think different?\" Tommy crossed his arms over his chest, his arms bulging in the process. Sammi's eyes instantly dropped to his arms, making her smile. He frowned back. \"What?\" She shook her head. \"You have never been an asshole, Tommy. I don't think it's possible for you to be one. I wouldn't have gone out with you if I thought you were.\" Tommy smirked back, nodding his head. His eyes traveled to the pile of food Jack left on the front desk. Mexican food from what he could tell. He could feel his stomach cramping up from his sudden hunger, his mouth watering as well. He hadn't had Mexican food in such a long time. Since he was in the Corp. really. \"You want some, don't you.\" \"Nah, you go ahead and eat. You didn't have anything before you left the house.\" \"T, there is enough here for two people. Jack isn't going to be eating it.\" \"He planned on eating it with you.\" Tommy replied. \"That's a little low.\" \"Fine, don't eat.\" She pouted. She was trying to be nice. But Tommy surprised her by laughing out loud. His usual goofy smile was back, catching her off guard. His eyes twinkled when he smiled or laughed genuinely. She did her best not to smile back. \"I forgot that look.\" \"What look?\" \"The one that gets me every time.\" Sammi's facade broke. She smiled brightly at him, truly happy that Tommy was back and not just physically. She knew there was more to his story and when he was ready to share she would be all ears. But for now, she would simply enjoy his company and enjoy that he was back. Having him back was a godsend, so to speak. She needed him more than her Tiger knew. Evening had come quickly today. It was around ten now. People usually started filing out around this time. But today hadn't been as busy and the gym had emptied out already. All except the real dedicated ones. Fenroy, Mad Dog, his trainers, and Tommy were left. Tommy was always the last one to leave the gym. He was merciless with his was training, he had always been. Today was no different. He had something on his mind. Somethings he had to deal with. His chat with his pops earlier in the day was one of them. His other problems were with what had happened in the corp. as well as the aftermath of it. Then there was Sammi and the jerk who was messing with her. \"Fork it over, Colt. Rent's due today.\" Colt Boyd, infamous trainer of the number one contender for the middleweight title, stared at her hard. He didn't really like the small Italian female, but his fighter did. His client only wanted to train here, calling it home. So Boyd obeyed, reluctantly. He rather have his fighters train where he could provide them with everything they needed to win a fight. This gym didn't cut it for him. It had nothing updated, none of the high tech equipment that helped good fighters become great. But Mad Dog wasn't going to have any of it. No matter how much Boyd begged him to. Mad Dog enjoyed this atmosphere. He liked the low key area where press weren't aloud to snap their cameras at him. Not that he minded. He loved the fame, but he loved his peace of mind too. Training was a serious business to him. He couldn't be a champion otherwise. Besides, Sammi brought a unique atmosphere too. \"Can't you wait till we leave to bug me?\" \"I can,\" Samina smiled. \"But the last time I waited you left without paying me. I have bills too you know.\" \"The amount of revenue you make can easily pay your bills, sweet cheeks.\" Tommy was listened from his punching bag, keeping an eye on Sammi from his position. He had a smirk on his lips. He knew Sammi well. Well enough to know not to call her nicknames when you weren't family. He called her babe once when they first met and she pinched his nipple so hard, he thought she had taken them off. It was drastic but it worked. He thought twice about it. He didn't call babe again until they kissed the first time. Not until they were official. He stopped boxing to stare up at Sammi. She had moved from her position on the floor to up on the ropes outside the ring. She was in Boyd's face now, glaring just as hard at him. She didn't say anything, didn't do anything. She was just staring at the bald little manager. He was an inch taller than her, but that didn't matter right now. That inch was being used against him now. \"Call me that again.\" she smiled. \"Go on, try it Boyd.\" Mad Dog laughed from inside of the ring. He instantly came to them and wrapped an arm around Sammi's small shoulders. He rubbed the top of her head teasingly. She shrugged him off and pointed at him. \"Watch your hands Grimes. It'll be hard to fight without mitts.\" she smirked. \"Whoa, touchy touchy.\" he grinned, his hands rising up in surrender. \"Easy, I was only messing around, Sam.\" \"Tell your manager I want my rent money in an hour. If I don't get it then, you no longer train here, Pete.\" she glared at Boyd before she left. Tommy had his arms crossed over his chest, watching closely. She shook her head and made her way over to him. She knew that look. Tommy was itching to fight Mad Dog. For male reasons, she was sure. \"T, let it go, whatever you are thinking let it go.\" \"I could take him.\" \"You know that and I know that but the poor soul doesn't. And you are never merciful.\" she smirked at him. Tommy's gaze left the ring. A slow smiling spread over his face as he stared back at the gym owner. She was grinning ear to ear at him. They both knew she was right. Tommy was a relentless fighter, a ferocious competitor. Mad Dog Grimes had no chance. No opponent did. Tommy turned back to his bag, readjusting the straps of his gloves around his wrists. Sammi watched him go at it, the muscles in his arms and back contorting as he hit it tenaciously. Her eyes traveled to his shoulders. They were dips and curves surrounding his neck muscles, his collar bone definitive with the rest of his upper body. He locked up side up as the bag spun with each of his blows. He calculated the punching bag's movements as it twirled to a stop only to be hit by him again. \"You want me to spot you?\" she called to him. Tommy hit the bag once more before turning to her. His eyes were dark from his concentration. She cringed inwards, knowing he hated it when he was interrupted with his work out. Her hands rose up in an apology, feeling bad for imposing on his work out. When she made it back to her office, she walked over to Ace who had been sitting near her desk the entire day. His head popped up as soon as she walked through her door. She petted him lazily before taking a seat in her chair. Sighing, she took her mail and began reading through her paperwork. Closing time came before she knew it, the hour zooming by. Grimes got Boyd to pay up just as they left. He loved training here and the threat Sammi had given him earlier did the trick. Boyd as always ignored her as he left. Grimes gave her a wink before he too darted out the door. Tommy and Fenroy were the only ones here with her. Ace who had spent majority of the day sleeping in her office, had finally come out, sniffing the area before walking her rounds with her. She had to make sure everything was secure before she set the alarm off. \"Roy, why don't you head off? I've got it here.\" \"You sure boss?\" he yelled from the other side of the gym. He eyed the men's locker. Tommy was taking a shower at the moment and it made her employee nervous to leave her here with him. Even if they were old friends. \"Yeah, I'm good. You go.\" she replied, shutting off some of the lights. \"I can wait.\" \"Roy... go!\" \"Alright, I'm going, I'm going.\" he said in defeat. If she wasn't bothered by the new guy, then in reality he shouldn't either. He had heard about what happened when he was off on his lunch break and he was thankful for the new guy being there for Sammi. He knew the men around here gave her a hard time. He ran across the gym, quickly gathering his things before heading to the door. Sammi was already there, waiting for him with a smile. \"Good night, Roy.\" \"Night boss, have a good day off tomorrow.\" he said with a smile as he walked past her. She locked it quickly, turning off the front neons. She had forgotten about that. Tomorrow she had a day off. It wasn't going to be a day off though. Tomorrow would be full of cleaning and errands, after of coarse her appointment. \"Ready to head home.\" she said to Ace. He came out of her office walking around the place when he knew when closing time was. Always on guard, he began tracing the walls with his nose after receiving a pet from her. Stifling a yawn, Sammi headed to the men's dressing room. Knocking on the closed door loudly, she yelled for Tommy. \"Tiger, you decent?\" No answer. Ace suddenly barked behind her, making her turn around just as she was to hit the door again. Only there was no door. Hard muscle met knuckles. \"Hey, watch it.\" Tommy said suddenly when the back of her fingers hit him square in the chest. Sammi jumped and took a step back, her hands cringing away from him. Her eyes grew wide instantly when they locked onto him. Tommy was dressed in only a white towel. It hung snugly on his hips, just above the bone. Her eyes magnetically went down his stomach, seeing he had another tattoo that was a scripture the led to his navel on his right side. How attractive... Sammi cringed at her thought. Her ears immediately felt hotter than the rest of her. They must have been red. Tommy only smirked at her reaction. \"Damn! Sorry T, didn't see you there.\" she giggled coyly, doing her best to play it off. Wayda go Ace... she thought. \"I'm almost done.\" he smirked. She gave him a curt nod. \"Make sure the windows and things are locked. Last thing I need is another break in.\" He frowned. \"Someone broke in?\" \"Yeah, I was asleep in my office when it happened. Some kids broke in to vandalize the gymnastics area. Never got the chance though. Ace scared them off real quick.\" Tommy crossed his arms over his chest, the muscles in his upper body going stiff with his new found emotion. He was upset. His grey eyes looked down at the dog, silently thanking him for being there. Sammi would never ask for help. She was proud that way. Italian blood made her so but the idea of someone breaking in while she was here alone didn't sit well with him. She was tough, but she was still smaller than most. She could only do so much for so long before someone got the upper hand on her. Yes, these were only kids at the time, but what if someone else with more dangerous intentions came through? What then? \"Why were you sleeping in your office?\" She sighed. \"Because I was dead tired and wanted to rest my eyes for a bit, but before I knew it it was three at night and they broke in...\" that was half right. And Tommy could tell but he didn't press it. \"Just be happy Ace was there.\" She nodded. \"Yeah, my hero.\" she smirked while petting her dog affectionately. But Tommy wasn't amused. He was angry with her for being careless. This was a big gym. Something could happen and no one would ever know. It infuriated him more that there was only one other who had a key, Fenroy who lived at least ten miles from here. He had stated that it was hard for him to find a place close by, but Sammi was really cool about letting him come in late sometimes because of the distance. Traffic this way was always horrible from the city center. That didn't help with Tommy's displeasure though. The only help she had here was not only quite a distance away but could be late once in a while. \"So you gonna drip dry or are you going to get dressed soon?\" her head was tilted to the side as she stared up at him. God he's cute... Tommy blinked back his anger. He smiled at her, giving her a slow nod. He would be angry another time. For now, he had Sammi here, safe and sound. That's all he could ask for really. \"I'm going. Give me five minutes.\" he sighed. \"Meet me in the office when you're done.\" she said slowly. A yawn suddenly took her and a frown appeared on her face. \"What you want for dinner?\" Tommy frowned as well. \"You planning on cooking?\" \"Well yeah, we gotta eat.\" He shook his head. Of coarse she was planning on cooking. Sammi was if not traditional when it came to the home. Home cooked meal was a must but Tommy had another idea. \"How bout we head to Stacey's?\" She grinned brightly at him. \"Stacey's? You serious? I haven't been there since...\" \"Since the Friday before I left.\" Tommy answered. She nodded. It had been their last outing really. It was right around the time Tommy and his mom had decided to leave Pittsburgh. It was that night he told her he was leaving. Sammi was not happy and really didn't say much that night, but she encouraged him that it was the right thing to do. His mom needed him now more than ever. It was going to be hard but he was a fighter by nature. They would make it. \"That's sounds really good.\" she laughed. \"I don't feel much for cooking tonight.\" truth be told she was exhausted today. Cooking would be a struggle. With having a two full on work days and then having Tommy return last night in between was tiring to say the least. Not that she didn't mind being busy. She was just feeling a bit peckish that she hadn't gotten to spend time with Tommy since his return. Going out to Stacey's, their old stomping ground would give her that chance at last. \"You look tired as it is. I can pay you back for dinner last night.\" She shook her head. \"This isn't about paying anyone back,T. This is us catching up and relaxing after a long day. Sound good?\" She could see the side of him that wanted to argue but in the end he nodded. He scratched the back of his head, his bicep flexing as he did so. Sammi reluctantly turned away, knowing she was staring again. \"I'll be in my office.\" she said walking off with Ace following her shortly. That cold shower was sounding better and better now that she thought about it. Within the five minutes, the two were off towards their old diner. It took them another five minutes to get there. The trip was spent mostly on what Tommy liked to eat, she was planning on getting some groceries tomorrow since she had a day off. Tommy as always was okay with anything she brought back. Somethings never change. However, Sammi became nervous all of a sudden as they approached the front doors of the Stacey's diner. Everything was coming back from that night. Tommy being super quiet all night and then breaking the ice, telling her that he was going away with his mom. He broke her heart that night, severely. She had never truly recovered from it either. But she knew that he needed to go. He needed to take care of his mom. So she supported him all the way, not letting her pain show through. But Tommy had seen her that night. He had seen the way she changed immediately. Her bright blue eyes saddened greatly. There was a look in them he had never seen before. Even till this day, it was still there. He had hurt her more than she had let on. Now that he had time to go over it in his head, all the signs were there. He had too much going on to see what was right in front of him. It wasn't until he and his mom settled in Tacoma did he really think about Sammi. It was the only thing hurting him all these years about leaving Pittsburgh. That and how his brother bailed on them. As soon as the couple entered the front door they were greeted by none other than Stacey himself. The diner owner stared at the two of them with wide eyes. Sammi immediately began to smile at the large man. He was half Greek, half Italian with a big personality. Almost as big as himself. He was born and raised in the neighborhood, even went to the same high school they did. He played a linemen for the four years he was at school, then went on to do the same in college. Even though Stacey had the opportunity to go on to the NFL, he chose not to. Instead he had wanted to start up a diner in his old neighborhood. Something both his families could agree on. Food. He was gawking at them from behind the front counter. \"It can't be. My two favorite customers have finally returned!\" Sammi laughed. \"I highly doubt we are your favorite customers, Stacey we haven't been back in years.\" But he shook his head. \"Are you kidding me? You two have always been the life of the party.\" She shook her head. \"How you been?\" He nodded, coming around to meet them. \"Good, good. I've been really good. How you kids been?\" Tommy and Sammi exchanged a look then both shrugged. \"You know us.\" was all Sammi said. Stacey took that as a good thing, which worked out fine for the both of them. \"You guys go take your old table.\" he said happily. \"Same orders?\" \"Same for me.\" \"Me too.\" Stacey looked over at Tommy, smiling as he looked him over. \"You've gotten really big, kiddo. You look good. Little Sammi must be pretty happy.\" Sammi shook her head again, covering her eyes. She could feel the tips of her ears heating up. She had forgotten how nosey Stacey was at times, especially when it came to their relationship. But she knew his heart was in the right place. He had watched them grow up and was tight knit with both the families. He was just a bit forceful at times, like a nagging mother. A very hairy nagging mother. That made her laugh. \"Always the comedian, Stace.\" Sammi said walking off. Both Tommy and Stacey stared at her as she went to their infamous booth in the back, taking her normal seat by the window. \"It's good to see her out and about again.\" Tommy frowned as he stared up at the larger man. \"What do you mean?\" \"She didn't tell you?\" \"Tell me what?\" Stacey looked apprehensive all of a sudden. \"I think you should talk to her about it, Tommy. It's her story to tell. But I will say this, having you back has brought her back.\" he smiled and patted Tommy on the shoulder before turning and heading back to the kitchen. Tommy stood there bewildered by the diner owner. What in the world did that mean? His gaze went over to Sammi. She was staring out the window. There was a park across the street where they grew up playing on the playground. She was smiling into the dark night. Slowly he made his way to her. He stood at the end of their table, his hands in his hoodie pocket in front of him. He had a frown on his handsome face. He would never think Sammi to hide things from him, especially if they were important. Then again, she hid things when she thought she was protecting him. There were times in their lives where she wouldn't say anything if something was bothering her. She was just keep it to herself and that infuriated him more than anything. What was the point of having him for a boyfriend, if she didn't trust him? He didn't understand it. \"Why is Stacey saying its good to see you out again?\" Sammi turned to face him, noticing the deep frown. \"What do you mean?\" \"That's what he said.\" Tommy replied, taking the booth seat across from her. It was bizarre being back here. As soon as he sat down, the memories of their childhood came flooding back. They spent every friday here after school, eating doing homework, chatting up a storm or simply enjoying each other's company. They were simpler times for the both of them. Sammi did her best to hide the panicked look in her eyes. Her blue orbs were wide as she stared at Tommy and then over to Stacey behind the counter cooking their food. Everyone in the neighborhood had heard about what happened that night and it was no surprise that Stacey did as well. Telling Tommy would be the hardest thing and truthfully she didn't know if she could.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 \"I don't go out as much... that's probably what he's going on about.\" Tommy looked at her for a few more seconds then shrugged it off. Sammi was lying, he already knew it, but he also knew she would eventually tell him. He sat down opposite her taking his heavy coat off. Absentmindedly, he handed it over to her. Sammi smirked. \"What are you doing?\" Tommy sat frozen, unsure of what he was doing. It was so natural for him to just hand his coat over to her. Something he used to do back in high school. The window they sat near had it's weather stripping falling apart, the cold air coming in freely. Sammi would constantly ask for his jacket when it was cold and he would happily give it to her. Apparently she liked how it smelled. Sammi tried to stifle her laugh as Tommy began to frown. \"I'll take it though, if you're really giving it to me.\" \"My arm's getting tired.\" She shook her head and put it on. Just as always, it was larger than her, but it was much bigger than she remembered it to be. It completely swallowed her. \"Looks good on you.\" \"Yeah? Think it'll start a trend?\" She pulled the edges of the collar up to her eyes, modeling her face and doing her best to make him laugh too. It worked because Tommy was stifling his own laugh pretty soon. \"Thanks though, I'm glad you remembered, somewhat.\" she straightened up before looking underneath the table. Ace was layaing between their feet. She moved her own so she would kick the poor pup. She had a tendency to kick when she was sitting. \"He's napping.\" \"Yeah, he's had a long day.\" Tommy replied. Sammi caught him yawning as she sat back up. A small smile came to her lips. \"He isn't the only one.\" \"It's been hard to sleep lately.\" \"Why? Is something keeping you up?\" Tommy said nothing. He wasn't about to tell her that it was the dreams that had haunted him for a while now. Being in the military had taught him to keep quiet about certain things. This was one of them. What he had done back there wasn't for anyone else to know. Especially Sammi. If she'd found out, he didn't know how she would take it. Sammi was from a military family. To her service was honor. \"Tommy, if something is wrong, you know you can talk to me about it. I'm here for you.\" Sammi said softly. She reached over and squeezed his hand. He gave her a nod and a smirk. \"Yeah I know, Sammi. Same goes for you.\" Before she could reply he continued. \"I know something's wrong Sammi. I know you better than anyone else. Something happened when I was away. Something bad, but if you don't want to talk about it, I won't push you to. You obviously survived without me and I'm proud of you for that, but you gotta know I'm here now. Whatever it was, you can tell me.\" It was Sammi's turn not to say anything. She could feel her eyes watering up. Things had happened for sure, things that were out of her control. Tommy not being here when it all went down broke her further. It was hard and she did indeed survive, but not without a few scars along they way. \"I guess I'm not that good at hiding it anymore.\" she smiled sadly. \"No you are,\" Tommy disagreed. \"I just know when you're lying.\" She choked out a laugh. She hated it when he was right, but she also loved it when he paid attention. Tommy was always considerate growing up, but there was always something on his mind. Mostly his family issues. Sammi was on rare occasion with him. It never meant he cared any less for her, but she did come in second when it came to his head. Sometimes third when it came to his wrestling. Sammi never said anything though, she kept it mostly to herself. She knew he was dealing with a lot for a high school student. She gave his hand another squeeze. \"I'll let you know when the time is right, Tiger. I promise, but right now I see our food coming.\" \"Here you go.\" Stacey all but shouted. He set the plates of food on the table in front of them. \"Thanks Stace\" tommy said. \"Yeah, no problem. I'm just happy you guys are back. Tell you what, since you guys came back, I'll cover the tab.\" He laughed. \"Aw, no Stacey. We'll pay.\" Sammi protested but Stacey wasn't having it. \"Nonsense. You kids enjoy your food.\" Both Tommy and Sammi watched the large man leave. \"I can't believe that man sometimes.\" \"It's nice to know he hasn't changed either.\" \"I'll leave him a big tip. He can't stop me from doing that.\" Tommy nodded. \"Food's getting cold, let's eat.\" They ate in silence, enjoying the meal. Both had forgotten how good Stacey could cook. By the time they finished, they had been the last ones left. It was a little after midnight now anyways. Though Stacy's diner was open twenty-four hours, it still had it's dead spots. Sammi thought it best to call it a night anyways. Both she and Tommy were dog tired. She figured the diner owner would like to get some rest too. \"Good night Stacy!\" \"Good night you two! Don't be strangers, you hear?\" He shouted back from somewhere in the kitchen. \"Yes, sir.\" Sammi laughed her reply. Tommy let her and Ace pass first, holding the door open for them before walking out himself. The night air was colder now than when they had come, mostly due to how late it was. Their trip home was also quite like their meal. Tommy was off in his own head. Sammi knew that look and knew not to bother with it. She stared out the bus window the entire trip home. Ace who sat near her was up and perking as always. He liked being out this late for some they arrived home, he came in first and immediately went into the bedroom. \"Well someone's happy to be home.\" \"I think he was just cold.\" Sammi smiled. \"I'll get him out so you can rest.\" \"You are not taking the couch again, Sammi.\" \"No, I don't mind really.\" \"But I do, I rather take the couch.\" Tommy insisted. He immediately went to it and sat down. Sammi crossed her arms. \"You're not budging are you?\" \"No, I'm not. Take the bed. Good night.\" Sammi sighed in defeat. She knew it was no use when he was like this. He was stubborn as a mule when he wanted his way. \"Oh alright, Good night.\" she shook her head and headed into the room. She thought about the closing the door, but thought against it. It would be easier to get out without waking him in the morning. But it backfired mid through her sleep. Tommy woke to the sound of whimpers coming from the bedroom. He got up immediately knowing it was Sammi crying in her sleep. Slowly he made his way into the bedroom, catching Sammi's fidgeting form on one side of the bed, her back to him bare from her night shirt riding up mid way. But something caught his eye, something he wasn't expecting. Three heavy scars. He froze as he came to the edge of the bed when he realized what they were. Surgical scars parallel to her spine sat prominently on her lower and mid back. \"Tiger...\" Sammi whispered as she awoke. She had faintly heard footsteps come from behind her in her sleep. Ace's movement on the bed also had stirred her awake. She wasn't a light sleeper as it was, but she wasn't used to having someone else being here. It put her on edge sometimes. \"It's me.\" Tommy replied softly. His eyes were still stuck on her spine. \"You were uh, crying in you sleep.\" She got up slowly, groaning. Her back was stiff and her knee hurt. \"Really? Did I wake you?\" \"No,\" he lied. She rubbed her eyes of the sleep before turning to look at him. Tommy gaze was hard as if he was trying to figure something crucial out right now. It was disturbing because he was staring at her like that. \"What is it?\" she asked, slightly worried about what was going on in his head. \"What happened to your back?\" Sammi blinked, fully awake now. \"What do you mean?\" \"Did you have back surgery? You've got scars on your back as if you've had an operation, more than one by the looks of it.\" It was then she realized her shirt had rode up her back as she tossed and turned in her sleep. She fixed it quickly as if she could hide what he saw. At this point Sammi's entire body was going stiff with fear. She didn't want to open that wound again, the wound that took her so long to close up. Tommy deserved to know though, she just hoped he didn't take as his fault some how. He would though because he wasn't here for her, he would take the blame. She had to make him understand that it was just a freak accident. It took her this long to figure that out herself. Sighing she nodded. \"I've had three different surgeries to fix my spine.\" \"What happened to it?\" She cringed and squeezed her eyes shut, gathering her strength. She had to tell him. It was so long ago, but she remembered everything from the night. \"I was in a car crash.\" Tommy froze. He had no idea. \"When did this happen?\" \"... two weeks after you left...a couple of days before regionals. Dad was driving, mom in the passenger seat. Damian and Michael had come home from tour for and we were invited to have dinner at Aunt Olivia's place...\" He sat next her on the bed, his gaze soft. Tommy's mind was trying to grasp what had happened. Sammi continued as the memory took her. \"We were at a four way stop, crossing the intersection. A drunk drive came from my side and hit us dead on... He must have been going at least eighty...\" she raised up her right pajama leg up to her mid thigh. \"It shattered my knee completely.\" Tommy was fixated on the large vertical scar of her knee. It began three inches about her knee cap and ended mid shin. It looked brutal and the scar itself had still yet to heal completely. It had been fourteen years since him leaving Pittsburgh, but the wounds hadn't healed. \"I don't know how many times the car flipped, but I was told at least six-to-eight.\" she said softly. Her blue eyes occupied with the scar as well. It began to hurt suddenly. She wasn't sure if it was physiologically or if it was actually hurting, but she began rubbing it tenderly nonetheless. \"The driver of the car died on impact... As did everyone else.\" Tommy's head snapped from her knee to her face. Her eyes were glossed over with her unspilled tears. She was fighting them calmly, breathing evenly and deeply. He couldn't believe that was what she was holding in this entire time. When he had asked about her family the first night, she said she wasn't in the mood to talk about it. No wonder. Even stacey left clues. Her being out and about again was what he was talking about. Her accident. \"I was the only one who survived...\" she whispered. \"I can't believe why though... me of all people. Michael and Damian, both coming home from tour, only to be killed here at home... Same with Dad... and mom... it wasn't fair.\" her tears had fallen down her cheeks by now. Remembering her family was always hard and painful. \"The worse part was I never got to see them buried. I never made it to the funeral.\" \"What do you mean made it?\" Tommy asked quietly. Surely Sammi would have gone to the funeral. She wouldn't have missed it for the world. \"The accident caused more than just a shattered knee and back.\" She said wiping her tear streaked cheeks. Turning to face Tommy, she pushed aside her hair to the left side of her face. Parting her hair on the right side, she revealed another scar. A short thin trauma to the skin horizontally placed a few inches from her ear. Tommy reached out, turning her head slightly to get a better look. His touch was gentle, placing a hand under her chin. Few more tears spilled out as her eyes shut. He felt the scar with a compassionate caress. This injury was somewhat healed as well. Sammi sighed. \"I never made it because I was in a coma... it took eight months for me to make it out of it... and by that time...\" \"The funeral had already take place.\" Tommy finished for her. \"I didn't even know they hadn't made it...\" she cried softly. \"Olivia had just said I missed the funeral... no one said anything about their deaths.\" His heart broke for her. The amount of pain she went through, both physically and emotionally was unimaginable. He should have been there for her. She going through all this without anyone, angered him immensely. He was angry at himself mostly. He knew something was bothering her from the start. He should have said something earlier. \"Sammi...\" he said calmly, upset with both himself and the news he had just heard. His hand went down to her cheek, cupping her face gently. \"No, you don't.\" she replied quickly. She heard the tone in his voice and she knew he was beating himself up right now. \"This wasn't on you. Not one bit. Don't blame yourself for some idiot's mistake.\" \"Sam, I should have been here with you—.\" \"—No you had to be with your mother. She was the one who needed you.\" Her tone was adamant and gave him no room to argue. She smiled through her tears, her blue eyes shimmering with the rising sunlight in the room. \"You were where you needed to be, Tiger. I survived my accident.\" \"You lost everyone, Sammi.\" Her smiled saddened a bit as she nodded, but she turned to his hand that cupped her cheek, kissing it. \"I didn't loose you, T. You came back.\" Tommy didn't feel any better about this, but he nodded. A small smile came to his lips as he watched her snuggle his hand. Her skin was just as soft as he remembered it to be, maybe even softer. He began stroking her cheek softly, bringing the brightness in her smile again. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you.\" \"It's okay, I'm just glad you did.\" Slowly, he pulled her closer. He kissed her forehead and hugged her to his chest. The tension that was in her body slowly left her as she hugged him back. The pain in her spine and knee slowly had dissipated, but it was still faintly there. \"I have my last appointment today.\" she said quietly. \"As in check up?\" she heard Tommy ask. He was slightly surprised at the fact she would still be seeing a doctor after all this time. Then again, she did suffer a head trauma. \"No rehab. It's the last one for my knee and back.\" She sounded relieved. \"When is it?\" \"At ten.\" Tommy knew it was barely five in the morning. \"We've got time.\" \"What do you mean 'we'?\" Sammi pulled away to look at him in the eyes. \"I'm coming with you.\" she smirked. \"Why? It's not like I need help.\" \"I want to say that I went to at least one.\" He replied calmly. \"Besides, it'll be like old times.\" \"Tiger, you went to only one of my meets and you had said it was enough for you.\" Tommy smirked. He dried her cheeks with his thumbs. \"That was a long time ago.\" \"You said you wanted to come.\" She pouted slightly. \"At the time we had just stared dating. I wanted to be supportive.\" \"By lying.\" \"That's not fair.\" Tommy defended. They were both smirking at this point. \"I wanted to support you. You never missed any of my matches. I didn't think it was fair I never went to any of yours meets. Anyways, you never invited me to come. I had to ask you if I could.\" There was no winning with this man. She had already lost this round by laughing. Tommy knew it as well. His smirk was borderlines arrogant. She merely shook her head, confirming it for him that he had won. He was coming with her to her rehab appointment and there was nothing she could do to tell him otherwise. \"I'm going back to sleep. I've got a couple of hours to go before I need to leave.\" she said, laying back down on her side. Just as her back hit the mattress again, Tommy did the same next to her, his arms crossed behind his head. She gave him a funny look as to what he was doing. \"You'd leave without giving me a heads up.\" He said staring up at her ceiling. \"I'm staying.\" Next this he knew, Sammi was snuggling into him, her head placed gently on the right side of his chest. An arm came over as she pulled the blanket up to cover them both. \"I hate you know me so well...\" she whispered. \"Thank you.\" \"Thank you for not changing, Sammi. It's nice to know you're still the same.\" \"Somewhat, yes... but I did grow up.\" \"I ain't complaining.\" \"Shut up and get some sleep, Tiger.\" Sammi whispered, smacking is stomach lightly as she stiffled a laugh. Her sleep had come quickly for the first time in a long time. She didn't know if it was due to her telling her story and letting it all out. Or if it was simply because Tommy was here with her. She stopped trying to figure things out now. It was just really good to have him in her arms again. She gave him a light squeeze around the middle before drifting off to sleep again. Tommy on the other had stayed awake for another ten minutes. He was wrapping his head around Sammi and her trauma. He had seen the scars and heard her stories, but his mind just couldn't grasp the accident. He knew her family. They always made him feel as if he was a part of it too. Secretly he always envied her because of it. But it made him furious to think they were gone just as his mother was. It seemed the good people always did die young. His gaze softened as his eyes drifted from the ceiling to Sammi laying on his chest. She was the only one left. Brendan, his mom, his good for nothing father. Everyone had left him. She was so close to going as well. The accident had take a lot from her. But she came back from it. She was always a fighter and he loved her spirit because of it. She pushed him to his limits, knew he could always achieve what he wanted to if he worked at it. It was about time he did the same for her. He just didn't know how. ","Summary":" A/N: Hello everyone.

He grabbed a thrush for him and Sandstorm to share. He went back to her and said, \" I brought us some food. You should eat.\" \"Ok,\" Sandstorm replied as she curled up next to Firestar. Later on, Firestar went out of camp. \"I'm heading out of camp for a bit,\" he said to BrambleFur. He replied to Firestar with a nod. Once Firestar was out of camp, he decided to hunt. All of the sudden, a small rustle could be heard. It was too big to be a mouse, and too small to be bigger than a cat. BAM! Sandstorm jumped out. \"Hi firestar!\" She said cheerily. \"Hey Sandstorm!\" He said, admiring her. \"Wanna hunt with me,\" Firestar asked. \"Wait, before we do, I need to tell you something. I'm expecting! Squirrel flight and leaf pool will have siblings!\" Firestar'a jaw dropped, \"This is great! You need to take it easy though,\" he said, \"How far along are you?\" \"About two moons!!\" 6 moons later All of the sudden Sandstorm started convulsing. \"THE KITS ARE COMING!!!\" She yelled. Jayfeather quickly ran over, \"Squirrelflight get a stick! LeafPool get some poppy seeds! These kits are early,\" Jayfeather said. He gently pressed on Sandstorms stomach as she pushed for the first kit. A small grey and white tom came out. Then, a small orange she cat. A bright bundle of gold came out, a tom. And last but not least, a gold she cat with white paws. \"Congrats!!\" Everyone said. Once firestar came in, they started naming. A maple leaf landed on the small orange she cat. \"How about Maplekit?\" Firestar and Sandstorm said. Then, the gold she cat, with white paws, ate a poopy seed. \"How about Poppykit?\" Sandstorm suggested. Then, they named the small grey and white tom Lightkit and the bright gold tom was named Brightkit. Two moons later \"Brightkit!! That's not fair!!\" Poppykit huffed. \"It was my turn to catch a leaf!\" \"Now now,\" Sandstorm said,\"There is enough leaves for everycat.\" Lightkit and maplekit were busy chasing a butterfly. Firestar had gone out hunting. When he came back he brought a vole and a mouse. He gave the vole to Sandstorm. By nightfall, they had gone to sleep. Firestar curled around his mate and his kits thinking, what a great family, with Sandstorm, MapleKit, Lightkit, Poppykit, and Brightkit. As well as LeafPool and SquirrelFlight.[Chapter 2] Sorry this chapter is short!! Any questions in the review section will be answered :P Only my second chapter ever btw Maplekits pov By dawn, almost everycat was awake. \"Lightkit!\" Maplekit purred as she jumped on him. Even though he was tiny, he was able to throw her off. \"Gotcha!!\" He purred, puffing out his chest. Then, Poppykit jumped on him, surprising him. \"YEEP!! You scared the stars out of me!\" He half yelled half screamed. -Poppykit's pov- I got off of Lightkit as Firestar brought us some fresh kill. It was our first time trying it. I mean we are four moons old, so Firestar wanted us to try it. He pawed a thrush over to us. \" Here you go. Eat up!\" He said excitedly while Sandstorm purred with amusement. Sandstorm got up and watched me take me first bite. \"It's delicious!!\" I said purring,\" I love it.\" 2 moons later \"Today's our apprentice ceremony!\" Brightkit spillled with excitement. \"I can't wait to be Brightpaw!\" \"I can't wait to be Maplepaw!\" \"I can't wait to be Lightpaw\" \"ANNNDDDD IIIIIIIII can't wait to be DUN DUM DUN DUNNNN! Poppypaw! Goes well together.\" They all pranced around. \"Let all cats old enough to catch their prey gather around the high rock for a calm meeting! We have four ceremonies!\" All the kits gathered round. Lightkit had wanted to pursue the medicine route. So he told Firestar. He asked Willowfoot and she was okay with it. Plus he already knew every herb and where to find it. Firestar and Willowfoot were the only ones who knew. \"Lightkit you will know be known as lightpaw. Your mentor will be Willowfoot, as you have decided to pursue the medicine life.\" Lightfoot touched noses with Willowfoot.[Chapter 3] Lightpaw felt pride as everyone shouted their names. \"LIGHTPAW, MAPLEPAW, POPPYPAW, BRIGHTPAW!\" The clan yelled their names, Firestar and Sandstorm the loudest. Lightpaw sat next to his mentor, Willowfoot. \"I'm proud of you! I'm so excited to have you as an apprentice,\" Willowfoot said, pride gleaming on her bright green eyes. \"I'm excited to have you as a mentor,\" Lightpaw said. He really was, but he wasn't sure if he was going to be good at it. Maplepaw's Pov I sat down next to my mentor as our names were called. I was so surprised I made it. Six moons old, I thought, Hailpaw is pretty cute and he is sweet. \"Maplepaw, we start training tomorrow, go rest up,\" MistyShade, the black she cat said. I got up and headed towards the apprentice den. My first night. I chose a nest towards the entrance, as it was comfortable and had no scent. My sister, Poppypaw, Took the nest to my right. Poppypaw's pov I prodded my sister, Maplepaw awake. \"Today's our first day of training,\" I squealed and she grumbled. She was tired and wouldn't get up. So I pounced on her. Sun high I just learned my way around camp, well at least sorta. \"Do you smell that?\" I asked Hailpaw. \"Yeah it's really gross,\" Hailpaw said. Hailpaw was apprenticed the same day as us, so he was new too. \"It's just the Riverclan cats,\" MistyShade and FernFlower, Hailpaw's mentor, said. As we headed aback to camp, I caught a plump vole! And it was my first catch! I brought it to the queens and they praised me. I settled down for a squirrel as Hailpaw asked to share with me. Of course I couldn't say no. We shared and he kinda flirted. Maplepaw shot us a dirty look. Hailpaw asked, \"What was all that about?\" \"Honestly I have no idea,\" I said sighing. After that, I went to my nest and tumbled into sleep.[Chapter 4] -Maplepaw's POV- I woke up to my sister, Poppypaw, prodding me in the side. \"What?\" I said grumpily, turning over on my other side. \"It's time to train,\" she said, \"What was that look for anyway?\" She asked. I stood up and stretched. \"Well,\" She turned her head to the side,\" I like Hailpaw,\" I whispered faintly. \"And you two were flirting.\" Poppypaw Point of View \"Oh,\" I meowed softly, \"Come on we have to go train,\" I said, quickly changing the subject. I ran over to my mentor, Mapleshade. \"What are we doing today?\" I asked. Maplehsade laughed, \"Well, today we are trading with the other apprentices and their mentors.\" \"Oh,\" I meowed. I felt guilty for flirting with Hailpaw when my sister liked him. But so do I, I thought, and he was flirting with me. Hailpaw slid up beside me, his soft pelt touching mine. We trailed behind our mentors, nobody uttering a single word. Once we were there, we were taught a battle move that we had to practice on the other apprentices. I, of course, was paired up with Hailpaw. I replayed the instructions in my head as I did it. Pretend to jump above, slide under, swipe belly. Then, you spin around once out from under them and leap on their back, clawing. Of course we did it with sheathed claws. \"Nice job,\" Hailpaw purred. \"Thanks,\" I said, out of breath. When we were done, my mentor and Hailpwas, along with Hailpaw and I, headed back to camp. We caught prey on the way, and I deposited it into the fresh kill pile once we were there. As soon as I brought prey to the elders, as well as Firestar and Sandstorm, I ate. Then, I immediately went to the apprentice den, falling asleep almost immediately, my tail over my nose.

Thought Flick as the Reservoir Dogs walk past her, Keep your head down! Read your book. They won't notice you. The truth was Flick was really trying to read her book, she loved to read. But it was the also the ease of which it provided an escape from talking to acquaintances that she really liked. The old tattered book form the back of her father's library seemed interesting enough; it was about a guy who wanted to kill his lover and wife so he could get with another woman. How romantic, who could ask for more? Flick had no time to answer before they sat behind her, cursing and laughing whilst drinking coffee. Sinking further into the faded fabric booth, she tried to block out the sound of the men talking. Unfortunately she knew all of them, each did business with Uncle Joe , who wasn't actually her Uncle it just gave him a chance to let his son gawp at her on a regular basis, because you know they were all 'close family' so they visited every fucking week. The cursing got louder as the one named Mr. Blue explained the real plot of some movie she'd never seen. \"Shut up,\" she dared to whisper under her breath. Uncle Joe had told her not to mouth off to anyone he worked with as they were nasty people. Nasty , that wasn't the word to describe them, brutal, stupid and violent were three that sprung to mind immediately. Despite bury her head in Romeo and Juliet Flick's patience with the Reservoir Dogs was about to run out, hanging on by a thread, it's about to fall, Oh look you've all fallen to your deaths! And with those thoughts Flick turned around and lost it. \"For the love of God will you shut up!\" Flick shouted bring the conversation to a halt. \"Excuse me?\" The blue eyed one called Mr. Pink lent across the table and angrily asked. \"I said,\" Flick lowered her voice, \"For. The. Love. Of. God. Will. You. Shut. Up.\" She spoke to him as if he was retarded, a bad move, but very brave. \"I think we need to teach this one a lesson,\" he jeered to all the other as Mr. Pink rose from his seat. Flick was now stood opposite Pink, ready for a fight. \"Bring it on Pink,\" Teased Flick, obviously by his reaction he didn't know she knew his name. That was it, something in Pink snapped. He launched across the table only for Flick to step out of the way and for Uncle Joe to grab the scuff of his collar. \"Sit down you prick, leave her alone,\" He threw him back and sat down, patting the seat next to him for her to sit there. \"Hey Flick, I didn't know you were here.\" Eddie, Uncle Joe's son, greeted her. \"Well you should do, you follow me everywhere.\" Flick unenthusiastically remarked. It was unintentionally funny, everyone laughed as Eddie sat down embarrassed. \"So what brings you here?\" Joe asked squeezing her shoulder. \"I was actually going round to yours to see if Eddie wanted dinner and sex tonight,\" Lied Flick. \"Really!\" Eddie jerked from behind his coffee. \"No,\" Flick said flatly. Another round of laughter at the table, God they were easy to please. \"Seriously, what are you doing here?\" Asked the familiar Mr. White with whom she had become friends with over the past weeks after he spilt beer on her when he was visiting Uncle Joe. \"I was just wandering and wanted a cup of coffee that tastes like sewage so I thought this was the place.\" Flick laughed, White laughed, Joe laughed. Everyone laughed except the waitress stood next to her about to take their orders. \"I'm sorry, I really do like your coffee, I was only joking,\" the waitress perked up after that, showing her massive breasts through a practically transparent blouse. When the coffee came the usual guy talk continued. Only one of them didn't join in, the new one, at least from what she recollected he was new. Orange, that was it his name was Mr. Orange. He had green yes with slicked back strawberry blonde hair, a total contrast to her white curled hair that fell to her pelvis and her sharp grey eyes. Flick was unsure whether to start conversation with him, but he didn't look interested and daydreamed. \"Right let's get going, you too Flick, let me go pay the bill.\" Uncle Joe stood up and walked off. The men looked at each other, sending a telepathic message: Who's going to hit on her first? \"Not me,\" Vic Vega, she was sure of it, or more recently known as Mr. Blonde said \"I don't fuck insolent little bitches who don't respect men,\" Obviously Flick was offended and without thinking she retorted, \"That's just as well because I don't fuck ugly shit faced fags,\" An almost silent laugh rippled through the tense atmosphere. \"You've really got a knack for pissing off strangers, haven't you?\" Pink asked ignoring the rage Mr. Blonde was about to show. \"It's my specialty,\" I smile sarcastically at him. Uncle Joe appeared at the table before anything could really kick off. \"Come on we need to get going, Flick you don't have to do anything important today do you?\" \"No,\" \"Good you're gonna come in handy,\"[Chapter 2] Uncle Joe's Quarters As they all stood up, Flick realised how tough she really was. None of the other men would walk near her, each coward as she walked past them. \"Nasty my ass,\" She whispered under her breath. Back at Uncle Joe's office, Flick finally felt comfortable. For years she had visited Uncle Joe's 'office', so much so it now felt like a second home. As they all clambered in through the entrance Flick saw it as her chance to escape. Unsuccessfully though, Uncle Joe called her back as soon as he saw her step away. \"Before you disappear we have work to discuss and you're needed.\" Flick unenthusiastically followed, mumbling under her breath that 'it can't be that important'. All the men filed in behind Uncle Joe, except Orange, he slowly walked up the stairs, dare I say it even less enthusiastic than Flick. \"Come on Orange, he ain't that bad.\" Flick tried to smile but her words startled Orange and he didn't know how to answer. He quickened his step and ran into Uncle Joe's office. The group assembled in lines, the only space left was next to Mr. Brown, he can't be that bad; the poor sod has a name that sounds like shit. Uncle Joe started to talk and Flick immediately zoned out, she wanted nothing to do with this, but knew she had no choice; Uncle Joe was paying for her University next year so that left her with her hands tied. Her reason for not wanting to help was a tragic sob story of which she told no-one as they wouldn't believe her. The bad images flooded back and Flick grabbed the scar on her leg where she had been hit hit that night. The pain had started again, no-one noticed her pain because she never showed it to anybody, when the ambulance arrived for her father she contemplated not telling them she was hurt as well. \"Flick, Flick can you hear me?\" Uncle Joe shoved her on the shoulder; she let out a tiny yelp and focused again. \"Can I help?\" she coolly said. \"These men need your help, you know the usual stuff,\" Uncle Joe gave a husky laugh. \"Fine, meet me in the basement after this meeting finishes, don't be late.\" Flick walked out and down into the freezing basement Uncle Joe had preserved for her. Twenty minutes after the meeting had finished, they finally arrived, cocky as ever, wanting to annoy her, and though she didn't show it, they had really pissed her off. \"Oh thank God you've finally arrived, I thought you might have got lost, you know because your brains are so tiny,\" They all mumbled, not wanting to be there, be taught by a girl. Each of them dragged a chair and formed a line, lit up their cigarettes and started to blow smoke rings. \"Right, Pink stand up,\" Flick pointed to him, he slumped out of his chair and slowly walked to her. \"Get your gun out, point it at me. I'm going to show you how to deal with this type of situation.\" Mr. Pink stood there and laughed, she couldn't hurt him. How wrong he was. Within seconds of pulling his gun out she had it out of his hand and he was pressed up against the wall. Everyone stopped; no-one said anything but Mr. White who had been through this before. \"Very good Flick, I see school hasn't stifled you're skill.\" He laughed knowing that everyone else in the room would have to go through what just happened to Mr. Pink. She curtseyed and waited for the next man to step up. Each was the same, panicked when they were against the wall. Apart from when it was Mr. Orange's turn. He fought back, hard. \"Well, looks like we finally got some brains on this job,\" Said the undereducated Eddie. Orange and Flick grappled for a while, but eventually Flick was on top, red faced and sweating. \"That was fantastic, don't be too upset if I don't call,\" She helped Orange up then walked out, sweat dripping from her neck to the base of her back. Now all Flick did was wait outside and listen to the conversation that fell after the session. It wasn't creepy or anything, she did it with every group. \"Damn she is so fucking hot,\" Brown said lighting up another cigarette. \"Like Debbie Harry,\" Someone said but they all agreed in unison. They talked for a few minutes about how women who were attractive got through life for free and that they never settled down and became mothers and wives, like women were supposed to .The only one that didn't input anything in to the conversation was Orange; he just sat blowing smoke rings, looking absent minded. It wasn't embarrassment that kept him quiet though. He was thinking about her, just like the rest of them, but in a less pornographic way. Flick walked down the stairs refreshed and changed, now aware of how the group felt about her. It wasn't surprising, a group of men as sexist as they were couldn't have been more stereotypical. \"I want everybody to stand in a circle around me.\" She stood in the middle of the concrete floor while they lazily formed a circle. Or what they thought was a circle. When everything was quiet and the circle was now a proper circle Flick began, \"Look to your left, they're your friends.\" She said pacing in the middle, her voice calm and soothing. \"Look to your right, they are your enemies.\" \"But that doesn't make sense; it means our friends are our enemies.\" Brown sounded the thoughts of everyone else in the room. \"No, it shows you that you can trust every one and you can trust no-one. Someone who may be your friend may also be your enemy. That's how you have to think on jobs like these. It's every man for himself and every man for every man.\" Flick broke the circle, her 'sessions' never really lasted that long, it was all about preparation. And if she was honest, she didn't like the men in the room. Each one seemed to be hiding something, apart from their names. ","Summary":" -1- The Diner Shit!

I have permission to post this so please, no flames. Please read the original first before mine. Updates will take a while due to year end exams. Please fav/follow and review. This takes place after the last update of \"The Fox and the Hound: Upbringing\") \"Things are not getting worse. They are becoming uncovered. We must hold each other tight and continue to pull back the veil.\" Author unknown As the sun disappeared behind the waterfall, a cool breeze picked up, causing the kits to climb out. Fyre was the first out, loathing the idea of having to stay close to his father's killer. Copper wasn't on this planet. His mind had become flooded with painful memories. It was only when Bolt shifted between his legs that he hound dog snapped out of his trance. He glanced down at the shivering ball of red fluff, unaware of the suns disappearing act. \"Uncle C-Copper, do you think w-we could start heading home?\" Bolt asked between the attack of shivers. Copper nodded and led the small group of kits home. At the Tweed farm, Vixey waited patiently for her kits and Copper to return. Although the sun had disappeared behind the mountains and night was fast approaching, she was sure the hound dog would have them on their way home. Rustling from a nearby bush soon grasped her attention to an unexpected visitor. \"Oh Cop... Chief? What a surprise! Did the master let you off the leash?\" Vixey asked with slight disappointment turning into sarcasm. \"Well, I guess yea can say that. Where're those kids o' yours?\" the wolfhound asked, shrugging of the sound of disappointment. Vixey was about to reply when she was crowded by her kits who were eager to tell her about the days fun. Copper arrived a good few seconds later, clearly disturbed and focusing hard on something. Vixey quickly tells her kits that food is ready and to go inside. Once the circle of red fluff had shuffled inside, Copper wasted no time reliving his long awaited tears. As the tears rolled freely down his face, he felt his sides being sandwiched between two warm bodies, the bodies of his \"family\". Once his sobbing had subsides, Vixey decided to test the waters,\" Copper, what happened?\" He looks at her, tears still trickling slowly down his exhausted face, he said, \"They... They went there.\" Chief had no clue about what his adopted son was saying. \"Where?\" he curiously asked. Copper's sobering became louder, loud enough to alert Fyre. Sitting closer to the door then his siblings, he was just out of earshot. He decided to get closer to listen in on the conversation. He swiftly ran behind the patio rails, where he could see and hear everything without being seen or at least where he hoped he wouldn't. Copper tried to lower his volume, but was not as successful as he would've hoped. \"The w-waterfall! Where else?\" he blurted out. It took a while until his sobbing subsided, but when he did, he began to explain, \"After you told me the kits were at the w-waterhole,\" he said, turning to face the vixen beside him, \"I set out to find them, but I picked up their trail going somewhere else. I followed it and... And I found them paying in the pool at the bottom. I-I-I tried to act normal and join in, it was working, and then Fyre walked off. I didn't think much about it, un-til he returned. He seemed upset, tired and just overall weak,\" he began to cry until he was basically screaming blue murder. \"It reminded me about his father's last moments... I co-couldn't help...\" His crying had now been heard by everyone, including the kits. The kits put a hold to their eating once they heard the sound of their uncle whaling. The worried kits dashed towards the door and, once they found the hound dog without physical injury, they walked over to him and pressed their little bodies against him, all but one. Fyre stayed behind. Although he had just seen and heard that Copper tried to help his best friend, his main thought was still fixed on his earlier conversation with the porcupine. Chief knew this wasn't doing Vixey or her kits much good. Slowly rising to his feet, he nudged his adopted son and softly said, \"Come on Sonny, let's get on home.\" Copper shakily stood up and, with tears still streaming down his now soaked face, walked off home without making any eye contact or saying goodbye. Chief was almost speechless. He never understood how much Tod meant to him until his death, and was not expecting this sudden change of character. Before leaving, the wolfhound turned to face the foxes, \"I'm truly sorry 'bout that Vixey. We'll see yea tomorrow again.\" \"No! Copper, I'm coming!\" Tod shouted and screamed, trying to call out to his friend, but his efforts were fruitless as the spirit world wouldn't allow him. He could hear and see everything around him, but could not be seen or heard himself. \"Copper, I'm here! I'm here,\" he said as he ran towards his best friend. His own tears forming from the sight before his eyes. He hated the fact that his friend was still affected by his death; let alone being unable to do anything about it. Although he knew Copper couldn't hear him, he always tried to get across. His mother was right behind him as he closed in on his friend, who was curled up in his bail, crying himself to sleep. \"I'm... I'm sorry it ended like it did,\" said Tod's mother, \"He may never forget you, but over time, it will become easier for him to cope.\" Tod never took his eyes off his friend, who by now, had become quiet and was about to call it a day. Without looking away, as a tear of pain fell onto the grass below him, he softly whispered, \"I will find a way to talk to you, mark my word, I will.\"[Chapter 2] (Authors Note: Hi all. I would like to thank you all for the reads. Unfortunately, I have year end exams, so I will not be able to update until the end of November, but I hope that I make it worth the wait. Once again, the original story line belongs to jerod2447 and i have been given permission to post this. I hope to one day make this a re-write and continuation, but that would take some time. Please review, I thrive on them.) \"Goodbye may seem forever. Farewell is like the end, but in my heart is the memory and there you will always be.\" Walt Disney The night air grew cold and darkness had descended onto the farm. Vixey remained outside, staring at the path her friends had taken home. Copper's outburst affected her on multiple levels. She had somehow been able to lock up her thoughts of her beloved mate, but now, those doors had been forced open from the flood of tears her friend released. The vixen lowered her head silently and remained motionless as the dams which had built up in her eyes had now burst. Minutes past, which felt like eternity to the kits surrounding her. Sky began to worry. She had never seen her mother so emotionally destroyed before, and it was obviously starting to take its toll on her siblings. She raised her head and made an attempt to break through the wall which separated her mother from the rest of the world, \"Mom, are you alright?\" the older vixen started noticing more, but was not entirely out of her trance. The young vixen then moved into her mother's line of sight and had one final attempt to reach her, \"Mom?\" Vixey shook her head, she was not entirely free, but she was free enough, \"I-I'll be alright. Come on, let's go eat.\" After supper was accounted for, Vixey had made an extremely difficult decision. She led her kits to Tod's old basket, which had become a sacred place and was not touched since his death. Although she was quite reluctant to spend this time where her mate had laid his head at night, the need for his love outweighed the the price of his lasting memory. As she set her first paw in the basket, her eyes started watering at the long missed, unique scent of her mate. As the kits climbed in one by one and lay their little bodies against hers, Vixey felt a lump catch in her thought from the memory of many love filled night Tod had spent with her. Once everybody was in and settled, with Fyre sitting on one side, they fell asleep one after the other. Throughout the night, Fyre was restless. His mind was concocting up all the scenarios his imagination could allow, all of which took place at the waterfall. Then, all of a sudden, his body shook violently and he found himself wide awake, panting heavily and in emotional pain. He was used to waking up like this, but something seemed different. He quickly climbed out of the basket and ran to an open window. Once he managed to squeeze himself through the gap, he headed off to the place he knew he would not be found, the waterfall. Once the waterfall was in sight, Fyre slowed his pace down. He came to a dead stop just shy of the water's edge. His emotions started taking over and soon, tears had escaped from his eyes. As the tears rolled down his face, he set his gaze at the fallen tree that lay across the waterfall. Even though the porcupine's answers were not very detailed, it still allowed him to dream up a scenario similar to his father's death, but one huge difference, in the bear's place, was his uncle Copper. With tears of pain still streaming down his face, he found a cave at the waterfalls edge, where he fell asleep and dreamed revenge. \"Fyre! Fyre!\" Bolt, Lily and Violet shouted in an attempt to find there missing brother. The sun had now come up again, but Fyre was not home. Not one soul had seen or heard him leave. They all knew he liked his alone time, but he had never left so early was at the edge of her patience and was now becoming worried.\"Have you found him yet?\"she asked as her kits scurried around. Before they had half a chance to answer, Copper rounded the corner with little Tod right behind. \"Vixey, what's going on? Is everything alright?\" Copper asked the worried vixen once he found her. \"Does it look like everything is alright?\" Vixey snapped back at her friend. She was obviously not in the best of moods, yet she regretted her sharp response. The kits were too pre-occupied to hear her unhappy tone, but the bloodhound was all too understanding to care. Once Vixey had calmed down, she continued, \"Fyre is missing. We were supposed to go into town today with Widow Tweed, but I don't want him to arrive home to an empty house.\" \"Go, I'll wait for him. He trusts me enough to believe me when I tell him where you are,\" Copper sighed softly, raised his head to meet the vixen's eyes, with his mind still under the illusion that Fyre doesn't know. Vixey looked the bloodhound straight in the eye, \"Well, I wouldn't count on that. I saw him standing by the porch last night, and I'm not sure how much he heard. So be careful.\" \"Come Vixey, come kits, its time to go,\" Widow Tweed called out to the scrambling family of foxes. \"I have to go now, thanks again, Copper,\" The exhausted kits soon found their mother, and walked with her to the car. Vixey, being the oldest, got to climb on the front seat, while her kits had to settle on the load deck. They were soon on their way, leaving Copper to wait for Fyre.[Chapter 3] (Author's Note: Hi all. First off, I would like to thank Salexes for Beta Reading this for me, even if I didn't change as much as I should've. But, never the less, the next chapter is here. In the last chapter, Vixey had to find a way to deal with Copper's outburst, so she and her kits spent the night in Tod's old basket. well, when I say her kits, Fyre couldn't sleep and ran off to the waterfall for the night. the next morning, Vixey and the remaining kits leave for town, and ask Copper to keep an eye out for them. This is what happened next.) \"Life is too ironic to fully understand. It takes sadness to know what happiness is. Noise to appreciate silence and absence to value presence.\" peltonen27 Once the widow's car vanished from Copper's sight, he decided to wait a few minutes in case Fyre decided to come back. As the hound lay down, he began to take a deeper approach into the advice his friend had given him. How long was he watching us? How much had he heard? Would he be forgive me if he had to find out? Fyre slowly peeled his eyes opened as a new day burst into the small opening of the cave. His sleep may have been little, but his plans were big. Today he would see his uncle get he deserved. He slowly stood up and exited the small cave, his fur all scruffy from the long restless night. He couldn't remember all of it, but just enough to know what Copper had done. Throughout the sleepless night, Fyre managed to conjure up a clever plan. Fyre knew how close the train tracks were, and if what his mother told him was true, he knew just how dangerous they could be. He would somehow have to convince his uncle that one of his friends is trapped and then keep him there long enough for the train to come thundering down the tracks. But before he could finish revising his plan, a deep growl from behind him snatched his attention. Expecting it to be his mother, fuming with anger for leaving without consulting her, Fyre slowly turned around. His heart was ready to burst and an apology on the tip of his tongue, but his soft face was met with the gaze from a pair of wild eyes stuck to the body of a mountain lion. Fyre screamed on the top of his lungs. The thoughts plaguing Copper's mind were suddenly brought to a hold when the sound of a high pitched screech covered the valley's stillness. \"Fyre,\" he whispered to himself as soon as his ears stopped ringing. He instantly got up onto his feet and ran off to the tracks. Fyre stood motionless, unable to move as the beast inched closer and closer. The young fox shrunk down into a ball, trying to council himself from the lion, but he knew it wouldn't last. The sudden realization of his plan being evaporated into thin air ripped him back to reality. The lion grinned at the ball of fur in front of him, almost as if to mock his futile attempts. The lion then pounced. (Please don't kill me if this fight is not up to standard, it's my first EVER fight scene) Fyre shut his eyes and waited for the inevitable, but it never arrived. The sound of a heavy thud and ensuing scuffle was enough to erg Fyre to chance a peak. Once the dust had settled, he was able to take in the confusing site before his eyes. The mountain lion now stood a reasonable distance away, crouching and ready to attack. Between it and the fox kit, taking defence, was Copper. His hackles raised, drool dripping from his fang like teeth. Fyre was unsure of why his murderous uncle, who killed his father, was protecting him. All he knew was that the train tracks could be pinned against him, but this on the other hand couldn't. It was his first encounter with a mountain lion, and he was unsure of it's strength, but his size and build pinned him as a worthy advisory. The fox kit also saw this as a brilliant time to find cover. He slowly backed into the vegetation, his eyes not braking contact with the lion. The lion noticed this and took a chance at chasing him. He darted in the foxes direction, only to get blocked off by a snarling hound. Copper tried to take a bite of the lions paw, only to have his shoulder squeezed between it's jaws. A sharp jolt of pain ran down the hounds leg, causing a howl to leave his muzzle. The lion let go an tried to take a more deadly attack, when the hound turned his head around and closed his jaws on the lion's windpipe. Using all the strength it's weak body could muster, the lion stood up and flung Copper a fair distance away, causing the hound to land on something sharp and round. Then, the unmistakable sound of a trigger mechanism filled the air, followed by a shriek of pain from the hound. He had landed and triggered an old bear trap, causing it to clamp down on his upper back leg. Copper screamed blue murder as the trap continued to force itself closed, drawing blood as the rusty, razor sharp teeth sunk into this leg. He clenched his teeth, trying to distract him from the pain, but it was useless. The hound looked at the area where he had seen Fyre disappear. He stopped his crying just long enough to shout out, \"FYRE, RUN!\" The mountain lion had found his feet again and had caught it's breath again. Once Copper saw the lion had regained it's strength, he knew he was done for. The wild beasts stare sent a cold shiver down the hounds spine. The lion pounced... (Author's Note: Sorry if this chapter came out shorter then the rest, and I really want to apologise for the cliff hanger, but I couldn't help it. Please follow/fave and, even better, review)[Chapter 4] (Author's Note: Hi all. I have put my other Fox and the Hound Fanfic on hold to finish up this one. Last time, Copper was saving Fyre, but was doing it at the near cost of his life. Will he survive? You'll have to read further to find out. Warning! Sad scene ahead) \"Everything comes with a price. You can never gain something if you don't sacrifice anything of equal value.\" Author unknown Copper lay on the ground, hopelessly watching the mountain lion glide through the air at him. The hound knew his time was up. His injured state would not allow him to defend himself for long, but he didn't care. He made Vixey a promise, \"Vixey, I know that sooner or later one of the kits are going to find out and they may lose faith and respect for me, but I will never let them get hurt. Even if it kills me,\" and that was all he needed to do, he would fight till his death. As soon as his paws hit the ground, the lion went straight for the neck, trying to finish off the hound. Copper attempted to lift his paws and get a hold of his attacker's neck, but his efforts were futile. The beasts positioned himself and bit down on his previous marks, this time, drawing a substantial amount of blood as the teeth sink deeper into his skin and shutting off the airway. Copper wheezed as the life was being drawn out of his exhausted body. His muscles became lame and his eyes began disappearing behind their covers. Mere seconds away from Copper's death, an explosion of bright light blinded the expecting lion in the open. The lion released it's tight grip from the hounds neck and growled in defence as he stumbles around, dazed from the light. Copper lay on the ground, his eyes shut, not allowing to do much more then add discomfort to his vision behind the lids. Fyre's eyes were shielded buy a fairly large leaf. The lion's eyes allowed nothing to be seen but bight white, he was blinded. Then, he was hit on the side of his body by a small but powerful animal, sending him crashing to the ground with a heavy thump. A loud painful roar escaped the lion's muzzle; he had no idea of his surroundings or the animal he was facing. Once he managed to get up onto his trembling paws, instead of attacking, he turned tail and fled, tripping a few times as he left the area. The light faded slowly as the lion fled the area. Fyre watched as the light died down and once he was satisfied that it had become less blinding, he peered his head through a gap in the vegetation, and noticed the light had settled around a smallish animal, a familiar looking animal, a familiar looking fox. He had seen the fox in one of the pictures Widow Tweed had stuck to her mirror. In the picture, the fox had a collar on and was looking at the photographer and smiling with a cake below him which said, \"Happy Birthday, Tod\". He had asked his mother various times who the fox was, but she never replied. Suddenly, one and one added up, the fox must be his father. But what he witnessed next confused him to no end. There the fox stood, a warm orange glow surrounding him, looking at Copper on the ground. Once the mountain lion's growls were too faint to hear, the fox nuzzled Copper's face. \"Copper. Hey, wake up,\" The fox's unique voice managed to stir Copper slightly. The hound slowly opened his eyes and stared at a face he thought he said his final goodbye to. \"Tod?\" Copper weakly asked with a small cough as he stared at his best friend. His eyes started watering at the sight of the glow around Tod. \"Yeah Cop, its me\" Tod said as a smile appeared on his face. For so long, he had been trying to get through to the family he never had, the friends he never had and the most loyal hunter you could ever wish to be friends with. And now, he was finally able to retch trough to his friend in the time he needed help the most. \"Am... Am I dead?\" Copper asked as he stared Tod straight into his deep eyes, \"or is this just another dream?\" The reply he got caused, the now formed tears, to roll down his cheeks, \"No, this is very real.\" Tod then took a more detailed look at his friend, finding the source of his pain. The bear trap was clenching hard on his leg, allowing blood to seep out the infected wound. The fox then decided to test out the theory of having no pain in the afterlife, and attempted to open the old trap. Placing his paw under the hound's leg, he somehow managed to squeeze between his friends leg and the trap. This only caused more pain as the top half began to dig deeper. Clenching his muzzle on the top piece, Tod found the strength to open the trap just enough to allow the hound's leg to slip out, allowing the trap slam together with nothing in it's path. Copper's open wound began to bleed more rapidly as the cool morning air brushed over the cuts left from the bear trap. Instead of asking if his friend was alright, Tod lay down next Copper, licking and trying to clean the wound, allowing Copper to catch his breath and process what was happening. The forest had become quiet, almost too quiet. Aside from Copper's heavy breathing and the sound of the waterfall, everything was deafeningly silent. Copper was unsure of what was happening. He had watched his friend at death's doorstep. He started thinking, \"How? How is this possible? I... I saw him d... I can't even think about the word. Is this even possible? I just wish this was real.\" Tod had a few thoughts of his own, \"I can not believe this is happening. It seems like forever since I saw him Break down, even though it was last night. I wonder... I wonder if he would forgive me. If Vixey had to see me, how would she react? If I ever have the chance to meet at least one of my kits, I would not let go. I've seen how Frye reacts to my absence, and I've also seen glimpses of his evil thoughts. I just hope I get the chance to set things straight, before Copper actually ends up dead.\" Copper's more relaxed breathing and lowered heart rate had notified Tod of his best friends more relaxed state. Once the bleeding from Copper's leg had subsided, the fox shifted his body higher to met the, face to face with his long lost friend. Tod sat up and sat right next to the hound's face and stared down at the bruised face. Looking him deep in the hound's dark and watering eyes, she softly said, \"Copper, your my very best friend.\" The river building up in Copper's eyes had burst, allowing streams to roll down the hounds face and he replied, \"And... And your mine to, Tod.\" The fox began tearing up at his best friend's response, remembering how they made this exactly the same as the moment they made the promise, \"And we'll always be friends forever, won't we?\" Copper looked up into the foxes deep eyes, allowing more tears to roll down both faces. He knew this would be an important moment in their lives, and so, the injured hound slowly began to sit up, being cautious about the wounds on his leg. He shifted into a comfortable position and placed his head next to his friends, and recited the word's he would remember until the day he dies, \"Yeah, forever.\" The two took a moment to allow the waves of sweet memories to flow in, not realizing that they were not alone. (Author's Note: So, that must've been different, yet I wonder what will happen next. Please don't leave without reviewing, I like to read input on my stories so I know where to go next.

A huge thanks to all the faves/follows and an even bigger thanks to X25Z56 for the PM.) \"Sometimes, all you need is a second chance, because time was not ready for the first one.\" Evil-Copper As the pair of long lost friends stayed in each other's embrace, the past began to flood in. A past which proved that the two of them didn't care what the rest of the world said. The tears flowing down their cheeks brought back the multiple times the pair swam with one another. The absolute joy of being together one again reminded them of the countless days in which they would play until either one of them were being called home. The love which had always been between them had not faded in the least, was now stronger then ever. Nothing could've ever separated Tod and Copper, except for what was soon to come. Fyre watched the pair in amazement. His father and his his father's 'suposed' killer now sat before the young fox kit, shedding long suppressed tears from the months of pain. Fyre wasted no time in deciding to confront the pair in front of him for answers. But, before he managed to take a step, a shadow came running past, heading straight for Tod. A heavy thud filled the air as the figure collided with Tod, sending the pair rolling while a shocked Copper could only watch. The rolling pair soon came to an abrupt stop against a tree log, sending another crashing sound into the air. The dark figure was on top of Tod, still unaware of who he was, until a booming voice escaped it's mouth, \"How dare you hurt the closest friend I have!\" It took Tod mere seconds to recognize the voice. It was one he would never forget. \"Vixey?\" He asked just for confirmation. The vixen slowly backed off and into the sunlight where her body was revealed. \"Tod?\" She asked in complete disbelief. Her mate, until recently, no longer existed in the living world. And yet, he stood in front of him. She knew it was not real, but she couldn't shake the fact that she had hit him, felt him and heard him. Her mind was too busy trying to wrap around the fact that her beloved mate was there to say a single word. All she could do, was bring her body right up against his to feel his warm embrace. \"Vixey, it's alright. I'm here now,\" Tod said trying to comfort the crying vixen he once called his love. The one fox that would forever remain in his heart. The sweet long forgotten scent she had seemed to shed even more tears from the male fox. There embrace could be felt throughout the nearby area as the pair softly sobbed in unison at the unexpected reunion. As sweet as the moment was, it was without it's faults. Now that Tod's spirit was alive, they seemed to completely forget about the injured Bloodhound, who sat less then a few meters away from the couple intertwined in embrace. Although he knew that this was an extremely special time for the two foxes, he was in pain. He somehow managed to suppress his pained whines until the pair split up. Soon realizing that Copper was in a poor state, they immediately turned to face him. As the pair came closer to the hound, Vixey could take a better look at the wounds. Little time had past since he was rescued, yet his wounds seemed to be healing well. The teeth marks were now barely visible. The one on his leg however, remained in all it's pain. \"Copper, what happened?\" Vixey asked, taking a particular note of the bear trap marks on his hind leg. Copper looked at Vixey, unsure of whether he should say anything about Fyre. He knew what he had to do though, if she didn't hear it from him, she may hear it from her kit. \"You left for the market with the widow, and I waited for Fyre. He did not show up. Then I heard a yelp as if someone was in trouble, and I guessed it was Fyre. So, I set out after him.\" \"I soon found him, close to the waterfall. There was just one problem...\" \"Which was?\" Vixey asked curiously. \"He was cornered by a mountain lion. I saw him, looking into those hungry eyes. It leapt for him, but I knocked the lion away from him. While we fought, Fyre slipped away. Then the wild animal flung me onto one of the master's old bear traps, and I don't think I have to tell you what happened with that. Then a white light exploded, chasing the lion off.\" \"And from that light, I saw Tod,\" Copper said as he turned to face his long lost partner. \"He helped me out the trap. And now, here we are.\" This made Vixey worry for her kits fatherly figure. he had never encountered such a horrific story surviver, so in all fairness, she didn't know how t react. Was she meant to remain worried over her friend or was she supposed to be glad and praising the heavens above? She had no idea. \"Where is Fyre?\" Vixey asked curiously. She may have been taken aback by her mates sudden reappearance, but that would never stop her motherly instinct to worry over her young ones. \"Here I am,\" the small fox kit said as he left his hiding place.

Her heart found some relief in knowing that he was alright, but her anger had not been spared. The idea of him running off remained fresh in her mind as something didn't seem right. His sudden disappearance sparked something inside of her which she could not hide. Although the young kit seemed intact, his soul was torn, separating from his mind in order to find some type of indication which would prove that what the porcupine had said was true. However, no such clues would be shown here. As he slowly inched closer to his parents, his heart began to pump quickly, trying to serve his mind in finding an excuse for running off, but it was of no use. He knew he would have to tell them the truth soon, and instead of trying to formulate a story which he would struggle to convey, his mind decided to come clean. \"Fyre, are you alright?\" Vixey asked as she kept her eyes glued on the mall ball of red fluff slowly making it's way to her. \"I'm fine,\" he replied quickly, not lifting he's head to meet his mothers tearful eyes. \"I'm alive, am I not?\" Vixey snapped. Her short fuse may have been long enough to help her calm down during the inevitable confrontation, but with the young fox kit's ungrateful and continues attitude, her fuse simmered down to the point where her mind could no longer support itself with the heavy load of stress. \"OKAY, LISTEN UP! You have no right to talk to me like that! What has gotten into you? Ever since you and your siblings ran off to the waterfall, you have changed, and I want to know why?\" Fyre's small paws tensed as his anger seemed to overwhelm his mind, forcing his claws to dig into the ground. His mind was made up, all he had to do was ask them for the truth, for he knew he would finally be told the truth, either from Vixey and Copper, or from his father. \"I am tired of hearing excuses. All of us; me, Sky, Tod, Bolt, Violet and even Lily have asked you to tell us what happened. But what do you do? Ignore us. Tell us he died saving Uncle Copper from a bear. But what lead to his death?\" He looked over to his father's spirit. \"I want the whole truth.\" (Author's note: Hi all, I know this is short, but I have had some time to think and, with the help of my friend, This will be the end of this part of the installation.

His father, Fred Newendyke, was his hero for doing so. He also was a cop. In little Freddy's eyes, that was the closest a human would ever come to being a superhero. And it was good enough for Freddy. Every day when his father would come home, Freddy would sit in front of him, listening with wide eyes to the stories the officer would tell him.

R because they said fuck so much. And holy shit, I wrote something! I promise not to try not to fuck with your mind Promise not to mind if you go your way and I go mine Promise not to lie if I'm looking you straight in the eye Promise not to try not to let you down… - Eve 6, Promise I. I told the dumbass to go home. Even before he lost a finger, before he had to shoot anyone, I told him to go home. Harry was convinced that he and Harmony were Meant To Be, and he'd been trying to figure out what to do with himself. That was a process that Perry had enjoyed watching from a slight distance, because even without his priors, Harry hadn't been officially employed in five years, according to the full background check Perry had run. He'd found all of Harry's mug shots. Five of them, in total. The first was young, too young, and it held the faintest smirk. The ones after, though, were annoyed. The last looked… Indifferent. Weary. It was the expression of someone who no longer imagined anything better. Perry kept them in a folder he could glance at, occasionally, and didn't want to admit to himself exactly why. His police contact had said guy's a loser. Steal the chair out from under ya. Watch your back. Perry had told Harry quit stealing shit. You're not a punk. Harry had looked so touched. Perry was a goddamn good judge of character. Hello, gay detective? Harry could be trusted. He needed some direction and someone to pound some sense into him, and Perry had already vowed not to be the one who did it…but he couldn't quite walk away, either. He didn't have the distance he meant to. II. He watched Harry go through the glove box in his car again. The kid had done it just like the first time, when they'd been on stakeout. Like he had every right to, like there was nothing weird about it. It looked like OCD bordering on ADD and a bunch of other fucking acronyms, but Perry was too world-weary to do more than recognize it for what it was: survival. The notion was solidified in spades the first time he'd let Harry into his house. The kid had essentially cased the place. Evaluating his environment that openly and thoroughly was nothing short of the actions of someone who no longer worried about what anyone thought about it; he was simply doing what he'd learned to do, for safety and personal gain. The fact that he was so obvious about it made Perry worry about him, because it screamed one of two things: amateur or someone who no longer cared where it got him. He knew Harry was better at his 'trade' than that, so the act had to be borne of long practice. Harry looked at him with large, dark eyes and a smirk, and the combination screamed hey I'm such a clueless moron, I can't possibly be up to anything, and Perry suddenly got it. \"You bastard,\" he said. \"Stay out of my shit.\" Harry shrugged and looked so innocent that it wasn't hard for Perry to believe that others would buy it. He, after all, had not done much to keep Harry out of his glove box in the first place. It had seemed like the meanderings of a bored, silly creature with no direct harm in mind. Cunning little oddball. Better actor than he'd let on. \"If I can't trust you,\" Perry said suddenly, \"I can't keep you around.\" That hit some kind of button, because the gaze that turned on him then was the kind of unmitigated worry that couldn't be dredged up that fast; Harry was not that kind of actor. Perry got a glimpse of the truth, for a moment, and it was full of hope and need. Whatever Perry meant to him, right then, was in his eyes and Perry knew he had a hold over Harry that Harry flat out could not control. \"You can…\" Harry paused, nearly stuttering, hands waving, and Perry waited. \"Keep me around.\" Perry smirked. Not dumb enough to insist that Perry could trust him. That was progress. III. Once Harry was well out of the hospital (a good three days after Perry had made it home), the three of them had celebrated surviving Christmas with a bottle of tequila on the beach near Harmony's. None of them had wanted anything to do with bars or other people, just to bask in the moment with each other, something Perry normally wouldn't have participated in. He hadn't been able to help himself. Harmony and Harry together were like a tumble of puppies, funny and cute and vaguely stupid when they'd been drinking, just happy to exist and happy with each other and happy with him for some fucking reason. So he'd gone along just to see what would happen and to keep either of them from drowning. Moonlight, flashing off water and eyes and teeth; giggles and splashing and over enthusiastic stories told from two separate viewpoints. Harry was genuinely funny as often as he was unintentionally funny, and Perry had to laugh at them both. Happy people usually set his teeth on edge, because being happy meant not really knowing what was going on, being too goddamn dumb to realize what was really happening around them, how bad ( badly? Badly's an adverb, who taught you grammar ) …things really were, and could be one moment to the next. Happy meant a lack of self-preservation. Harry was shit at self-preservation, and Harmony wasn't much better. Red flag number one…six, twenty four, for whatever the fuck it mattered, came when a fairly drunk and sleepy Harry had planted himself in Perry's lap in the sand and tucked his face into his neck. Stupidly affectionate. Harmony, a linen closet of sheets to the wind herself, had cuddled in to one side and wrapped her arms around one of his. Perry had been too warm and comfortable to shove either of them off, choosing instead to make half-conscious motions with his fingernails along Harry's back, making him shiver. His little friend from back East was not a two beer queer, by any means, but he was more malleable than even he realized, and the girl he knew only fractions better was confused as hell about what she was capable of. Luckily, even as much of a self-professed bastard as he was, Perry had more than enough self-preservation for all of them. Perry. Tell Harry one thing you admire about him. Harmony's idea of a drinking game, only a month later, when it had become apparent that Harry was not going home. He'd rolled his eyes dramatically, downed his shot, then spent a moment looking at the ceiling as if trying to think of something positive about Harry might cause him a migraine. He was getting electrocuted via his balls, but he kept telling the guy to go fuck himself. Most people would have been begging and screaming, and…well, he did scream, but he didn't devolve to little-girl screaming, and there was no begging. It was actually kind of… He'd raised his eyebrows a little. I don't know anyone else who would have held up like that. And it had been true. Harmony's face had lit up and she'd bounced a little in pleased glee. That's so…aw. Aw, Harry! Harry had been staring between them in amazement. And then there was the whole thing with shooting Dexter while hanging from a coffin over the freeway. Perry had added that almost against his will and had figured it was the tequila. I didn't believe it at first but there were traffic cams on the goddamn overpass and it was all recorded. One of the most fucking amazing things I've ever seen. Harry had looked at him for a moment with such adoration in his eyes that Perry couldn't look away. He could get used to that, get mildly addicted to the worship… IV. \"What's this?\" There's nothing demanding in Harry's voice. Perry took a moment to wonder yet again if it was because he didn't want to know, or didn't expect an answer. Perry didn't say anything, just gestured Harry inside. He chose Harry's gun and ammo and waited while it was processed. He didn't expect anything to really be answered by whatever happened next, but it would be interesting at the least. Harry kept shooting him looks but took what he was given, donned ear and eye protection when required, and stared out at the target that Perry pointed him to. \"Go ahead, Chief,\" Perry said, raising his voice to be heard over the other shooters and their own head gear. Harry gave him another look of concern and confusion, but then he also shrugged and looked at the target. There was nothing, absolutely nothing, about Harry's stance that spoke of training or even practice when he lifted the gun two-handed and took aim. He didn't even squint or drop his shoulders or act like he was trying to sight. His elbows, his shoulders, the way he braced his feet - it was all wrong, to the point where Perry almost decided he'd been wrong. Perry watched Harry absorb the impact of each shot with his arms and shoulders, each shot giving away his inexperience but also making his musculature clear. Harry was compact, tougher than he looked. Accustomed to impact . Perry stared at Harry until the gun clicked on an empty chamber. Harry had not been counting and had likely not even been aware of how many shots the weapon held. Everything he did told Perry volumes. Perry hit the button to reel in the target, keeping his eyes on Harry the whole time. Harry still looked mildly confused, maybe a little uneasy, and was rolling his shoulders to wind himself down. Perry looked at the target with open indifference once it came close enough to examine. It was everything he feared. Harry had put five shots into a very tight radius in the center of the target. He looked at Harry almost indulgently with an audible sniff even though his heart was pounding. \"So who taught you that?\" Harry put the gun down on the counter as if he just didn't want contact with it any longer, wiping his hands on his thighs. \"Um…no one. I never took lessons or anything.\" \"Harry,\" Perry said with thinly veiled impatience. \"No one,\" Harry said quickly. \"I don't even like guns. I just…\" He trailed off for a moment, then gestured at the target without looking at Perry again. \"I don't get what the big deal is. Just point and shoot, where you want it to go. Like a camera.\" Perry wanted to laugh, but didn't, because even more than humor he felt a thrill of…something disconcerting that he wasn't immediately able to identify. Amazement, disbelief, confusion. His own little idiot savant, heavy on the idiot, naturally brilliant at something that did not come naturally to anyone. It worried him further that he had so readily added his . \"Let's get Harmony and go do something,\" he said. Harry was all grins after that and damn near forgot Perry's weird intensity, the shooting range, all of it. He not so nonchalantly caused them to end up at a nearby bar, ordering a couple of rounds for the three of them and waiting until Harry was a little looser, a little sillier. \"Darts, Chief?\" he said. \"I don't even play,\" Harry said. \"Sure you do,\" Perry said, gathering up a couple of sets of well abused darts from the red plastic cups resting precariously on the edges of the countertops near the electronic boards. \"Loser buys the next round.\" Harry glanced at Harmony, who wiggled her eyebrows at him. Harry, even tipsy and playing things up to amuse Harmony, hit everything he aimed for. Every single time. There were hoots and laughter from first Harmony, and then the people playing at the machine to the right of theirs, and then from the whole damn bar. Perry made them leave before they could become a debacle. \"That was nuts,\" Harry said, leaning into Perry in the parking lot and laughing, clinging to Harmony as he did it. \"Is there like, a circuit or something I could join? Like poker? We could totally be rich.\" \"No, Chief,\" Perry said, and instead of feeling vindicated, he just felt stunned. V. Perry was listening to Dabney go on about something - again - and was wearing his marginally polite, yes you are socially powerful and I hate career suicide so I'm tolerating you look. Harry was dutifully familiar with it, and hated it, mainly because Perry was faking it. It was one of the reasons he took so much verbal abuse from his boss and friend; it was the real Perry most of the time, caring about him by flipping him shit. That was still an overreaction, but always better than the full mask. Perry was mainly about contradictions and appearances in front of other people. Harry watched for several minutes, there but not, unacknowledged. Dabney had given him a cursory once-over on the way in and had not recognized him. Harry contented himself with mentally sizing up the table, the items on it, and his proximity to it. Dabney lapsed into something political, his tone indicating he was pleased with himself for being so damn smart. Harry rose, ignoring the warning glance Perry shot him, and chose an open side of the table. The grip was just slightly different - nine and a half fingers - but the mechanics were all the same once the edge of the tablecloth was in his hands. It was only a matter of the right angle and tension, like so many other things in life. It happened so fast that neither man at the table had time to flinch. Harry whipped the tablecloth off, leaving everything else intact and undisturbed, right down to the crumbs from Dabney's scone. Dabney openly gaped at Harry as he folded the tablecloth over one arm. Harry didn't dare glance at Perry. \"Magic,\" he said softly, and walked away. Perry never said anything about it. Two days later, Dabney called and said he had a walk-on part in some sitcom for Harry. Harry barely repressed a moment of preening. \"It better not interfere with your real job ,\" Perry said. Harry shrugged. VI. Harry stood in the bathroom doorway and watched him for a long moment, and for once, Perry didn't snap at him to fuck off. \"Why cover it up?\" Harry said. \"It makes you look, maybe, badass or something. I mean, more badass than usual.\" Perry ignored the insinuated complement and kept tapping foundation over the remnants of the black eye without looking at Harry in the mirror. \"Because it also says 'maybe lost a fight', dumbass. Bad for business.\" Harry cocked his head back in consideration, something Perry wished he could remove from the idiot's repertoire. \"Well, actually, it's trying to hide it that says 'lost that fight',\" he said. \"The guys who are looking to say 'you should see the other guy' wear it around proudly.\" Perry stopped what he was doing to whip his head around and fix Harry with a look of annoyance. \"What the fuck do you even know about it?\" Harry cocked his head forward until he was looking at Perry from below, mouth twisted into something that said really, idiot? No, Harry couldn't fight, as he'd both admitted and graphically demonstrated when Perry first met him. \"Lost more fights that you can count, Slick ,\" Harry said. \"So when I occasionally pulled one off? Goddamn right I wore it around.\" Perry looked back at the mirror and realized he was going to have to reluctantly concede to Harry, for once. He paused, then grabbed a towel and began to remove the makeup. Harry, to his everlasting credit with Perry, didn't smirk; he looked proud when Perry glanced at him. VII. Harry was fidgeting so hard in the store that Perry was afraid he was going to bring security down on them by virtue alone. Recognizing the signs of impending ingrained behavior, Perry said, \"Don't you dare .\" \"What?\" Harry said, already looking guilty. \"You go sit in the car, or go outside and smoke, or anything but fucking start shoplifting,\" Perry said. \"I'll kill you, and that's not a threat. It's a guarantee.\" Harry looked so wide-eyed lost for a moment that Perry found himself actually choking down a moment of pity, for fuck's sake. \"Out,\" Perry said. \"Seriously. Go wait by the car. I'll be out in a minute.\" The shame he caught a glimpse of in Harry's eyes before the kid could shut down and turn away made Perry grip the handle of the shopping cart with a force that whitened his knuckles and made his hands ache. Harry was a creature of impulse and survival. He was a career thief, and as wrong as that was, it wasn't Perry's place to judge or question. It was his place to keep his own ass from being arrested because his new roommate couldn't fucking control himself. However, the sudden realization that Harry was doing it as a kneejerk reaction was sobering. A thousand small moments connected in Perry's memory that would have been obvious even to someone without his detective's mind and skills. Harry, nervous and twitching, watching anyone who came within feet of him with a barely suppressed suspicion. Harry, smoking instead of making personal contact. Harry, hands clenching into tight fists rather than reaching out. Eating meals like he had no idea where the next one was coming from, flinching like he expected every motion to become a blow, wide eyes sweeping every space he walked into. Arrested, five times. No serious prison time, one stint of 10 months. Still, Perry had no idea what that ten months had consisted of, and Harry had been living on the edge a long time even on the outside. He had one serious fuckup on his hands, without knowing how it had started after Harry left Indiana, of all fucking places, idiot small town boy ending up fencing shit in New York. One silly Midwesterner with five priors still acting like a goddamn rube, trying to fucking save moths out of pools and girls from creeps at parties and trying to give him CPR in the middle of the street. One street kid with no fucking street smarts. There had to be something nearby that he could slam his head against. Send him back, to Indiana or New York or anywhere, Jesus. \"But,\" Perry mumbled aloud, \"…he'll be dead pretty soon after because his life skills are shit but he can't watch other people suffer.\" Underneath was something beautiful and capable; he knew it when he saw it. He'd let it slip by one time too many. He stood in the bread aisle and debated, knowing he was already screwed, hating himself for it and hating Harry just as much. Because they both had a decent streak. And the world really had no response to that except to kick you until you were finally down for the count. He cursed under his breath and left the cart, just left it, and headed for the parking lot. Harry was next to the car, smoking, shifting his weight from foot to foot, eyes darting around like he was waiting to be assaulted. Perry whistled to get his attention. Harry looked at him and then seemed to try and make himself smaller, for fuck's sake, like Perry was on his way to kicking his ass. \"You can't smoke in the store,\" Perry said when he was close enough. Harry looked at him with open confusion, squinting his eyes a little while he visibly tried to parse the statement. \"Come back in,\" Perry said, dropping his shoulders. \"I shouldn't have tossed you. Just promise you won't palm anything. You don't have to, anymore.\" Harry had flipped the cigarette to the asphalt halfway through what he was saying, stepping on it automatically without dropping his eyes. His gaze was wary but hopeful, rife with disbelief. Perry had never spoken to him that way, not since saying you're not a punk in a hospital hallway. Perry had the terrible suspicion that no one had ever spoken to Harry that way. It wasn't his problem to fix, and he was already soured enough on the world and humanity at large to try to convince himself he didn't give a fuck. But. There was just something there, something he wasn't quite jaded enough to turn away from. Harry seemed to be thinking about it. As if Perry's words carried actual weight. Then his expression changed, turning from wary to starving . Those big, dark, liquid eyes shining at him like he was part of making sure the world turned. Perry was ruined, and he knew it. VIII. Harry did everything he could to make Perry proud of him. Even when he was annoyed to the point of telling him to go fuck himself, Harry was bent on not disappointing Perry. Perry broke Harry's deep seated urge to steal by planting things around the house. Candy, gum, cigarettes. It seemed counter productive, like he was rewarding the behavior, but once Harry caught on, it became a game. He pick pocketed Perry on a daily basis, and Perry pretended it wasn't happening. It never occurred to Harry to freak out as if he was being humored, and that was why Perry decided to keep him around. He was grateful that Perry was trying. The reason Harry didn't freak out was because Perry had been right: Harry was not a punk. There was nothing in him that dictated he lash out over being caught, over being offered an alternative to behavior even he knew was wrong. \"I can't help it,\" Harry said one afternoon, out of nowhere. Perry picked up on it and knew immediately what Harry was referring to. \"I know, Chief,\" he said. \"You can't anymore, though.\" \"Why didn't you just threaten me?\" Harry said, and the confusion in his voice was genuine. \"Because that's what anyone else would have done,\" Perry said. \"I'm not anyone else. And it wouldn't have worked.\" After a pause, Harry said, \"I know,\" and he said it with such a reverence that Perry knew it which part of that conversation he was referring to. \"Why don't you teach me how to pickpocket, then?\" Perry said. \"I don't know how the fuck you're doing it, and it's pissing me off.\" Something changed in Harry's face for a moment, something far beyond pleased agreement. Something mildly feral and aroused. Perry was looking forward to every moment. Checking and finding his pockets empty at the end of every day was both satisfying and frustrating. He'd watched and listened and cataloged, waiting for tells and signs. He counted the number of times Harry had been close enough to do something, and they just didn't add up. Not yet. He was missing something. Something Harry could teach him. \"I'll slow it down for you, then,\" Harry said. And Harry proceeded to torture him. Perry had no doubt that Harry didn't realize how maddening he was being; Harry didn't do subtle except, apparently, with his hands while stealing. Every time he came near Perry for the next few days, he started exaggerating his movements. Whatever he came near for in the first place stayed the same speed, with Harry yammering on like usual and making the same amount of eye contact. He didn't bump into him clumsily or try to distract him; didn't drop things or otherwise flail around. This was Harry completely focused and wielding a talent. Perry learned several things. One, he let Harry well into his personal space far too often, closer than anyone else. He allowed Harry to obliterate that invisible bubble he lived in most of the time. He was hard pressed to remember exactly how long it had been since he'd trusted anyone enough to get away with that. That of course, led to the worst realization. Challenging Harry to reveal his technique became a test of his own restraint; Harry gave away what he was doing by purposely touching Perry every time he did it. Long, clever fingers brushed against him just fleetingly anywhere he was hiding something, sliding between his jacket and shirt to get at the pockets in the lining. He had managed to do those things before, just without making noticeable contact. The noticeable contact, however, was driving Perry insane. \"Usually I interrupt you when you seem to be thinking the hardest, or right in the middle of something,\" Harry said casually from far too close. \"It annoys you, and you waste all your attention on getting pissed, and waving me off. Then I make it worse by doing something you hate, something buddy-buddy, like hitting you on the shoulder or pounding you on the back.\" Harry demonstrated by standing off to one side and thumping Perry on the back with a closed fist, using the other hand to dart into an outside pocket. \"You do touch me a lot,\" Perry said. \"You touch me more,\" Harry said. \"And those are the times I get the rest of whatever you hide for me to take.\" Perry froze and stared. Harry misinterpreted the look and withdrew his hands quickly, tucking them in his own pockets. \"I'd never take anything you don't want me to,\" he said. \"No,\" Perry said. \"I know that. That's not what worries me.\" He was screwed. He'd already known that; he just hadn't realized the level he'd reached. The lesson ended on an unsatisfying note for them both, for entirely different reasons. IX. \"Jesus H Christ in a sidecar chariot,\" Perry said, but it was oddly without venom. \"They know what they're doing. Leave the invertebrates alone.\" Harry was pausing along the sidewalk periodically to pick up worms and place them in more dirt-laden areas. It was causing their stroll around the neighborhood to become a lengthy endeavor. \"They'll dry out or get stepped on later,\" Harry said, as if it was the simplest thing in the world. \"This is how nature works, Harry. I can't go for walks with you if you're going to – \" Perry stopped short of stating more of the obvious. He was berating Harry for being…Harry. \"Try and save the world,\" he finished with a sigh. No point failing to call it like it was. \"You love me just the way I am,\" Harry said, trying to pick up another worm, bitten-short nails scraping on the concrete. \"You're hopeless,\" Perry said. \"Worms have five hearts,\" Harry said as if Perry hadn't spoken. \"Five. And if you cut them in half, they grow into two worms. Can you imagine if that happened to people? I mean, would it be a twin, or what? How the hell do you deal with that? 'Hey, this is my brother, he exists because when we were in a car accident, I was cut in half'. That would be crazy. How the hell would health insurance even deal with that, how do you figure out who – \" Perry shoved a hand into Harry's hair, cupping his head and gripping just a little. Harry seemed soothed, and deposited the latest worm onto a patch of dirt before glancing up at Perry. \"Just the way you are,\" Perry said. X. It took Perry a little while in his off time to figure out who Chook Chutney was. He didn't bother questioning himself as to why he cared; he simply counted it as part of his overall background check on Harry. That was all. Probably. Chook's real name turned out to be Chuck Cameron. Football team, varsity, typical Midwestern cornfed Disney farmboy complete with blue eyes and blond hair and the smartass grin to go with it. The high school yearbooks featured him fairly prominently, including one with him with an arm around a painfully young Harry's neck. The twink factor was off the scale. Perry actually found himself feeling appreciative for how far the kid had gone in trying to broadcast how gay he was without having it printed on a t shirt and fucking a teammate in the middle of the field during halftime. Mispronouncing his own name into Aussie slang for chicken, easily translated as 'cock', and… well, chutney , for fuck's sake. Bi enough to sleep with Harmony…but, Perry had to admit he wouldn't kick her out of a threesome, either. Harry, making sure Perry knew that Harmony had promised Chook would be the one person she would stay away from. Refusing to sleep with her all these years later because she had not. Perry let it all sit, tucking it away as one more tidbit that would eventually show him the entire picture. He waited until Harry had food halfway in his mouth one afternoon. \"You should forgive Harmony for sleeping with Chook,\" he said. Harry half-inhaled a mouthful of sandwich and spent a few moments wheezing his way back. \"Wha?\" \"The only reason you were upset about it in the first place was that you didn't want there to be a them that left you out.\" Harry got pale and wide-eyed. \"She friend-zoned you, because she needed you to stay that one safe guy she didn't mess up. But he was yours first.\" Harry's color returned, and he stared at Perry a moment longer, then shrugged and went back to eating. \"You're the detective,\" he said. Perry decided he already knew everything he needed to. XI. And one to grow on: There are those moments when Perry wonders if he should just encourage Harry to go, to disappear wherever he wants to. Harry is good at that, and it has let him get away with so much before. Survival. In fact, if Perry had thought it was Harry's best chance…he would have let that happen. But it wasn't, anymore. The kinds of things Harry was into, because of Perry…they didn't lend themselves to the kind of life where someone could run back to the streets and pickpocket or shoplift or whatever, and survive. Harry had a target on his back, by then. \"Chief?\" Harry swiveled his head to look at Perry. Automatic, most of the time, to make eye contact, to make any kind of connection. \"Stay here, with me. Stay in the extra room. Keep me distracted enough to rethink the shit I do.\" Harry kept staring, but there was something in his gaze that let Perry know the kid was All In. Finally, Harry said, \"You can do the same for me.\" ","Summary":" You Should See The Other Guy ©2014 gekizetsu Ten ways Perry and Harry fall in love and don't mean t"},{"Movie":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang","Title":"Hospital Visit","Author":"j'adore macabre","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8666067","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Short scene that just came to me. I refuse to believe Perry would be wheeling around to go see Harry after a bullet went through him . Harry wiped sweaty palms on his sweat pants. His hands trembled as he looked through the glass doors. To his right, in big bold letter, were the words \"Intensive Care\". Harmony's words echoed in his head. \" He's not doing too good.\" She said in a hushed voice as she sat at Harry's bedside, smoothing down his mussed hair. \"The bullet hit the top of his lung, the doctor said. He just got out of surgery.\" Bouncing on his heels for a moment, Harry steeled his nerves and, with a deep breath, went inside. He could not help but wince at the amount of machinery attached to the detective. The thief shuffled to his friend's side and pulled up a chair, careful of his own bullet wound. The sound of machines beeping unnerved him. \"Hey, Slick.\" Harry whispered, afraid to really wake him. \"Hell of a shot, huh? You're gonna get better though, teach me more detective stuff. Maybe I can get a real job and stop stealing shit.\" He hesitantly put his hand on the detective's, brushing his thumb over the knuckles. Perry's head lolled in Harry's direction, and his eyes fluttered open a crack. The left arm seemed paralyzed on the bed. He brought his right up weakly to move the oxygen mask. \"Hey, Chief.\" Perry croaked. He struggled to focus on the younger man. \"Still alive?\" \"Thanks to you.\" Harry grinned. \"Well, and Johnny Gossamer.\" \"Shit fucking book.\" Perry took too deep a breath and gave a soft cry of pain. He put the mask back in place and tried to peer beneath the collar of his hospital gown. \"How bad?\" \"It's nothing.\" Harry lied easily with false cheer as he gently pushed the blonde's hand back down. \"You'll be out before you can say fuck up.\" \"Fuck up.\" Perry mumbled weakly. His eyes drifted close, and Harry copied Harmony's action of smoothing down his sweat-dampened hair. \"Get some sleep. Maybe I'll bring you that whipped mocha frap shit you like.\" \"You're so gay.\" Perry breathed as Harry's thumb brushed the side of his face. The thief couldn't help but give a small laugh. \"Just for you, Slick. Love at first kiss.\" \"You…liked it.\" Perry leaned into the other's hand absentmindedly. \"It wasn't terrible.\" Harry replied in a hushed whisper as if sharing a secret. \"Great…we'll get fucking married.\" It came a strained laugh. Perry's brow furrowed in pain and beads of sweat began to break out on his forehead. \"That's the drugs talking.\" Harry rose to his feet. \"I'll leave so you can get some sleep.\" \"Stay.\" Perry's eyes struggled to open. \"Too fucking depressing here.\" \"Yeah, yeah sure.\" Harry replied as he quickly sat back down. He let out a puff of air as he rubbed the tops of his thighs, his foot bouncing. \"So…I was thinking, maybe—\" \"Harry?\" Perry muttered as he let himself drift back into a drug induced sleep. \"What? Oh, yeah, yeah I'll, uh, just…sit. Here.\" The younger man pressed his lips in a thin line as he watched. After a moment, he took a breath and intertwined his fingers with Perry's. Perry gave a weak squeeze and a soft sigh. ","Summary":" Short scene that just came to me.

Warnings : Language Hi. I abso-fucking-lutely love this fandom. I'm tearing my way through every available story I can find. And now, while half delirious on sleep, I'm writing stuff about it. Don't mind me . . . . Harry's driving left much to be desired, but Perry wasn't in a fit state to be picky and he settled for shouting only when Harry would glance over at him instead of the road. His leg hurt like a bitch. The stupid drug-dealing asshole had taken off right when Harry mentioned the boy's stepfather, which Perry had told him a million times not to do , and he and Harry were forced into an hour long foot chase through the city. It wouldn't have been so bad if not for the fact that the kid started climbing balcony ladders. For once it was Perry, not Harry, who took a fall and landed hard on his left leg. \"Harry, watch the damn lights!\" Harry yanked his gaze away, but it slid back all the same and Perry sighed, shoving his forehead hard into the palm of his hand. If this was how Harry acted when he got hurt, Perry was very thankful that the man had been unconscious during the worst of Perry's recovery last Christmas. He could just imagine a fleet of nurses having to steer Harry away from the surgery room every few seconds. \"I would like to make it home without any further incidents, you know.\" \"How's your leg? Are you in a lot of pain? Are you sure you don't want me to take you to the hospital?\" \"Jesus, Harry, you almost ran that lady over!\" Perry grabbed the panic handle and held on tight. \"Yes, I'm sure. I just want to go home. Besides, the hospital's on the other side of town and if I have to spend another twenty minutes in this car with you, I'm going to hurl.\" \"In your own car,\" gasped Harry, slanting his eyes to the side and attempting a smile. \"I'm shocked.\" \" That's how bad your driving is, dumbass, now eyes forward!\" When the house finally came into view, Perry let out a silent prayer of thanks to a being he didn't even believe in and finally released the panic handle. Perry didn't usually enjoy depending on people, but Harry was as harmless as they came and so eager to please that Perry didn't even pretend to not want help and leaned heavily on the other man until they made it to the couch. \"Alright, you wait there and I'll get some pain pills.\" Harry patted the pillows and brought him the remote, water, Advil, the works. Then he was knelt at Perry's feet and working on the laces of his shoes. \"You're a regular little housewife, Harry.\" Perry's head slumped into the back of the couch and he sank into the peaceful feeling of careful hands sliding along his foot, a thumb pressed just so on the underside of his ankle bone. God, this was domestic. Perry didn't do domestic. \"Only for you,\" said Harry and he set a palm against Perry's uninjured calf. Perry opened his eyes and looked down to see if Harry was smirking at him, but the only expression on the man's face was sincerity and Perry felt something like delight curl sweet and uninvited in his chest. Fuck, Perry could have punched himself. But he was already injured, so maybe he could indulge himself. Just this once. He set a hand on Harry's cheek and Harry turned into it, eyes closed. \"You get sweet when you're tired,\" murmured Harry. \"Yeah, well don't tell anyone.\" \"Like they'd believe me.\" \"Harry?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Can we blame this on the sleep deprivation later? Or the injury or the Advil or, fuck, anything?\" \"What? What are we blaming Advil for?\" Perry sat up, ignoring the pain in his leg and grabbed Harry's t-shirt to drag him forward. \"This,\" he growled and kissed him. Harry's mouth parted on a gasp of surprise and Perry drank it in, let himself adore the sweet taste of smoke on Harry's tongue, reveled in the rough scratch of stubble and the feel of having Harry close. Both Harry's hands had fallen on Perry's spread knees and Perry cupped his partner's jaw with both hands and pressed in closer, drinking his fill. If this was going to be it, he was going to damn well enjoy himself. Harry seemed to take his suggestion they write this off later to heart because he tilted his head and slid his tongue into Perry's mouth without an ounce of reserve. And, oh, but that made it better. \"Oh, Harry, Harry,\" breathed Perry on a grin and Harry said, \"Shut up, you're tired remember?\" while climbing onto his lap, careful to avoid the bad leg. \"Feisty,\" replied Perry, not sure why he was still talking. That was Harry's problem, not his. The damn New Yorker was rubbing off on him in more ways than one. Pun in-fucking-tended, thank you very much. Harry shut him up with another kiss and Perry got his hands around slim, stupid hips, up under his ratty shirt, and kissed back. . . .

Note(s): Dedicated to reflecting , forever my muse and inspiration. Bliss Giggle Perry hated it when Harry was put on painkillers. He was incredibly loud, talkative, and squirmed way too much. It was like the medication amplified every single one of Harry's most annoying qualities and then some. It was hard enough to deal with Harry when he wasn't under the influence of medicine; he already acted like an overgrown five year-old, after all. When the painkillers interfered with what little bit of common sense the other man had, however, Perry couldn't even use a bit of fear as a motivator to get Harry to behave. The blond couldn't decide which was more difficult: getting Harry into the car and safely home without incident, or figuring out what to do with him once he finally got the shorter man into the house. On the way home from the emergency room, Harry liked to play with the radio and turn it up loud enough that the bass made the entire car vibrate. Whenever Perry managed to swat his hand away enough for him to get discouraged, the brunet would take to playing with Perry's phone - at least, he used to. After he'd deleted half of the P.I.'s contacts, Perry had learned to keep his cell safely hidden - or entertain himself by distracting his lover. He would slump down in his seat and turn so that his cheek was resting against the edge of his seat, before giving the taller man a goofy grin and talking to him non-stop about anything he could think of. By the time Harry would become interested in getting more hands-on with distracting Perry, they were usually almost home. Once inside, Perry would guide Harry up to their bedroom. He would make up several excuses as to why he didn't need to go to bed, and each word out of his mouth sent Perry that much closer to losing his cool (To his credit, he managed to keep calm for longer periods of time when Harry was like that. It wasn't his fault, after all. Perry certainly could blame him, but that didn't seem very fair.) Harry would resort to whining and trying to shove the taller man away, both of which proved to be rather ineffective; drugged Harry or not, Perry was always determined to get his way. Most of the time, Harry would noisily complain as Perry helped him put on his pajamas, and by the time his head hit the pillow, he was fast asleep. Other times, however, things would go a bit differently. Like the night after they had finished dealing with a grumpy old man and his equally grumpy dog. That particular night had resulted in over five hours at the ER. As per usual, Perry had escaped their little misadventure with only a few cuts and bruises. The same couldn't be said for Harry. The poor man seemed to have a certain scent about him that the old man's dog didn't like and, before anybody had the chance to think, the animal had snapped at Harry, catching his arm. The bite wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been, but it bled like the dog had severed his hand. After x-rays, bandages, stitches, more painkillers, and an update on Harry's tetanus shots, they had been permitted to leave. The drive home had actually been quite uneventful. Harry dozed off at some point and only the sound of his quiet snores filled the vehicle. At their house, once Perry had gently woken the other man, they made it up to their room with little incident. Harry didn't seem interested in arguing that night, which Perry was incredibly grateful for; something about dog bites and the possibility of rabies just didn't sit right with him. The blond helped Harry into a pair of dark blue pajama bottoms before attempting to tuck him in. Before he could pull the sheet up, Harry's uninjured arm latched around Perry's neck and pulled him down so that they were mere inches apart. \"What are you doing?\" he demanded, trying his hardest to sound annoyed. The shorter man gave him a crooked smile. \"What's it look like I'm doing?\" \"... You cannot be thinking about sex right now, Harry.\" \"Mind outta the gutter, Per! Sex is the furthest thing from my mind right now. Well, okay, not completely true. The image of my grandma in the tub is in first place of 'Shit I'm definitely not thinking of right now'. Relax.\" He leaned up, mindful of his other arm, and quickly kissed the blond. \"I just wanted to make sure you weren't going anywhere fast.\" \"If you wanted me to lay down with you, you could've just asked, dipshit.\" Perry pulled himself out of Harry's grip and climbed over him, settling beside him. He draped his arm over Harry's waist and propped himself up on his elbow. \"Okay, now go to sleep.\" \"Not yet.\" \"Harry...\" \"Can't I just bask in our manly cuddling for a little while?\" Harry gave a triumphant grin when Perry's lips quirked upwards, \"Ha! You smiled, so you gotta be nice and lemme do what I want.\" He scowled. \"Ten minutes, chief.\" \"Fine, fine.\" The brunet closed his eyes and fell still. Just as Perry was about to pull away so he could get changed himself, Harry spoke up. \"So, hey, how come the dog didn't bite you? D'you think maybe it's something to do with the stereotype of how well gay guys treat their pets? Or maybe it's 'cause I was the one who had to dive into that dumpster so you wouldn't ruin your French shoes.\" Perry quirked a brow, hoping the smaller man would end up talking himself to sleep. \"Italian shoes, Harry.\" \"Whatever, they're kinda close to each other or something. Anyways, we're buying me something expensive so you can't just keep using that excuse, okay? You always make me shower afterwards, and that's getting annoying to have to keep that up, y'know? Yeah, I know I need to shower anyways, but having you stand over me and nag me like you're my mom or something is getting old. And you shower everyday anyways, so what'd be the problem with getting a little dirty first? Personally, I think you're scared of-\" Before he could say another word, Perry's arm moved in favor of tickling the other man, ripping a shriek from his lips. Harry couldn't shove Perry away; he was too busy laughing - giggling, really. The man giggled - to try. It went on for a few minutes, Perry effectively finding all of the brunet's ticklish spots, and Harry trying in vain to push his hand away while hoping to catch his breath. Only when his abdomen started to hurt and tears of laughter formed in his eyes did Perry stop. Harry took a moment to calm down enough to pout up at the other man. \"What'd you do that for?\" \"To shut you up. Time for bed, anyways.\" When Harry's response was to huff and roll over so that his back was against Perry's chest, the blond smirked. \"I never realized that tickling you would make you giggle like a little girl.\" \"... Shut up, Per.\" -…- Roses 'So, hey, me again. Y'know, the weird guy who keeps narrating his entire life story for you? Whoever you are. Anyways, Perry's outta the house at the moment so I thought now would be as good a time as any to update you a bit on all the shit that's been going down. And holy fuck, has some serious shit gone down in the past few days. We had a huge fight. I know, more boring relationship stuff. If it bothers you, take a hike, 'cause you know I'm gonna keep going on about it anyways. And, I know it's no big secret that we argue - well, no, we don't. We bicker . There's a difference in the two words, as Perry's smug ass self recently informed me. Anyways, yeah, we bicker. Seems kinda just how our relationship should work. We both love to complain, namely about each other. We know what buttons to push and which ones to stay away from (for instance, he doesn't call me 'stupid' and I sure as hell stay away from 'queen'. Seriously, I said it one time and the guy punched me in the arm! Thought it was gonna fall off, which would've really pissed me off 'cause it's the arm with five fingers still attached to the hand. I still dunno what the fuck it is with that word, he just isn't a fan of it, I guess. ... Oh, right, on with the point of the story). We can spend all day complaining and still go to bed without Perry having that annoyed twitch in his eye or me rolling over and turning my back to him - don't knock it, it actually fucking works with him. But when I say \"we had a huge fight\" I don't mean we argued for hours over who was supposed to wash the dishes or some shit like that. We actually had a fight . There was yelling - holy shit was there a lot of yelling - and we even shoved each other a few times. You know that weird vein-popping-out thing Perry can get on his forehead when he's really pissed? No? Well, now you do, congratulations. Anyways, I've never seen that vein so fucking big before. I swear he was about two minutes away from it bursting right outta his forehead and beating me to death with itself. That's some visual, huh? Try thinking about that tonight and then go to bed. Guarantee you won't sleep. Anyways, the part that really gets me about this whole fucking mess, besides Perry's murderous vein, I mean, is that the fight was all my fault. I really blew shit outta proportion, 'cause I'm a total fucking idiot and a crappy boyfriend - is that what we should call each other? What other words are there? Yeah, boyfriend works. But, before I get off topic (like that hasn't happened twenty times already. I know, shut up) it wasn't a big deal, the actual thing we were fighting about. Guess I should give you a bit of background on that, huh? Perry really is a sweet guy. He'd never admit it and most people would laugh if I told them, but it's the truth, okay? He definitely has his own way of showing it, but I understand him well enough to know when he's being a caring guy or just making jackass comments. Perry's way of showing that he cares is by berating me. Sounds fucked up, but that's just how he is. Whenever he's worried about me, he gets angry or annoyed or whatever, and it doesn't bother me anymore. His words are an outlet for all of his emotions, gay as that statement may seem. And the other day, I guess I felt like I was sick of it. Maybe I'm still not used to someone giving an actual crap about me, even if they have a fucked up way of showing it, according to some standards of normalcy in society or something. We were out on a case on some rich guy's property. We knew there was some security inside the house, but we didn't even think about the outside. There wasn't a fence or any signs or anything, so there wasn't a single reason to assume differently. We quickly found out there were a few guards that walked around the house at all hours of the night. Well, I found that out, after a big sonuvabitch knocked me out with one swing. I wasn't out for very long, I think. Not sure, 'cause when I woke up I was in Perry's car, and he was driving home with Mr. Vein stopping by for a visit. As soon as I sat up, he started venting. And god, when he gets going, it all seems to run together without him taking a breath...' \"What kind of moron lets a guy that fucking huge sneak up on him? It was totally quiet outside, how did you not hear him? I leave you alone for five goddamn minutes to stop you from whining about how you're 'ready to go solo', and this is the way you prove that to me? Jesus fucking Christ, Harry. You could've shot yourself in the foot and I would be more inclined to believe you're ready to go solo than what I am right now! Do you realize how many times you've been injured this year? I hope so, because I fucking lost count after February. It is not humanly possible to behave as carelessly as you do.\" Perry carried on for a few more minutes, and Harry let him. His head was pounding painfully where the large guard had hit him. He wasn't even sure where he'd been hit; it felt like the man had just taken a two-by-four and smacked him repeatedly until not a single inch was left unharmed. Perry's words seeped through the pounding somehow, and only added to Harry's growing irritability. He was already pissed off at himself for insisting he didn't need to be watched all the time, only to get attacked once he was finally alone. He knew Perry had just been worried, but it felt like the taller man was adding insult to injury. Something inside Harry wanted to just ignore the fact that Perry was simply letting off some steam with no offense intended. And ignore it, he did. \"Well, excuse the fucking hell outta me for not seeing someone wearing a dark suit in the middle of the night!\" Harry snapped as he clutched his head in his hands. Perry finally stopped his own angry rambles and glanced at the brunet. \"I mean, fuck , Perry. You may be able to keep an eye on ten different things at once and still pay attention to the job, but I can't! You've been doing this for how many years now? I've been here for a little over a year, so why don't you stop being such a fucking asshole all the time and cut me some slack, huh?\" \"'What the fuck are you talking about, Harry? I've done nothing but cut you some slack ever since you got here!\" \"Don't make it sound like you did me some huge fucking favor by giving me a place to stay and a job! We all know why you really did that.\" Perry shot him a glare. \"Do tell.\" 'Aaaand it all went downhill from there. I know I'm a jerk for cutting that short, but it wasn't my finest moment, accusing Perry of letting me live with him 'cause he just wanted to get into my pants. I know it definitely wasn't true, of course. Just one of those heat-of-the-moment things that you end up regretting with all your might later on. So, we fought for a couple of hours until we were both too tired to argue anymore. I slept on the couch, just to be safe, and lemme just say that that was the coldest, loneliest night of my entire life. I got up early the next morning and went out to think. I knew I'd been a complete dick, there was no question about it. I needed to figure out a way to apologize. Believe me, apologizing to the scariest person I've ever loved was not an easy subject to approach. Before Perry, I'd only ever been in relationships with women. That's all fine, but it didn't help much with thinking of a proper apology. Gay or not, men aren't women, which sucks 'cause I could've just gone on experience and had the whole thing figured out in like five minutes. Instead, it took me five hours, and I wasn't even sure if the apology would work or not.' It was late in the afternoon when Harry heard Perry's car pull up. He quickly glanced around the main floor of their apartment, wondering just what the hell he'd been thinking. Surely this wouldn't work. It was just too simple of an apology. Perry deserved more, and probably expected it, too. If nothing else, he would get more pissed off at Harry for making such a mess. Before the shorter man could think any further on the issue, the door slowly opened and Perry stepped inside, his back turned to shut the door behind him. He paused, as if sensing Harry was nearby, and spun around. The moment their eyes locked a large lump formed in Harry's throat, and he forgot the apology he'd rehearsed the entire day. It was hard to read Perry's expression; did his quirked eyebrow mean he was unamused or perhaps still upset? Maybe he hadn't expected Harry to be home and he was trying to keep himself from exploding again? Every table surface of the main floor was covered in a dozen roses, all of different colors. The brunet didn't even know if Perry liked roses, but it was a traditional relationship flower, right? He knew the colors were supposed to signify something, but he wasn't sure what and thought it best to just play it safe. In his hands he held a bouquet of red roses and, before Perry could say anything, he all but shoved them into the other man's hands. \"So, um, I got you some roses 'cause they smell nice or something?\" The blond snorted, causing Harry to panic a bit more. Was that a good \"oh you're being so adorably idiotic right now\" snort or a \"you've got to be kidding me, you fucking asshole\" snort? \"Listen, I'm really sorry, okay? I totally didn't mean anything I said, I was just pissed at myself and I took it out on y-\" The rest of his words were swallowed by Perry, who pressed their lips together in a firm kiss. \"You're sweet.\" Perry stated once he finally pulled away. \"I mean, you're a dumbass, but you're sweet.\" 'And that was that. Stupid expression, but whatever. We spent the last few days having make-up sex every night and let me tell you, that's some of the best sex I've ever had. Seriously, he's a fucking animal sometimes, I- Oh, shit, he's home. More on this later.' Perry walked up the stairs, mail in hand, to find Harry lounging at his desk. \"Dammit, Harry, are you talking to yourself again?\" \"I'm not talking to myself, I'm narrating .\" \"Whatever. You got a letter from Harmony.\" He tossed the thin envelope at the shorter man, opening his own bit of mail. \"Who'd you get a letter from?\" \"Geez, can't you recognize a credit card bill yet?\" \"Credit-? Oh, shit, Perry, don't open that!\" Harry lunged for the bill and tripped, falling to the floor, hard. Perry merely snorted and unfolded the bill, eyes skimming over each charge. His grip tightened on the paper when he reached the end of the page, and he shot a glare at the man who was trying to scramble up off of the floor. \"You paid for all of those flowers with my credit card? \"Uh... my bad?\" -…- Heavy Perry wasn't a self-conscious person, at least not openly. He wore confidence very obviously on his sleeve, and people could just tell that he knew he looked good. He knew he wore the best suits with the most expensive material, and that they complimented his body, and he knew his hair looked perfect without having to glance in the mirror. However, there was one thing that he was never sure of, not even slightly. He was fully aware of the fact that he was a tall man, and that his weight was nearly the perfect ratio for his height. However, that didn't stop him from worrying every time he ended up with a man who was significantly smaller than him. Harry was no exception. A voice would constantly pop up at inconvenient times, reminding him \"Hey, dipshit, Harry's not exactly the strongest guy in the world.\" And every time, Perry would hastily shift his weight, begrudgingly noting that the brunet's breath's had become increasingly shallow. It didn't matter what they were doing, either: making out, having sex, or simply cuddling. Perry was always looking for signs that his added weight was causing Harry distress and, much to Harry's discontent, was never on top of him for very long. Perry's constant movement to keep the majority of his weight off of the slighter man ruined a lot of what Harry liked to call \"moments\". They were cuddled on the couch watching a film in comfortable silence with Perry mostly blanketing Harry with his body? Like clockwork, he would move within a few moments. They were lying in bed making out or in mid-coitus? Perry would shift himself and totally ruin the angle they'd been working with so well. Whenever Perry forgot and they'd both finished, he was only distracted until he came down from his high. He would settle himself directly beside Harry and maybe nestle his nose into brown locks or perhaps rest his chin against Harry's shoulder. Either way, he would give the smaller man an apologetic kiss and drape an arm around his middle. Not that Harry minded, of course. It was all very endearing. The thing that bothered him, though, was the fact that such a thing was so strongly embedded into the confident, attractive P.I.'s mind. Quite frankly, Harry didn't understand what Perry was so worried about. Had he really never laid beneath a person who was taller than him or heavier than him and felt the comforting heat of being pressed between a solid body and a bit of furniture? It was a feeling that Harry had come to almost, sorta, really adore sharing with Perry. It made him feel inexplicably safe, as if the mere presence of Perry's warm, heavy body reassured him that the blond would always be there to watch out for him. It pissed him the hell off when Perry would take that away from him. He'd promised himself to keep quiet about the issue. It obviously bothered Perry and he didn't want to call the man out on what was sure to be a touchy subject. Instead, Harry often opened his mouth to protest, barely catching himself before babbling on about some silly thing. When the look of desperate concern was gone from Perry's face, replaced with a slight, adoring smile, the brunet would finally relax. He couldn't rest otherwise, no matter how tired he was. One night, Harry decided that enough was enough. He would get that feeling from Perry and he would ensure it lasted longer than a few pathetic seconds. He deserved that, he figured, and would gladly give up his remaining fingers to enjoy it. Fortunately for that particular night, they were both in a bit of \" the mood\", too tired to do the actual deed, but interested enough that a decent macking session would do the trick. Everything went according to plan. Harry had insisted that they watch a film in bed - on the television he'd managed to convince Perry to put in the bedroom - and cuddled up against the taller man without a second thought. Before the first five minutes of the film had passed, their lips were locked and struggling to taste just a little bit more of the other man. At some point, neither of them were exactly sure when, Harry had rolled onto his back and tugged at Perry until the blond finally conceded and laid on top of him. Immediately, Harry stopped fighting for dominance and allowed Perry to do as he wished. Dominating the session wasn't on his agenda that night, after all. He was going to keep Perry blanketed on top of him for as long as he liked. Harry could hardly breathe. Never mind the tongue down his throat; the heavier body covering his own knocked a bit of breath out of him in the most wonderful way. He didn't even bother trying to regain control of his breathing, convincing himself that it would just ruin the overall effect. He wrapped his arms around Perry, holding him as close as possible, reveling in the sensation of sinking just a bit further into the mattress. The smaller man's chest worked to keep that slight bit of air constant in his lungs, and it didn't take Perry long to realize. He started to pull away, causing Harry to frown into their kiss. The brunet held him even tighter, hooking a leg around the larger man's for good measure. There was no conceivable way he would let the blond off the hook so easily. After minutes of struggling to pull away and stay together, Perry finally broke the kiss, the only thing he seemed to have control of at the moment. \"What the fuck are you doing, Harry?\" he demanded, his voice a confusing mix of lust and concern. The slighter man gave him his most innocent smile. \"What d'you mean, Per?\" \"Don't play dumb. You won't let go of me.\" \"That's 'cause you're trying to move, duh.\" \"Of course I'm trying to move, idiot!\" Perry grumbled. \"You can barely breathe.\" \"I'm breathing fine.\" He quirked a brow. \"Really.\" \"Yes! I just so happen to very much like you being on top of me.\" Harry's smile grew, just before he pressed a quick kiss to the other man's jaw. \"It's a nice feeling, y'know?\" \"Oh, yeah. I totally enjoy almost suffocating under my boyfriend.\" The reply was dripping with sarcasm. \"At least I'm enjoying myself, instead of worrying so much about the guy beneath me.\" Harry sighed, \"Just... let it go, Per. I dunno who the hell made you feel bad for being a perfectly normal weight for a guy your height, but they can go fuck themselves. I like you the way you are. And if you don't stop trying to not suffocate me, I'm going to talk all the way through the next musical you decide to torture me with.\" Perry snorted, kissing Harry just above the eyebrow. \"You already do that, idiot.\" \"Well, I'll try to stop if you knock off this bullshit idea you got in your head.\" \"Deal.\" Harry grinned, running nine digits over Perry's back, his grip loosening just a bit. After a moment, he chuckled. \"I just realized Mr. I-don't-like-labels just called me his boyfriend.\" \"Shut up, chief.\" -…- Laundry It was very rare for Harry to willingly do chores around the apartment. A majority of the time, Perry either had to yell at him to get anything done or he ended up handling things on his own. It had been much simpler, he realized, when he was living on his own. He picked up after himself and didn't let dishes pile high in the sink until literally every utensil in the kitchen was dirty. Harry, on the other hand, didn't seem to see a point in picking up after himself - \"You're gonna make me go back and 'clean it properly', anyways!\" he'd protested on several occasions - nor did he see a problem with leaving dirty dishes untouched for days at a time. Perry knew he could be a bit of a clean freak, he just didn't see the harm in asking Harry to clean the occasional plate or vacuum up the messes he somehow managed to make. Late one evening, Perry came home to the usual clutter Harry tended to leave in his wake. There was no visible sign of where the shorter man might have gone off to, the blond noted with a sigh as he walked into the main room. He paused, trying to use the last bit of his energy to deduce what the brunet may have gotten himself into. His head titled as he heard a faint buzzing coming from the laundry room. Reluctant to find out what sort of mess he would find in there of all places, Perry quietly made his way to the small room. He stopped in the doorway, spotting Harry standing in front of the dryer - ' holy shit, he was doing laundry'. Before Perry had the chance to make even the slightest sound of disbelief, Harry pulled out a dark fleece blanket and, without hesitation, hugged it to his body, reveling in its warmth and clean scent. He stood there for several silent moments, a tiny, goofy grin playing at his lips. Finally, Perry stepped up behind him, wrapping his arms around the shorter man and holding the blanket firmly against him. Harry nearly jumped out of his skin. \"Jesus Christ, Per! Do you have to walk through the house like a fucking ninja all the time? What's your deal, anyways?\" The tall man smiled as he pressed a slow kiss to Harry's neck. \"You know I can't resist your being adorable.\" ","Summary":" Rating: PG to PG-13, just to be safe Fandom: Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Characters/Pairings: Perry/Harry W"},{"Movie":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang","Title":"Tidak Lebih, Tapi","Author":"honeyf","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7834962","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: Kiss Kiss Bang Bang bukan milik saya.

Happy reading~ Aku tidak yakin apa yang kulakukan waktu itu. Yeah , apa yang kulakukan, sih ! Berbuat sesuatu yang akhirnya membuatku menjadi seonggok sampah. Sial! Kalau aku tahu begitu akhirnya, aku tak akan membuat itu. Oh, well , aku bohong, aku sudah tahu ending- nya akan jadi seperti itu. Dan, aku tetap melakukannya. Yeah , tetap berlaku seperti orang bodoh. \"Ah, sudah mendidih.\" Semua itu dimulai dari saat aku menemukan satu buku resep dari raknya. Sial! Waktu itu aku sedang lapar, dan dia sedang keluar dengan pekerjaannya itu. Artinya, tidak ada makanan di rumah, dan aku juga tidak punya duit untuk itu. So what jika aku menahan laparku dengan menatap makanan-makanan yang ada dalam buku resep itu. Tak ada larangan buat itu 'kan? Yeah , aku pun menikmati aneka gambar makanan di sana. Tunggu! Pause sebentar di saat aku membuka satu halaman yang sudah membuat datangnya ide konyol masuk ke dalam kepalaku. Ide yang hanya dimaksudkan 'bagus' untuknya. Namun, 'buruk' untukku. Memang siapa dia, sialan? Hanya seorang yang suka mengataiku bodoh dan idiot. Tidak ada bedanya dari kedua kata itu. So, kenapa aku melakukan hal bagus untuknya? Sialan kau! Kau membuatku semakin bodoh saja. \"Habis itu, diamkan. Oke.\" So , sehari setelahnya, aku sibuk mengumpulkan sisa uangku—Oh, tadi kataku tidak punya duit , ya? Hanya tidak punya uang untuk membeli makanan. Setelah dipastikan terkumpul, aku pun membeli bahan-bahan yang diperlukan, tidak banyak. Sebenarnya, aku bisa saja mencurinya – seperti kebiasaanku dulu . Tapi, mengingat kata-katanya yang memintaku untuk tidak mencuri lagi, membuatku berpikir untuk sekali ini saja, aku benar-benar membeli apa yang kumau. Semua itu hanya karena dia, dan benar-benar untuk sialan dia. \"Tunggu! Sialan! Sudah tenggelam! Sial! Sial!\" Yah, tapi tetap saja aku berakhir dengan menghabiskan waktu di dalam dapur itu, berusaha untuk menghasilkan yang bagus. Setidaknya hasil yang bagus itu, nantinya bisa menahan kata 'idiot' dari mulutnya itu. \"Harry! Kaukah di dalam?\" Sial, itu dia! Menggangguku di saat aku butuh konsentrasi buat benda sialan yang ada di hadapanku sekarang. \"Harry, buka pintunya! Kenapa kau kunci, sih !\" Kemudian, dia membuat keributan dari pintu dapur rapuh itu. Menggedor-gedornya tanpa perasaan. Oke, aku bohong lagi, itu bukan seperti dia. Dia hanya berusaha membukanya dengan gagang pintunya. Tentu, itu bukan cara yang efektif, karena jelas tidak akan terbuka karena dikunci. \" No !\" \" What ?\" \"Aku tidak memperbolehkanmu !\" \" WTF ? Apa yang terjadi, sih ! Apa yang kau lakukan di dalam? Jangan berbuat macam-macam, Harry!\" \"Aku tidak berbuat macam-macam.\" \" So , what ? Buka, Harry! Aku butuh makananku.\" \"Cari di luar saja!\" \" What ? Oh, jadi sekarang kau berani mengusirku. Mengusir dari rumah sialanku ini. Begitu, Harry!\" Yeah , dia mulai marah. Terdengar dari nada suaranya yang semakin meninggi. \" Sorry , hanya saja aku tidak bisa sekarang, please , Perry.\" Brengsek, apa yang kulakukan dengan suaraku barusan. Itu bukan aku. Setelah aku memohon, ralat, maksudku berkata seperti itu, suara berisik dari arah pintu dapur tadi menghilang, apalagi dengan suara Perry. Ke mana dia? \"... well , terserahmu.\" Oh, itu dia. Dan sekarang, aku yakin dia pergi setelah berkata begitu. So , kembali dengan kegiatanku tadi, oh, sial! Sampai mana tadi. God , aku tidak tahu. Sial! Aku harus kembali melakukannya dari awal. Sialan! -HHH- \" So , apa yang kau lakukan kemarin malam, sampai-sampai baru pagi ini kau benar-benar baru bisa muncul di hadapanku?\" \"Aku tidak berbuat macam-macam seperti yang kau bilang kemarin, aku cuma membuatkanmu sesuatu.\" \"Sesuatu?\" \"Ini.\" Aku pun menyerahkan benda yang sudah susah payah kubuat itu kepadanya. \"Kuharap kau menerimanya tanpa berisik. Aku sudah susah payah membuatnya, tau. Jadi, kalau itu benar-benar buruk, kuharap kau lebih baik diam saja, tak perlu mengomentarinya. Tapi, kalau itu baik, kuharap kau menghargainya, dan berterima kasihlah padaku. So , cobalah itu.\" \"...\" \"Kenapa? Aku tidak akan memberimu racun.\" \"Bukan begitu, Harry. Aku cuma sedikit penasaran, kau memberiku cokelat di Valentine ini? Hanya untukku?\" \"Yeah, memangnya kenapa? Tidak ada yang salah 'kan? Kau sudah menampungku di sini, memberiku tempat tinggal, makanan, juga pekerjaan. Aku hanya ingin berterima kasih padamu. Dan lagi, kau sudah kuanggap sebagai sahabat terdekatku. Tidak ada yang aneh dari situ 'kan?\" \"Pacar.\" \" What ?\" \"Bukan sahabat, tapi pacar.\" \" What ? Aku tidak bermaksud begitu, sial! Aku ini murni straight. Aku hanya memberimu cokelat sebagai tanda terima kasih, tidak lebih.\" \"Kalau begitu, kau salah hari. Coba perhatikan, kau bilang tadi, kau sudah susah payah membuat ini. Biar kutebak, kau membeli semua bahannya, menghabiskan waktumu di dapur untuk membuatnya berulang kali sampai bisa mendapatkan hasil yang bagus. Kemudian, karena kau terlalu berkonsentrasi dengan otakmu yang—kau tahulah sendiri, sehingga aku seperti pengganggu yang harus disingkirkan. Dan akhirnya, kau mendapatkan hasil tersebut lalu tertidur tanpa sadar di mana kau berada. Paginya, tepatnya baru saja, kau keluar dari sana tanpa membersihkan dirimu—kupastikan juga kalau dapurku belum kau bersihkan, atau kemungkinan besar masih kacau berantakan. Datang menghampiriku, memberiku cokelat, memintaku untuk tidak berkomentar macam-macam atas cokelatmu. Cokelat di Hari Valentine. Dan, tidak sadarkah kalau kau membuat cokelat dalam bentuk hati ini? Hanya menunjukkan kalau kau seperti seorang perempuan yang ingin kekasih lelakinya memakan cokelat buatannya.\" Terlalu tepat. Ya, lihatlah itu. Aku, di sana, hanya bisa diam dengan penjelasan a la detektifnya itu. Brengsek sekali dia. Membuatku tidak berkutik seperti itu. Dan, tunggu! Aku bukan perempuan! Seperti yang kubilang, aku ini straight , aku masih laki-laki, aku masih menyukai perempuan. Ya, aku bukan gay seperti brengsek itu. \"Aku benar 'kan, Harry?\" Lihat lagi, tingkahku menjadi semakin konyol. Kenapa aku jadi gelisah seperti itu? Tidak bisakah kujawab dengan tidak , sialan. \"Baiklah, biar aku coba?\" \"... bagaimana?\" \"Tidak buruk, ini enak.\" Oke, itu cukup. Aku... tidak tahu mau berkata apa lagi. Sial! Kenyataannya dia masih membuatku seperti seorang idiot. End. A.N: Hanya cerita singkat~ Makasih lagi buat kaasan yang (lagi-lagi) ngebetain fic sumi ini.

Some rich guy, whole bunch of shit stolen or something like that. Harry wasn't exactly paying attention when Perry was telling him about it, to busy watching the latest episode of Hell's Kitchen and stuffing his face with potato chips. It isn't until after Perry forcefully pushes his feet off the coffee table and hauls him to his feet that he realizes what's going on or at least he's pretending to know what's going on. Something about a guy name Jerry? Or Maybe it was Michael? He doesn't have the slightest clue and he isn't about ask Perry to repeat himself because Perry really fucking hates when he does that. But the case itself really isn't what is important, or well it is because without it Harry would have never fucking realized he's beginning to get a little more than attached to his fellow detective. There's plenty guns and running. Lots of name calling and Perry asking if he's lost his fucking mind, which by this point he's sure he has because Perry is a fucking guy. A guy with a dick and he's not gay. He likes girls. Boobs, Pussy. The whole package. In fact he's got more than one pin-up in his room and a whole lot of other shit hidden away underneath his bed with a carton of cigarettes. He's suppose to be trying to quit smoking. He's not, but he told Perry he was to get the man off his back and maybe save himself a slap in the back of the head. Apparently there's higher changes of lung cancer and a whole other shit problems, but he kind of needs them right about now. Fuck. Does that mean Perry cares about him too? He's pretty fucking sure that it does, except he's called a moron more than not. Then there is the fact Perry keeps saving his ass and lets him live in his house and play detective with him even though he's pretty terrible at it. He would said he was a better thief, but he was pretty terrible with that too. It's one of the reasons he's got priors in a few other states. Fuck this is all really confusing, isn't it? And he just needs to think. He boots it upstairs and into his room before Perry can even ask him what he wants on the celebration pizza, slamming the door behind him. His fingers glide over the controls of his speakers, fiddling until the sweet sounds of Bon Jovi fills the air. Living on a Prayer doesn't exactly fit his situation. Then again it does and fuck even his own playlists are against him now. He struggles to throw off his hoodie before sinking down to his knees and pulling out his secret stash. He took the batteries out of the fire alarm months ago the first time when he lit up and the damn thing beeped until Perry came running and caught him red fucking handed with the cigarette dangling from his mouth. He isn't looking for a repeat on the lecture or the 'Jesus Fucking Christ, Harry' that's going to come with it. In fact, he's looking to avoid Perry all together. Harry throws himself onto the bed flicking his lighter until the sweet taste of nicotine feels his mouth and nostrils. His head leans back against the headboard, silently counting the tiles on the ceiling until he can actually fucking breath again. Think again. What the fuck is he doing? He's /not/ gay. Fuck. He's up on his feet again, underneath the bed again digging through his collection of dirty magazines. Jugs. Playboy. Busty Asians. He's not even sure why he bought some of this shit. He picks out the August Playboy. The centerfold is to die for. Not to mention the girl on page seven. Perfect rack, nice size and they'd probably fit nicely into the palms of his hands. Girls. Boobs. Pussy. He's flipping through the pages as he settles back onto the bed, flicking his ashes into a cup of water on the bedside table. Normally he's not this damn perverted. This damn needy, but he needs to know if he's broken. If this is actually a 'thing' or if it isn't. He's a little more than revealed when he actually does feel his dick getting hard. He takes a long drag from his cigarette, breathing it out through his nose as he slowly reaches to undo the button of his jeans, pushes down the zipper. He's wearing boxers underneath because it's a really fucking bad idea not to. No idea when someone is going to grab him again and attach a car battery to his balls. Once in this life time is enough, but if it does happen again he still wants to look fucking decent. His head falls back again as his warm hands wraps around his cock. He wishes he had some lube, something to make this whole fucking process easier. But then again he really should be downstairs getting ready to eat pizza with Perry. Instead he's upstairs jacking off. Really fucking great, Harry. Fucking perfect. The magazine has reached the centerfold when a loud knocking at his door catches him off guard or well a better way to describe is scares the fucking crap out of him. His hand jerks away from his cock in an instant, almost like it's a hot eye on a oven. The cigarette drops from his lips and onto his shirt and fucking Christ that fucking burns. He's tripping over his own pants as he tries to put out the orange bud, a thud echoing as he hits the floor. \"What the fuck are you doing in there, Harry?\" \"Uh, Nothing. Hang on.\" He pushes himself upwards to his feet, hopping as he tries to pull his jeans back over his hips. Buttoning them hastily before throwing open the door, leaning against it with his best innocent grin. The one that Perry never fucking buys. \"Hey there, Perry…Pizza here yet?\" He can literally fucking feel the other man's gaze as he looks him up and down. That stern 'I don't even know what the fuck you're up to' look clear. He can smell the smoke. Harry knows he fucking can because he hadn't had the time to febreeze the fucking place to hell or cut on the ceiling fan. He doesn't say anything about it. Thank Fucking God. \"Fucking disgusting, Harry. Really? Zip your pants and wash your goddamn hands before you come down…I don't want to taste your dick when I'm going for another slice.\" Harry nods his head quickly, agreeing. \"Yeah. Sure. No problem.\" Perry turns to leave, already on the first step before he pauses and turns around. \"And, Harry…\" \"Yeah?\" \"Don't take all fucking night.\" He doesn't breath again until Perry's downstairs again. His mind just as clouded as it ever was because fuck. This was so fucking wrong and he was straight. He isn't gay except now, but now he can't get the imagine of naked Perry out of his head. He hasn't even seen the other man's cock and he's picturing it. Imagine what it looks like, tastes like, feels like. He sinks back into his room because shit he's going to need a few more minutes. There's something fucking wrong with him because the thought of Perry has him harder than before. There's something wrong with him, really fucking wrong with him because he shouldn't be jacking off to his best friend. \"Fucking great, Harry…\" he mutters to himself as he stretches on the bed once again, hand wrapping back his aching cock once again. This time he doesn't even try to pretend that he doesn't want Perry. He just gives in. He comes with Perry's name on his lips, his forehead caked in sweat. When he does join Perry downstairs, he tries to pretend that nothing happened and everything is fucking hunky-dory. Whatever the fuck that means. Fuck. He has a thing for Perry. This is just wrong. Now he just has to figure out what the fuck he's going to do about it. There isn't exactly a book for these types of things or maybe there is. He doesn't fucking know. What he does know is that he's screwed and he kind of wants to be screwed. Fuck. He better just eat his fucking pizza and quit thinking about all this shit.

Nothing Harry is involved in ever stays easy. Plus, both Harry and Perry are so in denial that it can probably be seen from space. Harry/Harmony, Harry/Perry, minor dubcon btw Harry/OC. Same rating and behavior as the film (meaning gratuitous violence, h/c, language and kissing). FYI: the Avenues are a gang that have been present in Glassell Park since the 1950s. There's your obligatory trivia for the day. R, 18,000 words. He knew enough to go looking for Harry about an hour in. They were four months out from the crazed bullshit at Christmas that had turned life on its ear, and Perry still wasn't sure how the fuck things had been turned around to the point where he not only had a roommate/errand boy but hadn't killed him yet. Getting his new sidekick used to the scene was still a struggle, since Harry just flat out didn't fit in, and that was both a detriment and a relief. If he was going to have one at all, Perry didn't really want a sidekick who was as goddamn fake as everyone else he came in contact with on a regular basis. Harry may not have been capable of being fake. That, sadly, also led to the detrimental part, because while the kid had a gift for details and could remember almost anything said to him, he couldn't lie properly to save his life and couldn't really blend in with the local set. They were things he'd need to be proficient at to go on living in that part of California, to stay near Harmony, to be in the goddamn PI business. So Perry brought him to these damn parties and gave him nonexistent chores. Harry had to watch and report on random people without getting caught. Who were they talking to, what were they talking about, what were they drinking; he needed to pick up impressions on who they were, learn how to observe and absorb. Street smarts weren't good enough to get by on, anymore. So far, Harry had received another beat down of medium severity after jumping to some drunk girl's defense, had been thrown out of two other places for accusations of stalking , and had narrowly avoided yet another beating from someone's jealous significant other because he just didn't seem to understand subtlety . Perry hadn't blown his own cover on the first beating, because the idiot was in no real danger, and he needed a better idea of what Harry needed to work on as far as fighting skills went (blocking, mostly, and getting his weight behind any blow he managed to sneak in). Also, he needed Harry to understand that he couldn't save the world, possibly couldn't save anyone, ever . That would likely never stick, but Perry was hoping the world itself would beat it out of him eventually. The second beating didn't happen because the other guy was significantly bigger than Harry, and there were weapons involved once the guy destroyed a chair and decided to use its legs to introduce a little blunt force trauma. Perry's gun trumped chair legs any day. The total loss of his own higher brain functions when he'd seen the guy wrap one hand around Harry's throat and raise the other to pummel a chair leg into the kid's skull was new, though. He was genuinely beginning to care whether anyone hurt Harry. That would usually have been enough to get him to boot the guy out, anywhere away from him, and pretend they'd never met. He thought about it daily . Then the little shit would begin to babble about something, eyes all lit up with excitement, almost completely lacking in cynicism, and Perry would reconsider. Fuck . Then there was yet another problem. By the time Perry went looking for him in the middle of their latest excursion, Harry was up against a wall and staring with visible confusion and amazement into the eyes of a tall, dark and handsome thirty-something who had an arm braced on the wall at face height and was leaning in too close, most likely describing what he was thinking of doing to Harry. It was not the first time Perry had broken up that kind of situation. Harry had a way of attracting everybody that he'd never want, which meant anyone with a dick. He seemed to be some sort of…draw. \"Taken,\" Perry said in a bright sing-song, grabbing Harry by one bicep and dragging him along behind. He knew better than to say anything like that in front of someone who knew who he was - he had a rep to maintain, after all - but for clueless, drunken idiots who found Harry irresistible, it wasn't an issue. \"Wow,\" Harry said breathlessly, stumbling along. \"He said - \" \"Forget it,\" Perry said dismissively. \"Do you ever - \" \"No,\" Perry said. \"I'm one hell of a lot better than whatever he made up.\" Harry's knees buckled. He folded to the floor in an ungainly heap, and Perry paused to look down on him. \"Oh, Chief,\" he said, shaking his head. \"I'm going to blackmail you over this until you die.\" \"Uh,\" Harry mumbled into the floor. \"Mmmph.\" When Perry dragged him upright and out of the party, Harry was sporting the noticeable beginnings of a boner. \"You are one confused little monkey,\" Perry said. \"Ficus,\" Harry said immediately. Perry laughed. That was another thing: the guy made him laugh . Not just the socially polite snicker he'd developed early on. Harry could startle him into actually laughing. Harry glanced at him warily. \"Get in the car, idiot.\" Perry was still chuckling to himself when he got in. \"He was into you,\" he said with a smirk. \"Given the chance, I think that would be literal.\" \"Not gay,\" Harry said loudly. \"Can't say it enough.\" \"The lady doth protest too - \" \"Not happening,\" Harry snapped. \"Hoist with his own petard, an't shall go hard …\" \"If I was ever gonna let some guy fuck me, it would be you,\" Harry said. They both froze. Harry's eyes went wide, comically wide, and Perry started to laugh. Harry's voice took on an edge of panic. \"Hey, I'm just…it was a response. Okay? You know, because, guys, I don't really like guys, so if there was ever one and it had to happen, because aliens took over or whatever, and made everybody gay, then, if I had to be stuck with somebody, you're like the only…I mean if you weren't, even, shit, maybe if I just knew you or something, right, you're still really hot, I would still do it.\" Harry's eyes got even wider as he stopped for breath and his own words sank in. Perry kept laughing. \"Jesus,\" Harry said, \"I mean…you know what I mean, right? I hate guys, guys are gross, no offense, I love tits, I mean, tits on girls, because I am really, really fucking straight, but if I wasn't, like, hypothetically, completely straight, I could do a lot worse than you. Plus, we already kissed and everything, anyway.\" Perry was turning a few shades that couldn't be healthy with the laughing he was doing. \"Fuck,\" Harry said. \" Fuck .\" \"Keep digging the hole, Chief,\" Perry gasped. No one made him laugh like Harry did. He told himself that was the real reason he hadn't turned the idiot loose. \"It wasn't really a kiss, it was messed up, so I'm only trying to say that if I was stuck choosing between you, and that guy, I would choose you,\" Harry said. \"So, luckily, I'm not gay and that's not a problem, at all.\" \"Luckily,\" Perry said, holding his side and nearly giggling. \"I thank God every day that you're not gay, Harry.\" \"Just so we're…I mean, you get it,\" Harry said. \"I'm not fucking any guys anytime soon.\" Perry broke into a renewed fit of laughter. \"Anytime soon ?\" \"Even though I'd do anything for you,\" Harry said, then his eyes went wide again in shock. Perry quit laughing so fast that it left a low, hollow place in the car. Perry always sounded angry by default when he was handed something he wasn't sure how to process. \"What the fuck is wrong with you?\" \"I don't know,\" Harry said immediately. \"Sorry. I'm sorry.\" Silence the rest of the way home. Once there, Harry made himself scarce as fast as he could without running. Perry stared after him, looking ready to kill. The best and worst thing about Harry was the nonstop, accidental honesty. / / / \"I thought I told you to stay away from the fucking coffee maker.\" Perry was not in a better mood the next morning. Luckily, Harry was mostly impervious. \"I didn't touch the fucking coffee maker,\" he snapped back from a distance. \"You probably did it in your sleep, just, coming out here and pushing buttons because you like pushing buttons so much.\" Perry sighed. God hated him. He knew it. There was no other explanation. \"Call and check on that wiretap permit for the Carston case,\" he said to Harry without looking at him. \"Then watch the front for awhile, I got stuff to do.\" \"Dabney's called twice,\" Harry said. \"Why the hell didn't you tell me?\" When he glanced up, Harry was giving him a deeply disgruntled look. \"You have your phone turned off. He called the backup office number and left a message.\" He turned and stalked down the stairs. \"Don't be such a bitch,\" Perry yelled. One of Harry's hands popped back up through the railing and flipped him off. \"You keep doing that, you're gonna be missing more fingers,\" Perry said. When nothing more came from the stairs, Perry smirked. Everything was back to normal . Harry sat at the main desk downstairs and shuffled shit around, trying to look busy in case Perry snuck up on him again. He hated that, from the beginning, the way Perry tended to wander up behind him and scare him half to death. Like that was training or something, all that ninja bullshit about being aware of his surroundings. Perry just liked to yell at him. He reminded himself again that he needed to learn to shut up, something he'd been trying to teach himself since about the age of ten. It was no wonder Perry had been so good at this business on his own in LA for years, because he could get people to tell him anything. Harry already had a shutting-up problem, but with Perry he just seemed to fucking overshare on a daily basis. He couldn't seem to help it. Fucking impossible to get a wiretapping permit on the best of days, so no luck there, yet. Goddamn bureaucracy. Perry kept reminding him that they had to handle damn near everything like it might end up in court, because plenty of things did. He could always just go down there and talk someone into it. That usually seemed to work when doing shit over the phone didn't move things quick enough. Quickly enough? Quick enough? Quickly was an adverb, and if he just said quick rather than quickly, it made it seem like the mechanism that… \"Never mind,\" he mumbled. He was never going to get that one straightened out. In any case, Perry said it had something to do with his 'dumb, lost puppy' look, something Harry didn't believe at all. Harmony said it was because he was adorable. It was one hell of a culture shock to be living in LA, but it was worth it. \"Quit daydreaming,\" Perry said directly behind him. Harry tried not to jump, but he did it anyway. Dammit . Perry walked around and sat in one of the client chairs, propping his feet on the desk and flipping his phone back open to check his messages. \"Dabney heard this guy might be embezzling,\" he said. \"Wants me to look into it. It's one of the bigger movie studios, no matter which one. Guy's not quite big time, maybe medium-time, running a little something on the side, pulls capital from the day job, never thinks anybody will notice. Name is Dick Maslin.\" \"Right,\" Harry said. \" Dick . So who is this Dick?\" \"Exec,\" Perry said. \"Aaaaand that tells me nothing, \" Harry said. \"Everybody's an exec. Why don't they do some sort of internal investigation? Isn't that what big companies usually do?\" \"Politics,\" Perry said. \"Ever heard of them? You don't fucking pull an exec aside in The Industry and start asking questions. You catch them in the act.\" \"So why us, then?\" Harry said. \"Because you're friends with Dabney?\" \"Probably because I'm gay,\" Perry said. \"And Maslin is as gay as the day is long.\" \"Days aren't that long, in the winter,\" Harry said. Then something seemed to click, and he snapped his fingers to punctuate it. \"Waitaminute, what's it matter? Just because you're gay? What, he thinks there's some secret language to it or something?\" He was genuinely angry on Perry's behalf. \"That's bullshit, it's not like you have some special -\" \"Shut up,\" Perry said. Harry did, immediately. Perry had at least gained that much sway over him, recently. \"Yeah, it's likely because I'm gay,\" Perry said. \"So what? It's a fee, and not a hell of a lot of work. I've tossed a hundred embezzlers.\" Harry stared between Perry and the view out the front windows, looking annoyed. \"What the fuck are you feeling all defensive for, anyway?\" Perry said. \"He doesn't need to treat you like -\" \"Like what?\" Perry said. \"Are you insane enough to think you need to defend me, over anything?\" Harry glowered. Perry stared at him. \"Being gay's not bad, and being acknowledged as being gay isn't an insult,\" Harry said. \"It's just, did he even ask, or was he like, 'Hey you're gay, therefore you're perfect for this'?\" Perry kept glancing between Harry and his phone with a strange mix of curiosity and annoyance on his face. Harry slid down further in his chair, frowning harder. \"My long-sullied virtue doesn't need your half-assed chivalry,\" Perry said. Harry made a noncommittal sound. \"It's like Guinevere trying to defend Lancelot,\" Perry said, then paused. \"That was maybe the worst…analogy ever,\" Harry said, resting his chin in one hand to try and slightly mask the threat of a grin. \"I get to choose another,\" Perry said. \"Yeah, keep trying. You're not…like, some token…whatever,\" Harry said. \"Dabney might keep me on retainer for something besides being gay,\" Perry said in a hard, final tone. \"Like it's any of your business.\" Harry let something go verbally, for once, but it was obvious that he was still turning something over in his head. Perry wanted to hit Harry, and he wasn't quite sure why, which made him want to hit him even more. / / / Two days passed without a single mention of the case or whether they (Harry always thought they when it came to cases whether Perry let him be part of them or not) were taking it. Perry sent Harry on a dozen or so errands that involved getting a few things notarized, cashing a couple of checks and getting a copy of a police report, because he could be trusted with those things, but not the coffee pot. Perry came back from the shooting range with a gleam in his eye that Harry recognized as one of his eureka moments. Harry had just spent an hour on the phone with Harmony, so he was in a ridiculously good mood and wasn't braced for the insanity that came out of Perry's mouth. He blinked and listened for a moment, blinked some more, than said, \"I think I just heard you say you want me to…be gay.\" \"Gay enough to get close to Maslin and get him talking,\" Perry said, looking smug. \"I've done a little checking, and you're pretty much his type, whatever the hell that says about him.\" \"Seriously?\" \"You'll get his attention,\" Perry said. \"Let's look at the evidence, shall we? You attract everyone you're terrified of or repulsed by within a fifty mile radius. He'll come right for you, maybe proposition you, and -\" \"No way,\" Harry said. \"No goddamn way. I -\" Perry hooked one hand around the back of Harry's neck and pulled him in close. Harry staggered forward into him and held his breath, inches away, hands braced on Perry's chest. \"Sooner or later, every bi or gay jackass at a party comes straight for you,\" Perry said, breath soft and warm on Harry's temple. \"It's probably the wide-eyed, clueless thing you have going, which puts a big bullseye right on your forehead to either be rolled or bent over something. I spend fifty percent of my time networking or tailing at these fucking parties, and the rest of the time warding horny assholes away from you or keeping you from doing something stupid . Do you get it, Harry? You never even see the majority of what heads your way. So use your special gift for the cause and do your part by standing around and being you. Think you can do that?\" Harry nodded quickly. \"We'll have to do something about the perpetual mess you thrive on being, then,\" Perry said. / / / Harmony found out about the plan later that evening when she came over for dinner. She sat between them on the couch over beers and laughed for maybe ten minutes while Harry drowned in annoyance and tried not to find the laughter adorable. When she could breathe, she said, \"Let me help. I get to help make Harry gay-ready. Or at least let me watch.\" \"I've got this handled,\" Perry said. \"He's slightly more hetero with you around, and you'll ruin the effect.\" Harry was troubled the most by the emphasis Harmony had put on let me watch . \"It's no big deal, Harry,\" Harmony said. \"I've done this for Perry a few times. You know, be all interested in somebody to distract them. It's just an acting job. You'll be fine.\" Then she went back to laughing. Harry pointed at her and glared at Perry. \"This is what you meant when you said she's 'done some work' for you?\" \"You gonna defend her from some imaginary slight, now, too?\" Perry said with a smirk. Harry had a hard time being annoyed by anything with Harmony in his lap, especially when she was laughing. \"He likes to talk about cars,\" Perry said the next morning. \"He only likes to hang out in a couple of places, so we'll pick one tomorrow night and see if he shows up, and if he doesn't, we'll try the other.\" Harry usually liked debriefings. He even liked research. He liked neither in this case. \"None of that makes any difference if he doesn't even look me over,\" Harry said. \"How much conversation do I have to have with this guy?\" \"Shut up and listen,\" Perry said. \"You have to be prepared to make small talk with him and not bore him so badly with your inane chatter that he drops you before you can get anything out of him. Get him talking, and then get him talking about his job.\" \"What do I do?\" Perry looked at him like he was insane. \"Hello, I mean, what's my fake job,\" Harry said. Perry shrugged. \"You're a hairdresser.\" \"No, come on,\" Harry said, titling his head back in exasperation. \"Jesus, that's so cliché'. I get to do something cool, like, I'm already rich so I don't need somebody who thinks he's about to become rich. Think about it, I need to be his ideal guy but not too ideal.\" \"Every now and then, something smart comes out of your mouth,\" Perry said. \"I just wish you sounded smart when you said it.\" Harry rolled his eyes. \"It can't be anything in the entertainment industry, either, because he'll know.\" \"Then say you invented something stupid that turned out to be a hit, and you're living off the royalties,\" Perry said. \"Post-Its,\" Harry said. \" Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, \" they said in unison, pointing at each other. \"I said it first, you owe me a Coke,\" Harry said, laughing. \"No, I said it first, and that whole East coast Coke-owing thing is bullshit,\" Perry said. \"C'mon, Chief. Think of something.\" \"I invented a…new kind of really cheap packing material for shipping that keeps the contents the same temp all the time,\" Harry said, snapping his fingers. \"He won't know anything about that, or even care.\" \" I don't even care,\" Perry said, making notes. \"Ok, that's a go. Don't go into depth about anything, just keep the conversation on him. Be interested . Get it? Don't get all caught up and start sharing personal stories and shit, because you'll give yourself away. The one big thing you have going for you is your total lack of official behavior. He won't make you for even having met a cop, much less working with one.\" The interest in Harry's voice was intense and raised it a pitch. \"You used to be a cop?\" \"Once,\" Perry said dismissively. \"Stay focused, Harry.\" \"Because I wouldn't have figured you for one, I just thought that - \" \" Harry! \" \"Right, focused,\" Harry mumbled. \"Go look up car shit and try and remember enough to keep a decent conversation going,\" Perry said. \"And look Maslin up, while you're at it, so you don't let yourself get hit on by the wrong guy. You look enough like his most recent ex that he'll almost have to do something .\" \"Great,\" Harry said. \"It's the something that worries me. What am I supposed to do if he hits on me?\" \"The same thing you'd do when a hot girl hits on you,\" Perry said. Then he covered his eyes with one hand. \"I forgot, that never happens to you. Have you ever been hit on, in this life?\" \"Funny,\" Harry said. \"I'm just saying, is there like a secret handshake you guys have?\" \"Only in private,\" Perry said. \"And there are no hands involved. Jesus Christ, Harry, I promise you we don't have magic bullets we shoot from our dicks, there's no handshake, and it's not communicable. Okay?\" \"Hey, I'd just had my balls electrocuted,\" Harry said. \"I was allowed to jump to any conclusion I wanted.\" Perry just shook his head and fell to rubbing the spot on his forehead just between his brows as if warding off a headache. \"You know my methods. Apply them.\" Harry could tell he was quoting from something, but he had no idea what. When Perry glanced at him, he seemed kind of disappointed that Harry hadn't gotten it. \"Just be you, Harry, and relax, and try to be interested in him. You're capable of some basic, goofy charm that some people enjoy. Please remember that less is more with what comes out of your mouth.\" \"Or goes in,\" Harry mumbled. Perry snorted. \"Right, try not to accidentally blow him.\" \"What if he wants to sleep with me or something?\" Harry said. \"No one, anywhere, actually wants to sleep with you,\" Perry said. \"Offer to meet up with him some other time and place. This is just a fact-finding thing, not a sting operation. If there's a second meeting, you'll be wired. All I want right now is for him to drop something that might give us a lead on whether he's actually skimming, and how. People will say damn near anything to someone they want to fuck.\" Their eyes met for a moment. Harry froze. \"Except you,\" Perry said. \"You'll say anything to anybody.\" / / / \"Hold still,\" Perry said. Harry was perched on a stool in the bathroom, leaning away and staring at Perry with open trepidation. Perry had a can of some hair product in his hand and Harry was fairly sure he wasn't going to like whatever happened next. \"Is this the big slumber party?\" Harry said. \"We do each other's hair, gossip a little, maybe order pizza later?\" Perry slapped one of Harry's ears. \" Ow . I can do my own hair, you know.\" \"Obviously not , from what I've seen,\" Perry said, applying mousse, combing his fingers through the shorter strands at Harry's temples, over his ears and down to his nape. Harry shivered and his eyes rolled up in his head. \"Knock it off, you little pervert,\" Perry said, but he didn't sound annoyed. Harry's tone was full of all the outraged defensiveness he could muster with Perry playing with his hair. \"You're doing it on purpose!\" \"You're gayer than I could ever hope to be,\" Perry said. \"So long as I'm better at something than you, I don't give a fuck what it is.\" Perry chuckled low in his throat and kept applying mousse. Harry was suspiciously quiet, face tilted up, expression ecstatic. Perry tried to ignore him. Finally, he turned the hair dryer on Harry, who reacted to having his hair blow dried and brushed like a dog getting a tummy rub, nearly thumping one foot on the floor. Perry shook his head, fussed with Harry's hair a little more, then stepped back and regarded his handiwork with a critical eye. Harry waited, refusing to glance in the mirror. He just didn't want to know. Perry sprayed hair spray on him. \" Fuck! \" Harry shouted, shielding his eyes. \"You have to be kidding!\" \"Quit being a big straight baby and go get dressed,\" Perry said. Harry went back to his room and put on the long-sleeved white and burgundy Henley, dark jacket and carefully chosen form-fitting jeans. He straightened everything reflexively, and walked back out. \" No ,\" Perry snapped. \"Slouch like you usually do. Christ, is that what you think of as standing straight?\" Harry sighed but relaxed, shoving his hands into his pockets and leaning against the wall like he didn't really care anymore, which he didn't, so it wasn't even a front. He got an appreciative once-over complete with a raised eyebrow. \"You almost pass as some kind of…something, I don't know what yet.\" \"What, I'm so hot you can barely look at me, right?\" Harry said. \"Nice try.\" Perry stepped up to him and adjusted the jacket's collar, fingers brushing against Harry's throat. He ran his palms down Harry's chest, smoothing fabric. \"You'll do.\" He didn't step away. Harry looked at the center of his chest and wondered if he could get Harmony to play with his hair without telling her why it was so important. \"What's the plan, again?\" Perry said. \"I already -\" \" Say it .\" Harry sighed. \"We go in separately, we both keep an eye out, I stand around looking clueless and lost like I always do, and wait for Maslin to come chat me up.\" \"Good boy,\" Perry said. \"Get in the fucking car.\" / / / \"Why do you call me Chief?\" Harry said. Perry sighed. They were obviously going to have another one of their fascinating car-chats. Harry was forbidden to ask questions on stakeouts, when he came along, so he snuck them in whenever they happened to be together in a car in a non-stakeout situation. Harry babbled and fidgeted when he was nervous, and Perry was hoping that if he indulged it before they got to their destination, Harry would wear himself out a little and not lose his mind in front of Maslin. \"It's from the Doom Patrol comics,\" Perry said. The look on Harry's face said he had no idea what the hell that was about. \"Read comics, ever?\" Perry said. \"I assume that's where you learned grammar.\" \"Batman,\" Harry said. His tone was slightly wary. He'd known Perry long enough to realize that wariness was a good idea. \"Mainstream,\" Perry said. \"How predictable.\" \"So answer the question,\" Harry said. \"The Chief was a character in the Doom Patrol comics,\" Perry said. \"A genius, which you aren't. I was being ironic. Plus, he ended up as just a head, in a bucket of ice, drinking milkshakes.\" Harry squinted at him, unsure of how to take that. \"For a while, he had a bomb in his chest,\" Perry said. \"Which I wish you did. Then I could just blow you up rather than listen to you bitch.\" \"Shut up,\" Harry said. \"You love me.\" \"Like the plague,\" Perry said. \"You're the kind of guy who would love the plague,\" Harry shot back. \"Assuming it kills off a few percentage points of the dumbasses on this planet, I just might have a slight fondness for it.\" Harry stared at him for a moment, trying to figure out what the original point had been. It didn't matter. Perry parked well down the block from a bar called The Blue Note and shoved Harry out of the car, waited twenty minutes, and followed. Low lighting, mildly upscale without being too pretentious; brass and leather and oak. Widely mixed clientele, from suits to sweatsuits. Preset top 40 music, horseshoe bar at the back, tall circular tables that were too small to do more than balance a drink on. It wasn't about comfort; it was about being seen. He placed himself near the wall closest to the doors and milled, people-watching. He didn't recognize anyone for the first several minutes, which was very, very good since he didn't want to be made. Typical crowd for a bar near west LA; affected malaise tempered with the occasional purposefully struck pose in case someone important was watching. Living in LA meant assuming someone was watching you, sooner or later. After about fifteen minutes, he gave up lurking and headed for the back, knowing that if Harry was still milling around trying to be cute, he'd have seen him. He got a club soda and glanced to his left down the length of the curved bar. He had a terrible moment of thinking, just before he realized who it was, that the guy with the big, dark eyes and lean face sitting at the end of the bar was striking to look at. There was Harry, grinning and gesturing, eyes alight, yammering away about something that had to be pointless, but he'd found his mark. Maslin seemed to be hanging off every word. The latter had a mildly amused but darkly interested look on his face that made Perry look longer than he should have. Harry leaned in a little, smirking, lashes dipping. Making a stab at coy. Flirting. Maslin was leaning in to meet him, sharing some joke, shoulder brushing Harry's. Leaning in even further, lips right against Harry's ear, hands coming to rest on Harry's thighs. Harry's eyes flashed with a moment of genuine, wary discomfort, visible from yards away, but he laid his own hands over Maslin's anyway. Perry was halfway across the floor, hand already out to make contact and likely do damage before he realized what he was doing. He stopped and glared, hands clenched into fists, then took his drink and turned his back and deliberately got as far back into the crowd as he could without completely losing sight. A painful half hour of watching Harry try and be a slightly exaggerated version of himself followed, and Perry waited, treating it like a stakeout except taking care to change positions from time to time. He didn't want to catch the eyes of either man. If Harry saw him, he was not going to be able to keep from lighting up with recognition. If Maslin saw him, well, Perry wasn't sure if he would recognize him. When Maslin wrote something down on a napkin and slid it over, Harry took it and began the sly, glancing-up-from-under-his-lashes thing again, slipping it into a jacket pocket. Maslin brushed fingertips along Harry's jaw as he stood, pressing a thumb into Harry's lower lip, smiling. Harry looked startled but didn't react, not even when Maslin leaned in close to murmur in his ear again. Harry stared at Maslin's back, watching until he was sure the other man was gone. He turned and drummed nervous fingertips along the surface of the bar for a long moment, then checked his watch. Even from there, Perry could see his hands were shaking. It almost killed off his anger. Almost. Harry downed the rest of his drink and left the bar, heading for the bathroom. Perry followed. / / / That was some crazy shit, but I think I pulled it off. Harry was fairly proud of himself, for once. He washed his hands, whistling something, completely unaware that Perry was standing just to one side, ready to kill him. He shut the water off and turned to get a paper towel, and yelped when he ran right into Perry. Perry had Harry by the back of his neck and was walking him out the emergency exit toward his car like he was a recalcitrant child. Harry hunched his shoulders to try and minimize the vise-like grip. \"Ow, ow , what the fuck ?\" When Perry remained silent and tightened his grip, Harry gave up and let Perry manhandle him. It didn't even occur to him to try and get away. When they got close enough to it, Perry shoved him up against the side of the car. Harry caught himself with his hands and rolled along the car's surface to face Perry. \"Wha -\" \"That's the last time you ever pull something like that,\" Perry said, voice low and angry. Even without the tone, the lack of name calling would have tipped Harry off as to how angry he was. \"I don't -\" \"The touching, Harry,\" Perry snarled. \"At no point did I tell you to feel him up .\" \"He touched first,\" Harry said breathlessly. \"He just started talking, opened up, you know? I was getting information. That's what this was about. What the fuck is your problem , man? You're the one who asked me to - \" \"I never asked ,\" Perry snapped. \"I told you. I told you to stand around and be you , not to fucking hump the guy's leg.\" \"I got his fucking attention like you wanted!\" Harry yelled. \"I didn't want you to get his attention!\" Perry shouted. \"You idiot , if he approached you , and started talking, fine. In no way were you supposed to go looking for him and make a fucking spectacle of yourself. You - \" \"You're jealous,\" Harry blurted. They stared at each other for a moment, looking equally horrified. \"Holy shit. You're actually j -\" Perry took a swing at him. Harry just barely ducked out of the way, then scrambled away until the car was between him and Perry. \"Come back here,\" Perry said in the kind of voice that sounded like that was the last thing Harry would want to do, if he liked his bones in the configuration they were already in. He started around the car. \"You are not allowed to kill me over something that's your own fault,\" Harry said, making sure he stayed as far from Perry as the length and width of the car would allow. \" Not justifiable homicide. Hit yourself instead of me.\" \"You're fired,\" Perry said. \"Okay, look, you don't mean that,\" Harry said. \"I don't officially work for you, anyway. Shit, Perry, what the fuck is your problem! I was trying to make it easier. He approached me . I didn't fuck anything up, I finally didn't fuck something up, and you're all…whatever this whole bipolar freakout thing is.\" \"He came to you,\" Perry said, pausing by the front of the car. \" Yes ,\" Harry said from the right rear quarter panel. \"That's what I've been trying to tell you. I was just trying to keep him talking, once he was already there. Okay?\" \"You suck at flirting,\" Perry said. \"He didn't seem to mind,\" Harry said, then scrambled away with his hands along the trunk as Perry started toward him again. Perry faked him out by starting to backtrack, and when Harry turned the other way, he moved faster than Harry thought he was capable of. Harry slipped in the gravel and Perry was already on him before he could regain his footing. Harry cowered, arms up and around his head. \"Don'tkillmedon'tkillmeIdidn'tevenenjoyit!\" \"Idiot,\" Perry said, yanking him up and gripping him by his jacket, shaking him a little. \"The reason I tell you to do things a specific way is because I'm looking for a specific result, and I know you don't have the mental capacity to deal with really involved scenarios.\" \"I was against this from the beginning,\" Harry said, voice muffled by his own arms. \"Let the record show, th -\" \"Get in the car before I decide to leave you here to go home with whatever else with a dick wants to hit on you.\" Harry tucked himself into the car in record time. Perry got in and didn't look at him. \"I was just trying to be good bait,\" Harry said softly. Perry's shoulders slumped, and he rested his forehead on the steering wheel for a moment. Then he grabbed Harry by the scruff of his neck again and shook him a little. Even though it was much gentler than it had been before, Harry tried to tuck his face into his shirt and cringe back against the door, but it didn't do him any good. \"I'm never going to use you as bait,\" Perry said. \"I can't believe you thought that and then did it anyway. There's a huge difference between bait and you just hanging around and keeping an eye out.\" \"I wanted to be…useful,\" Harry said. \"You know, do whatever it took to help you.\" Perry let go of Harry and rested a hand against his own forehead instead. \"I hate you,\" Perry said. Harry took that for what it really was and un-cringed himself with visible relief. \"So tell me what you learned,\" Perry said. Harry untucked his face and straightened the rest of the way. \"He said he was about to come into a lot of money,\" Harry said. \"Said he's really high up on the ladder at Paramount and he was headed for big things. He just came off a break up, non-public, said it was nothing because they were never good together anyway, and he needed someone he could trust, to be his right hand. Someone like me, because he could tell by looking in my eyes that I was that kind of guy, that I wouldn't fuck him in any way he didn't want me to.\" Harry squirmed a little without realizing it was so visible to Perry. \"He said he's been busting his ass for years and finally found a way to get things to work for him, and he's been planning things out just right and I should seriously think about what's important, about maybe just taking a chance and dropping everything and taking off with him because we could be great.\" \"You got all that, in half an hour ?\" Perry said. \"All without hooking his balls up to a battery?\" Harry shifted uncomfortably again at the memory Perry was invoking. \"People like to talk to me. Most people.\" \"You're mach ten gay bait,\" Perry said, sounding amazed. \"What the fuck. What the hell is it about you, that every fag for miles gravitates toward you?\" \"Um,\" Harry said. When he didn't continue, Perry glanced at him. \"I just…you…I mean, so, does that mean, you're -\" \"No, Harry,\" Perry said, as if to a very slow child. \"Idiot. Not if you were the last human male on earth after some bizarre apocalypse that involved the destruction of every cock on the planet but yours. I have no attraction to you whatsoever. You may as well be a woman. In fact, in some ways, you are.\" Harry leaned back into his seat and digested that. \"You thought I was hot, earlier,\" he said finally. \"I could tell.\" \"You dense little jackanape,\" Perry said. \"There's a difference between lust and appreciation , which you obviously don't fucking understand.\" \"You appreciated me?\" Harry said, hearing the ridiculous amount of hope in his own voice. Perry tsked . \"You clean up well enough,\" he said. \"With my help.\" Harry felt like thumping his foot against the floor again. \"What else did he say?\" Perry said. \"He wants to meet me tomorrow night, at his place,\" Harry said. \"Shit, what else do I need to do? He practically admitted to everything.\" \"He didn't admit to shit,\" Perry said. \"You need to get the rest of it, what he's going to do, where he's going to go. He's not doing this alone, and we need names. You've nearly got your foot in the door - or your dick in his ass, if the metaphor fits - so you need the rest of it. You have to go.\" \"What?\" Harry spluttered. \"He almost had his fucking tongue in my ear, okay? That's not cool.\" \"I'm going to be watching you the whole time,\" Perry said. \"You think I'll let him do anything to you?\" He realized too late how that sounded, and when he glanced at Harry again, the goofball was staring at him with some sort of smug adoration, all crinkled eyes and drawn brows and a half-smirk. \"I hate you,\" Perry sighed, and started the car. \"You'll never be good at this, Harry,\" he said. \"All I can ask is that you suck a little less.\" \"Wow, imagine you asking a guy to suck a little less ,\" Harry snapped. Perry whipped his head around so fast that Harry flinched back a little. Then Perry began to laugh. Harry raised his eyebrows and kept a slight distance. But he was kind of happy, all the same. / / / \"I get to be armed,\" Harry said the next evening. Perry was goofing with his hair again, only Harry was too tense to think it was as much fun that time. Perry's voice was as stern as anyone warning a puppy not to pee on the new carpet. \" No . No, no.\" \"He's going to try and put more than his tongue in my ear,\" Harry argued. \"He might be one of those sick fucks who tries to put his dick anywhere, you know, any port in a storm.\" \"I'm pretty sure your virgin ears are safe,\" Perry said. \"If I wanna keep my insurance in force, there are no guns on your person at any time. Possibly ever. You're the biggest liability risk I've ever seen, outside of Jackie Chan. And quit the nonstop hetero freakout. You're so bi it's breaking records.\" \"Not helping,\" Harry said, glaring at him in the mirror. \"I suggest you adjust your expectations in that area,\" Perry said. \"Jesus, Harry. You're wired. I'll be listening.\" He paused. \"And laughing while you fend him off.\" Harry thought about the really angry, really huge guy with the chair leg at that one party, and the look in Perry's eyes when he'd nearly shoved his gun down the guy's throat. He had never, never been afraid of Perry, except for that one instant. And to be fair, Perry hadn't really been Perry right then. Not his Perry. Perry met his eyes in the mirror for a moment and rested a hand on the back of his neck. There was a promise there, before they both looked away and Perry poked him in the back of the head. \"Pick a safe word.\" Harry immediately stared at him in the mirror again. \"Whaaaaat?\" \"Let's pretend you need a safe word for…something,\" Perry said. \"I don't like pretending,\" Harry said immediately. \"C'mon, I'm sure it'll come in handy once you've lived in LA long enough.\" \"My safe word is 'fuck off',\" Harry said. \"That's a phrase, and it's not that safe,\" Perry said. \"Look, we have to agree on the 'I need help' trigger word so I can call you and pretend to be an urgent family emergency so you can get out of there.\" \"Oh. Uh…shit, why didn't you just say so?\" \"More fun to watch you squirm,\" Perry said. \"You're the one who assumed I was being kinky.\" Harry shook his head. / / / He chose magic. / / / Time to play dress up again. Harry huffed an impatient sigh. \"Is this really necessary?\" \"You're not trolling a bar this time, idiot, you're on a date ,\" Perry said. \"With a gay man. There's a difference.\" \"He has to know I'm not gay,\" Harry said. \"Don't you guys have…straightdar?\" Perry sighed in a way that let Harry know he was not going to deign to answer that. Harry shrugged. White button down shirt this time, better jacket, decent cologne from Perry's collection. Less stubble. Black boots. Another pair of tight jeans. \"Seriously,\" Harry said. \"These are not comfortable.\" \"You have the ass of a sixteen year old track star,\" Perry said. \"That's why you're not triggering his 'straightdar'. And I can't fucking believe I just said your stupid, made-up word aloud.\" Harry wandered off in his head at the remark, weighing it, ignoring Perry while the latter adjusted his clothes to his liking. Perry's hands were warm and careful and he barely noticed. Harry stood outside and smoked until the cab came to get him. Perry followed at a wide distance and was around the corner from Maslin's less than half an hour later, listening. Maslin lived in West LA, in one of the resort-style apartment communities that catered to the faux-upscale set. The Palazzo at Park La Brea . Gated entrance, concierge service, Mediterranean ambience. Not above his pay scale, but well below the scale he meant to have if he was skimming. Depending on what Harry got out of him, the next step would be to rifle the guy's office after hours. It all looked textbook, except for the undercover part. Perry tailgated in behind another resident a few minutes after Harry's cab. Gated community. Yeah, like that was ever a good example of security. All an illusion, like every other goddamn thing in LA. He listened to Harry buzz Maslin's apartment. There were basic pleasantries, mild awkwardness from Harry like usual, then Maslin seemed to be showing him the place. Offered him a drink. Got Harry talking while he seemed to take one hell of a long time putting drinks together. Don't talk, Harry , Perry thought. Don't give him the upper hand, c'mon . \"Ever been in love, Harry?\" Maslin said. Clink of ice, faintly distant. \"Sure,\" Harry said. \"Maybe…a few times.\" \"You don't sound sure,\" Maslin said. \"Not sure about the last one,\" Harry said. \"Not a good idea. Not my type. What about you?\" \"Thought the last one might be forever,\" Maslin said. \"Come on,\" Harry said. \"You believe in that stuff? In your line of work?\" \"No,\" Maslin said with a laugh. \"I mean it just felt like it went on forever.\" Perry got the distinct feeling, suddenly, that he'd missed something. He shrugged it off. They talked cars, and Harry held his own. The new 2005 Audi A8 had a lightweight aluminum chassis that made it feel more nimble than other full-size sedans; the Porsche 911 Carrera and Carrera S had been redesigned. He started pausing a little between phrases, and Perry put it down to nervousness, or Harry just trying to make sure he had his details right. A shuffle, a clink of ice against glass, and Maslin's voice was closer. Sitting right next to Harry, probably. \"How long have you been in LA, Harry?\" Maslin said. \"Long enough to know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em,\" Harry said. Perry shook his head, wondering what the hell it was like to think the way Harry thought. There seemed to be a mildly slurred amusement to the quip, though, and Perry wasn't sure if he'd heard that correctly. Maslin made a small, amused sound. \"The more we talk, the more I like you. I think we should get to know each other better.\" No response. Perry waited, and for a moment he just figured nothing was happening, but then he realized he'd lost the signal altogether because even the ambient noise was gone. The wire was dead. Shit. He sat back and thought. No reason to think anything had gone wrong; Maslin didn't have a record of violence. The wire was crap, and that was all. He still had a visual on the apartment. There was no reason for the whisper of worry in the back of his head. He'd give it maybe forty minutes, then call Harry no matter what and tell him to get out. / / / Harry didn't fight when Maslin pulled him up off the sofa and pressed him into the facing wall. He was suddenly just hanging on and trying not to fall down, and that took all of his attention. His limbs were loose and didn't respond immediately when he tried to move. \"I put a little something in your drink, Harry,\" Maslin said with a laugh. \"You were so nervous and such a rube that you didn't even notice. It's great, right?\" \"Yeah,\" Harry said, leaning into him. \"It's great.\" Maslin laughed a little and then leaned in, mouth pressing rough against his, one hand rough in his hair, a knee pressed between his legs. Harry didn't fight that, either. The world was narrowing and spinning a little and he knew he should have been protesting at least a little, but he was trying to stay upright. He had to get more info. It was a kiss, a real kiss, except not, fully there physically but not emotionally, not caring about him. He could tell the difference, even as much as the world was off and getting fuzzy. The guy knew what he was doing and was doing it, kind of ramping him up. He felt like he should have shoved him off. It didn't matter right then. \"I want to show you something,\" Maslin said in his ear. \"It's down in my car, though. It'll only take a minute.\" \"I'm not…I mean, I should…you…\" Harry completely lost his train of thought and knew there was something important about it, that he should have been doing or saying something, but he couldn't remember what. The room spun. \"Just for a minute, sweetheart,\" Maslin said. \"C'mon. Perry won't mind.\" Harry wavered. He knew that wasn't right, he should have…done something. Perry said… The world tilted a little. Perry. \"Okay.\" / / / Perry only lasted twenty minutes before he gave in and dialed Harry's number. Harry did not answer. The low hum of suspicion he'd been battling became a full blown air-raid siren and he was out of his car and around the corner, up the stairs, gun drawn once inside. If he fucked this up and burst in when nothing was wrong and Harry had just simply forgotten to turn his phone on, then shit, that was just going to have to do, but he knew in his gut that wasn't the case. He listened close at Maslin's door and heard nothing, not a damn thing, and the damn door was unlocked when he tried it. In the middle of the living room floor was the wire Harry had been wearing, stark against a cream area rug. He went room to room and there was nothing, no one. Jesus, what was he going to tell Harmony? That he lost her boyfriend, or whatever the hell he was to her? That he flat out underestimated some fucking studio exec, of all people, and Harry would probably turn up eventually, but not in one piece? But the feeling in the pit of his stomach was not a harbinger of worry about breaking something to Harmony, or even that he might have fucked up. He had lost Harry . Do you think I'd let him do anything to you? Maslin was a stupid, small time embezzler. There was no way he'd gotten the drop on them. \"He's not that stupid,\" Perry said aloud, redialing Harry's number. No answer. Voicemail; Harry trying to sound official but revealing the faintest hint of glee. This is Harold Lockhart with Sentron, Inc. Please leave a message. Maslin didn't have a record of violence. But that didn't mean he wasn't capable of all kinds of shit. He felt himself begin to panic and immediately tried to slam it down. It wasn't going to help him. He was going to think it through, and he'd find Harry. Second floor apartment. Two ways in and out - front door and balcony. Maslin had not wrestled Harry off the balcony. Two turns in the hallway, two sets of stairs at opposite ends. Perry had only had a visual on one. The other led through a courtyard with a fountain, decorative pool, potted palms. There was covered parking on the far side. He found the smashed remains of Harry's phone by the fountain. He tried not to make more out of it than it was. Looking around, he could see many points of escape, but the covered parking was the most likely. Maslin was not going to drag Harry far on foot. Harry had obviously not gone willingly. The question was, how far out were they? Twenty minutes worth, if he counted from the moment the wire died. There was quick access to the 101 and the 10 from there, and if he was really paranoid, half an hour to LAX that time of night. God help me, what is he going to do with Harry? Maslin had known what Harry was doing, and he'd tossed Harry's phone. Don't panic. It occurred to him, then, how little he wanted to lose his new roommate. His annoying, noisy, mess of a roommate that had come to mean everything . He called the LAPD detective he knew and paged him. He needed an APB on Maslin's car, if he could get one. He was happy to overreact if it meant not discovering Harry's corpse later. He didn't say kidnapped , when he got a call back. He said surveillance gone bad . All that remained to be seen was how bad. He drove around for an hour, checking alleys and calling hospitals, trying to figure out what the hell else to do. He wasn't good at waiting, and the window to find Maslin before he rabbited over state lines was long closed. There was too much ground to cover; Maslin had put an escape plan into place, and it remained to be seen what kind of detour Harry had caused in that plan. Perry had to admit that Harry was fairly good at getting away, if he could. He went back home to check, on the off chance in a million that Harry would just be there, would just find his way back, was just simply waiting. No dice. He started another online search, and widened it this time. Maslin had somehow made his tail, and had reacted with far too much precision. At first there was nothing interesting on the surface, just minor AP bullshit from film releases. He remembered seeing the photo of Maslin's last ex and had stopped there because the resemblance to Harry was too good to be true, and he'd run with that without looking deeper. And then, suddenly, there it was. His heart sank. Maslin's last ex had disappeared three months earlier, long off the current news cycle and on no one's radar. Since they had broken up more than a month before that, and there was no sign of a body or foul play, it wasn't news. No suspects. Thought the last one might be forever . I mean it just felt like it went on forever. He had underestimated the guy, hugely. He hadn't slipped up that badly in a long, long time, not since his rookie days. Had he become that arrogant? Was that all it was? He found himself thinking don't hurt him, but if you do, please end it quick. When his phone went off, it wasn't a number he recognized, so he was cautious in answering. He wouldn't have put it past Maslin at that point to taunt him if he still had Harry. An uncertain female voice answered him. \"There's a guy down here who isn't gonna last long if someone don't come get him,\" she said. \"He's acting really messed up, and he's not somewhere where it's smart to do that.\" \"His name's Harry,\" Perry said, grabbing his keys, startled to discover it was hard to catch his breath. \"Just tell me where he is, then put him on, okay?\" She gave him the cross streets - Jesus, Harry was wandering around the rougher part of Glassell Park, right in the middle of Avenues territory - then there was a muffled shout and Harry came on. \"Harry,\" Perry said. \"What the fuck is going on?\" \"The lights,\" Harry said, his voice a low gasp of amazement, the nuances audible even over the tinny connection. \"Oh, wow, they're great. There was something I needed to tell you.\" \"Are you hurt?\" Perry said. \"Wait, I remember. Magic .\" Harry started to laugh, slightly manic and uncontrolled. \"Magic, Perry. Magic.\" / / / Harry was lolling against the crumbling brick face of a vacant building when Perry first saw him, and he wasn't alone. There were two prostitutes flanking him, looking almost like an entourage. One of them was laughing at something Harry had said. They both turned to stare at Perry as he pulled up. Perry pulled Harry away from the wall and looked him over. \"Harry? Hey. C'mon.\" Harry smiled at him, half in shadow. \"I think I fucked up. He said he would be right back, but he never came back.\" \"Shit,\" Perry said. He glanced around, taking in the two women who were still standing there as if trying to decide what to do. \"He's cute,\" the blond one said. \"You gonna be nice to him?\" \"He's my -\" Perry paused, and felt the pause, and wanted to turn and slam his own head against the wall. Harry was his what, exactly? Jesus, what the fuck? Where was this coming from? And what did he care about what a couple of strangers thought? \"…friend. So which one of you rolled him?\" That started an immediate chatter of half-hearted offense that started with oh, hey now and quickly graduated to ungrateful motherfucker , but Perry didn't hear most of it. He thanked them and was even halfway sincere. He put Harry into the car and headed for the nearest ER. \"I'm okay,\" Harry whispered, hands pressed to his own face. \"I'm okay, I'm okay.\" Perry was going to demolish Maslin when he found him. / / / The closest decent ER was Glendale Memorial. He sat in the waiting room and finally realized that what he was waiting for was someone to come tell him the kid had flatlined. There was no telling what was in his system. He wanted to believe it was just a diversion, that Harry had been made, nothing more. He just wasn't that much of an optimist. After an hour or so, the attending ER doc was headed straight for him. He always knew them among the techs and nurses, and it wasn't just the badge. It was all in the body language. \"I'm Dr. Leyvas,\" he said, shaking Perry's hand. \"You're here for Mr. Lockhart?\" \"Yes.\" \"Is Mr. Lockhart a regular user of narcotics?\" \"No,\" Perry said. \"No. He wasn't partying. He was drugged. Do you know what it is?\" \"We'd need a full toxicology panel to find out what's in his system, but the preliminary labs are showing a combination of flunitrazepam, an MAOI and Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,\" Leyvas said, glancing at him apologetically as he rolled out syllables with too much practice. Perry actually felt himself blink as he tried to process all of it. Flunitrazepam was a fucking roofie, he knew that, but the other insanely multisyllabic word… \"Meth?\" There was a knowing and slightly regretful tilt of the head. \"The street names include X, E -\" \"Ecstasy,\" Perry said, feeling a sudden surge of anger that approached an ecstasy of its own. \" What does that mean, in this case?\" \"The combination itself isn't automatically lethal at the doses he was apparently given,\" Leyvas said. \"But the combo is potentially lethal. I've seen it before, but haven't personally seen it kill anybody. The purpose of adding the MAOI is to inhibit the metabolism and draw the effects out as long as possible, to leave the victim high as long as possible, up to 16 hours, depending on their tolerance. It can make someone highly suggestible, lacking in any kind of reasonable judgment, gaining a heightened sense of euphoria -\" \"That's him on a good day,\" Perry said. \"It can still be a dangerous combination,\" Leyvas said. \"There are side effects, and the intent is to keep the person compliant for a while. There might be other components that were added that we can't detect. So, he doesn't require hospitalization unless the side effects get out of control, but he needs to be watched, for at least two days. He needs someone to watch him who won't take advantage of the situation but might be able to restrain him. Whoever did this likely meant to keep him for a couple of days, or to cause trouble for whoever might. Can you keep an eye on him?\" \"Yes,\" Perry said immediately, even though it was the last thing he wanted to say. He felt, for the first time in years , the urge to run. This was not his problem, Harry was not his goddamn problem . But all he'd heard was compliant and keep him for a couple of days and it caused such a protective terror that Perry was willing to do anything to alleviate it. \"Did he have any sign of injuries?\" \"Nothing apparent,\" Leyvas started to say. \"We didn't -\" \" Any sign of injuries,\" Perry said, lowering his voice and putting enough emphasis on the words to make himself clear. Leyvas gave him a harder look. \"Someone roofied him but didn't take his wallet,\" Perry said. \"Check him over again. All of him, this time. Please.\" Leyvas nodded shortly. \"Understood. Right now he's too stable for us to keep him, beyond that, but he could change fast. Bring him back or call 911 if he does.\" He took Harry home half an hour later with the relief of knowing there wasn't a scratch on the kid, and a printout of things to watch out for, because there were too many things that could go wrong. Business as usual. Harry was quiet in the car, or at least quieter than usual; he hummed aimlessly to himself and seemed to be fascinated with his seatbelt, plucking at it and staring at any passing light with unblinking, amazed eyes. Perry felt as if he was waiting for some sort of explosion, for Harry to do something completely unforeseeable. Jesus, he'd dealt with doped up friends before, many times, but this was different. He hadn't felt guilt over it, any other time, or as if he'd allowed something in his care to be mishandled. He didn't feel like that, didn't do these things, didn't behave this way, for anyone. He wondered, again, how he'd ended up there, with this random, semi-adult, absentminded bit of fluff that he was babysitting, for crissakes. His life had been simple and orderly and all his until he'd let Dabney talk him into pretending to train yet another 'actor'. Harry is my friend and we're here now because I fucked this up. And Harry was probably going to forgive him for it, whether he remembered anything about it or not. Harry started to laugh as if he'd just heard the funniest joke in the world, tipping over and leaning against the car door. \"Hey,\" Perry said, wishing the car had child proof locks on it. \"Stay with me here, Chief.\" Harry kept leaning against the door, but he angled his head to look at Perry. \"Perry,\" he said. His voice sounded relieved and excited at the same time. \"When did you get here?\" \"A while ago,\" Perry said. \"The funniest fucking thing happened,\" Harry said. \"Ever. Really. It was so great.\" \"What was it?\" \"I have no idea,\" Harry said. \"Wow, you are all, like, sideways and shit. Are you an acrobat, today?\" \"Sit up straight, idiot,\" Perry said. \"What's your middle name?\" \"Emerson,\" Harry said. Perry wanted to make some comment about it, but Harry wasn't in any condition to verbally spar with him, and that took the fun out of it. Plus, he'd already known Harry's middle name after running a background check on him months earlier. Harry was wasted, but wasn't missing much of his higher brain function, because he was answering quickly without getting disoriented. He hadn't been roofied that hard, then, just enough to make him compliant enough to kidnap. That shit tended to kick in 15-20 minutes after ingestion, especially with alcohol, and would have knocked Harry for a loop long enough to give the E time to kick in a while later. \"You have to tell me if you start feeling like it's too hot in here, okay?\" Perry said. \"I love you,\" Harry said. \"You know that, right? God, I love you. You are great .\" \"And this is the part where I remember that E makes people get all affectionate,\" Perry said. \"My least favorite part.\" \"You're the best friend I've ever had,\" Harry said. \"That's the saddest thing anyone's ever said to me, Harry,\" Perry said, and he heard the guilt he felt as he said it. \"I mean it, it's like, this whole thing, where I accidentally ended up out here and found Harmony and all that stuff happened and here we are, right, all of us, it's just destiny.\" \"No, you and Harmony can be destiny-bound all you want,\" Perry said. \"You keep me out of that equation.\" \"I really, really love you,\" Harry said. \"Do anything for you.\" \"We've been through this,\" Perry said, gripping the steering wheel until he could feel the tendons in his hands and wrists ache with the strain. \"The fact that you'll say it sober and wasted just makes me think I should have you committed. Aren't you tired? Why don't you just close your eyes and get some rest?\" Harry was sitting up again and had gone back to staring at the passing lights with open fascination. \"Wow.\" / / / It wasn't hard to get him into the house. Harry was staring at the sky, at the two or three stars that the light pollution didn't mask, and let himself be guided by one elbow. Once inside, he danced to unheard music, spinning to something dizzy and beyond the understanding of any typical, inhibited, drugless mind. Perry debated calling Harmony and decided not to, because she'd want to come over and he wouldn't really be able to keep her from doing it. She didn't need to see Harry like that, and she sure as hell didn't need to try and deal with Harry like that. She wasn't responsible for it. He was. He gave Harry a bottle of water and then set a desk toy in front of him on the counter, some stupid disc-thing a client had given him. It was laser-etched to catch light as it spun and make insane rainbows out of it along the surface. Harry stared with rapt enjoyment, lips parted. He looked about five years old, suddenly, and Perry was almost sorry he'd done it. \"There you go, Chief,\" he said. \"Later on we'll see if Teletubbies is on. I hear that's a big favorite with the rave set.\" Harry played with the disc for an hour . Perry made coffee, knowing it was going to be a long night, then sat and watched him for a while, unable to stop. Harry was rocking slightly, eyes darting around like he might miss something, hands flat on the counter, eyes huge and bright. Perry went and made sure everything was locked up, then put things in front of all doors and most doorways in the interest of being alerted should his excessively doped roommate try to explore. He checked his messages. Nothing but a couple of follow-up case details that had nothing to do with Maslin. He went back out to the kitchen and took the colorful disc away from Harry, and told him to drink the damn water. Harry seemed to snap awake a little, and he looked around. \"When did I get home?\" \"Little while ago. Listen, Harry - Harry. Harry .\" Harry finally locked eyes on him and then stared, unblinking. He got up from the bar and came around the counter toward Perry, one hand sliding across the slick surface for support, getting right into Perry's space and gazing up at him. The dilated pupils would normally have turned him off, but it only made Harry's eyes seem impossibly bigger, his focus more intense. \"You are so beautiful,\" Harry said breathlessly. \"You don't even know.\" \"You're wasted,\" Perry said, trying to ignore the zing of discomfort he felt. \"You don't even know,\" Harry said again. \"I see you.\" \"You have no idea who I am,\" Perry said. \"Let it go, Harry. Just ride it out.\" Harry came up close against Perry, face pressed into his chest. \"I feel so, so good,\" he whispered. \"I know,\" Perry said, running a hand through Harry's hair, feeling him shudder. \"It's okay. I need to ask you some questions.\" \"Okay.\" \"Did he do anything to you?\" Perry said, leaving his hand tangled in Harry's hair. \"Maslin. Did he…touch you?\" Just because there weren't injuries didn't mean nothing had happened. And there was no way Harry was going to remember a lot of what had happened later, with the cocktail he was riding. Harry was rubbing his face along Perry's shirt. \"Kissed me,\" Harry said. \"Wasn't great. You try it.\" \"No,\" Perry said deliberately. \"I have standards. And morals. Most of the time. Did he say anything to you that you can remember?\" \"Hmm. Said it was good to get so much warning. And there was something about…he said he meant it, he'd take me along. I said, sorry, I loooooove Perry.\" Perry sighed. \"So he dropped me off but I got really lost and then Violet and Bunny came along, and -\" \" Violet and Bunny ?\" Perry said with flat incredulity. \"Really?\" \"They were so great.\" \"You have the worst and best luck, simultaneously, of anyone I've ever seen,\" Perry said, ignoring the fact that he still had his hand in Harry's hair. Harry continued to rub his face into Perry's shirt. \"Why don't you go lie down?\" Perry said finally, and it came out sounding much gentler than he'd intended. \"Not tired.\" Great. The next couple of hours sucked. Harry wandered aimlessly through the house, touching surfaces like they were something new and fascinating. Fingertips were brushed along walls, furniture, countertops. The look on his face was ecstatic wonder. He was obviously getting something out of every encounter, something that should have been ridiculous but managed to come off as sensual and evocative. He rubbed his face and most of his upper body along the back of the couch like a cat, eyes distant with some inner rapture. Perry would take another bullet before saying so, but it was beautiful. Harry like that was beautiful. He felt a moment of self loathing for thinking so, even though it had little to do with Harry's maleness. It had more to do with Harry's Harryness . It was the penultimate version of the person who fished moths out of pools, who saved damsels in distress, who tried to breathe life back into near-strangers lying in the street. This was bad, this was the fucking worst scenario involving Harry that Perry could imagine, because Harry was damn near helpless when he was perfectly sane and sober, and suddenly he was wandering around Perry's house ten times as helpless but also beautiful and begging to be touched. Perry tried to keep an eye on him without really looking at him. Making further eye contact was out of the question. Harry focused on him occasionally anyway and gravitated toward him, and Perry warded him off as gently as he could. You smell so good. Harry pressed against him and breathed deep, moaned low and shameless. Harry was stupidly affectionate on a regular basis as it was. He'd previously allowed Perry to clap a hand over his mouth without the slightest struggle, kiss him without getting a knee in the balls, slap him without any defensive retaliation. Harry like this was ten times worse, accommodating and sweet. Perry used those moments to feel Harry's skin and check for hyperthermia. E was famous for that. If Harry got too hot, things were going to get bad. He knew it. So he broke it up every time Harry tried to start dancing even though there was no music; he was hearing something. He just kept telling him that white, straight boys couldn't dance, and Harry would laugh and fall against him. Open mouthed patterns were made on the glass of his living room windows. Harry made breath-patterns of mist and then giggled, drawing aimless figures like a child, tic-tac-toe and stick people. He pressed his entire body against the glass and his eyes grew even more distant, whispers drifting like ghosts, tales told slow and soft and unheard against the cold, smooth surface. He murmured something into the distance, breath and moisture mingled, and Perry wasn't brave enough to ask. Perry drank more coffee and fidgeted. He left a message for Dabney, that Maslin had made a break for it. He didn't give details. He would never tell anyone about this, not about all of it. He would tell Harmony that Harry had been roofied on a bar surveillance, if it came to that, and that was it. He had damn near bullied Harry into the whole thing, even though Harry loved this shit and was always trying to get into the middle of everything. Harry wanted to be useful. Harry came along again and broke him out of his thoughts. \"Hey, Slick.\" \"Hey, Chief. You tired yet?\" \"No.\" Harry stood there and smiled and swayed, never still in his sober moments and twice as bad under a mix of drugs. His shirt was open by several buttons and his hair stood out in all directions, making him look mildly debauched. \"You okay? Still feel good?\" Harry's smile widened. \"Want some water? I won't play twenty questions with you, Harry.\" \"Do we have any pop?\" Harry said. \"It's 'soda' out here, idiot,\" Perry said, wanting the contact enough to argue over stupid, pointless shit. He was still concentrating on Harry's use of 'we' and 'home' like they were lifelines. \"Do we have anything cold and sweet ?\" Harry said, and Perry knew he half meant it and was half trying to be lascivious. \"Diet Coke, shithead,\" Perry said. Harry looked at him expectantly. Perry went to the fridge and reached in for a can, holding it out to Harry impatiently. In his head, it felt more like he was holding out a treat to a wild animal. Harry came within arm's length and took it, snapping it open and then drinking half of it. Perry watched his throat work and waited to see what would happen. Harry put the can on the counter and wandered away again. Perry suppressed a sigh of relief. \"Why don't you go lie down for awhile?\" he said. \"You're tired, right?\" Harry looked at him for a moment like he'd had some sort of revelation. \"Let's go swimming,\" he said. \"No, Harry. No swimming. Maybe ever. Swimming is not allowed in California.\" Harry frowned a little but seemed to deal with the concept. \"Fucking red tide,\" Harry said. \"Yeah, exactly. Sure.\" \"That was a Rush song,\" Harry said. \"I think. They're from Canada.\" \"Why don't you go have a shower?\" Perry said. \"That's second place to swimming.\" Harry stared at him, and Perry was afraid they'd have another session of half-cuddling or whatever the hell it was. Harry focused his attention elsewhere, though, and decided to explore the house a little more. Perry let him go, with relief. He checked the news, hoping Maslin had been hit by a semi or something and was currently dying a fiery death on some freeway. We was out of luck. He made more coffee and was glad Dabney hadn't fronted him a retainer on this one, because he'd have had to give it back anyway. It had been quiet for too long. A quiet Harry was a bad thing. He went down the hall and checked Harry's room, then started checking each room. Nothing. Not until he got to his own room, the one place Harry had been warned away from repeatedly. He stared, aroused and horrified and sympathetic. Harry was on his bed, shirt on the floor, writhing mindlessly on the silk sheets, lost in the sensation alone. Knowing he was being damn near voyeuristic, he half-closed the door and went back out to the kitchen to lean against the counter with his palms pressed against his eyes. Jesus, seriously. He waited a few minutes, then went to check again, and Harry was out like a light, spread out over as much of the bed as he could get. His breathing was a little rapid, but he didn't seem to be any warmer than he needed to be. Perry went back out and settled himself on the couch, flipping channels to calm himself, trying to pretend everything was normal. Not much else he could do until morning. At least Harry had settled down. It felt like moments later when he startled awake, and he lifted his head with a sense of anxiety. He checked his watch. He'd been out for about twenty minutes. Harry. Where was Harry? He stalked through the house, not daring to shout for him, afraid of what he might find. Or not find. The house was empty. He immediately went for the driveway. Harry was outside, a silhouette against off-orange streetlights. Naked, as the day he was born. Harry's clothes were strewn from the doorway to the driveway, flung off one piece at a time. Perry made quick, purposeful strides to where he stood. Harry whispered something unintelligible without looking at him. \"Are you -\" Perry didn't get to finish. Harry's breath came too quickly, a low panting between words. He looked up at Perry with eyes that were far too bright for the lack of light. \"Help.\" / / / Harry's temp reached 106.3. / / / Perry had no problem swinging Harry into his arms and getting him into the bathroom and running a tub of cool - not cold - water. Heat was radiating off his skin but he clung to Perry and shivered like he was freezing. Once Harry hit the water, however, his cooperation ended. Perry had braced himself, but there was no bracing oneself against someone who was drugged, crazed with fever, and panicking. Harry had already been wiry and quick, and in his right mind would still have been something to deal with under the right circumstances. As it was, it was like dealing with a flailing, squalling, Harry-sized cat . \" Harry! Harry, calm down, dammit, it's just -\" No reasoning with him, either. Harry got in one lucky shot, to Perry's nose with a struggling elbow, and it wasn't bad enough to break anything but it stung like no one's business. Perry tried to hold him down with his eyes tightly shut against the pain and shock, knowing that if Harry kept struggling it was only going to be worse for them both. Then Harry started shrieking. Completely unnerved, Perry started the shower so that Harry was going to get cooled down no matter what, then got into the tub with him and wrapped his arms around the struggling form, getting soaked with him and shivering with the mixture of cold and worry. Harry ran out of energy quickly after that, shivering along with Perry, screams dying to low sobs as he stayed tense against Perry's chest. Perry had never felt so sorry for someone in his whole life. He made hushing sounds over the sound of the shower, cool water beating against his clothes and streaming down his face, holding Harry almost too tightly just to keep him still; Harry's too-hot skin nearly burned him through cloth. Harry was nearly unresponsive once he was cool enough to remove from the water. All his energy went into shivering. After a perfunctory towel-off, Perry put Harry in his bed, onto the same silk sheets he'd been so enamored of earlier. It was the first time since puberty that he'd been to bed with a guy and not fucked him . Harry wrapped himself in tight, arms and legs, nearly suffocating them both with how badly he needed the contact. Perry just held on, knowing he owed Harry at least that much. He drifted off once or twice only to startle awake any time Harry made the slightest noise or motion. Harry stayed cool and breathed evenly and didn't die. When he woke again, it was getting light, and Harry had retreated to the other side of the bed. Perry stared at the ceiling as the light changed, thinking about how he should have been right back on the case last night and trying to track Maslin down, figured out where he'd gone and finished what he'd set out to do. But he had dropped everything for Harry. He tried to tell himself that didn't mean anything, that it was just a combination of his own guilt and Harry's patent helplessness. He rolled out of bed and checked for messages, checked in with the cops (no hit on the APB) and wondered how pissed Dabney was going to be. He decided he didn't care. He finished up some casework on something they'd wrapped a few days earlier, making out what he could of Harry's notes and filing the report away. Somewhere around nine, he tried to wake Harry and make him deal with toast and juice, but Harry wasn't interested in lifting his head, much less eating anything. He was too out of it, and he never quite woke up enough to do more than blink and nod. Perry let him sleep it off. He did the math in his head, and figured the worst of it was just finally beginning to wear off. The drugs he knew about, anyway. Dabney called at about 10:30. Perry gave him a brief rundown. Dabney really didn't need to know more than 'the asshole drugged my employee and dumped him in an alley'. \"Yeah, he does that,\" Dabney said. Perry let a long beat of silence pass. \"Say again?\" \"Maslin roofies just about everybody he comes near,\" Dabney said, and Perry could hear him shuffling paper in the background like what he'd just said was perfectly normal. \"Everybody knows that.\" \"It would have been nice to know that just a little earlier,\" Perry said, tone sharp with sarcasm. \"Well, what the fuck, Perry,\" Dabney said. \"You're the detective. I figured you'd have done a little research.\" Perry wasn't sure who he hated more right about then - Maslin, Dabney, or himself. / / / When he tried to wake Harry at noon to make him drink something, anything, Harry was marginally more lucid for nearly a minute. \"I'm naked in your bed,\" he said slowly. \"Is that good or bad?\" \"You remember anything?\" Perry said, tugging Harry up enough to handle the bottle of water he offered. Harry winced at the daylight coming in the southern-facing window and sipped at the water before downing half of it like he'd been in the desert. Perry grabbed it back, worried Harry might throw it right back up. Harry looked at him like he'd completely lost the train of their conversation. \"What?\" \"Do you remember anything?\" Harry wavered a little, eyes darting around the room. \"Little bits. I didn't want to go with him, I swear.\" \"I know,\" Perry said. \"Don't worry about it. He drugged the shit out of you.\" Harry nodded a little and frowned. \"Did you try to drown me?\" \"Yes,\" Perry said. \"Okay. I gotta piss.\" Perry gave his unsteady roommate a hand out of bed and then studiously ignored him from the shoulders down. He hung around outside the bathroom door. \"If you fall in there and crack your head open, I'm going to really drown you this time,\" he said. Harry thought that was funny and snorted with laughter. \"What the fuck am I on? I am so hung over.\" \"We'll talk about it later.\" Harry came out, hairline damp from washing his face. \"Should I go get in my own bed?\" he said. \"No.\" Harry meandered back to bed with only one misstep, but he managed not to tumble. He pulled the covers up and hunkered down until his head was mostly covered. \"Why are you being so nice to me? I fucked up.\" \"You didn't,\" Perry said. \"And I'm not being nice. You're imagining all of this.\" Harry made a humming noise and remained still. / / / Perry tried to get some work done while keeping an ear out for Harry. The cops found Maslin's car abandoned in Tahoe. It was no small stretch to think he'd fled the country. Wasn't his case anymore. / / / Harmony called around three. \"I just got in. Tell me how the big date went. Was he adorable?\" \"He was,\" Perry said. \"Too adorable. The mark made him and drugged him.\" \"Oh, shit. Perry, goddamnit! Is he okay?\" \"Yeah,\" Perry said, sighing a little to himself. \"I would have tracked you down if he wasn't. He's just a little hung over and he's gotta sleep it off. Come see him tomorrow when he's human again. I don't think he can stand a lot of attention right now.\" \"You'd better not blame him for this,\" Harmony said. \"There's no way he would have seen this coming, and you are way too hard on him.\" \"I don't blame him,\" Perry said. \"Okay? Yell at me later, I feel bad enough as it is. I know he doesn't know better.\" She paused. \"Are you okay? You don't sound like yourself.\" \"There are maybe three days a year I'm not an asshole, Harmony, and I'm using one today,\" he said. \"You were scared,\" Harmony said, like it was a revelation. \"I have never seen you scared, even while you were being shot at. What else happened?\" \"I'm just tired,\" Perry said. \"Anyone would be after a night of dealing with sober Harry. Drugged-up Harry is way too much Harry.\" He heard her snort a little. \"Okay, if that's all it is. Are you sure I should wait until tomorrow?\" \"He's too out of it to talk,\" Perry said. \"Let him come down a ways and it'll be fine.\" \"It's cute when you get all protective of him,\" she said. Her tone was only partly teasing. \"No idea what the fuck you're talking about.\" She laughed and said right, whatever, and the conversation was over. Perry made something simple for dinner with the intention of enticing Harry with it, but he didn't have to. Harry shuffled out around six, sleepy-eyed and fully dressed. His face was blank and Perry didn't take that as a good sign. He watched Harry climb onto a barstool at the counter with exaggerated care before he slid a bottle of water over to him. Harry took it with marked disinterest and sipped at it. Perry restrained himself from coming around the counter to feel his skin and see what temp he was. \"Tell me how you feel,\" Perry said instead. \"And I mean, in full sentences, with many details, as if you were on a stakeout on yourself.\" Harry frowned over that for a moment, but it appeared to make sense to him. \"Disconnected,\" he said. \"Thirsty, like, all over thirsty, and tired, and not like myself, meaning everything seems really far away and I don't really care about it right now.\" \"Okay,\" Perry said, turning away to turn off the stove. \"That's a good start. Hot, cold? Hurt anywhere?\" \"Back hurts a little,\" Harry said dully. \"Not running a fever or anything. I just feel bad, like something bad happened but I can't remember what it was. Did something bad happen?\" \"Just that Maslin grabbed you and dragged you around for awhile after doping you,\" Perry said, coming closer to lean his elbows against the opposite side of the counter. He looked Harry over carefully, and Harry looked as sad as he sounded. \"You're coming down off what he doped you with, which is pretty normal. He started with E - you know what that is? - and then he tossed a few other things in, which made it worse.\" \"He made me,\" Harry said, then clarified once he realized Perry looked worried and confused. \"I mean, he made my cover. Long before I got there. It never occurred to me that he'd put something in my drink.\" \"Me either, if it's any consolation,\" Perry said. Harry took a deep breath and glanced around like he was trying to reacquaint himself with reality. \"How long did he have me?\" Perry paused, and Harry was just lucid enough to catch it. He refocused on Perry and looked hard. \"Jesus, Perry, how long did he have me?\" \"Couple of hours, before he dropped you off near Glassell Park,\" Perry said, eyes on the counter. \"Long enough to scare you a little?\" Harry said. \"I remember him finding the wire and telling me you said it was okay to leave with him and get in the car, and I couldn't get my shit together.\" Perry's mouth was set into a line that said there was some emotion trying to get loose. \"I remember…him ranting at me about something, partly about you and mostly about his boss, I was trying to make sense of it, and then he kept trying to get me to say I'd go with him wherever the fuck he was going. He started yelling about how he was sorry about Matt but he didn't have any choice.\" \"Matt,\" Perry said. Harry nodded. \"I knew I was doped, but I couldn't seem to do anything about it and I didn't agree to anything. He didn't do anything to me, but I think…for a little while there, it seemed like he was gearing up to do something. Which one of you said I had 'the ass of a sixteen year old track star'?\" \"That was me,\" Perry said shortly. \"Good, I wasn't sure where that came from anymore,\" Harry said. \"He kept reaching for me and then would back off, it was really fucked up. He broke my phone, did you find it?\" Perry nodded. \"Yeah, Chief, I did.\" \"I don't remember being dropped off, but I kind of remember Bunny and Violet. They were nice, and then you showed up, and I was so glad, and after that it's mainly…lights and everything being fucking beautiful and feeling really, really good until the cold water. Why did you dunk me in cold water?\" \"Your brain was frying,\" Perry said, tone clipped. Harry waited. Perry didn't have anything to add, so he waited too. Harry kept looking at him narrowly. \" What .\" Harry blinked. \"This is the part where you're supposed to say 'it didn't make any difference' or 'a little frying might be an improvement for you', or whatever.\" \"Not much about this was funny, Harry,\" Perry said. \"I fucked this up,\" Harry said. \"I'm sorry, I thought -\" \"No,\" Perry said quickly, cutting him off. \"That's not what I meant. I didn't catch on in time, and I told you I'd watch your back. He could have really hurt you, and he almost did. I'm sorry.\" Harry stared at him like he didn't know him. \"C'mon, I want you to eat something,\" Perry said, turning away again. \"I'm not sure I -\" \"Eat. Something. Now.\" Harry dutifully picked at what was put in front of him (turkey was good after a run-in with E; anything with tryptophan was), and Perry knew all too well that he had no appetite. He'd done E before, for fun, and at the best it was just a lack of appetite. With whatever else Harry had been dosed with against his will, it had to be worse. They watched tv for awhile, and Harry dozed off again. When he woke, he was thirsty and mildly disoriented and as close to morose as Perry thought Harry was capable of getting. Crashing. Perry gave him water and then sent the kid back to his own bed because that was likely the only thing he was going to do right for Harry, out of the whole mess. Harry still hadn't asked him many questions, and Perry was grateful. / / / When he went in to get Harry up the next morning, Harry was already awake and staring at him with large, dark eyes, head off the pillow, lying prone and half-covered, hands loosely curled. Perry didn't say anything for a moment. Then he entered and sat on the edge of the bed. \"Why am I so sad?\" Harry said, voice low and hoarse. \"The drugs used up all the serotonin you had at once,\" Perry said. He clasped his hands in his lap and tried to make it look casual instead of what it really was: a struggle not to touch. Harry seemed to mull that over. \"So I used all the…happiness I had, in one night?\" \"It'll be back,\" Perry said. \"Give it a couple of days and eat a lot of turkey and bananas and you'll be you again.\" Harry turned over and blinked at him expectantly, but Perry kept his gaze slightly to one side of his face. He'd passed up another perfect opportunity to be sarcastic, and he knew it. \"How long until you're you again?\" Harry said softly. \"Because every hour that goes by that you don't call me an idiot or insult me kind of makes it worse.\" Perry shook his head. He had a whole lecture to give, there, on how fucked up that was. He'd asked Harry many times, generally out of anger, what the fuck was wrong with him, and neither of them had an answer. He patted Harry stiffly and absently on one hip and rose to go. \"Come out and eat something,\" he said. \"Have a shower. You'll feel better. Harmony's coming over. That'll cheer you up.\" / / / It did cheer him up. Harmony came in and kissed Perry, and there was no recrimination in her face, just a little bit of pity and something a little sly, like she'd figured something out and wasn't going to say anything about it. Perry rolled his eyes. Harry and Harmony went to the beach. Later that afternoon a small portion of the feeling of doom lifted as his head cleared a little further, and it was replaced with worry about how hard Perry was taking everything. A small, generic thank-you notecard with no return address was in the mail when Perry went to pick it up. The postmark was from Tahoe, a day earlier. Perry, The moment I saw your sidekick, I figured you were around. Thanks for the sacrificial lamb. It would have been fun to break him in, but I decided distracting you would be more useful. I'm sure it was an interesting night or two. If I ever see him again, I'm going to really break him. Kind of a sweet kid. What's he doing hanging out with you? It was unsigned. Perry wasn't surprised. The problem was, he'd gotten a little complacent and jaded about what it took to really take down the typical idiot in LA, and he had not only misjudged Maslin, he'd been distracted long before Harry had been drugged. Harry was already known. Perry should have realized it, realized that the whole goddamn town already had him made as Perry's sidekick . As Perry's anything . / / / When Harry got back, Perry was gone. There was dinner in the fridge and a note on the counter. Stakeout. Don't wait up. Shit, really? He felt a little off and knew Perry wasn't going to clear him to work again until he was 100%, or whatever passed for that, but this wasn't how they did things. As pissed as he was, he still let it rest for a couple of days. Even he knew, sometimes, when to let something sit. He let Perry avoid him, and let him make awkward conversation when he couldn't. He screwed with the coffee pot. He changed all the settings. Nothing happened. He spent the extra time pulling things from Perry's bookshelves. He didn't want to borrow Harmony's Johnny Gossamers because he didn't think he could crack them open ever again. There were actually encyclopedias , for fuck's sake, and a series of something that looked like thinly veiled gay romance, and sets of books on poisons, crime scene investigation, fingerprinting. Some of them were seriously old, like Perry was a collector. Real private detective shit. Harry felt a moment of minor hero worship. Again. By process of elimination, he ended up with some old volume of Sherlock Holmes stories. He'd had to read Hound of the Baskervilles in school and all he remembered was there was some dog killing people, and it hadn't sucked more than anything else he'd had to read in school. If it would make Perry happy in any way, he would try it. / / / That crazy shit turned out to be hilariously interesting. And, man. Perry was not the world's first gay detective. / / / He didn't exactly pick the best time to jump in with both feet, but he wasn't sure when that would have been anyway. He watched Perry move around the office upstairs, staking him out. He knew Perry knew he was there, because Perry's shoulders were stiff, but he didn't get called on it. That was bad, too; Perry should have yelled at him or at least told him to fuck off. He stalked up to Perry's desk. \"You told me I didn't fuck up. And I'm all drug-free now. So how come I'm not even filing shit? Am I fired?\" Perry raised his eyebrows without looking up at him. \"According to you, you didn't officially work here anyway, remember?\" \"Hilarious. Are we still roommates, then, or are you just gonna ignore me until I go away?\" \"Are you going to be a girl about this?\" Perry said, continuing to focus on paperwork. \"I thought you'd love a vacation.\" \"This isn't a vacation,\" Harry snapped. \"This is being sidelined. This is bullshit.\" \"Well, your current career path isn't doing much more than almost getting you killed on a regular basis,\" Perry said. \"Might wanna try something less dangerous, like shark baiting or joining a militia.\" \"I agreed to do the thing with Maslin!\" Perry stilled. \"I didn't give you much choice, Harry.\" Harry shook his head. \"You were heavy handed, but you always are, and I'm not scared of you. Except when you're acting like you might kill me, but even then, I'm not exactly scared, it's more like I don't want to get pummeled, I hate getting the shit beaten out of me, it sucks. So I could have come up with another plan if I didn't like yours. I just let you persuade me.\" Perry slammed his hands down on his desk, flinching when Harry did. \"That's bullshit,\" he snapped, finally looking at him. \"You've told me one too many times that you'd do anything for me. What the fuck is that? I don't want that from you.\" \"That's pretty much what you're getting anyway,\" Harry shot back. \"I'm sorry, what? I'm some fucking loser you took in . What the fuck did you do that for? I've got a job and a better life and I get to be close to Harmony, because of you. I'd be in jail or dead by now, otherwise, the way I was headed.\" Perry just shook his head. \"That's why you let me get away with so much?\" he said. \"No. Because we're friends, and you'll never really hurt me,\" Harry said. \"You won't. I can feel it.\" Perry felt a shiver he couldn't fully suppress. \"You were so nervous about Maslin because you knew what he was like, you could tell,\" he said. \"You're a good judge of character most of the time, aren't you. It's what's kept you alive all this time.\" Harry shrugged. Perry slumped back in his chair, looking mildly defeated. \"I'll wash your hair, if you want,\" he said. \"Oh my God,\" Harry said, tipping his head back and closing his eyes. \"You're turning me gay.\" \"Oh, you're doing that all on your own, Harry,\" Perry said. \"Don't think of it as gay. Think of it as an 'alternative lifestyle'. Plus, you said there was nothing wrong with it.\" \"There isn't,\" Harry said. \"Because it's you.\" He tilted his head forward again and stared at Perry, but Perry didn't meet his eyes. Couldn't. \"I would do anything for you,\" Harry said. \"You're the best friend I've ever had.\" Perry wished that didn't frighten him so. He grimaced and dug the heel of one hand into an eye. \"I'm so sorry,\" he said. \"No,\" Harry said. \"C'mon. That wasn't your fault. There was no way -\" \"Harry,\" Perry said gently, and Harry fell silent. No shouting, this once, no hands-over-mouths. \"Shut up. It was my fault.\" They were silent for a long moment, registering at least an 8 on the awkward scale by Perry's estimation. He got up and came around the desk and looked out the window so he could turn his back to Harry for a minute and get some distance. Harry fidgeted for a moment more, then said, \"It was worth a wound.\" Perry turned and stared at him, finally meeting his eyes. He could tell by the look in Harry's eyes that the jackass had gone out of his way to not only listen, but to try to join in. He smirked a little in acknowledgment and tried not to encourage him too much. \"Being forced to suck face with that asshole was on a level with getting shot?\" Harry snorted. \"He was never the first guy to kiss me, anyway, right?\" Perry stepped forward and grabbed him. He took Harry's face in both hands, cradled him close, and pulled him in. Harry fell into it without struggle, just acceded to Perry's wishes; he trusted so hard that Perry felt it like a blow. Harry was trusting, but not this trusting, not with five priors and two stints in jail, not with an ex wife and a life in New York. This was trust in its purest form, lodged in his gut, with no fear or hesitation. He gave Harry a moment to back away, to shove him off, but he never did. He just blinked up at him and waited. When lips met, Harry never shied away, just pressed in closer, hands tangling in Perry's shirt, mouth opening when Perry drew his tongue against his lower lip. Asking, not telling, soft and respectful. Harry actually let him in. For a real kiss, it was heartfelt and messy, nothing like the movies and everything like real life, a press of lips and teeth and tongues, meaning more than most things. Harry tasted of fear and need, coffee and cigarettes, personal and desperate and loved. Perry had never wanted anything so badly in his life. It couldn't happen, but he could have this, just this once. Someone else had kissed Harry, with all the wrong intent and for all the wrong reasons, and he had to clear it away with this, with something real. Harry moaned into it, pressing in, hands clenched into Perry's clothes, pulling himself in deeper. Perry felt himself respond and knew that was the end, that unless he quit, it was no longer something soothing and claiming and cleansing but would become everything and god please yes. He gently pulled away and was met with resistance. \"You're okay,\" Perry whispered against Harry's mouth. \"You're okay.\" A return whisper, a further press of lips. \"Perry -\" Goddamnit. So needy, so there . \"Now I'm the first and last guy to ever kiss you,\" Perry said. He leaned in for another quick, full meeting of mouths, then set Harry away from him, trying to ignore the sleepy-stunned-aroused look on Harry's face. \"You got that?\" Harry nodded quickly, swallowing hard enough that Perry could hear it. Perry walked away from him, because if he didn't put some distance between them then and there, they would be something else . Harry watched him walk away, fingers pressed against his own lips, stunned into letting it happen. / / / Perry looked close into the life of Matthew Caldwell, Maslin's last ex, without being open about it. IHe started yelling about how he was sorry about Matt but he didn't have any choice./I Perry had waved a red flag at a lunatic without realizing he was doing it, without taking care to understand that he was doing it. Matt, Harry's height and build with dark, clueless-looking eyes and dark lashes. Matt, who'd vanished after leaving a bar in West LA three months earlier with someone who wasn't Maslin. There'd been an investigation, but there wasn't much close family around to care, and the one night stand had been able to produce a decent alibi. A skeleton matching the basic description had been found in the Nevada desert with bones showing at least 14 knife marks. No teeth. Not conclusive, but enough for Perry. Harry didn't resist or make a remark of any kind when Perry grabbed him as he walked by and hugged him. It was brief and rough and still completely un-Perry like, but Harry wrapped arms around and took it for what it was: free affection. / / / \"Oh my God, that's Violet!\" Perry slowed immediately. They had been looking for nearly a week and he'd been ready to call it off because not even he was arrogant enough to keep prowling around Avenues territory with any impunity. Harry barely waited for him to come to a full stop before he jumped out with the flowers. For all his lack of grace and propriety, though, all the enthusiasm, he approached carefully. Perry closed the door and didn't mind that he didn't hear the words that followed; Harry was all shy gratefulness and the look of recognition on the woman's face was payoff enough. He was hugged, and got his hair ruffled, and was generally fussed over. She took the flowers with a fond look, kissing Harry's cheek. Harry's blush reached his ears. A New Yorker, now LA transplant, who could still blush. \"Fuck me running,\" Perry murmured. He took a deep, audible breath. \"You, Perry, are currently in possession of a fucking unicorn .\" Harry bounced from foot to foot and shrugged, and when he finally came back to the car he looked a little more settled and content. Perry waited until he got buckled in. \"So when, exactly, do you start shooting rainbows out of your ass?\" The confusion was as cute as everything else. Perry wondered if they made a microwave big enough to put Harry in. \"Never mind. Feel better?\" Harry sighed contentedly. \"Yeah, actually,\" he said. \"In a lot of ways.\" / / / Perry knew better. He knew better. No cute, straight morons, no hoping , no waiting. But God, it would be good. Love was involved for once, and he'd catalogue every breath, figure out what made Harry lose his mind. Harry was of the kind that would throw himself into it, give himself over in so many ways, for so many reasons. Harry made him laugh, reminded him of what was good in the world. He hadn't thought there was anyone or anything that could bring that back to him. One day, maybe, Harry and Harmony would stop working and just go back to being friends. He didn't expect it; but he could wait. And hope. Just this once. / / / / / / ","Summary":" Anytime Soon ©2010 gekizetsu Perry should never have made Harry go undercover, even if it was suppo"},{"Movie":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang","Title":"Something Ridiculous","Author":"devotfeige","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9228726","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It's as unspectacular a venue as it is an entirely forgettable event, late one night while they're watching a marathon of dumb old action movies together on the couch. Harry falling asleep by about the third film isn't terribly uncommon, and sheer proximity leaves him snoring softly against Perry's shoulder as often as not, but tonight is different if for no other reason than that when Harry curls against his side in his sleep, Perry happens to glance at him and realize how used to this he's become. It isn't an earth-shattering revelation, nor even a particularly surprising one, but it's meaningful all the same: it's difficult to imagine life without Harry, anymore. He mulls that thought over for a long while, watching the movie drag on with detached interest as he shifts his arm around the other man to settle him more comfortably against his side. The credits are rolling and he's nearing exhaustion himself when Harry murmurs in his sleep, fingers tensing into the material of Perry's shirt, which he covers with his own hand almost reflexively. Harry stills, quiets, and gradually drifts back into more peaceful slumber while Perry studies the rise and fall of both their hands atop his chest, little finger covering the space where Harry's missing ring finger would be. A whim is all, just to see what it might look like: Perry slides his ring off of his own finger to adorn what's left of Harry's, and though he'd never admit to it aloud there's a sentimental side of him that warms considerably at the sight of it. In and of itself it's a meaningless gesture, but it carries with it connotations that he wouldn't have to imagine a day without the strange, indomitable force of nature that has become such a constant fixture in his life. In the space before sleep, he allows himself such fanciful daydreams; they'll be buried come morning. Perry awakes to an empty room and thinks nothing of it, but for the crick in his neck from sleeping on the couch. Coffee's already on when he makes his way into the kitchen, though, so there's still hope for the morning yet. It's afternoon before Harry crosses paths with him again, edging into the room like a stray animal that's not entirely convinced of its welcome but just daring or stupid enough to try anyway. \"You, uh— here, this is...\" Harry holds up the ring in offering, looking admonished even before Perry can recognize the thing. It takes a moment, while he's nattering on incessantly, but it isn't a stretch to realize that Harry's probably convinced himself he pilfered it in some ill-advised drunken heist of his own home. \"...yours. I think. Isn't it? I found it earlier and thought you might, y'know. Want it back.\" \"It doesn't matter,\" Perry answers over the slap of a folder hitting the surface of his desk, inexplicably irritated by his own mawkishness. \"Do whatever you want with it.\" He stands and dismisses Harry with a wave of his hand in the same motion, deciding abruptly that he's long past overdue for a half-day and that business isn't anywhere near booming enough for early closing to cut into anything important. Harry just fidgets in the doorway, giving him a look like he can't quite decide whether or not to blurt out whatever's on his mind. Miraculously, he opts for silence, shrugging when Perry glares at him for loitering in the doorway and then disappearing out into the hall. Harry doesn't wait up for him, that night. He's asleep on the couch with the TV remote tucked against his chin when Perry gets home (pleasantly buzzed, if made dour by the company he's had to endure to get there), and nothing's changed at all; nothing, save the ring on the stump of Harry's finger. Harry awakes to an empty room and thinks nothing of it, though coffee's already on once he slouches off the blanket that'd materialized around him in the night and stumbles into the kitchen. He pours himself a cup, ring clinking against ceramic when he folds his hands around the steaming mug in search of warmth. Knowing Perry, it doesn't mean a thing. It's days before he thinks to ask . \"Is this some kind of gay ritual thing?\" Harry blurts out, timing impeccable as always: it's near one in the morning, they're staked out at the far end of a parking lot, and he makes little to no effort to indicate which thing he's on about. Perry shoots him an incredulous look. \"Yes. Sitting here in the dark, freezing my fucking balls off waiting to see if this chick is a serial joyrider of antique cars is my way of sending a heartfelt overture. Client's not paying me a dime for the pleasure, but we might have dinner later. What the fuck is wrong with you?\" \"What? No, I meant— hang on, she's stealing his cars?\" \"She's taking them for walkies . I thought you were taking notes.\" Harry clears his throat, in lieu of an answer. \"I meant your ring,\" he twists it around his finger with the opposite hand, restless. It's a stupid question, he realizes the instant he's actually asked, but by then it's too late: \"Are we engaged?\" The look Perry gives him this time is inscrutable. Harry flinches, expecting a slap upside the head that never comes. \"What the hell kind of question is that?\" \"I don't know, I just thought... I don't know what I thought. You're right, it's stupid. Forget it.\" He starts to curl into his seat before catching himself, toeing off his shoes first and turning towards the window. They manage silence for all of thirty seconds. \"Do you want to be?\" When Harry turns to ask for clarification, having already lost the thread of the conversation, the confusion on Perry's face stops him cold. Perry's very rarely confused, or if he is, he doesn't show it; not like this, not to him. ... oh. Harry blinks. Shrugs. \"Do I get to keep it if I say no?\" Perry scowls at him, the sort of expression where only one corner of his mouth turns down and his eyebrows pull together, and shakes his head before returning his attention to the far end of the parking lot. \"Stop talking and you can fling it over a rainbow, for all I care.\" Folding himself back into his seat, against the window, Harry idly adjusts the ring around his finger. Silence, for all of fifteen seconds this time. \"Perry?\" \"What?\" \"What size do you wear on your ring finger?\" Perry doesn't answer, nor does he look at him, but he does reach a hand over to rest atop Harry's bare ankle. \"Chief.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Get your fucking feet off of the upholstery.\" Harry smiles to himself, pleased for reasons too vague and ridiculous to define.

You've seen those old noir movies, right? Where you can see Bogart's silhouette thru the glass? No? What are you doing sitting around staring at the computer screen then?! Get your ass to a Blockbuster and rent a Bogart movie and get some culture! And FYI, Perry's favorite is The Maltese Falcon, but you didn't hear that from me. Now that you're caught up, back to business. Harry had decided he needed a window just like that with some big black letters spelling out his current occupation. The next day he confronts Perry with the intent of charming him so much that convincing him for that window sign with be a piece of cake. Like most of Harry's ideas, this one didn't go at all according to plan. \"Come on Perry,\" Harry whined, at a scowling Perry who sat behind his big fucking desk not looking at all charmed by Harry's attempt at puppy dog eyes. \"No chief, you do not need a new fucking door with a window just so you can play at being Bogart..\" \"Ok, fine, no window, Harry agreed, but what about the sign at least Perry?

I go to so many parties, they're all the same. Full of people like me, fresh out of highschool. Well, seeing as it's the Christmas season now, we've been gone for a year or more. We aren't even teenagers any more. Though nobody other than me seems to have any intention of growing up. I don't really like the party scene. I guess I'm just a goody two-shoes, but I have no intention of getting constantly drunk or constantly high. I get a few \"Hi\"s from people, but nobody wants an actual conversation with me, because I'm not drinking much or blagging drugs from low-lives. That and the fact that the guys don't want to be seen to be too involved with me. With 'Gay Perry'. Inventive nickname, isn't it? I suppose it gets straight to the point. There's one guy though, that's making me smile a little in this godforsaken crowd. I can tell he's high (everybody is, but he's especially far gone), but he's just smiling so much, laughing and hugging everybody. Most people smile for a while, and then just get miserable. Not him. But nobody wants to talk to him either. They all get stoned, but they work as well. They did get through highschool all right, and they all have jobs. This guy though, he's the one who's addicted. Takes it too far every time. He's the guy they never want to be, no matter how nice he is to people. I recognise him, I've seen him around. Hell, we were the same class, but I can't say I know him. I keep watch on him all night, feeling strangely protective of the classmate I've never talked to. He came in with a couple of friends, but they ditched him pretty quickly. Every time I lose sight of his backcombed hair or his grin, I know where he is. He's gone to another corner to smoke something else. Eventually, the room begins to clear as everyone gets bored of this party and goes in search of another one, exactly the same but in a different place. I start to like it when it gets quiet, because the people who don't fit in that well stick around. Which means that the interesting people who don't have one track minds are left. It's just me and the guy I've been observing all night eventually. We kind of drift into conversation, and get thrown out of the house together. \"Hey!\" he says, brightly, like I'm his best friend. By this point we're walking the deserted streets of this fucked-up city together. \"Hello.\" I smile back. Nobody gets a smile off me unless I really like them. I know this. So why am I smiling at this guy who I've only just greeted? I can't deny he's good looking though; angular features, big brown eyes and thick brunette hair styled so effortlessly into endearing and teasing positions. \"I've seen you around, but I can't really say I know you,\" he says with a laugh, like he has been doing all night. \"I'm Perry Van Shrike,\" I shrug. \"And you are?\" \"Julian Wells. The notorious Julian Wells.\" His smile fades for a moment as he thinks about his reputation. He must be coming down and there's nobody left to give him anything to keep him up there. \"Wait, Perry Van Shrike? As in...um...\" I actually laugh then. It never fails to amuse me when people recognise my name, they have the realisation dawning on their face and then they get awkward about it. \"Gay Perry? Yeah, that'd be me.\" \"Don't you hate it when people stereotype? I've been watching you all night. You've been stuck on your own because of fucking stereotypes!\" He muses angrily. \"Julian is fucking high again, and it's his own fault and he's a dropout and good for nothing and he'll never change,\" he's yelling now, and I know his high has worn off. He stops without warning and turns to face me, so I almost walk into him. He stares defiantly right into my eyes with his own that are brimming with so much emotion. I can read anger, regret, fear, sorrow, hopelessness... His face is so pale his smile gone completely for how long I don't know. I see him there, lost and broken, unable to fit in anywhere, stuck in the cycle of his addiction because there's nobody to help him, then feeling awful because he wants so desperately to stop, but he's not strong enough on his own. \"Do you have anywhere to stay tonight?\" I ask him gently, not accusing or encouraging, just asking. He sets his lips in a thin line and shakes his head. \"You can come to my place if you like.\" Why the fuck am I offering this? But I feel so bad for Julian - I can see how similar he is to me. He doesn't make a big deal out of it, he nods with respect. \"Thank you,\" he says in the smallest and most dejected voice I've ever heard from anybody. It's not far to my house, but he's shivering now. Really shaking. I have to half-drag him up the stairs; he can barely stand and I hate to see it. There's so much personality and promise in Julian I can't stand to see him so wasted, so broken, so... hopeless. \"Are you all right?\" I ask him, hesitantly, when we get through the door to my apartment. Julian shakes his head and stumbles to the bathroom I point him to, voiding his stomach violently into the porcelain bowl. Fuck, I can't just leave him alone in there, but I don't know if he wants me anywhere near him. I decide I don't care, and I kneel beside him (I'm still quite a bit taller) and place a hand against his forehead, keeping his hair back. My other hand is on his back, and I feel how sweat soaked his shirt is. I slide my hand underneath it and I don't quite know why, but I'm touching his skin, rubbing soothing circles into his back. When his sickness is eventually over, I offer him a toothbrush and run a cloth under the cold tap. \"Shit Julian, you're burning up,\" I say as I press the cloth against his forehead. Julian says nothing; he's still shivering. I don't know what to do; he's sweating and his skin is so hot, but he's shivering because he feels so cold. I finally come up with some sort of plan of action. I have an arm around Julian's shoulders, and I have to practically drag him again, to bed. To my bed, because it's the only one. But at least he can stay still there, and be vaguely comfortable. \"Julian?\" I see if he isn't too far gone to be coherent. \"Yeah?\" his voice is shaking as much as he is, but at least he's talking. \"Is there anything you want?\" I don't know what he would want, but as I ask this I'm already in the kitchen pouring him a glass of water. I know as much as to keep him hydrated, or something. He smiles gratefully when I bring it to him, and it makes all this not seem so bad, somehow. It's an infectious smile, and I can't help but copy it in relief. \"I think I'd like to sleep now,\" he says, sat up against the headboard with a blanket wrapped around him. This is probably a good idea, so I nod and turn to leave the room. \"I'll sleep on my sofa, it's fine,\" I mumble, though I'll only worry if I can't watch him. I want to stay with him, to make sure he's okay...and because I just want to. But I can't, I can't take advantage of him when he's coming down badly, like this. But I stop at the door for entirely different reasons. \"Perry?\" Julian's voice is quiet, meek, barely there. \"Yeah?\" \"Stay with me...please. I don't want to be on my own, it hurts.\" My heartstrings are stretching to breaking point as I see his face. \"All right then.\" I want to say so much more, but I'm trying to keep myself a little distant. I sit on the side of my bed, and place my hand on his shoulder as he lies down. \"You'll feel better in the morning,\" I murmur to him, reassuring myself really. Julian says nothing, but a hand, smaller than mine, snakes out of the bedsheets and rests on mine. I don't know how much more I can stand before I do something I'll regret. I feel Julian pulling my hand, trying to pull me down. I give in, and he shuffles up, me lying beside him now, both of us under my duvet. I take a few moments to pull my jeans off, and kick them onto the floor, but honestly, it's only because they're too uncomfortable to sleep in. \"Thank you,\" Julian mumbles, and still the only contact is our hands. I close my eyes and I try to sleep, but with Julian still shaking a little right next to me, it's very difficult. I give up and sigh, the man in the bed next to me starting at the sound and movement, before relaxing again. He shuffles back again, so he's even closer to me, and I can feel the vibrations his heartbeat makes through the mattress. Too fast. \"I don't know what's happening, Perry,\" Julian whimpers, \"It's never been as bad as this before, and I'm scared.\" He sounds so lost, and all I can think to do is to give in to everything, and pull him close to me. He tenses at first, but then he curls up against me, shivering and sweating, but it's slowing, calming, especially when I press soft, unobtrusive kisses to his face. \"You'll be all right.\" I whisper it into his ear and I know I'm not lying. We'll be all right. ","Summary":" I'm at another party. I go to so many parties, they're all the same.

It's just a headache!\" \"Oh yeah? What about your breathing? Sometimes I can hear you from the next room! You don't fucking have asthma! And what about yesterday? When you fainted and I couldn't wake you up for ten minutes!\" You really scared me . It was left unspoken, but Harry could hear it. Maybe that was why he gave in and let Perry drive him to the doctor. Who referred him to the hospital. It was in the six hours he was there that he remembered why he hated hospitals. Bad things happened in hospitals. People died. Dialling Perry's number with shaking fingers, Harry ran on autopilot, asking Perry to come and pick him up, sitting silent in the car, sinking onto the sofa, staring straight ahead, nothing in his head but a thousand What ifs Perry said nothing, didn't attempt to make conversation. He just had no idea of what Harry was thinking about, only being able to tell that something was wrong. He sat beside Harry on the sofa, with a hand bracingly on his back, avoiding getting too close for comfort. He could feel the smaller man trembling from just the small contact he gave. Perry's heart shattered in his chest and he managed to ask Harry. \"What did the doctor say?\" \"The...I've been having headaches and I'm sh-short of breath because...they're waiting for test results but...fuck Perry...\" tears brightened the usually-perky Harry's eyes. \"They think...they think there's a t-tumour on my l-lungs...it's...it's,\" he broke off, unable to say the word. \"they d-don't think there's much they c-can do but they say they n-need to see me again to m-make sure.\" Harry was shaking violently now, tears spilling from his eyes. Perry could not help but pull Harry against his chest and hold him as he sobbed. He'd seen Harry cry before, but it had never been like this. Had never been tears of utter hopelessness and despair and the knowledge that everything was fucked up and it wasn't fair and there wasn't a damn thing anybody could do. Harry's words were only just sinking into Perry, bringing a lump to his throat that made breathing difficult. To think that Harry, his forbidden, pretty little Harry, the source of amusement and annoyance, the sunshine in his dull existence could be and would be snatched from him. It twisted his stomach and made him want to throw up. As it stood, he rubbed Harry's back in soothing circles, murmuring to him all the things he wished he'd been able to say sooner. \"It's all right sweetheart. We'll be okay.\" He didn't know when he'd fallen for Harry, but he knew it had been a long time ago. He'd just been to afraid of rejection to do anything. He regretted it already, but he would be only what Harry wanted him to be and nothing more. \"P-perry?\" a small voice eventually stammered against the detective's shoulder. \"There's something else.\" the blonde immediately feared the worst, but said nothing so Harry could continue. \"I've been too scared to say anything for months but...I...I don't think I'm as straight as I make out...and...and it's you I want Perry. Fuck Perry, I...I love you.\" \"Jesus Harry. I love you too. God, I love you so much.\" Harry pulled away a little, so Perry could see his tear-stained face. They kissed, then, for the first time, the first time it meant something, Harry still crying, tears mixing on their faces as they both surrendered. For two weeks, they were happy. The best two weeks of both Perry and Harry's life, ignoring the weight on Harry's shoulders as Harry let Perry love him, as they woke up together, as endearments and petnames where whispered, as promises were broken and new ones made. As every day they confessed their love like it was the first time. They were happy until Perry woke up alone. They were happy until he found Harry sitting at the kitchen table, face pale, staring at a letter with an official stamp on it. \"Open it for me Perry.\" His voice was barely there, and Perry really didn't want to know what the letter said, but would not refuse Harry. \"Dear Mr Lockhart,\" he read aloud. \"We have received the results of the tests we ran, and regret to inform you that assumptions of a cancerous tumour were correct. We would very much like you to come in on the Sixteenth of September to discuss all possible options.\" Perry stopped reading then, nothing else being important anyway. \"Oh sweetheart...\" he said, using his favourite petname for reassurance as Harry stood up, tentatively stepping towards Perry. The blonde pulled the darker haired man close again, stroking his hair and kissing the side of his face. \"Perry...\" Harry whispered. \"Get out while you can.\" \"Harold Lockhart, you're fucking crazy if you think I'm leaving you. No. I'm your boyfriend and I'm going to fucking face this with you.\" The next few days dragged. They were both counting down the days to the hospital visit, and eventually it was upon them. Harry held on to Perry's offered hand all the way there, and Perry chanced to put his arm around Harry's already-skinny shoulders while they waited. Eventually, Harry was called into an office. Perry went with him and they both sat down. The doctor smiled the way you would to a small child. \"Hello again Mr Lockhart. Perhaps your...\" \"Boyfriend. Whatever you tell me, he hears too.\" Harry snapped, defiantly. \"Very well then,\" she was clearly taken aback, but recovered quickly. \"We need to discuss what we're going to do. Mr Lockhart, your tumour is cancerous and extremely aggressive. We can attempt to remove a large part, if not all of it quite safely. Chemotherapy may...give us more time. Ultimately, Harold, you have...six months. Eight if you're lucky. If we begin immediately.\" Harry's whole world came crashing down around him. He felt a gaping hole where his heart used to be. All the plans he'd had; to get married, to go on holiday with Perry, to finish college...they were all crumbling to dust. So little time. \"Mr Lockhart,\" he was brought back to his senses. \"If you and Mr...\" \"Van Shrike. Perry Van Shrike.\" \"If you and Mr Van Shrike will accompany me downstairs we can begin your treatment.\" Harry blindly obeyed, supported by Perry who gripped his arm. He let the doctor do what she wanted to him, Perry not letting go of his hand, then driving him home in his state of numbness. Harry vaguely registered Perry putting him to bed, but his whole day had passed in a blur. It was only as he drifted into a fitful sleep that he realised the true implications of what the doctor had said. It was very probable he'd never even see thirty-five. His stomach twisted suddenly, a side effect of the chemotherapy and Harry staggered to the bathroom, hunching over the toilet bowl and being horribly, violently sick. Perry rubbed his back and held his hair away from his forehead, clearly as shaken as Harry was by the reaction. Nevertheless, the older man ran a bath, guiding a shaking Harry into it gently, and running a sponge over wherever he could reach, kissing wherever he cleaned. The smaller man was grateful, and slept some when they went back to bed. Weeks slipped by, Harry going to the hospital every other day to get his medicine, Perry by his side every second of it. Neither of them mentioned what was going on as it happened. By night, Harry threw up. By day, Harry was listless but ever-smiling, lying on the sofa mostly, venturing outside for walks along the beach with Perry, something they should have been able to do much more often. Perry came close to breaking down in front of Harry when he thought of what Harry would be like, were he not so weak. They'd have a frisbee and somebody else's dog, no doubt, and Harry would be losing a fight to get the frisbee back, ending up covered in sand, and complaining about where it had gotten. What if... Harry soldiered on, and Perry respected him for it. He dearly wished though, that the harry who complained of paper cuts would be given back to him. The younger man cried again only once, falling apart in Perry's arms as he caught sight of his skeletal frame in the mirror. The chemotherapy had destroyed his appetite and made him lose weight far too quickly. Thank god his lustrous hair had remained intact. \"How can you love me?\" Harry had sobbed. \"I'm hideous! It's so fucking unfair! What did I do to deserve this Perry? What?\" He'd never put much thought into the way he looked, but his appearance had shocked him. Perry truthfully reassured him. \"Harry, I love you no matter what. You're still beautiful. Your face is still the pretty face of Harold Lockhart.\" But for how much longer? Perry knew the fight was being lost when blood pooled in the toilet bowl. Sometime during the endless chain of hospital visits, gaunt nurses and cancer treatment, Christmas came around. Harry stayed cheerful and attempted to sing carols in the hospital ward (not being particularly in tune). He apologised that he hadn't got anything for Perry, but whispered in his ear as they sat curled together on the sofa at home, that perhaps tonight he wasn't too tired to have fun. It was the most precious gift he could have given. Perry made love to him for the first time in months, both of them needing every touch. In turn, Perry presented Harry with a box, a plain silver ring in it. \"When this is over Lockhart,\" he grinned, emotion not feigned, \"When this is over, we're getting married.\" Harry only kissed him, neither of them speaking what was in the air between them. Harry saw in the new year laughing, falling asleep just after the countdown. Perry savoured every smile, every flicker of the Harry he knew. Halfway through January, Harry didn't wake up until almost evening. Three days after that, he collapsed in the kitchen, Perry only hearing the thud and seeing his unconscious lover on the floor. Harry was taken to hospital again, Perry holding his hand even if he couldn't feel it, talking to Harry even if he couldn't hear it. \"C'mon sweetheart, we've been through worse than this before. You're going to wake up, you hear?\" Harry did wake up, in time to see his sister and his niece, smiling at them, spirits still not dampened, laughing with Chloe until his family left. Perry was alone in the room with Harry then. Neither of them said anything, but Perry had Harry in his arms, cradling him against his chest before kissing him desperately, urgently, as if he could take all of Harry's pain away. Someone was sobbing as they kissed, and Harry's tears were silent, his fingers gentle on the blonde's face. It was him, then. \"Thank you Perry. For all you've done for me.\" Words could not reproduce Harry's emotion but he had to try. \"I love you, you know that. I love you so much.\" He held up his hand where a silver band glimmered. \"I'll wear this, forever.\" he whispered. \"But I'm so tired Perry. I'm so tired.\" And Perry Van Shrike could do nothing, but cling to his lover's hand as if it was a life ring, watching his eyes close, watching him sleep for an hour, letting his tears fall, unchecked and then... And then. Slowly, slowly, Harry's breathing became less noticeable. Until it wasn't there at all. ","Summary":" \"Harry, you're going to the doctor.\" \"I'm not Perry, I'm fine .

Perry had had enough then. He marched in front of Harry, turning the TV off and facing him. \"That vase. Was the only thing I got when my mother died. I wasn't old enough for money and my dad fucking took the lot. It might be JUST a bit of glass to you, but I am fucking sick of you having no respect for property, at all. My mother gave me it, which is why it was in my office where you couldn't get it! No respect for property and no respect for MY house either! MY house that I let you stay in!\" \"All right, I'm sorry!\" \"Well sure, you say that NOW, but what about next time? And the time after? You aren't even sorry anyway! You don't mean it!\" \"It's just a bit of glass.\" That was it. Perry was yelling now. \"I am so fucking SICK of everything about you, Harry Lockhart! You moan, you break things, you have no respect for my property, you mess up on all the work I give you - and if it was anyone else you'd be fired by now - you say that you're a failure, and yeah. I'd have to agree. You fail at being a decent boyfriend, you just...you're a homophobic gay man! You barely let me touch you because you're scared! All of that Harry, all of that I could deal with. But the worst thing, the absolute bottom, is the fact that you don't LISTEN to me. I try to help you, god knows I do, and you don't even give me the courtesy of LISTENING!\" Harry had sat in shocked silence, hearing Perry's rant. True, maybe he'd bust some stuff he shouldn't and gone against what Perry had told him- \"I can't deal with your shit Harry. I won't. Get the fuck out of my house.\" Perry stated it quietly, dangerously. What Harry felt at that moment was a lot like what he'd felt when he'd been punched in the stomach. His defence against the hurt was anger, and he was the most mellow person in LA. \"Yeah? You think you're so smart, you self righteous bastard! I wouldn't stay here another minute! All the presents you got me? The clothes? I threw that shit out!\" \"Whatever.\" Harry stormed upstairs after that, Perry following him, unrelenting. \"You're a failure Harry. A complete fucking joke.\" The dark haired man felt tears burn behind his eyes as he shoved anything and everything he found in his drawers in suitcases and bags. \"You're a failure and a pathetic fucking joke of a man. Look at you! You're fucking crying!\" Harry bit his lip as Perry taunted him. \"You know what Perry? You're a nasty piece of work. You're not nice to clients who need you, you're not nice to anyone you're in a fucking RELATIONSHIP with. You're a bully, Perry Van Shrike. Nothing but a no-good, piece of shit COWARD!\" He snapped, shoving the last of his jeans in a suitcase and wrenching the zip closed. \"Fuck you, Lockhart!\" Harry was halfway to the door. He turned back, kicked on his sneakers and yelled. \"Fuck you RIGHT back!\" He slammed the door behind him, not trying to clear the haze of anger pounding his brain until he was alone in the only shitty hotel room he could afford. That shirt looked too big for him. That wasn't his shirt. Harry sat on the bed, staring at the item in his hands, tears still burning, overflowing this time. \"Fuck you Perry Van Shrike,\" he said, the words catching in his throat. \"Fuck, I'm so sorry. I am a failure and I shouldn't have pissed you off so much. I should've done what you said...Oh Perry.\" Harry eventually got some sleep, waking up in the early hours of the morning, tearstained and heartbroken. How could Perry do this to him? He should have given him a decent chance! He should have talked it out first. Harry blindly pressed numbers on his phone, calling the only person who might understand. Harmony sounded surprised when she answered. \"Harry?\" \"He's left me.\" \"What?\" \"Perry. He broke up with me.\" The words had an awful finality to them. \"Oh, Harry...I'm so sorry babe.\" Babe. Perry called him that when he was in a good mood. Used to call him that. He cried again, on the phone, calling Perry all sorts of names to Harmony, blaming that 'fat asshole' for making him hurt so bad, (Bad is an adjective, fuckhead, it's badly), making him hurt so badly. Harmony told him he had to go talk to Perry, because Perry had called her earlier and said the same things. Apparently, he'd cried, too. The same things that meant nothing. Were empty threats that were trying to make everything somehow easier to deal with. It was easier to deal with a break up if you hated whoever sent you away. If you didn't still love them. It was a fortnight though, before Harry plucked up the nerve to call Perry. The older man didn't answer, no matter how many times Harry called him. And Harry made a point not to do it too often. He'd failed so many times before, but he became determined to prove that he could make this work. Now he stood on their doorstep in the rain, knocking gently on the door, half hoping Perry didn't hear. The door opened though, and there stood the tall, handsome blonde Harold Lockhart had fallen for. The one he'd been aching to see for a month. \"I'm sorry Perry. I'm sorry, I tried so hard not to fuck up, I really did. I tried hard to hate you, but I can't. I love you damn it, I love you, I fucking love you, you asshole.\" The tears were there again , but Harry didn't even try to stop them. Perry looked shocked for a moment before he pulled Harry into an embrace, so secure and familiar, fingers running through dark hair. \"It's all right Harry. It's all right. I love you too babe.\" ","Summary":" \"Harry?\" \"Huh?\" the dark haired man barely looked up from the TV when Perry tried to get his at"},{"Movie":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang","Title":"I've Seen Sexier Handshakes!","Author":"Rat-chan","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6397802","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer : Do not own (characters, etc), do not make money.

He wouldn't be like an edgy teenager watching an R-rated movie with the folks. \"Colin 'Caterpillar Brows' Farrel?\" Perry snorted. \"You're joking, right?\" \"I thought he was han—supposed to be handsome?\" \"Harry, you also thought 'having apposable thumbs' meant someone was really good at thumb wars.\" Ah, that tone of Perry's… It was such a refreshing bucket of ice water. \"What's wrong with him? Is this about your old crush on Don Johnson and pink shirts and the murder of another innocent TV classic?\" \" God , don't remind me.\" Perry's shudder shook the entire sofa. \"No. This is about at least three other, far more objectionable things. One, Dabney had him go blond for this. It was bad enough in Alexander , where the costumes might distract one, at least, but this…\" There was another shudder. \"Two, I believe I've already mentioned the eyebrows.\" This time, Perry raised his hands to dramatically (meaning in a very gay kind of way) emphasize his shudder. \"And three, he has no chemistry with this actress. It's like watching salmon spawn.\" Harry looked back at the TV screen, laughing at the image. \"Come on, Perry. National Pornographic aside-\" \"Geographic, idiot.\" \"I know that, asshole. I was trying to make a joke.\" \"Well, you didn't try hard enough, Chief.\" \" Anyway …\" Harry refocused on the flesh onscreen, train of thought momentarily derailed by admiration of the actress's excellent… skills. \"It's not that bad.\" \"Honestly, I'd rather see you-\" Perry cut himself off with an odd, choking little cough. \"Yul Brynner in this scene.\" \"Didn't know you liked bald guys…\" \"I don't ! That's the point, moron.\" He paused to take a deep, exasperated breath. \"I've seen handshakes that are sexier than this so-called love scene.\" \"Handshakes?\" Harry sputtered, turning away from the television and back to his companion. \"Now I know you're exaggerating.\" \"Am I?\" Perry smirked, a light of amusement that had been absent for most of their little movie screening filling his eyes. \"I can prove it, you know?\" \"You can try.\" \"On your feet, Chief,\" Perry stood up and moved a few feet from the sofa as he said it. \"You should know by now that I always put my money where my mouth is.\" \"I didn't think you ran that kind of business, Perry.\" \" Ugh . That barely makes sense, dickhead. Now get your ass off that couch and get over here.\" \"Fine,\" Harry half-groaned, although he could feel the smile pulling up the corners of his mouth and eyes. He pushed himself up off the sofa and moved to stand in front of his boss. \"Well?\" \"Pretend this is our first meeting.\" \"Okay…\" \"Oh, hello there.\" Perry's tone went from jagged icicles to smooth, rich honey. He regarded Harry, a small, inviting smile curving his full lips. \"I don't believe we've met before.\" \"I'm Harry Lockhart,\" the former thief replied, holding his hand out. \" Harry Lockhart ,\" the P.I. repeated slowly, his warm voice purring over the syllables. \"A pleasure .\" After the last consonant, his lower lip curled in to meet his tongue in a tiny, glistening kiss. \"May I call you Harry?\" He asked as he finally reached out to take the offered hand. His fingers ghosted across the sensitive skin on the inside of Harry's wrist, more an impression of heat than of touch, before clasping firmly around the smaller man's hand. Harry found himself capable only of nodding and vaguely returning the pressure of Perry's hand as it slowly pumped his own. \"I'm Perry Van Shrike.\" Perry gently pulled Harry's hand toward himself, turning it slightly so that the back faced up more. His intense, heated gaze filled Harry's vision as the P.I. leaned forward. He was so close that Harry could almost feel the breath of his next words whisper across the strangely hot skin of his cheeks. \"Please, call me Perry.\" With those final, silken words, Perry's thumb caressed the back of Harry's hand and his finger curled in the palm before slowly, lovingly sliding along trembling fingers to their tips and away. His partner's gaze was drawn to the motion of that withdrawing hand as Perry brought it up to trace the smile still bowing his generous mouth. Harry found himself unconsciously leaning in toward that soft hand and sultry grin, his hand reaching out farther to seek out lost warmth. Until Perry's hand dropped and the curve of his lips became the smug one that his assistant was far more used to. \"You see?\" he asked triumphantly. \"You-\" Harry's hand dropped. \"You!\" He began to furiously rub alternating sides of his hand against the leg of his jeans, trying to wipe away the lingering warmth that infuriatingly refused to dissipate. He couldn't do anything about the heat in his face. \"You cheated !\" \"I beg your pardon?\" Perry tried to look affronted, but even Harry couldn't be fooled. Not when the man was still smirking. \"You said a handshake . That was way more than just a 'how d'ya do' and shake hands!\" \"Hey, all part of the ritual.\" He actually had the gall to wink at Harry. \"Now, I do believe that dreadful scene is over, so we can get back to that piece of drivel I'm ashamed to say was made by a friend.\" He moved back to the sofa and sat down again, his entire frame radiating smug satisfaction. \"That… that was only just barely sexi— hotter than that scene.\" Harry muttered as he returned to the extreme opposite end of the sofa. \"And you still cheated.\" He kept his eyes locked on the television and the violent fight scene currently filling its screen. \"Whatever you say, Chief.\" The self-satisfaction still rang clear and obvious in his voice. \"I'll make it up to you, though.\" \"You'd better.\" \"I'll do it again tomorrow.\" \"Excell… eh?\" \" What just happened here? \" the actor on screen asked, confused. Harry knew he was confused because… well… because . ","Summary":" Disclaimer : Do not own (characters, etc), do not make money.

It was lucky he didn't crash. He wanted to. Why was it that he had to be such a fucking idiot all the time? He constantly wound Perry up, and when the P.I finally snapped, Harry got angry. It was bullshit. If he had learned how to control his temper, how to just leave Perry alone, he wouldn't be here now. He wouldn't be driving to the hospital to say his good byes to his boyfriend. When they had rang him, Harry refused to believe it. Perry wouldn't crash his car. He would pay attention to the road, always careful. Unless he was distracted. Distracted by shouted insults and screamed words designed to hurt. Harry hadn't meant it, not really. He was going to apologise when Perry got back from his drive, when they'd both cooled down. Now it was too late. The hospital corridors passed in a blur, the nurse talking to Harry did not register in his mind. He vaguely heard her saying that he was who Perry had asked for, but was it possible that he might have family numbers. He had shaken his head. He was being ushered then into a side room and a tall, lanky doctor with slick brown hair was explaining that it might be time to say good bye. The crash had shredded his liver, his stomach, his spleen. Everything was damaged, it was too dangerous to operate. Harry didn't care. He just wanted to see Perry; see with his own eyes that he was still alive, still breathing, that he wasn't too late. The sight that met his eyes when he was finally allowed into Perry's room was not nearly as horrific as the images his mind had conjured up. The majority of the P.I's body was covered by the sheets of his bed, and what skin that did show was marred only be artificial cuts and scrapes. Harry paid no attention to anything else as hurried straight to his boyfriend's side, hands fluttering awkwardly when they could find no where to hold that didn't look damaged. \"Perry. Fuck, Perry. I'm so sorry. I don't hate you. Can you hear me?\" Perry's eyes were closed, but at the sound of the familiar voice they fluttered, opening just enough to let him see the figure kneeling beside him. \"I know, Harry.\" His voice was barely there, Harry had to strain to catch it. \"I love you.\" \"No. No, Perry. Don't say that like its good bye. You'll live, you've got to. You got shot through the fucking heart and survived; you can live through a car crash.\" His words were cut short by the continuous whine of the heart monitor. Tears fell but he made no move to wipe them away. Why wouldn't Perry listen to him? He refused to let him die. Not like this, not when it was his fault. Not when he had never had the chance to tell him that he loved him, too.

No, no, mmph!-\" A strong arm wrapped around his neck, a forceful hand on his cheek. Yet soft lips met his own in a passionate kiss. At first Harry thought Perry was completely serious about this spur-of-the-moment kiss. But out of the corner of his eye, Harry noticed a cop car pull up next to the alley. He began to play along with Perry's scheme, petting his hair, entangling fingers in the blonde hair. Perry kept a firm arm around Harry's shoulder, his right hand gripping Harry's cheek. It relaxed a little as the kiss deepened, caressing the cheek bone below wide chocolate brown eyes. Harry was having a fit in his head. Sure, what else was there to do to cover something as bad as two guys putting a body in the trunk of a car? But did Perry have to get into all the details of – TONGUE. Harry's mind drew a blank when he felt Perry lick at his teeth, asking for entrance into his mouth. He was opening his mouth to protest, but Perry was sneaky, and his tongue slid in like a snake in the sand. Harry placed a hand on his side, trying to push him off yet make it look like he wanted more (the cops were still watching them – would they ever leave?). Perry was relentless in his mouth. Harry hated to admit it, but fuck; Perry was awesome at making out. He even managed to lure Harry's tongue into exploring his partner's mouth, entangling together in blissful harmony. Harry closed his eyes, putting his brain on pause and enjoying the sensation of another person against him. The hand on Perry's hip stopped pushing him away, and was instead digging into his jacket, pulling him closer. Harry's other hand moved from his side into Perry's hair again, interlacing slim fingers into short, blonde locks. The arm that was around Harry's shoulder came back, cupping his face, forcing the kiss to deepen. It was sort of euphoric for Harry – no girl had ever even come close to kissing him like that. But soon his thoughts came rushing back when the light dissipated from the two of them. Yet, the kisses kept coming. One of Harry's eyes opened, watching the cop car roll out of his line of sight, yet Perry kept assaulting his mouth. The hands cupped on his face clung a little tighter, begging a little harder. And in all honesty, Harry didn't mind. His body relaxed in Perry's, letting him press his body against the car. Harry suddenly felt a pang in his lower gut, heat rising in his face. His brain turned back on, telling him to get this fucker off him, but he couldn't. Seriously, he physically could not get Perry off of him. Besides, Harry's body was telling him otherwise. Perry's mouth suddenly left his, kissing along his jaw line and up to his earlobe, hot breath surrounding the light tongue laps all the way. Harry couldn't help but buck a little into Perry, it felt fucking amazing! Perry reacted to this by nibbling on the arch of Harry's ear, breathing heavy heat though his teeth. Harry's breath hitched a little as he squirmed underneath the larger man. He bucked again, this time feeling Perry's growing erection against his own. Harry lolled his head to the side, closing his eyes, allowing Perry to gain better access to his neck and ear. Perry gladly took the invitation, licking small circles below Harry's earlobe, nipping a bit at the stubble. Harry took in another shaky breath as Perry violated his personal space. He felt Perry lean in more, grinding against his much more noticeable erection, and purr in Harry's ear seductively. \" Somebody wanna fill me in? Hmm?\" A feminine voice from nowhere scared Harry shitless, Perry attempting to stay cool and rising off of Harry in one swift motion. Harry was frozen against the car in shock and fear, hoping the voice wouldn't notice his hard-on. He then saw Harmony step from the shadows into the street light's glow, her face curled with disappointment. Harry looked a little like a kicked puppy, avoiding eye contact at all costs. He attempted to tell her what was going on, but nothing really coherent came out of his mouth, words failing to form on his tongue. \" What's going on? Why are you and Perry knacking on each other?\" ","Summary":" More transfers from my dA. Anyhoo, a simple KKBB one-shot, featuring Harry on Perry action.

I really hope I did the characters justice and I look forward to any insight or suggestions. This thing seriously tricked me into writing it. It started off all innocent, just a brief character study while I fought through some writer's block for another story of mine, and then it took on a life of it's own. This isn't my usual writing style, but again, the story seriously took over. Please enjoy! P.S. I really hate when FF dot net destroys any hope of a page break I try to come up with. Grr... At 22, Perry wasn't much different than he is now. A little less cynical, a little less snarky, a little more impulsive (what young man wasn't?) but he was still essentially the same person. He joined the military fresh from high school, impatient to put as much distance between him and his father. One term in the military was definitely enough for him and he sure as hell didn't plan on doing it again. He was eager to get out and get on with his life. This is how he ended up meeting Vincent Merot, a young, idealistic grad student who attended school at UCLA. They started out as roommates and then became friends, and eventually romantic partners. They never discussed their relationship and therein lay part of the problem. Perry didn't talk about feelings or emotions or anything sappy like that. It didn't come naturally and he never saw reason to force it. So it was at least partly his fault. They'd been roommates for about two years, lovers for a year when it happened. He walked in on Vince with one of his classmates… and he lost it. The military had taught him plenty of tricks and by the time Perry was done swinging, the man was barely recognizable. Vince went off on him, called him 'sick,' and a 'monster.' Perry dumped him and kicked him out of the apartment. Hours later, Vince was dead. Suicide. The police determined that there were other factors involved beyond just getting dumped. He wasn't doing well in school, his financial aid had been cut off, his car was getting repossessed, his grandmother had just passed, and after all, he'd always suffered from severe depression. It didn't stop the guilt from tearing into him. Nothing did. Perry took one lesson from that relationship and made a promise to himself. He doesn't get attached. He doesn't get so invested that he loses his cool. He doesn't ever fall in love. Love is dangerous. . . . . Perry hated watching the unfolding drama of Harry and Harmony, two people who could have been soul mates, if not for the fact that they were both so fucked up. He already knew how the story would play out. Harmony had grown up with little sense of control and had adapted to life accordingly by using her body, her sexuality as a bargaining chip, as a tool to get what she wanted. Perry liked Harmony, knew she was a good person but despite the love that she had for Harry, she wouldn't be able to change. People couldn't just tear down their defenses on command and Harmony would never be able to give herself fully to Harry, and Harry kind-hearted fool that he was, wouldn't be able to bear witnessing Harmony use and debase herself. And Harry… Harry was the sort of person who seemed to wake up every day completely lacking any knowledge of the world. Every morning held fresh starts, anything was possible and anything that happened had a silver lining. There was a doe-eyed innocence about him, some semblance of naiveté that never ceased to amaze Perry. Everything that had happened to Harry, everything that he'd seen, and still he expected to witness the best of everything and the good in everyone. Sometimes Perry wanted to shake him, beat the innocence out of him. Do anything to make him realize the world was full of sick, depraved people who would just hurt him for the hell of it. And when those instances hit him, all he could picture was his father. His father yelling at him to toughen up, to be strong, and god why did he have to be such a little bitch? And Perry hated himself for it. And he knew that if he did manage to take away Harry's innocence, he would take away what was Harry. And so every day, Harry would witness Harmony's trespasses, her lies, and he would be hurt, confused and angry, but he would forgive her anyway, still expecting that \"perfect\" Harmony. And every day saw Harmony grow more and more distant, unable to cope with Harry's expectations, unable to be his perfect Harmony. And every day Perry watched Harry's heartbreak, watched Harmony's growing bitterness and resentment, until finally… they ended. . . . . But Perry had already seen this show and so he spent six hours babysitting a grown man, (one who'd somehow become his best friend) as he drank himself into a stupor. And it was Perry who busted down Harry's door when he stopped answering the phone the next day. It was Perry who found Harry in the midst of swallowing a lethal amount of pills and dragging a knife along his wrist. And it was Perry who held Harry until the ambulance arrived. He didn't call Harmony, knew that Harry wouldn't want her to know, knew telling would only cause her guilt she didn't need. So he stayed by Harry's side, held his hand and pretended he'd never been here before. When Harry woke hours later, eyes red-rimmed, full of grief, anguish, and shame, Perry put aside his pride, stroked his hand and told him it was okay and let Harry sob into his chest, apologizing, desperate and Perry hated him for it, wanted him to be stronger, to be selfish, to live for himself and not every jackass who just wanted to exploit him. At one point, (he's not sure when, but there must have been some point when he made a conscious decision) Perry decides he would never try and force Harry to change, would never try to change him, but he would be there to protect him. He would be there when Harry trusted the wrong person, when he picked a fight with someone (anyone), when he got in over his head and when he loved the wrong person. Perry would be there to protect him, no matter what. He didn't want Harry to change. And so when Harry, with a little bit of hope in his eyes, mentions that Harmony wanted him to move out, Perry invites him to stay and when Harry starts calling him a big soft teddy-bear, Perry snarks right back, because he isn't going to be changing either. . . . . Harry waits outside the hospital, leaning against a stranger's car which he fails to notice is worth $300,000 and Perry struggles not to reprimand him. He's still recovering, after all. They ride in silence back to the house, something Perry isn't used to. The quiet gets to him and he tries to stir up conversation but Harry doesn't take the bait, even when Perry mentions a (nonexistent) case he wants Harry to work on. He's silent until they park and Perry goes to unbuckle himself and then Harry turns, eyes wide, manic, \"Aren't you going to fucking say it? Just say it already!\" Perry stares, racking his brain, struggling to catch his meaning but comes up empty and says as gently as his personality allows, \"Say what Harry?\" \"I told you so! That you were right and I should've left her alone!\" \"No Harry.\" Perry feels his face tighten, reaches a hand to brush Harry's hair, \"Let's go inside, okay?\" he wants to call Harry an idiot, wants to smack him upside the head, wants to pull him into his arms and protect him from the world (and Harmony). But they both just go inside. He makes them hot chocolate like his mother used to, adds a splash of whiskey like his dad used to, and when he hands the mug to Harry, he takes it without expression. Perry figures it's finally time and he sets his own mug down and faces Harry, using his hands to turn Harry to face him. He leaves them there, (not) enjoying the sensation of Harry's soft skin, scruffy five 'o'clock shadow beneath his fingers. They make eye contact and he says simply, \"Don't do that again, alright?\" Harry breaks down again and they fall asleep together on the sofa and Perry hates himself for the dreams he has that night. He wakes, having to hide the evidence before Harry sees, and he feels like a disgusting pervert. . . . . Two weeks later it's almost back to normal. Perry doesn't pull his punches or bite his tongue, at least not all the time and Harry's beginning to jump around and chatter incessantly again and he finally asks about the 'case,' and then pesters and badgers him until Perry sends him on an easy assignment; snapping pictures of an unfaithful wife. He doesn't realize his mistake until Harry returns via taxi at four in the morning, reeking of alcohol and dropping packets of gum as he stumbles into the house. Harry shoves the camera into Perry's chest, eyes flashing anger, guilt and fear before they descend back into misery. Perry stops him with a hand on the shoulder and when Harry gives him the coldest look Perry's ever seen on that face, he drops his hand and lets him continue without a word. Perry feels like the biggest jackass in the world. The next morning (afternoon) Perry brings Harry some of his favorite coffee and a bottle of aspirin. The other man winces at the sunlight streaming through the window, and his eyes look like Harry's again. Perry struggles to find the words he needs to apologize and finally gives up and pats Harry's head and leaves the room. After all, life goes on. . . . . Sometimes Harry will fall asleep when they're watching a movie together. A lot of the time Perry only notices when the room goes suddenly still and quiet. Harry's gotten better about talking during movies (which is to say, he only talks during action scenes) but he still blabbers on constantly. On the nights Harry falls asleep, Perry always covers him with a quilt and shuts the TV off before he goes to bed. Neither of them ever mentions it, and it gets easier for Perry to do every time. One night they're watching one of Harry's favorite movies, some cheesy flick from the 90's that looks like it was made in the 80's. Perry hasn't bothered to follow the insane film (does that guy seriously have a chainsaw for a hand?) and might have left to go to bed, or do something productive, but Harry insisted he stay. Harry falls asleep about ten minutes before the credits start rolling. Perry lays the blanket over his sleeping friend and then, inexplicably, sits on the coffee table, elbows propped on his knees. He's been watching Harry sleep for at least three minutes before he realizes what he's doing. Disgusted and disturbed, he rubs his face with one hand. He goes to stand and glances at Harry one last time, and freezes. Harry's watching him through sleepy, curious eyes. Perry wants to hurl out an insult or a snarky comment but his tongue sticks in his mouth and the best he can do is retreat, feeling Harry's eyes on his back. . . . . A couple weeks later, Perry wakes up to find an extravagant bouquet of roses on his desk. Harry's sitting across the room at his desk, so Perry is already on high alert. Harry is never up before him. The ex-thief is alternating between staring too hard at his computer and watching Perry with the biggest shit-eating grin he's ever seen. Upon seeing the flowers, Perry halts midstride. He glances at Harry who is suddenly so engrossed with his paperwork, he's stopped breathing. Suspicious, Perry walks slowly around his desk, wondering if this is some kind of \"thank you\" gift from one of his clients, or a bomb, which is probably more likely. Very few of his clients are happy when they receive definitive proof that their spouses are cheating. Finally, he nears the desk and hesitantly examines the flowers. He doesn't find a bomb, or anthrax, or even a note. He glances over at Harry who's watching him. \"You've got a secret admirer.\" He says somewhat breathlessly. Perry feels a peculiar warmth in his face. He slides into his chair and shoves the flowers into the garbage without a word. Harry looks crestfallen, but says nothing. Perry struggles to understand the motivation behind the flowers, wonders what kind of crappy prank Harry had been trying to pull. It doesn't occur to him until later that evening that maybe Harry was trying to be romantic. The thought terrifies him. . . . . The next morning, he finds a bouquet of violets. They follow the roses into the garbage can. The day after that, its lilies. And then, gardenias, followed by daffodils. Then, tulips. It goes on for almost two weeks before Perry takes pity on Harry, and his wallet. He takes the day's bouquet (carnations) and put them into a vase and sets them on his desk. He doesn't have to look to know that Harry's glowing and grinning ear to ear, but he does anyway, when he's sure that Harry isn't looking. Something (happiness?) warms his chest at the look of pure unadulterated joy on his friend's face. He does his best not to think about what it means, for either of them. . . . . Perry starts having a recurring nightmare. He's walking into his apartment, except it's the one he had when he was 22. There's something wrong and his gun is in his hand as he does a sweep of the apartment. He comes to his bedroom and someone's there. It's so dark, he can't see. They're moving… are they going for a weapon? He raises the gun, aims and fires. The person turns. It's Vince staring at him as blood blossoms on his t-shirt. Perry rushes to catch him. Then suddenly, it isn't Vince, its Harry. And then they're lying in the middle of a street; the street where they both almost died, and Harry is trying to tell him something and Perry's leaning close to hear, but the words are lost to the wind. The first time he dreams it, he awakes with a gasp, Harry's name on his lips and that's when he realizes how precarious their situation is. He had accepted that he was lusting after Harry; that was relatively easy, if unpleasant, to accept. The man had a certain appeal, an enigmatic quality; even if he was nothing like what Perry normally went for. But lust went away and if he had to, he could find an outlet. No problem. Harder, and far more terrifying, to accept was the fact that he might feel something more than that for his friend. And the hardest thing to accept was the possibility that Harry thought he had feelings for Perry. But Perry had made a promise and he would keep it, even if it meant protecting Harry from him. . . . . After he accepts the flowers something changes, and Perry doesn't know whether to be worried or grateful. Harry's really smiling and laughing again. Sometimes he catches Harry watching him, inscrutable, and when Perry barks at him to get back to work, he just grins to himself. It begins to drive Perry crazy. It feels like Harry knows something he doesn't and that's not something Perry's used to. But they're able to get on like normal, at least for a while. One night, Perry's watching one of Dabney's newest actors in a corny crime drama, hoping to get fresh ammo for when they next meet and he almost doesn't hear Harry come through the front door. And then he's there, blocking the TV with that inscrutable look and a bottle of cheap, crappy wine. \"Would you move already?\" he snaps, growing uncomfortable with the way Harry keeps staring, and he tries to ignore the twisting in his gut. Finally, Harry moves but only to sit next to him, far too close. \"Goddammit, what Harry?\" he snaps again and Harry almost grins, but he hesitates before he speaks. \"Would you like to, uh, have a glass of wine with me?\" he holds up two champagne glasses. Slightly disconcerted, Perry snags the bottle and glances at it. \"No. Jesus, could you buy a shittier wine?\" he snarks and hands it back. Harry looks momentarily dejected but recovers and opens his mouth to speak but Perry stops him, \"Shut it. Commercial's over.\" Perry turns to the TV and tries desperately to ignore the fact that Harry's still staring at him, and he feels almost guilty when the other man leaves the room. Half an hour later, Harry returns reeking of wine as he snaps off the TV, and Perry's pretty sure the bottle's empty now. \"Harry what the-\" Perry's words are cut off by the press of lips against his own and he tastes cigarettes, cheap wine, and something oh-so- Harry. As Perry's tongue acts of its own accord and begins to fight/dance with Harry's, he realizes what's happening. Perry tears away and they break apart, both gasping. Perry feels a familiar, dangerous sensation at the sight of Harry, flushed, eyes slightly glazed, and lips puffy, ready for more. He clutches the cloth of his sweats to keep his hands from latching onto Harry like they want to. Harry comes forward and Perry leaps back. \"No, Harry!\" he shouts, probably louder than necessary, and confusion and hurt flit across that beautiful, stupid face and Perry puts on his most scornful voice, \"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" Harry hesitates, confusion so apparent. \"I kinda thought that was obvious.\" \"No. Go to bed. I'm not playing part in this little experiment of yours just because Harmony dumped you.\" He snarls and it almost hurts him to say it and his voice cracks a little, but Harry doesn't notice, only hears the words and his face crumbles. Harry stands there, silent, and then suddenly, he's gone and Perry wants to go after him. Instead, he collapses under the guilt of his words and wishes that Harry had left some of that wine. . . . . Harry doesn't get home until three in the morning (and no, Perry wasn't waiting up for him). There's something in his walk, something in his eyes, that sets Perry on edge. He goes to Harry's side, trying to see it, to understand. And then- a smell wafts over, hits him like a freight train. The obscene stench of sweat and sex intermingled with a man's cologne. There's a look of guilt and fear in Harry's eyes as Perry approaches. He feels a sudden urge to attack someone, he just doesn't know who. A sense of betrayal and possessiveness rise up, a feeling of 'mine' erupts in his chest and he fights it down. Then suddenly, Harry's in his face, attempting bravery. \"There. Experiment over.\" He says daringly. Perry's fists clench and he reacts without thinking, shoves Harry down the hall, into the bathroom, wrestles him into the shower and turns the water on, ignoring all of Harry's protests and yowls as the cold water hits him. \"Clean your ass off.\" He grits through clenched teeth, \"And don't ever come back to this house smelling like a goddamned whore again.\" Perry hates himself and the hate only grows when Harry lowers his eyes, accepts his punishment in silence, and begins to disrobe. The once-cool detective leaves the bathroom, slams the door shut, and nearly sprints to his bedroom where he locks the door behind him. Desire, want and need are all battling with common sense and reason. He will NOT sleep with Harry. He will NOT sleep with Harry! He refuses to take the most genuine person in his life and destroy him. He will not ruin this friendship just because his dick wants a playmate. He hears the shower turn off, and seconds later, footfalls outside his room. He prays with all his might that Harry just keeps going and his prayers are answered and Perry almost weeps in relief, knowing he would not have been able to deny Harry again. . . . . The next morning neither says a word about the previous night and they both continue life as 'normal.' . . . . Perry doesn't realize that Harry's been talking to Harmony until almost a month after that, when she accosts him outside his favorite coffee shop. \"What the hell Perry?\" Mixed feelings arise in him and he chooses the safest; annoyance, \"Can I help you with something?\" \"Yeah, you can stop being such a little bitch and fucking go out with Harry already.\" He feels his eye twitching and doesn't deign to respond as he brushes by her. \"Perry!\" She heads after him and he hears her mumble 'drama queen' and then she jumps in front of him. He almost spills his coffee on his $500 suit and glares at her. \"He loves you, Perry.\" \"Or, maybe, he's transferring all his feelings for you onto the closest thing he has to a friend in this stupid city.\" He grits out between clenched teeth, jaw popping. \"He's over me, Per.\" Her voice hints at something bitter, it enrages him and his hand crumples the coffee cup, spilling hot coffee over his hand. He curses and throws the cup to the ground. He tries to step by her but she blocks him. \"Move.\" \"He loves you.\" She repeats and his stomach clenches and he struggles to keep the pain from his voice when he speaks. \"Yeah, well, I'll keep that in mind.\" \"I know you love him.\" She says, arms crossed, glaring. He's not sure whether he doesn't respond immediately because it doesn't deserve an answer, or if he can't because his throat constricts. \"News flash, Princess, he's my friend.\" \"Seriously, why won't you fucking admit it?\" \"Because I'm not going to risk my friendship with him just to satisfy some petty desire. I'm not like you.\" He says it to hurt her and it does, but it doesn't stop her. \"You are such a jackass.\" She pauses, \"So what is it, Perry? You afraid of getting hurt? Or are you afraid of hurting him?\" He walks away without a response and she lets him go. All the while something whispers in the back of his mind, \"Both.\" His hand is red and throbbing from the hot coffee and he ducks into the next coffee shop to run his hand under cool water and get a fresh cup. He avoids the office for the rest of the day but texts Harry some inane task to keep him busy. . . . . The next time he sees Harry the inscrutable look is back. Perry scowls to himself and remembers when life was so much more simple. . . . . Again Harry doesn't mention anything and life continues per usual, but now Perry knows better than to relax. A week later, Perry comes to the office after a takeout run and finds a note on his desk. Harry's taken a case. At first it just annoys him, but something about it goes deeper than that (more than just Harry taking a case without his permission). It's only after he's called Harry five times with no answer and stared at the note for several minutes that it finally hits him. The address is that of a gang member's, a man he'd been following for his cop friend. There's no way his contact would've asked Harry to tail anyone, let alone a known gang member. He calls his friend just to be sure and only after his contact assures him that he did not send Harry, an unlicensed citizen, to trail anyone, does panic set in. Perry got made and now Harry was walking into a trap. He's out the door and in his car in a flash, still calling Harry's cellphone repeatedly. Curses fly from his mouth as his car flies through the L.A. streets. He draws on his extensive knowledge of the city, careening down back alleys, hurtling up side streets and he's there in record time. Miraculously, without getting pulled over (not that he would've stopped). Harry's car is parked down the street from the house, which sits facing a vacant lot. He parks behind Harry's rust bucket and climbs out, gun in hand. He glances into the car. It's empty. A half-eaten burger lies on the driver's seat and Harry's cell phone is blinking in the cup holder. Fear isn't something he's felt in a long time. Not the paralyzing blind panic that he's feeling now, and for a moment he can only stand there frozen as useless adrenaline races through his veins. A car door slams a few streets over and it's enough to spring him into action. He jogs toward the house, eyeing the windows. All of them are covered. He doesn't see any movement. He makes it to the porch without hearing gunshots and he thinks it might be a good sign. Gently, he checks the front door, finds it unlocked, and he eases it open, back pressed to the wall. He waits, listens for movement or voices, hears nothing, sees nothing. He wipes his sweaty palms on his slacks and tries to ignore the pounding in his chest. When he decides its safe he pushes the door open. No sudden shouts or noises greet him and so he peers inside. The front entry and living room are empty. He sees stairs off to the left, and a hall which leads to several doors. He's heading toward the stairs when he hears a thump and veers to head down the hall, listening for more. But the universe has decided to make this difficult, and all is quiet again. He tries not to think about how bad a sign that is. Harry should be cussing and yelling. He should be screaming for Perry to come and save him. The gun is slick in his hands and he has to pause and wipe them again before he starts checking the doors. The first is a closet. The next is a bathroom. And then he hears another thump, the low murmur of someone talking. He bypasses the next door, heads to the end of the hall and presses his ear to the closed door. Definite movement. He tries to decide the best way to enter and then he recognizes a low gasp, a muttered epithet and he's no longer thinking when he kicks the door open, gun raised. His eyes sweep the scene. They take in the gang member and one of his buddies; both holding guns. Harry is tied up, curled in a corner, bleeding… bleeding everywhere and barely conscious. One gang member turns, raises his gun, and Perry doesn't bother warning them. He shoots the first, swings to the second and shoots him before he can react. Perry knows how to shoot. They're both dead before they hit the ground. He knows that there will be legal repercussions (there always are) but doesn't care. He waits, listens, in case there are more in the house and all is quiet. He holsters the gun and runs to Harry's side as he pulls out his cell phone and calls for an ambulance. His friend looks up, confused, as Perry starts to untie him with shaky hands, \"Perry? Aw shit, Perry. Was a set-up. 'M, sorry.\" He's mumbling and blood spews from his mouth when he talks. Perry can barely understand him. \"Don't move Harry. The ambulance is on its way.\" Perry tries to assess his injuries but there's too much blood and he gives up and just holds him while they wait. Harry's breathing is shallow, weak and obstructed by blood. There's something gut-wrenchingly familiar about this scene but he doesn't exactly understand what until Harry starts to say something and he has to lean down to hear him. His heart stops as the nightmare floods back to him, and for a moment he's somewhere between fantasy and reality, both of them nightmares, and he's not sure which is which. And then Harry's whisper reaches his ear and he plants himself back in the here and now and he hears, \"So, been trying to tell ya… 'm kinda gay for you.\" Perry stifles a frantic, desperate sort of laugh and is saved from having to say anything by the EMTs entering the house and he yells out their location. He squeezes Harry's hand and Harry gives him an almost-smile and tries to squeeze back, but his fingers barely move. One of the EMTs edges Perry out of the way and he watches, listening to their words, trying to infer how bad it is by their tones. But it all seems like gibberish. One of them glances at the gang members and Perry's afraid that they're going to stop working on Harry to examine them, but they only call for another unit. They get Harry onto a stretcher and he has to follow them in this car. Perry calls his police contact and tells him what happened, and he promises to meet Perry at the hospital and send some uniforms to take care of the scene. Gratitude almost overwhelms him and he hangs up just before he gets to the hospital. They take him into the ER away from Perry and no one tells him anything. . . . . He waits for three hours before a doctor comes out and tells him Harry is stable and has been moved to another floor. His police contact has already come and gone, after Perry promised to call him when Harry's well enough to tell his story. Harmony is with him now. There was a brief moment where he almost didn't call her, where his petty, angry side said she didn't deserve to know. And then he realized that Harry had forgiven her, had gotten over it, and therefore, so should he. Harmony asks a few questions when she gets there and her accusatory eyes are watching him. She wants someone to blame for this, he knows that, and he almost wants her to say something, to give him a reason to be a dick and bitch at her. She keeps silent though and he has no way to relieve the tension that's building in him. When a nurse finally comes to tell them that Harry's awake and able to take visitors, he almost turns and leaves. But he fights the urge, knowing Harry would want to see him. He lets Harmony go first and she comes out too soon, way before he's ready. \"Hey, you be nice to him.\" Harmony says as she's walking by. \"Shouldn't be too hard to be nicer than you were.\" He says briskly and doesn't wait for a response. He could've sworn there was a time that he actually liked her, he just can't seem to remember it now. Harry's sitting up when he enters and a vague, pleasant smile indicates that they've got him on some powerful painkillers that are working just fine. He nears the bed, hesitates, almost reaches for Harry's hand, pats it instead. \"So, you doing okay?\" \"I can't believe it.\" Harry says and Perry meets his eyes, \"I almost fucking die and you still can't say it.\" \"Say what?\" \"Whatever, fuck it.\" Harry waves his hand impatiently and flings of the sheet covering him. He tries to climb off the bed, snags his foot and falls head first to the ground. Perry catches him with a muttered 'idiot,' and sets him right. Harry takes a moment and then sinks to his knees and gazes up at him with a ridiculously solemn expression. Perry glances toward the door, the impulse to run away almost too strong to ignore and Harry reaches out and latches onto his hand as if he knows. \"Perry Van Shrike. I love you. And not like, in a friend way, or a business partner way, like if business partners actually loved each other-\" \"-Harry-\" \"-but whatever. I'll get my gay membership card or whatever it is you have to do-\" \"-Harry-\" \"-Will I have to go out and buy like, new clothes or-?\" \"Goddammit Harry!\" Perry pulls him up by the flimsy hospital gown and presses a firm hand over his mouth. He waits a minute, not even sure what he wants to say. Finally, he releases Harry, ignoring the uncertainty in those wide, brown eyes, \"Who says I even like you?\" He snarls, but Harry doesn't miss a beat, one of his eyebrows scrunching up in disbelief. \"Really? Says the guy who was watching me while I slept? You know that was pretty freaking creepy right? Not to mention the whole call my name out in your sleep thing.\" Perry flinches at that and Harry looks at him, triumphant. Perry switches tactics. \"You don't know what you're getting into.\" \"Uh, I just spent my day getting my ass kicked by two douchebags with guns, I think I do.\" \"No, Harry.\" Perry shakes his head, \"I mean me. I've already told you, I'm not a nice man.\" Harry shifts beside him, scratches his head. \"Hate to break it t'ya, but you're one of the nicest people I know. I mean, you're kind of a dick, but when it, you know, comes down to the important stuff, you're there for people.\" Perry finally risks a glance over and Harry's just watching him, expression serious and Perry can't think of anything to say as his imagination runs wild with what he can do to that mouth. And then their lips are pressed together and he can't even tell who started it. \"So,\" Harry says gasping as they pull apart, \"were you like ignoring all of my wooing or what?\" \"Woo-what the hell are you talking about?\" \"The flowers, the wine, all that shit. I mean, I fuckin hate wine! What did you think I was doing?\" \"Being a dumbass.\" Perry says. They're both silent for a second and then Harry speaks, frowning. \"So, do I have to go to like city hall and get a card or what?\" \"Idiot.\" And even he can hear the affection in his tone. Harry just smiles broadly and Perry pulls him into another kiss. He's not going to say that this is a smart move to make, but damn if he'd feel like an idiot not to. And maybe, just maybe, love isn't as dangerous as he thought. Hope you enjoyed! :) ","Summary":" So this is my first KKBB fic.

I know where the story is going and will continue it when I get over my likely temporary enthusiasm for other fandoms. \"Hey, Perry! Get out your wallet, man, 'cause you owe me five bucks!\" Harry called out to his boss and housemate. Perry looked up from his copy of GQ with an expression of long-suffering patience. \"What are you on about?\" \"Remember way back when we first met and I told you about that girl from high school – Harmony – and then you went off into your gay little daydream about Bobby Mills?\" \"I can remember that, but I can't find a point anywhere in what you just said.\" \"Well, d'you remember I bet you five bucks that you could still get him?\" \"Yes, and as I recall, the conversation degraded into some idiocy about a talking monkey.\" \"That's not the point. The point is you owe me five bucks.\" Perry just glared at Harry. \"Come with me,\" Harry said as he pulled a grumbling Perry with him to the desktop computer. \"Look,\" he said, pushing the other man down into the chair. \"What am I supposed to see apart from your appalling English?\" \"Not that!\" Harry said as he minimized his email client and clicked a tab on the browser. \"I looked up Bobby Mills on Classmates dot com – I got the name of your high school off your yearbook – and this is what I found.\" Perry looked at an internet profile with a photo of a rather robust looking woman in a tight pink dress. \"Wait… She looks kind of familiar…\" Then, he read the name at the top of the page. \"Bobbi Mills!\" Further speech failed him and his mouth merely opened and closed a few times. \"Looks like he got himself some fine boobs, too.\" Harry indicated the cleavage visible above the neckline of the dress. \"And read there,\" he added, pointing to a section of the profile labeled \"likes.\" He began reading in falsetto, \"'I love big, strong men. I'm into men with guns. I enjoy long walks on the bea—'\" \"STOP!\" Perry looked almost as if his head would explode. Harry was smiling like mad. \"Told ya you could still get him.\" Muttering something about \"failure\" and \"gaydar,\" Perry handed his assistant five dollars. \"By the way, whatever happened to that talking monkey?\" A loud groan and the sound of a head hitting a keyboard were the only answers he got. I've never used the website in question, so I'm kinda just assuming there is some place on the profile for users to comment freely about themselves.

Yeah, so disclaimer = I don't own, I get nothing. On with it, then. Day 1: A New Roommate \"Harmony, what the hell is this?\" Perry held up the blue and white house-shaped box. The words Build-a-Bear were printed on its sides. \"It your birthday present, Perry,\" Harmony said, smiling like mad. She stood up and swayed her way from the sofa, where she had been snuggled close to Harry, over to Perry's chair. They had had jello shots instead of cake -- Harmony's idea -- and they were all more than a bit unsteady. \"Now hurry the fuck up and open it.\" Sighing dramatically, he opened the box and pulled out... \"I reiterate: what the hell is this?\" he asked again in a clipped tone. \"And you, Chuckles the Clown, stop laughing,\" he said, turning to Harry, who was giggling. \"This is not funny.\" \"Of course it's not funny ,\" Harmony replied. She put her hand to her mouth and laughed a bit herself. \"It's you .\" \"It's who?\" \"Perry Bear. The teddy bear version of you.\" Perry moved his eyes back to the ofensive object in question, which he held in his thumbs and index fingers only, as if it might soil his hands. \"Actually, Harmony, I think the bear is less gay,\" Harry managed in a break between drunken giggles. \"Shut up, fuckhead.\" He threw a pissy glare at his assistant, who quieted, and then refocused on the teddy bear. The bear was dressed in a suit and shiny black shoes. On the bear's fuzzy brown head was a blond wig. The wig was pulled back in a ponytail and trimmed short. In the bear's hand was a little toy gun. \"I couldn't get the goatee, but otherwise, it's pretty good, isn't it?\" \"It's obscene .\" Perry dropped it back in the box with a shudder. Harmony laughed all the harder at this, not at all offended at her gift's reception. Perry suspected that he had reacted according to her plan. Bitch has a wicked sense of humor , Perry thought with irritated affection. He turned back to Harry, who had picked up \"Perry Bear\" and was currently putting him in various \"gay\" poses. \"Hey, fluff for brains.\" Harry shifted the bear's eyes to look at Perry. \"Not the bear, you. Where's my present?\" \"You don't pay me enough for that.\" Glare. \"But I got you a card.\" He handed Perry a thick neon green envelope. As Perry opened it with trepidation, he noted the mark of a trendy custom stationary store. Fearing what he would find, he pulled the card out. There was no picture on the front, it just read, \"I went all the way to the future for your present. And here it is --\" Perry opened the card. Before he could even register the image of the ugliest monkey he had ever seen, the word \"FICUS\" chimed loudly from the card. \"I don't get it,\" Harmony said. But Perry, smiling in spite of himself, exchanged a look with Harry. \"OK, I'll take the card,\" Perry said. Harry moved Perry Bear's arms up in a hurray gesture. \"But that is on probation.\" Harry moved the bear into a sad pose. \"Put it down , Harry.\" Obediently, Harry placed the toy on the table next to the sofa. Harmony, falling for his feigned dejection, moved back to him hugged his head, stroking his hair. Harry smiled stupidly and turned his face into her breasts. Perry rolled his eyes. \"OK, kids. As much fun as this is, it's bedtime. We have work tomorrow.\" Harry, still blissfully nestled in his girlfriend's bosom, merely hummed a response. \"Harmony, are you staying?\" \"Naw.\" Harry pouted. \"Sorry, but I've got an audition tomorrow.\" Perry released the breath he had not noticed himself holding. \"Then, I'll call you a cab.\" He hoped that his tone was not as bright as it sounded in his own ears. \"Thanks,\" she replied, and then proceeded to make her farewell to Harry. Perry turned away and called the taxi company. Their reply was blessedly swift. \"Goodnight, Harry,\" Harmony said, giving him one last peck on the lips. \"Goodnight, Perry. Happy Birthday, again!\" \"Goodnight, Harmony,\" both men answered. The door closed and Harry spent a few moments staring at it wistfully. \"Harry. Bed. Now.\" Wordlessly, the smaller man complied. Perry turned off the living room lights and then made his way to his own bed, leaving Perry Bear temporarily forgotten on the end table. Day 2: A Hard Day's Night \"Harmony called,\" Harry told his boss after hanging up his phone. \"She thinks she nailed the audition. We're gonna celebrate. Wanna come?\" \"I think I'll pass.\" It had been a long, boring day of office work. The kind of day that kept Harry's mouth moving and Perry's patience wilting. \"Two consecutive nights drinking with you? Unlike you, I'm not a masochist.\" \"A what?\" \"Nevermind, idiot. Pass on my congratulations to Harmony.\" \"Will do,\" the former thief replied as he picked up his wallet and keys. \"Don't wait up for me.\" A long-suffering expression was the only reply Perry deigned to give. \"Here,\" Harry commented as he approached the armchair where the larger man was lounging. \"Perry Bear can keep you company,\" he said gleefully as he handed the plush toy to Perry. \"Get lost, shitwit,\" he replied, tossing the bear onto the sofa. Harry chuckled all the way out the door. -about 4 hours later- Perry woke from the doze he had fallen into after dinner. He had only meant to rest on his bed for a moment before watching the evening news. He looked at his watch. 1:30. May as well check if Harry had come home. Then, he would get properly ready for bed. He glanced through the open door to Harry's room on his way to the bathroom. No one was there. He headed downstairs, but paused before he reached his destination, noticing a large lump on the sofa. So, Harry was home. There he was, fast asleep on the sofa. He was curled up on his left side, facing the coffee table. His mouth was parted slightly and the softest of snores came out. And-- Perry rubbed his eyes, making sure no sleep continued to cloud them. No, they were not playing tricks on him. There, tucked firmly in his assistant's arms, was Perry Bear. Despite himself, Perry's habitual scowl -- the one he kept on his face around Harry -- dissolved. He was glad there was no one around and no mirror at hand at that moment. It was no doubt the single gayest expression he had ever had on his face. Quietly, Perry slid his hand into his pocket and pulled out his cell phone. He activated the camera, pointed, and clicked. The sound of the digital shutter caused Harry to stir, but he simply groaned a little and pulled Perry Bear closer to his face. Perry must have been more tired than he thought, because he found himself suddenly sitting on the floor next to the sofa, his knees unable to hold him. He looked at his phone, confirming that the picture had come out all right. It had, so he saved it. Then, he went back to looking at the real thing. Perhaps getting ready for bed could wait. Day 3: A Gift of Gratitude \"Perry,\" Harmony's bright voice came over the phone, \"what is this?\" \"It's just a little something to say thank you and congratulations.\" \"But, Perry, this is a bottle of Patron! What did I do that was so wonderful?\" \"I'll tell you another time. And don't worry. It was a gift from a grateful client. I just thought I'd pass it on to someone who'd enjoy it more.\" \"Well thank you very much!\" \"You're welcome. Have a nice day.\" Perry heard the slightly puzzled sounding reply as he severed the connection. Well, he did sound unaccountably cheerful, even to himself. He even whistled as he slipped the phone into its usual pocket. \"Now, time to get back to work,\" he said to the stuffed bear that currently occupied a place of honor on the sofa.

Please understand, this is the last thing I'd like to do. Well, other than kill you of course.\" The fox hugged his mother and started crying silently. \"I'm gonna miss you. Just please take care of them. Give them good homes to stay healthy in.\" The mother nodded and pulled her child away, running off in tears. A flash of light happened and a female baby fox was seen being dropped off at a shelter. \"I'm sorry my daughter. Your older brothers must be seperated from you for the prophecy to work;\" The mother explained. \"Of course, you'll be a bit of a brat when they find you, but it's understandable since you're the youngest.\" The mother tears up. \"But seriously. It breaks my heart to let go of you after three days. I promise, you and your brothers will be safe.\" The mother kisses her daughter on the forehead and then knocks on the door. The mother runs off in tears, not wanting to face this path. \"And now, we see the middle child of the group, and watch how he grows up;\" The narrator announced, and then a fox kit was shown. \"This is...the chosen one.\" The screen faded to black and the title screen said Unlikely friends Part one. Scene cuts to the mother carrying her only remaining child that she has to give a good home to in her mouth as she runs through the forest. The forest was shown in a dark and depressing mood, showing how sad this is for the mother and her children. The mother ran past a hunting field as she avoided all of the hunters, making them just barely miss her. The mother ran up to a fence, setting her child down. \"Son. You need to listen to me;\" The mother said, and her child looked at her. \"What?\" The child asked. \"I know this is hard to handle, especially since you're only two and you age in human years;\" The mother said, informing the viewers of how the animals age. \"This breaks my heart as much as it does yours, so please. Stay strong.\" The son got a glimpse of what his mother is saying, holding back his tears to not look dumb. The son felt sadness in his heart at the thought of being all alone. The son hugged her mother, who wrap[ed her arms around her, both of them devastated. \"Goodbye;\" The mother said, heartbroken, and then said her child's name. \"Tod.\" The mother ran back into the forest, only for her to be shot in the head. The mother fell to the floor with her head bleeding on the ground. A shadow swiped at the mother, dragging her off. Tod was seen watching from afar, wanting to know what happened. \"Mom?\" Tod asked in desperation. \"Where are you mom? Why did I hear that gunshot?\" Tod suddenly gets an idea of what happened and lies down, gaining a sad and somewhat broken expression. A young boy was seen looking out the window, feeling sad for the fox. The boy ran outside and walked over to the fox. \"Hey.\" Tod looks at the boy, who holds out his hand. \"You alright?\" Tod walked over to the boy slowly, allowing him to pick him up. \"It's alright little dude. I won't hurt you.\" The boy investigated Tod, thinking they could have some fun. Tod looked to see a tail on the boy, taking a liking to his features. \"Hey, you have a tail too.\" \"And I can understand you;\" The boy said, and then walked back inside with Tod. \"Of course, I have hands and you have paws. In this universe though, It's pretty easy for animals to do human like things, if they feel like it.\" The boy set Tod down on the couch and the two looked at each other, finding passion in how they can live together. \"My names Jake;\" The boy said, revealing his name. \"I don't know where my parents are, but they vanished a long time ago. I know they weren't careless though.\" Tod nodded, understanding Jake rather well. \"My names Tod. My mom had to abandon me and my siblings for some prophecy thing.\" \"Well I'm sure she means well;\" Jake said with hope. \"Until then, you can live with me.\" Tod smileed and hugged Jake with joy, glad to now live with the human fox hybrid. Five years later. Scene cuts to Tod looking outside, looking rather excited Tod jumped off of his bed and runs out of his room, rather optomistic for what the day has for him. Tod ran downstairs and into the kitchen, where Jake was cooking breakfast. \"Hi Jake;\" Tod said, and then ran over to Jake as he jumped onto the table and jumped up and down, acting like a rather bubbly child. \"It's finally time, isn't it? I can finally go out on my own!\" \"Yep, it's exciting alright;\" Jake said, tossing Tod a pancake, which he catches in his mouth and eats, then wiping his face with his paw. Tod turned to the screen, seeming to be breaking the fourth wall. \"After the incident with my mom and my siblings five years ago, I've been living with Jake. He didn't even bother to put up adoption papers, as he wanted to take care of me himself. I can't really blame him though, as he could've wasted money.\" Tod falls back into one of the dining room chairs, still talking to the audience. \"I got hooked to some of the things he likes like video games and outside stuff, and now I can finally go out on my own. Of course, I have to wear this wrist watch he gave me, as it protects me outside and it's kind of embarrasing, but I know he means well. And I love him.\" \"Tod?\" Jake was seen looking at Tod, looking rather confused. \"Who're you talking to?\" \"Just the people who're reading the story;\" Tod said.\" I wanted to do a loud house kind of thing, where I talk to the audience like Lincoln.\" Jake shrugged and walked back to the sink, and then Tod ran over to the door. \"Can I go outside now? Can I, Can I, Can I? Please?\" Jake rolled his eyes while smiling, liking Tod's excitement. \"Go ahead Tod. Just don't go too far.\" \"Yeah!\" Tod ran outside the door and ran off into the meadow, loving the area. Tod looked over the area for a few seconds, letting the air soak in. Tod breathed in the fresh air and then runs off to play. Scene cuts to a grown wolfhound and a bloodhound pup drinking from their water bowls The bloodhound suddenly got a scent and started sniffing, getting the attention of the wolfhound. \"Whatya sniffin there Copper? \"I've got a trail of something;\" Copper said, and then the wolfhound started sniffing too. The wolfhound got a scent as well, but it was a different one, making him laugh a bit. \"Now that's easy. Amos is just cookin up gritters and fatback, now you know that.\" Copper nodded his head no. \"Uh uh. That's not what I'm smellin Chief.\" Copper started to walk off, giving Chief caution. \"Now where the heck are you off to?\" \"I'm gonna find out where that scent is coming from. I'll be back soon;\" Copper assured Chief, wanting to find the scent he picked up. And if Amos asks, just tell him my butt had a pinecone.\" Chief rolled his eyes at Copper's words, and went back to sleep. \"Young wippersnappers, always curious to everything. Scene cuts to Tod chasing a butterfly in the forest Tod chased the butterfly a bit more and then saw Copper, hoping to gain a new friend. Tod walked over to Copper, who's still sniffing, and hopped onto a log. Tod goes over to the log's hole and looked in, seeing Copper's nose pop out and then go back down once Tod sat down, and then Tod turned to the screen. \"That's ONE way to find food.\" Tod walked over to the end of the log and looked inside. \"Whatya smelling?\" Copper looked at Tod. \"I'm on a trail.\" Tod became curious to what Copper's looking for. \"A trail for what?\" \"I don't know yet;\" Copper said, and then he continued sniffing, stopping when his nose went to Tod. \"Why it's, it's you.\" Copper let out a badly pitched howl as Tod jumped down, wanting to ask what Copper was howling for. \"Whatya do that for?\" \"We're supposed to do that when we find what we've been tracking.\" \"Oh, so you're a hunting dog in training;\" Tod said, and then he snickered. \"Well I sure home I'M not one of your catches.\" Copper laughed a bit at Tod's joke. \"My name's Tod. I'm a fox. What's your name dude?\" \"My name's Copper;\" Copper said. \"I'm a hound dog.\" Tod and Copper looked at each other with smiled, finding a deep hidden friendship from within. And no, they're not gay. \"You'd be really good at hide and seek, ya know?\" Tod said, liking Copper's sniffing ability. \"Ya think so?\" Copper asked. \"I don't see why not. You wanna play for a bit?\" Tod asked, just as excited as Copper to have a new friend. \"What'd you have in mind?\" Copper asked, and then Tod shrugged and walked off, with Copper following. Tod and Copper continued to walk through the forest, hoping to find something to do. \"There are lots of things we can do actually. Climb trees, Find a lost pyramid of egypt in paris, lots of stuff.\" \"Um...Are you sure that's safe? I don't know if I'd be up for that;\" Copper said, showing his timid side. \"I don't know. But I'd be more than up for it;\" Tod said, revealing his brave side as he ran off, allowing Copper to chase him. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper playing tag in the forest Tod and Copper continued to run through the forest and then ran up to a pond. Tod and Copper looked at the pond and then at each other with a nod. Tod and Copper jumped into the pond, splashing each other playfully. \"Good thing we're naturally born swimmers;\" Tod said in a joyful tone. \"No kidding;\" Copper nodded in agreement. \"I'm not ready to drown.\" Tod noticed a pink glowing light and swam over to it with Copper right behind him. Tod and Copper walked up to a bush just as a grown adult's voice was heard. \"Copper!\" Copper flinched at the sound of his name being called by his owner. \"Sorry Tod. I gotta go. Amos doesn't like it when I'm gone for too long.\" \"That's fine. We can check out the glow tomorrow;\" Tod said, allowing Copper to head off. \"Don't forget!\" \"I won't!\" Copper assured his new fox friend, who looked at the bush again. Tod looked into the bush, dying to know what was in it, but kept his distance so he and Copper could see it together. Tod walked off, looking at his wrist watch. \"Good thing this puppy's waterproof.\" Tod headed home for lunch and then the bush glowed once again Scene cuts to Copper tied up to his barrel, sighing in a rather sad mood Tod was seen walking up to Copper, puzzled as to why he didn't meet him by the bush like they planned, but not mad at all. \"Hey Copper. What happened? I've waited for at least two hours.\" Tod noticed that Copper's tied to his barrel. \"Golly. You're all tied up.\" \"Yeah, and it's no fun either;\" Copper whined, but in a soft and low tone. \"My master says I gotta stay here today. Now I know how the slaves feel.\" Tod tried to think of a way to free Copper and then takes out a claw. Tod tried to cut the rope, making Copper worried. \"You sure this'll work?\" Copper asked. \"What if Chief wakes up?\" \"Who?\" Tod asked in a curious tone, and Copper pointed to his barrel. Tod walked over to Chief, who was sleeping. \"You mean this old timer?\" Copper nodded, and then became cautious when Tod started to walk in. \"Gee willikers. He sure is big.\" \"That's not the part you gotta worry about;\" Copper whispered. Tod crawled up to Chief's mouth and lifted his lips up, finding his teeth to be rather sharp. \"And look at the size of these teeth. These could kill a bear.\" \"That's the part you gotta worry about;\" Copper whispered, fearing for Tod's life. \"Oh quit you're worrying Copper. As long as he doesn't wake up, I'll be fine;\" Tod said, sounding rather sassy and cocky, and then he noticed Chief mumbling and leaned over to his ear, whispering something to him. \"Dude. You're chasing a badger.\" \"Badger;\" Chief mumbled, making Tod laugh silently as Copper looked in and snickered. \"Alright, that's pretty funny;\" Copper admitted, staying on task of worrying for Tod. \"But seriously. Get out of there.\" \"Oh fine;\" Tod said in a snarky tone, only for Chief to pin him against the wall with his nose. \"No. It's NOT a badger;\" Chief said, confused as to what he smells. \"It's a...smells like a fox\" Tod was seen laughing silently at chief sniffing him, finding it to be rather ticklish. \"It tickles Copper.\" Copper backed up and covers his eyes with his paws, not wanting to see Tod get murdered. Chief woke up and saw Tod, giving him a blank and serious stare. \"Can I help you?\" \"Um...Well...You see...\" Tod struggled to find the proper words to say, giving Copper a panic attack and making him breathe heavily. Chief sighed in pity, knowing he wouldn't feel right hurting a fox kit. \"Alright kid, now be on your way.\" Chief lets Tod walk out of his barrel, looking out of it as Tod walks off slowly. \"And don't let me catch you sneaking in here again.\" \"Right. Got ya. No problemo;\" Tod said, and then Chief went back to sleep, as Tod nudged Copper. Copper took his paws off of his eyes to find Tod pointing to the rope. Copper looks to see the rope cut, smiling with loads of joy. Tod and Copper high five and then look at Chief, glad to see him still sleeping. Tod and Copper run off, wanting to see what's behind the bush. Scene cuts to a vixen fox kit, or however you describe vixen kids, lying down on the couch in a bored and frustrated mood \"Ugh. How come the only shows on weekends are kids cartoons?\" The vixen complained, and then her owner came by. A young grown male who wore a tuxedo and a tophat. \"Something wrong Terra?\" \"Just the fact that the cartoons on weekends are all stupid;\" Terra complained. \"Nothing all that serious.\" \"Well alright then. Now I have to go to work, so I hired a babysitter for you.\" Terra groaned and sat up, looking at her owner. \"Terry, please. I don't need someone to look after me. I'm strong enough on my own.\" \"You keep telling yourself that;\" Terry said, knowing that his five year old fox couldn't survive on her own. \"Just please enjoy this one. Or at least try to.\" Terra rolled her eyes and sighed, knowing she couldn't win. \"If it makes you leave faster.\" \"Oh, you don't mean that;\" Terry said in a playful tone. \"Anyway, I've gotta go now. Stay safe, and the babysitter will be here in twenty minutes.\" Terry exited the house and Terra got up, running off to the garage. Terra looked around and then saw her soccer ball. Terra ran over to the soccer ball and picked it up, getting an excited look for what she was planning. \"Just enough time to practice for soccer tryouts.\" Scene cuts to a young male fox kid running down the streets, seeming to be in a good mood The fox arrived at a music show and acted like he was playing guitar for a bit and then runs off. The fox kid tightened his backpack a bit and the continued running. The fox kid arrived at his house and walked inside, happily greeted by his owner, who was a calm young woman in a meditation outfit. \"Home on time again Tyler. How do you do it?\" \"It's like you always say Lila;\" Tyler said, as he pulled a paper out of his pack and handed it to Lila. \"Stay calm and you can get through it.\" Lila looked at what iwas shown to be a graded test, which has an A+ on it. \"Aced it again. You're like a genius.\" \"A genius doesn't call themselves a genius Lila;\" Tyler pointed out, and then walked over to the fridge and got a soda. \"Of course, I can't be ALL smart kid. Everyone has a side to them that goes against the usual nerd routine.\" \"That's true. And you shouldn't try to hide it;\" Lila said, sounding rather inspring as she made Tyler smile, and then he walked into the room. Tyler turned the tv on and then began studying as Lila walked in. \"Studying with the tv on? That's so original that I'm honestly impressed.\" \"I do it sometimes when you're at your yoga classes;\" Tyler said, showing that he does this often. \"I can do two things at once.\" \"Who can't?\" Lilla said, as she walked upstairs to leave Tyler to his studying. Tyler thought about his future, finding it to be rather bright. \"Twelve years and not a single bad report. Let's keep that up Ty.\" Tyler continued to study and watch tv all at once. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper walking through the forest to find out what was in the bush \"So tell me Copper;\" Tod asked his friend, curious to know something. \"Why do some dogs want to be hunters?\" \"I don't know;\" Copper admitted. \"I've always thought about it, and I don't know why either. I'm not exactly brave, so I don't think I'd be up for it.\" \"Don't be stupid Copper;\" Tod said in a supportive tone. \"Jake told me that as long as you believe in yourself, you can strive to be anything. He's my owner in case you're wondering.\" Copper thought about Tod's words for a moment, finding them rather helpful. Copper smiled at Tod who smiled back, and then the two got to the bush. Tod and Copper looked into the bush and saw a pink crystal, which Tod pulled out, and then Copper asked something. \"What do you think it is?\" \"Looks like a crystal;\" Tod said. \"It's pretty easy to identify, especially for me, since I watch a lot of adventure movies.\" Copper seemed somewhat oblivious to Tod's mention of adventure movies, but kept up with him as they looked at the crystal. Tod felt a sudden power from within the crystal, sensing a light of hope. \"This feels...weird. Like a second home.\" \"How does that work?\" Copper asked, intrigued by Tod's statement. \"I don't know Copper;\" Tod said, wanting to know more. \"Let's head to Jake. He could know.\" Copper nodded and then ran off with Tod, who had a look of determination and excitement in his eyes. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper arriving at Tod's house, as Tod openes the door Tod and Copper walked inside and found Jake sitting on the couch. \"Hey Jake? I gotta ask you something;\" Tod asked, and Jake looked at him. \"Yeah Tod?\" \"Okay, so this is my friend Copper;\" Tod said, and Copper waved his paw. \"And we found this pink crystal in the woods. The weird thing though, is that when I touched it, it showed me what looked like a family. And I was in it.\" \"Huh. That's pretty weird;\" Jake said, being rather interested in the case. \"We were wondering if you knew anything about it;\" Copper asked, and then Jake kneeled down to Tod. Tod handed Jake the crystal, and Jake examined it to see how it worked. Jake realized what the crystal was and and stood up, becoming serious. \"Tod, Copper, come with me.\" Jake runs off and Copper turns to Tod. \"He can understand us perfectly.\" \"Yeah, it's pretty cool;\" Tod said, as he and Copper ran off. Scene cuts to Jake hooking the crystal up to his laptop as Tod and Copper arrive Sky and Copper hopped up to Jake's chair just as the research was done. Jake printed out a copy of the crystal readings, getting the information that he needed. Jake grabbed the printed copy and read it over, getting exactly what he thought he would, much to his fear. \"I was worried this would come up. \"Worried what would come up?\" Tod asked, and then Jake handed the paper to him, letting him read it. Tod and Copper read the paper over and became surprised by what they found. Tod looked at the crystal again, shocked to how he could forget about this. \"I have a brother and sister?\" \"It says you're all connected to the crystal too;\" Copper said. \"I wonder why it'd to that. \"It says so right here after the part you pointet out;\" Tod said, hoping to get more information out of this paper. Tod then became shocked by the last part of the paper. Then the last line of the paper was shown, allowing the viewer to read it without someone else saying it for them. The one thing that may shock Tod, is that being the middle child, he is the chosen one to take down Signal. Tod gave the paper back to Jake, the young fox kit looking shocked by the information. Jake looked to see Tod shocked and hopped out of his chair and walked over to his window. \"Well we may not have to worry about that for a while.\" Jake then put on an upbeat and caring smile as he turned to the fox kit and bloodhound puppy. \"Whatya say I take you two to your first rock concert?\" \"Rock concert?\" Tod and Copper said in sync. \"It's like the music I listen to, only you go somewhere else to listen to it;\" Jake explained, feeling as if it'd snap Tod out of his confused mood. Tod and Copper looked at each other with a smile and high fived in excitement. \"We're in!\" Scene cuts to a tower in the middle of Paris, with a female vixen kit walking over to a male governor \"You wished to speak with me Signal?\" The governor asked in a serious tone. \"This's better be good.\" Signal gave the governor a serious glare, showing that she means business. \"If you shut up, it will be. I've taken it upon myself that you appear to own China. Is that correct? I'd be willing to take it off of your hands if you like.\" The governor became shocked by Signal's statement. \"And what makes you think I'd just give up my land!? I know well enough what you're capable of!\" \"Yes, I know. Which is exactly why taking your troops will increase my power, which my hometown strived to take from me;\" Signal said, hinting at a possibly sad backstory. \"As you know, I didn't have the best childhood. Heck, it wasn't even in the top five. I figured you'd be a bit more generous.\" \"Then you thought wrong;\" The governor said in a serious tone. \"You may be a big part of Paris, but I'ma much higher class species.\" Signal rolled her eyes, remaining serious at the same time. \"Very well then. I'll just take HALF your land. The more...destroyed one, if you will.\" The governor became somewhat offended by this comment, but remained calm. \"My land is fine, thank you very much. How can a twelve year old like YOU possibly stop me?\" Signal snapped her fingers, creating some stairs in front of her, as well as a wall that held the governor back. Signal walked up the stairs in a menocing way. \"I'm not going to play nice.\" Upon that last word, Signal pushed the governor's face back just by glaring at it. \"Don't forget, I killed my mother and took her name five years ago just to give her that well deserved karma. Now please keep calm, as I'll be increasing my land with yours.\" Signal glares even harder, showing her dark powers from within, making the governor nod his head yes in a fearful manner. Signal smiles sadisticly, glad to see her newest slave on board. \"Wonderful. How about we start with your complete and total surrender?\" Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Jake arriving at the front row of the rock concert Tod is seen with an excited look on his face, knowing this would be an exciting time. \"This is gonna be so cool! I've never been to an actual rock show before.\" \"I've heard about them;\" Copper said, seeming rather skeptical of the whole thing. \"I do like what I enjoyed from it, but some of it just feels like people shouting a bunch of words. I never really got those songs.\" \"That's just them having fun Copper;\" Tod explained. \"I heard a lot of rock in my time before I could go outside on my own. Heck, I even took up playing a guitar.\" \"That was one of his later activities just so you know;\" Jake confirmed. \"He's getting better though. Now he can play actual songs. And good vocals.\" \"He means I have a better voice than him;\" Tod said, gaining a blank stare from Jake. Just then, the announcer came onto the stage with a sad look on his face. \"Everyone, I'm sorry to say this, but the band will not be playing tonight.\" The crowd started complaining with Copper looking at Tod, who shrugged in confusion, as the announcer continued his words. \"And with everyone upset, I'll be willing to accept any players from the crowd.\" Tod saw his chance to have some fun and pulled his guitar out of his backpack. Tod ran up to the stage, confusing Jake, and then Tod ran up to the announcer. \"Yo dude.\" The announcer looked down to see Tod holding his guitar. \"Ah, it looks like we have someone. What's your name kid.\" \"Names Tod;\" Tod said, sounding rather confident. First time playing in front of a crowd, no biggie.\" \"Very well then. Show us what you've got;\" The announcer said, glad to see Tod ready to rock out. \"Will do;\" Tod said, and then chuckles a bit. \"Just keep in mind that I'm no Linkin park.\" Scene cuts to Terra sneaking around town, arriving at the concert building Terra was seen walking into the building, seeming satisfied that she got there undetected. Terra ran up to the front, spotting a familiar face playing their guitar on the stage. Tyler was seen walking into the building, holding a ticket in his paw. Tyler went into four leg mode just as he spotted a familiar face just like Terra did. Tod continued playing until he heard Terra speak in an upbeat tone. \"Mind if I join in on the fun dude?\" Tod smiled, allowing Terra to play, just as she dumped her drum kit out of her pack. Terra pressed a button on her pack, allowing the drum kit to form by itself, much to Tod's fascination. \"Cool!\" Terra sat down on the seat of her drum kit, just as Tyler walked up, speaking in a calm and good natured tone. \"Don't mind me crashing in on the party.\" Tyler pulled out a keytar from his pack with Tod allowing him to join in. Signal was seen in an airship above the concert building, hearing music that sounds rather familiar. Signal ran up to the pilot, grabbing his vest collar. \"That's them Victor. I'd know that music just about anywhere.\" Victor nodded, setting the ship into auto pilot and then hopping out of his seat, walking over to the robot spawners. Signal looked at the prophecy scanner, becoming satisfied by the flawless results. Keeping a serious face, Signal walked off to where Victor was. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Jake walking downtown, with Tod spotting Terra by the ice cream shop Tod tugged Jake's shorts, signaling him to if they could head to the ice cream shop. Copper smiled at the idea and Jake nodded his head yes, letting them head on over. Tod, Copper, and Jake walked up to the shop with Tod looking at Jake. \"Get me a double chocolate;\" Tod said, and Jake nodded, walking up to the stand. Tod walked up to the table Terra was sitting at, greeting her with a kind tone. \"Terra, right?\" Terra looked to see Tod standing there, smiling as she let him sit next to her. \"You guessed it. You must be Tod. The one who started the whole show back there.\" Tod nodded and gave Terra a fist bump, just as Copper sat next to him. \"This the Terra girl you told me about?\" \"Yep. She was the one with the drum kit;\" Tod explained, and then turned to Terra. \"This is my best friend Copper. We've only known each other for a couple of days now, but we hit it off pretty well.\" Terra took a liking to Tod and Copper being friends, finding it rather interesting. \"A fox and a dog. That's something you don't see every day.\" Terra gave a tsundere like smile. \"I like it.\" Tod and Copper took a liking to Terra's upbeat tsundere like attitude. Tod then went to ask how Terra got the kit she did. \"So how did you get a drum kit so awesome that it could make itself? I've never seen anything like it before.\" \"I bought it in the super expensive isle that gave us all the awesome tech stuff;\" Terra explained, and then got bummed out about something. \"It's just a shame summer's almost over.\" \"Hey cmon Terra, it can't be THAT bad;\" Tod said, and then Copper joined in. \"Besides. You'll get to see your friends again, right? The faraway ones anyway.\" Terra shrugged, leading to Tod speaking again. \"It could be really fun Terra. I can't wait for second grade.\" \"Pssh. Nerd;\" Terra said in a snarky tone, leading to Copper thinking about his own school year. \"School's fun in some places, but it's also hard. I barely got past first grade. Something about not getting science right, and then something about the room catching on fire when I left. Didn't even notice.\" Tod and Terra snickered a bit at Copper's statement, thinking that something funny must've happened. Scene cuts to Signal spotting Tyler walking up to the ice cream shop, getting ready to plan her attack Tyler looked to see Tod, Copper, and Terra chatting, interested in talking with the two he recently played with. Tyler walked over to the three and sat down next to them. \"Tod and Terra, right? You guys were awesome. \"Thanks dude;\" Tod said. \"Tyler right?\" Terra asked, and Tyler nodded. \"I'm Copper;\" Copper said, giving a smile as Tyler waved. Just then, a gun shot was heard, freaking everyon out except for the main four and Jake. Jake takes the ice cream over to Tod and Copper, who grab it, only for more gun shots to be heard. A military soldier jumps through the window, aiming his gun at Tod and the others. Jake flipped the table over just in time, only for the soldier to pull out a shotgun and continue shooting \"What the heck is going on here!?\" Terra shouted, clearly outraged by the sudden attack. \"I come here to have a relaxing time, and that loser over there tries to shoot us! And why us anyway!?\" Tod realized what the paper Jake printed out told him as Terra continued. \"And why when YOU three showed up anyway!?\" \"We're your brothers!\" Tod said, pointing to him and Tyler, confusing the oldest. \"We are?\" The table gets destoryed and Jake rushes in, signaling Tod and the others to run. Tod turns to Terra, grabbing her paw, and signaling Tyler to grab Copper's, which he does. \"Make sure you and Copper keep up with us Tyler. Follow me to somewhere safe.\" \"Fine with me. If you know about us being related then it's best to trust you;\" Tyler said, keeping his cool about the situation. \"We'll explain later. Tod's owner Jake will hold off for now.\" Copper explained, and then Tod ran off while pulling Terra with her, his sister clearly being terrified. Tyler pulled Copper along with the two following after Tod and Terra, Tod's eyes being shown with determination. To be continued.[Chapter 2] The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy Season one Episode two: Unlikely friends Part two. Previously. On The hidden prodigy. The forest was shown in a dark and depressing mood, showing how sad this is for the mother and her children. The mother ran past a hunting field as she avoided all of the hunters, making them just barely miss her. The mother ran up to a fence, setting her child down. \"Son. You need to listen to me;\" The mother said, and her child looked at her. Jake shrugged and walked back to the sink, and then Tod ran over to the door. \"Can I go outside now? Can I, Can I, Can I? Please?\" Jake rolled his eyes while smiling, liking Tod's excitement. \"Go ahead Tod. Just don't go too far.\" \"Yeah!\" Tod ran outside the door and ran off into the meadow, loving the area. Tod looked over the area for a few seconds, letting the air soak in. Tod breathed in the fresh air and then runs off to play. Tod walked over to the end of the log and looked inside. \"Whatya smelling?\" Copper looked at Tod. \"I'm on a trail.\" Tod became curious to what Copper's looking for. \"A trail for what?\" \"I don't know yet;\" Copper said, and then he continued sniffing, stopping when his nose went to Tod. \"Why it's, it's you.\" Terra ran over to the soccer ball and picked it up, getting an excited look for what she was planning. \"Just enough time to practice for soccer tryouts.\" Tyler turned the tv on and then began studying as Lila walked in. \"Studying with the tv on?

Tyler pulled Copper along with the two following after Tod and Terra, Tod's eyes being shown with determination. Scene cuts to Tod and the others, excluding Jake, who was still fighting the robots, running through town to get to safety. Tod looked around for a safe place to hide, knowing that he and Copper were the only ones who knew enough. Tod spotted an alley and signaled the others to follow him inside, which they did with no question, trusting that Tod could help them. Tod and the others ran into the alley, walking up to the end of a wall. Tod then got ready to explain everything, hoping that the others would understand. \"Okay. This could take a few minutes, but I hope you're all on board.\" Terra and Tyler nod as Copper sits down next to Tod, who then smiles, glad that his siblings were on board. \"Okay then. Here's the whole story.\" Three minutes later. \"So basically, our mom seperated us all at birth when Signal attacked;\" Tod explained, holding back his tears from his mother's death. \"Our mom died after she dropped ME off, and I don't know what happened then. All I know is that we have to put a stop to Signal's reign. Terra and Tyler appeared confused and fearful of the situation, Terra especially, being that she's the toungest of the siblings. Terra then started breathing heavily, being too scared to stop. \"Okay. So some crazy lady's gonna come and kill us, no biggie.\" Terra then punches Tod in his arm, making him whine in pain. \"Why didn't you mention this before we were attacked!?\" \"I'm sorry! I didn't add up the pieces until the robots came;\" Tod shouted, mad at Terra for punching him. \"Well do it faster next time!\" Terra argued back. \"I mean, it's awesome that I have two brohters, but you could've at least said so when we WEREN'T being hunted down!\" Copper was seen being scared of the two's arguing, wanting to help them get along. \"Um...guys-\" \"Shut up!\" Tod and Terra's snap made Copper back up into a wall as the two continued. \"I honestly don't see HOW I could've done that!\" Tod shouted. \"This is the first time we met, aka, the only time we've met.\" Tyler broke the two apart, glaring at both of them one at a time, starting with Tod. Tod understood his older brother's glare, knowing that it wasn't the best time to be fighting. Tyler then glared to Terra, who understood as well, putting her anger aside as Tyler spoke. \"I know this is a lot to take in. Heck, I'm having trouble coping with it myself. But fighting won't help.\" Tod and Terra seemed impressed by Tyler's maturity. \"Now I want you two to apologize before we move on.\" Tod and Terra looked at each other, with Tod rubbing his arm and Terra seeming frustrated. \"Sorry.\" Tyler smiled and rubbed his siblings heads, which Tod liked, but Terra was embarrassed by. \"Tyler;\" Terra whined, and Tyler stopped and turned to Copper. \"You okay Copper?\" Tod asked, and Copper nodded with a smile, glad to see the siblings getting along again. Tod signaled everyone to follow him, which they did once Tod ran off. Scene cuts to Tod and the others arriving at Tod's home, successfully avoiding all the robots. Tod opened the front door and let the others in, going in after them and closing the door. Tod walked into the living room with the others and turned on a light, speaking in a firm tone. \"Jake should be able to hold them off for now. He's more than capable of self defense.\" Tod walked up to the tv and turned it on, changing it to the was seen getting a soda from Tod's fridge, seeming to not care what he said. Terra kicked the fridge door closed and walked over to the others, sitting down next to tyler. Tod sat down next to copper and they started talking about what was happening. \"This is honestly really scary guys;\" Copper confessed, showing his timidness once again. \"Out of everything I thought about, nothing would ever be this.\" Copper then turned to Tod, wanting to know how he's taking this. \"I know this is a serious question Tod, but how did you cope with your mom's death?\" Tod flinched at Copper's question, feeling a waterfall of fear as he heard it. \"I honestly never got over it. I still think about it sometimes, and yeah, I'm mostly a bubbly and optomistic kid, but I still have my times.\" Tod held back his tears again as Copper hugged him, patting his friend on the back. Terra was seen being snarky about the whole thing, trying to hide her true feelings. \"Stop being such a baby Tod. Do you really expect me to feel anything?\" Copper looked at Terra with a confused look, wondering if she was hiding her true feelings. \"I'm just saying Copper. Tod should toughen up.\" Tyler put his paw on Terra's head, looking at her with a concerned tone. \"Except Tod isn't like us Terra. He actually SAW mom die.\" Terra then looked at her brother and thought of how she would feel in his position, feeling at least fifty pounds of guilt come from within. The usual sporty and snarky fun loving tsundere felt a new emotion from within. Tod the pulled Copper away, smiling at his friend for comforting him. \"I'm gonna head to my room now.\" Copper nodded and Tod walked off, putting on a gloomy and despaired face as he walked up the stairs. Scene cuts to Terra walking up to Tod's room, knocking on his door. \"Come in!\" Upon hearing Tod's voice, Terra breathed in and out, hoping that Tod wouldn't be mad at her for her earlier behavior. Terra gulped up her fear and walked in to find Tod at the computer. \"Tod?\" Tod looked to see Terra at the door, getting off of the chair to speak with her. \"Yeah sis?\" Terra rubbed her arm for a bit, never doing before what she was about to do. Feeling the guilt surround her again, though not as big as before, still affected her in how she was going to do what she planned on doing. She stayed still for a few seconds, confusing Tod, but she eventually spoke. \"Tod, I know I was mean earlier, and I guess it was because of the fact that I was hiding my true feelings on mom's death.\" Tod seemed interested in what Terra was saying, allowing her to continue. \"I mean, I obviously didn't witness mom die in any way possible, so I couldn't have known.\" Terra then turned around and looked at the wall. \"Anyone with a functioning brain would know that it's impossible to feel something the same as someone else without being there. That's likely why I don't feel as bad as you do about it.\" Tod then spoke in an understanding tone. \"Yeah, that's understandable.\" Terra then turned back to her brother, walking up to him with love and hope. \"I'm not exactly used to doing this, especially with people I only recently met. But what I'm trying to say Tod, is...I'm sorry. I should've been more caring and-\" Tod then hugged Terra, accepting her apology and smiling with joy. Terra wrapped her arms around her big brother, feeling that they could get a powerful bond between them. Tod then pulled Terra away and walked over to the window next to his bed, looking out and hoping for Jake to be okay. Terra walked over to Tod and hopped onto his back, allowing the two to smile at one another. Scene cuts to Jake arriving home while wiping a burn mark from his tail, then wiping his hands on his shirt as he walked inside. Jake closed the door as he then walked into the living room, surprised to see Tyler and Terra sleeping on his couch. Jake smiled, glad that they were able to get away from the danger. Jake then walked upstairs, hoping for Tod to be okay as well. Jake opened Tod's bedroom door a bit so he could see if he was in there, relieved to see that he was. Jake closed the door quietly and then walked off to his own room, walking over to his bed and lying down on it. Jake then thought about how Tod felt about his new siblings, worrying that something bad could happen to all of them. Jake decided to push those feelings away for now, as to not worry Tod, and went to sleep. Scene cuts to Tod waking up the next morning and looking out his window. \"Okay Tod. You may have just witnessed some crazy robots trying to kill you yesterday, but it'll be okay;\" Tod said, trying to reassure himself, and then he turned to the audience \"It'll be okay, right?\" Tod got off of his bed and walked out of his room, closing the door behind him before going down the stairs. \"I mean, you saw what happened, so maybe you can comment in your review or something if you think it'll be okay. That'd be awesome.\" Tod arrived at the downstairs and sat next to Terra, who was watching tv. \"Hey Terra. What're you watching?\" \"The Legend of Kion;\" Terra replied, being rather fascinated by what she just said. \"This episode's about when Jasiri got transfered to Kion's school. You'd have to watch the first episode and onward if you'd wanna catch up.\" Tod looked at the tv, being rather interested in the show Terra was watching. Despite wanting to watch the show, Tod knew he couldn't cancel on Copper. \"Thanks for the offer Terra, but I have plans with Copper. I don't wanna get so hooked that I miss out on it.\" \"Pssh. Your loss dude;\" Terra said in a snarky tone. \"I'll just show you another time.\" Tod nodded and walked off to the kitchen to get some breakfast. Scene cuts to Tod walking over to Copper's barrel, to which Chief notices while eating. \"Hey now, what the heck are YOU doing here?\" Chief asked in a stern tone. Tod then turned to Chief, feeling rather sassy as he did so. \"Hanging out with a friend. I'm guessing you don't know what those are? Chief becomes shocked by Tod's insult and gets mad. \"Oh, I know what friends are, I just don't want Copper hanging out with you. He told me about what happened yesterday and I'm not putting him through that again.\" Tod turns to Copper, who shrugs, as Tod turns back to Chief. \"Look dude. I don't wanna be a jerk or anything, but it's not like I WANTED Copper to witness that. And he didn't even get scratched.\" \"It's true Chief;\" Copper said, backing his friend up, fearing what could happen if he didn't. \"If Tod tried to get me hurt then he wouldn't have even wanted to come over.\" \"Eh, I guess you have a point;\" Chief said, barely standing what Copper was doing. \"Fine. You two can hang out. But don't let me hear about any more fo that robot nonsense.\" Just then, a gun shot was heard, shocking the three as it came close to them. \"What the heck was that!?\" Tod shouted in fear, and then an elderly hunter was seem holding a shotgun. \"And who's cruel enough to shoot at a kid!?\" \"That's amos kid;\" Chief said, leaning over to Tod to whisper his plan. \"I hope you're a good actor, so get ready to run.\" Tod became confused at what Chief said, only to be found chasing from the wolfhound while Chief was barking, sending miles of fear into Copper. Tod looked back at Chief, finding his ways to be rather brute. Tod ran inside the chicken coop, to which Chief got stuck in due to his size, and had his barrel slam against his butt, due to it being tied to him. Chief continued barking and Tod pinned himself against the wall, only to realize how silly Chief looked. Tod started laughing, much to the wolfound's confusion, until he realized the situation he was in. Chief started laughing too, and then talking was heard outside. \"And your fox was after my chickens, so I had to shoot!\" Chief pulled himself out of the coop at the sound of Amos's voice, letting Tod out for both of them to see Jake and Amos talking. \"Was he near your chicken coop?\" Jake asked, sounding rather serious as he did so. \"Well, no, he wasn't;\" Amos replied, not seeing Jake's point. \"So how could he have gone after your chickens?\" Jake asked, and Amos rolled his eyes in annoyence. Chief turned to Tod, signaling him to run off to Copper, which he did. Tod ran up to Copper, signaling him to come with him, which he did once his friend ran off. The two friends ran into the forest, ignoring Jake and Amos's arguing, and ran off to find the pond they found. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper in the pond with Tod thinking about his family. Copper noticed his friend feeling down and swam over to him and went next to him, laying his arms on the land as he does so. \"Something up buddy?\" Tod looked at Copper with a bummed out expression, clearly upset about something major. \"I guess. I don't know.\" \"You can always tell me;\" Copper said, coming up onto land and showing care for Tod. \"I know we just met a couple days ago, but I'm all ears if you wanna talk. Tod smiled at Copper's words, feeling rather touched by what he said. He then thought for a moment and decided that Copper was nice enough to speak to this about. Even if he was a bit air-headed. Tod then lied down on the grass, trying to keep a positive expression. \"It's just that I wanna know more about my family. All I know is that my mom seperated me and my siblings sometime after I was born, and then she died. What about my dad? What did HE do during that time?\" Copper started to feel for Tod, not knowing his own parents either. \"Yeah, I can relate. When Amos adopted me as a baby puppy, the one thing I could remember was how to eat.\" Tod gave his friend a blank expression, confused to what Copper just said. \"Aren't baby dogs and puppys the same thing?\" \"I mean younger than I am;\" Copper explained, and then he continued. \"But we'll find your family eventually Tod. I just know it.\" Copper then put his paw on Tod's shoulder, letting him know that everything was gonna be okay. \"I know I can't do as much as Jake can, or Terra, or Tyler, but the least I can do is try. Well, that or nothing, but I'm going with the former.\" Tod rolled his eyes while smiling, showing that he quickly got used to Copper's air-headed side. \"Maybe your dad's still out there somewhere. We just have to look.\" Tod placed Copper's words to heart, feeling touched and moved by what he'd said at that time. Tod looked at his friend with a smile on his face, both of them glad to see one another happy. Tod hugged Copper tight and Copper wrapped his arms around him, letting the moment sink in for them. Just then, the pond started shaking and a knight surrounded by a dark aura rose from it, freaking Copper out. \"What the heck is that?\" \"I don't know, but it looks awesome;\" Tod said, and then he walked closer to get a sneak peak. Tod felt as if he could deal with the knight, wanting to challenge it. Tod walked closer to the knight, only for the knight to slash at him, barely giving him time to duck. \"Yeah, we should run.\" Tod and Copper ran off with the knight chasing after them. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper running up to a cliff, looking back to see the knight still after them. Tod and Copper look at each other and Tod grabs Copper's paw, jumping down the cliff and bringing him with. Copper closed his eyes in fear, only to open them and feel somewhat alive. Tod ran across the wall and Copper ran with him, ignoring the knight flying towards them. Tod and Copper arrived at a cliff and jumped onto it and Tod picked up a rock, throwing it directly at the knight, who caught it and crushed it. Tod grabbed Copper and ran with him into a cave, leading to it closing on them. The knight's sword was seen trapped inside the wall as the knight struggled to get it out. Tod and Copper looked at the sword until they heard a young female voice. \"That's one way to live.\" Tod and Copper looked behind themselves and saw a female vixen about Tod's age walking towards them, with Tod smiling in joy and relief as he and Copper walked over to her. \"Thank god we're not the only ones in here. Some knight thought it'd be a good idea to chase us down here.\" \"It's gotta be one of the craziest things I've ever been through;\" Copper said in a freaked out tone, remembering the day before. \"And yesterday we dealt with robot's attacking the city and Tod's lost family members.\" The vixen seemed to take interest in Tod's name, becoming more than intrigued by it. \"Tod?\" The vixen inspected Tod, who giggled as she sniffed him, leaving Copper confused. The vixen finished her inspection, standing in front of Tod and Copper while looking at the two, becoming rather excited as she did so. \"Just as I thought. You're the middle child of Ayano. And the chosen one.\" Tod and Copper became confused, yet excited by what the vixen just said. \"Chosen one?\" \"It's a long story;\" The vixen said, satisfied to finally have found Tod. \"I'd recommend following me for a greater detail.\" Tod and Copper looked at each other and then back at the vixen, conflicted on weather or not to trust her. The vixen rolled her eyes and grabbed Tod and Copper by their collars, pulling them alongside her and making them walk. The vixen then lead Tod and Copper into a secret room hidden in a cave, showing it to also be her home. Tod and Copper appeared to be amazed by what the home brought in storage, loving the pink crystal enviorment, as well as the ruby and saphirre wood supplies. The vixen opened up a drawer in her dresser, pulling out a green book. The vixen walked over to Tod and Copper with a smile on her face, feeling rather excited to show them what she found. \"Okay. So you two wanted to know about the chosen one since I brought it up, right?\" Tod and Copper nodded their heads yes, leading to the vixen signaling them to follow her as she ran into a room, which they did with Tod feeling optomistic, and Copper feeling worried about what's to come. Scene cuts to Vixey running into a pitch black room in her place, with Tod and Copper arriving right after. Tod and Copper looked around the room to see nothing, much to Tod's dissapointment. \"It's just a black room. What's so fun about this?\" The vixen gave Tod a smirk as she then clapped her paws in her own rhythm *clap, clap clap*, causing the room to turn into what looked like a small but stable library. Tod becan to see more fun in this room as they walked over to a table with the vixen, who opened the book to show them a picture of Tod's mother. \"This is Ayano. That pink crystal on her necklace holds all of the power in the town of Paris. If it breaks, everyone could turn to Signal for her rule.\" \"That's my mom?\" Tod said in an amazed fashion, remembering when the vixen mentioned his mother's name. \"She looks so...pretty.\" \"She sure does;\" Copper said, finding Ayano to be looking right for motherhood. \"I'd want her as MY mom.\" Tod then realized that the vixen never mentioned her name. \"Hey. I just realized we never got your name.\" The vixen gave out a soft giggle at Tod's question, showing she rarely revealed her name, giving Tod a confused expression at her action. \"The name's Vixey. I'm a rouge warrior who escaped the clutches of Signal long ago. I'd tell you plenty more, but we should be getting you two home.\" Vixey hopped off her chair as Copper went with her, leaving Tod to look into the picture and feel that his family could become empty one day. Not wanting his family to lose itself, Tod grabbed the picture from Vixey's book and walked off. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper walking through the woods with Vixey. \"So where exactly do you guys live?\" Vixey asked, and Tod and Copper pointed over to their houses, giving Vixey a smile at her short journey. \"Oh, perfect. I think we all know we wouldn't want this to turn into the hobbit.\" Tod laughed a bit at Vixey's joke as they walked out of the forest. \"I know, right? The hobbit's just so long and boring.\" \"And I never really got the point of it being lord of the rings;\" Copper said, and then Tod ran up to his house. \"This is my stop;\" Tod said, and then waved goodbye to Copper and Vixey. \"Later Vixey!\" \"Yeah, bye Vixey!\" Copper said as well as he arrived at Tod's porch. \"You know where to find me if you wanna learn more about your family!\" Vixey shouted back, and Tod nodded and Vixey ran off, allowing Tod and copper to walk inside. Tod thought about when he took the picture, feeling as if it was wrong. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper watching tv, seeming rather intrigued by the show they're watching. \"So they remade a series before it even finished?\" Copper asked, confused on the show's timeline. \"That's pretty weird.\" \"No, they just made a version to appeal to THEIR fans;\" Tod explained, seeming interested in what was happening. \"The creator was super cool about it.\" Tod and Copper continued to watch the show until Tod had a vision. Tod saw Signal in his vision, gaining a sense of fear from seeing her. Signal walked closer to Tod with Copper wrapped around her arm, as well as her holding a knife up to his neck. Tod began breathing heavily, much to the fear of Copper, who grabbed him in an attempt to snap him back to reality. \"Tod, stop breathing so fast. What's wrong?\" Tod doesn't hear Copper and continues to have the vision. \"Tod!\" Tod starts choking himself until Copper punches him in the face, making him fall off the couch. Copper looks at his paw with regret, realizing what he just did. \"Tod...I'm sorry, I wasn't-\" \"No, it's fine;\" Tod said, standng up and giving his friend a smile. \"You did the right thing.\" Knowing that he would've stayed in the vision trance if not for Copper's sudden attack, Tod hugged his best friend and he wrapped his arms around him. Jake was seen walking over to Tod and Copper, holding his phone as he did so. \"I just called the owners of Tyler and Terra. They were both on voicemail.\" Tod and Copper find this to be rather suspicious as Tod pulls Copper away, both of them fearing what could come out of this. \"I know, it's frightening to think what could happen if they lost their owners.\" Jake smiled, remembering his guest bedroom. \"We'll let them stay here for now.\" Tod and Copper smiled and nodded, being on board with Jake's plan. \"Just one question Jake;\" Tod said, curious to who was in his vision. \"I had this vision just now about another fox. She was holding a knife up to Copper's neck, and I was so scared that I couldn't move.\" Tod tried to hold back his fear from the vision, as to not scare Jake. \"Who was that?\" Jake shrugged, seeming to not know who Tod was talking about. Tod thought about his vision a bit more, feeling something greatly dark coming. Scene cuts to Jake introducing Tyler and Terra to their bedroom, which they take a liking to. Terra looked around the room and took a liking to her side, enjoying the sporty aspect of it. \"Just my style!\" Terra hops onto her bed with joy and relaxation in her voice and eyes. \"I could get used to this. For truth, I do hope we find Terry. But this is gonna be super comfy. I'm gonna love it here.\" Tyler looked over to his side of the room and enjoyed the musical and calm atmosphere. \"Thanks Jake. This is awesome.\" Tyler hopped onto his bed with a calm and light hearted tone in his voice. \"Once we fine Lila, we've gotta show her this. She loves old timey rooms.\" \"I figured you two would like it;\" Jake said, satisfied with their thoughts on the room. \"I was gonna put a tv in here, but I didn't have enough money for a third.\" \"That's fine;\" Terra said, looking out her window and loving the view. \"I usually prefer more move around activities anyway. I'll watch tv every now and then, but if I feel like it, I'll grab my soccer ball.\" Tyler was seen playing his guitar, feeling a calm and soothing voice from within him as he began to sing Look on the bright side. Calm and catchy music even played as he did so. \"The times as of now may be tough, but I won't lose my hope.\" Jake and Terra appeared to take a liking to Tyler's singing. \"As long as I look at the bright side, the darkness is easy to cope.\" Tod and Copper heard Tyler singing and walked up to the attic, where the guest bedroom for Tod's siblings was. \"I know it sounds rather challenging, and I agree, that's true. But the bright side does exist even if the bad one does too.\" Tod walked up to Tyler, wanting to hear the song from the best angle possible as Tyler continued. \"I know that it's hard, and also rather, painful. But as the brightness shines, and the darkness will foil.\" Tyler nodded to Tod, knowing that he wanted to sing, and brought his little brother up to sing with him. Tod felt somewhat nervous, as he'd never sang before, and Tyler looked at him with a smile of encouragment. \"The light will shine, so will the dark, the ladder rots on this tree bark. But even so, I won't lose my fai-ai-aith.\" Tod appeared to enjoy singing quite a bit, trying to hide his energy flowing. \"After all that, we've all been through, I won't try to choose destiny for you.\" Copper was shown to be swaying at the beat of the song. \"We'll always stay together, for all time.\" Tod and Tyler then began singing together, feeling their brotherly bond embraced. \"Even if the light, is put by the dark, in a bide. We'll always join, together and, look on, the bright side.\" Tyler played for a bit longer and finished the song with the perfect lyrics. \"Look on the bright side.\" Terra whistled at the song and Jake clapped to it, with Copper jumping up to his best friend and hugging him, with Tyler giving his brother a head rub. Scene cuts to Tod looking out his window at nighttime, hoping for more adventure to come as he turned to the audience. \"I'll admit, it's not easy finding out about your family so far in;\" Tod said in an optomistic and upbeat tone. \"But even so, sometimes it's not all that bad to find out about hidden secrets.\" Tod then looked at the picture he took from Vixey's place. \"Some secrets can even lead to new friends.\" Tod got into his covers, hoping to wake up to an exciting day. \"Now I know some things are like, super hard to follow, and I won't get along with my siblings right away.\" Tod looked out the window and waved to Copper, who waved back at him before going to sleep. \"But one thing's for sure.\" Tod turned off the light in his room. \"Family is forever.\" Tod then put the pink crystal he found on his collar, wanting to be close to his mother. \"And I won't give that up.\" Tod went to sleep and then the screen faded to black ending the episode off. Anime rock music played during the credits as the song Prophecy was heard while a male singer was heard. \"This is the power of my friends, and family with it. Even if it's not all that simple and has hard stuff to fit. I know there's more to me than being a simple kid. But for my siblings life, that's nothign that I'd bid. It's complicated, but I don't care. My life may just flash like a flare. But as long as you're here I could care less! Even if I die today! It'll be a noble decay! My family's not something I'd give up so easily! My friends and family, are important to me! And I will find the truth in the prophecy! That's right, I will find the truth in the prophecy.\"[Chapter 3] The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy Season one Episode three: Friend in a wolf Anime rock music played during the credits as the song Prophecy was heard while a male singer was heard. Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest as a male started singing. \"This is the power of my friends, and family with it.\" Tod and Copper jumped into a pond and started splashing one another along with a wolf cub. \"Even if it's not all that simple and has hard stuff to fit.\" Terra was seen at the top of a tree as she jumped from the highest branch. \"I know there's more to me than being a simple kid.\" Terra cannonballed into the pond, splashing Tyler, who was seen tuning his guitar. \"But for my siblings life, that's nothing that I'd bid.\" Tyler jumped into the pool and Vixey popped up next to Tod, making the fox kit blush and smile while rubbing his arm. \"It's complicated, but I don't care. My life may just flash like a flare.\" Tod and the others were seen punching, kicking, and biting Signal's minions. \"But as long as you're here I could care less!\" Jake was seen slashing the robots in half with a sword. \"Even if I die today!\" Signal's eyes were shown with a dark glow. \"It'll be a noble decay!\" Tod and Signal were seen punching and kicking one another in the air. \"My family's not something I'd give up so easily!\" Tod shot a bullet at Signal, who deflected it right back at Tod and his him in the knee. \"My friends and family, are important to me! Tod sneered at Signal and managed to charge at her. \"And I will find the truth in the prophecy!\" Tod glowed a bright red color and then he aimed a punch at Signal upon the final lyrics. \"That's right, I will find the truth in the prophecy.\" Tod and the others were seen going onto the title screen, with Tod front flipping onto the screen next to Copper, being adventurous and optimistic, Copper being kind and timid, Terra skateboarding onto the screen with tsundere feistiness and playfulness, Tyler tuning his guitar and giving a peace sign to the audience with care and calmness, the wolf kicking down the door and flipping off the audience, showing his cocky and selfish side, Vixey showing her bookworm and researcher side when walking on screen, and Jake slashing through the wall and jumping on with the others, and then The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy appeared behind them. Scene cuts to Tod sneaking off into the forest with Copper, having mischevious looks on their faces. \"Wow Copper. That old timer sure is friendly;\" Tod said in a happy tone, refering to how easily Chief let Copper come. \"Even if he is a bit grumpy.\" \"Yeah, but people get more like that when they're older;\" Copper said, and then got confused by his own words. \"Or is it the opposite?\" Tod laughed a bit at Copper's denseness and gave him a friendly paw shove. \"What, you playin air-head kid or playin tag?\" Tod ran off playfully, allowing Copper to chase after him. Tod and Copper ran through the forest as Tod then frontflipped over a log, impressing Copper with his acrobatic skills. Copper jumped over the log, but just barely made it, making Tod snicker a bit as Copper gave chase again. Tod ran off and dodged Copper's lunge as then Tod heard a wolf howl. Just then, a wolf tackled Tod and pinned him to the ground, laughing right into his face. \"Got ya loser! Next time try something called, dodging.\" The wolf laughed some more as Tod pushed him off with frustration, whining as he spoke. \"No fair dude. We didn't even see you.\" \"That's the point dumbface;\" The wolf said, bonking his head repeatedly. \"It's called stealth. Look it up.\" Copper got into the wolf's face with an angry look. \"We don't have to look up nothing. What (puts his finger onto the wolf's chest) YOU need to do is look up the word nice.\" \"Does that apply for being stupid enough to get his butt kicked?\" The wolf said with a cocky smile, lifting up Copper and turning him to his backside. The wolf then went into two leg mode, surprising Tod and Copper, and then the wolf kicked Copper's literal butt, sending him into a rock. The wolf went back into four leg mode and started laughing on his back as Tod walked over to Copper, helping him up and both of them looking at the wolf. \"Maybe get some guts for the special olympics. Cause you might-\" Just then, a beehive landed into the wolf's paws, confusing him until he bees came out, making him get serious. \"Hey dude. Claws off the merchindise. It takes time to get this good.\" The bees started stinging the wolf just as he finished, stinging him rappidly every time he stepped, making him run off as he shouted in pain. He then felt his butt cheeks being spread out, only to have gotten stung in the butt right after, making him yell in pain again. \"Ow! Dude, getting my butt is cheap!\" The wolf then got stung more and more in multiple parts of his body, making him fall into the water with Tod and Copper laughing at him. Tod and Copper then got stung in their own butts, making them yelp, and then they rubbed the parts they got stung in. The wolf rolled his eyes as he scratched himself where it itched. The wolf then turned around and punched his arm in anger, leading to Tod and Copper feeling bad for his pain. The wolf punched his arm again and then saw Tod's paw as he was offered help up. The wolf accepted Tod's help in confusion. \"Why are you losers helping me?\" \"Cause it's cool to do nice things;\" Tod said, and then he walked off with Copper and the wolf. Scene cuts to Tod rubbing some soapy water onto the wolf's arm as Copper holds the ice next to him, with the wolf sitting in the kitchen sink. Tod finished with the last sting and the wolf looked to see himself all clean. \"Wow, thanks losers. So that lame stuff works then.\" \"Pretty much;\" Tod said with a nod, and then he nodded to Copper, who put the ice pack onto the wolf's head, making the wolf feel pain. \"Ow!\" Copper finished with the ice pack and then set it down, hopping down with Tod and the wolf, and then the wolf began to speak again. \"I'll admit, aside from the ice pack hurting, it was pretty cool of you guys to help me. (Chuckles a bit) Even after I picked on you.\" \"Water under the bridge dude;\" Tod said in an optomistic tone, feeling that helping others felt good. \"The other day we literally fought robots and found my long lost siblings.\" \"No way!\" The wolf said in an amazed tone. \"So where do you live?\" Copper asked, wanting to get the wolf home safely. \"Your parents are probably worried.\" The wolf flinched, getting down at the fact of being homeless. \"I...don't have either. I don't know my parents, so I don't know where my home is.\" Tod and Copper started to feel bad for the wolf, who tried to his tears of sorrow. Wanting to help the wolf find a home, Tod put his paw on the wolf's shoulder. \"Maybe we could build you a home.\" The wolf became surprised and looked at Tod, who gave him a caring smile. \"Even jerks deserve a place to live.\" The wolf smiled and playfully punched both Tod and Copper in the arms. \"Thanks losers.\" The wolf then realized that he never revealed his name. \"Oh yeah. And my names Kevin.\" \"Tod. Middle child of a hystoric mother. I think. A pleasure meeting you.\" \"Names Copper. Future hunter. Well, not of friends of course.\" Kevin nodded and walked off to the garage with Tod and Copper. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin in the garrage, hoping to find some useful stuff. Tod found a bunch of wood hidden behind some blankets, pulling it out with some struggle. Copper found some hats and put one on his head, sitting on the other for safe measure. Kevin found some paint cans and picked one up, taking it over to a wagon. Tod pulled the wood out, only for the blankets to fall on him. He lifted the blanket off of him with ease, since it was so light, and then dragged the wood across the floor. Copper ignored the screeching sound and grabbed a hammer, walking over to the wagon with it, wagging his tail at the thought of what they were doing. The trio put their stuff in and then looked around for some more things to use. Tod saw some nails on a shelf and jumped up onto the car, hopping up to the shelf and grabbing them. He then back flipped down from the shelf and walked off with a bubbly laugh. Copper grabbed a giant lash rope, not knowing what it was capable of doing. He walked over to the wagon and set it in as Tod put the nails in. Kevin set in some lunch boxes so they could feel like construction workers and then the trio headed off with excitement. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin walking through the forest with their building supplies. Tod turned to the audience, clarifying why he's doing what he's doing. \"I know what you're thinking dudes. Why am I helping someone who picked on me and my best friend? Well it's pretty simple really. As a pure hearted child, it feels right to do good things. So it's only natural that I'd be on board with this.\" Jake hopped onto Copper's back and started playing the bongos on the paint cans, making Tod and Copper laugh playfully. \"Plus, he'd make a good third member of our group. Especially since Vixey's place is pretty hard to get to.\" Tod, Copper, and Kevin started looking around for a good tree to build Kevin's house on. Copper then collapsed with the weight he was carrying being too much for him. \"Good thing Jake's at work, cause I think I broke one of his boards.\" Tod, Copper, and Kevin then laughed together with Kevin deciding on the tree in front of them. \"Let's just do this one before Copper dies. You got the ladder Tod?\" \"Sure do Kevin;\" Tod said, pointing to the ladder. \"It's on my tray after all.\" Tod set his stuff down carefully and then he and Kevin lifted the stuff off of Copper's back. Copper crawled out from the pile and high fived Tod and Kevin, having Tod give out a leaderlike speech. \"Okay guys. Now this house is gonna be made, and we're not gonna slack off. Unless it's for a lunch break, which I packed for.\" Kevin licked his lips, loving the thought of eating lunch. \"No need to worry about ME being picky Tod. I'd eat anything.\" \"Even logs?\" Copper asked, somewhat dense to what Kevin said. \"For survival, yeah. But I'd cook them.\" \"That makes more sense than eating it raw, to which it could poison you;\" Tod said, finding Kevin to be rather tough. \"Anyway, let's do this!\" Tod and Copper put their paws in and then offered to Kevin, who smiled at the inclusion. Kevin put his paw in and all three of them raised theirs. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin on Kevin's house, with the floorboards filled out with three planks on each end. Tod hammered in a nail to one of the walls, finishing it on the right end. Tod and Kevin looked at each other and high fived each other, and then Kevin walked over to Copper. Kevin saw that Copper's helmet was tied to his rear end, much to his confusion as he walked to where the helmet was. \"Copper, why's your helmet tied to your butt?\" \"For protection;\" Copper replied in an air-headed way. Kevin sighed and grabbed Copper's helmet, untying it. \"It's supposed to go on your head dude.\" \"You put it in YOUR places, (snatches the helmet back) And I'll put it in mine;\" Copper said with a grin. Tod looked to see his friends arguing over the helmet and walked over to them. \"Alright dudes, what's going on here?\" \"Copper's being an idiot;\" Kevin said in a cynical tone. \"Tell him he's putting the helmet on backwards.\" Tod looked at Copper, who shrugged, and then he looked back at Kevin. \"Does it matter?\" Kevin rolled his eyes as he walked off and leaned on a wall, only for it to fall over. \"Whoa!\" Kevin grabbed onto the planks and Tod and Copper ran over in a hurry. Tod nodded to Copper, who grabbed Tod's feet and lifted him over Kevin, just as Tod felt his stomach grumble, making him giggle a bit. Kevin reached for Tod's paw, only for Copper to lose his grip and let go, making the two fall and land on the ground. Tod fell on Kevin with his butt landing right onto Kevin's face, releasing a squeaky five second rotten egg fart in the process (pfffffffffft). He looked under and saw Kevin, blushing as he laughed and helped him up. \"Sorry dude. Copper's not all that strong yet and I had a really big breakfast.\" \"Eh, it's cool;\" Kevin said as he gagged beforehand, laughing a bit after. \"It's the tuba ones you gotta watch out for, so keep your butt away then.\" Tod gave a playful salute to Kevin. \"Mission, received.\" Tod and Kevin laughed as they walked back over to the ladder, with Copper sighing of relief, glad that the two of them were okay. Scene cuts to Tod and Kevin putting two helmets on Copper, one being on his head, and one tied to his butt. \"There. Now you can protect BOTH ends;\" Tod said with a carefree smile. \"Still, why would you need a butt helmet?\" \"Well how would I sit if I fell on it?\" Copper asked, making Tod and Kevin think for a bit. \"That's a good question actually;\" Tod admitted. \"But (puts fist on palm) No matter. We got a randon house place to finish.\" Copper and Kevin nodded as the three of them went back to their stations. Tod and Kevin pulled the wall back up and drilled in some screws on each end. Copper finished hammering in his wood, backing up and revealing that he made a statue of Kevin that was made out of wood. Tod and Kevin walked over and took a liking to the statue. \"That's some pretty handy work there Copper. Where'd you learn to make stuff like that?\" \"It's just something I did in the meantime while I was bored;\" Copper said with a happy go lucky attitude. \"I took it up one day when I went into town with Chief, and it became a hobby of mine ever since.\" Kevin looked at the statue and found it accurate to his design, smiling with gratitude. \"You sure did a great job dude. If I had a scar then this'd scare so many bears.\" Tod and Copper laughed at Kevin's words and the three continued to work. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper on the second floor, getting it ready for more room. Tod hammered in a final nail and got the last piece of wood to stay still. He wiped his forehead after and then turned to Copper, who had finished his end as well. \"Looks good to me Copper. Now we just need the wall.\" Copper looked around the area and then looked down, hoping there was enough wood. \"You think we'll have enough wood for it?\" \"Of course. Why wouldn't we?\" Tod asked and then he and Copper slid down to the first floor, where Kevin was seen painting the walls. He then saw the two as they went to get more wood. Tod and Copper grab some wood and Tod hits Copper's helmet playfully when laughing innocently. \"See? I told you we'd have enough.\" Tod and Copper went back up the ladder, heading up to the second floor. Kevin put the finishing touches on the wall he was painting and then backed up to look at it. Naruto and Sasuke were shown on the wall, colliding their Rasengan and Chidori from the series finale of the original. He smiled at the painting, knowing he was gonna have a ton of fun in his new home. He then looked up and Tod and Copper were seen setting up the first piece of wood for the wall, setting it up just right as Tod drilled in the nail to hold it up. Kevin smiled, grateful for what Tod and Copper were doing for him. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin in Jake's car as Jake was driving them somewhere. Jake stopped the car in front of the hardware store and gave Tod a watch, which he put on and high fived Jake after. \"Call me when you're done.\" Tod nodded and opened his door, hopping out of the car with Copper and Kevin. The trio then ran into the store and Jake saw an arcade, hoping to get a good time at it. \"Might as well enjoy myself. Tod, Copper, and Kevin ran into the store, looking around for anything useful for Kevin's tree home. Tod saw a cable wiring system, knowing that Kevin would need some electricity and then he turned to Copper and Kevin. \"Alright dudes. Now we'll all find out own things to get for the tree home, so find something you think would fit and bring it back at this spot afterwards.\" \"You got it Tod;\" Copper said with a nod. \"No problem;\" Kevin said, and then the trio took off. Tod ran into the section where he saw the cable wiring system, picking it up and walking off with it. He found it rather challenging to carry, and then he saw an unused hardware carrier and set the system on it. He then turned it around and raced through the store, seeming to have fun on it, putting his paws up into the air. \"Yahoo!\" Tod saw some really cool couches and stepped off of the carrier, skidding with his feet and stopping to a halt. He then walked over to the couches, wondering which one would work best for Kevin. After looking for a bit, he saw one of those couches that has a fridge to come with it, which he took to his liking. \"Jackpot.\" Copper was walking around the dining area, seeming interested in the things that he was seeing. He arrived at the countertops and saw that Kevin could use some. Looking for the most unique one, he saw a wooden one and thought it'd be fitting. He then started to climb up the shelves and walked up the countertop, trying to push it down. He managed to do so, but then fell off and hit the countertop, landing smack on his butt. He rubbed his butt with a whine, wishing he had a butt helmet. Kevin was seen in the electronics isle and saw a giant flat screen TV, feeling that he had to have it. He grabbed the tv and pulled it off, dragging it across the floor. The TV made a screeching noise as Kevin pulled it, catching the attention of the shoppers. Just then, Kevin was forced to stop pushing, as he looked up to see an employee. The employee gave a blank face to Kevin, who smiled sheepishly. Kevin went flying into a counter on a cart with the TV, sliding down to the floor with a blank look on his face. The young wolf had only one word to say in a frustrated tone. \"Jerk.\" The employee walked off with a smug smile on his face, only for his manager to appear before him. The manager spoke in a firm tone, signaling the employee to come with him. The employee glared at Kevin, who scoffed. \"Hey dude! You, attacked me!\" Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin meeting back where they came with the stuff they got. Tod, Copper, and Kevin put their stuff together and Tod looked at it. \"Okay, I think we did some good work. Black fridge, flat screen TV, wooden countertops, cable wiring system, and what looks like a bunk bed set.\" \"I like my height Tod;\" Kevin said in a carefree tone. \"Especially in my sleep.\" Copper looked at the box and loved how comfortable the bed looked, wanting to get one himself while wagging his tail. \"If I could sleep in the house then this is the exact bed I'd want.\" Copper then turned to Tod. \"That said, let's get back to the tree home. Tod nodded and walked off with Copper and Kevin, turning to the audience as they left the hardware store. \"If you're wondering, then yes. This was super hard. But was it enjoyable? Yeah, with Copper and Kevin helping me out. Things are always more fun with your friends, and this is one of those cases where you'd really need it.\" Tod hopped onto the cart and pulled Copper up, letting Kevin join in too. \"This is another case.\" Tod set the cart to full force and Copper hid in between the fridge and the bunk bed set. \"Alright dudes! Once we find Jake, it's time to finish Kevin's home!\" Tod, Copper, and Kevin went through the parking lot at full speed. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin at a burger place, talking about their lives. Tod was seen talking about the time he had the other week. \"So then we all ended up hiding behind a wall to escape the robots, and we barely escaped. It was then and there I could talk with my siblings.\" Kevin seemed to be invested in the story. \"It was pretty intense, but it seemed to die down once we got back to my place.\" Copper smacked down on his burger, letting out a small burp afterwards and covering his mouth. \"Scuse me.\" Kevin rolled his eyes upon Copper's politeness, smiling as he looked at Tod. \"Ya know Tod, you're pretty fun. You and Copper both.\" Tod and Copper smiled at Kevin's words, becoming worried when Kevin looked into his soda with sadness. \"I just wish I had more friends.\" \"What do you mean?\" Copper asked, seeming worried that Kevin had a dark past. \"Back at my old home, we never had many kids my age;\" Kevin said in a sorrow tone. \"The ones that WERE around always picked on me for how different I was from them.\" Kevin then looked back up. \"See, back at my old home, most of the creatures there were dogs, and I was an adopted wolf after my mom died, and my dad left us. I never met my dad, and I missed my mom a great deal. But I kept losing hope whenever those kids bullied me.\" Tod and Copper started to feel bad for Kevin, scooting over to him and putting one paw each on his shoulders. \"Just know that we'll never treat you the same way they did.\" Kevin looked up and scoffed, smiling at Tod and Copper's softness. \"You two really are softies, ya know that. Tod and Copper laughed a bit as Kevin looked at the both one at a time, feeling warmer upon the company of them. Scene cuts to Kevin setting the bunk bed set next to the wall he painted Naruto and Sasuke on. Kevin finished the bunk bed and climbed up to the top bunk, relaxing himself as Tod and Copper walked over. The two of them looked around the place, proud of all the work they did and high fived each other. Kevin then saw Tod and Copper and sat up on his bed, sitting on the edge. \"Gotta say dudes. I almost thought we wouldn't get this right. I mean after all, we're a seven year old fox, bloodhound, and wolf, so it wouldn't make too much sense in the real world for us to build things.\" \"Well we're lucky this isn't the real world Kevin;\" Tod said in a free spirited tone, sitting on the bottom bunk \"Sure the world we currently live in is real to us, but not to the viewers. And there's a lot of other stuff the real world doesn't have too.\" Copper sat down on the bottom bunk, lying down on it innocently. \"So this is what a bed feels like.\" Copper took a liking to the bed, not wanting to get off. Tod looked at Copper's face, as did Kevin when he looked down, revealing a relaxed look. The two friends giggled and Tod hopped down, allowing Copper to live his dream. \"I'm gonna go get us some snacks;\" Tod said, feeling hungry. \"Make sure Copper doesn't nail himself to the bed.\" Kevin laughed softly and gave a thumbs up as Tod walked into the kitchen, pulling out some sodas and closing the door. He then walked over to the pantry and opened it up, pulling out some cookies and Ritz crackers, as well as some cheese with five different flavors. He also pulled out a plate and put the snacks on it, seeing that he'd need more. So he got two other plates and put them on their own plates, smacking his lips at the look of them. He then got an idea as he put the food on each plate. \"You almost done in there Tod!?\" Kevin called to Tod from the other room. \"Almost!\" Tod called back with optomism. \"And I have another idea too!\" Tod grabbed the food and walked back over to the Copper and Kevin. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin in the living room with Kevin playing his Xbox. Kevin was shown to be playing Sonic and all stars racing transformed, seeming to be playing a rather challenging race. Tod seemed to be fascinated by the skills Kevin used, surprised that he had them at such a low level of knowledge. Copper was seen eating a bunch of Ritz cracker sandwiches that Tod made them. Kevin managed to finish in first place, throwing his controller on the soft couch and going into two leg mode to cheer. \"Yes! Kevin la awesome wolf wins again!\" Kevin laughed as he lied down on the couch with Tod getting another idea in his head. He turned to Kevin, who'd just sat back up. \"Hey Kevin. I was thinking.\" \"Yeah, go ahead dude;\" Kevin said while playing his game. \"Your sleepover idea was good.\" \"That's why I came up with it;\" Tod replied, and then he got to the point. \"Anyway, I was wondering if you'd like to be the third member of our group. (Kevin becomes surprised to hear this and Copper takes a liking to the idea.) You don't seem to have any friends aside from, maybe us, and I figured you could use someone to hang out with too. And as much as I love hangin with Copper, it'd get pretty boring with just us.\" Kevin smiled at the idea and hugged Tod with greatness, making Tod smile as well. \"I'll take that as a yes. (The game shows that Kevin's falling behind.) Dude, you're losing your game.\" \"I don't care.\" Kevin said, so overjoyed by Tod's offer that he didn't care about playing then. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin getting ready for bed, with Tod sleeping on the floor. \"I should warn you dudes;\" Kevin snickered. \"I'm a sleep farter.\" \"No problem to me Kev.\" Tod said in a caring way as he set his sleeping bag up. Copper looked at what Tod was doing, surprised to see him going to sleep on the floor. \"You know there's a couch, right? Why're you sleeping there?\" \"I guess I'd just prefer to stay closer to you guys;\" Tod said as he got into his sleeping bag. \"You feel comforting to be around, being my friends and all.\" Copper and Kevin smiled at Tod's comment, with Tod smiling back at them. The three of them went to bed as Kevin felt at home with his new friends. Forty minutes later. Kevin cut a three second moldy cheese fart (phhhhht). Tod and Copper smelt the fart and covered their noses upon the scent, just as Kevin let loose a five second chocolate cookie fart (bllllllllllaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrp). Kevin then cut three machine gun farts that reeked of pepper jack cheese (pfft) (brup) (phht). Tod sighed and got up as he walked over to a window, just as Kevin cut a wet tuba three second wolf poop fart (phhhhht). Tod opened the window and sighed of relief as the foul oders had left the room, walking back over to his sleeping bag and going in. He looked up to Kevin and smiled, going to sleep afterwards. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper leaving in the morning, bidding their goodbye for nows to Kevin. \"So we'll be on our way now Kevin;\" Tod said with optomsim, pointing to the phone Kevin was holding. \"Make sure to use that when you can.\" Kevin nodded and hugged Tod and Copper, grateful for the help they gave him. \"Stay fresh dudes.\" Tod and Copper nodded as Kevin let them go, sliding down the ladder and running off afterwards as Tod turned to the audience. \"So Kevin's really not as big of a jerk as we thought at first. He just needed some friends. Also, don't expect this to one hundred percent work. This is our moral. And we do it how we can.\" Copper looked at Tod with a somewhat confused look ,with Tod brushing it off as they ran ahead. They then started playing tag together, never getting to finish he game they started yesterday. The two of them laughed playfully as they ran home during their game. They also felt joy over befriending Kevin as the screen faded to black, ending the episode off. Light guitar music plays during the credits as Tod is seen walking through the forest. A female voice prepared to sing My mother as Tod looked at the ground in a sorrow mood once the song began, showing Tod's struggle with his mother's death and his new life. \"As much as I love my life there are truth's that I can't deny.\" Tod passed over some shadows of Signal and his minions confronting him. \"If I hadn't seen my mother die then time could just fly by.\" Tod then had a vision of Signal attemtping to kill him, sending fear down his spine. \"But even with all of this in mind and all of this known pain.\" Tod tried to shake off the memory, not letting it get to him. \"If I just let it affect me then there's nothing to gain.\" Copper was seen walking through the forest with a rather upset look on his face, struggling to find who he was as the song continued from another female singer. \"And even with these thoughts in mind and all that I can see.\" Copper looked up to the sky, having images of Chief teaching him how to hunt. \"Deep down inside my heart I just don't know what I want to be.\" Copper looked at the rabbit doll in the clouds above, not wanting to hurt it. \"I know they're trying to help me but I don't want this life.\" Copper looked on ahead with confusion in his eyes. \"And although I'm grateful for their support inside I have this strife.\" Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest together, both confused as the song continued with both female singers. \"Both of these memories from within show how we struggle with our lives.\" Tod arrived at a hill as he looked over it, holding back his tears of pain. \"The loss of grief and choice of life just show how which one of us survives.\" Tod looked to see Copper next to him, both having similar pain. \"But even with this thought inside me I won't let it be a bother.\" Tod smiled and scooted closer to Copper, wrapping his arm around him. \"Cause us best friends won't ever want or try to hurt each other.\" Copper smiled upon the comfort of Tod, both of them looking over the hill as these last lyrics were sung, as well as them appearing on the screen from the first singer. \"I will get the proudness deserved from and by my mother.\"[Chapter 4] The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy Season one Episode four: A fox's school Anime rock music played during the credits as the song Prophecy was heard while a male singer was heard. Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest as a male started singing. \"This is the power of my friends, and family with it.\" Tod and Copper jumped into a pond and started splashing one another along with a wolf cub. \"Even if it's not all that simple and has hard stuff to fit.\" Terra was seen at the top of a tree as she jumped from the highest branch. \"I know there's more to me than being a simple kid.\" Terra cannonballed into the pond, splashing Tyler, who was seen tuning his guitar. \"But for my siblings life, that's nothing that I'd bid.\" Tyler jumped into the pool and Vixey popped up next to Tod, making the fox kit blush and smile while rubbing his arm. \"It's complicated, but I don't care. My life may just flash like a flare.\" Tod and the others were seen punching, kicking, and biting Signal's minions. \"But as long as you're here I could care less!\" Jake was seen slashing the robots in half with a sword. \"Even if I die today!\" Signal's eyes were shown with a dark glow. \"It'll be a noble decay!\" Tod and Signal were seen punching and kicking one another in the air. \"My family's not something I'd give up so easily!\" Tod shot a bullet at Signal, who deflected it right back at Tod and his him in the knee. \"My friends and family, are important to me!\" Tod sneered at Signal and managed to charge at her. \"And I will find the truth in the prophecy!\" Tod glowed a bright red color and then he aimed a punch at Signal upon the final lyrics. \"That's right, I will find the truth in the prophecy.\" Tod and the others were seen going onto the title screen, with Tod front flipping onto the screen next to Copper, being adventurous and optimistic, Copper being kind and timid, Terra skateboarding onto the screen with tsundere feistiness and playfulness, Tyler tuning his guitar and giving a peace sign to the audience with care and calmness, the wolf kicking down the door and flipping off the audience, showing his cocky and selfish side, Vixey showing her bookworm and researcher side when walking on screen, and Jake slashing through the wall and jumping on with the others, and then The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy appeared behind them. Scene cuts to Tod playing video games in his room as he nears the end of a level. Tod seemed to be invested in his game, with the windows closed and the air conditioner on. He was so invested in fact, that it was the only thing he could focus on; not even noticing that someone was knocking on his door. Jake then opened the door and spoke up. \"Tod, you awake?\" Tod didn't respond, making Jake realize that the fox was in one of his game zones. \"Oh. (Laughs a bit) Right.\" Jake walked over to Tod and grabbed the controller from his paws, upsetting him. \"Jake, you didn't let me save.\" Tod whined, annoyed at his game being interrupted. \"I'm gonna have to restart now.\" \"Sorry little dude. You got school today.\" Jake paused the game and saved it for Tod, handing the controller back to him. He then left the room, just as Tod hopped off of his bed and picked up his school stuff. Tod turned to the audience and spoke in an annoyed tone. \"I'm sure you've all been in the situation I'm in at least once; where you're invested as heck into something and then you have to stop to do something else. Well it's really annoying, and we all know it.\" Tod opened up his backpack and pulled out a portable console. \"That's why I have the Foxdrive 420. It's like the Ds in the real world, only it doesn't have the exact games; duh.\" Tod put his game away and let out a sigh. \"If I could hide it from my teachers then I would. Don't get me wrong; I love my school, especially now that Copper and Kevin go there. But that's mostly for the food and social stuff.\" Tod finished packing his school supplies and walked off, finishing his talk with the audience. \"And yeah, Terra and Tyler are in my school now too. I could see at least one of us joining an after school club. Maybe all of us.\" Tod jumped up onto the handrail and slid down it. Scene cuts to Tod closing his locker at school while talking to Copper, who's locker was next to his. \"I'm tellin you Copper; it should be illegal for them to not allow video games into school.\" Tod seemed annoyed at the fact that some placed didn't allow video games. \"If I was a president then I'd never ban them.\" \"It's obvious why they ban them Tod.\" Copper said with kindness in his voice. \"They think they're a waste of time and want them to be burned. But that's also not true.\" Copper then blew a whistle and loads of students stacked up in the hallway, surprising Tod. \"Which is why I arranged this.\" Tod walked up to the platforms and became worried upon seeing them as Copper walked over to him. \"Are you sure this is safe Copper? And we gotta get to third soon.\" \"Not at all.\" Copper said with pride. \"But few platformers are like that all the way to begin with.\" Tod let out a chuckle. \"Yeah, good point. Just don't expect me to win straight away.\" Copper nodded as he then watched Tod do the course, with crashing being heard after about five seconds; making the Bloodhound close his eyes. He then opened one in hopes that Tod made it out okay, walking over to him and pulling him out. \"You okay buddy?\" \"I twisted an arm, but I'll be fine.\" Tod said with optimism as he then relocated his arm. \"Ow.\" Scene cuts to Tod and Copper walking around the school, thinking of something to do. \"It has to be something fresh.\" Tod said while brainstorming, trying to think of something he could do. \"Something unique; inivative; entertaining. Something I can call a hobby.\" Video game sounds were heard from another room, leading to Tod and Copper walking up to a door. The two of them looked inside, seeing a bunch of people playing video games or recording stuff on cameras. Tod seemed intrigued and knocked on the door, with the leader, a female Golden Retriever answering with a high spirited and fun loving tone. \"Can I help you?\" \"Yeah, I've heard that line in a snarky sense before.\" Tod implied, shooting back to when he met Chief. \"For reals though, I heard video game sounds in there, and I was wondering what was up.\" \"Oh, thaaaat.\" The leader looked back inside and then back at Tod and Copper, pulling them inside and closing the door. \"This, is our lounge. We sometimes record a bunch of stuff and take pictures for the yearbook, but we also play video games to pass the time.\" Tod became even more intrigued upon what the room offered. \"So you guys can get away with playing video games all you want?\" \"In a sense, yeah.\" The leader then shook both Tod and Copper's paws. \"My name's Stacey by the way, and I'll be sure to fill you in on what we do after school. Our positions are almost full, but I'll save the last two slots for you.\" \"You have save files for us?\" Copper asked with excitement. \"No Copper. She means the spots open for the club.\" Tod explained, with Copper getting a reassured look. \"Oh.\" Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Stacey at the gym after school, with Stacey demonstrating what the club does. \"This is the perfect timing to show you guys how we do this.\" Stacey began with enthusiasm. \"Right now I'm recording a basketball game happening in here, and Terra's team is making the win.\" \"Hey; Terra's my sister's name.\" Tod said with excitement as Tod saw Terra playing and started watching her. \"I told you one of us would join a club Copper.\" \"Might be two after this one.\" Copper started to watch Terra as Stacey continued explaining the camera stuff. \"So right now I need you guys to pay attention, since we don't just play video games in the club.\" Stacey explained. \"Sure for the most part we goof around, but when the time comes, we have to be serious about everything and stand up for everyone.\" Tod remembered that he's the one Signal's after, turning to Stacey with confidence. \"Got it.\" \"Alright then. Let's do this.\" Stacey started recording the game again and Terra got sent flying back with a basketball, crashing against the wall and sliding down it. Terra then saw that Stacey caught the whole thing on camera, instantly showing her cold and demanding side. \"You'd better erase that.\" \"Don't worry Terra. I'd never post anything without your approval.\" Stacey finished recording and signaled Tod and Copper to head out. Tod and Copper nodded and walked off with Tod bidding Terra a see ya later. However you do that. \"Later Terra.\" \"See you at home Tod.\" Terra ran back out onto the field and shouted to her players. \"Cmon people! Let's pound some face!\" Stacey continued to explain the steps of recording. \"Now there are many jobs you could get for recording. A reporter, a comedian, or even the President. (Looks at Tod and Copper.) People would be recording you then of course.\" Tod and Copper nodded in understanding with Tod taking an interest in this recording stuff. \"Can I have a private camera?\" Scene cuts to Stacey talking to Tod and Copper in her office about them joining the fliming club. \"Now I need you two to promise me one thing, and one thing only.\" Stacey held her paws out and looked at Tod and Copper sternly, but with a smile. \"Never break the unspoken rule. Which is our only rule, and so obvious that I don't even have to mention it.\" Tod and Copper nodded in agreement and shook Stacey's paws, allowing Stacey to give them their cameras. \"Thank you for agreeing to the necessary requirements, And here are your cameras.\" \"Nice.\" Tod turned on his camera and started filming Stacey. \"This is gonna take talking to the audience to a whole new level.\" \"So now I can record Kevin sleep farting?\" Copper asked with excitement, making Tod laugh a bit. \"As long as you don't upload it without his permission, yeah.\" Stacey then pulled up a flier for a contest, believing Tod and Copper would like it. \"There's also this contest we're having to show off the funniest videos. Why, I guess to make people laugh.\" Tod looked at the flier and became intrigued as he turned to the audience. \"Cha-ching.\" Tod's eyes turned back to normal as he spoke with optimism. \"You guys wanna see something that holds the plot together then you're gonna get it. (Looks at Copper) Cmon Copper; we got a film thing to make.\" Copper nodded as he ran off with Tod, both of them being excited for the contest. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper in Tod's living room thinking of videos they could make for the contest. \"Okay. So we need something huge, mind blowing, and epic for the video contest.\" Tod thought over some stuff they could do. \"Maybe we could do some parkour.\" \"What's parkour?\" Copper asked, being unfamiliar with the event. \"It's like that platforming thing you did, only it's not promising any falls.\" Tod explained. \"Think of it as a run but don't stop arcade game.\" Copper nodded in understanding and then thought over some videos himself. \"What if we could flaming hoops into the video?\" Tod took a liking to the idea and nodded. \"Sounds good to me. And maybe even a giant barrel with pickles in it.\" Tod thought about pickles for a moment, wanting to eat one now. \"Great. Now I'm thinkin about pickles.\" Tod and Copper tried to think of some other stuff they could add as they walked over to the fridge. As Tod grabbed a soda, Copper suggested something. \"Maybe we could find a ramp for a skateboarding section.\" Tod thought for a moment and took a liking to the idea. \"I like it. Let's go ask Jake.\" Copper nodded and ran off with Tod, both being excited. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper walking up to Jake's room while he's on his computer. Tod nodded to Copper and the two of them headed up to Jake; with Tod doing the talking. \"Jake, we have a request.\" Jake turned his chair around and Tod handed him a paper. \"As you can clearly see, this list has all of the items we need for our parkour video, and we need either you to buy them, or you to drive us to a place to buy them ourselves. Either one is fine.\" Jake looked down at Tod's bubbly smile and Copper's innocent air-headed grin, laughing a bit as he set the paper down on his desk. \"Sorry little dudes. Those don't work on me, even in duo doses.\" Jake walked off, leaving Copper worried about the scenario. \"What do we do now Tod? Those items aren't gonna buy themselves.\" \"Don't worry Copper. I have a plan.\" Tod assured his best friend, heading off to pursuade Jake. Jake walked downstairs to find Tod standing at the big step above the two steps at the bottom, seeming to be begging with his usual bubbly and optimistic self. \"Please please please please please please please?\" Jake walked past Tod and headed for the kitchen, only to have his foot held by something. Upon looking down, Jake saw Tod holding his arm with his paws as he tried to walk. \"Please please please please please please please?\" Jake took his foot away from Tod's paws and walked over to the fridge, opening it, only for Tod to peek out from it and startle him. \"Please!?\" \"Tod, I'm gonna have to call you repeater if you keep this up.\" Jake grabbed himself a soda and opened it. \"I can't just buy you all this stuff straight away dude. I'm not rich.\" Jake walked off, only for Tod to appear in front of him. \"How about now?\" Jake rolled his eyes as Tod continued his adorable grin. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper watching Tv while being bored out of their minds. \"Any ideas on a video?\" Tod asked, with Copper nodding his head no. \"Any idea on why we changed plans on working without context in scenes?\" Copper nodded his head no, and Tod let out an agrivated sigh. \"There has to be something we can do. Something huge, and action packed.\" Tod and Copper then saw Terra walking by, drinking a soda with frustration. The young female fox then saw her older brother and his Bloodhound friend looking at her, glaring at them with seething anger in her voice. \"What?\" Tod and Copper stood still and Terra walked off as she drank her soda again. Tod then got inspiration for his video. \"I think we just found our gig.\" Scene cuts to Tod knocking on Terra's door, with Terra opening it up. \"Yeah Tod?\" \"Just wanted to know if we could come into your room and record stuff.\" Tod requested, showing Terra her camera. \"I'm in the filming club now.\" Terra rolled her eyes in annoyance. \"Fine. Make it quick.\" Tod and Copper entered the room with Terra closing the door. \"Yeah, it's pretty hard to live in an attic with Tyler. So many boring rules and so much meditation.\" Tod smelt the air and sniffed for a bit, getting a foul oder. \"Bleh. Does meditation mean moldy onions?\" \"Oh, no, those are mine.\" Terra admitted with proudness. \"See, that'a nother thing he complains about; me doing that in my sleep.\" Copper gagged a bit at the scent and saw Terra's basketball, picking it up and looking at it. He then bounced it for a bit, finding an interest in it. \"This red ball is pretty fun Terra.\" Terra zipped over to Copper as soon as she saw him with her basketball. \"That's a basketball Copper, and I (Takes the basketball back) didn't say you could touch it.\" Tod found a clip that interested him and saw no title to it, seeing some slides of Terra with cake on her face. Taking an interest in the video, he looked at his little sister. \"Hey Terra; can I add this to the video?\" \"I don't care.\" Terra stated bluntly, with Tod putting the slide away and smiling. \"Now get over here so we can check out the time I punched Tyler in the face for waking me up last night.\" Tod chuckled a bit and walked over to Terra and Copper. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper checking out the slide on Tod's computer. \"Alright dude. Let's check this out.\" Tod started the video and Terra was seen at a birthday party. Terra was seen having her cake brought up to her with a clown tripping and dropping it on her. The clown played it off as a joke, only for Terra to become enraged and tackle him. Terra started punching the clown in the face as the clown sprayed water on her. That only got her more infuriated, as she then started choking the clown. \"Give me one good reason not to stick a pole up your butt!\" Tod and Copper continued watching the video until Terry turned to the camera and chuckles. \"That's my vixen.\" Terry turned off the video, with Copper questioning who he was. \"Who was that?\" \"I think that was Terry.\" Tod concluded. \"He seems like the light hearted goofball Terra described him as.\" Tod thought for a moment and added the video to his footage. \"Let's hope this works.\" Scene cuts to Terra arriving at basketball practice the next day, while noticing her teammates laughing at something. Terra walked over to her teammates with a smile, wondering what they were looking at. She then became shocked when she saw the same video Tod and Copper were watching. Furious, she grabbed the teammate who's phone it was; which just so happened to be a female husky. \"Where did you get this?\" \"It was a part of that filming contest thing.\" The husky confessed. \"I swear I had nothing to do with it; I just saw that it won first prize and decided to watch it.\" Terra looked at the video again and face palmed herself in frustration. \"I'm going to kill Tod when I get home. With my paws.\" The basketball team leader, a male German Shepherd, grabbed Terra's shoulders and turned her to him with calmness. \"Chill out Terra. Let's just get to the game and drop this for now.\" \"Except that video's a huge part of my humiliation.\" Terra admited, hating the memory. \"The only reason I kept it is because...I just did, okay!?\" \"Alright; let's just get to the game.\" The German Shepherd stated with optimism. \"We five year old foxens are gonna rule the tournament when it comes up.\" Terra's teammates walked out onto the field, with Terra wlaking after them; still mad about the video. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper arriving home after their club day was fullfilled, talking about the great time they had. Tod looked at his camera and seemed to take a liking to the shine of it, seeing it as something worthy of doing in his free time. \"Let me tell you Copper; this film stuff is a lot funner than I figured it'd be. I'm honestly surprised I got all of this information.\" Tod turned his camera on and started recording Copper. \"Do tell my canine best friend. What's YOUR opinion on the activity?\" Copper smiled as he saw the camera, playing along with Tod's imaginary intervention. \"It really did surprise me. It's something I have a lot of fun doing.\" Tod turned the camera off and looked at the footage, with Copper being worried about Terra. \"So how do you think Terra'll react to that video we posted of her?\" \"Relax Copper; she said we could post it.\" Tod reminded Copper, with him then showing him the box. \"And she got a clean look at the case, so if she doesn't want us to show it anymore then we'll smash it.\" \"Yeah, but what if she gets upset over it?\" Copper asked. \"I mean not that I would, but it's possible. Terra has a pretty bad temper.\" \"Can you believe this guy?\" Tod asked as he turned to the audience, looking at his friend afterwards. \"I doubt someone would hate their own brother when they did something they said they could do.\" \"Yeah, I guess.\" Copper then worried for Terra. \"I just hope she's not mad.\" \"Don't worry dude. Terra will never know.\" Tod seemed a bit over-confident in what could happen, which was then shown to be right; with Terra glaring at him as soon as he opened the door. Tod and Copper gulped, instantly knowing what was going on. \"She knows.\" \"You're darn right I know.\" Terra said as she walked up to Tod and Copper with rage. \"What the heck is wrong with you guys? Now the school will eventually see me as a freak.\" \"What do you mean?\" Tod asked with confusion. \"That video's one of my most aggressive times on the film.\" Terra explained. \"I'm fine with people knowing how brutal I can be, but not to the point of them thinking I'll floor them and torture them.\" Tod and Copper looked at each other and then back at Terra, with Tod trying to reason with her. \"If in any timeline where you were totally okay with this, and you didn't get mad over it, as well as were totally calm and weren't-\" \"Then you'd be the aggressive one.\" \"That's what I thought.\" \"In Tod's defense Terra, we got a bunch of money from the contest.\" Copper pointed out, with Terra giving a blunt look. \"That fixes everything.\" Terra clearly spoke with sarcasm, with her then groaning and finishing with anger. \"You dolts made me look like I worship Signal!\" Terra walked off as Tod walked after her, with her turning around and stopping him. \"And fyi, you're so lucky the basketball team let me stay.\" Terra walked off and Copper walked up to Tod, patting him on the back. \"It'll fly by Tod. Siblings get mad at each other; it'll blow over.\" Tod looked at his camera and then had another flashforward of Terra doubting herself in the battle against Signal. As Terra walked off, Tod started to feel sad. Alone. Worthless. The stuff he was feeling made him feel like a horrible brother; even if he didn't entirely disobey Terra. As the flashforward ended, Tod gave his camera to Copper with a determined look to not have Terra hate him. \"I can't have my sister doubt herself.\" Scene cuts to Tod looking up some stuff online as he then looked at some sports stuff. While looking through some stuff for Terra, he then saw what looked like a blue basketball. Tod seemed hopeful as Copper then became confused when he clicked on it. \"Why're we clicking on this Tod? Looks like a normal basketball.\" \"It is; but it's from Terra's favorite basketball team.\" Tod explained. \"Soaring Foxes I think it was. Seems like a pretty interesting team.\" Tod went to see the price and found it to be at least sixty something dollars. Looking at his wallet on his desk, he opened it up and looked into it; seeing as he barely had enough. \"Three dollars over the price.\" \"Should we do it?\" Copper asked with concern. \"What about those video games you've been saving up for.\" Terra was seen having her ear up to the door, seeming interested in what Tod and Copper were doing. \"I don't care about that anymore. Video games aren't worth my sister hating me.\" Terra seemed touched by what Tod was saying, trying to think of something to do for him. As she ran up to her room, she hopped onto her own laptop on her bed; looking something up with a positive look. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper arriving home with Stacey, who hops out of Jake's car with them with her camera in her paws. \"Thanks for letting me film this guys.\" Stacey said with excitement as they arrived at the door. \"I never imagined our unspoken rule could be followed incorrectly.\" \"Neither could I, but it happened.\" Tod said as Jake then opened the door, with Terra sitting on the couch in the living room. Jake then kneeled down to Tod. \"I'll let you two talk it out yourselves.\" Tod nodded as Jake headed off, with Tod walking over to Terra with Copper and Stacey. As Tod sat down next to Terra, he then looked at her. \"Look Terra. About the video.\" \"I overheard what you did yesterday.\" Tod became surprised by Terra's words; only to become more surprised when Terra pulled up a video game set. \"I also heard about the video games you wanted, and since you were getting me that basketball from the Soaring Foxes, I figured it'd feel right.\" Tod looked at the game collection and saw it to be Sonic the Hedgehog, Mario, Dead Rising, Pokemon, and a lot of other games. \"It costed at least five hundred dollars, but that's nothing considering that my team won the last championship.\" Tod smiled and opened his backpack instantly, pulling out the basketball and giving it to Terra; who snarked playfully a bit. \"What is this, secret santa?\" Copper then became excited and jumped on the couch. \"We're having secret santa in march?\" Tod rolled his eyes while smiling and wrapped his arm round Copper's head, making Copper smile and wag his tail. \"Guys, if this was after some intense moment with a super villain, I'd be crying.\" Stacey stopped recording and set her camera down, looking at Tod with compassion. \"You sure do care about your siblings Tod.\" \"Of course I do; who wouldn't?\" Tod asked, with Stacey jumping up to them and sitting with them; as Terra then spun her new ball on her finger. As Terra spun the ball, she looked at Tod with a smile. \"I guess you're not the worst brother in the universe. At least you're not boring like Tyler.\" Tod chuckled as he then hugged Terra, who set the basketball down behind her. Scene cuts to Tod putting his video game collection on his desk, relieved at how everything turned out. As he then turned to Copper, who was sitting next to him, he spoke with kindness. \"I gotta hand it to the world Copper. Today it gave me a new hobby, and now Terra has a new basketball, I have a bunch of new video games, and everyone's happy.\" Tod then thought about Terry. \"I wonder if Terry thinks about Terra; wherever he is.\" \"He's only been gone for about a couple weeks.\" Copper stated with confidence, and he then looked at Tod's video games; picking one up with confusion. \"What I wanna know is how these can work on consoles that don't exist in the real world.\" \"Oh, the creator just slapped the console name on them and they work now.\" Copper shrugged and put them back as Tod turned to the audience. \"And I'm not lying either. This film stuff is a lot of fun. I learned more about Terra, (Gains a worried look) mainly that she can be dangerous, (Smiles) and now I have a bunch of new video games, and she has a new basketball. (Conflicted) I just hope that flash forward didn't mean too much.\" \"Flash forward?\" Tod looked and saw a confused Copper, with him giggling a bit. \"I don't think now's a good time to tell you Copper. Let's wait until the next story driven chapter; (Turns to the audience) which don't worry, we plan to have be next time.\" \"Okay then.\" Copper grabbed a controller and handed a second one to Tod. \"You wanna play some of your new games?\" \"Heck yeah! Let's post then to Youtube.\" Tod suggested, as he grabbed his camera and set it up on a standing post; turning it on as Copper turned on his game. \"Is it on?\" \"Yep.\" Tod jumped onto his bed with Copper jumping ont it next to him as the two friends started playing. Tod's game was shown to be Sonic and all stars racing transformed as the screen faded to black, ending the episode off. Light guitar music plays during the credits as Tod is seen walking through the forest. A female voice prepared to sing My mother as Tod looked at the ground in a sorrow mood once the song began, showing Tod's struggle with his mother's death and his new life. \"As much as I love my life there are truths that I can't deny.\" Tod passed over some shadows of Signal and her minions confronting him. \"If I hadn't seen my mother die then time could just fly by.\" Tod then saw a vision of Signal attempting to kill him, sending fear down his spine. \"But even with all of this in my mind and all of this known pain.\" Tod tried to shake off the memory, not letting it get to him. \"If I just let it affect me then there's nothing to gain.\" Copper was seen walking through the forest with a rather upset look on his face, struggling to find who he was as the song continued from another female singer. \"And even with these thoughts in mind and all that I can see.\" Copper looked up to the sky, having images of Chief teaching him how to hunt. \"Deep down inside my heart I just don't know what I want to be.\" Copper looked at the rabbit doll in the clouds above, not wanting to hurt it. \"I know they're trying to help me but I don't want this life.\" Copper looked on ahead with confusion in his eyes. \"And although I'm grateful for their support inside I have this strife.\" Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest together, both confused as the song continued with both female singers. \"Both of these memories from within show how we struggle with our lives.\" Tod arrived at a hill as he looked over it, holding back his tears of pain. \"The loss of grief and choice of life show how which one of us survives.\" Tod looked to see Copper next to him, both having similar pain. \"But even with this thought inside me I won't let it be a bother.\" Tod smiled and scooted closer to Copper, wrapping his arm around him. \"Cause us best friends won't ever want to try to hurt each other.\" Copper smiled upon the comfort of Tod, both of them looking over the hill as these last lyrics were sung, as well as them appearing on the screen from the first singer. \"I will get the proudness deserved from and by my mother.\"[Chapter 5] The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy Season one Episode five: Fox Family History Anime rock music played during the credits as the song Prophecy was heard while a male singer was heard. Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest as a male started singing. \"This is the power of my friends, and family with it.\" Tod and Copper jumped into a pond and started splashing one another along with a wolf cub. \"Even if it's not all that simple and has hard stuff to fit.\" Terra was seen at the top of a tree as she jumped from the highest branch. \"I know there's more to me than being a simple kid.\" Terra cannonballed into the pond, splashing Tyler, who was seen tuning his guitar. \"But for my siblings life, that's nothing that I'd bid.\" Tyler jumped into the pool and Vixey popped up next to Tod, making the fox kit blush and smile while rubbing his arm. \"It's complicated, but I don't care. My life may just flash like a flare.\" Tod and the others were seen punching, kicking, and biting Signal's minions. \"But as long as you're here I could care less!\" Jake was seen slashing the robots in half with a sword. \"Even if I die today!\" Signal's eyes were shown with a dark glow. \"It'll be a noble decay!\" Tod and Signal were seen punching and kicking one another in the air. \"My family's not something I'd give up so easily!\" Tod shot a bullet at Signal, who deflected it right back at Tod and his him in the knee. \"My friends and family, are important to me!\" Tod sneered at Signal and managed to charge at her. \"And I will find the truth in the prophecy!\" Tod glowed a bright red color and then he aimed a punch at Signal upon the final lyrics. \"That's right, I will find the truth in the prophecy.\" Tod and the others were seen going onto the title screen, with Tod front flipping onto the screen next to Copper, being adventurous and optimistic, Copper being kind and timid, Terra skateboarding onto the screen with tsundere feistiness and playfulness, Tyler tuning his guitar and giving a peace sign to the audience with care and calmness, the wolf kicking down the door and flipping off the audience, showing his cocky and selfish side, Vixey showing her bookworm and researcher side when walking on screen, and Jake slashing through the wall and jumping on with the others, and then The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy appeared behind them. Scene cuts to Tod looking out his window in excitement, knowing that the day was going to be exciting. Tod jumped off of his bed and ran out of his room, running up to the attic. Just as he was about to knock however, he thought for a moment and nodded his head no with a smile; figuring that even his siblings would need sleep for a day like this. He instead slid down the handrail to the attic stairs and rushed over to the bathroom, grabbing his toothbrush and putting the toothpaste on it. However, one thing I should mention is that he was standing on a broken footstool, so you can imagine the difficulty he had while balancing on it. Tod turned to the audience as he explained why he was up so early. \"There's this awesome fair I heard about coming to town and I really wanna go to it. There's a lot of stuff from this epic tent and loads more. I think it'll be a plot point.\" Tod started to wobble on the footstool he was on, giglging a bit as he continued. \"There's also an acrobatic show from what I can remember.\" Jake was seen walking down the hallway as he heard a crash, which signaled him to walk to the bathroom; where he found Tod on the floor laughing with his toothbrush in his mouth. Jake assisted the young fox in getting up while Tod continued brushing. \"What's the rush Tod?\" \"That fair I've been waiting at least two weeks for is coming today.\" Tod explained with a somewhat muffled voice as he got back to looking in the mirror. \"You know; the one I told you about as soon as I saw it on Tv. It had that singing dog group and everything. Singing Strays I think they are.\" Jake did remember the fair Tod had just reminded him of, but didn't feel that the date was correct. He searched on his phone and found that Tod was at least a month off, giving Tod's bubbly nature a run for it's money. Tod may not be air-headed like Copper, but he was simple minded. \"Hate to break the bad news here dude, but the fair's taking at least twenty six days to come into town. (Tod stops brushing) Heck, maybe even a full month.\" \"Oh.\" Tod spit his toothpaste into the sink and washed his toothbrush, drinking some of the water and spitting it into the sink. Once he put his toothbrush back, he then dried off his face as he spoke. \"Well if that's the case then it's a good thing I didn't wake Terra and Tyler up.\" Tod set the towel down and looked at Jake. \"I was gonna take Terra with me and Tyler's the only one who can keep us from fighting the entire time.\" \"Ah.\" Jake looked at the footstool as Tod got off of it, looking at Tod afterwards with a smile. \"Tell ya what dude. Just so you don't have to have woken up for nothing, you're gonna help me with breakfast.\" \"Can I choose what we make?\" Tod asked as he jumped onto Jake's back with his usual bubbly smile. \"I don't care.\" Jake replied as he walked off. Scene cuts to Terra sleeping in her room as she then rolled out of her bed, which woke her up as she peeked up. \"Who was that?\" Terra asked, and then she looked to the right. \"Where are (Looks to the left) you?\" Terra pulled up her paw and let her claws come out, preparing for whatever was to come. Of course, Terra at this point is the clear runt of the family, but that doesn't mean she can't pack a punch; for she was both a tomboy, and a tsundere. As she walked around, the young vixen heard her stomach growl; which likely meant that she was hungry. 'Guess I should get some food.' Tyler was seen waking up as he rubbed his eye and spoke. \"Do you mind Terra? I'm trying to get some sleep.\" \"At eight thirty in the morning?\" Tyler went back to sleep with Terra getting an idea, with her walking up to Tyler's bed and hopping onto it; making sure not to wake him as she then put her butt up to his face. 'Good thing we four legged animals don't wear clothes.' She winked to the audience as her butt was then shown when she cut a three second protein shake fart (phhhhht). Tyler fell out of his bed and held his nose as Terra laughed at his reaction. Tyler wiped his nose and growled, glaring at Terra and pulling her off of his bed. \"Let's just go eat breakfast.\" Terra removed her arm from Tyler's grasp as she winked to her rear end and walked off with Tyler. Scene cuts to Tod chowing down on what looked like a pancake bacon sandwhich, seeming to be loving what he was eating. Tod and Terra both seemed to be loving their food with Tyler snickering as he saw them eating it. \"When Jake said you chose what you were making Tod, I didn't expect anything like this.\" \"Expect everything with me Tyler.\" Tod took another giant bite out of his food with him then letting out a burp; which Terra hi fived him for. Tyler then let out a yawn and face planted into his food, with Tod lifting his face up with a hint of sass in his voice. \"You look terrible.\" \"Ask Terra's butt if you want a full story.\" Tyler stated bluntly, with Tod looking at a snickering Terra. \"If mom was here she'd be in her room for at least two hours for that one.\" Tod seemed conflicted on who their mother was, not having much memory of her. \"Now that I think about it, the last I remember of our mom is when she died. I don't even think any of us remember our dad.\" \"I remember that he was some lame jerk who didn't do anything.\" Terra stated coldly as she then took her food and walked off. \"The least he could've done is at least TRY to help mom deliver us.\" Terra seemed to be taking this whole thing rather hard, with Tod getting up and hoping she was okay. He took his food with him just so you know. As Tod sat down next to Terra, he put his paw on her shoulder for comfort. \"You okay Terra?\" \"I guess.\" Terra replied. \"Just don't make me talk about it, okay?\" Tod nodded and picked up the remote, with Tyler sitting down next to Tod as the middle fox started surfing through the channels. Scene cuts to Vixey in her cave as she was seen reading a book about some kind of history. Vixey was shown to be invested in the book she was reading, seeming to have a fondness for what it was about. It was then shown that it was about the history of Tod's clan, which she then sighed upon reading. \"I so wish I could see these guys. (Closes her book) I can only imagine how cool it would be to walk up to the leader of this clan and just tell him how cool it is to meet him.\" Vixey hopped down with her book and put it away, making sure it was in alphabetical order. \"Ah well. At least I have the knowledge for them.\" Vixey walked off to her kitchen and opened up the fridge, pulling out a soda and opening it up. As she drank it though, she started thinking about Tod. She didn't know why though, as she'd only met him about a week or two ago. Ten days to be precise. Then she got a hunch. It must've been the book she was reading. After all, it WAS about the clan Tod was born in. She ran over to her bookshelf and pulled it out with optimism. \"Maybe Tod would wanna read this.\" Vixey ran off and went for Tod's house, remembering exactly where it was from the last time they met. Scene cuts to Tod throwing some red paint at something, which was shown to be a wall on his house. The painting was shown to be Terra punching a robot in the face, with Copper walking up to him and sitting next to him; both of them seemed fond of the painting as Tod looked at the audience. \"Trust me. This will be Terra when those robots come back. We'll be doing mine next, and then maybe Tyler's or Copper's depending on ideas.\" Copper dipped his paw into the red paint can, throwing it under the robot. It seemed to represent blood, with Copper questioning it. \"Can robots bleed?\" Tod shrugged and the two saw Vixey dashing up to them. When Vixey dashed up to Tod, she seemed very excited as she spoke. \"I have some information on the past of your clan's origin!\" Tod seemed intrigued by this and Vixey handed him the book she was reading earlier. When he opened it up, he seemed interested in what he was looking at. He could make out his mother just fine, but he became a bit anxious upon looking at it. \"I can certainly see that.\" \"You okay Tod?\" Copper asked with concern. \"This seems like something you'd enjoy.\" \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Tod assured Copper with a smile. \"This info could be useful for us anyway. If Signal's robots ever attack again then we'll be ready.\" Vixey looked at the wall and saw the painting Tod and Copper made, giggling upon the design and looking back at the two. \"Is that one of your siblings? It reminds me of Terra.\" Tod smiled with proudness that Vixey knew about his siblings as well. \"And you'd be right to think that. (Gets an idea) Hey; why don't we introduce you right now? If you have this kind of info then they'd be more than happy to meet you.\" Vixey seemed worried about how Tod's siblings would react to seeing her; especially considering what they went through eleven days ago. \"How do you think they'll react to you having met me the day after you met Signal?\" Tod shrugged and walked off with Copper, with Vixey walking off with them too. \"I guess it couldn't hurt. Better now than never.\" \"That's right.\" Tod replied with a hi five with Copper hi fiving Vixey as well. Scene cuts to Terra setting up some sort of basketball hoop in the living room. Terra backed up and grabbed the basketball Tod bought for her, aiming it directly at the hoop. When she got her aim ready, she smirked and jumped up as she shot; the ball would've likely had it's own ideas if it could move and talk, but Terra's idea was making the shot; which she did with ease. When the ball bounced back over to her, she dribbled it as she bragged a bit. \"And that's how it's done; no need to clap, as it'll only make me more cocky.\" \"Is that why you're playing in the living room?\" Terra looked to see her brother with Copper and Vixey, dashing up to the latter with intrigue. With Vixey seeming interested in Terra's natural childlike curiosity, Tod stepped up a bit and explained. \"This is Vixey. We met her the day after we met you.\" Copper stepped up in his own way and gave his own two cents on the scenario. \"Tod saved me from getting my butt chopped off by some evil knight thing and we arrived in her cave.\" Terra gave Tod and Copper a cold look as she spoke. \"Well of course you idiots would end up invading someone's home without their permission. (Smirks) To be fair though, I'd also be looking for the fastest shelter possible if some knight was trying to kill me.\" \"That's pretty much our story.\" Tod said with a chuckle. \"Actually Vixey knows some things about our clan (Terra flinches) due to some booksd she has on them.\" Terra grabbed Vixey's chest and looked into her eyes with her tsundere like coldness. \"If you're lying I'll hurt you.\" \"No need to worry Terra; (Pushes Terra away gently) I have all the honest information you could possibly want.\" Vixey assured Terra with high optimism. \"Let's get Tyler though too. He deserves to know just as much as you guys.\" \"Can I know too?\" Copper asked with excitement. \"Tod's clan sounds really cool.\" \"Find with me.\" Vixey responded with a shrug. \"Let's roll!\" Scene cuts to Tyler lying down in his room reading a novel of some sort. Tyler seemed to enjoy the novel he was reading, and then he heard his door fly open with Tod jumping in with excitement; and you can bet it made the elder brother laugh a bit. \"Something up Tod?\" \"Just that we have info on our family's clan.\" Tod explained as he jumped onto Tyler's bed with excitement, with the others coming in. \"We can learn more about our mom and everything; find out what our clan did before Signal attacked. Doesn't that sound awesome?\" Tyler seemed intrigued by all of this, having a couple memories of the past life of the clan himself. \"Sounds pretty interesting. Funny enough, the clan actually got seperated when I was three or four.\" Terra pulled Tyler off of his bed with intrigue. \"Well why didn't you say so to begin with?\" \"I didn't have a good time to bring it up until now.\" Tyler explained, and then he saw Vixey. \"I'm guessing you're a friend of theres.\" \"Yep. Name's Vixey.\" Vixey introduced herself with a smile, and then she showed Tyler the book she brought. \"This should explain anything before or after your clan got attacked.\" Copper looked at the cover of the book and found it rather intriguing. \"Why's the cover like that? Kinda looks like me and Tod in book form.\" \"Honestly, even I don't know.\" Vixey admitted, and then she opened the book up. \"I just thought it was a touch to make it more intriguing. Anyway, which memory do you guys wanna look at first?\" \"Maybe to one before Tyler's time.\" Tod suggested. \"He'd probably wanna know something about that.\" Vixey nodded and turned to what looked like a land that looked like London. \"The clan from before Tyler was born made their home in London; which fun fact, I come from.\" \"That explains the accent.\" Copper added in. \"At least you're not a stereotype.\" \"Yeah, that would've been torture.\" Vixey laughed a bit as she then explained how the town worked. \"Anyway, onto the town itself.\" The first part of the town we saw appeared to be a castle that showed a young vixen, who seemed to be an adult walking through it. \"Fondly enough, your mom just so happened to be the Queen. Pretty cliche I know, but that's not all she had to her; trust me.\" The Queen looked out her window and looked over her town, loving every inch of what it showed. She then heard the door opening with her husband, who was the King of the town, walking in with a serious look. \"We've been training for at least three hours Maria. Interesting progress has been made.\" \"That's nice Daniel; good luck with that.\" Maria stood up with a cheerful look and put her paws on Daniel's shoulders. \"You really gotta lay back though. We haven't had an attack in two years now.\" \"That doesn't mean we can't train Maria.\" Daniel stated. \"I can't bare what would happen if I saw you being tortured or slit or anything like that.\" \"And that's one of the many reasons we love each other.\" Maria gave Daniel a cheek kiss and giggled a bit. \"But that doesn't mean you can't have fun either. All work and no fun is no way to live a life, I always say.\" Daniel smiled upon his wife's words, walking off with her as Vixey explained some more stuff. \"Although Maria wasn't from London, she WAS able to become the queen of a small town in London after she dethroned the previous Queen, who was an abysmal ruler that would in her own words, come back to smite her; and despite her and her husband Daniel living in different countreis, they were more than prepared to show their town both fun, and work.\" The next memory in the book that was shown just so happened to be Maria hanging out with her friends as Vixey continued with her words. \"And as you can clearly tell by now, Maria was more fond of the former.\" Maria let out a laugh as she spoke to her friends, who just so happened to be foxes from London; just like Daniel, only female. \"I still can't believe that happened Cora. That must've been insane.\" \"Oh believe me, it was.\" Cora laughed a bit herself. \"It was so bad that I shoved that bloody pile of cow poop known as Grace right down the sewer for payback; the kim in her online name practically read animal vomit!\" Cora laughed a bit more and then Tod questioned something. \"Hold up. How did they have technology?\" \"Didn't they have jousting or whatever it was?\" Terra asked in addition to Tod's question. \"They must've developed it properly.\" Tyler guessed. \"It was like that when I was born.\" \"That explains the slight british in our own voices.\" Tod giggled a bit at the thought of him being half british. \"Now I know why my singing voice is like that.\" \"I always did like that little hint of the accent from when we met.\" Vixey said with fondness. \"Anyway, back to the information.\" Cora spoke again and this time she spoke about something she thought of for an alternative for Grace's karma show. \"Perhaps I should've just shamed her on social media, but where's the fun in that when I can just do it in real life?\" The girls laughed as Cora then continued. \"Of course, she'd know where it was from, but that's what makes it more fun.\" One of the vixens was shown adjusting her glasses as Vixey explained her role. \"One of them was known as Cora, who was pretty much a diva. The one in the glasses was Daria, only not the girl from the Tv show; even if they're similar. I think I relate to her the best, at least in the hobby department.\" \"You three can be so childish.\" Daria implied, finding this torture for fun stuff to be a waste of time. \"I won't exactly tell you HOW to have fun, but I WILL say that your ideas are rather lackluster; I never got into them myself.\" Cora shoved an ice cream into Daria's face, with her not even bothered by it. She even wiped it off with a smile and shoved it back into her face. \"Though, I wouldn't be in this group if I wasn't smart enough to see the innocence of it.\" \"I doubt you would've.\" Cora laughed a bit more and then she looked at Maria. \"So Maria. I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I managed to get away with this thing back in my old town that's (Pulls up a gauntlet) totally power heavy.\" Maria looked at the gauntlet and became amazed by the structure. \"Yeah, I'm bad, but I don't care.\" A vixen with an eye patch on her left eye was drinking from a tall jug, seeming to be the edgy one of the group. \"The emo right there is Tiana. Her creepy vibe is deffinetely enough to give ME chills.\" Tiana put her glass down and looked at Cora with a sour look. \"If I lived in your town I most likely would've stopped you; friend or not. But since you got it before we met, I'll defend you if you get caught.\" Cora rolled her eyes while smiling and put the gauntlet up on the shelf, preparing herself for a night of fun. \"Let's say we all go to the back of the castle later and test this puppy out. You gave him the ear muffs, right Maria?\" Maria gave a thumbs up to Cora and looked at the gauntlet again, being fascinated by the beauty in it's golden coat. Scene cuts to Maria and her friends checking out the gauntlet behind the castle late at night. Maria seemed to be really intrigued by the gauntlet, having never seen anything like it up close. Of course, Daniel was always protecting the heck out of her, so it made the reveal a lot more exciting. She wondered what beauty it could've held, having never done anything with it before. Cora put her paw on it however, being the first one to speak. \"Alright girls. Anyone wanna put this on before me? Cause I've never used it before.\" \"I'll wear it.\" Maria responded, and Cora gave her the gauntlet and let her put it on. When it locked onto Maria's paw, it confused her; this was until she saw the power it held when shot up into the air. Although she didn't know she did it, she and her friends were fastinated by what it did next. It was nothing other than a firework show. Good thing Daniel wore his ear muffs that night. \"Fastinating.\" Daria took out her notes and wrote in them, adoring the sight she saw. Never before had she known how any sort of firework show was made. Even if she knew it wasn't official, it was still beautiful enough to write about. Tiana seemed to be almost smiling from it, which Maria noticed. \"Someone's near smiling.\" Tiana blushed a bit and Maria giggled at her shyness. \"Don't worry; we won't tell any goth club. If you have one. Just note that happiness is an important emotion for everyone.\" The four friends continued to watch the fireowork show, which got the attention of many animals nearby. They went over to watch with them, finding it to be just as fascinating at they did. Maria allowed a mouse to climb up onto her finger and get a better view, letting it see the show up close. Cora scoffed with a smile towards Maria's soft nature, finding their personalities so similar yet so different; both at the same time. Maria brought Cora in for a hug and then her other friends in as well. Cora rolled her eyes while smiling and Tiana felt a bit off by it, but did like it, with Daria also liking it as they all looked at the show. The show itself was fastinating for the eye itself, as well as many others. Tod seemed fastinated by this himself and couldn't help but speak up when the screen went back to him and the others. \"So they were that close, huh?\" \"Sure were.\" Vixey felt as if the book tied into Tod's future somehow, seeing as if he was similar to his mother in a way. \"Ya know Tod, you're a lot like how your mom was. Fun loving, bubbly, optimistic, seeking adventure and excitement, you have a lot of traits that she had.\" Tod smiled upon those words, finding that he and his mom would've gotten along great. \"Of course, you didn't know her for too long, but I know for a fact that you would've had a great time with her.\" Tod looked at the book and figured that he could learn a lot more about his family if he kept reading it. \"Mind if I keep this?\" \"Go ahead.\" Vixey replied as she handed Tod the book. \"And don't worry about damaging it either. I spilt a soda on it one time and it just washed right off.\" Tod nodded and looked at the book again, still finding it amazing that his family had an entire book about themselves. \"So this has all of the information on our parents and their past lives.\" Vixey nodded and Tod smiled widely, loving what could come. \"Should be an awesome ride.\" Scene cuts to Tod lying down on a hill near his house with Copper, with both of them looking at the sky. Tod started thinking about what his mother would think about where he's standing right now. He hadn't gotten very far yet, but he was more than capable of finding it in himself to stop Signal; however he was planning on doing so. He did have a bit of fighting experience from the fourth year he lived with Jake for, but he didn't know if that would be enough. Feeling as if he'd need assistance, he looked at Copper, who was looking at the sky with him. \"Copper?\" Copper looked at Tod, who asked his question. \"How strong do you think Signal will be?\" \"I dunno.\" Copper admitted as he sat up, with Tod sitting up after him. \"Probably pretty strong. I mean, she has a bunch of armies, and she probably punches a lot of them in the face.\" Copper questioned Signal's power himself after that one. \"Maybe she'll just make us a giant cake and call it a day.\" Tod giggled a bit at Copper's words of silliness, figuring that to not be the case. \"I doubt it dude.\" Tod looked up to the sky and seemed conflicted. \"Though, she most likely is one of the strongest warriors ever. And if we ever found anyone as strong as her then it'd be a miracle.\" Tod got an idea and looked back at Copper with a smile. \"I say we open up a dojo.\" Copper took a liking to that idea and smiled back at Tod. \"I could go for...whatever the heck that is. It's a food, right? I've lived with a hunter and wolfhound my whole life, so I wouldn't know.\" Tod signaled Copper to walk with him as the two headed off, hoping to get the dojo done once Copper knew what it was, with Tod looking at the audience. \"So it's pretty obvious that I'm too weak to take on Signal at the moment, but I'll let you see what I'm planning; even though I just told you a part of it with Copper.\" Scene cuts to Tod and Copper setting up some wood outside the house with Kevin popping out of the wagon Tod was pulling. Tod helped Kevin out of the wagon and the two of them hi fived. \"Thanks for joining us Kevin. We figured that since we built your place we might as well let you help us with this.\" \"No problem Tod.\" Kevin then put his finger on Tod's chest with a smirk. \"Just don't fart on me this time.\" Tod snickered a bit at Kevin's words and Kevin headed to the base with Copper, along with Tod looking at the audience. \"We may do most of this off screen, but I'll let you see our building in the next chapter. (Starts walking to the building site) Anyway, I feel this dojo will give us a major power boost for when Signal attacks. I also know that Terra will love it.\" Tod picked up a hammer and started hammering a nail in. \"Even if it takes a while.\" Tod continued hammering to get the nail in as the screen faded to black, ending the episode off. Light guitar music plays during the credits as Tod is seen walking through the forest. A female voice prepared to sing My mother as Tod looked at the ground in a sorrow mood once the song began, showing Tod's struggle with his mother's death and his new life. \"As much as I love my life there are truths that I can't deny.\" Tod passed over some shadows of Signal and her minions confronting him. \"If I hadn't seen my mother die then time could just fly by.\" Tod then saw a vision of Signal attempting to kill him, sending fear down his spine. \"But even with all of this in my mind and all of this known pain.\" Tod tried to shake off the memory, not letting it get to him. \"If I just let it affect me then there's nothing to gain.\" Copper was seen walking through the forest with a rather upset look on his face, struggling to find who he was as the song continued from another female singer. \"And even with these thoughts in mind and all that I can see.\" Copper looked up to the sky, having images of Chief teaching him how to hunt. \"Deep down inside my heart I just don't know what I want to be.\" Copper looked at the rabbit doll in the clouds above, not wanting to hurt it. \"I know they're trying to help me but I don't want this life.\" Copper looked on ahead with confusion in his eyes. \"And although I'm grateful for their support inside I have this strife.\" Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest together, both confused as the song continued with both female singers. \"Both of these memories from within show how we struggle with our lives.\" Tod arrived at a hill as he looked over it, holding back his tears of pain. \"The loss of grief and choice of life show how which one of us survives.\" Tod looked to see Copper next to him, both having similar pain. \"But even with this thought inside me I won't let it be a bother.\" Tod smiled and scooted closer to Copper, wrapping his arm around him. \"Cause us best friends won't ever want to try to hurt each other.\" Copper smiled upon the comfort of Tod, both of them looking over the hill as these last lyrics were sung, as well as them appearing on the screen from the first singer. \"I will get the proudness deserved from and by my mother.\"[Chapter 6] The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy Season one Episode six: Balancing Enjoyment Anime rock music played during the credits as the song Prophecy was heard while a male singer was heard. Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest as a male started singing. \"This is the power of my friends, and family with it.\" Tod and Copper jumped into a pond and started splashing one another along with a wolf cub. \"Even if it's not all that simple and has hard stuff to fit.\" Terra was seen at the top of a tree as she jumped from the highest branch. \"I know there's more to me than being a simple kid.\" Terra cannonballed into the pond, splashing Tyler, who was seen tuning his guitar. \"But for my siblings life, that's nothing that I'd bid.\" Tyler jumped into the pool and Vixey popped up next to Tod, making the fox kit blush and smile while rubbing his arm. \"It's complicated, but I don't care. My life may just flash like a flare.\" Tod and the others were seen punching, kicking, and biting Signal's minions. \"But as long as you're here I could care less!\" Jake was seen slashing the robots in half with a sword. \"Even if I die today!\" Signal's eyes were shown with a dark glow. \"It'll be a noble decay!\" Tod and Signal were seen punching and kicking one another in the air. \"My family's not something I'd give up so easily!\" Tod shot a bullet at Signal, who deflected it right back at Tod and his him in the knee. \"My friends and family, are important to me!\" Tod sneered at Signal and managed to charge at her. \"And I will find the truth in the prophecy!\" Tod glowed a bright red color and then he aimed a punch at Signal upon the final lyrics. \"That's right, I will find the truth in the prophecy.\" Tod and the others were seen going onto the title screen, with Tod front flipping onto the screen next to Copper, being adventurous and optimistic, Copper being kind and timid, Terra skateboarding onto the screen with tsundere feistiness and playfulness, Tyler tuning his guitar and giving a peace sign to the audience with care and calmness, the wolf kicking down the door and flipping off the audience, showing his cocky and selfish side, Vixey showing her bookworm and researcher side when walking on screen, and Jake slashing through the wall and jumping on with the others, and then The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy appeared behind them. Scene cuts to Tod sitting on top of the new dojo that he made with Copper and Kevin while being proud of his accomplishment. Tod started to think about how his mother would feel about this, wishing that she was still around to see it. Terra bursted out of the room with some kind of karate gear on. \"Yeah baby! That was a nice one!\" Terra looked up and saw Tod, giving him a peace sign. \"Thanks for the dojo Tod. (Puts paw down) How did you get all of the stuff for it?\" \"I just bought it off of Ebay.\" Tod explained, and then Terra gave him a peace sign and jumped back into the dojo, leaving Tod to slide down the wall and walk off. \"Let's hope this is as helpful as I hoped.\" Tod looked at the audience as he spoke of his issue. \"I bet there are a few children in the world who had to deal with one of their parent's dying, and believe me when I say that I can relate. I know I don't show it, but it really was a tragedy for me; I just don't wanna look like a whiny emo.\" Tod giggled a bit at that line. \"Then again, I don't think mentioning it every now and then would be anything like that.\" Copper was lying down on his barrel and Tod ran over to him when he saw this. When the young fox jumped onto the barrel, he couldn't help but joke a bit. \"Last time I checked, this isn't how you do a barrel roll.\" \"Boo!\" Tod and Copper looked up to see Kevin in the tree above them as the young wolf jumped down to them. \"For reals though. Why're you just lying here? Ya goin all emo or something?\" \"Amos tied me up again.\" Copper explained, wishing he wasn't tied up. If there was anything he hated, it was that. \"He said I'm not focusing on my hunting skills enough and I gotta not run off to get back on track.\" Tod jumped down and stuck one of his claws out, cutting the rope in half and freeing Copper. \"Another thing that wasn't the same last time I checked it, kids being deprived from fun.\" Copper and Kevin smiled and Tod signaled them to follow him, leading to the trio heading off to the forest. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin walking around and trying to find something fun to do. Tod started to itch with excitement, thinking about all the awesome things that could happen. While looking around, he saw so much in both the air and the ground while also feeling the urge to find excitement. Kevin noticed this and wondered what was up. \"You okay there dude?\" \"Yeah, I'm always itching for an awesome time.\" Tod replied with his usual bubbly attitude. He hadn't spent much time with Kevin yet, so it made sense that the wolf pup didn't know that yet. \"There's endless amounts of excitement in this world.\" \"I don't know about endless.\" Copper said as he walked up to Tod and Kevin. \"Don't forget that adults try to rule everything. One wrong move from them and it's straight to no fun allowed USA. (Sighs) That's something I wish Chief and Amos would realize.\" Upbeat music started to play, which confused Kevin, and Tod started speaking with high optimism. \"They'll see it someday Copper. (Looks at Kevin as he opens his mouth) And here's your answer Kevin.\" Kevin closed his mouth and Tod walked ahead of Copper and Kevin as he started to sing We all need some fun. \" It's almost as if every adult, loses their sense of fun, whenever they grow up they all just assume that it's done. (Jumps onto a rock with Copper and Kevin sitting down and watching him) It's not exactly their fault, but it sure would seem like it, cause some of them use it as an excuse to throw a fit. \" Tod continued singing with some birds flying over to the tree above him and moving their bodies to his beat. \" Now I'm not saying they're all boring, as there are some fun ones too, but it's just a known fact from me to (Points to Copper) you and (Points to Kevin) you. (Jumps down from the rock) Almost every adult born, from the day they turn eighteen, it's all work and little fun in their routine. \" Tod ran off with Copper and Kevin running after him as Tod continued singing with the music getting a bit louder in the process. \" Little do they know, that there's more to life than that; almost every child knows one soda won't make ya fat! (Runs past some leaves with Copper and Kevin as they start flying) If they could relearn, what it's like to play and run, then everyone would know (Stops and turns around to face Copper and Kevin) that we all need some fun. \" The leaves flew past the screen with Tod, Copper, and Kevin climbing up a tree with the music going back to normal. When Tod arrived at the top first, he continued to sing as the animals on the tree saw this and smiled at it. \" Now I'm not saying they're all bad, as there are some that know this fact, (Holds his paw out and lets a bird land on his finger) heck, there are even some who made a fun pact. \" The bird started swaying to the music of Tod's singing as the young fox kit continued. \" There are even a few kids, who get caught up all in work, and can't even focus on the fun times not even the tree birk. (The bird flies off as Tod raises his paw) That balance is even true, to the animals all around, some know how to have fun and still stick with the crowd. (Tod jumps down from the tree and Copper and Kevin start climbing down) It's true that work is needed, (Starts sliding down a tree) to get anywhere at all , (Starts jumping from tree to tree) b ut sometimes to do what you want (Copper and Kevin slide down to Tod) y ou gotta take the fall. \" Tod walks through another part of the forest as Copper and Kevin follow him with the music getting a bit louder. \" It's not as if either one, is all one or the other; there's still some in both that lose the will to run! (Walks up to the end of a cliff with Copper and Kevin behind him) I hope one day in this world, all children and adults see; it's so clear to those who know that we all need some fun. \" Copper and Kevin sat down next to Tod, who finished up the song when the music went back to normal. \" It's so clear to those who know that we all need some fun. \" Tod, Copper, and Kevin looked over the cliff and saw a beautiful view of the lower part of the forest. From the streams flowing and the birds flying around, the view was something to behold for all three of them. Even Kevin, who was the clear jerk and gashole of the group. Tod then looked at the audience and said one final line. \"Don't get the wrong idea though. Everyone has their own way of fun.\" Tod winked to the audience and continued to look over the cliff with them. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin walking through the forest while talking about the time they had. \"Who knew you could have so much entertainment just by sitting somewhere?\" Kevin asked, amazed at the view he found with Tod and Copper. \"We gotta go to that cliff again sometime.\" \"Yeah, the veiw itself was incredible.\" Copper looked back on the view with fondness. \"I wonder why they call it a cliff though.\" \"Beats me.\" Tod pinned Copper down and made the Bloodhound smile. \"But I know why they call this a tug.\" Tod started tugging on Copper's ear and making him laugh with innocence as Kevin watched and saw a form of friendly affection. \"What the heck is goin on here!?\" Tod, Copper, and Kevin look to see Chief walking up to them, sounding pretty stern as he spoke. \"I wake up after my nap to find Copper to have run along with you whippersnappers? What in the heck are you even doin this far out in the forest?\" Tod got off of Copper and helped him up as he looked at Chief with his usual look of optimism. \"Lighten up a bit Chief; we were just havin some fun out here.\" \"Fun?\" Chief raised an eyebrow as he spoke to Tod, keeping his stern voice. \"Kid, Copper doesn't need fun in his life; he's got plenty of stuff to do.\" Copper seemed to be a bit dissapointed when he heard that with Tod sticking up for him. \"Everyone needs fun in their life. All work is no way to life a life; I literally just sang a whole song about it.\" \"And I'm sure it was good, but that doesn't mean Copper can run along waggin his tail to everything that crosses.\" Chief walked off and looked back at Copper. \"Cmon Copper. We gotta get home before Amos does.\" Copper sighed and walked off with Tod and Kevin looking at him with worry. Scene cuts to Tod playing video games in his room as Kevin climbs up to his window. Kevin jumped onto Tod's bed and sat down next to him seeming to have some bad news in mind. \"I tried Tod. I went to Copper's place to see how he was doing, but Chief wouldn't let me near him.\" \"You too huh?\" Tod asked, and then he sighed at the bad luck they were having. They just couldn't get why Chief didn't want Copper to hang out with them. \"It's like he wants us dead or something, ya know? Like, we go up to his place and he growls at us as soon as he sees us like a vulture.\" \"Yeah, but when I did it he almost barked cause I screwed with him a bit.\" Tod rolls his eyes while smiling as Kevin continues his words. \"But yeah, you got a good point there.\" Tod paused his game and started to wonder what he and Kevin could do to help Copper. \"There's gotta be some way we can help Copper, as well as help Chief see that what he's doing is wrong.\" Tod and Kevin try to think of something with Tod shrugging. \"I got nothing.\" \"Me either.\" Kevin admitted. \"I mean, it's not like we can just trick him into thinking he's been shot or something tragic.\" Tod got a hint of inspiration from Kevin's words, even if he wasn't going to use that exact idea. \"Why don't we just trick Chief into thinking there's a threat? That way we can keep him busy enough to let Copper enjoy more of his childhood.\" Kevin smiled and took a liking to the idea, with Tod then getting another thought. \"Hold on. Wouldn't this seem hypocritical since the song I sang earlier also stated that some adults could have fun?\" \"Nah, Chief just has to learn how to have fun again.\" Kevin reminded Tod, at least with the lyrics. \"It's like what I think the name of the song is. We all need some fun.\" Tod saw Kevin's point and the two fist bumped, ready to set their plan into motion. The next day Scene cuts to Tod painting on something while trying to get the perfect picture of it's design. Tod dipped his brush into the brown paint and put some more on whatever he was painting. He wanted to make sure that it was good enough to look realistic, at least until Chief saw what they were planning. When he put the final touches on it, he put his brush down and kissed his fingers like an artist would, and his project was then revealed to be a bear. Kevin got a look as well, finding it to be more than suitable. \"Deffinetely something Leonardo Decaprio would make.\" \"Leonardo da Vinci.\" Tod corrected. \"But hey; at least you got his first name right.\" Tod and Kevin then got back on track. \"Now let's see if Chief thinks this is real.\" Tod and Kevin ran off and Chief was then shown to be sleeping with Tod sneaking up to him. He then bonked on his head, which instantly alerted him. \"Chief, there's a bear in the forest dude! He said he was gonna eat Copper and everything!\" \"You gotta hurry before he gets here and tries to chop his head off!\" Kevin added, as well as putting something else on the table. \"His claws are like swords and that's automatically threatening!\" Chief feared what could've possible happen to Copper, leaning over to Tod and Kevin with a serious look. \"Don't tell Copper what I'm about to do.\" Tod and Kevin nodded and Chief ran off, ready to face whatever the bear had in store for him. Tod and Kevin snickered a bit as they walked up to Copper with Tod commenting on it. \"What an idiot.\" Tod cut Copper's rope with the red fox then nudging the young Bloodhound and speaking to him. \"Wake up Copper.\" Copper woke up with a smile, glad to see Tod and Kevin. He didn't know Chief left, so he thought the old timer accepted them as Copper's friends. \"Tod; Kevin! (Stands up) Does this mean Chief got over his issues?\" \"Nope. We made him think there was a bear.\" Kevin explained. \"He'll probably find out in about a milisecond, but who cares?\" Copper started to feel a bit worried with Kevin then pulling him out of his barrel. \"Cmon dumbo. Let's go enjoy ourselves while he's gone.\" Copper thought for a moment and shrugged, with the trio running off to have some fun. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin chilling by the pond and sitting in it with relaxed expressions. Tod, Copper, and Kevin all sighed of relief with bubbles then coming out from underneath Kevin. Tod and Copper looked at Kevin and scooted away a bit, making sure not to get touched by Kevin's underwater butt bomb. Tod then went to change the subject, glad to see Copper having a good time. \"It sure is nice to have all three of us hanging out. Especially with Chief distracted by that bear.\" Kevin snickered a bit, wondering how Chief was still distracted himself. \"Totally. I'm honestly surprised that the nimrod hasn't figured it out yet.\" \"Maybe you guys just did such a good job at making it.\" Copper suggested, wondering what an art museum would be like. \"I could see it being the star attraction in a museum, waiting for all the tourists to look at it and give them a good time.\" \"If it does then I can even picture a name.\" Tod put his paws in the air and moved them apart slowly as he spoke. \"The bear that tricked Chief.\" The trio snickered with Tod cracking a joke about Chief. \"Seriously. If uptight had a nickname, it'd be Chief.\" Kevin tried to think up a good joke too, coming up with one on the spot. \"Or if boring was a nickname. I wouldn't be surprised if he went out of his way to ruin fun all together.\" Chief was shown walking through the forest while getting the thorns off of him. \"Stupid kids, makin me go after a fake bear.\" Chief overheard the trio laughing and got a serious look on his face. \"Those mother-\" Tod, Copper, and Kevin were getting out of the pool with all three of them giggling together. Tod then spoke up, feeling as if they were done making fun of Chief. \"But even then, Chief at least doesn't have evil intentions. (Chief walks up to a tree and spies on Tod, Copper, and Kevin) He's just stubborn; that's all.\" \"He's just gotta get used to you guys, that's all.\" Copper replied with his usual friendly expression. \"Trust me. You'll grow onto him, one day or another.\" Chief extended his claws and started barking, alerting the trio and this line coming from Tod. \"We're dead.\" Tod and Kevin managed to avoid Chief's lunge with Copper signaling them to bail. \"Run guys, run!\" Tod and Kevin ran off as fast as they could with Chief hopping out of the water. \"Chief, please; they weren't doing anything.\" \"That'd be right if trickin me into fighting a fake bear so you could sneak off was nothing!\" Chief pointed out, and then he dropped his aggression for a bit. \"Not gonna lie though, they did a pretty good job.\" Chief ran off with Tod and Kevin seeing him gang up behind them. Kevin in particular was scared, not wanting to die just yet. \"Isn't this a bit much!?\" \"Apparently not for him!\" Tod remarked, with the two of them trying to think of a way to lose Kevin. The two of them went through some bushes with Chief still barking as Tod and Kevin arrived at the other side. The two of them ran over to the other side of the road with them then panting over it. \"Forget safety laws. When someone's after you, they could get you killed. (Looks at the audience) That doesn't mean you should never use them though.\" Chief jumped out from the bushes and walked up to Tod and Kevin slowly, with the fox and wolf fearing for their lives. Kevin himself tried to lighten up the mood by making Chief drop the whole thing. \"Now I know what you're thinking. Should I kill them. And the answer, may surprise you.\" Chief pinned Kevin to the ground with Tod being so scared that he could barely move. \"Please don't kill me!\" \"You should've thought about that before you tried to send Copper over the edge.\" Tod seemed confused by what Chief was saying, while Kevin was so frightened that he couldn't think. When Copper showed up, he saw what was happening just as Chief bit Kevin by his neck. Copper was horrified by what he saw as Tod then grabbed a rock and threw it at Chief's eye. Chief let go of Kevin and fell onto his back with Tod and Copper rushing to his aid. \"Kevin!\" Kevin couldn't hear Tod or Copper's shouts due to being too injured to stay awake, with Tod then putting his paw up to his heart. Tod wiped his forehead, still frightened, but was also calm enough to point out Kevin's condition. \"He's not dead yet. If we hurry we can get him to Jake.\" Just then, the dog catcher came and skidded across the road, spotting Tod and the others and getting out of his car. \"Well well well. This is something I didn't expect.\" The dog catcher walked up to the four of them and saw kevin on the ground. \"This your friend?\" Tod pointed at his throat to show that they couldn't speak, so the dog catcher handed him a pen and paper. When he wrote on it, he wrote that he'd explain what happened when they got to Jake's house. He handed the note back to the dog catcher and he nodded after he read it. \"Any idea where this Jake kid lives?\" Tod signaled the dog catcher to drive him and the others back home, which they did as he got in, allowing them to jump in as closed the door. Copper made sure to be careful with Kevin with Chief then seeing how much the trio cared about each other, feeling rotten for what he did and jumping on in. Tod didn't seem to mind too much, despite not having the happiest of thoughts with Chief. Copper on the other hand felt a bit uncomfortable, with the dog catcher speaking up. \"The Wolfhound too?\" Tod nodded and the dog catcher nodded back with Chief closing the door as he drove off. Tod looked at Kevin again and placed his paw on his chest, feeling his beating heart and feeling tha they still had a chance to save him. Scene cuts to Tod and the others arriving back at where they lived with Tod and Copper pulling Kevin out as Chief and the dog catcher hopped out as well. Tod handed Kevin to Copper as he then looked back at the dog catcher with a thumbs up. The dog catcher gave a thumbs up back and drove off with Tod and Copper looking at Kevin with concern. Tod and Copper took Kevin up to Tod's house and walked inside with Jake seeing Kevin and getting worried. \"Is that the Kevin kid you told me about?\" \"Sure is, and we gotta save him quick.\" Tod and Copper set Kevin down on the table, hoping that they could save him in time. \"We'll explain everything as soon as we can, but for now we have to make sure his neck doesn't bleed too much.\" Jake nodded and ran off to get something with Tod and Copper worrying for Kevin's life. \"That sure did hit me hard dude. I never knew Chief was that insane.\" \"Neither did I.\" Chief overheard Tod and Copper's words with Copper continuing his own. \"I mean he's a hunter yeah, but I never thought he'd go after a kid.\" Copper started to wonder what to think of Chief after this event. \"It's almost like he only cares about what HE wants.\" Chief started to wonder if he's been too hard on Copper. After all, he was only a child, so of course he'd need some fun in his life. When Jake got back with a first aid kit, he asked Tod something that the young fox expected. \"So what happened?\" Tod whispered the scenario into Jake's ear with Jake taking a bit of surprise to it. \"So he finally went to child murder, huh?\" \"Guess so.\" Tod started to wonder what could've happened to Chief to make him hate fun so much. \"I just hope whatever he went through stops soon. Cause no one deserves what Chief's feelin.\" Copper started to worry about Chief himself, and then both of them focused back on Kevin. Scene cuts to Kevin lying down on Tod's bed as the young fox kit leaves him a large pizza slice. Copper walked into Tod's room and sat down next to him as they ate their pizza slices together. He started to wonder how Kevin would heal considering the scenario. \"So how's Kevin doing?\" \"He's doing pretty good so far, at least for someone who's in a coma.\" Tod replied. \"He should be up in at least an hour, so let's hope nothing bad's happened to him. (Looks at the audience) And for all you Kevin fans out there who're pissed about this fakeout death, it's episode six; what do you expect? We can't have someone die yet.\" Tod sensed Chief's presence and then gave a blunt look. \"I know you're there Chief.\" Chief came out with Tod keeping his cool and speaking calmly. \"What do you want? I have a life to live and I'd prefer to have my butt on while it happens.\" \"I know. I just wanted to talk.\" Tod allowed Chief to speak up as the Wolfhound then breathed in and out. \"I'm sorry about what I did to your friend. And I know this won't fix everything, but I just hope that this doesn't make any bad blood between you and Copper. I saw how much you two care about that Kevin kid in the dog catcher's car.\" Tod smirked, liking how Chief barely understood what friendship meant. \"Well that'd be pretty hard to destroy since it was YOUR teeth that put him into this.\" Chief chuckled a bit with a blush as Tod then spoke up a bit more. \"Look Chief. I know we likely won't be friends anytime soon, but I'm glad to see that we at least aren't enemies. In fact, I have an idea in sorts.\" Copper and Chief become intrigued when they hear Tod's words. Two hours later Scene cuts to Tod with a hose as he sprays it down some sort of slide on the hill where he and Copper play sometimes. Tod signaled Jake to turn the hose off, which he did, allowing the water to flow down the water slide with ease. Tod then walked up to the others with Kevin seen poking his patch. \"As you can clearly see, water slides equal instant fun, even if you can't swim. And in addition to instant fun, you also get to have it with multiple people. Well, at least if you don't mind having to wait turns.\" \"I heard this one thing about elderlys getting more patient than kids.\" Copper stated. \"I don't know if that's true or not, but if that's the case then I don't wanna think about how impatient regular adults are.\" Tod and Kevin snickered at that thought with Chief rolling his eyes as Tod then spoke up. \"Well even if that's true, I doubt adults are immune to fun. And to show what I mean, we'll all be going down this. You first Copper.\" Copper nodded and went down the slide with Kevin looking at Chief with a nervous look on his face. \"So...yeah. (Scratches the back of his head) We're chill, right? No hard feelings over what went down.\" \"Heh. Kid, that's the most surprising reaction I've heard from anyone.\" Chief implied. \"And I hunted for rabbits.\" Chief went down the slide and Tod allowed Kevin to go down next. Tod turned to the audience as he wrapped up what the chapter was meant to state. \"I know, I know, this was a lot more peaceful than you'd expect from a fantasy story. But hey. Not every chapter's gonna be on the level of Naruto in terms of action. This was more or less just a way of showing that adults can have just as much fun as kids, even if they have a hard time getting into it. Sometimes, they just need an invite.\" \"Yo Tod!\" Tod looked down to see Copper calling up to him with a smile. \"When you're done talking to your audience thing, do a belly slide!\" Tod nodded as he left off one final word to the crowd, as well as his friends. \"Geronibunga!\" Tod slid right into the camera, making the screen fade to black and end the episode off. Light guitar music plays during the credits as Tod is seen walking through the forest. A female voice prepared to sing My mother as Tod looked at the ground in a sorrow mood once the song began, showing Tod's struggle with his mother's death and his new life. \"As much as I love my life there are truths that I can't deny.\" Tod passed over some shadows of Signal and her minions confronting him. \"If I hadn't seen my mother die then time could just fly by.\" Tod then saw a vision of Signal attempting to kill him, sending fear down his spine. \"But even with all of this in my mind and all of this known pain.\" Tod tried to shake off the memory, not letting it get to him. \"If I just let it affect me then there's nothing to gain.\" Copper was seen walking through the forest with a rather upset look on his face, struggling to find who he was as the song continued from another female singer. \"And even with these thoughts in mind and all that I can see.\" Copper looked up to the sky, having images of Chief teaching him how to hunt. \"Deep down inside my heart I just don't know what I want to be.\" Copper looked at the rabbit doll in the clouds above, not wanting to hurt it. \"I know they're trying to help me but I don't want this life.\" Copper looked on ahead with confusion in his eyes. \"And although I'm grateful for their support inside I have this strife.\" Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest together, both confused as the song continued with both female singers. \"Both of these memories from within show how we struggle with our lives.\" Tod arrived at a hill as he looked over it, holding back his tears of pain. \"The loss of grief and choice of life show how which one of us survives.\" Tod looked to see Copper next to him, both having similar pain. \"But even with this thought inside me I won't let it be a bother.\" Tod smiled and scooted closer to Copper, wrapping his arm around him. \"Cause us best friends won't ever want to try to hurt each other.\" Copper smiled upon the comfort of Tod, both of them looking over the hill as these last lyrics were sung, as well as them appearing on the screen from the first singer. \"I will get the proudness deserved from and by my mother.\"[Chapter 7] The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy Season one Episode seven: Powers that were Formerly Unknown Anime rock music played during the credits as the song Prophecy was heard while a male singer was heard. Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest as a male started singing. \"This is the power of my friends, and family with it.\" Tod and Copper jumped into a pond and started splashing one another along with a wolf cub. \"Even if it's not all that simple and has hard stuff to fit.\" Terra was seen at the top of a tree as she jumped from the highest branch. \"I know there's more to me than being a simple kid.\" Terra cannonballed into the pond, splashing Tyler, who was seen tuning his guitar. \"But for my siblings life, that's nothing that I'd bid.\" Tyler jumped into the pool and Vixey popped up next to Tod, making the fox kit blush and smile while rubbing his arm. \"It's complicated, but I don't care. My life may just flash like a flare.\" Tod and the others were seen punching, kicking, and biting Signal's minions. \"But as long as you're here I could care less!\" Jake was seen slashing the robots in half with a sword. \"Even if I die today!\" Signal's eyes were shown with a dark glow. \"It'll be a noble decay!\" Tod and Signal were seen punching and kicking one another in the air. \"My family's not something I'd give up so easily!\" Tod shot a bullet at Signal, who deflected it right back at Tod and his him in the knee. \"My friends and family, are important to me!\" Tod sneered at Signal and managed to charge at her. \"And I will find the truth in the prophecy!\" Tod glowed a bright red color and then he aimed a punch at Signal upon the final lyrics. \"That's right, I will find the truth in the prophecy.\" Tod and the others were seen going onto the title screen, with Tod front flipping onto the screen next to Copper, being adventurous and optimistic, Copper being kind and timid, Terra skateboarding onto the screen with tsundere feistiness and playfulness, Tyler tuning his guitar and giving a peace sign to the audience with care and calmness, the wolf kicking down the door and flipping off the audience, showing his cocky and selfish side, Vixey showing her bookworm and researcher side when walking on screen, and Jake slashing through the wall and jumping on with the others, and then The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy appeared behind them. Scene cuts to Tod running around with Terra in the forest as the young fox gave his sister a playful chase. Terra kept on running and didn't look back, hearing Tod's playful laugh as she kept up the escape. That was until she stopped hearing the laugh. When she stopped running and looked back, she became confused. She wasn't quite sure where Tod went off to. Although she would've broken a bone of his if he'd bailed on her, she was showing genuine concern for him with her expression. Tod was hiding in a bush when he sushed the audience and whispered to them. \"I can't miss this one.\" Tod tackled Terra and exclaimed his success. \"Got ya!\" Tod and Terra rolled down the hill to the pond and Terra started laughing when Tod blew raspberries on her stomach. Terra kicked Tod into the pond with both legs and got up, with Tod rising up and rubbing his chest. \"Hey, you never warned for any kicks.\" \"Don't have to. Your mouth did it for me.\" Terra giggled a bit as Tod got out of the water with Terra then noticing his paw turning blue. This made her a bit cautious since it was the first time she'd seen this. \"I don't know what kind of warning that gives though.\" Tod becomes confused and looks at his paw surprised to have seen it turn blue. \"Strange. I don't know what it could mean either.\" A drop of water fell from Tod's paw; it amazed both him and Terra, as they never saw anything like this before. When Tod's paw turned back to normal, he looked at Terra and the two of them nodded. They then ran off to see if Jake knew anything about this. Scene cuts to Tod and Terra explaining what happened in the forest to Jake. \"So then my paw turned blue and water started to drip from it.\" Tod explained. \"We only saw one drop of course, since it turned back to normal right after. But it was still really something.\" \"Since you adopted Tod five years ago, we thought you'd know something.\" Terra added, with Jake taking an interest in the story that he'd just heard from them. Jake turned over to his computer since he was sitting on a chair and looked something up. This was about Tod's power, which he learned about a while back sometime after he first allowed Tod to stay with him. \"I actually noticed something like this a while back, sometime when Tod was four or five.\" Tod remembered something that linked to what Jake just mentioned. \"Apparently Tod's a special kind of fox that can use his power for two different elements.\" The elements Jake refered to appeared on the screen. \"Wind and water.\" Tod and Terra became intrigued by this as Tod then questioned why this didn't happen sooner. \"I remember that one time when I looked out the window for the first time.\" Tod flashbacked to the exact event he mentioned. \"When I reached my paw outside, the wind started flowing around it and created an orb of air. But it vanished before I could show it to anyone. Probably a good thing though. Who knows what it could've turned into.\" The flashback ended with Terra wondering if she and Tyler had any powers like this. \"So you have awesome elemental powers then? I sure hope me and Tyler have some too.\" \"Maybe you do. From what I know all three of you have exclusive elements.\" Jake explained. \"There's one more part of this one prophecy I found, but it got stashed away in my bookshelf a long time ago, so I don't remember what it is.\" Tod and Terra found this information to be exceptionally interesting, wondering what they could do with these powers. Scene cuts to Tyler writing in a book of some sorts outside as he thinks about what he could put into it. 'Not much has happened since I learned about our parents with my siblings.' Tyler came up with a suggestion and wrote it down. 'Maybe I could write down about what Tod told me about the other day. Hopefully Copper won't mind, since I don't intend on publishing it for a while now.' Tyler saw Tod and Terra walking up to him and was more than happy to greet them. \"Hey guys. Enjoy your little game back there?\" \"It was fun while it lasted.\" Tod remarked, with Terra nodding in agreement. \"We actually found out something really cool when we went to the forest.\" \"Tod has these really cool water powers that can make water drop from his paw.\" Tyler seems a bit confused by this until he remembers something he read once. \"I'm guessing you've read about this before.\" \"Just a bit of it.\" Tyler stood up and walked ahead of his siblings. \"Cmon.\" Tyler ran off to his and Terra's room with his siblings following. Scene cuts to Tyler looking through his bookshelf, which he brought in when he and Terra moved in, looking for something that was on it. Tyler searched for a bit until he eventually found the correct bookshelf case. When he pulled it out, it had a lot of dust on it, indicating that it had been a while since he'd read the book. He blew on it to get the dust off, which blew over to his siblings and made them cough. This led to one of Tod's usual sassy remarks. \"Who wrote this book, the dust bunnies?\" Tyler shrugged and opened up the book, which showed the powers he and his siblings could learn. He then flipped on over to the page that showed this. \"In a form of irony, sometime after Vixey showed us that book about our parents, I saw this book while walking around town and coming across the bookstore I go to every now and then.\" \"Who needs books when you have sports and video games?\" Terra asked. \"As in, stuff that you don't need as much effort to do. Books always make you read them to the highest context and everything.\" \"Books are considered more relaxing Terra.\" Tyler answered as he then showed Tod and Terra the page he went to. \"This one seems to state the powers we can all use and they're exclusive to us. The calmest gets light and nature, the feisty one gets fire and earth, and the purest gets light and water.\" Tod took an interest to him being called the purest, wondering what it could lead to for the future. Scene cuts to Copper trying to howl for Amos but failing to do so as Tod hid in a bush. Copper continued to attempt at howling but kept on failing, with Amos starting to get strict with him. \"Copper, I'm not playing games here.\" Tod felt bad for Copper and decided to give him a little boost. He swiftly used his paw to hit his tail swiftly, making Copper let out a powerful howl that made Chief fall back. This led to Chief shooting his shotgun in the air and having an apple land on his head. He then chuckled a bit as he praised Copper for his accomplishment. \"Well done there Copper. I've never seen anything like that out of you.\" Chief smelled something burning and signaled Copper that he'd be right back. He then ran off after Copper nodded and then he looked to see Tod pop out from a bush. \"Hunting practice?\" \"Yep. Thanks for the save there.\" Copper replied, grateful for Tod's painful, but helpful assistance. \"If you weren't there I'd probably dissapoint Chief big time.\" Tod noticed a sense of concern in Copper's voice and figured that showing him his new power would make him feel better. \"You wanna come see something?\" Copper became interested in hearing this and followed Tod to the forest, with Chief noticing this from the barn. While he was now less aggressive with Tod when he ran off with Copper, he didn't like Copper skipping out on hunting practice. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper near the pond with Tod getting ready to show Copper his new power. \"I just found out that I had this power, but if I try hard enough then I think I can get it to work.\" Copper nodded as Tod placed his paw into the water, lifting it up right after and finding that there was no water orb. Being a bit surprised, he put it back in and waited a bit longer. \"Maybe it takes more time.\" Tod takes his paw out of the water again and finds no water orb, gaining a blunt look from it. \"Really.\" Copper became confused about what Tod was trying to show him, not exactly understanding what he was trying to do. \"Is the power putting your paw into the water a bunch?\" \"No, there's supposed to be a water orb.\" Tod explained, and he then looked at Copper once he continued. \"If I can master this power then maybe we can get closer to stopping Signal. Only problem is that it came at random when I was playing with Terra, so it could be anything that causes it.\" Copper looked into the water with Tod wondering if there was a limit. \"Maybe it's one use per day.\" \"I doubt it.\" Copper replied. \"If the power was THAT lame they wouldn't have even implumented it.\" Tod nodded in agreement, seeing Copper's point. \"I don't really know how this works, but what I DO know is that they'd obviously let you use it again if you had to. It's like, the law.\" Tod started thinking about his chances of beating Signal, knowing that his combat skills alone weren't enough. Despite the dojo being a great help for him, Copper, and his siblings, he felt as if he wasn't able to get to the strength that he needed in order to win. He knew it was important to finish the prophecy, but he couldn't master this skill straight away. This alone frustrated him. \"If that's true then it'd better not be a spoiled brat.\" Scene cuts to Terra trying walking through the forest to find a good place to try and learn her earth powers. 'Let's see here. Jake said one of my powers was earth. And since we don't have any fire nearby, I think it's best to try that one.' Terra walked through the forest some more as she then came over to what looked like an open area. It had rocks and everything, which was perfect for Terra's training. When she went to walk over to it however, she was caught of guard by a bear trap, which she pulled her paw away from just in time before it snapped. 'Some people just don't understand that blood could kill the taste of a bear.' Terra jumped onto a tree and then jumped to another one, continuing this process until she got to the rocks. When she did get to the rocks, she walked up to one and placed her paw against it, wondering what she has to do. \"Alright earth powers. However you work, do your stuff.\" Terra tried to use her earth powers, but couldn't exactly pull it off due to not knowing how they worked. After waiting for about ten seconds, she got fed up and kicked the ground in frustration. The ground Terra kicked suddenly made the ground rise behind her, making her turn around and see it for herself. She was amazed at what she just did, wanting to see more. \"Awesome!\" Terra climbed up tot he top of the rock and stopped at the point, feeling the rock and finding it to be very sturdy. \"And it's hard too. I can surround loads of baddies with a power like this in my arsenal.\" Terra ran off to tell Tod and Tyler about her power discovery, hoping that she could demonstrate it intentionally when she did. Scene cuts to Tyler sitting over a cliff of some sorts, seeming to be trying to discover his wind power. Tyler raised his paw calmly in front of him and waited for a wind orb to come along. Being that it was the most common form of use, he figured that it'd be a good place to start to unlocking his powers. Since Tyler was the most patient of his silbings, he didn't have much of a problem with waiting. Despite this, he didn't seem to be making any progress. After about twenty seconds of the edges of the cliff being shown around him and the sun being shown in one clip, he put his paw down and started to wonder what else he could do. \"Maybe it involves more life risking challenges.\" Tyler sensed something and looked back to see a fox like figure. Since he only knew three foxes in his entire life, and two of them were his siblings, he didn't have much caution when he walked up to the figure. And he was right to be as calm as he was, as it was just Vixey studying some oddly colored tree bark. Vixey saw Tyler and smiled as she put her stuff away. \"Ah, hey Tyler. Fancy seeing you around here. Usually it's Tod that comes to pay me a visit, if at all anyway.\" \"I'm actually out here testing out these powers I heard I had.\" Tyler explained, with Vixey becoming excited when she heard it. \"See, I heard the calmest of the siblings was given the skills of wind and nature. I don't know how they work yet, but a part of me feels like I'll get there.\" Vixey takes out a book of some sorts and looks through it, finding a page that shows Tyler using his wind powers. \"Maybe even sooner than you expect.\" Vixey showed Tyler a picture of what she was talking about with Tyler becoming intrigued by it. \"It's not much, but it does show a glimpse of what your powers will be like. I don't think you'll be dissapointed in this regard.\" \"What regard?\" Tod asked as he popped down from underneath a tree. Copper then came along as he jumped down. \"Also, cannonballs don't make good water power makers.\" \"Neither do rocks.\" Terra added in once she frontflipped over them. \"I did find something else that made some use to me though.\" \"Well you guys can tell me all about it back at my home.\" Vixey walked past the others and signaled them to follow her, which they did, with Tod and Copper being the only ones who knew about what Vixey's place was all about. Scene cuts to Tod and the others at Vixey's place with Tyler admiring the crystal coating. Tyler touched the crystal coating and found the feel and look of it to be a spectecle. \"Phenomenal.\" Tyler saw Vixey's bookcase and was amazed at all the books she had on it, walking over to it and admiring them. \"There's gotta be at least three hundred sixty five books here!\" \"Lucky guess.\" Vixey replied as she walked in, grabbing the book she had on Tod, Terra, and Tyler. \"Also, quick little note, I think the fourth magical being is Copper.\" Tod was eating a tamale with Copper looking to see fifty more right next to it. He questioned how Tod would be able to eat them all, considering what mexican food did to people. \"Good thing we don't share a room.\" \"Heh. No kidding.\" Tod smacked down on another tamale and licked his fingers, sighing of relief upon the taste of it. \"Actually, I don't share a room with anyone. (Looks at the audience) Not that you needed that clarification of course.\" Terra was shown to be in a room that we've never seen before, with ruby coated weights and everything as she counted the while using dumbell she was lifting. \"One hundred and seventy five, one hundred and seventy six, one hundred and seventy seven, one hundred and seventy eight, one hundred and seventy nine, one hundred and eighty.\" Terra put the dumbell down and punched her palm, walking back over to the others afterwards. Tod was still eating the tamales with Vixey walking up to him, amazed at how big his appetite could be. Once Tod ate his eightieth tamale, Vixey commented on how he could eat so much. \"I've never seen anyone your size eat as much as you do Tod.\" \"There are some anime characters that could eat as much as me.\" Tod replied. \"Goku from Dragon Ball, Kion from The Legend of Kion, Orion from Ginga Hanashi Orion, there are plenty of them out there.\" Tod continued eating the tamales with Vixey noticing that Tod is more than capable of holding in his gas. Well, at least from the backside, as Tod then released a loud burp. The young fox patted his belly, which surprisingly enough didn't get much bigger. Despite this, Vixey then pulled the tamales away, which led to Tod whining a bit. \"Hey.\" \"Oh stop whining, would you?\" Vixey replied as she put the tamales away. \"Eat enough of these and you could get diabetes.\" Tod scoffed with a smirk, feeling like he could eat plenty more of those things. \"I could eat two hundred of those and not get diabetes. I actually did that for pizza one time.\" Vixey raised an eyebrow right before Tod finished. \"All the slices.\" Vixey nodded with amazement as Copper appeared to be baffled by the amount of food Tod could eat. \"It's something that I've been doing for five years now. Jake really knows how to fill up my stomach.\" \"Now all he's gotta do is find a way to where it doesn't make out with your butt.\" Copper joked, with Tod chuckling nervously as he scratched the back of his head. \"Speaking of other stuff actually, we came here to learn about the powers Tod told me he and his siblings had, right?\" \"That's right.\" Vixey replied with a nod. \"Tyler's already in the library, and Terra should be done in the training room.\" Tod and Copper got up and walked off with Vixey as Tod looked at her with a smile of amazement. Copper was confused by this but shrugged as he decided to just brush it off. Tod and the others were all gathered up at the table with Vixey opening up the book on the powers Tod, Terra, and Vixey represent. Vixey looked at the powers Tod had and was more than excited to share this knowledge. \"You really are lucky Tod. Wind and water can make mini hurricanes, which mess with the enemies full circle. (Laughs) I'd just love to see their faces with that one.\" Vixey laughed a bit more as Tod got a look at the page she was looking at, taking a liking to what it showed from his perspective. \"So this is what we can do then.\" Tod looked to see a giant hurricane that seemed to be destroying everything in sight. He didn't know what to make of it, since he wasn't all that fond of destruction. \"That's one power I hope I don't end up abusing.\" Vixey looked at what Tod was pointing too with Copper getting a look at it as well. \"If that gets too far out of hand, I could kill everything.\" \"Yeah, I wouldn't wanna be in the middle of that.\" Copper added in, hoping that Tod wouldn't have to use the power at all. \"I mean, I'm all about getting wet, but that'd be the last thing I'd wanna do.\" \"Pssh. Barf that.\" Terra then walked over to them and grabbed the book as Tyler walked over as well. \"Let me see MY powers.\" Terra got a look at her powers and saw a volcano like fire rising from her paw. This was something that she couldn't help but find insane. \"Awesome! I'm totally using that on Signal; there's no excuse not to!\" Tyler looked at the page next to Terra's and saw a power that showed a light beam with leaves surrounding it. \"My power doesn't seem as huge as either of yours, but it could still be effective. After all the biggest matter is the impact.\" \"Precisely.\" Vixey replied as she then thought about seeing the powers for herself. \"It would just be an incredible moment indeed to see them all in action. I heard they give this huge attack that could destroy all evil, but it's never been used before because the final figure was never found.\" Tod took an interest in that information, wanting to know more about how it worked. Scene cuts to Kevin playing on his console as he's then shown playing some kind of hack n slash. Kevin kept on trying to beat all the enemies but couldn't seem to beat them, and this continued onward once Tod knocked on the door. \"It's open!\" Tod opens the door and Kevin groans at the fact that he just died. \"Whatever! This game cheats anyway!\" Kevin throws his controller aside with Tod catching it and walking over to him with Copper. \"I guess you guys now know how I feel about Pyro Shall Scorch, or at least the third game. I love it, but I can hardly do anything because it's so hard that my eyes almost bawl out from it.\" Tod took a look at the level Kevin was playing and decided to give it a go. \"Lair of Kidemokrasia? Dude, I beat this level twice now.\" Tod started playing the level and Kevin then started talking with Copper. \"So we learned about some of Tod's powers today.\" Copper said, filling Kevin in on what they did today. \"There's this one that can even create a hurricane that destroys everything. I wonder if it could also destroy people's insides.\" \"Well if it can destroy everything then it can obviously destroy your insides.\" Kevin pointed out, leaving Copper to think about those words. \"Still, that's a hurricane I'd pretty much be forced to come along with, since I plan on joining Tod and the other members of his gang on their adventures. That's something I'd rather die than not see with my own eyes.\" Tod finished the level and handed Kevin the controller, which Kevin greatly appriciated. \"Thanks loser. Oh, and I got those sodas you like.\" Tod and Copper both hi fived Kevin and walked over to the fridge, opening it up as Copper asked Tod a question. \"So what do you think your powers would look like to your family?\" Tod flinched upon that question, thinking about his mother for a bit when he heard it. \"I don't know Copper.\" Tod and Copper grabbed their sodas and walked back over to where Kevin is, with Copper noticing Tod's expression as they left. Kevin found this level to be easier than the last with his expression of being less stressed out. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin chilling out in Kevin's room as Kevin looks up something on his laptop. Tod noticed a building on Kevin's laptop that looked familiar. He recognized it from a book he read on London in his history class. Although he couldn't tell why Kevin was looking it up, he walked over to him to see what was up with Copper joining him. \"Hey Kevin, why're you looking up the Shard?\" \"Well Tod, some people say that it's just a glass tower.\" Kevin explained, having a theory in mind. \"But in reality, it's a super secret tower that I'm going to discover the source of, even if I have to kick the place down. Which would cause a lot of blood, but still.\" Tod found this intriguing as Copper then remembered something in his house. \"Hey, Amos has this scratch ticket that lets him choose a ticket to a free place. He hasn't used it yet and maybe if we use it ourselves, we can use the tickets to get to London and find more information on Tod's powers.\" \"You mean steal it?\" Kevin asked, with him then realizing what Copper meant. \"Oh, wait, now I get it. Terrible idea dude, he'd never give it to us.\" Copper shrugged, feeling that it was at least worth a try. Scene cuts to Tod, Copper, and Kevin sneaking around behind Amos's house as Copper then nods to Tod and Kevin. \"Alright guys. Now I'll go in there and try to get the ticket, and hopefully we'll be able to get the amount of tickets we need to get to London.\" Copper explained, hoping he could help Tod find more information about his family. \"Since I'm the only one that both Amos and Chief trust, I'll be the best one to go in and see if I can get it. One wrong move from anyone and it's all over. Or we just need a plan B. Or maybe a plan something.\" \"Just get the ticket dude.\" Tod replied with a friendly arm punch, with Copper smiling and nodding as he headed off. Copper walked up to the porch and looked inside to see Amos watching Tv. Not wanting to get caught too easily, he opened the window and then hid. This caught Amos's attention, so he walked over to the window to close it. Little did he know however that a little Bloodhound had just snuck in through the doggie door. Copper hid underneath the couch and kept himself out of Amos's sight, which he was able to do until he felt his bladder about to burst. Copper tried to hold in his wimpers as he then reached for the ticket. Since Amos was into his hunting show, he didn't see it, but then Copper started peeing. He face palmed silently as he thought to himself. 'I knew I shouldn't have drunk all that soda the other night.' Copper finished after about ten seconds and climbed out the window behind the couch, which was already opened. This was when Amos noticed the pee and got frustrated. \"Dang nabit Copper! This is why we gotta get you house trained!\" Copper showed Tod and Kevin the ticket and all three of them hi fived, running off with Tod stopping for a bit to look back at Amos. The hunter noticed the red fox as the camera then panned to Tod's butt, allowing him to shake it at Amos and blow a raspberry at him, showing his childlike sass. Tod then ran off with Amos closing the window in anger, knowing he'd get Tod someday. Vixey was then shown spying on the three with a soft giggle as the screen faded to black, ending the episode off. Light guitar music plays during the credits as Tod is seen walking through the forest. A female voice prepared to sing My mother as Tod looked at the ground in a sorrow mood once the song began, showing Tod's struggle with his mother's death and his new life. \"As much as I love my life there are truths that I can't deny.\" Tod passed over some shadows of Signal and her minions confronting him. \"If I hadn't seen my mother die then time could just fly by.\" Tod then saw a vision of Signal attempting to kill him, sending fear down his spine. \"But even with all of this in my mind and all of this known pain.\" Tod tried to shake off the memory, not letting it get to him. \"If I just let it affect me then there's nothing to gain.\" Copper was seen walking through the forest with a rather upset look on his face, struggling to find who he was as the song continued from another female singer. \"And even with these thoughts in mind and all that I can see.\" Copper looked up to the sky, having images of Chief teaching him how to hunt. \"Deep down inside my heart I just don't know what I want to be.\" Copper looked at the rabbit doll in the clouds above, not wanting to hurt it. \"I know they're trying to help me but I don't want this life.\" Copper looked on ahead with confusion in his eyes. \"And although I'm grateful for their support inside I have this strife.\" Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest together, both confused as the song continued with both female singers. \"Both of these memories from within show how we struggle with our lives.\" Tod arrived at a hill as he looked over it, holding back his tears of pain. \"The loss of grief and choice of life show how which one of us survives.\" Tod looked to see Copper next to him, both having similar pain. \"But even with this thought inside me I won't let it be a bother.\" Tod smiled and scooted closer to Copper, wrapping his arm around him. \"Cause us best friends won't ever want to try to hurt each other.\" Copper smiled upon the comfort of Tod, both of them looking over the hill as these last lyrics were sang, as well as them appearing on the screen from the first singer. \"I will get the proudness deserved from and by my mother.\"[Chapter 8] The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy Season one Episode eight: Mystical Foxes in London Anime rock music played during the credits as the song Prophecy was heard while a male singer was heard. Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest as a male started singing. \"This is the power of my friends, and family with it.\" Tod and Copper jumped into a pond and started splashing one another along with a wolf cub. \"Even if it's not all that simple and has hard stuff to fit.\" Terra was seen at the top of a tree as she jumped from the highest branch. \"I know there's more to me than being a simple kid.\" Terra cannonballed into the pond, splashing Tyler, who was seen tuning his guitar. \"But for my siblings life, that's nothing that I'd bid.\" Tyler jumped into the pool and Vixey popped up next to Tod, making the fox kit blush and smile while rubbing his arm. \"It's complicated, but I don't care. My life may just flash like a flare.\" Tod and the others were seen punching, kicking, and biting Signal's minions. \"But as long as you're here I could care less!\" Jake was seen slashing the robots in half with a sword. \"Even if I die today!\" Signal's eyes were shown with a dark glow. \"It'll be a noble decay!\" Tod and Signal were seen punching and kicking one another in the air. \"My family's not something I'd give up so easily!\" Tod shot a bullet at Signal, who deflected it right back at Tod and his him in the knee. \"My friends and family, are important to me!\" Tod sneered at Signal and managed to charge at her. \"And I will find the truth in the prophecy!\" Tod glowed a bright red color and then he aimed a punch at Signal upon the final lyrics. \"That's right, I will find the truth in the prophecy.\" Tod and the others were seen going onto the title screen, with Tod front flipping onto the screen next to Copper, being adventurous and optimistic, Copper being kind and timid, Terra skateboarding onto the screen with tsundere feistiness and playfulness, Tyler tuning his guitar and giving a peace sign to the audience with care and calmness, the wolf kicking down the door and flipping off the audience, showing his cocky and selfish side, Vixey showing her bookworm and researcher side when walking on screen, and Jake slashing through the wall and jumping on with the others, and then The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy appeared behind them. Scene cuts to a plane flying over the seas with Tod then seen playing on some kind of gameboy in a seat by the window. Copper got a look at what Tod was playing on wondering what game he was playing on it. It was a 2dsxl after all, and that was the latest portable console on the market. Tod noticed Copper curiosity and was more than happy to show him the game he was playing. \"Fire Shall Scorch: Invasion of the Porta Potties.\" Copper snickered a bit upon the name of that game, getting the joke that the creators were going for. \"Yep. It's a good one. I actually started laughing my butt off when I first heard about it. Well, being that I was three at the time and all.\" \"Well it's deffinetely a joke worth making dude.\" Copper snickered again, wanting to play the game himself. \"You think they have consoles and games like that someplace in London?\" \"Maybe. What kind of country DOESN'T have video games?\" Tod continued to play his game with Copper then thinking about how much fun he'd have in London with Tod and the others. He never left the country he lived in before, so it was a huge opportunity for him. \"It's gonna be a blast there Copper. (Copper looks at Tod) I can only imagine how much fun we'll have there.\" Copper nods in agreement having similar thoughts to Tod as he then leaned back in his chair. \"Yeah. It should be a fun time.\" Just then, a foul oder caught Tod's sense of smell with him sniffing a bit to find the scent of bacon near them. Tod gave a smirk to Copper who giggled as he sat back up. \"Sorry.\" Tod looked at the audience as he explained his excitement to them. \"It really is super exciting that I finally get to meet my dad. I honestly didn't even know I'd get to see him again one day, but here we are sneaking off to London. I can't wait to see what's improved, it's all gonna be so cool.\" Copper waved to the audience as the camera panned to him, wanting to greet them himself. Scene cuts to Tod and the others still flying with Terra seeing a castle that looked like the one in the book Vixey showed them. \"So that's the castle of London.\" Terra sat down, wondering what the castle had in store for her. \"You think they have a basketball court there? (Looks at Kevin) I have to practice my skills as much as possible or else I'll lose all my mojo.\" \"Why not? London's supposed to have everything. Even that crabby reviewer who likes to overreact to everything.\" Kevin pulled out his phone and looked up a video called Gracecun15. \"I don't think it would take a detective to find out what the creator of this video meant by the name of it, but (Shows Terra the video) you'll find a lot to hate about this chick. Terra started the video, which started off with a london girl in it ranting on someone while tearing down her room. \"How dare this bloody reject say Bunga isn't a bad character!? He dare to say he's okay! I despise that annoying squat and would rather die than call him a good character! And I for one wish to remian a biased air-head who despises the user known as Sonicbronyuniversez and act like a hypocritical swine for all my life! I'm an egotistical jerkwad who thinks she's perfect in every way shape and form and would rather die than admit my mistakes!\" Terra stopped the video and handed Kevin her phone back, not knowing how someone can be so biased and hostile. \"She clearly doesn't know the definition of the word opinion, let alone the definition of sanity.\" Kevin nodded in agreement, finding the girl in the video just as grating as she did. \"I heard she was so annoying that the creators of Youtube didn't even care that it was an attack on her.\" Tyler pointed out as he looked over at Terra and Kevin from his seat. \"Just goes to show how someone can be. She even had a falling out with Sonicbronyuniversez because she overreacted to him simply trying to call her out for being a massive jerk to one of his friends.\" Terra and Kevin took interest in that information with Terra commenting on it. \"Exactly, where does this girl live?\" Tyler started to worry about what Terra was thinking of, not wanting to get involved. Scene cuts to Tod and the others exiting the plane and getting a view of London. Tod was amazed by what he saw, giving off his bubbly personality with his wide smile and amazed look. The beauty of London was shown to them all, with Copper standing next to Tod and being just as amazed as he was. Jake took out a watch and left a timer for when to meet at the tower, wanting everyone to have their fun. Everyone got the memo and nodded with Tod and Copper running off. The two of them started searching the town and found it to be a wonderful sight indeed. Tod saw a food stand and found it near impossible to resist. Kevin was seen dragging a bunch of water baloons over to a ladder he saw with Terra seeing this and becoming intrigued. She walked over to Kevin and helped him get the bag up, climbing up with him to see what was up. When they got up there, Kevin took out a water baloon and gave Terra the idea of what he was going to do. Kevin offered Terra a water baloon, which she accepted after a couple seconds of thinking. Vixey was looking around as she reimagined her life in London. She didn't know how to take in being back after so much time being gone. She saw Tyler adapting really well as she saw him looking at some kind of light music sign up sheet. As she looked at Jake, she saw him looking at some weapons, which she assumed were for any upcoming attack against Signal. She was so relieved to be back in London, and she just couldn't wait to have the time that her return deserved. She just needed to know where to start. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper talking about stuff as they walk to the castle with the others. \"So how do you think Amos is gonna be when he realizes that the ticket he won is gone?\" Tod asked Copper, feeling that he can handle anything Chief threw at him. \"Cause I have a feeling he won't be able to stop me next time.\" \"Well keep in mind that I'm the one who stole it.\" Copper reminded Tod, who nodded in understanding. \"I'm just worried he'll do something worse than his other stuff. I also peed on the floor ya know.\" The King fox from the book Vixey had was walking around the castle as he heard Tod's voice from outside. \"Yeah, but that's all subjective.\" Daniel looked outside and was amazed to sense the same aura from his second born son that he did before Maria left with them. \"And it's not like he's not gonna get over it. He doesn't need money to do what he does; he kills animals for a living.\" Daniel was overjoyed to see his children again, wanting to see them as soon as possible. He pulled out his phone and gave someone a call. \"Drake, they're back. They've finally returned!\" Scene cuts to Tod noticing a rather concerned look on Vixey as they were walking around the castle. \"You okay Vixey?\" Vixey looked at Tod and noticed his concerned look, hoping she wasn't worrying him too much. \"I just noticed you were looking concerned and I wanted to know if everything was okay. I know how hard it must be-\" Just then a bunch of guards ended up appearing out of nowhere and surrounding Tod and the others, who were more than cuatious when seeing them. \"Well this was a shocker.\" Jake pulled out his sword and clashed with one of the guards, who got kicked back by him and then Jake pinned him against the wall with his foot. \"Speak up before I cut his head off.\" The leader of the guards takes a liking to the power Jake possesses and walks up to him. \"Brilliant skill young one. Few have been able to face the power of our guards.\" Tod found that hard to believe considering how easily Jake took down the guard he fought. \"Now then. Allow us to explain our business. We're the guards of Maria and Damien, as you already know. Damien wishes to see you in his throne room.\" Tod perked up and walked up to the guard leader, wondering what he could be speaking of. \"Wait. You mean my father?\" The guard nodded his head yes with Tod getting excited and jittery inside. Scene cuts to Damien waiting in his throne room for Tod and the others to come forth. Damien seemed to take a liking to Tod in particular, sensing a pure and energetic heart coming from him. He knew that at least one of his children would have the energy of his wife, and he seems to have found him. As he walked down the steps, he kneeled down to Tod and smiled at him as he spoke. \"We finally meet my child.\" Tod and the others were surprised by this response as Damien then stood tall and held his sword down to Tod's forehead. \"The pureness you hold from within you will be more than enough to take down the demon known as Signal.\" Tod was unaware of who this Signal character was, not knowing much about her aside from maybe getting a few hints in the past. \"You mean that crazy lady that took over this place and made everyone into her slave.\" Damien put his sword away as he then reassured Tod he could defeat Signal. \"Well, yes, but now that you three are in the picture, she won't stand a chance against us.\" Damien looked at his sword and saw the shine in it as it glimmered up. \"I'm sure you three are aware of your elements by now. (Looks at Vixey with a strict look) Assuming Vixey still has the book she stole from the castle library.\" Tod and the others looked at Vixey with a surprised look with Vixey giggling a bit as she then confirmed this information. \"I'm honestly surprised you didn't send a search squad after me. That book was pretty valuable.\" \"Time would pass young one.\" Damien replied with a chuckle as he then looked at the Copper, taking an interest in the Bloodhound puppy. \"You. You look familiar.\" Copper didn't seem to get what Damien was getting at, and not just due to his air-headed nature. He felt a bit off upon hearing this. That said, he was more than willing to reply with a kind voice. \"Well I don't know what the heck you mean by that, but whatever it is I'm sure it's good.\" Damien nodded in agreement, feeling a similar shine from Copper as he did for Tod. \"Perhaps young one. After all, you and Tod have the same aura of pureness within you. (Points to his sword) The sword of pureness never lies.\" Tod and Copper looked at each other in awe, wondering what this could lead to. Scene cuts to Tod jumping up and down on a bed of sorts with his excitement showing full circle. \"It's so awesome that I finally got to meet you dad!\" Tod exclaimed with Damien being rather fond of his bubbly personality. \"I can see us joining in battle right now; we're gonna be the bet father son duo in the whole world! No one will get in our way!\" Jake was playing some sort of game on his laptop as he got a look at Tod while he was speaking to his father, liking that he was able to finally see him. \"I just can't believe after five years I finally got to meet you for the first time. And hey, now I'm old enough to actually remember you.\" Damien chuckled softly at Tod's waves of personality as he then looked down to see Terra pinning down one of the guards, impressed by the physical capabilities she was showing. \"I'm guessing Terra would be joining us in the battle.\" Tod jumped of the bed once Damien pointed to where Terra was outside, noticing how well she was handling the guards. \"She seems to have amazing physical capabilities. She'd do well in the upcoming tournament.\" Tod became surprised to hear a mention of a tournament, having never heard about it until now. \"There's a tournament? What's it about? Well, aside from fighting of course, cause it's pretty obvious from why you brought it up.\" \"Well Tod, the point of the tournament is to see everyone's capabilities in both strength, and intelligence to see how well they'll do in the battle against Signal.\" Damien explained as he rubbed Tod's head. \"I feel you'd do really well in this battle as well. You seem to be one that's willing to save everyone.\" \"Yeah, you could say that.\" Tod replied as he then said something that surprised Damien quite a bit. \"But honestly, I don't see that as a goal. It's more like a challenge.\" Damien found Tod to be an interesting child indeed, seeing as he was willing to fight Crystal for both his friends, and for fun. \"I wish we could keep away from the fighting though. But hey. What can you do?\" Damien nodded and walked off to leave Tod to do his own thing. \"The tournament will be in five days. Feel free to train until then.\" After hearing those words from his father, Tod nodded and smiled as he got ready for some excitement. Scene cuts to Tod and Copper training on the roof as Copper aimed a roundhouse kick at Tod, who blocked it and knocked him back with a punch. Copper regained his balance with Tod then lunging at him and pinning him down, making Copper worried about what Tod was about to do. \"Go ahead Copper. Try to get me off of you. If you can anyway.\" Copper smirked and pushed Tod off of him, allowing Tod to roll back and get back into his fighting stance. The two of them then charged at each other and collided punches and kicks. Copper managed to land a punch on Tod's face, only for Tod to grab Copper's arm and throw him onto the ground, pinning him to the floor with ease. \"Easy as pie.\" Copper licked his lips as he thought about the taste of pie. \"I like pie.\" Tod suddenly sat down on Copper's face, surprising him as he then closed his eyes as he then became confused as to what Tod was doing. As Tod allowed his stomach to growl, he grunted and ripped a five second rotten egg fart, surrounding Copper's face with a yellow cloud (brrrrrrrrrruuuuuuuuuup). Copper then coughed and wafted the fart away with Tod whiffing the scent with proudness. Tod helped Copper waft the fart away and explained his reasoning for doing that. \"That's what we'll have to prepare for in the tournament. If we're not careful then we'll get caught of guard by some kind of dirty trick.\" Copper nodded with understanding as Tod then assured Copper on something else. \"Just keep in mind that my butt won't be my main line of offense.\" Copper nodded and both his and Tod's stomachs growled, showing that the two of them were hungry. The two of them giggled and headed off to get some food. Scene cuts to Terra sitting on Kevin in the middle of a bedroom that was surrounded by sports stuff, weaons, and video games. Kevin was gasping for air as Terra made sure her butt was far enough down there, letting her red furred rear end surround it. Kevin then spoke with his word being muffled. \"Please! I'll never say it again! Just get off me!\" \"You said that before.\" Terra stated while cutting a three second cheeseburger fart, hitting Kevin with a green cloud (phhhhht). Kevin gasped for air as Terra smacked her butt with proudness as she then released a five second onion fart (pfffffffffft). Kevin was starting to suffocate from the green clouds with Terra then letting out two more farts that reeked of protein shakes (brrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaat) (bllllllllllaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrp). Kevin then screamed again with Terra stating something else. \"And all five times, it didn't work.\" Terra then felt her stomach growl as she then grunted really hard with this coming out (BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP). Kevin was forced to smell a loud and bassy ten second rotten egg fart that surrounded his whole body with a yellow cloud. When Terra stood up, she looked back at Kevin with her butt being shown as she released a three second protein shake fart as she lifted her leg (pffffft). Kevin ran off with Tod and Copper seeing him run by as they entered the room, covering their noses and gagging from the foul oder. Tod then quickly caught onto what might've happened. \"Kevin call you trickshot again?\" \"Yep.\" Terra replied as she then patted her stomach and smacked her butt right after. \"And these boys were NOT ready to let that fly again. They don't stop after you tell them to, you get them.\" Scene cuts to Kevin groaning from the flatulences he just endured from Terra as he walked up to his bedroom door. Kevin opened up his bedroom door with exhaustion and closed it tight when he walked in, walking over to his bed and climbing up to it. \"Lesson finally learned. Never insult Terra.\" Kevin lied down on his bed as he tried to think of a loophole he could use to throw Terra off guard. \"Maybe I could use it in a more playful tone rather than genuinelly rude.\" Kevin then nodded his head no, feeling that would be too obvious. He then thought about getting some food, despite the flatulences he just faced. \"Maybe Terra's butt has a limit when it comes to eating.\" Kevin got up with Tyler entering the room and getting a whiff of his scent, feeling that it was more than distracting to anyone. \"Geez Kevin, it reeks in here. How long have you not had a bath for?\" \"About six months. So...three months before I met Tod and Copper.\" Kevin replied with Tyler being disgusted by his lack of hygine. \"Your sister also fart tortured me, so that's another thing that could've helped.\" \"Riiiight.\" Tyler rolled his eyes as he said that, knowing his siblings all too well. \"Well I think it's best we get all that stench out. No way you're gonna get anywhere reeking like a graveyard.\" Kevin shrugged and walked off with Tyler, feeling that his idea couldn't be too bad to try out. \"You ever been in a bathtub before?\" Scene cuts to Tyler bathing Kevin as he started putting shampoo on his head with Kevin being familiar with it. \"I always hated this stuff.\" Kevin commented, not being too fond of the requirements to staying clean. \"There was always a chance it'd get into my eyes and I'd probably even get pink eye from it. Then again you can only get that if someone farts into your pillow, so that's probably why I never got it myself.\" Tyler seemed to be baffled by the information Kevin just spouted out, finding it to be completely inaccurate. \"Trust me Kevin. There are other ways to get pink eye.\" Tyler continued to scrub Kevin's head as he then thought about what he was going to do with his powers. Being that he was the one given the light and nature elements, he figured he'd be the most peaceful of the fighters. He then saw a bunch of bubbles coming from the tub, making him look down and give Kevin a blunt look. \"Did you have to fart, or did you just not care.\" \"Latter.\" Kevin replied as Tyler then started clearing out the bathtub with some kind of elixer. It got rid of the stench no problem and even removed any bad scent Kevin had on him. \"Alright, so we got the scent on; can I go eat now?\" \"Just let me conditioner this first.\" Tyler grabbed the conditioner and put some into his paw. \"Gotta make sure that dandruff doesn't come back.\" Kevin gave a blunt look to the audience as Tyler then put conditioner into his hair. Scene cuts to Jake doing some sword practice as he deflected four arrows at once with a spin swing. Jake cut four dummies in half and saw their upper halves fall to the floor, feeling that he was getting the hang of this. \"And they say Link was the only one who could do it. (Looks at his sword) I can certainly (Tosses sword into the air) prove them wrong.\" Jake caught his sword with Daniel entering the room with Jake being more than happy to see him. \"Ah, Daniel. Didn't expect you to come in on such short notice. Or blank notice for that matter. (Puts sword into the handle on his back) Ya need something?\" \"Eh...somewhat.\" Daniel walked up to Jake and seemed concerned, letting Jake know something was up. \"See, I've been meaning to use this opportunity spend some time with my children, and I don't know how to do so without coming off as a greedy anarchic that disowned them for his own personal gain.\" Jake nodded in understanding with Damien then saying something else. \"So I was wondering if you could help me with some ideas. Heck, I don't even care if that Copper kid joins us. He and Tod seem inseparable anyway.\" Jake chuckled and nodded, feeling he could fill Damien in no problem. He kneeled down so he could face his level. \"Well one thing that's mandatory to remember at all times is that Tod is a huge video game player. If he sees a video game he's interested in, he's gonna get it. (Damien nods) Terra's also one you don't wanna make mad and if you do, try to cool her off. Not with water though; that'll make it worse. And for Tyler, just, crack open a good book.\" Damien nodded as he processed all of this information, knowing that it would be useful to him. \"Right. (Jake stands up) Thank you Jake. I'll be more than ready for this information to be used.\" Jake gave a two finger salute with Damien walking off and closing the door behind him. This was when Jake took his sword out and got back to training. Scene cuts to Vixey sitting on a roof with Tod and Copper eating some food out in the hallway. Tod bit into his double cheeseburger when he noticed Vixey seeming conflicted on something. Copper could see as he bit into a chili dog and patted his best friend's back with a supportive smile. \"Go for it Tod. I'll meet you in your room.\" Copper walked off with Tod nodding as he walked out onto the balcony Vixey was standing on. \"You okay Vixey?\" Vixey flinched and looked to see Tod sitting up on the balcony ledge beside her. \"I figured you needed some company. I saw you looking all down and wanted to see what was up.\" Vixey moved her hair back and looked at Tod with concern. He seemed genuinelly caring towards her and she knew he wouldn't make something like this up. She then got ready to say it after taking a deep breath through her nose, and another one out from her mouth. Tod allowed her to do this and waited patiently, knowing this couldn't be rushed. \"My family lives here, and I ran away from them a long time ago.\" Tod became surprised to hear this information and didn't know a lot of what to say. So he decided to just play it casual. \"Wow.\" Tod put his paws together and played with his thumbs as he continued his reply. \"And you're worried that if they see you again, they'll be all crazy about you coming back?\" \"Not entirely, no.\" Vixey admitted as she held back her tears. \"The day I left we got into a huge fight because I found something in that book that could save the world from Signal's wrath. They weren't having it though, and I couldn't take it. I finally found something that could save us all and they just brushed it aside as some bloody tantrum by Gracecun15.\" Tod nodded in understanding, hoping that Vixey would be okay. \"If you don't mind, I'd like to keep the rest vague. At least for the time being.\" Tod nodded and hopped down, knowing that he shouldn't force Vixey to talk about something she doesn't wish to discuss. \"You can do it when you're ready.\" Tod helped Vixey down and walked off with her as she smiled at him, grateful for the time he took to speak with her. For the first time in her life, she felt like she had someone she could speak with unconditionally. Scene cuts to Damien looking at the town map to see what he could do with his children. Damien thought to himself about how he would make himself appeal to each one, not wanting to make anything too hard for them. \"Let's see here. They all have their own personalities and interests, so perhaps I could take them to a place they'll all enjoy.\" Damien looked around and couldn't seem to find a place they'd all be fond of. He wasn't used to spending quality time with his children, especially not after a certain event. He hoped it wouldn't be too hard in the future. \"Of course, it wasn't made to be easy every time.\" Damien considered the possibilities of taking all three children at once. He knew they all had their own unique interests, but he didn't know how they would interact in a place that was more suitable for one child over the other two. \"But I don't think it was always made to be this hard either.\" Damien walked away from the map and thought about how he would be able to balance everything out. \"Maybe I should spend my time with them individually.\" Scene cuts to Copper lying down on Tod's bed as he then gets a call on his phone and takes it out. Copper looked to see that Chief was the one calling him and he almost instantly became stunned to know this. He didn't want Chief to find out about the ticket. Or even then, what if he already knew? Copper couldn't help but answer, hoping Chief wouldn't be as mad as he thought he'd be. From the moment he answered, he replied with a simple word, showing his fear with his shaking body. \"Hello?\" \"Hello Copper.\" Chief replied casually as he spoke in a firm voice. \"Where are you right now?\" Copper flinched and tried to find an excuse to keep Tod out of trouble. Chief kept speaking though, making it even harder. \"You've been gone since yesterday and Amos's ticket is gone. If you're in another country then just say so.\" \"Other country?\" Copper chuckled nervously and hoped Chief wouldn't be able to figure him out. \"No, I'm not in another country. If I was though, I would certainly tell you.\" Copper didn't get a response, making him feel like Chief didn't believe him, since he hadn't hung up yet. \"It's true! I don't know what happened to the ticket. All I know is that I'm still in our country.\" \"So you're still in Paris.\" Chief asked as he then held up a picture of him and Copper in front of the Eiffel Tower. He had fond memories of that day, but he couldn't look back on them now. He had to find out where Copper was. \"Copper, I'm not gonna take this lying crap! If you don't tell me where Tod is then I'm gonna bite his legs off!\" Copper freaked and instantly told Chief where they were. \"We're in London trying to get information on Tod's parents!\" Copper's exclaimtion surprised Chief as Copper then said something else. \"And if you even THINK about hurting Tod, I'll kill you.\" Copper hung up and put his paws on his face with shame. He didn't cry, but he flet the need to cry. Three days later Scene cuts to Tod and Damien at some sort of video game store with Tod excited to be spending time with his father. Tod was looking at all of the video games with stars in his eyes, amazed at what he saw and being his usual bubbly self as he spoke about them. \"They made an exact replica of the one in France.\" Damien put his paw on Tod's shoulder as Tod then grabbed a whole bunch of video games. \"I still can't believe you said I could take as many as I wanted!\" \"Well I had to get you out of the castle somehow.\" Damien joked and then walked over to the counter with Tod to get all the video games he wanted. \"And don't worry about overspending either. I've got enough cash for any amount of games you like.\" Tod smiled with Damien rubbing his head affectionatelly. Chief and Amos were outside the shop as they walked up to the glass. Chief had a vengeful look on his face as the screen faded to black, ending the episode off. Light guitar music plays during the credits as Tod is seen walking through the forest. A female voice prepared to sing My mother as Tod looked at the ground in a sorrow mood once the song began, showing Tod's struggle with his mother's death and his new life. \"As much as I love my life there are truths that I can't deny.\" Tod passed over some shadows of Signal and her minions confronting him. \"If I hadn't seen my mother die then time could just fly by.\" Tod then saw a vision of Signal attempting to kill him, sending fear down his spine. \"But even with all of this in my mind and all of this known pain.\" Tod tried to shake off the memory, not letting it get to him. \"If I just let it affect me then there's nothing to gain.\" Copper was seen walking through the forest with a rather upset look on his face, struggling to find who he was as the song continued from another female singer. \"And even with these thoughts in mind and all that I can see.\" Copper looked up to the sky, having images of Chief teaching him how to hunt. \"Deep down inside my heart I just don't know what I want to be.\" Copper looked at the rabbit doll in the clouds above, not wanting to hurt it. \"I know they're trying to help me but I don't want this life.\" Copper looked on ahead with confusion in his eyes. \"And although I'm grateful for their support inside I have this strife.\" Tod and Copper were seen running through the forest together, both confused as the song continued with both female singers. \"Both of these memories from within show how we struggle with our lives.\" Tod arrived at a hill as he looked over it, holding back his tears of pain. \"The loss of grief and choice of life show how which one of us survives.\" Tod looked to see Copper next to him, both having similar pain. \"But even with this thought inside me I won't let it be a bother.\" Tod smiled and scooted closer to Copper, wrapping his arm around him. \"Cause us best friends won't ever want to try to hurt each other.\" Copper smiled upon the comfort of Tod, both of them looking over the hill as these last lyrics were sung, as well as them appearing on the screen from the first singer. \"I will get the proudness deserved from and by my mother.\" ","Summary":" The fox and the hound: The hidden prophecy Season one Episode one: Unlikely friends Part one A flas"},{"Movie":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang","Title":"Shock","Author":"xgraciela","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5871364","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Perry was between paperwork and another call from his client when the phone rang. He checked the caller's ID - Harry . He sighed and a whole bunch of stupid reasons for the call ran through his head.

From Harry there was always the never ending flow of words even while on the phone. This ability to babble was very annoying, but it was also something stable, which Perry was used to after almost year of their partnership. It also made him smile from time to time, but he would never admit it to anyone starting with Harry. So now the weird silence was more than alarming for him as it could only mean something bad. \"Harry?!\" He asked again, more forcefully this time. Just some accelerated breathing was audible instead of the response. But before Perry could ask or more likely yell again, there was something after all. \"Perry...crash...I...it's...--\" The words continued to flow in the same style for a while and Perry had to try really hard to understand at least some bits. The main feeling for him at the moment was shock and three points - Harry, accident and the name of the street . How he could understand that through the sobbing, he didn't know. But 'Harry' and 'accident' repeated in his head at least ten times, before he started responding - slowly and somewhat gently this time. He had to make sure what happened. That, and if there was any need for Perry to start panicking - not that he was far away from it already and this fact alone was making him nervous. \"Harry? What? What accident? What happened!?\" Even though he tried not to, Perry realized he was sounding very adamantly, but Harry didn't seem to notice. The sobbing only grew louder and no more words came out. That made Perry really worried. \"Harry? Are you crying? Talk to me, okay?\" It sounded as if Harry was trying to respond, but no words came out. Perry had enough. He ran through the apartment, grabbed his jacket, gun - don't ask him why - and car keys, the phone still tucked between his shoulder and ear. \"Harry, I'm coming, okay? Fifteen minutes top. Is there...did someone call the ambulance?\" It was stupid to ask such question, but Perry was a little out of his mind so he didn't care. \"Uh-huh.\" Slurred reply came back and more sobbing followed. \"Fiftee-- Ten minutes, Harry!\" Perry hang up and stormed out of the building, unlocking his car with remote on his keys. Once inside, he decided it was better safe than sorry and called another ambulance for the street of the name which Harry got out of himself earlier. \"What!? Fifteen minutes? You are supposed to help people! Not leave them bleed to death on the fucking street!\" He snapped at the dispatcher roughly. He stopped the flow of his insults abruptly - this wasn't him! When he became such an ass...and wimp? \"I'm sorry. Yeah, I know you are doing your best. Yeah, thank you.\" He ended the call and concentrated on the ride, which wasn't really easy. Crazy images and worst-case scenarios were playing before his eyes. Harry laying on the pavement, bleeding and unconscious. Harry trapped in his car - Perry shouldn't have let him buy it! Harry... \"Fuck!\" He spitted, when one car tried to overtake him. It only made him push the gas pedal lower, maybe even through the ground. Later, he wondered how it was possible that any fucking cop from the neighborhood had attempted to chase him. He almost run through the crossroad at the red light. Cursing like mad when he had to brake all of a sudden, causing the idiot behind him to hoot. Perry wondered if he should let Harmony know. After all, she was Harry's girlfriend - at least he thought so, because he really had no interest in his love life. Or better to say - he tried not to, but just couldn't help it and ended up feeling jealous every time he saw them together. He felt his heart beat faster when he neared the accident site. The blue and red light were visible from a great distance, because the sun was long time gone behind the horizon. Perry thanked the God he didn't believe in for making someone call the ambulance sooner than he did. Police tapes were wrapped around the place and he couldn't see much from his position because of a group of cars, which were waiting here for the street to get unblocked, and a small pack of bystanders between them. He halted sharply and jumped out. Harry's car was nowhere to be seen, but that was the last of Perry's interests right now. He ran towards the nearest ambulance and scanned the surroundings for any signs of blood and dead bodies lying around. \"Hello, I'm--\" He stopped himself, because his P.I. card wouldn't make much sense here. \"That doesn't matter. I'm looking for a...friend. He was probably involved in this accident.\" Perry pointed to nowhere with his right hand, indicating the place around them. He hated that his voice was tight and not very stable. \"Small with black hair?\" The paramedic asked. Perry nodded quickly and felt his throat tighten even more and he really loathed himself at the moment for displaying so many emotions. \"Other ambulance.\" The man pointed to the van standing nearby. \"But it's bad, I'm sorry.\" He threw Perry an apologetic glance, but then continued in his work on the young lady who was sitting on the stretcher and holding her arm tenderly. Perry's heart almost made its way out of his chest on the short way to the second ambulance. It was really dark and he didn't notice the damaged cars on his left. He could see only the other stretcher in front of him and two doctors making sure the person on it would live. A cold shiver ran through his spine when Perry realized that he probably found Harry. \"Sir! You can't be here, sorry!\" One of the paramedics was trying to hold Perry behind the tape. \"But that's my friend!\" He pointed to the stretcher and added, his voice more and more tense, \"He called me before you got there, I need to see him!\" The other man was considering his words for a while and that gave Perry the chance to break free and get nearer to the ambulance and to Harry even though the man started shouting at him only seconds after. Perry didn't listen and stopped a few feet from to the doctors, suddenly afraid to face the truth. tbc As always, thanks for reading![Chapter 2] \"Sir! It's impossible. This one was unconscious long before we arrived, he couldn't have called you.\" The man caught up and laid a hand on Perry's shoulder. \"What? But your colleague over here said...\" Perry pointed back to the other ambulance, but stopped himself, deciding he had to see with his own eyes. Tons of weight flowed away from his chest when he didn't recognize the poor guy who was fighting for his life. 'Thank God' Perry mouthed, but instantly his worries grew again. If this is not Harry, then where is he?! \"You said he'd called you, right?\" Perry nodded quickly and threw a hopeful glance in the other man's direction. \"I think we got him as well.\" He paused but obviously instantly regretted it when he saw the look on Perry's face. \"No, no, no. Don't worry. He's good. We checked him over and there's only a big gash on his temple which would need stitches, but otherwise he seems to be fine.\" He paused again. \"At least physically.\" Perry felt a great relief wash over him, but then frowned uncomprehendingly. \"Come with me.\" The paramedic said and led him to the opposite side of the vehicle. There Perry saw him. Harry was sitting in the open door of the ambulance, hunched and wrapped in a blanket they gave him. He was shivering and tears were still visible on his face. He was looking at nothing and sniffed from time to time. Perry eyed him nervously. \"Harry!\" He approached him slowly, still feeling unbelievably huge relief coursing through his veins. \"He's probably in shock. His car apparently only got mildly struck when the other two crashed together. You can take him for stitching to the hospital yourself if you want. This here--\" The man pointed back to the stretcher. \"will take a bit longer.\" \"Thanks.\" Perry said - not just to be polite - he really meant it. The man nodded and went back to help the doctors. That left Perry and Harry alone. Harry still hadn't responded, but the sobbing seemed to cease. He raised his head as if only registering Perry in that moment. The gash on his forehead was nasty, but the bleeding subsided already. There was a makeshift gauze stuck to it, yet the right side of his face was rather bloody. \"Harry?\" Gently, Perry tried again and smiled lightly. \"Come here...\" He whispered and sat down next to him, crushing him in embrace. Then he waited for some sort of response. Harry just sniffed and scooted closer to him. He must have been still in shock. \"Every grey hair I have is your fault.\" Perry accused him, but his voice was kind. Harry sniffed again and hiccuped. \"Tell me what happened?\" Harry nodded, but no words came out. In different situation, Perry would have laughed at him and call him idiot. Tonight it just wasn't right. \"Okay, what about going to my car? I have to take you to the hospital to get your dim head checked out, chief.\" Perry slipped into his role just for Harry's sake. He needed normalcy now as it seemed and Perry could have sworn that he felt him smile next to his shoulder. \" 'kay.\" Harry snuggled even closer to him. That Perry wasn't used to, but it almost felt nice. Definitely tonight. \"Can you walk?\" Another nod. And the sobbing was less pronounced. They made their way towards the car, ignoring the bystanders who were eying them curiously, because Harry stayed rather glued to Perry's arm and still had the hospital blanket around his shoulders. Perry seated him to the passenger side and buckled him up. \"My car! We have to--\" Harry started once Perry was inside as well. \"Don't worry about it, okay? I'll make sure it gets to the service.\" Harry nodded absentmindedly and started wiping his face with the left sleeve, smearing the half-dried blood all over himself. \"Stop it, that's not a good idea.\" Perry started the car and made an u-turn, heading to the hospital. Harry looked at his - now half-red - sleeve and nodded, looking out of the window stoically. Perry wanted to leave him in peace at least until they would get out of the fucking hospital - third time this month already, not that Perry was counting it. In the waiting room, Perry was feeling nervous again, because Harry had had such a frightened look on his face when the nurse had come to take him to the examination room. But Perry didn't want to explain to her the whole incident and why he should go with his friend inside, so it left him in the waiting area alone and with unpleasant thoughts. When Harry got out, the blanket was away and a neat row of stitches was decorating his temple with a two butterfly band-aids holding it together. It seemed that Harry had been crying again, but probably just from the discomfort before they had numbed the skin. \"The brain still inside?\" Perry joked, but it felt stiff and inappropriate even to him. It seemed to cheer Harry up anyway and made him smile, if only faintly. The ride home was quiet, because Perry was concentrating on not getting them killed and Harry felt asleep from the exhaustion. \"Hey. Good morning!\" Perry woke him up, gently, once at home. Harry seemed disoriented for a while, but apparently everything snapped back in place when his face darkened and a frown formed on his brow. They got inside and Perry seated him on the couch. \"I'm right back, just wait a minute.\" Harry nodded and scratched his arm. Perry reappeared with a big blanket over his hand, a pot of tea and Harry's pajamas - or to be precise a t-shirt and his favorite sweatpants. \"Here, change your clothes. These are ruined.\" Perry pointed to the blood on the sleeve. Harry complied and then seated himself back down. The comfy blanket appeared around his shoulders and then Perry pushed the steaming mug into his hands. \"Drink. It's chamomile - good for nerves.\" He shrugged and waved away Harry's questioning glance. \"I just know it, okay? My mum used to prepare some when I was feeling bad.\" Perry added quietly and sat down. \"It's terrible.\" Harry made a face after the first gulp. \"It won't kill--\" Perry paused, because his own words made him cringe. \"..you.\" He finished through gritted teeth. Harry scooted closer. \"What happened?\" He asked and looked at Perry with his big dark eyes, which seemed still somewhat scared from the bad experience tonight. Perry threw him an amused glance. \"That should be my question, don't you think?\" Harry shrugged again. \"You know what happened to me, but you are acting nice...\" He downed more of the tea with a grimace and continued. \"...and that's weird.\" Perry smiled slightly. \"You scared me, chief. Don't do it again, okay?\" He decided to let it be at this point, because his emotions felt weird enough tonight. Fortunately, Harry seemed to comply. \"I'll try.\" \"But it wasn't my fault!\" He quickly added and Perry was glad that Harry was finally ready to talk about his accident and get it out his system. \"Harry?\" \"Hm..\" \"Tell me what happened.\" Perry wanted so badly to grab him and crush him in embrace once more, but was too scared that Harry would freak out and never talk to him again. Fuck the stupid emotions! So Harry told him. Like he heard the terrible smash and could only watch how the car which was overtaking him crashed into the oncoming vehicle and then the wrack was thrown in Harry's direction, pushing him out of the road. \"Then my car struck the light pole and that's how I got the gash.\" He patted his forehead slightly. \"My head hit the side window and it was half-opened, so..\" He sighed and rested his head on the pillow behind him. \"You really scared me with the call.\" \" 'm sorry.\" Harry mumbled. \"Was just fucking nervous.\" He threw his hands in the air theatrically. \"The car was going to hit me...I knew it...I was just going to Harmony...\" Perry frowned. \"You should let her know.\" Perry hated himself for saying it, but it was for Harry's sake. He checked his watch. \"She's probably waiting for you by now.\" It was Harry's time to frown. \"Why should I tell her? She doesn't wait for me - I just wanted to surprise her. And we're not together.\" He added quickly. \"What? Why didn't you tell me?\" Perry sounded surprised. Harry shook his head. \"I mean, we are not together - together. It's more like friends than together. And I think we've never been more than that. \" It was weird, but after everything what had happened that evening, this made Perry smile and all his weird jealousness vanished. \"You are an idiot, but I'm glad you are in one piece.\" He leaned in and hugged Harry quickly before letting go again. Even though the embrace was fast, it obviously made Harry feel better and conjured a smile on his face. And that was enough for Perry. \"You care for me.\" Harry pointed out a few seconds later, sounding surprised. \"Yeah.\" Perry confirmed more quietly than usual for him. \"Thanks.\" They both felt silent after that, but stayed on the couch for the night. Harry sleeping on Perry's shoulder and Perry feeling more content than he had in years. ~End Thanks for following this! :) ","Summary":" Perry was between paperwork and another call from his client when the phone rang. He checked the ca"},{"Movie":"Reservoir Dogs","Title":"The Horror Of Our Love","Author":"BlaqkHysteria","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7001857","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The Horror Of Our Love . 1. Masquerade The room was full of people; long nightgowns and bowties, top hats and sparkling jewels. Everyone was dancing, except them. They stood by a flight of stairs, waiting on the perfect moment to approach their target. \"Maybe we should dance, y'know, to blend in?\" the man said, smiling charmingly at the woman on his arm. \"There will be no dancing, Vic,\" she dryly answered, without a glance at him. \"I swear, Nicole, this is the last time I help you,\" he snorted. \"Walters went outside for a smoke,\" she noticed, her eyes focused on a man in a grey suit walking in the garden right outside the windows. \"Make sure nobody follows me.\" \"Yes ma'am,\" the man smirked. \"Meet me at the car in ten minutes,\" she whispered in his ear, then stood on her tiptoes and placed a quick kiss on his lips. Left there alone, the man sighed in frustration, and proceeded to get another round of champagne. Nicole crossed the dancing floor quickly, and went out straight into the garden. The dim light was enough for her to spot her target, a few feet ahead of her. She took a cigarette out of her purse, and started to approach him, glancing back at the windows to make sure no one could see them. \"Got a light?\" she asked, smiling. \"Sure,\" the man replied, shamelessly checking her out as he took a lighter out of his breast pocket. \"Thank you,\" she smiled again, then lit her cigarette. The man winked at her, and she struggled with the urge to break his neck. Instead of doing that, she opened her purse again, and pulled out a gun, with a silencer attached to it. The man didn't even notice, busy as he was looking down at her décolleté. He noticed the gun only when Nicole pressed it to his chest. Needless to say, he had no time to say anything. In a few seconds, he was lying dead on the ground. The woman kneeled down and used a napkin to get her fingerprints off his lighter, then put the gun back in her bag. She adjusted her hair and headed straight to Victor's black Cadillac. He was leaning on the hood smoking, but got in the car and started it as soon as he saw her. She got in, and they drove away. \"All good?\" he asked. \"As usual,\" she smiled. \"So, what do you think, a badass yacht or another beach house?\" \"How about Paris?\" \"I have to work, Vic,\" she frowned. \"Yeah, me too, actually. I saw Eddie today, we're doing a job next week.\" \"Another bank?\" \"No, just some drug dealer who owes Joe a fuckload of money.\" \"Nice,\" Nicole dryly commented, not at all impressed. She couldn't understand how Victor managed to do such boring jobs. Not that killing a congressman with a silencer was any more fun, quite the opposite in fact, but that was just a routine gig for her. Most of the time she got to have her way with the victims, and that was fun. The only thing differencing her from a serial killer was that she got paid a shitload of money to kill people. She considered herself an artist, and Victor agreed completely. Her innocent beauty was haunting, even more when she was covered in blood, giving him her perfect million-dollar-smile. She had always been like that, or at least she already was when they met, five years before. He went inside a bank to rob it, and Nicole was there. In a second she managed to kick him in the groin and take his gun, and that had never happened to him before. It turned him on in the weirdest of ways. He always told her that was the exact moment in which he fell in love with her. Nicole smiled a lot, but she never said that kind of things. She thought of love as an infectious and deadly disease, but Victor didn't mind. He knew she loved him, even though she'd never admit it, not even to herself. When he pulled over by their house that night, he noticed something different in her. She got out of the car and opened the front door just like she always did, but there was something in her eyes, something he'd never seen before in them. He could have sworn it was guilt.[Chapter 2] . 2. Expectations \"I'm booked on Friday, Joe, remember?\" Nicole chuckled darkly into the phone, while Victor stared at her from the black leather couch. \"Yes, Sunday works for me… oh, we're framing the husband? Sounds awesome. I get to have some fun finally!\" she cheered. Victor giggled, and she smiled happily at him. Nicole said goodbye to Joe and hung up the phone, then collapsed on the sofa next to her man. Vic put his arm around her neck and pulled her in a heated kiss. \"Vic, baby, you're gonna be late.\" \"Let them wait,\" he whispered in her ear, then proceeded to trail wet kisses down her neck. Nicole leaned into the touch, but then she pulled away, just enough to look him in the eyes. \"Victor,\" she said firmly. The man pulled away from her and sighed. He hated the hint of annoyance in her voice. \"I swear to fucking god, Nicole—\" \"Just go to work.\" \"I'm gonna be gone for three days , and you don't even—\" \"You'll get your fill when you're back, big boy.\" \"That's not what I meant and you know it.\" \"You want me to say that I'll miss you? Want me to sit here like a dog waiting for you?\" she calmly asked. \"You know what? Screw you, Nicky,\" Victor yelled, getting up. He grabbed his coat and headed for the door. \"I'll miss you,\" she spat out. \"You're a sociopath.\" \"I'll miss you,\" she repeated, in the sweetest tone Victor had ever heard. He turned around to look at her, and saw a growing sadness in her eyes. For a second, he thought she might cry. That's just insane, he thought. Nicole looked down at her feet and bit her lip, so he approached her once more and kneeled down in front of her. \"What the hell is wrong with you, babe?\" he asked. \"We should have never met,\" she said in a low voice, looking him dead in the eye. The statement startled Victor, and he didn't say another word as she got up and vanished into their bedroom. \"Nicole?\" Victor called from the hallway, as he closed the door. No answer. \"Baby?\" he called again, and again he got no answer. He looked at his watch. It's four in the morning, where the hell is she? He threw his duffle bag on the couch and started undressing as he made his way to the bathroom. Yawning, he washed his hands then headed for the bedroom to get a good night's sleep. And when he entered the bedroom, Nicole was there. She was sound asleep. Judging by the bottles on the floor, it looked like she drank herself to sleep. Victor shook his head, sighing, and threw away the empty bottles, careful not to make any noise. The woman rolled over in her sleep, and when he looked back at her his mouth fell open. Her right eye was bruised and swollen, as was her cheekbone. She had a gun wound on her biceps and more bruises on her hips, scratches on her arms, and handcuff bruises on her wrists and ankles. Victor was shocked. Whoever did that to her must have been really fucking mad and also really good. As far as he could remember, Nicole had always had the upper hand in fights. She was too fast and she hit too hard to ever let anyone overpower her. But someone had beaten her black and blue, and sure as fucking hell he was gonna torture them to death. \"Nicole?\" he asked as he shook her gently, careful not to touch any of her bruises. \"Nicole,\" he repeated louder. The woman woke up abruptly and immediately sat up and looked for her gun. \"Nicky, it's me,\" he reassured her, gently caressing the side of her face. Nicole shied away from his touch and looked at him. The man was shocked by the look on her face, a mix of fear and guilt, with a side of misery. He'd never seen her like that. \"What the fuck happened?\" \"I live dangerously,\" Nicole shrugged, looking away. Her features relaxed into her usual I-couldn't-give-a-flying-shit expression, and Victor sighed deeply. \"That looks like a bullet,\" he noticed, gesturing at her shoulder. \"I'll be right back.\" Nicole tilted her head slightly, raising a brow as she observed the wound. Yes, that was definitely a bullet. She hadn't noticed it before, she was too sore to notice anything. Victor came back in a couple of minutes, holding a fifth of whiskey, a sewing needle and a knife. \"It's just a scratch, Vic,\" she shrugged again. \"Shut up,\" the man answered, then proceeded to pour the whiskey on the open wound. Nicole cringed, but no sound came out of her mouth, not even when Victor dug the knife into her flesh to take the bullet out. Blood poured down her arm and stained the sheets, then finally he sow her up and threw some more whiskey on the wound. Nicole was as still as a corpse, her eyes fixed on the wound, looking angry, and a little bit disgusted. \"There, all good,\" Victor commented, with a half smile. Nicole didn't thank him. She didn't even look at him, she just lay back down on the bed and rolled over, giving her back to him. Victor let out another deep sigh and crawled on the bed next to her. She stiffened as soon as he tried to hold her, but he wasn't gonna let her have her way that night. He held her so tight that she had trouble breathing, but she discovered that she kinda liked it. The man stroked her hair, and she buried her face in his chest, trying her best to hold back the tears. She failed.[Chapter 3] 3. Doubts Nicole got up early and took the longest shower ever. She tried to ignore the burning pain that ran through her whole body, just like she ignored the memories of the day before which were still vivid in her mind. The heat of the water made her numb after a while. \"Nicole?\" Victor called from the bedroom. She wanted to answer, but no sound came out of her mouth. He was gonna hear the water running and realize she was in the shower, or at least that's what she hoped. The stitches he'd given her the night before were holding better than she expected, but they pinched a little. As soon as the scorching water numbed that too, she got out of the shower and put a towel around her waist, then she went back to the bedroom and collapsed on the bed. \"Good morning to you too,\" Vic said sarcastically. The woman didn't even look at him. \"So... you wanna tell me what happened?\" \"No.\" \"Nicole, don't shut me out. Not this time.\" \"Okay, fine,\" the woman sighed, frustrated. \"I was working a job. I got distracted, and my target had some pretty scary bodyguards. Happy now?\" she spat out. Victor looked at her, concerned. Nicole was a lot of things, but she was never a liar. So why was she lying to him now? Maybe she was ashamed, because no one had ever succeeded in beating her up that badly? What was she hiding from him? An affair maybe? No. She'd never do that. Then what could it be? \"I'm sorry, babe,\" Vic said, stroking her hair. He wasn't gonna mention his doubts, that would just make her more defensive. \"Vic, you know I love you right?\" \"Well that came outta nowhere,\" the man said, pinching the bridge of his nose. \"Yeah, of course I do.\" \"Good.\" \"What's with the cheesiness lately, Nicky?\" \"I'm not cheesy. Don't call me cheesy.\" \"Touchy-feely?\" \"Neither,\" the woman exploded, and stormed out of the room. When Victor finally found the strength to follow her, he found her in the living room, fully dressed and ready to leave the house. \"Where are you going?\" \"I have a job to finish,\" she simply stated, and left slamming the door behind her. Having to lie to Victor was the worst feeling in the world, she felt like throwing up and slamming her head against a wall. But survival came first, she had to think for herself. The thought didn't reassure her, and when she got to the motel on the interstate where she had the appointment, she had to stop the car abruptly to throw up in the parking lot. What am I doing?, she kept asking herself as she walked in. The room smelled like urine and menthol, and suddenly she needed to puke again. But the man in the suit was already there. \"Miss Bolton,\" the man greeted her. \"You're late.\" \"Cut the crap, Freddy.\" \"Your eye's looking better.\" \"Anyone ever tell you that you hit like a girl?\" \"I don't usually like getting my hands dirty,\" the man replied, and handed her a piece of paper. Nicole looked down at it as she took it from his hands, and chuckled darkly. \"That's my final offer, sweetheart.\" \"Make that 3 millions, and you have a deal.\" \"2 and a half.\" \"3.\" \"Fine. 3 millions it is. It's a pleasure doing business with you.\" \"Wish I could say the same.\" The man took his suitcase and left the room. Nicole's smirk vanished in an instant, and soon enough she was bent over the toilet bowl, reversing the full content of her stomach. That was it, she'd done it, and there was no going back.[Chapter 4] 4. Misery Victor observed his lover as she rode on top of him, violent and desperate like only killers could be, and he wondered what was going through Nicole's mind. She wasn't there, she moaned and shivered in his lap, but she wasn't there. Nicole twisted her hips, moving in circles around his length, and he wasn't thinking anymore. He leapt up and held her tight, wasting himself inside of her. Nicole grinned in satisfaction and kissed his forehead before crawling down on the bed. It took a few seconds for Victor to think straight, but when he did the first thought that came to his mind wasn't comforting. \"Nicole,\" he breathed. \"Hm?\" she mumbled, lighting a cigarette. \"You didn't—\" \"No.\" Nicole smiled at him, but there was something weird about that smile. Victor could see death and destruction behind it. The woman looked away from him and got up, mumbling something about a shower. When he heard the water running, he followed her and stood outside the bathroom door, not sure what he was doing, or why he was doing it. But there was something very wrong in the way she looked at him, and suspicion clouded his mind. He heard sobbing. Then, Nicole broke down in tears. He could see in his mind the way the hysterical sobs were shaking her body, but he didn't move an inch. Nicole knew he was outside the door; there was no way in hell he could ever sneak up on her. She could see the shadow of his feet under the door, could almost hear him breathing. She wished he would come get her. She wished he would hold her tight until the tears stopped and then put a bullet in her head. But he didn't. He leaned on the door and pinched the bridge of his nose, hoping she'd stop crying. He couldn't stand to listen. Maybe if she told him what was happening, he could help her. Maybe if she were sincere with him, he wouldn't be standing there doing nothing. If she only talked to him, he wouldn't feel so angry. He was frustrated. He would have wanted to punch her until she told him the truth. The water stopped. Victor got back to the bedroom, careful not to make any noise, though he knew she was probably aware of his presence all along. Nicole looked in the mirror. Her make-up had melted and stained her cheeks black; she looked like a puppy lost under the pouring rain. She had to convince herself to get out of the bathroom, after Victor had heard her cry she wasn't sure she could ever look at him again. She was crying too much lately, and that disgusted her. Besides, what would Victor think? He was many things, but he was never stupid. He must have known something was up. She put on a straight face and finally got back to the bedroom. Victor lay on the bed, trying to look nonchalant. \"You should get dressed, Eddie will be here soon,\" Nicole said, her gaze lingering on Victor's body. \"You don't look like you want me to get dressed,\" the man smirked. \"Get dressed,\" Nicole dryly replied, turning away. Victor snorted, but obeyed. Soon after, Eddie arrived and Victor left with him. The poker game had been planned for a week, and Nicole had planned everything else around it. She took all the guns in the house, except for hers, and locked them in the safe. She was folding Vic's leather jacket when she noticed something in the pocket. Hesitantly, she pulled a little velvety box out of the pocket. And her heart sank. Unable to open it, she tossed the box on the other end of the room and collapsed on the couch. Why was he doing this to her now? He ' s not doing anything. I am. . Hello people! The next chapter is going to be the last one, probably. Let me know what you think so far, I'd really appreciate it! xoxo[Chapter 5] 5. Forgiveness \"Can we talk?\" Nicole asked weakly, sitting beside Victor. \"Of course, babe,\" he smiled. \"Something's gonna happen tonight. I just need you to know that I'm sorry, but I don't regret what I did. You know me, I always think of myself first. I love you, but that's not enough,\" she spat out, trying so hard not to cry. \"What the fuck are you talking about?\" Vic exploded. Finally, she was being honest with him, but what she was saying didn't make any sense at all. Nicole lowered her stare, and suddenly she remembered the little velvety box she'd thrown on the floor. She gave it one quick gaze, and hoped Vic didn't notice it. But he did. \"Is that-\" he started, but the look in her eyes made him stop mid-sentence. \"Nicole, are you leaving me?\" \"I would never leave you,\" she whispered. \"But we're going to be apart, yes.\" \"I don't understand,\" he said, frustrated. Nicole suddenly buried her face in his chest, but she didn't cry. She just held him close and listened to his heartbeat, trying to imprint it in her memory for when she needed to remember it. \"Nicole, you're scaring me,\" Victor said, and the woman just held him tighter. \"I love you,\" she whispered. \"I will always love you.\" Victor didn't say a word. He had no idea what was going on, no idea what to say to make her feel better. Although, wasn't he the one who needed to feel better? All clues led to believe that he was being dumped... but that wasn't it, was it? Maybe, she got scared because of the ring she'd found, and now she wanted to put a bullet in his head. That was the way Nicole's brain worked. \"Babe?\" he asked. The woman looked up at him. \"Please, tell me what's going on.\" \"My love,\" she whispered once again. \"I had no choice.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"They beat it out of me,\" she said. \"They said I would never see the sunlight again. They gave me so much money...\" \"Who did?\" Victor asked. He was beginning to understand what was happening. \"Oh, Vic,\" she sighed. \"I love you...\" \"Stop saying that!\" he yelled, and pushed her away from him. He stood up and paced around the room, incredulous. \"You sold me out,\" he stated. \"Vic, I—\" \"You did, didn't you?\" There was no answer. Nicole saw a shadow under the door, and pinched the bridge of her nose. Freddy was here, there was no going back now. In a split second the door slammed open, and detective Freddy Jenkins stood there, gun in hand, surrounded by six other feds. \"How could you do this to me?\" Vic yelled. Nicole sank into the sofa and finally a tear rolled down her cheek. Freddy's men cuffed Victor and took him away. The detective stayed behind and sat down next to Nicole. \"Survival of the fittest, Nicole,\" he said. \"You did the right thing.\" \"Get out,\" she hissed. \"I thought we might go get a drink,\" the man smirked. Nicole grabbed him by the collar and threw him down on the floor. \"I said get out!\" she yelled. Freddy stood up and straightened his suit, then walked right out the door without uttering another word. Nicole closed the door behind him, then she went back to the couch and curled up on it, and she cried her fucking heart out. When she was done crying, she took a shower, trying to wash away the guilt and regret she was feeling. She wasn't used to feeling that way, and it made her physically sick. But she had work to do that night. She got out of the shower and got dressed, then headed for the door. She took Victor's Cadillac and drove away into the night.

He only watches his performances in secret, under the guise of being 'out', working. And yet, after everything he's done, been through, seen, he couldn't help but feel life after Harry was a shock. He was an idiot, sure, but everything else seemed to change, all at once. Perry got a flood of new clients after Harry slowly but surely charmed the wealthy socialites who wanted their husbands caught on camera with the maid. [Or pool boy, in one case]. He had a way of getting along with people, making him an incredible secretary. An asset. Perry's been told he's a little abrasive sometimes. He can't help it. Neither of them discuss the amount of business Harry's able to pull in, the way he gets Perry twice as much work as he's ever had. He doesn't lord it over him; really he seems uncomfortable with any mention of competence on his part at all. It's like he prefers everyone think he's nice but stupid. It's his knee jerk reaction, and Perry will have his own reaction if he ever finds out who taught him to feel that way. Of course, to balance Harry's positives out, he still does things like accidentally put a camera in the fridge once and fall asleep on the couch, head resting on Perry's rolled up old sweater. It makes him feel things, seeing him look so young in his sleep, face pillowed on Perry's clothes. It was strange, feeling something real for someone. In his town, things like that rarely happened. Harry seemed to be impervious to the corruption and cruelty of L.A.. He had even started acting in recurring television roles. [Perry had obviously forced him to use a fake name that he most emphatically did not let him choose.] And it wasn't just Perry who felt oddly sincere about his little friend. It was Harry, too. He could tell, even if only from the way he would sit beside him on the couch. Harry was soft, in every way-he seemed to melt into his side, next to him; the way he talks and talks, but clams up if another man tries to engage with him too friendly-ish. Perry kind of likes being the one guy in Harry's life, or person in his life. It's not like he's got any women. The reality is, Harry starts making more money with constant roles than the actual P.I. office does. [It's an unspoken reality.] He still comes with him sometimes, and does all the paperwork and phone calls, but mostly he's just out acting, on set. At home, Perry gave him his own room, but it still looks terrible. It has barely anything of Harry's. He just didn't have much. It upsets Perry somehow, but he can just manage to restrain himself from asking where his stuff is. Where did it go? Everyone has random stuff, pointless things. Childhood mementos, clutter. But Harry has almost nothing. His room stands empty for days and days; it doesn't seem to bother Harry, but then, not much does. Sure he whines a little, and rambles a lot, but he doesn't really talk about his thoughts. His opinions. [Like why is he living with Perry? They never talk about it. Harry never really mentions his orientation, and when rude little bastards call him his bitch, he just laughs. He technically pays Harry, but he had to set his bank account up himself-and Perry knows he doesn't use the money. He only uses his acting cash, and is apparently paid half in it as well. The other half goes into the bank. He checks his accounts just to protect him, god knows the producers could screw him or something. Somebody's got to look out for him. And he gets job after job, until he really has enough to go live on his own quite comfortably. Not that Perry informs him of it. He can see the signs of change in himself-the attachment, the comfort. And it's there vice versa: Harry looks to him for safety, and for approval. Perry's just worried that he's alone in looking to his little friend for love, too. He's already got the other two. Harry always speaks of him like he's some heroic character-yes, Perry listens in on a lot of his conversations. Harry's got a loud voice, okay? It's not like it's intentional. And while he might not be able to fight his way out of a cardboard box, Perry does feel safe with him. Safe, as in he'd never hurt him, he cares about him. If he hears Perry having a nightmare, he's come in before, and sat on the bed next to him, and talked and put an arm around him. He never mentions it the next day, or ever, really. All without any uncomfortable talk.] Sometimes, Harry's the best. So Perry ends up realizing he's unconsciously kept buying him things just to fill up that discomfiting empty space. It's a troubling thought. He's tried to keep from thinking about how attached he is to Harry, how much he enjoys having someone around. Harry is such a sweet, funny person by nature-Perry thought people like him didn't exist. But Harry is real, going over his lines in his room, endlessly walking back and forth, talking to himself. And he has this type of innocence, this weird sincerity, that draws him in. He wants to have him, and protect him from the world, all at once. You can't really hear to much out in the hall, but Perry has listened to him go over his lines. It's mostly disjointed words. He'd expected Harry to brag about his paychecks from set, but instead he never mentions them at all. They just keep getting direct deposited to Perry's account. [He set him up as a subsidiary family member, so it's technically his account as well. Of course, he never seems to think things like dates or times are important, so it's lucky he's got Perry.] The whole thing means Harry found his checkbook, made a void check and gave it to the accounting people. He'd kind of just assumed that he'd take all the money in cash, but no. He's very off the grid, cash only, random disposable cell phone-very ready to be a flew the coop story. Harry never mentions money either, despite being his dependent [and putting it in that joint account]. To be fair, Perry doesn't talk either. It's too creepy, to mention he's almost had him move in as a type of boyfriend. Perry cooks them breakfast, they constantly hang out together-it's like nobody's naming what's obvious. He's worried that Harry won't react well to being the focus of positive emotion, he just eschews it. Even with that Harmony woman, it was all 'no, no, you're right', and 'I wish I could have someone like you someday'. Like he couldn't imagine someone loving him. Perry's got news for him, but he's just too avoidant. Harry might talk a lot, but he also skates by anything emotional, meaningful or serious. And he can't approach the subject at all. It's too serious, too real. It's so much easier to keep things as the status quo day after day.[Chapter 2] Harry had always lived his life light. From his home as a kid, to attending college classes on the cheap [if you sit in the back no one notices], to going from one form of thievery to another, he was always moving. Always free. Before meeting Perry, his current forays into quote 'work' were lowbrow. It followed a period where had worked with someone way too into jewels. She had been a real professional, and so had he. But she had hesitated before helping him out of a momentary snag, wanting to get the jewels instead of saving him. It had made him sad, somehow. Even though she hadn't left him for dead, she'd paused. Thought about it. Leaving him had been her instinct. It was knowledge he hadn't wanted to have. He had deliberately chosen only lowbrow partners after that, little crimes that didn't matter. He was tired of the big game, of big stakes. He'd studied with a lock breaker, a charmer, a pickpocket, a safecracker and of course, the jewel thief. All of them had been unique, interesting. They'd taught him irreplaceable skills, and how to work with others. It was a hard thing to do, after always being alone and relying only on yourself. He'd had a little hope that Harmony might work out, but unsurprisingly, she'd wanted better. Especially since he never told anyone what he was really worth. The real professionals never seemed to come off as wealthy. It was bad form to wear or drive anything expensive. People barely liked him as it was, if they'd known what his Cayman Island bank account said they'd just lie and pretend to value him. Most thieves only dated within their own specialization, but Harry preferred to move on and within different types of work. Anyway, he was basically with Perry already, right? While his real life of being a thief was usually fine, his 'normal', mundane life was the problem. He just couldn't manage it, the bills and mail, the endless normal things you had to keep up on. You had to buy groceries and pay an electric bill. Get gas, do the laundry. It was too much, and too complicated, with all its little details. He'd had mighty little experience with domestic, normal life and didn't it seem like it was too late to learn now? He'd just gone through life latching onto one expert thief after another, and stayed with them as an apprentice of sorts. They'd had maids to handle the house, and assistants to handle the everyday stuff. As a result, Harry had just recently realized he was not prepared for regular anything. Meeting Perry had only emphasized that. And yet... Perry made him kinda want to stay playacting this normal life. Having a 'straight' job as an actor. Coming home to one place at night for a reason. For a loved one. Perry was so stable, so rooted down in his big house with all its stuff. How do you even manage to get all that stuff? Harry felt sure that Perry was a low level hoarder. Probably because of how bad his father had been, he mused. He kind of always felt sorry for Perry, in some vague, general way, because he seemed so sad inside, so stoic but lonely. He tried to cheer him up a little, but Perry was impervious to being cheery. Harry had always thought the only goal of life was to enjoy yourself and be [a little] good, but Perry seemed to think work was all there was. His only fun purchases seemed to be ice cream, weird fancy kinds Harry had never bothered trying before. He'd always just had chocotacos or cornettos. Perry seemed to take everything seriously, even meals. Instead of just eating cheerios and then going out to get burritos, he actually made food by hand. In a kitchen. Harry would sometimes sit and watch him, almost interested in how it all worked. He'd never tried to cook himself, and couldn't remember his parents ever doing it either. Perry is different. He eats imported Icelandic yogurt. [It tastes pretty plain to Harry]. He has classical music on in the house sometimes, and pours them out wine when they have dinner. All of it kind of shocks Harry-he didn't know this was what normal people life was like-but he doesn't say anything. Besides, Perry likes to teach him things, he will talk endlessly about what Harry's supposed to taste in a particular red. Harry dutifully doesn't tell him he doesn't really like wine very much. It must be a gay thing. There's a lot he doesn't know about being gay, but since Perry is the only guy he's ever liked, he figures it's just an aberration in his own self. Perry basically acts like they're together, and Harry has decided he's fine with that. Eventually they'll do all the bedroom stuff, whatever that actually would be in real life, but he's sure Perry will know how to handle him. He already does, anyway. Harry spends most of time doing acting jobs, which are pretty boring, except for the acting part. That's okay. It's fun to pretend to be someone else. And you get paid for it! It's amazing. Perry doesn't seem to have a high opinion of tv or movies, he doesn't really mention it. He keeps Harry doing his secretary stuff. It's kind of nice to live with someone. He's always lived with other people, but it was professional, for work. They were studying blueprints and techniques constantly. You didn't get weekends off, you didn't hang out very much. Everyone was obsessed with the score. Even though they were all so rich, that's all they cared about. After the first few jewelry heists, and exploring what people actually keep in their safes [very weird stuff sometimes!], it got a little old hat. Jewelry's just stones in the end, no matter how much it's worth. It's much more invigorating to have someone to talk to, to have a friend. Harry's had acquaintances, mentors, apprentices himself, co-workers, assistants and associates. Never friends. It feels nice to talk to someone because he wants to, without a goal. Perry's really very nice. He doesn't like to be called on it, but he is a little over-invested in Harry. He always wants to know if whoever he's talking to is trustworthy; if someone calls he wants to know if they treated him right. Sometimes Harmony calls while drunk and definitely does not treat him right. Perry always gets furious with her and makes her apologize - after taking the phone away from him. Harry can't bring himself to tell him it's okay. It's happened a lot over the years. And he himself calls her too. He doesn't even need to be drunk to be embarrassing. He can cry about his parents just fine while sober. Being with Perry is the best thing in his life. He's so strong, in the emotional sense, like stability-and also strong for real. He's always worried about him, protective, he chides him to go to the doctor [his private one] because his health is important, he wants to hang out with him every day. When Harry comes home from an acting gig, he looks up as he comes in like he's pleased. Like he wants to talk to him, missed him. Nobody's ever missed him before. It's a good feeling, Harry thinks. Perry even buys him things. Half the stuff seems to be some gay thing Harry doesn't understand, if he's honest. I mean, what's the purpose of a chair with a weird name? Perry lectures him about Eames furniture, Diptique candles, cologne, clothes. He buys him clothes and stuff from places Harry's never heard of but mentally refers to as 'alphabet soup': APC, Clive no. 1, Thom Browne, YSL, Buly. He always seems anxious that Harry like it. And he does, because it's nice of him. It's sweet, if ultimately misguided. Harry doesn't care about stuff. He had a lot of stuff, it didn't mean anything. Only people matter.[Chapter 3] The story continues here: /works/6732886/ ","Summary":" Perry's had a lot of life experiences-many more than his erstwhile assistant, he's sure, but it doe"},{"Movie":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang","Title":"Confessions (or what happens when your ex-dream girl and your gay room","Author":"KeeperofSeeds","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11846897","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It all started when Perry and I were at Harmony's house for a movie night. She and Perry could bond over chick flicks but every once in a while Harmony and I could gang up and convince Perry to watch an action flick. Perry always said he had enough action in his work life and he didn't need while he was off the clock thank you very much. Tonight's movie had a secondary character that Harmony thought looked like our old buddy Chook. Remember that guy that she promised she wouldn't sleep with but then totally did? Yeah, him. Remember how pissed I was about that? Well….there was more to the story than I made it out to be. So yeah, she mentioned that the guy in the movie looked like Chook and that got me thinking. After that whole Christmas incident was over I spent a lot of time filing paperwork for Perry and that gave me a lot of time to reflect. And well I started feeling kinda guilty about not telling Harmony the whole story. But she had recently chopped my finger off and so I think I was entitled to some hard feeling then, alright? Don't judge me. I guess my internal monologue took longer than I thought because by the time I look back up both Harmony and Perry are looking at me strangely, having been waiting for my response while I tried to pull together all my thoughts . \"Nah, I don't think he looks that much like Chook,\" I finally managed to say. Perry just rolled his eyes at me and turned back to the movie but Harmony's eyes lingered. Like she was trying to get inside my head. This just made me more uncomfortable and I don't know why but just as she turned back towards the TV I blurted out, \"you weren't the only one.\" Not the greatest way to begin my confession, I know but fuck I was nervous as hell and if this wasn't the quintessential awkward moment I don't what is. Her head snapped back towards me. \"what the hell are you going on about Harry?\" Perry had paused the movie and was looking at me curiously as well. Having both their focus just made me more ramble-y and more likely to start stuttering. You think they would learn by now I suck at spilling the beans when under pressure. Apparently not as they just kept staring expectantly. \"I, uh….um. Well,\" rubbing the back of my neck with one hand, trying and failing to think of some way to put this that wouldn't end with me getting slapped by Harmony and laughed at by Perry. \"Just spit it out doofus,\" Perry says, obviously tired of my stalling. \"I kindamaybesleptwithChook\" I spit out eyes everywhere but on the two of them. Instead of laughter or violence, stunned silence meant my announcement.[Chapter 2] Perry blinked confusedly at him and then dug one manicured finger in his ear. \"Wait a minute… Say that again because I must have had something in my ear or temporarily been transferred to an alternative reality.\" Harry spared him a quick glare and then snuck a glance at Harmony whose mouth was comically hanging open. \"I said… I kind of slept with Chook.\" The situation might have been humorous if it had been happening to someone else but Harry was still waiting for Harmony to process his words and the beat down that would surely come after. Maybe Perry would defend him… On second thought, no. Perry would probably let her kick his ass and then criticize Harry's pathetic attempt to fight back. Bastard. Harmony finally closed her mouth and Harry's words had finally sunk in because her face was turning red. She shot up from her seat and stomped over to where Harry was cowering in Perry's leather seat. \"You little shit! This was why you didn't want me to sleep with Chook?! Because you were sleeping with him?! \"NO! No no no no!\" Harry protested. Harmony merely raised an eyebrow. \"Well, yes I did, but only once! It, um, didn't work out…\" Harry pathetically trailed off. \"You fucking kicked me of your hotel room in my underwear when I told you!\" Harmony yelled. She spared a look for Perry who was still strangely quiet and whatever she saw in his face made her pause in her raging and look back at Harry, who was doing his best chastised expression complete with puppy eyes, and then the anger seemed to drain out of her. \"Goddamn it Harry,\" she sighed. \"I just…need some time to think on this. I'll call you later this week. She grabbed her coat and quickly left, not even pausing to say good bye to Perry. After the door closed Perry finally let out the laugh he had been holding in during Harmony's tirade. \"I knew with a name like that the guy had to be gay\" he said. \"But congratulations Chief, you surprised me again. Not many people do that.\" \"Aren't you going to make fun of me now, Perry?\" Harry dejectedly inquired. \"Maybe I can be Gay Harry now and we can be the fabulous gay detective duo or something like that.\" \"I may be a mean bastard but I don't make fun of other guy's relationship problems.\" Perry was however intrigued by Harry's confession and so leaned forward on the couch sympathetically and inquired in his best 'stereotypical gay best friend' voice, \"So, what went wrong with you and the bff?\" Harry raised a skeptical eyebrow at Perry but decided that he had nothing to lose really by sharing more of his fucked up story and so began, \"well... it was pretty simple really. One night we got together at his house and decided it would be a good idea to steal a bottle of his father's whiskey and proceed to get drunk off our asses. Sometime during that he tells me that he thinks he might be gay and kisses me. Things went kinda quickly after that and gradually get more blurry as the night went on. You'll remember that at this point in my sad life I was pining away for Harmony and hadn't gotten any in a while so when Chook starting undoing my jeans I decided 'hey, a blow jobs a blow job, and decided to roll with whatever he did. Things obvious went a little further than that but the next clear thing I remember is waking up the next morning sore and naked in Chook's bedroom to the sound of him barfing in the bathroom. Needless to say my first gay morning after was terribly awkward and we quickly decided to go back to being just friends. Though now that I think about it maybe we didn't work out so much as he decided he wasn't that gay and that he wanted to try sleeping with Harmony as well.[Chapter 3] \"So your first and only gay experience scarred you for life,\" Perry mused aloud, thinking of Harry's reaction to his surprise distraction kiss last Christmas in a whole new context. \"Probably, yeah.\" Harry conceded. \"Well, that's a shame, Harry, considering the way that man at the club was looking at you last week.\" Perry smirked. That comment brought Harry out of his gloomy thoughts. \"You are never going to let that go are you!\" he said exasperatedly. \"The guy offered to buy me one drink is all! Not like he waltzed up and invited me to a gang bang.\" Perry was still smirking, damn him. \"Not like I'm getting any other offers though, which is pretty sad now that I think about it. Only offer I've had in the past 6 months is a dude who looked like a young Mexican Shatner. Maybe I should've taken him up on that drink. I don't think Harmony is gonna be talking to be for a loooong time.\" Perry's smirk had disappeared now and he was looking over at Harry questioningly. \"You'd let take that guy take you home? Trust me Chief when I tell you that your kissing needs some work before anyone, gay or straight takes you to their place.\" \"Hey now!\" Harry protested, \"you just fucking grabbed me and start sucking face, and expect me to be concentrating on technique?! And besides, there was a lot going on that night with Harmony not being dead and maybe, oh yeah, a dead freakin body in my shower!\" \"So you're saying you could do better?\" Perry slyly asked. \" Yeah. Yeah I am.\" Harry decided, glaring at Perry as if daring him to say otherwise. \"How about we put that theory of yours to the test?\" Perry asked, suddenly moving from the expensive leather couch to the side of Harry's chair. Harry gaped stupidly at Perry chest for a minute before letting his eyes travel up to meet the P.I.'s. Harry's tongue darted out to wet his lips before slowly standing up as well. \"Well, um….okay. Only to prove I'm right.\" Perry said nothing, opting instead to grip the back of the smaller man's head and draw him into a kiss before he could change his mind. It started out slow, both men exploring the shape of the other's mouth, until Harry managed to slip in some tongue. The slow slick-slide made Harry's insides shiver. Other parts of his body were becoming interested as well, but he ignored them for the moment. Okay. Perry had to admit, the man wasn't as bad as he had feared. But really, his plan had gone thru and that was that, he thought. He'd convinced Harry to kiss him once and (hopefully) gotten that urge out of his system. Now they could go back to just being partners. Harry broke the kiss and Perry pulled back a little slower than he normally would. Harry's eyes were darker than normal and his lips red from the kiss. Still, he managed to sound mostly nonchalant, \"So, did I pass your test, boss man?\" \"Yeah,\" Perry replied in a low voice, looking away and mentally killing and stuffing his fantasies of office sex into a deep dark box in the back of his mind. He looked up at Harry and managed to dig up a small grin. It was as fake as the plants in their apartment and hoped Harry was his usual unobservant self and didn't notice. Unfortunately, it was easier to read someone's facial expressions when you are standing a foot in front of them after just kissing them. Harry thought he had gotten to know Perry pretty well since moving in with him and Perry was definitely acting off. Well, stranger than usual if usual was frenching you partner in the living room after said partner had fessed up about his first and only gay experience. And this kiss with Perry was better than the one by the dumpsters and well…maybe Harry still wasn't quite as straight as he thought. He didn't count Chook. One night he could barely remember didn't make him like Harmony any less. But this kiss with Perry on the other hand… Before he could change his mind Harry grabbed Perry by the shoulders and smashed their lips together again. This kiss was shorter than the first when instead of pushing Harry against the wall to continue the fantasy taking shape in Harry's head Perry's hands were on his pushing them apart. He wasn't saying anything, just staring at Harry inquisitively, breathe still a bit heavy. Harry decided to offer some explanation before Perry started imposing time limits for him to explain again. \"Well, Per…I….\" Damn this was harder than he thought. How were you suppose to tell your boss/partner that you maybe weren't as straight as he thought and that you liked kissing him and were totally maybe interested in more? \"Well?\" Perry asking, looking more impatient and less hot and bothered. Harry decided to just spit it out. \"I kinda enjoyed that kiss more that I thought I would,\" he admitted, \"and I was thinking you did too and maybe we could keep doing that..and maybe eventually more?\" That got Perry's attention and the smirk re appeared. Really, Harry thought, he could give the Cheshire Cat a run for its money. \"So,\" Perry said as he moved in closer, \"you wouldn't be opposed to me doing something like this?\" And with that he slipped his thigh between Harry's and Harry let out a hissed curse while mentally cursing his betraying body for the boner he was currently wielding. If he was completely honest with himself he'd been trying to ignore his dirtier thoughts towards his partner for a while, but listening to Perry fuck other guys thru the wall and jerking off had quickly became a regular thing for him. Fuck it, Chook didn't work out but he was pretty sure Perry wouldn't get him drunk, fuck him, and then kick him out.

They all wondered what to do until they heard other dogs barking and a mother fox was running with her baby in her mouth. \"What's going on?\" Collette asked. \"That mother is being chased.\" Annette frowned. \"Ooh, I love a good chase!\" Danielle beamed. \"Danielle, this looks serious.\" Patch told her. \"Oh... Well, I still love a good chase.\" Danielle shrugged innocently. \"We better go help her.\" Patch said. Angel poked her head through the doggy door. \"Mo, we're going out for a bit.\" she then told her mistress. \"Okay, be careful.\" Mo said as she read a book with Atticus. Angel nodded and soon left with the others to go probably follow mother fox. Danielle seemed to get lost on the way however and went to a different area as the mother fox looked around until she left her baby and looked sad for him. The mother fox heard the dog barking getting louder and soon ran as far away as she could, but the next sound heard after she disappeared was the sound of a shotgun. Hearing that caused Patch and the others to stop. Another shotgun was heard which made Patch and the others cringe. Colette shivered and looked scared and sad from the noise. Patch looked to her and decided to comfort her. \"Does that mean she's...?\" Angel frowned. \"Yeah...\" Scamp gulped. An owl flew down from a tree and saw the fox kit left behind hiding in the blades of grass. Once the fox kit saw the owl, he hid behind one of the fence poles. \"Wow, I've never seen a fox up close before.\" Patch said as he comforted Colette who was upset and worried about the gunshot. Colette seemed to blush under her fur about how kind and brave Patch was. \"You poor little fella...\" The owl cooed to the poor fox kit who was now an orphan. \"It's all right... Big Mama's here.\" The owl and fox kit didn't seem to see or hear Patch and the others. The fox kit kept trying to avoid the owl since it thought she was a predator. There was soon barking heard in the distance of where the fox's mother had been shot. \"Ya know, you're gonna need some caring for,\" The owl smiled to the fox kit. \"Now, let's see, darling... You need, um...\" The fox kit soon nuzzled against her, now able to trust her. Big Mama already knew what he was thinking. Colette soon settled down due to how cute the fox kit was. \"Oh, no, no, not me, not Big Mama now.\" The female owl chuckled before thinking about where to send the fox to, but she was distracted by an obnoxious pecking sound. \"Augh!\" Annette groaned. \"I have a headache now!\" Big Mama hid the fox kit into the grass and soon flew off to where the pecking noise was coming from. \"Where is that sound coming from?!\" Collette groaned. \"Hm...\" Patch hummed in thought. \"I would guess a tree... I bet you it's a woodpecker.\" \"Must be.\" Collette said. \"Has anyone seen Danielle?\" Scamp asked. Everyone looked around and just now noticed that the tomboy cocker spaniel puppy was gone. \"Oh, no!\" Annette and Collette panicked for their sister. \"We better find her.\" Angel said. Patch looked worried about the fox kit being alone while they went off to find her. Eventually, Big Mama came back with two birds, and one was in fact a woodpecker who knocked on the door of the house that wasn't too far away from where they were, and there came out an old woman who seemed to live alone and soon found the fox kit. Patch knew that the fox kit was in good hands now. Danielle ended up in someone else's yard. There was an older man who drove to what seemed to be his house and brought out a bag to an older dog who slept outside and showed a hound dog puppy who was named Copper. \"Copper?!\" Danielle yelped at how young the pup she was in love with was. \"Wait, wait, so, you and the others were somehow seeing the past?\" Scruffy's voice asked. \"It's hard to explain, but yeah...\" Patch replied as he scratched behind his ear briefly. \"I guess someone just wanted us to see how Tod and Copper came to be before we all became friends.\" \"So, you did meet them at Puppy School.\" Dot smiled. Patch nodded. \"Great story, Dad...\" Scruffy muttered. \"The best five minutes of my life.\" \"Keep going.\" Dot said politely to her parents. \"Hey!\" Scruffy pouted. \"Well, you know, eventually we met Tod and Copper and we all became friends,\" Patch smiled to Scruffy and Dot before frowning with a slight sigh. \"Even though Copper's human didn't like that.\" \"Well, he was a hunter.\" Collette clarified. \"Yeah... Kind of a nasty one...\" Patch narrowed his eyes as he didn't like Copper's master very much. \"But, luckily, we could play with Tod and Copper when not in Puppy School.\" Back in the old days, it was the weekend, which meant there was no school today, since Tod didn't have a human kid to play with, he went to go see if he could play with his best friend. Patch was seen going to join the others since they were all friends. \"Hey, guys, you wanna come see Copper with me?\" Tod smiled to the other puppies. \"Y-Yeah, sounds like fun.\" Danielle smiled back. \"You know it.\" Patch added. Tod smiled as he took them over there. A rooster crow was heard when they came to the residence. \"Copper!\" Tod called out as he waited with the others while the older dog known as Chief was sleeping. \"Copper, you ready to play?\" Scamp smiled. Copper was happy to see them all and tried to come over, but was a little nervous since Chief was fast asleep in the middle of the ground. \"Come on, Copper!\" Danielle smiled. Copper eventually made it over Chief, and smiled back as he ran towards Tod and the other puppies. Tod and Copper playfully tackled each other before they went to go play on the beautiful weekend day. Nothing seemed to ruin their fun besides Copper's master. \"Copper, you're my very best friend.\" Tod smiled. \"You're mine too, Tod!\" Copper smiled back. \"We'll all be friends forever.\" Scamp smiled. \"That's right.\" Patch smiled back. \"Hey, let's go swimming!\" Tod suggested. \"If I get a head-start, I can beat ya!\" Copper laughed as he ran ahead. \"Hey!\" Danielle laughed. They went to the nearby pond and then went to take a swim all together, and where they all had fun swimming. Big Mama smiled as she watched them from a high branch. \"Splash! Splash!\" Danielle laughed. \"Got you!\" Colette laughed back. \" STOP SPLASHING ME! \" Annette cried out like a diva. Scamp soon splashed his sisters with a playful smirk. \"HEEEY!\" The cocker spaniel triplets yelped. \"Sorry, ladies, I gotta swim,\" Scamp chuckled to his sisters before he was soon splashed by Angel. \"What the? Hey!\" Angel giggled innocently as she waved to him with a front paw. There was then a whistling noise heard and someone was calling Copper's name. \"Copper, sounds like your owner is calling.\" Collette said. Copper tried to ignore it so that he could still have fun, but he soon stopped and came to the human calling for him. \"I gotta go training...\" he told the others in regret. \"Do ya have to?\" Tod asked with a smile. \"We're having too much fun!\" \"I gotta, he sounds awful mad.\" Copper said as he shook himself dry and kept going. \"We understand.\" Danielle said. \"We'll see ya tomorrow, and don't forget!\" Tod called out. \"I won't!\" Copper called back.[Chapter 2] Patch, Angel, Scamp, Annette, Colette, and Danielle soon came home. Cherry sniffed the air and cringed. \"Ugh, wet dog...\" She soon saw why she smelled wet dog. \"We went swimming today.\" Patch smiled to Atticus. \"We can tell by your smell.\" Atticus said. \"Oops, sorry.\" Patch smiled sheepishly. \"Time to dry you guys off.\" Mo said. \"Don't shake-\" Cherry yelped, only to get sprinkled on by the water as the dogs shook themselves dry. \"In the house...\" she then said with a sigh before storming off. \"I'm gonna soak in the tub.\" Mo soon brought out towels and started to dry off the pups. \"I feel funny around Copper sometimes... I don't know how to explain it...\" Danielle said while they were being dried off. \"You must be feeling love.\" Collette said. \"Love?\" Danielle asked. \"What is love anyway?\" \"I've been wondering that too.\" Scruffy's voice said. \"Well, you never know how to describe it unless you experience it yourself, it's a lot of wonderful feelings, but sometimes, I like to see it as sparks flying among one another.\" Patch advised to his son. \"That's nice.\" Scruffy said. \"You'll know about it eventually.\" Patch smiled. Scruffy stuck his tongue out while Dot sighed dreamily about love. \"Anyways, what happened next?\" Scruffy asked. \"Well...\" Colette sighed. \"The next time we saw Copper, it was a little sad... He was gonna come and see us, but he didn't come like he said he would, so we decided to go and see what kept him at home.\" The next day in the childhood memory... Copper had a rope tied around his neck connected to the barrel he slept in like Chief so he couldn't wander off again. Tod and the others soon arrived. \"Hey, Copper, what happened to ya?\" The fox kit asked the hound dog puppy. \"Why didn't you-...Golly! You're all tied up!\" \"Yeah, and it's no fun either,\" Copper frowned. \"My master says I gotta stay home until school.\" \"That isn't fair.\" Patch frowned. \"Why?\" Tod smiled. \"We can play around here then!\" \"Uh, Tod, I don't think Copper's human would want you around here...\" Collette said nervously. \"She's right, Tod,\" Copper told the fox before gesturing to the older dog who was sleeping. \"Especially with Chief over there.\" \"Uh-oh...\" Scamp gulped. \"Is that him making all that awful noise?\" Tod glared about the snoring. \"It keeps me awake at night.\" Copper admitted. Tod soon came over to take a look at Chief. \"Tod, what are you doing?\" Patch whispered. \"Gee, is he ever big...\" Tod commented as he observed Chief. \"His ears aren't as big as yours, Copper.\" \"That's not the part you gotta worry about.\" Copper warned Tod quietly. \"Wow, look at those teeth!\" Tod smiled as he pulled down Chief's lips. \"That's the part?\" Danielle guessed. \"Uh-huh...\" Copper nodded nervously. Chief started to mumble in his sleep and moving a little bit. \"He's waking up!\" Copper yelped before Chief's back leg kicked him. \"Get out, Tod!\" \"No, he's having a dream,\" Tod chuckled out of amusement. \"He's chasing somethin'.\" \"Oh, no...\" Colette gulped. Chief mumbled in his sleep. \"Guys, he's chasing a badger.\" Tod giggled to the others. \"Tod!\" Patch whispered loudly. \"Get out of there!\" \"Yeah, before it's too late.\" Angel whispered. \"No. It ain't a badger. It's a... It's a...\" Chief kept sniffing until he had Tod against the end of the barrel and he woke up once he caught the scent. \"It's a fox... FOX?! \" \"And the chase starts.\" Patch sighed. Copper saw that Danielle was in stunned silence and shock, so he helped her into his barrel to hide while everyone else hid away as Chief chased Tod around. \"Are you okay?\" he then asked the cocker spaniel. \"Uh-huh...\" Danielle blushed that he actually saved her like that. \"Thanks...\" \"No problem.\" Copper told her. Patch was with Colette and Angel was with Scamp. Annette seemed to be alone, but she covered her face with her front paws as Chief chased Tod all around the yard. The chase seemed to catch Copper's and Chief's master's attention. The chickens ran around in a panic from the chase. The hunter man came out, about to shoot, but his pants slid down when he shot the gun. Colette buried her face in Patch's fur since she didn't seem to like the sound of guns. \"Quick, let's get going.\" Scamp said. The others nodded and rushed off to avoid getting shot or worse by the hunter that was Copper's human. The hunter kept trying to shoot at the fox kit, but soon fell over as Chief knocked him down with his barrel filled with chickens. Chief was soon caught in a tree as his barrel rope tied up around the truck, and the chickens flew free. Tod then climbed up and hid inside of the mailbox where his bird friends also where, but of course, the hunter saw him hiding there. The mailbox was nearly destroyed as Tod leaped out with his bird friends out of fear. Chief soon continued to chase Tod down well into the forest. However, with the barrel in the water, it yanked Chief back and he splashed into his barrel as Tod climbed up the meadow to his own home with Widow Tweed, and where he saw that she was leaving in her truck with the milk she milked from the cow. Chief struggled to get up after the young fox kit. Tod soon rushed over to Widow Tweed, but she was driving off without even seeing him, which made him chase her. \"Go, Tod!\" Patch, Collette, Angel, Scamp, Annette, and Danielle smiled. Tod slipped on a puddle, but soon kept running after his human. Copper and Chief's human soon drove after Tod. Danielle then came out with Copper to see what was happening. \"No, Slade, don't!\" Copper barked, though was held back by the rope tied around his neck. Danielle began to gnaw on the rope to try and break it. Copper looked to her. Danielle growled as she chewed on the rope before it seemed to snap broken. Tod ran on the stone wall beside Widow Tweed's car and jumped from a gunshot. \"Tod?!\" Widow Tweed looked over to see her new fox companion until she soon heard the gunshot again. \"I don't like guns.\" Colette sniffled. \"Oh, Colette, it's okay.\" Patch soothed. Widow Tweed soon slammed on her breaks as she had enough of the hunter. There were bullet holes in the milk which leaked over Tod as he hid in the trunk of the old woman's car. The hunter tried to his own brakes, but didn't stop until he was inches from the old woman's face. \"Amos Slade, you trigger-happy lunatic!\" Widow Tweed scolded as she grabbed his gun from him. \"Give me that gun!\" \"Whoa.\" The pups yelped. The gunshot didn't hit the hunter specifically, but hit something else that meant a lot to him. \"My radiator! Why, you blasted female. I'll-\" \"Hold it, right there!\" Widow Tweed, pointing at him with his own gun. \"Watch it, that thing's loaded!\" Amos told her. Widow Tweed glared and shot the air with the gun which scared Tod a little bit. \"Now it ain't loaded!\" The old woman told him with a glare as she threw his gun back to him. Colette hid against Patch from the gunshots. \"Dag nabit, woman!\" Amos glared at Widow Tweed, pointing to Tod as he hid behind the woman's leg. \"You're favorite fox was after my chickens!\" \"Rubbish and poppycock!\" Widow Tweed glared back. \"I don't believe it! He wouldn't hurt a thing!\" Chief soon growled as Amos argued with the lonely old woman. Patch began to growl at Chief. \"You callin' me a liar, you muddle-headed female?!\" Amos furiously glared at Widow Tweed. \"I saw it happen!\" \"Amos Slade, that temper of yours is gonna get you into a lot of trouble someday!\" Widow Tweed warned. \"Temper? Temper! Woman, you ain't seen my temper!\" Amos glared before throwing his hat on the ground and stomped on it. \"If I ever catch that fox on my property again, I'll blast him! And next time, I won't miss!\" Chief growled at Patch now, trying to look scary since he was a bigger and older dog. Patch kept growling, not afraid at all of Chief. Amos soon took Chief with him to go home. Patch nodded firmly and then looked over to Tod as he looked scared. Dot was heard shaking. \"Oh, Dottie, are you okay?\" Colette frowned softly to her daughter. \"That sounded scary.\" Dot said. \"Trust us, that was the least scary part.\" Patch said. \"Oh, yeah, nothing compares to what's coming up.\" Colette agreed. \"I don't wanna hear this anymore!\" Dot cried out. \"Aw, Dot...\" Scruffy frowned to his sister, feeling bad that she was scared. \"Don't worry; the scary part won't come up for a while.\" Patch assured them. \"There's more?\" Dot frowned. \"Well... Can you warn me when it comes?\" \"Of course, dear, we will,\" Colette soothed. \"Maybe this'll cheer you up, this part comes for Aunt Danielle and Grandma Lady about love.\" Scruffy groaned again while Dot looked interested. Danielle had been acting strange lately which worried her parents until Lady decided to have a talk with her. She didn't eat much anymore, she seemed to stare off into space more often, she seemed to lay around the house more than usual, and didn't even go to chase some cats that would pass their house once in a while. \"Danielle, are you okay?\" Lady asked. \"I'm not sure, Mom...\" Danielle said. \"I don't know how to explain it, but... I feel funny... Funny weird, not like, funny haha...\" \"Hmm...\" Lady hummed, thinking based on her tomboy daughter's behavior. \"Does it feel like someone punched you in the stomach?\" \"A little bit...\" Danielle said. \"Oh, sweetie, I think you're experiencing your first crush!\" Lady smiled. \"I... I am...?\" Danielle asked her mother. \"I believe so...\" Lady smiled. \"Oh, gross, I'm in love!\" Danielle grunted. \"Make it stop, Mom!\" \"I'm afraid I can't.\" Lady giggled. \"Ugh, this sucks.\" Danielle grumbled. \"Danielle, being in love is a wonderful thing,\" Lady smiled. \"If we didn't have love, you wouldn't be here right now.\" \"I guess that's right.\" Danielle said. \"So, who's the other dog?\" Lady asked. \"Um, his name's Copper.\" Danielle replied honestly. \"Aw!\" Lady smiled. Danielle blushed to her mother, but then smiled back to her.[Chapter 3] The next day soon came. At Widow Tweed's place, Tod was looking out the window as he was inside. \"Poor little tyke,\" Widow Tweed frowned in sympathy as she cooked on the stove. \"It's a shame I have to keep him cooped up.\" Tod began to scratch at the door slightly, wanting to be let out. \"Tod, stop looking at me like that,\" Widow Tweed lightly chuckled to her fox kit. \"It's not my fault, you know. You caused a lot of trouble yesterday.\" Tod frowned as she was right, then heard some barking outside and climbed into her chair to take a closer look. \"Oh, now what are they up to?!\" Widow Tweed groaned as she shoved the ladle back into her pot before going over to the window, and saw that Amos was loading up things into his car before going back to her stove. \"Huh! Why it looks like Amos is goin' on a huntin' trip. A long one from the looks of it. Hmph. Well, good riddance.\" Tod looked sad as that meant he wouldn't see Copper for a long time. He looked back to his human as she cooked on the stove and soon snuck out the window so he could see the hound dog at least for a little while before he would go away. Chief was already in the car while Amos struggled to start it up. Soon enough, the car started. \"Well, Copper, me and old Chief are gonna teach you all about huntin',\" Amos smiled down to the young hound dog. \"It's about time too.\" \"Yes, sir!\" Copper barked with a smile back since Amos was in a good mood right now as he soon got into the car. \"Attaboy,\" Amos chuckled as he let Copper into the car. \"Yeah, you're gonna like trackin' down those varmints for me.\" Copper barked excitedly and tried to sit in the front seat. \"Uh-uh! Get in the back, half-pint,\" Chief shook his head at Copper. \"You gotta earn your right to sit up front.\" Copper frowned slightly, then hopped into the back. Chief was happy that Copper understood. Patch and the others were also coming over to check on things as Tod was trying to get to Copper before he would leave. \"C-C-Copper's leaving...?\" Danielle asked shakily, she had her fur done just so she could impress the hound dog she had secret feelings for. \"Yeah.\" Tod frowned. Copper struggled with the back-seat since he was lying on a crate. \"Well, boys,\" Amos told his dogs as he drove them away from home. \"We're gettin' outta here 'til next Spring.\" Tod and the others soon arrived too late. Copper quietly and sadly howled to the others as he rode off. \"Tod, honey, what are you doing over here?\" Big Mama asked as she flew over. \"Gee, I just wanted to say goodbye to Copper,\" Tod frowned sadly. \"But I'm too late.\" \"Same with us.\" Danielle frowned back to him. \"Well, what did you plan to do if you ran into old Chief?\" Big Mama replied. \"Aw, Chief,\" Tod narrowed his eyes. \"I can outfox that dumb old dog any time, besides, even Patch is stronger than he is.\" \"Tod! Now hold it just one minute!\" Big Mama shook her head before lecturing the fox kit. \"Didn't you learn anything yesterday? Now you listen good, Tod. Because it's either education or elimination!\" \"She's right, Tod.\" Patch admitted. Tod simply looked to them all in a confused manner. \"Now if you're so foxy and old Chief's so dumb, then why does the hound get the fox on the run? Because he's got the hunter, and the hunter's got the gun. Kablam! Elimination. Lack of Education,\" Big Mama advised as she flew and landed on a fence. \" If you pal around with that Copper hound, you'll wind up hangin' on the wall. Keep your nose to the wind, and you'll keep your skin. 'Cuz you won't be home when the hunter comes to call!\" \"Oh, Big Mama,\" Tod shook his head to the owl. \"I know Copper would never track me down. Why old Copper, he's my best friend!\" \"That's right.\" Danielle said. \"Your best friend!\" Big Mama said to Tod. \"Now Copper's gonna do what he's been told. Suppose to chase a little fox into an old foxhole. Then along comes a hunter with a buckshot load...\" The two birds, Dinky the Finch and Boomer the Woodpecker helped Big Mama explain that Copper would probably forget about being friends with Tod by the time he would come back home. The pups didn't agree though. \"Not my friend Copper,\" Tod frowned. \"He won't ever change.\" \"I hope you're right, Tod.\" Big Mama soothed the fox kit. \"And we'll keep on being friends forever,\" Tod continued. \"Won't we, Big Mama?\" \"Darlin', forever is a long, long time,\" Big Mama told him. \"And time has a way of changin' things.\" \"And we animals do age over the months.\" Patch said. Tod didn't want to believe that Copper would change too much the next time he would see him. Dot frowned as she looked sad for Tod, even if this was just a story from the past. \"Let's fast forward a few dog years.\" Patch said. \"This is so sad for Uncle Tod though...\" Dot whimpered. \"Why does Uncle Copper have to hate him just cuz he's a fox?\" \"He doesn't and he didn't back then, but, um, let's just say he grew a hatred later on,\" Patch said. \"Anyway, fast forwarding to a few dog years in the story.\" Dot was a little unsure about that. The seasons came and went, but soon, the puppies had grown up into bigger dogs, and Tod was now a full grown fox. Atticus raked the last of the old leaves in the yard. Patch came out of the house. \"Are you gonna jump?\" Atticus asked suspiciously. \"I've grown up.\" Patch told him. \"Just checking...\" Atticus chuckled and continued to rake the leaves. \"Hey, it's Spring; that means Copper's coming back.\" Patch smiled before running off to the others. \"See ya later, Patch!\" Atticus called out. \"See ya!\" Patch called back as he went to join the others. Danielle seemed different again, she was a lot more feminine. She still had her tomboy moments, but she seemed to be more eager about taking baths and getting groomed like her mother and sisters, though Angel still seemed to hate that, and so did Scamp, but he did grow to tolerate having to do them. \"Danielle, you look perfect.\" Annette smiled. \"Really perfect.\" Colette agreed. \"Don't push it.\" Danielle said, but giggled with them. Patch soon arrived at their house. \"Hi, Patch!\" The family greeted. \"Hey, guys,\" Patch smiled. \"Wow, Danielle, you kinda look pretty.\" \"Don't get too excited.\" Danielle smirked as she fluffed up her ears which had white hair bows that matched her collar. \"You know what happens today, right?\" Patch asked. \"Copper's coming home, isn't he?\" Scamp asked. \"Yep,\" Patch smiled before smirking at Danielle. \"Is that why you got yourself all pretty?\" \"I've always been pretty.\" Danielle looked away, though blushed under her fur. \"She asked Mom for help.\" Colette whispered to her Dalmatian boyfriend. \"Ohh.\" Patch smiled. \"Let's get going.\" Danielle blushed. \"Right.\" The others agreed so that they could reunite with Copper, but on the way, they ran into Tod, who seemed to have a collar now. Of course, Big Mama, Dinky, and Boomer were coming back since it was now Spring and they had to leave for the winter. The female owl had then dumped some leaves on Tod without knowing it. \"Well, look who's here,\" The owl chuckled once she saw who it was. \"Oh, my goodness. Ha ha! I'm sorry, Tod honey. I hope-\" \"Hiya, Big Mama!\" Dinky smiled as he landed on the fence. \"We're back! We flew all the way!\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Boomer added, he sounded a bit like Runt from The Animaniacs. \"We did. We did.\" \"Hey, guys.\" Patch greeted the birds. \"Aw, looks like you all had a growth spurt too.\" Big Mama smiled to the former puppy dogs. \"We sure did.\" Scamp smiled. \"Hi, fellas!\" Tod smiled to his bird friends. \"Hey! Who's that?!\" Boomer panicked at the adult male fox. \"Who's that?!\" \"Hey!\" Dinky glared down to Tod slightly. \"This can't be that scrawny little squirt we found by the fence post. Can it? Come on.\" \"Yep, it's him.\" Patch smiled. \"I can't believe my eyes!\" Boomer commented. \"It's me all right.\" Tod chuckled. \"Oh, Tod, your tail is so bushy and silky...\" Annette smiled. \"I wish I could get my fur to be soft and shiny like this.\" Boomer soon went to Tod's tail, though it was more of a teasing, playful way. \"Aw, come on,\" Tod chuckled to his bird friends. \"Cut it out. You guys are always teasing me.\" Widow Tweed soon came out the front door with a wilted plant in her hands and put it down on the bench. Patch sniffed the wilted plant to find out why the plant had wilted when it was inside from the cold. A caterpillar slithered out onto his nose. Patch soon looked cross-eyed once he saw the caterpillar. \"Hey, it's him! It's him! Squeeks!\" Dinky exclaimed before looking to Tod and the teenage dogs. \"We'll see ya later, guys. We gotta take care of some unfinished business.\" Patch saw Dinky and Boomer coming and knew why they thought the caterpillar was a worm. The caterpillar soon snuck away from the hungry woodpecker and finch. Patch soon went back to the others, already knowing the caterpillar could handle itself. Amos was heard singing as he was driving home with Copper and Chief, and Copper was even allowed sit up front as he had also grown up like the others, and where Patch and the others saw them coming. Danielle blushed even more when she saw how 'handsome' Copper looked as an older dog. \"Look, Copper's back.\" Scamp smiled. \"He has...\" Danielle whispered in amazement. \"Wow...\" \"Don't be afraid of rejection...\" Annette advised. \"Be strong, be brave, and be courageous.\" Danielle nodded out of determination. \"Gee, great to be home, huh, Chief?\" Copper smiled as he lapped up some water and scratched himself. \"Eh...\" Chief mumbled. Copper could tell something was upsetting Chief. The others soon came over as Copper talked with Chief. Danielle felt even more nervous and could feel her heart beating faster than when they were younger, and her legs started to buckle as she couldn't seem to go any further. \"Come on, Danielle, you haven't seen Copper in forever!\" Colette told her tomboy sister. Danielle gulped slightly. \"I know...\" Scamp soon gave Danielle a little push forward. Danielle blinked and looked back at her brother. Scamp kept pushing until he soon got Danielle close beside Copper and soon rushed off so that it could be the two of them, though Chief was there. \"Danielle, is that you?\" Copper asked the cocker spaniel. \"Uh, yeah, i-it's me.\" Danielle smiled nervously. \"You look... Different...\" Copper said. \"Are those bows?\" \"Oh, um, yes, they are...\" Danielle replied sheepishly. \"My mother thought they would bring out my eyes.\" \"They really do.\" Copper smiled. \"R-Really?\" Danielle smiled back. \"Yes, and you look gorgeous.\" Copper nodded. Danielle squealed quietly, almost like an anime character in love, though this was all in her head, but Copper's compliments and her speaking to him were real. \"So, what'd I miss?\" Copper asked. \"I think Chief's just a little jealous I got to track down the varmints from hunting.\" \"Patch met the Road Rovers.\" Danielle said. \"You did?!\" Copper asked. \"Oh, man, I thought they were just a myth!\" \"No, no, they're real,\" Danielle giggled. \"He told us all about the adventure he had with Hunter and Colleen.\" \"So lucky.\" Copper pouted. \"Patch is an amazing dog... Though, not as amazing as you , Copper,\" Danielle said as she put one paw down on his. \"I'm really glad you're back home.\" \"Me too.\" Copper smiled. The two dogs smiled to each other and even touched paws with each other as a dog's way of holding hands. The two of them soon went to sleep together. \"Should we wake them?\" Scamp whispered to the others. \"Nah, let them have their moment.\" Angel whispered back. \"All right.\" Scamp nodded. They soon gave the two dogs privacy to have their time alone together.[Chapter 4] Later on, Tod soon arrived. Copper and Danielle still seemed to be together until Copper sensed something. \"Copper?\" Tod whispered. \"Hey, Copper!\" Copper soon quietly got up and looked to see his best friend. The fox and the hound soon reunited after a long period of being away from each other, and they saw that each other had grown. \"Tod? I thought that was you I smelled you coming,\" Copper smiled quietly. \"My, you sure have grown.\" \"You have too, Copper,\" Tod smiled back. \"I saw you comin' back with Chief and the hunter.\" Copper seemed to frown about that before smiling again. \"It's great to see ya, Tod, but, you know, you. You shouldn't be over here. You're gonna get us both into a lot of trouble.\" Danielle began to stir as she could hear what was going on. Chief's snore was also heard which worried Copper. \"Hey, look, I-I just wanted to see ya,\" Tod said to Copper. \"We're still friends, aren't we?\" \"Tod... Those days are over,\" Copper frowned. \"I'm a huntin' dog now.\" Tod was surprised to hear this and looked sad that his best friend would say that, and where Danielle heard that too and where she wasn't happy to hear that. \"Y-You need to get out of here before Old Chief wakes up.\" Copper told Tod. \"Aw, gee...\" Tod sulked as his ears drooped. \"He doesn't worry me.\" Danielle soon woke up quietly. \"Chief, he doesn't worry me.\" Tod said softly. \"Tod, I'm serious,\" Copper told his best friend. \"Y-You're fair game as far as he's concerned.\" \"Yeah, but you won't let him hurt Tod, will you?\" Danielle asked Copper quietly. Chief soon barked loudly once he saw Tod which startled the fox away. \"I'm sorry, Danielle, but it's just business, you wouldn't understand.\" Copper told Danielle. Danielle gasped in response to that. She was about to leave until they saw light come from Amos's house. The tomboy cocker spaniel soon decided to go with them, feeling maybe Copper changed too much. The commotion was heard by Widow Tweed, Mo, Atticus, and Cherry. \"What was that?\" Cherry asked. \"I better go check it out.\" Atticus decided. Him, Mo, and Widow Tweed came out to see what was going on. Tod soon rushed to run off and hide before Amos or Chief could find him. Patch and the others soon joined him even if the strong dalmatian could take them on, he didn't want to become enemies with Copper. Copper found them until he was then called away. Atticus was soon heard calling out for Patch while Mo called for Scamp, Angel, and the cocker spaniel triplets. Patch and the others would have went to them, but didn't want Amos know where Tod was. Copper looked to them and looked broken inside. \"Guys, I... Tod, I don't wanna see you get killed...\" he then told his best friend. \"Track him down, boy!\" Amos called out to Copper. \"I'll let you go this one time.\" Copper told Tod before getting out of the way and howling to distract his human, and where Amos soon followed Copper away from the hiding spot. Tod soon took that as his cue to go. Tod and the dogs were soon on railroad tracks and began to run down them. Chief soon jumped out on the other side and barked aggressively towards Tod. \"Oh, why, Chief?!\" Danielle complained. Chief snarled to all of them. Patch snarled back as he stood in front of Tod for protection like a good, true friend would. \"Quick, Tod, run with the others while I handle Chief.\" Patch told him. \"Are you sure?\" Tod asked. \"Trust me!\" Patch told him. \"GO!\" Tod looked back at him and soon ran with the others. Colette winked to Patch before going with the others while Chief tried to tackle down Patch, only for him to be unable to tackle him down. \"Is that the best you got, you old dog?\" Patch growled. \"Why don't you just leave Tod alone?!\" \"Because he's a fox; as a dog, you should know that we hunt them down!\" Chief growled back. \"But he's Copper's friend!\" Patch defended. \"Foxes and hounds don't mix!\" Chief snapped. \"Well, me, Collette, Scamp, Angel, Annette, Danielle, Copper, and Tod have proven that wrong!\" Patch defended. \"Then you're a bunch of misfitted outcasts and you should be ashamed to call yerselves dogs!\" Chief glared. Patch continued to growl until he heard something coming on the train tracks. \"Don't be... Don't be... Don't be...\" The Dalmatian told himself until he slowly turned around and saw lights coming up followed by a train whistle. \"Aw, nuts!\" he then panicked and jumped down from the railroad to avoid getting hit by the train. Unfortunately, Chief didn't join him and got hit by the train. Dot yelped and ducked down, shivering. \"Dad... Did he... Um...?\" Scruffy stammered. \"I thought he had, but he actually made it.\" Patch replied. \"It reminded me a lot of when Uncle Trusty got hit by the dogcatcher's wagon on Christmas Eve.\" Lady added. \"Whew,\" Dot sighed. \"That's a relief.\" \"Trust me, I was scared too,\" Patch understood. \"But unfortunately, something else happened when me and the others looked down from the train tracks to see if Chief was still alive.\" Dot whimpered and looked scared again. \"Oh, there, there, honey, it'll be okay.\" Colette soothed her daughter. \"I-Is this the scary part?\" Dot asked nervously. \"Nope.\" Patch said. \"This story is really getting scary.\" Dot frowned. \"I'll let you know when it gets scary.\" Collette assured her daughter. Dot wiped her eyes and tried to stay brave. Back in the story, Copper came down to find Chief in the water, and he looked like he was almost dead. \"Chief...?\" The young hound dog frowned and tried to nudge him. \"Oh, no! No!\" Tod poked his head out as he looked sorry for both Copper and Chief. Copper soon looked up at the train track and soon saw Tod and the others and where he looked enraged. \" TOD! IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO, I'LL GET YOU FOR THIS! \" The hound dog threatened his best friend, blaming him for Chief's demise. Meanwhile with the others... Cherry shivered as she walked with Atticus and Mo to find their missing dogs while Widow Tweed was looking for her missing fox. \"Oh, where could they be?\" she asked as she was getting too cold. \"Goodness knows!\" Widow Tweed replied. \"We've searched every last corner.\" \"This is dreadful.\" Mo pouted. They soon heard something coming. \"Someone's coming!\" Cherry told the others, getting into a slight fighting stance. \"Who's there? I know karate!...On the Wii.\" Tod soon came out and rushed towards Widow Tweed and had Patch with the other dogs with him. \"Oh, thank goodness.\" Atticus sighed. \"Sorry, guys, we got caught up in something, and it wasn't good.\" Patch told their owners. \"Come on, let's go home, we'll talk about this later.\" Mo decided since it was rather late. \"All right.\" The dogs sighed. They soon went home to be safe and sound. Also, since it was dark outside, Atticus, Mo, Cherry, and the pets stayed with Tod and Widow Tweed. They were soon inside which was nice and warm. Cherry wiped her nose with a sniffle. \"I think I caught a cold from being outside too long.\" She then told the others with a stuffed up nose. \"This calls for some magic chicken soup.\" Atticus said to Cherry. Cherry sniffled and coughed as she hated being sick. Soon enough, Atticus brought out the magic chicken soup and gave it to Cherry. After sometime, Tod and the others were asleep. Cherry slurped down the chicken soup and was instantly cured due to the magical ingredients as it was no ordinary chicken soup. \"I'm so glad you're safe...\" Mo whispered with a tear in her eye as she hugged Angel. Angel smiled that she was back in Mo's arms until she smelled a familiar scent and started barking. \"What is it, girl?\" Mo asked her dog. Patch, Collette, Annette, Danielle, and Tod smelled the something and where Tod was hiding while Patch and the other joined in the barking. \"What is going on?!\" Cherry's voice called out during The Twilight Bark. The answer to that question was soon heard as there was a loud knocking sound at Widow Tweed's front door. Cherry groaned, covering her ears from agony of the loud knocking. \"What on Earth?!\" Widow Tweed glared before she soon went to get the door. \" WIDOW! GET OUT HERE! \" Amos's voice demanded. Widow Tweed soon opened the door to see Amos. \"Why, Amos, what're you-\" \"Where is he?\" Amos glared at her. \"Where is he?! I know he's in there!\" \"What's going on?\" Mo asked. Angel whimpered and whined slightly. \"It's that hunter again!\" Scamp snapped. \"What do you want?!\" Atticus glared at Amos. \"Where is he?\" Amos glared back. \"Where is who?\" Atticus glared back, not backing down. \"You know who!\" Amos glared. \"That confounded fox! He almost killed Chief, and I'm gonna get him! You all can't keep him locked up forever!\" \"Tod didn't do anything wrong!\" Atticus glared back. \"And neither did Patch or the other dogs!\" \"That's right!\" Mo added. Big Mama, Boomer, and Dinky all looked concerned as they heard this from a tree branch not too far away. Widow Tweed had to admit that Amos was partly right, but she didn't show any sign of weakness while Tod hid away. \"Ms. Tweed, what do we do?\" Mo asked. \"It breaks my heart, but... I think it's time to let Tod go...\" Widow Tweed said in a somber voice. Atticus, Mo, and Cherry knew how hard this was going to be for her.\"Oh, it's hard to imagine I once had a life before Tod came into it,\" Widow Tweed mused to the children. \"I've had quite a lonesome life ever since my husband passed away.\" \"We know how hard this is going to be.\" Cherry said. \"Trust me, it will...\" Widow Tweed frowned softly. \"Would you mind if we helped?\" Mo asked. \"Oh, I couldn't make you all do that...\" Widow Tweed smiled sadly. \"We want to.\" Cherry said. \"Well... All right... Why don't you go home, get some sleep, and meet me here in the morning?\" Widow Tweed suggested. \"Yes, ma'am.\" Mo said. Everyone agreed to this and decided to get some sleep while Widow Tweed prepared to send Tod away into the wild which felt very heartbreaking for her. \"This reminds me of the movie with the bear that JJ wanted to watch when I babysat him the other night.\" Mo said softly.[Chapter 5] The next day soon came. Cherry groaned as she woke up early, but she soon went to get ready to join the others so they could take Tod back into the wild where he belonged and so that Amos would stop bothering and blaming him. Patch, Collette, Scamp, Annette, and Danielle were even going with them. Widow Tweed came out of her house with Tod and saw the others had come right on time. Tod smiled innocently as he had no idea what was going to happen to him today. \"Well, here we go.\" Mo frowned. \"I wonder where we're going?\" Tod smiled. \"I just love riding in the car!\" Patch and the others weren't sure how to tell him. Widow Tweed smiled at Tod, trying to keep strong, but on the inside, she was quite emotional. They drove to a deep part of the forest. Tod was just excited to be in the car, but soon, his happiness would deteriorate into sadness. Tod soon saw that Widow Tweed looked sad and did what he could to comfort her, not sure why she was sad though. Eventually, Widow Tweed stopped her car and carried Tod in her arms and came to drop him off in the forest. Atticus and the others soon joined them. Even Cherry looked a little sad by this sight. Tod smiled all around until he saw the sad, grim faces on everyone else. Widow Tweed soon set him down, removed his collar, and gave him one last hug. Everyone else did the same thing to Tod. Widow Tweed soon got up to go and Tod was about to follow her, but she made it clear that she didn't want him to follow her. Tod looked so curious and confused as Widow Tweed went back into her car to drive back home and make Tod stay behind. Atticus and the others knew this was for the best. Widow Tweed looked back one last time as she drove back home while Tod would stay here. And of course, to make things worse, the wind began to blow and it began to drizzle. \"Sh-She left me...\" Tod said in sadness before going to lay under a tree for shelter. Patch and the others felt horrible for leaving Tod in the woods alone. \"Should we stay with him to help?\" Scamp asked. \"I feel like maybe we should...\" Patch replied. \"Well, he has been with Widow Tweed almost all his life.\" Collette said. \"So, we're staying in the woods?\" Angel asked. \"Just until Tod can get on his feet.\" Danielle nodded, trying to use an expression. \"Eh, close enough.\" Patch said to the tomboy cocker spaniel. Tod was trying to look around for a shelter to stay in as it rained, seeing the other animals do that. He soon saw what looked like that could be perfect shelter. \"Poor Tod must be so confused and lost.\" Annette frowned. Tod hid into the place he found only to get pushed out. \"Hold it, sonny, back off!\" A badger glared at Tod. \"Consarn it! Where? Where do you think you're goin'?\" Patch and the others soon came to Tod's aide. \"O-Oh, excuse me,\" Tod nervously told the angry badger. \"I-I-I was just trying to-\" \"You barge in on somebody's house like you own it,\" The badger glared as a porcupine walked by. \"Tarryhootin' around them woods, wakin' up folks in the middle of the night.\" \"He didn't know it was your home, sir.\" Patch told the badger. \"Oh, all of you, get off my property!\" The badger glared. \"Come on, beat it!\" \"I've been watching you all,\" The porcupine smiled. \"You can stay with me if you want to.\" \"Thank you.\" Angel smiled back. \"How very nice of you.\" Scamp added. \"Come with me.\" The porcupine smiled back, and led them into his home. The fox and the dogs soon followed after the kind porcupine. \"Though while we were sleeping in the woods, Amos had something in mind for Tod.\" Patch's voice said. Scruffy and Dot gulped about that. The dogs went to sleep with Tod and the porcupine for the night, they were sure that their owners would be all right without them, besides, they already talked about this before Widow Tweed came to drop them off. \"I thought Uncle Tod was gonna live with his Uncle Nick and Aunt Judy?\" Scruffy asked his parents. \"Well, if he did, then how would he have met your Aunt Vixey?\" Collette asked before covering her mouth playfully. \"What?!\" Scruffy and Dot asked. \"I'm confused... So... Is this before or after Nick and Judy?\" Scruffy asked. \"After,\" Patch said. \"They are even in this story.\" \"Oh... Okay... Sorry... I just couldn't help but think about them.\" Scruffy smiled sheepishly. Back in the story, Tod and the other dogs were fast asleep with the porcupine for the cold and rainy night. Danielle couldn't help but think about Copper, showing that she really missed him and even dreamed about him. Tod was soon quickly uncomfortable due to the porcupine's quills which seemed to wake him up. \"Tod?!\" Patch asked as he suddenly woke up. Colette woke up right after him, almost like instinctively. Scamp, Annette, and Danielle soon woke up next. \"Uh, you okay, Tod?\" Patch winced for the fox's pain. \"That porcupine kinda got too close...\" Tod winced from the sharp quills as he was soon about to take a walk out. \"Oh, Tod, be careful!\" Annette warned. Unfortunately, Tod had fell from where they were and back into where he tried to walk into. \"Oh, no...\" The dogs frowned as they knew what that meant. Tod was soon pushed out of the way by brute force. \"So, it's you again?\" The badger glared at the fox. \"You barged in on me last night, and now you-\" \"He didn't mean to land in your home.\" Patch interrupted. \"Just look at the mess you made,\" The badger scolded. \"Dagnabit, you clumsy bonehead!\" \"I'm sorry,\" Tod frowned as he fell into a small puddle of water. \"It was just an accident.\" \"Excuses! Excuses!\" The badger shook his head. \"It was so an accident!\" The dogs barked as they arrived at the bottom. \"Uh, Mr. Digger, sir?\" The porcupine even defended Tod. \"It was so too an accident!\" \"You keep outta this, you walking pin cushion!\" The badger glared up at the porcupine. \"You shouldn't be so grumpy to someone who's new in the neighborhood.\" The porcupine advised, even though he was hiding. \"That's right!\" The dogs agreed. \"A stranger, huh?\" The badger snarled before glaring at Tod. \"Why don't you go back where you came from?!\" Tod felt so angry, sad, and confused all at once that he couldn't properly respond to that since Widow Tweed 'abandoned' him, so he simply walked away from the cranky old badger. \"Well, go on, get goin', git!\" The badger glared to Tod like he was useless. Scamp was about to do something to the badger's home for how he treated Tod. \"Scamp, don't, he's not worth our time.\" Angel told her boyfriend. \"Dang it.\" Scamp groaned. \"Come on, let's just go, he is a grouch though.\" Angel replied. Scamp firmly nodded as they soon walked together. Tod sulked as he felt miserable to be in the forest and wanted to go back home, but he wouldn't be allowed to. Patch soon saw four figures. \"Patch?\" Colette asked. \"I think we have company.\" Patch told his girlfriend. Of course, Patch was right, and he even recognized, well, three of the figures, but the final one didn't seem familiar at all to him. Tod looked absolutely miserable that he didn't even see the four figures just yet. \"Oh... And who do we have here?\" Danielle asked the figures who came from the bushes. \"I'm Vixey, and is that sad fox over there, Tod?\" The female fox asked them. \"Yes, this is our friend, Tod.\" Danielle nodded to the young female fox who was around Tod's age. \"Big Mama said I should come over and help cheer him up.\" Vixey told the others. Big Mama and a familiar bunny and the rest of the female dogs soon had an idea. \"Oh, you guys, I don't know...\" Vixey giggled. \"Now, don't worry about it, besides, you look beautiful.\" Judy smiled. \"Thank you~\" Vixey giggled to the girls who helped her. Big Mama and the others soon went over to Tod and where this would be a surprise for him to see Nick and Judy and later on, would surprise him with their engagement.[Chapter 6] \"Morning, Tod!\" Big Mama smiled to the male fox. \"Oh, hello, Big Mama.\" Tod replied miserably. \"Hey, kiddo.\" Nick smiled. \"Huh?\" Tod asked before looking to the older male fox. \"U-Uncle Nick?\" \"You look a little down.\" Nick said. \"Well... I am...\" Tod sighed softly. \"Widow left me.\" \"Ooh, that's tough.\" Nick winced. \"I don't know why she did... Maybe I was too much trouble...\" Tod frowned. \"Oh, I don't believe that,\" Nick told him. \"Unlike me, kid, you were always very well-behaved, sweet, and helpful... I was a bit of a troublemaker as a kid, if you can believe that.\" \"I did my research on humans and it says that humans usually set most animals who belong out in the wild/woods back into the woods so they can learn how to fend for themselves.\" Judy spoke up. \"Aunt Judy?\" Tod asked. \"You're here too?\" Nick and Judy smiled and nodded together to the former young fox kit. \"But what about Zootopia?\" Tod asked them. \"We got some vacation time.\" Nick said. \"Well, I'm really glad to see you guys,\" Tod smiled wearily. \"At least somebody still loves me.\" \"Ah, Tod, your human loves you,\" Judy soothed. \"She did this because she loves you!\" Tod frowned, not feeling too sure about that. Big Mama soon decided to move the plan along. Vixey soon stood against the sunlight which soon attracted Tod. \"Whoa... W-Who i-is that...?\" Tod whispered. \"Oh, just another fox,\" Big Mama smiled as she cleaned him up while he was astonished at the vixen. \"A lady fox~\" \"Golly, is she beautiful,\" Toes smiled. \"I-I wonder what her name is.\" \"Well, why don't you go ask her?\" Big Mama smirked slightly. \"Y-Yeah... Guess... Guess I will...\" Tod said as he soon came toward the beautiful vixen. 'The plan's working.' Judy thought to herself. \"I'll go up to her and I'll say, 'You're the most gorgeous',\" Tod recited to himself as he walked up to Vixey. \"'The most beautiful. Never seen anyone, anywhere'... I'll say... Hi.\" \"Hello.\" Vixey smiled. The two then accidentally talked over each other which made them both laugh. 'Love.' Patch thought to himself. \"May I call you by your first name?\" Tod asked shyly. \"Oh, oh, sure, why not?\" Vixey smiled. \"Thanks... W-What is your first name?\" Tod smiled back. \"Vixey.\" The female fox replied. \"Vixey,\" Tod smiled out of love. \"My name is, uh, T-Tod.\" \"Tod?\" Vixey smiled back. \"That's a nice name... Tod...\" \"Isn't it beautiful, Nick?\" Judy smiled. \"It sure does, Carrots.\" Nick smiled back, still giving her that nickname. \"So romantic.\" Collette sighed. Patch smiled, laying against her slightly. Scamp and Angel did the same. Danielle frowned as she thought about Copper, feeling left out right now. Big Mama felt happy that Tod and Vixey were together. \"Say, it looks like that farm boy is makin' it big with her.\" Boomer chuckled. \"Now just keep it down!\" Big Mama whispered loudly as she closed his beak. \"Well, Tod, you know something?\" Vixey smiled to Tod as she looked down into the water. \"This stream is just full of trout. Do you think you could catch one?\" \"One what?\" Tod asked while still in love. \"One what?\" Vixey repeated with a giggle. \"Fish, silly!\" \"Oh, oh, yeah!\" Tod replied. \"Oh, yeah. My dear young lady, you happen to be looking at an expert fisher fox.\" \"Well, I believe he's your nephew now.\" Judy teased Nick. \"He's about to embarrass himself.\" Patch face-pawed. Tod leapt onto a log in the stream. \"I know all the tricks. In fact, I never miss.\" \"This can only end so well.\" Annette deadpanned slightly. \"Oh, here comes a whopper, now, watch closely!\" Tod grinned to the big fish to show Vixey what he could do and slammed his paw into the water, accidentally splashing the vixen. He soon tried to get the fish only to keep on missing. \"Tod, do you need help?\" Vixey offered. \"No. No, I do it this way all all the all the time!\" Tod smiled, though he kept missing the fish. \"I got him.\" He only seemed to have caught a stick instead of the fish and which was funny. \"Oh, that farm boy, he don't know nothin' about fishin'!\" Boomer laughed. Dinky soon laughed with the woodpecker and Tod looked into his mouth and spit out the stick. Not even Vixey could resist laughing. \"Go ahead, go ahead, and laugh!\" Tod glared as tried to swim out of the water. \"You're like everyone else around here!\" Patch and the others tried to resist the urge to laugh. \"Oh, Tod, sorry, I can't help it,\" Vixey giggled. \"You are so funny!\" \"So, I can't fish!\" Tod glared since he didn't like being laughed at. \"You're a silly, empty-headed female!\" \"What did you call her?!\" Annette, Collette, Danielle, and Judy glared. \"Now just a minute,\" Vixey glared. \"I mean, you've got a nerve. Why don't you grow up?\" \"Tod, that's no way to talk to Vixey.\" Big Mama scolded. \"Oh, raspberries; I've had it!\" Tod glared as he dripped. 'Oh, this is bad.' Scamp thought to himself. \"Kiddo, I know things seem tough, but you can't get mad like that.\" Nick advised his grown nephew. \"He's right.\" Patch said. \"You have to be natural.\" Annette advised. \"That's the trick.\" Big Mama agreed. Vixey looked back at Tod, but turned away, still mad at him. Tod looked still angry with Vixey, but found himself unable to stay mad at her. He soon came into a field of flowers and decided to pick one. \"That's the power of love~\" Patch randomly sang before chuckling. Tod soon tried to offer the flower to Vixey. Vixey soon turned her head away from him. Eventually, she sniffed the flower and she let out a sneeze. Tod also sneezed, dropping the flower. Vixey soon forgave him and nuzzled up against him. \"Aw!\" The girls smiled. Big Mama then shooed away Boomer and Dinky so that Tod and Vixey could be alone. Patch and the others soon did the same thing. \"So, this is the famous Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde?\" Annette asked. \"That's them all right,\" Patch smiled. \"Judy is the first bunny cop, and Nick helps her out in the ZPD.\" \"It's true.\" Nick said. \"So, what?\" Annette asked Judy. \"Can rabbits not be cops in the world?\" \"Well, it's mostly a job for a bigger animal, so no one really took me seriously when I moved into Zootopia.\" Judy told her. \"Really?\" Danielle asked. \"Oh, yes,\" Judy smiled. \"It's quite an amazing story. No one back home thought I could do it, but I've always believed in myself! Like my favorite pop singer Gazelle always says 'Try Everything'.\" Nick and Judy began to tell them everyone. Tod and Vixey soon began to bond with each other in the forest. \"And that's how your Uncle Tod met your Aunt Vixey.\" Colette smiled to Scruffy and Dot. \"Aw!\" Dot smiled. \"Yawn.\" Scruffy muttered. \"Aw, come on, Scruffy, every story needs a break from tension.\" Patch told his son. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\" Scruffy rolled his eyes. Patch and Collette just sighed to their son before continuing the story. \"And so, Nick signed up and joined the force to be with me, and we've been partners ever since.\" Judy soon concluded her story to the dogs who weren't there. \"Is that a ring a see?\" Collette asked Judy as she saw her wearing an engagement ring. \"So, you've noticed.\" Judy smiled. \"You mean... You and Nick...?\" Patch asked. Judy nodded happily. \"When did you two get engaged?\" Scamp asked. \"Well, that's another interesting story,\" Judy replied in great detail, almost like the others could picture this happening in their minds. \"There was a robbery in a Honey Bank about two months ago with vicious bees and a bear bank teller was held hostage. I decided to go in, though the others warned me it might be dangerous, but I wasn't going to let anyone stop me, now that I became the world's first bunny cop. However, it did get too dangerous, and soon enough, Nick came to help me. I was a little hurt from the stinging, but nothing too severe. Nick took my paw and helped me and he was so relieved that I was okay. We shared a hug, and he soon got down on one knee and revealed this ring to me and asked me the question I never thought I would hear in my life.\" \"I asked her to make me the happiest fox in the world and marry me.\" Nick smiled. Judy smiled back, turning pink in her fuzzy cheeks slightly. The others smiled to that as they 'oohed' and chuckled for the future happy couple. \"So, I'm guessing you two want to ask Tod to either be the ring bearer or the best man?\" Patch guessed. \"Well, since he's a bit too old to be a ring bearer, I suppose he could be my best man,\" Nick replied. \"He's a much better buddy than Finnick was.\" \"What ever happened to him?\" Patch asked. \"I never really saw him again after I joined the ZPD.\" Nick shrugged. \"Guess he didn't want the cops to bust him for any illegal things he might do.\" Scamp said. \"That was always my guess.\" Nick nodded. Later on, Tod and Vixey came back as they shared alone time together, seeming almost like soulmates. \"Aw!\" The girls smiled. \"Danielle, you've grown up so much,\" Annette smiled to her tomboy sister. \"You usually hate this love stuff!\" \"I know, right?\" Danielle smiled back. \"Aw, our Dani's all grown up~\" Colette added. \"Shut up!\" Danielle blushed. Colette, Annette, and Angel just giggled to that. \"While we were all now having a good time; Amos and Copper began to make their way to where we were.\" Patch's voice narrated. \"Is this the scary part?!\" Dot begged to know. \"Nope,\" Collette said. \"Not yet.\" \"Oh, when will it be there already?\" Dot groaned. \"The suspense is hurting me!\" \"Keep telling the story.\" Scruffy said as he frowned and tried to comfort his sister, even if the love story part of the story was boring him. \"Should we go home now?\" Angel asked as Tod and Vixey were running through a field together in perfect harmony. \"Not sure.\" Collette said. \"It looks good to go, but something tells me something will happen later that'll be big.\" Patch replied. \"Well, if Patch says we should stay, I think we should stay.\" Collette said to her siblings since she was the closest to Patch. \"Okay.\" Scamp said. Patch walked around the forest with the others, though Collette stayed beside him just to keep safe. \"Ya seem like a forest survivalist, Patch.\" Danielle said. \"What can I say?\" Patch replied. \"Adventures help out.\" \"Yeah, I can see that.\" Scamp agreed. \"Say, didn't you guys get lost in a forest once?\" Danielle asked Patch and Collette. \"Um... Well... Not that lost...\" Patch smiled sheepishly. \"We were just helping out The Buddies.\" \"Yeah.\" Collette added. \"How very reassuring.\" Annette deadpanned. Collette looked firm to her older sister. \"I think it sounds cool!\" Danielle beamed. \"Same here.\" Angel said. \"I didn't want an adventure.\" Annette mumbled.' \"Aw, come on, Anne, step out of your comfort zone,\" Danielle smiled, showing her true tomboy side. \"I love rollin' around in dirt, gettin' chased, and sleeping on the ground!\" \"You take so much after Dad.\" Annette rolled her eyes. \"I sure do.\" Danielle smiled. \"Oy...\" Annette sighed as she missed home already due to being a prim and proper dog like Lady was, though a little bit of before when she met Tramp. Nick and Judy walked together, but heard something in the distance and soon hid as they saw a certain human who had metal traps. \"That's not good.\" Nick whispered. \"I can't believe some humans actually hunt us like they're criminal predators.\" Judy whispered back. \"We better warn the others.\" Nick whispered back. Judy nodded and followed Nick away from Amos as he laid out dangerous hunting traps. Amos soon took his gun and hid away while Copper sniffed out any possible prey, and where he could smell a familiar scent of Tod. \"Have you kids seen Tod?\" Nick asked the dogs. \"Oh, um, sorry, Mr. Wilde, but we've let him and Vixey be alone together.\" Collette replied. \"This could be bad!\" Nick panicked. \"Why?\" Angel asked. \"We saw these sharp metal things and this human laid them out for Tod.\" Judy replied. \"Human... Sharp Metal Things...\" Patch muttered until his eyes widened. \"Slade! He's back!\" \"And those metal things must be cages or bear traps.\" Collette gulped. \"Where did you last see Tod?!\" Nick yelped. \"Hmm... I saw him and Vixey go by the meadow, but...\" Scamp replied only to shrug. \"Oh, I can't lose Tod!\" Nick cried out. \"I already lost his mother, I can't risk losing him!\" Patch and the others began to sniff for Tod. Nick panicked and looked quite, quite paranoid. \"It'll be all right, Nick, I'm sure it will be.\" Judy soothed as she took his paw, gently squeezing it. \"You're probably right.\" Nick said. \"It'll be all right.\" Judy soothed. Nick soon took a deep breath and put his other paw on top of Judy's paw holding his. \"We should go find them.\" Scamp said. \"Come on then, they couldn't have gone too far.\" Patch replied. They soon went off to find Tod and/or Vixey so it wouldn't be too late.[Chapter 7] They searched for a little while until they found them watching a duck and some ducklings walking by. \"Hello, duckies...\" Danielle cooed with a small smile. \"A duck walked up to a lemonade stand, And he said to the man, running the stand, 'Hey! Got any grapes'?~\" she then randomly sang from one of Junior's childhood favorite nursery rhymes. Hearing this caused the duck and ducklings to look confused. \"Uh, have you guys seen a couple of foxes around here?\" Collette asked the duck family. The duck family soon pointed to the fox couple next to them. \"Heh... Thanks.\" Collette smiled. The duck in front nodded with a smile back \"Hey, guys.\" Tod smiled. \"Tod, thank Gabriel you're all right.\" Patch gasped. \"Uh, yeah, of course I am, why wouldn't I be?\" Tod asked the Dalmatian. \"Amos Slade is here and so is Copper.\" Patch told him. \"What?\" Tod asked. \"Are you sure?\" \"Judy and I saw them along with some bear traps.\" Nick said. \"Uh, b-bear traps...?\" Tod asked nervously. \"We're sorry, Tod, but we had to tell you.\" Judy replied as her ears drooped down in worry for him. \"Maybe we should go somewhere safe.\" Vixey frowned. Tod looked torn on what to do. \"Come on, let's go this way, kid, I wanna talk to you about something anyway.\" Nick told Tod. \"Um, okay.\" Tod said. \"Come on, this way.\" Nick told his nephew. Tod looked back, but soon followed the others away out of Amos's trap, and which was a good thing. \"What is going on?\" Vixey asked. \"Hunters, trust me, this way.\" Nick urged. Judy nodded in agreement with him. There was a light growling heard in the background. \"Uh-oh...\" Scamp gulped. \"D-Did you hear that?\" Angel asked him. \"It almost makes me think of Reggie.\" \"Yeah, but luckily it's not.\" Scamp gulped, remembering that all too well. \"Then it must be...\" Danielle gulped before looking to see who it was. Copper soon came out, looking aggressive and angry which made Tod react the same way. The two looked more like natural enemies now. \"Tod, wait, let me try to talk with him.\" Danielle begged the fox. Tod growled before looking to the tomboy cocker spaniel. Danielle had dewy eyes as she looked into his eyes. Tod then stepped down and let Danielle talk with Copper. \"Copper, please, don't do this.\" Danielle begged the hound dog. \"D-Danielle...?\" Copper softly asked the tomboy cocker spaniel. \"Copper, please, Tod's your best friend,\" Danielle begged. \"Please don't fight him or hurt him.\" \"I'm sorry, but I have to fight him,\" Copper said. \"Tod hurt Chief... You all did on the train tracks.\" \"Not exactly,\" Patch told him. \"He was hit by a train that was coming.\" \"What?!\" Copper asked. \"It's true, you just happened to see the wrong end of it...\" Danielle said. \"I'm really sorry, Copper, but Tod, and the others, and me didn't do anything.\" \"It's true.\" Annette said. Copper merely glared at them. \"You have to believe us...\" Danielle said softly to him before nuzzling up against him. \"We would never lie to you.\" Copper glared, but he looked into Danielle's eyes as she looked sullen to him. He then seemed to soften up a little bit since she was begging to him. \"So, did Uncle Copper believe Aunt Danielle?\" Dot's voice asked. \"He did, with the power of love, though, it wasn't so easy for Mr. Slade.\" Patch's voice replied. Amos had his gun aimed for Tod and began to shoot. \"This way!\" Vixey told him as she led him away to get away from the gunshots. Tod soon followed after her. Vixey led them into a burrow where they could all hide away from the hunter. \"Oh, Patch, I don't like guns.\" Collette cried. \"Oh, don't cry...\" Patch frowned to her, but eventually, Collette cried as she felt very emotional and depressed about the use of a gun. \"Let me guess, this will be your home?\" Nick asked Tod and Vixey. \"We were thinking about it, after all, this is where I live.\" Vixey replied. \"The forest does look beautiful when a hunter isn't trying to hunt us down.\" Judy said. \"Glad ya think so, Carrots.\" Nick smiled. \"You guys will be able to live here, because we'll make sure of it.\" Patch promised, trying to sound as brave and heroic as his father. \"Does anyone else smell fire?\" Collette asked as she smelled smoke. \"F-Fire...?\" Patch's eyes widened. Flames soon came into the burrow to scare them all out. \"Guys, we're trapped!\" Vixey gasped and coughed. \"Tod, I'm scared!\" \"We'll have to try and jump through it.\" Angel coughed. \"J-Jump?\" Vixey asked. \"Come on, Vixey, this is our only chance!\" Tod told her. They soon jumped through and where Amos was surprised by this. However, one didn't make it out. \"I don't believe it!\" Amos gasped. \"Copper, go get 'em!\" \"Danielle...\" Copper whispered to himself. \"She's still in there...\" Copper soon jumped in and rescued Danielle. One of Danielle's bows got caught in something, making her stuck in the burrow. Copper coughed a bit and soon bit onto Danielle's collar to drag her out to safety. She was soon able to breathe once she was put of the burrow. Copper gently splashed some water on her. Danielle coughed again and looked up wearily and bleary-eyed to the hound dog. \"Copper...?\" she asked softly. \"Thank goodness.\" Copper sighed. \"I got stuck...\" Danielle said softly. \"I'm so sorry...\" Copper replied as he nuzzled against her. \"It's all right now.\" Danielle smiled as the Copper she loved was back. Copper smiled back, he soon felt something deep inside of himself and felt quite different around Danielle. Danielle and Copper soon caught the scent of something big and furry coming. \"Do you smell what I smell?\" Copper asked her. \"Yeah, but I hope I'm wrong.\" Danielle said with widened eyes. They both soon heard a growling sound. \"Dare we go check it out?\" Danielle gulped. \"I'd rather not.\" Copper said. The two dogs then went to get away from the vicious growling as they feared the worst. The growling, in fact, came from a black bear who was looking for prey which was never a good sign, and where the unlucky one was Amos Slade. Danielle and Copper walked off together, but the hound dog soon stopped. \"Copper?\" Danielle asked. \"Amos...\" Copper whispered in worry for his human. \"I have to help him.\" Danielle could understand why Copper needed to save his master. \"You better go then...\" she then softly told him, not wanting to hold him back. Copper soon gave her a lick on the cheek. Danielle's eyes widened and she blushed, feeling her heart race inside her chest. Was this what her mother told her about love? \"Is this the scary part?\" Dot's voice asked. \"Yes, Dot, this is getting to the scary part.\" Patch warned. Dot soon gulped as she huddled to Scruffy. \"Aw, it'll be all right, Dottie...\" Collette said. \"Do you mind if I take a quick break from the story?\" Dot asked. \"I think I need a minute.\" \"Go ahead, sweetie.\" Patch smiled comfortingly, almost like his sister Penny's bond with their father when they were puppies. Dot soon walked away to have a moment to herself. \"It's so nice of you to comfort your sister, Scruffy.\" Patch smiled. \"Well, she's my sister, I gotta look out for her...\" Scruffy replied. \"Even though Fluffy and Spot don't live here anymore... Anyone know who adopted them?\" \"For Fluffy, I don't know, but a woman named Moonray adopted Spot for 'spiritual guidance' for her daughters,\" Collette said as the woman sounded like a hippie. \"I feel like your brother's gonna end up like Buddha from The Air Buddies.\" \"Sounds like it.\" Scruffy said. Dot sat alone as she stared out the window, looking at the world. \"I wish I could be brave like Mom, Dad, and Scruffy...\" she then sighed. \"I bet even Grandma Perdita was braver than I am... I'll never go on any real adventures with Estelle someday.\" A light seemed to shine down on Dot as she lay down. Dot sighed before staring off into space before looking into the clouds to see a pink whippet angel who had a small smile to her to help cheer her up and teach her to never give up hope. \"W-Who are you?\" she then asked. \"My name is Annabelle, my child,\" The whippet angel smiled. \"You seem like you need guidance, why would someone as happy and healthy as you need to be down in the dumps?\" Dot had a feeling she could trust her. Annabelle smiled. \"Are you an angel?\" Dot asked the whippet. \"Oh, you could say that,\" Annabelle smiled. \"Aw... You look so pretty... Just like how Gabriel made you before you were born.\" Dot smiled at that compliment. \"You'll do fine on your own adventures someday, my child,\" Annabelle smiled back. \"When your parents first watched The Air Buddies, they weren't too sure about it either, but look at where they ended up. Also, not to mention two certain wolves you may meet in the future, and I don't just mean Balto and his family.\" \"You mean Humphrey and Kate?\" Dot asked. \"Those would be the ones.\" Annabelle smiled. \"Ooh.\" Dot smiled back in excitement and anticipation. \"It'll be like your own adventure in the wild, like the first time your parents watched over The Buddies.\" Annabelle smiled back. \"Yay!\" Dot smiled. \"Well, someone suddenly likes the sound of a good adventure,\" Annabelle smiled back. \"You would make a wonderful Guardian Angel in the future.\" Dot smiled back at her. \"I best get going now,\" Annabelle told her. \"Be good, I know you will, ta-ta for now~\" \"Goodbye...\" Dot said before sighing with a small smile. \"Nothing like talk from an angel to make you feel better about yourself.\" She soon went back inside. \"Feeling better, dear?\" Collette smiled. \"I think so, Mom,\" Dot nodded. \"You can continue telling the story, Dad.\" \"Thank you, now, um, where was I?\" Patch replied. \"Uncle Copper went to save his master.\" Scruffy reminded. \"Oh, yes, that's right...\" Patch nodded, getting back into the story.[Chapter 8] Danielle shivered nervously from the growling as she feared the worst, but she hoped that Copper would be alright. \"Stay here.\" Copper told Danielle before going towards who was growling which was a black bear. \"Oh, Copper, be okay.\" Danielle begged. Copper began to growl at the black bear. Danielle may had been a rough and tough tomboy, but seeing the black bear startled her. Amos shook nervously and tried to shoot at the bear, just hitting its shoulder which made it roar even louder. The bear snarled and came closer to the hunter with beady red eyes, but with Copper helping Amos, it was challenging for the bear. Danielle covered her face with her paws, shaking slightly in fear. Amos slid down from the cliff and even got his gun trapped and his foot got caught in one of his traps as the bear came closer and closer toward him. Copper growled and soon attacked the bear despite the bear being bigger and more terrifying than him. Danielle began into pray that Copper wouldn't get hurt. She just couldn't bare to watch, no pun intended. The bear whacked Copper off. Copper was not hurt, but continued to growl at the black bear. Amos grunted and struggled as he had a hard time getting his own trap off of his foot during the fight between Copper and the bear. Patch and the others began to worry about Copper. \"I just can't look,\" Danielle whimpered. \"Tell me when it's over.\" \"You got it, Dani.\" Angel soothed. Copper and the black bear continued to fight to what looked like the death. Tod even looked worried for his best friend. The black bear soon punched Copper down which made the hound dog whimper and whine. \"Tod!\" Vixey called out. Tod was about to go with her, but seeing his best friend tore him apart on the inside. Patch and the others soon went to save Copper. \"Copper...\" Danielle whimpered. \"Be strong, Danielle, I know you can do it.\" Annette encouraged. Danielle took a deep breath before joining in to save Copper. Copper was thrown down by a rock and looked rather hurt. Danielle growled and ran toward the bear, jumping up and biting at its leg. And where this caught the bear's attention. Danielle growled as she glared up at the black bear for hurting Copper. \"Charge!\" Patch's voice called out. The bear looked over. The dogs all then charged together towards the black bear. \"We might be puppies anymore, but we should give him a dose of our own Puppy Power!\" Annette proclaimed, almost like Scrappy Doo. Tod even joined in on the fight against the bear. It was a graphic fight, and even though they were dogs, more of them did much better against the black bear than just Copper. Patch soon saw the water fall and had an idea and whispered it to Collette and told her to pass it onto the next dog. Collette passed it on until they came to the final dog as they fought the black bear, and where they fought him all the way up to a tree that was close to the edge, leading to where the waterfall was heading. The black bear snarled. Tod soon tackled him down to the edge, but he seemed to be going with the bear down the edge into the waterfall. \" TOD! \" Everyone else cried out as Tod fell with the black bear. They soon rushed down to where the waterfall ended. There was a huge splash heard. Patch and the others sat on the shore to wait for an outcome. Eventually, it was Tod who came out of the water and the black bear had been defeated. \"Oh, thank goodness.\" Collette sighed out of relief. Tod had trouble walking, but he was still alive. Nick and Judy rushed over to help him out. \"I think he broke a leg.\" Judy said to Nick and the others. \"You sure?\" Collette asked. \"I'm not positive, but there has to be some injury, he's having trouble walking.\" Judy replied. Copper and Danielle soon came together to see their fallen fox friend. There was soon the clicking of a gun heard and everyone looked up to see Amos glaring as he was about to shoot Tod dead. Patch and the others soon got in Amos's way. \"Come on, Copper, get out of the way.\" Amos told the hound dog. Copper soon stood over Tod to protect him as they were best friends. He even included a whimper as a begging to Amos to not shoot Tod. Amos glared to Tod, but didn't want to also shoot Copper, and hoped the hound dog would get out of the way, but of course, he wouldn't. His face soon softened as he found himself unable to shoot. \"Well... Come on, boy...\" he then said gently as he put his weapon down and pet his dog. \"Let's go home.\" He of course had to limp the rest of the way with what happened. Copper soon began to follow his human back home, but then stopped. Nick and Judy then helped Tod on dry land as he seemed hurt. Tod looked to them before looking at Copper and giving him a small smile. Copper smiled back to Tod before he continued on. \"I'm confused; why didn't they say goodbye?\" Danielle asked. \"Maybe it would be too sad?\" Patch guessed. Nick and Judy soon brought Tod over to where they were staying in the forest to check him over for any injuries from the black bear fight, luckily he didn't break any of his legs or body parts. \"You have a small sprain, you're very lucky.\" Judy told Tod. \"Thanks, Aunt Judy,\" Tod smiled wearily. \"I can still call you that, right?\" \"Of course you can; in fact, your uncle has something to ask you.\" Judy said. \"W-What is it, Uncle Nick?\" Tod asked. \"Well... As you know, we're planning on getting married,\" Nick smiled to his nephew. \"We were wondering if you'd like to help out in the wedding with a special job.\" \"What kind of job?\" Tod asked. \"Oh... I was thinking maybe, since you're older, you could be my best man... Er... Fox?\" Nick replied. \"Really?\" Tod smiled. \"You want me to be your best fox?\" \"I wouldn't want it any other way, kiddo.\" Nick smiled back. \"Oh, Uncle Nick, thank you,\" Tod beamed. \"I'd love to!\" This seemed to be like an ending to a new beginning. Dot and Scruffy both smiled to that. The next morning came in the forest. The dogs were fast asleep until they groaned and heard pecking from a certain woodpecker, and where they woke up, ready to stop the annoying bird. \"I'm gonna tear his feathers off,\" Patch growled. \"He's more annoying than Daffy Duck.\" \"Hey, that name sounds like Danger Duck from when Akito and Estelle met The Loonatics!\" Scruffy's voice spoke up. \"That's because Daffy was Danger Duck's ancestor.\" Patch's voice said. \"Oh... I knew that...\" Scruffy said. Dot just rolled her eyes to that. The dogs glared as they came up to the tree. \"Shh, this is it!\" Dinky told Boomer. \"We got him for sure now!\" \"Guys, I think you might be surprised by what you find.\" Patch said. \"Duh, what makes ya say that?\" Boomer asked. \"Oh, my g-gosh!\" There seemed to be magic going on inside the tree which startled the two birds. \"What happened...?\" Dinky asked. Eventually, out came a butterfly. \"You see?\" Patch told the two birds. \"He became a butterfly.\" The butterfly smiled all around before flying away from the birds who had been stalking him for a long time now. \"I wonder how Mr. Slade is doing?\" Danielle said. \"Maybe he has a change of heart?\" Collette replied. \"I doubt it... People can't change like that...\" Annette said. \"You and Scrappy turned evil that one time before you both had to be sent away,\" Patch reminded. \"By the way, where did you guys go anyway after you got in trouble?\" \"Scooby's sister sent us to stay with her other brother named Yabba Doo and Deputy Dusty in Tumbleweed County.\" Annette explained. They soon heard Amos's voice. This made them all turn over as their ears seemed to prick up. They found the man groaning and whining as Widow Tweed was bandaging him up. \"What a baby.\" Danielle scoffed. \"Will you hold still?\" Widow Tweed giggled. \"You're behaving like a child!\" \"For gosh sake's, your hurtin' my foot, woman!\" Amos complained. \"If he would hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much.\" Collette whispered to the others. \"That's always such a hard lesson for some to learn.\" Patch nodded. \"I think Chief acted like a pup while he was injured.\" Annette said. \"Huh, he's sure making a big fuss over a hurt little leg.\" Chief scoffed as he sat beside Copper in their barrels. Copper smirked and shook his head to the older dog, and looked a little sleepy. Danielle, seeing Copper sleepy, made her sleepy. \"You've had an exhausting time, why don't you go join him?\" Annette offered. Danielle seemed to already do just that. The others allowed her to go. Danielle soon got settled in to lay down next to Copper and soon fell asleep right next to him. Copper looked over to her before smiling and falling back asleep, and where it was a new beginning for them. Tod watched from a ledge before Vixey, Nick, and Judy came to join him. Vixey soon nuzzled up against Tod to comfort him since he wasn't allowed back there. Tod soon smiled to her and nuzzled her back.[Chapter 9] \"So, when's your wedding day?\" Nick asked Tod and Vixey playfully. \"What?!\" Tod and Vixey yelped. Nick chuckled innocently as the two blushed. \"Oh, don't worry, you have time to think about that.\" Judy giggled to the younger fox couple. \"By the way, Vixey, what did you mean by 'six' after counting those ducklings two days ago?\" Tod asked the vixen. \"Oh, uh, nothing too important, just counting.\" Vixey smiled sheepishly and innocently. \"Um, okay?\" Tod said out of confusion. \"You weren't planning on having six kits, were you?\" Judy asked. Vixey giggled bashfully to that. Tod seemed to blush as he had a feeling by the way of how Vixey giggled. \"Would you also like to come to the wedding?\" Judy offered to Vixey. \"Oh, I'd love to!\" Vixey smiled. \"Thank you... Um... Hmm... What should I call you?\" \"Judy's fine.\" The female bunny smiled back. \"Well then, I'd love to Judy.\" Vixey smiled. Judy smiled back as this was sure going to be a wedding to remember. \"Is Cotton gonna come too?\" Tod asked about Judy's bunny niece who was very close with her and vice versa. \"Oh, no doubt, after all, she's my favorite niece.\" Judy smiled. \"Oh, how adorable~\" Vixey cooed at the mention of Cotton. Judy and Vixey giggled together, going off to have some fun together as a girl's time. \"Girls... Am I right, Uncle Nick?\" Tod asked. \"Yep...\" Nick replied. \"They're strange creatures sometimes.\" \"Can we get to the wedding part?\" Dot's voice asked. \"Okay, okay, if you insist.\" Patch's voice chuckled. \"Ugh, this is gonna be mushy, isn't it?\" Scruffy rolled his eyes. \"I like the story of when you got to let The Air Buddies meet Krypto the Superdog during Bartleby's birthday.\" \"Oh, come along now, Scruffy...\" Collette's voice said. \"It's all love and kissy stuff...\" Scruffy groaned until he soon saw Dot giving him the puppy dog eyes look. \"Augh!\" he then groaned a lot like Donkey when Shrek wanted Puss in Boots to come on their adventure in Far, Far Away. \"So...?\" Dot smiled to her brother. \"Fine... Tell us the fox and bunny wedding...\" Scruffy gave in with a groan. \"Yay!\" Dot cheered. We are soon shown the wedding between Judy and Nick. Their parents seemed concerned, but tried to be supportive of their children, and where Nick seemed to be getting cold feet. \"Oh, Nicky, you look so grown-up~\" An older female voice cooed. \"Aw, Mom, get out of here, you can't see me like this.\" Nick chuckled while blushing to his mother. \"Uncle Nick, you okay?\" Tod asked. \"Oh, I'm fine...\" Nick smiled nervously. \"Why wouldn't I be okay?\" \"Your fur's standing on end...\" Tod pointed out. \"I think I know what's going on.\" An older male voice said. \"Let me guess, you speak from experience?\" Nick playfully smirked, it was just the kind of fox he was. \"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.\" Nick's father said. \"Do tell.\" Nick chuckled. \"Grandpa?\" Tod asked his uncle. Nick nodded. \"Grandpa!\" Tod beamed to his uncle's father. Nick's father chuckled as he ruffled the top of Tod's head. Nick's mother smiled as she then hugged Tod, they were both very happy and thrilled about being grandparents, but it was a sad tale about what became of their long-lost daughter, Tod's mother and Nick's younger sister. \"Mind if I talk with Nick alone for a moment?\" Nick's father asked his wife. \"Of course, dear...\" Nick's mother agreed before taking Tod in her arm to walk with him. \"Oh, look at how much you've grown.\" Tod smiled as he followed his grandmother away. \"Son.\" Nick's father smiled. \"Dad.\" Nick smiled back. \"You sure have a come a long way.\" Nick's father smiled. \"Aw, Dad...\" Nick smiled back, a little bashfully. \"When your mother told me you were going to marry a bunny, I thought it was a crazy story, but it's all too real...\" Nick's father smiled. \"I'm very proud to be with you here on your wedding day.\" \"Well, thanks, Dad.\" Nick smiled. \"And I know how you feel; I got cold feet on my wedding day too.\" Nick's Father said. \"Heh... Who said I was nervous?\" Nick smiled nervously. \"No one had to; I can see it all over your face.\" Nick's father chuckled to his grown son. \"Is it that obvious?\" Nick smiled nervously. \"It happens to the best of us,\" Nick's father smiled back in confidence. \"You're doing better than I did when I married your mom, though, I was so nervous I nearly got sick... But don't worry, I know you can handle this.\" Nick smiled back as he was given some fatherly advise. \"Oh, my Gawd, such a happy day~\" A certain female shrew smiled up to Judy as she was in her gown. \"I'm so glad that you could come as a bridesmaid, Fru-Fru.\" Judy smiled back down. \"I'm happy I could come too.\" Fru-Fru smiled back. Judy picked up the shrew and hugged her while Fru-Fru hugged her face. \"There's my little cop.\" Bonnie smiled. \"Oh, hi, Mom.\" Judy smiled back. \"You nervous?\" Bonnie asked her. \"A little bit...\" Judy blushed. \"I'm a little surprised though that you and Dad are all right with me marrying Nick.\" \"Well, I suppose after your move to Zootopia to become the first bunny cop; anything is possible.\" Bonnie smiled as she hugged her grown daughter. Soon enough, it was time. A bunny girl who was the niece of Judy named Cotton giggled and began to prance around while tossing flower petals. \"Not yet, dear.\" A female pig told the little bunny girl. The wedding music was soon heard. Nick soon walked down the aisle first as it was customary and he joined Tod at the side, having his nephew as Best Fox. Fru-Fru joined the other bridesmaids down the side. Eventually, everyone stood up as Stu linked arms with Judy and she wore a bridal veil over her violet eyes and they walked down the aisle together, and where Nick had literally dropped over how beautiful Judy looked. Tod's eyes widened nervously for his uncle. Nick smiled sheepishly as he soon stood back up, dusting himself off. Stu smiled as he soon let Judy go and she then walked further to Nick while holding her bouquet. They soon arrived at the end of the aisle. Nick and Judy soon faced each other and everyone then sat down. The service soon began and went as well as you'd expect, and the preacher asked if there were any objections. Fru-Fru stood up for a moment which worried everyone, but she was straightening out her dress and soon sat back down, not saying anything. This calmed everyone down, showing that their were no objections. The preacher soon asked Judy and Nick if they would take each other as husband and wife, and soon announced them as married and allowing Nick to kiss his bride. Nick lifted up the veil from Judy's face and soon kissed her on the lips. This made everybody in the church cheer and celebrate the new happily wedded couple. After that, it was of course time for cake. \"Of course a rabbit wedding would have carrot cake...\" Nick commented before he snuck a nibble and ate it, but then soon smiled as he liked it and snuck a little more. \"Nicholas Piberius Wilde, are you sneaking your cake before Judy cuts it?\" Mrs. Wilde scolded her grown son. \"No?\" Nick lied with his mouth full. \"You've always had such a sweet tooth...\" Mrs. Wilde sighed with a slight face-paw. \"At least Tod knows better... Right, Tod?\" \"You say something, Grandma?\" Tod's voice muffled as he seemed to do the same thing as Nick did. \"Never mind.\" Nick's mother sighed. Eventually Judy came to cut the cake, and saw pieces missing which made her glare at her new husband. \"He started it.\" Nick pointed to Tod. \"Did not!\" Tod glared. Judy simply sighed as she should have seen this coming. Nick and Tod both smiled sheepishly. Judy then cut the cake and made sure that everyone else got some and smiled as she did her best to cut a very tiny piece for Fru-Fru and her friend, Mariana, who was also the sister of Jerry Mouse and the mother of Tuffy. Not to mention, another slice for Vixey.[Chapter 10] \"And it was a perfectly lovely celebration...\" Patch smiled as the story was winding down, and the humans seemed to be packing for something. \"Best of all, Tod and Copper would still be best friends, but of course, as you now know him as your Uncle Copper and he and Aunt Danielle along with Uncle Tod and Aunt Vixey lived happily ever after.\" \"Aww~\" Dot smiled back once the story ended. Scruffy rolled his eyes and stuck his tongue out to the wedding part. \"I hope we can see Uncle Tod and Aunt Vixey sometime.\" Dot beamed. \"I'm sure you will...\" Patch smiled before looking to the family around them. \"Uh, what's going on?\" \"Oh, we didn't tell you guys?\" Atticus replied. \"We're going camping this weekend.\" \"Wahoo!\" Patch cheered. \"Where are we camping to?\" Collette asked. \"Jellystone Park?\" \"You're funny, but no,\" Mo chuckled. \"We're going to Jasper National Park.\" \"Yay!\" Scruffy and Dot cheered. \"Is Yogi Bear there?\" Dot wondered. \"No, he lives in Jellystone Park with Boo Boo and Ranger Smith.\" Collette giggled. \"I think you watch too many cartoons.\" Patch teased his mate. \"Oh, ha, ha, ha.\" Collette smirked. \"Aren't Yogi and Boo Boo the names of those genies from Aliyah-Din and the Magic Lamp?\" Dot wondered. Scruffy shrugged before they decided to go see everyone as they packed up for a camping trip. \"Story time again?\" Atticus asked as he pet Patch while Mo patted Collette on the head. \"Yeah.\" Patch nodded. \"Kids love 'em.\" Collette added. \"I can imagine,\" Mo smiled. \"So, you guys wanna go camping with us? You might meet someone you know... I read that dogs are descended from wolves.\" \"You mean like Humphrey and Kate?\" Patch smiled back. \"Well, you never know...\" Mo smiled back. \"We've had stranger family trees.\" \"Yeah, that's true, but camping will be good...\" Patch smiled. \"I don't think I can remember the last time we went camping.\" \"Same here.\" Collette said. \"I think my favorite time was Camp Everfree though.\" Patch smiled. \"Yeah, that was pretty fun.\" Atticus agreed. Akito and Estelle packed their bags with Scruffy and Dot joining them, and when they looked to their stuff, they found themselves seeing some books that Ace and Lexi sent them from their last visits from Acmetropolis. \"Treasure Planet...\" Akito said softly. \"Princess Power...\" Estelle added. \"You two okay?\" Scruffy asked. \"Oh... Just thinking... I can't believe how long ago that was...\" Estelle said. \"What?\" Dot asked. \"Our adventures with Ace and Lexi...\" Estelle replied. \"I thought we'd be there forever.\" Akito added. \"Same here.\" Estelle said. \"So, what're these books about?\" Dot asked, making conversation. \"I'll go first cuz ladies first,\" Estelle teased her twin brother before sitting down with Dot to show her the book. \"This is Princess Power. Kara, a modern-day princess with an everyday life. One day, after being kissed by a magical butterfly, Kara soon discovers she has amazing super powers allowing her to transform into Super Sparkle, her secret, crime-fighting alter ego who flies around the kingdom ready to save the day!\" \"She kinda looks like Barbie.\" Dot commented about the blonde girl in the picture. \"I know.\" Estelle smiled. \"What's your story?\" Scruffy asked Akito. \"It's a lot like Treasure Island, but with a sci-fi theme, it looks really cool...\" Akito smiled. \"I'd like to meet the Jim Hawkins in this story.\" \"Sounds cool.\" Scruffy smiled back. \"I sure miss Ace and Lexi a lot,\" Estelle sighed. \"I'm proud that Zadavia made them and the other Loonatics the Guardians of the Galaxy.\" \"Uh, sorry about being mean, Sis,\" Akito said sheepishly. \"It was just that Dad was gone so long...\" \"It's okay, besides, I knew you were only acting evil.\" Estelle reassured. \"You know me so well...\" Akito replied. \"I think that's a twin thing... I try to learn from James and Amber in Enchancia sometimes.\" \"Except that one time when Amber tried to get Cedric to the James a year younger only to turn him into a baby by accident.\" Estelle said. \"Oh, no!\" Scruffy and Dot gasped. \"Why did she do that?\" Dot asked. \"Oh, Amber was just a little upset about having to share her birthday.\" Estelle explained. \"And it didn't help that James had ate the first batch of pancakes on the plate that was supposed to be for both of them.\" Akito said. \"Oh, I hope James isn't mean.\" Dot pouted. \"He isn't,\" Akito promised. \"He just didn't know that the pancakes were for both of them.\" \"Well, that's good.\" Dot said. \"Can we meet them soon?\" Scruffy asked. \"I'm sure of it,\" Estelle said. \"Oh, but no chasing Clover, he's a bunny.\" \"He's not like Aunt Fluttershy's bunny, is he...?\" Dot asked since Angel was kind of spoiled sometimes. \"No, no.\" Estelle shook her head. \"Clover is very nice, and funny, and a great bunny...\" Akito smiled from memory. This made Scruffy and Dot smile back. Eventually, the car was being loaded up for the family camping trip, and where the Fudo siblings did the very best that they could with packing up. \"Kids...\" Mo chuckled. Soon enough, they were all ready. \"Is that everything?\" Atticus asked. \"I think the kids packed everything, but the kitchen sink.\" Mo smiled. \"Let's go.\" The Fudo siblings smiled back to their mother. \"All right, off we go then.\" Atticus smiled as he took the wheel to drive in the car. \"This old man, he played one~\" Mo began to sing. \"He plays knick-knack on my thumb~,\" The kids sang with their mother as they drove to Jasper National Park. \"With a knick-knack paddy wack, Give a dog a bone, This old man comes rolling home~\" They were now on their way to the park which would be another adventure. The whole family was very excited about going, but that was a story for another time. Atticus and Mo looked out the window and they could've sworn they saw an older fox couple in the forests they passed with kits of their own along with an orange creature with purple eyes that looked like a fox bunny hybrid. The End ","Summary":" \"Hey, Dad, there was something we've wanted to know.\" Scruffy said. \"What's that, kiddo?\" Patch"},{"Movie":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang","Title":"Pleasant Valley Blues","Author":"Rat-chan","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6048642","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer : Property of others blah blah blah copyright blah blah. This is a work of fiction. Any similarities to actual persons living or dead are unintentional. Overlong first chapter author's notes : This is an AU story set in an actual California prison: Pleasant Valley State Prison. I will try to keep it as real as possible, but all my knowledge is on the wrong side (three immediate family members that work/have worked in Corrections, but thankfully no family members that have done time). Sadly, most of my interpretations of prison life will be based off \"Prison Break,\" with snippets of stuff I actually know (like names of various state facilities, levels of security, a few administrative details, etc) thrown in. I may use actual events/inmates for inspiration, but all accounts will be fictional and timelines will be altered to suit my whims. This is AU - I can do that. As for the KKBB timeline and characters, I'll keep as true as possible to the original, but some things must be necessarily altered. No real warnings for Chapter 1, but later chapters will decidedly have warnings. And now, I'll get on with it! Harry's eyes, despite his attempts not to be nervous, darted here and there almost frantically as he took his first step into Pleasant Valley (never had any place been less aptly named) State Prison. If he had been expecting great relief from the blistering heat outside, he was only moderately disappointed. If he had been expecting some reassurance that his life was not going to end in this hellhole... Well, it was a good thing he was not that optimistic. OK, so it wasn't Folsom or Corcoran. And he wasn't going to be in the maximum security ward. No rubbing elbows with Charlie Manson or Sirhan Sirhan… But for someone whose fighting skills were unlikely even up to a women's facility, it was more than bad enough. First off, there were the guards. The one who had been on the bus with the new inmates and who was now leading them inside was like a cross between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Lenny from \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (or was it \"Of Mice and Men?\" Harry never could keep his boring literary movies straight), except with less intelligence than either. The brain-dead mass had been obscenely fondling his nightstick since the bus had started rolling and his expression as he had eyed the prisoners had said clearly that he lived for punishment. The guard that now received them seemed more intelligent at least, if not more compassionate. Farm boy Charles Barkley, Harry dubbed him. His cold eyes and stony demeanor promised swift and merciless response to any trouble. Again Harry found his eyes wandering here and there around the room, looking for signs of his fellow inmates (other than the subdued and motion sick lot that had been on the bus with him). After two months at the Reception Center in Chino, they were his greatest anxiety. It had taken Harry most of his stay at that overcrowded facility to learn half the inmate politics. And now he had a whole new prison to learn. All new rules of who to avoid, who to play nice with, and whose ass to kiss and how to kiss it... \"Lockhart!\" the deep voice of the Pleasant Valley guard called him forward. The underlying anger in that authoritative voice had Harry scrambling forward before he remembered he was supposed to avoid showing fear at all costs. \"Don't look scared, whatever you do, boy,\" an older inmate at Chino had told Harry when he had learned it was the younger man's first time doing hard time . \"Guards, inmates. They all trip on the power play - it's the drug of choice inside.\" Harry recovered himself enough to walk fully upright, but with eyes down as the old man had instructed. Still, when he met the eyes of farm boy Charles Barkley ( Jones , the man's nametag proclaimed), Harry could see the hint of a smirk behind the man's otherwise grim expression. \"I'm Harry Lockhart, er, boss.\" He knew well enough by now what to call the guards, if not how to talk to them. Jones' smirk became more obvious. \"And I'm the head guard here, but you can call me 'boss' or 'the right hand of God.'\" The man did not sound like he was joking. \"Now, you follow the rules here and you'll make it through to your parole.\" \"Rules, boss?\" \"Rule one, you follow the COs' orders and you follow them quick and without question.\" \"Yes, boss.\" So far he was managing the conversation alright. \"Rule two, you make trouble, you get trouble. Tenfold. Clear?\" \"As crystal, boss.\" Jones gave him a hard look at that, but apparently decided that Harry was not being a smart ass. \"Now pick up your blues and get out of my sight.\" \"With pleasure, boss. Orange isn't my color.\" Beyond that, the orange uniform of Chino hurt Harry's eyes with its brightness. \"You getting smart with me, Lockhart?\" All trace of amusement left the guard's face. \"Uh, no sir, I mean, boss. Smart's not a word that's ever been associated with me.\" Harry swallowed and looked down as Jones continued to glower at him. \"Rule three, just for you, Lockhart: keep your mouth shut except to say 'yes, boss' and I won't have to shut it for you. Got it?\" \"Yes, boss.\" \"Now go.\" Harry scampered again to collect his prison blues and go to the other barred door to the room - the one that led deeper in. \"Rogers!\" Jones called to the guard waiting at that door. \"Take Cottontail here to C Ward. He's Gay Perry's new cellie.\" Gay Perry? Fucking Hell no! Harry's step slowed as his trepidation about his new home for the next five years overcame his eagerness to leave Jones' presence. \"Liven it up, Cottontail.\" Rogers apparently liked Harry's new nickname. And like the bus guard, he also seemed to like his nightstick an inordinate amount. \"Yes, boss,\" Harry replied in a subdued tone. Rogers guided him down a hall to another door, which led back outside. They walked across heat-shimmering asphalt, razor wire topped chain link fences on either side, toward a building with a large C on it. Level III ... Harry's nervous eyes yet again flicked here and there in spite of all his efforts. His vision was good. He could make out the rifles the guards in the towers carried. \"Don't make me ask you again, Cottontail.\" Harry's step had faltered again. \"Yes, boss.\" With a nudge of Rogers' nightstick against his back, they made their way into the large, imposing block of a building that was C Ward. The guard nodded to a fellow officer who, Harry noted with shock, actually gave him a tiny, almost friendly nod of greeting as well. A tiny glimmer of hope sparked within Harry, but it sputtered out as soon as the Latino guard opened the cell block door and the eyes of hundreds of inmates zeroed in on Harry with every variation between utter disinterest and predatory assessment. Back straight, eyes down . He kept his eyes focused on the floor a few feet in front of him, at the moment grateful for Rogers' imposing frame (man looked like an oversized cross between Chuck Norris and Burt Reynolds, complete with porn-tache) beside him. The guard's presence did not stop the catcalls of the other prisoners, though. \"Hey Fish!\" Harry was prepared for this charming nickname at least. \"You don't get along with Gay Perry, you give me a call.\" \"Must be a dog fish - look at those big puppy eyes. Hey Dogfish, I got a bone for you!\" \"Whatcha in for, Fish? Snatch the wrong granny's purse?\" \"Well, I think we've got a tropical fish here - look how red he's gone.\" To Harry's increased horror, he felt his cheeks become hotter than the nearly stifling temperature could account for. Fortunately, his cell seemed to be on the lowest level and not too far from the door. \"Van Shrike!\" Rogers called. \"New cellmate for you.\" A man both taller and broader than Harry, with bleached blond hair shifted himself off the top bunk of the cell's bed. How does he maintain the color behind bars , Harry wondered inconsequentially, thinking of all the work his kind-of girlfriend put into her hair. \"You show him around, teach him the ropes, Van Shrike. I'll be holding you equally accountable for any trouble he causes in his first week.\" Rogers somehow seemed like a playground bully in front of this Gay Perry Van Shrike ( linebacker Val Kilmer, more like it !), his voice coming out in an overly gruff bark. \"Yes, boss .\" There was no obvious sarcasm in his voice, but somehow the honorific came across as anything but. \" Free time inside until lunch, Lockhart,\" Rogers told Harry, nudging him into the cell with his nightstick. \"Welcome to Pleasant Valley, Cottontail!\" he added in a ringing voice before he left, snickering. \"What did you do?\" Harry's new cellmate asked him as he looked Harry over with nearly complete disinterest. \"Um... Armed robbery,\" Harry replied, turning to face Gay Perry with a move akin to a great nervous twitch. \"I could not possibly care less what you're in for, idiot. I'm asking what you did to piss off the guards already.\" Idiot ? Was that an improvement over Fish? \"What do you mean? Was he angry?\" \"He called you Cottontail for all the ward population to hear.\" Harry blinked at him. \" Hello !\" The larger man snapped his fingers at Harry. \"It's a rabbit - a prey species? A creature only found here in the jaws of feral cats or pancaked on the tires of the bus? So what did you do?\" \"I, uh, guess I opened my mouth.\" \"You make a habit of that?\" Harry nodded. \"Well break it.\" With that, Perry Van Shrike resumed his place on the top bunk and picked up the book he had been interrupted reading. A biography of Cagney? What kind of criminal is he? \"So,\" Harry began hesitantly, at more than a bit of a loss, \"You're G- er, Perry Van Shrike? I'm Harry Lockhart.\" \"Go ahead and call me Gay Perry.\" \"Uuhh... Why the nickname?\" \"I've got a hot wife who screams down the entire cell block when she comes for conjugals. The guards and inmates are all afire with jealousy.\" \"Seriously?\" \"No, shitwit. It's exactly what it sounds like.\" \"Uh...\" Harry felt nervous sweat break out on his forehead. \"Relax, Chief. Even in prison, I've got standards.\" \"Um, I'll just call you Perry, if that's alright. Er, nice to meet you, Perry.\" \"Thrilled.\" Never had word and tone been so at odds. \"Sooo, what are you in for?\" \"Rule one: we don't have that fucking conversation.\" \"Right... Gotcha... Um… Do the bulls treat us alright in here?\" \"Rule two: no prison lingo in this cell.\" Harry felt the nervous sweat return. How am I going to live five years with this? Heat and anxiety were making him dizzy. He sat down on the lower bunk. \"Is it always this hot in here?\" \"Eight months out of the year. Be glad the guards can't handle the heat, or the thermostat wouldn't even be set as low as 80.\" Great . \"Well,\" Harry made a sickly attempt at laughter before continuing, \"I'm sure the insulation is asbestos they can get.\" \"Harry?\" \"Yes?\" Harry heard Perry shifting overhead and looked up to meet a pair of very dangerous eyes. \"Rules three through ten: shut up .\" Harry, feeling any remaining flush drain away from his face, silently nodded then lay down on his bunk. He heard a groan and muttering from above. \" God . Jones is punishing me for something!\"[Chapter 2] OK, quick word before chapter 2: I was complimented on the AU idea here, but I can't take credit. The idea is from a story prompt on the KKBB kinkmeme (which has plenty of non-kinky prompts). My idea for an AU was Wild West action and that's being written by another wonderful writer on Livejournal. Feel free to PM me for the link. Oh, and for reference: Pleasant Valley State Prison (PVSP) is in Coalinga, CA, which is more famous as the home of Harris Ranch (cattle ranch with somewhat famous beef and a great restaurant... as well as the most unpleasant smell along I5). Perry's eyes again went to his new cellmate, who sat across the none-too-clean table from him, shoveling his \"food\" as if it did not taste like something that had already been digested once. Harry's eyes, in turn, were focused on his plate. It was the most relaxed the smaller man had been since his unwelcome arrival in Perry's cell. Armed robbery ? That was apparently what this man was in for. With what? A starter pistol? He just did not seem the type. Not that Perry particularly cared. He had meant what he said in his cell: he hated hearing 25 to life stories. Figuring people out on his own terms was different, though. That was entertainment and mental stimulation - two things in short supply in prison - in one. Unfortunately, there did not seem to be much to this Harry Lockhart... except noise. \"Harry,\" Perry snapped. The other man, thus addressed, popped his head up and regarded Perry with wide eyes. Cottontail, indeed . The former detective swore he could see Harry's nose twitching minutely. \"This is Pleasant Valley State Prison, not Harris Ranch.\" Confusion temporarily replaced nervousness in Harry's eyes. \"Eh?\" Such sparkling conversation was Perry had to look forward to for the indefinite future. \"I'm trying to say that this isn't a cattle ranch. Kindly chew with your mouth closed.\" \"Sure thing, Mom. You want my elbows off the table, too?\" Perry blinked. Wit? And was it spine or stupidity that made the man speak when he was clearly as intimidated by his cellmate as Perry had intended him to be? Not promising at all if Perry was expected to keep the fool out of trouble for a while. \"Just keep it quiet,\" was all he said, though he threw in a sharp glare for good measure. Harry did not respond, lowering his gaze to his plate once more, though his appetite had apparently left him. After a moment of silence, however, followed by a nervous cough or two, he attempted to continue the conversation. \"So, um, what is Harris Ranch?\" Rules three through ten need some reinforcement . He began to sharpen his gaze once more, but then Harry raised his brown eyes to meet Perry's and against his will Perry felt his expression marginally soften. Is that hope? He was surprised he could still recognize the emotion. But there it was, shining out of Harry's eyes like the first early morning rays of the Southern California sun over the Hollywood Hills. Shaking off his poetic fancy, Perry decided to answer. \"Like I said: Harris Ranch is a cattle ranch. It's Coalinga's other claim to fame.\" \"Coalinga?\" \"It's the hellhole town in which this pesthole stands, idiot.\" This moron doesn't even know where he is? Perry's odds on Harry's survival, which had started low, continued dropping. \"That's a lot of holes.\" Perry blinked again. \"Anyway, let's just say if you're grateful for anything here, it'll be for any day the wind doesn't blow from the north.\" \"Thanks for the heads up, but I'm from Indiana. Putting up with animals' shit is a cakewalk compared to people's.\" \"What's a Midwest farmboy doing in a California penitentiary?\" The question was out of his mouth before he could get his barriers back in place. He had been momentarily disarmed by the genuine sparkle in Harry's eyes. \"Five to ten for armed robbery.\" \" Rules , Harry,\" Perry reminded him, trying to regain his footing in this conversation. \"Well you asked.\" \"Yeah. We all do things we regret.\" \"Like landing ourselves in prison?\" \"Sometimes it's something as insignificant as opening our mouths.\" \"Why do I get the feeling that has another meaning for you?\" Well Christ on a fucking Ferris wheel, this monkey can talk . Banter was a pleasure Perry had not had in months. My face feels odd , he thought and he realized that his semi-permanent frown had slipped. \"Why did you do that?\" Harry asked, his mouth matching Perry's in its downward curve. \"Do what?\" \"Close off like that. I thought we were making friends.\" \" Friends ?\" Perry snorted dramatically. \"This is prison, Lockhart, not grammar school. Look around. Do you see anyone bothering us in this particular corner of Hell?\" Harry shook his head. \"With good reason. You attract more flies with honey than with vinegar.\" \"I never really understood that saying, but I thought that was supposed to be a good thing?\" \"Not in here, it isn't. Now clean up the table.\" It came out even more sharply than Perry had meant it to, his irritation with himself multiplying his frustration with his new burden. \"Hop to, Cottontail. I'm expected to show you around until afternoon yard time.\" Harry sullenly picked up their trays, took them to the window, and followed Perry through their ward. The eyes of many of their fellow inmates moved with Harry as they went, assessing his potential for threat, use, and abuse. Nonexistent, minimal, and staggering . Perry was sure they were all coming to the same conclusions. Not my problem for long , Perry thought, shrugging internally as he showed Harry the rec room. Then, they moved onto the phones and the library. Perry explained everything as concisely as possible and did not invite questions. Harry was, thankfully, mostly silent as he struggled to assimilate all the information. His eyes would dart here and there, trying to gauge everything and everyone about them - until he would meet the eyes of a guard. Then he would twitch and nod and quickly focus on his reluctant guide once more. \"Of course, this is all assuming you are, in fact, literate...\" Perry finished his description of the library's lending system with this insulting suggestion. \"Of course I can read!\" Harry's mouth kept moving for a moment after he finished his indignant reply, as if he wanted to add an insulting epithet, but did not quite dare just now. \"Pretending to read the interviews in Playboy hardly counts.\" \"I once read one book in a single day!\" \"Wow, a whole book? Did it have nice little pictures?\" \"No. Fuck off,\" Harry snapped at him. \"The only fucking picture was on the cover.\" \"I wish I could.\" With an exasperated sigh, Perry led the way to various places Harry might go once he started any work ( He doesn't look good for much. ), support groups ( Sadly, there isn't a group for the Terminally Stupid .), or studies ( From the way he's looking right now, they might have to start from the elementary level .). \"Harry, stop that.\" The other man had been shuffling his feet and nearly pouting since that last dig. \"Stop what?\" \"Looking so cute. It's not a good look in prison.\" \" Cute ?\" Harry's face scrunched up as if he had just tasted something foul and he took a step away. Fuck , Perry had meant to say \"childish.\" \"Relax, Chief. I don't do cute. Or stupid.\" Harry's limbs relaxed, but his face did not. \"Now let's keep moving. It's afternoon yard time.\" \"In this heat?\" There were so many sarcastic replies Perry could make to that, but he had had enough of idiotic responses for the afternoon. \"Yeah. Now move.\" Harry obediently tailed him through barred doors and to the exit to the yard. He stopped in the doorway and surveyed the lay of the land, as it were. Perry's gaze followed his. The asphalt of the basketball courts shimmered in the heat and all the grass was brown and trampled down. An easterly wind blew lightly across the yard, but it was hot and dry and smelled of heated earth. Every patch of shade was fully occupied and many prisoners moved about sluggishly in full sun. It was not an inviting sight. \"The hawks aren't circling, Cottontail, so hop on out,\" Perry commanded. Harry faced him directly. \"Are you going to be calling me that, too?\" His tone was as childish as his body language had been earlier. \"Would you prefer I call you fuckhead or moron?\" \"I might. Actually, I kind of liked 'shitwit.'\" \"Whatever. Just get out there and leave me in peace for a while.\" \"What?\" \"Go, vanish. Go 'make friends.'\" With that, Perry strode away from him and toward a small table where an older inmate awaited him with a chess board. Perry half expected Harry to follow despite his orders, but something or someone had apparently caught his eye. With a shrug, Perry greeted his opponent and sat down to play. He had not made his first move, when a commotion started behind him. He kept his eyes on the game, but his ears attuned to catch any orders the guards might make. \"Van Shrike,\" his opponent interrupted him, \"I think you'd better do something...?\" The older man's intonation rose at the end of his statement and he pointed a weathered finger toward the source of the ruckus. \"Jesus fucking Christ,\" Perry groaned. Not here 24 hours ... There was a circle of inmates thronged around a pair of combatants (though how well the word applied in such an uneven match was debatable). A tall dark-haired inmate was repeatedly kicking the prone form of another. Of course, it would be Harry .[Chapter 3] \"Yeah! Kick him again, Will!\" It was remarkable, really, how much the prison yard was like the schoolyard. Harry could almost imagine that he was back at Embry Unified High School and that it was Chad Thompson, the quarterback, beating on him with the rest of the football team egging him on. He half expected to hear Harmony, head cheerleader and girl of his dreams, calling out to Chad to stop being a dick. \"Shit! Not the face, Will!\" A deep half jeering voice called out as one kick grazed his cheek, painfully splitting the skin open and almost ripping an ear. \"Cottontail won't be so cute missing half a fucking ear!\" So much for fantasies. He shuddered at the reminder of a threat he had never faced in school. More than ever, he wished that he had learned how to fight. Or, better yet, learn to keep your mouth shut, idiot! While he had acquired the skill of keeping his head down most of the time (and of protecting his vital organs when that was not enough), he had never quite gotten the hang of the whole keeping quiet thing. \"Honestly, Harry,\"Harmony had chided him once as she helped him wrap a sprained wrist. \"Sometimes I think your mouth is completely disconnected from your brain.\" She might be right, he thought as another bruising kick hit the arm that was protecting his gut. Prison was no place to be mouthing off – not when he had no friends to help him. \"Hey, Barker!\" a more familiar voice called out, though it was still new enough to Harry that he needed a moment to recognize his cellmate. \"I see you've graduated from thrashing stray dogs in the park to beating up the mentally handicapped. I suppose congratulations are in order.\" \"Fuck off, fairy! This is none of your business.\" Harry's assailant gave him one last kick before he turned to face Perry. Harry chanced a look up at the man (Barker, apparently). His demeanor had changed and once again Harry was reminded of high school and those times when his best friend Chook, who had been captain of the wrestling team, had stood up for him. The bullies had always taken that same nervously defensive stance, with frightened eyes in a belligerent face. \"The COs made it my business.\" Perry's tone fully communicated his disgust. \"I'm this fuckhead's Cliff's Notes to 'The Guide to Surviving Incarceration'. You know, 'Prison Life: For Dummies.'\" Well somebody skipped the chapter on not acting gay. If Perry showed any more regal disdain (Harry had not understood what expression those words referred to until now), a scented hanky was going to magically appear under his nose. \"Yeah? Well this fish is a slow learner. You should thank me for giving him the crash course.\" Barker hawked exaggeratedly and spat on the dusty ground a couple inches from Harry's head. \"Punk needs to learn not to stick his fucking, twitchy little nose in where it doesn't belong.\" \"I'll give him a refresher course later. In the meantime, I believe class is dismissed.\" The two men stared at each other for a long moment. What is this? Showdown at the Oh, Gay Corral? The Good, the Bad, and the Fabulous? Well, the other inmate who was grabbing Barker's shoulder looked a bit like a flower power Clint Eastwood… With a toss of his head to either side, cracking his neck, Barker said, \"This little cunt ain't worth my time. Neither of them.\" He waved his hand at the boy who was still standing behind Harry, trying not to cower against the fence. Perry glanced at the youth, looking a bit confused, before looking down at Harry. \"Ten minutes – no five minutes. You couldn't keep yourself out of trouble for that long?\" His frown was terrifying, but he held out a hand to Harry and his eyes flicked over his cellmate's injuries as he helped him up. \"Hey, you can't really blame me for this!' \"You have 30 seconds to thrill me with your brilliant excuses.\" \"I didn't...\" That was no good – he never intended to get into trouble. It found him – no, it actively sought him out. Like the trouble that had landed him in prison. \"20.\" \"It wasn't…\" OK, that was not going to work either. It was his fault for opening his mouth, but… \"10 seconds left, genius.\" \"I had to do something . You should have heard the nasty shit they were saying to this kid here.\" The \"kid\" thus indicated by Harry's words and a quick jerk of his head stiffened then. \"I'm 23. I'm not a kid.\" His attempts to look tough were seriously undermined by his soft, effeminate features and tiny frame. \"I can take care of myself a lot better than you could, Fish.\" His brown eyes glared at Harry, but he still had the aura of a stray cat backed into a corner. \"Fish? You were on the bus with me!\" Harry remembered that face and its full mouth. Cruel and unusual punishment to put a face like that in a prison like this. \"Well some of us were at Chino long enough to learn to mind our own fucking business.\" With that, the kid stalked away. \"Well at least he didn't call me Cottontail,\" Harry muttered as he brushed dust off his prison blues. When he finished, he looked back over at Perry, only to find the other man staring at him, an odd expression on his face. \"Harry, were you trying to protect that kid? That's…\" Perry shook his head, his apparently habitual frown returning. \"That is the stupidest fucking thing I've seen here yet.\" I can't argue with that. \"Ow,\" he complained instead, as a shift in posture caused his new bruises to ache. Perry sighed. \"Come on, Chief. Let's get you to the infirmary.\" \"Won't that get me in trouble for fighting?\" \"Oh, yeah. And the warden is going to call your mom in for a nice long chat.\" \"My mom died when I was a kid.\" \"Idiot! Did you notice any guards jumping in to save your ass? If there are no weapons and no signs of imminent death, the average CO chooses not to see anything.\" Perry grabbed his elbow and tugged him in the direction of the doors. \"So move.\" The command was sharp and Harry found his feet moving before his brain had even decided to walk. \"Ow,\" he complained again as they walked past Rogers. Rather than sympathy, it earned him an irritated glance from his cellmate and a satisfied smirk from the guard. \"Glad you liked the show, boss.\" Shit! He was supposed to be thinking before speaking. \"You volunteering for an encore, Lockhart?\" Rogers' hand had already been on his nightstick, but his grip tightened on it as he gave Harry a hard look. \"Well, magic is really more my area of performance expertmph…\" Harry was cut off – probably for the best – by Perry's hand over his mouth. \"You'll have to forgive Cottontail here, boss.\" Harry's eyes shifted to his cellmate in surprise. The man's tone was almost respectful. \"I'm sure you noticed he has shit for brains and he just had that beaten out of him.\" \"I told you to keep him out of trouble, Van Shrike.\" The aggressive grip on the nightstick was loosened. \"I will, boss. If I have to keep you on a fucking leash ,\" Perry added to Harry in a whisper. \"Move along,\" Rogers waved them away and they gratefully left him, and the blazing yard, behind for the relative cool of the ward. Perry was silent as they made their way to the infirmary, though whether he was seething, thinking, or simply did not deign to speak to Harry, he was not sure. I really don't get this guy… He was like an indy film: all snarky dialogue, obscure references, and hard-to-follow editing. Unfortunately, many of their fellow inmates that they passed on their way were far from silent. Harry was regaled with so many lewd comments and questions about the state of his \"fluffy white tail\" that after about the tenth one, they kind of all ran together and he was able to effectively block them out. \"Whoa there, Mama Bear.\" They were hailed by a completely different tone of voice and Harry looked up to see who had spoken. To his shock, it was the friendly guard from the ward entrance. \"What happened to the cub?\" \"Morales,\" Perry greeted the CO with a humorless smile. \"The stupid thing picked a fight with a wild boar.\" Wait a damn minute! Is he making conversation ? With a guard ! Harry was not sure which of them he should regard as if they had grown a second head. \"Well, go on in,\" this Morales urged them, pointing to the doors that apparently led to the infirmary, \"but I doubt you'll get much help. Dexter's monopolizing the medical staff again with his spleen complaint.\" \"Spleen complaint?\" Harry could not help but ask – he had never been exactly sure what the spleen did. \"Yeah. He suffers from a terrible excess of it.\" The guard chuckled slightly and Perry – Harry almost fell over at the sight of it – laughed with him, without the least mockery in his voice. \"Give my regards to Albert,\" Perry said as he opened the doors. The Morales nodded his assent. Dazedly, Harry followed his still smiling cellmate into the infirmary. \"Fight?\" was all the doctor who received them asked. When Perry nodded, the other man jerked his head toward a side counter. \"Alcohol and cotton swabs over there.\" And with that he left them. I'll never complain about New York doctors' bedside manners again. \"Sit,\" Perry commanded when they reached the counter and again Harry found himself unconsciously obeying. He watched from his perch on a stool as the blond man took out a swab and saturated its tip with rubbing alcohol. \"Turn.\" Harry prepared himself for pain as Perry began to tend the cut on his cheek, but the other man was surprisingly gentle. The deft touch of the swab brought Harmony to his mind again. One of the last free moments he had spent with her, she had taken care of a cut on his finger caused by his careless wielding of the kitchen knife. \"You're hopeless, Harry,\" she had said, but her smile was so warm, and the kiss she had given him so sweet that Harry had thought \"hopeless\" was a fucking fantastic thing to be. \"So,\" Harry said abruptly, desperate to derail his current train of thoughts before it reached its misty eyed destination, \"who's Albert?\" \"He's a man,\" Perry replied shortly as he dampened the other end of the cotton swab. \"And here I thought you were sending your regards to a cow. Ow,\" Harry said yet again as Perry continued his ministrations more vigorously. \"Fine then. How do you know porn star Benjamin Bratt back there?\" \"Porn star Benjamin Bratt? Oh god, you mean Tony?\" Perry burst out in a full-bellied laugh, drawing the attention of most of the infirmary's occupants. \"Oh, that's perfect . I told him that mustache was an abomination, but he insisted it made him look tough.\" He continued to chuckle for a moment then continued, \"Morales is—\" \"Oh, ouch,\" a slick voice interrupted them, much to Harry's disappointment. He was fucking finally talking to me like an adult! \"Have you already run afoul of Gay Perry's temper, Cottontail.\" Jesus fucking Christ. There was another one. Still, Harry turned to greet the relatively friendly inmate with a flippant response. And froze. Holy shit. Harlan Dexter. \"Well, Dexter, my respect for you has just gone up,\" Perry said to the well-groomed older man who now stood in front of Harry, frankly appraising the dark-haired man while Harry could only stare back at him. He had only seen the man in photos and on TV. \"You've somehow achieved the impossible and shut him up.\" \"A chatterbox then?\" Dexter asked with an oily smile, his gaze never leaving Harry, who shifted uncomfortably on his stool and lowered his own gaze. The bastard was every bit as sleazy as Harmony had described him. \"With both feet in his mouth and his head up his ass!\" Dexter loosed a small, slimy chuckle. \"Well, perhaps I'll get better acquainted with your flexible cellmate when he's feeling better.\" With another laugh, he finally walked away. \"Well Harry, I guess you're honored. That was—\" \" Harlan Dexter ,\" Harry breathed, looking up again. Harmony's utter hatred of the man would not allow Harry to ever forget him. \"Yes. Wait! How in hell do you know who Dexter is? You don't even know what damned county we're in here.\" \"He's goddamned Harlan fucking Dexter!\" \"I know that, moron! In case it's escaped your notice, I'm asking how you know!\" \"He killed Jenna.\" \"He what?\" \"That son of a bitch killed my girlfriend's sister!\"[Chapter 4] \"That son of a bitch killed my girlfriend's sister!\" It took an unusually long time for the meaning of those words to penetrate Perry's brain. Forrest Gump here has got himself a Jenny! Was his first inconsequential thought before full comprehension – and a sinking feeling – came to him. \"Hold up there, Chief.\" Perry held up a hand, still holding a cotton swab. \"Dexter's in here for multiple counts of rape – not murder.\" \"Jenna may have been holding the gun,\" Harry replied, rage coiled around every word, \"But that bastard as good as pulled the trigger.\" He was looking straight ahead, unfocused fire in his narrowed eyes, mouth set in an uncompromising line. It was the first time since his arrival that he looked like someone who could survive prison. But wait . \"Jenna…?\" The name rang a bell… Shit . \"Jenna Lane?\" Harry nodded, glaring at the door through which Dexter had departed. \"The one whose sister's testimony landed Dexter here rather than in the California Men's Colony?\" There was another jerky nod. \"And that sister is your girlfriend?\" \"Yes… at least, I think so… at the moment.\" Harry finally turned away from the door, confusion replacing some of the anger on his face. He looked up at Perry then, forestalling the scathing comment the larger man had been about to make. \"Small fucking world, isn't it?\" Yes , Perry though, unable to break away from the raw, compelling emotions whirl pooling in Harry's deep brown eyes. A small fucking world held together by too many cruel ironies . \"You and Dexter seemed pretty friendly…\" Harry's gaze now held a hint of accusation. \"Yeah. He enjoys the cruel ironies.\" Perry's obscure response was met with a questioning frown, but he chose not to enlighten his companion. His past with Harlan Dexter was none of Harry's business. \"Oh, sure,\" he said more firmly, \"he's Uncle Walt on the surface. It's usually too late that people find out he's Eisner. With a bunch of heavies for Mousketeers.\" \"I thought he was more of a beach blanket Katzenberg.\" Harry looked up at him now with a hint of a twinkle in his eyes and a humorous twist to his mouth. Perry found himself momentarily gaping, mouth open to laugh, but sound caught in his throat. This , he realized. This was how the man was supposed to look. \"Tha—that's not even close, goofball.\" Goofball ? Perry winced inwardly as Harry raised an eyebrow. Even he knows that was weak . \"Too blond and sleazy to be Katzenberg.\" \"How long have you been in here? Have you seen Katzenberg lately?\" \"Some people have better things to do with their time than watching all the DVD extras for chidlren's movies.\" \"Well what did you do that was so damned important?\" \"I was a-\" Damn ! How did the little moron do it? Perry's defenses were the walls of Troy – only he was not stupid enough to take in a fuck-off huge wooden horse. I guess a wooden ass is another matter … \"I was a private investigator.\" Screw it. Perhaps answering a question or two, especially ones that made Perry sound more impressive, would shut Harry up for a while. Especially if his silent, wide-eyed response to that was anything to go by. Wrong . \"A P.I.? You mean, like Jonny Gossamer?\" Harry leaned forward on his stool, only to wince as the move no doubt caused his bruised ribs to shift. \"Jonny Gossamer? Please. Now, lift up your shirt.\" Harry looked at him suspiciously, lower lip between his teeth. \"Fuckhead, I am not going to rape you in the infirmary. I just want to check your ribs.\" With a wide shrug, which caused another wince of pain, and a careless wave of the hand, the other man complied. \"Anyway, Gossamer is for children.\" \"I read it in junior high,\" Harry said defensively as Perry began checking his ribcage. \"I was never sure how he figured everything out. It was all so unconnected at first. He'd have these two cases that you thought were completely different and then it would turn out that they weren't. And-\" \"Harry!\" It took Perry a moment to remember to shut his cellmate up. I would never have supposed he would be so toned under his prison blues … No. He pushed on a bruise harder than was necessary, earning another wince… and probably a dirty look as well. \"I'm sure the Hardy Boys stump you every time, genius. Come on! Even the guy who wrote Jonny Gossamer said he was a joke.\" \"Shut up. He was just a writer – what did he know?\" \"More than you. But then again, so does the average fifth grader.\" Perry ignored the indignant sound his \"patient\" made at that. \"Phillip Marlowe: that's a detective.\" \"Was he the one Cagney played?\" \"It was Bogart, idiot.\" The happy thought of Bogey was enough to keep Perry from tearing into Harry too much over the mistake. \"Humphrey Bogart…\" His voice dropped to a near whisper and his eyes drifted from his cellmate's bruised torso to stare, unfocused, at the counter behind him. \"Right…\" Perry looked back at Harry to see the man lowering his shirt, an odd look – as if he had just tasted something sour – on his face. \"Um… so… women want him, men want to be him, and you want both… kind of thing?\" \"Something like that…\" He's taking my sexuality in stride… relatively . It was certainly not the kind of reaction Perry expected – or was used to on the inside. \"Anyway, before you led us 100 miles away from the point of the conversation, I was going to tell you to keep your mouth shut.\" \"You mean the first ten times you said it didn't count?\" \"I meant about your 'maybe girlfriend.'\" \"Did you really just speak 'in quotes?'\" Harry mimicked Perry's gesture, his moves exaggerated. \"Shut up,\" Perry responded, lowering the other man's hands and wondering if those two words were rapidly losing their meaning. \"I'm trying to warn you here: don't let Dexter know you have any connection to Harmony Faith Lane. He'll use it against both of you.\" \"OK.\" Harry's voice and expression were serious again. \"Thank you,\" he added with a small tilt of his head. \"You—you're…\" Fuck. Get it together Van Shrike ! \"Your shit, unfortunately, lands in my front yard. I'd prefer to keep it clean. Now,\" he added, rising from his seat in front of Harry, \"let's get out of here.\" Perry hated the smell of hospitals, doctor's offices and the like. It had too many unpleasant associations. \"Lockhart! Van Shrike!\" A voice called, thankfully interrupting them. They both looked over to see Morales standing there with a doctor and an injured con standing behind him. The Latino was posed aggressively, but Perry could see the smile hovering around the edges of his tough guard face. \"Time to get your asses out of here and back to your cell.\" \"Yes, boss,\" they replied in unison before following Morales out the infirmary doors. \"Y'all come back now, ya hear?\" The guard said cheerfully in a terribly facsimile of a Southern accent once they were out of the room – and earshot. \"Are you asking us to injure ourselves!\" Harry turned back and blurted out. Then, he covered his mouth with both his hands, looking fearful. \"No, of course not,\" Morales answered amiably. \"Come back with anything. A hang nail even. Those doctors need something to do besides sit on their thumbs for State money.\" Perry chuckled at that. \"Furlough days again?\" The guard uttered a string of curses in Spanish before answering. \"We're stretched thin, getting almost no time for breaks – and God am I glad I quit smoking! – because we have to take so many fucking days off, while they sit there in their little white room, sipping Maxwell House and chatting away like a pair of beauty school dropouts.\" \"What does that mean?\" Harry asked looking between the two of them, utterly bemused. \"I'll tell you when you're older,\" Perry replied brusquely, making a shooing gesture with his hand. \"Now move on. I'll be with you in a moment to make sure you haven't tripped over your own feet.\" \"Hey!\" \"Go.\" Perry watched him move away, then turned back to Morales, who was smiling at him. \"What?\" \"Oh, nothing. Just nice to see you getting along so well with your new cellie.\" \"First, cut the prison lingo – you know I hate it. Second, did you drive past a burning pot farm on your way to work today?\" \"Oh, but you two looked so cozy back there in the infirmary.\" The smile was a full blown smirk now. \"Cozy!\" Perry took a deep breath to prepare for a stream of invective, but then paused, lines from Shakespeare running through his head. Protesting would only make it worse. \"Well, he said you looked like 'porn star Benjamin Bratt,' so I decided he couldn't be a total loss.\" It was Perry's turn to smirk as Morales raised a hand to his mustache, face shifting into a mock-wounded frown. It did not last long, though, as Perry remembered the rest of their conversation. \"Seriously though, Tony.\" He dropped his voice down, leaning closer to his one time friend. \"Keep an eye out.\" \"On him or for him?\" \"Just – pay attention.\" The unease he had felt since Harry had first uttered Harlan Dexter's name had never really left him. \"It's sweet to see you so concerned about your new friend. My brother will be so pleased you found somebody at last!\" Morales' words were light, but there was a wrinkle between his brows. \"Oh please!\" Perry said, shaking his head both to reject the guard's ridiculous statement and to snap himself out of… whatever it was that had come over him today. \"I'm a P.I., not a federal marshal.\" He turned then, starting to walk away. \"What the hell does that mean?\" Morales asked, confused. \"It means I don't do the Witless Protection Program!\" With that, Perry lifted his chin and strode briskly after his cellmate.

I've began to re write this fanfictioin, in the hopes of gaining more vocabulary and editorial skills. All Characters are copyright of Disney. This story is set a few months after the ending of the original.) \"Time forges a path through life, yet we often mistake life and death. The two play hand in hand, for without life, there can be no death and without death, no new life can be born.\" Author unknown It was a bitterly cold night outside and a young fox was lying comfortably in his basket. The farm he made his home in, was a sweet old lady's. She had found this fox shortly after a pair of birds stole her laundry of the line. After a while though, the fox became a trouble maker, by befriending a hound dog. He had been warned about how his friend's adopted father and owner, but he insisted that his friend would be different. The old lady, Widow Tweed, had adopted her fox, Tod and his mate, Vixey, back into her house as she didn't enjoy being alone. Since Vixey had been brought up in the wild, She would often leave for a fortnight, trying to break free from the cold feeling of the four walls. She had decided to take the trip a few days ago, allowing her mate complete freedom of his time. As he began slipping deeper into his sleep, Tod's vision became a bright wall of white, allowing nothing to be seen through his blinded eyes for a few moments. Now, unaware of his surroundings, the stunned and disorientated fox quickly finds his feet and waist no time in his search for help is hit by a white flash that leaves him disorientated. He instantly stands and began scurrying around the house. After a few moments searching at high speed, exhaustion begins to take a hold of the fox. He eventually found Widow Tweed in her room, sitting in her rocking chair, reading her book. Her reading was suddenly put on hold when a thump from the far side of the room managed to steal her attention. She lowered her book to find Tod shaking, desperately looking around for any sign of his owner. His body bruised from the multiple hits to the wall as he blindly ran around the familiar smelling room. \"Tod?\" Widow asked as she was curious as to why her fox was acting so. The panting fox screeched to a hold, hearing the sweet sound of his saviour. After figuring out where she was, Tod decided to get to her as soon as possible, so he dashed off to get to her. However, after managing just three paces, His hind legs became numb and feeling less, causing the fox to slip hard on the wooden floor. Sliding across the gap to Widow Tweeds feet, the fox soon reached the old lady, but remained motionless after hitting her feet. Widow looked at her fox laying at her feet. Unsure of what to do, she tried yelling his name, \"Tod, get up,\" but got nothing in response. Panic started to set in as she realised he was not getting up. After an intense few seconds of debating on what to do, she came to the conclusion that she had one option. Standing up as quick as her legs would allow, she picked up Tod's lifeless body and carried him to the car, where she lay him down on the passenger seat. After wrapping him in a warm blanket, she started her car and sped down the bumpy road into town, not caring to fix the flat tire. The one place that could help was just on the outskirts of town. The veterinary. (Authors Note: Sorry about the changes, but I feel that this story needed a face lift now that my editorial skills have been put to the test.

I will try and update this as soon as possible.) \"Life is a near-death experience.\" George Carlin Upon arrival, Widow Tweed turned her car off and ran inside in search of Tod's usual veterinarian, Dr Mulligan. Once she had found him, he ran outside without hesitation, grabbed the limp fox from the car, and dashed inside with Widow Tweed watching in horror from the entrance. Dr Mulligan rushed Tod inside, holding him fast in his arms. \"Move! Out the way! We have a collapsed fox here!\" he shouted in an effort to disperse the crowd and make a path through to the emergency room where Widow Tweed was asked to wait outside. Widow Tweed couldn't stand the thought of losing her best friend. She knew Tod was in the best hands and so, she left them to it. She sat down on the chair in the waiting room and bawled her eyes out. It took a painstaking two hours before they were complete. By the time the veterinarians had finished, Widow Tweed's crying had stopped and anxiety had set in. She heard the door of the emergency room open. She stood up, faced the swaying door, and began to worry when she saw Dr Mulligan step out and face her, meeting her concerned eyes. He could see that she was uneasily watching the door, expecting Tod to walk out. He closed the door behind him and walked over to Widow. \"Doctor, how is he? Is he alive? What's happening?\" she said, starting to sob a little. Dr Mulligan sighed and, after taking a deep breath, he asked, \"Do you want the good news first or the bad news?\" By now, she had started tearing again and it became difficult for her to form sentences. Her dry lips tried to form a word, but her voice started to crack. \"Good\" was her only response. \"Well, Tod is alive and breathing. He has not yet woken up, but his vital signs are good,\" says Dr Mulligan. Widow Tweed felt her heart lighten up. Then, without warning, her curios side started catching up to her and caused her to ask, \"And the bad news?\" Dr Mulligan felt his hands get sweatier and his saliva start drying up. He knew all too well that Widow Tweed loved her fox with all her heart and she had given up a lot for him. He replied soon after, \"Tod has suffered a major stroke due to a blood clot lodged in his brain. He will unavoidably have little to no feeling in his hind legs.\" Widow Tweed was shaken up and a gasp slipped out her mouth upon hearing this news. Although death was her biggest worry for the fox, this somehow seemed worse. Widow Tweed turned to look through the glass doors of the room Tod had been examined. She took a long look at the half-unconscious and barely alive fox lying there, on the table, in an awkward position. Dr Mulligan had to pull her attention back to him and so he said,\" We will have to keep him the night, just to make sure that he adapts without injuring himself.\" Widow Tweed looked the veterinarian straight in the eye. She was not very happy about the idea of leaving her fox out of her sight while he was in pain. She sternly said, \"I will not let that happen. Unless I stay here as well.\" She then turned around and found a chair and sat down, saying,\" You had better inform me if anything changes.\" She soon after fell asleep. Widow Tweed slept for a few hours and had started to wonder how Tod was doing. As she stood up and walked to the emergency room, she could not see Dr Mulligan or Tod. Her heart started racing as she worried over what was happening. She ran to the reception desk to ask where the two were and was told that they were in the back room. She had now become unhappy and stormed to the back room. As she arrived, she noticed a sign that said, \"Recovery in Progress.\" She stared blankly at the sign and opened the door regardless. Widow Tweed slowly and quietly opened the door, looked around, and found Dr Mulligan and Tod on the far side of the room trying to get Tod back on his feet. Once on his feet, he felt the veterinarian take a hold of his sides gently and walked with him slowly to see if his legs were helping. He looked across the room and saw Widow Tweed standing half in the doorway. He then motioned her to come in. Her face lit up when with a smile and a tear when Dr Mulligan let go of the fox's sides and watched Tod walk by himself. She could tell he was concentrating hard and tried to reach him without him hearing. Her footsteps were louder then she had anticipated and turned her fox's attention to her, causing him to lose his focus and slip to the ground. Dr Mulligan and Widow Tweed set their attention on the fox and he managed to get up onto all four of his legs without help. Tod then began to walk to Widow as she sunk her body lower to the ground as if to erg him on. Once he had reached her, she folded her arms around him quickly and gave him a gentle but comforting squeeze. Tears of happiness formed the both of their eyes as their hearts filled with joy. Widow then got up with Tod still in her arms and said, \"He is coming home with me\" and with that thanked the veterinarian and left for the door. However, before she could leave the building, a hand firmly grasped her shoulder. She turned around to find Dr Mulligan staring at her with a serious face. \"There is something you need to know, even though you won't like it,\" he said with a sigh between sentences. \"I am sorry but there is no other way to put this but, Tod has just under a month to live. I'm truly sorry,\" he said as he turned around and walked back to the emergency room. Widow Tweed looked at the uneasy fox and realised for the first time how in pain and tired Tod was. She would not let this thought ruin her moment and so she left for the car, laid Tod gently in the passenger seat, and covered him with a blanket for the long road home.[Chapter 3] (Authors note: Hey all. Thanks for waiting for the next chapter to finish. This takes place the same night as the previous chapter.) \"A hidden secret is only as interesting as the person who keeps it.\" Evil-Copper \"Copper! Copper! Get over here!\" shouted and whistled Amis Slade, trying to find his missing hound dog. It was not like Copper to disappear in the middle of the night and, like all pet owners, Amis was worried. \"Chief! Find 'em boy!\" he then commanded his grey Irish wolfhound, who was now old and resting peacefully inside his barrel. He was clearly in no mood to go out looking for his adopted son in the middle of the night but soon realized that his master was not going to do it so he eventually, and rather reluctantly, got up and left in search of Copper. After the incident where Tod almost sacrificed himself to save Copper and their master by taking on the bear and falling into a dam, Chief could see that the hound dog meant a lot to him. He would never have anticipated Copper saving Tod from being shot but Amis, showing him that they will forever be friends. Since that day, Tod had earned his respect but never showed it around his master. Although he was not entirely happy about the friendship the two sheared, it at least gave him and starting point. He then decided to start his search at the Tweed farm. Chief took a slow walk to where he presumed Copper was. He soon reached the Tweed farm and found Copper peering through the window near the living room. Chief expected to find him near the house but would have not anticipated him looking through one of the windows. He knew all too well that Copper was unaware that he had now been found. In an effort to give him a small fright, he raised his voice slightly and said, \"Hiya sonny. Where yea been. The master has been lookin' everywhere for yea.\" His Southern voice easily recognized by the hound dog. Although Copper recognized his stepfather's voice, he was still caught in the place Chief disliked most. He jumped away from the window in an attempt to look innocent, unaware of the mutual respect for Tod.\" Oh, h-hello Chief\" was his only response. His heart slowly increasing its beating. \"What happened to yea this afternoon? Me and master almost had fits when we couldn't find yea,\" said Chief, trying to milk as much out of this as he could. \"Well… I saw Widow Tweed going down the road in a rush, and…\" The hound dog came to his senses and realized who he was speaking to, Tod's worst enemy. Before he could continue, Copper found himself being interrupted by Chief, \"It's okay. I understand that yea are worried about your friend.\" Copper had now been caught, but something seemed off in his mind. Here he was, face to face with the only person who hated Tod more than Amis Slade. His mind was turned upside down. \"Whoa, whoa, whoa… hold on! You seem oddly OK with this whole thing. Who are you and what have you done with Chief?\" Copper blurted out, unable to understand any of it. The confused hound dog was struggling to make sense of what had taken place before him. His entire life, he has found Chief to loath the fox, but now found a side of the wolfhound he had never seen before. It had hit him. Chief must have seen or found out about when Tod saved him and his master. Chief sighed saying, \"I mighta miss judged that poor fox. I've ain't ever seen a stronger friendship then the one y'all have. He should be back in the mornin'. Come on, we ought to get home, Master's worried.\" The two stood up and left for home. The stillness of the morning was broken by the sound of a car approaching the Tweed farm. Copper instantly heard and recognized the two-cylinder motorcar. He stood up and ran to the farm, hoping to catch Tod on the way in and see what happened. He dashed up the driveway and the car stopped abruptly just shy of the him. Widow Tweed hooted at the dog, causing Tod to wake up. The distraught fox slowly raised up onto his front paws to investigate what was going on. Widow Tweed was exhausted and in no mood for any delays. She switched the car off, picked up Tod with both hands and walked to her house in a rush, completely forgetting to close her car doors. She heard barking and looked to find Copper walking after her and staring at the bewildered fox. \"Tod, what's happening\" he called out, trying to get his best friend's attention. Tod had fallen into a deep sleep and was not going to wake up soon after. Widow Tweed opened the door and walked inside, slamming the door behind her. She then gently set Tod's exhausted body in his bed and went to sleep soon after. Copper stared blankly at the door, unable to comprehend what had just happened. He only understood that Tod was in a bad way. He had known the fox for a considerable amount of time, but not once has he seen his best friend in such and unpleasant state. He rushed to the living room window and peered through it, only to find his best friend sleeping in an uncomfortable position. He could not bear the sight of his friend in a bad way and not being able to do much about it. He then decided to return home and report to Chief. As Copper arrived, he saw that Amos Slade was bending down and talking to Chief, \"Chief ol boy. I'm afraid that that fox ain't gonna be with us much longer.\" Copper was too far off to hear what was being said but was curios to find out. His walking pace soon became a jog after he saw the unhappy expression of his stepfather. Once he arrived to find out what was the problem, Amos stood up and walked inside. Copper couldn't quite tell of it was good or bad time to report to Chief about his best friends return. He approached the wolfhound, who had become seriously disturbed. \"Chief? You alright?\" asked Copper quietly, trying not to raise an alarm. Chief slowly raised his head, realizing that he would have to tell his adopted son the news. \"Copper? Oh… hiya Copper. I'm ok. Um… look, I kinda got somethin' to tell yea. Yea might wanna sit.\" Hearing these words, the hound dog sat down, uneasily watching his guardian. Chief took a deep breath in and said, \"Well, this ain't gonna be easy for me to admit to yea, but I've kinda grown awfully fond of yea friend. Copper, there ain't no easy way for me to tell yea and I know yea ain't gonna like it, but yea have to know. Tod had a stroke last night.\" Copper was shocked at the sound of this devastating news. He started shifting around while Chief continued, \"He only has a few weeks left in him and will almost no movement in his rear legs.\" \"Is… is that what happened last night?\" he asked, Chief nodded in agreement. He noticed that Copper was now unsettled by the news. Copper now looked up at the wolfhound, and with a tear forming in the corner of his eye, he asked, \"Now what?\" Chief could only think of one word which, although was small, its meaning went deep into his adopted sons heart, \"Time.\"[Chapter 4] (Authors note: Hi once again. Considering that I have a major fascination with The Fox and the Hound, I decided to take it a bit into the unknown. Hope you enjoy. Please R&R.;) \"A blind past can make way to the present, only to find a way into the future it created.\" Evil-Copper Days pasted by, which felt like weeks with Copper trying continuously to reach Tod and check up on his progress, but Widow Tweed would not let Tod out when he was near. Chief had become concerned and worried about the two of them. Amos Slade noticed the hound dog wondering off to the farm. He didn't quite like his dogs' affiliation with the fox, but never tried to stop them. One night, about a month after Tod's stroke. The two dogs were sitting outside, finishing of their supper, when all of a sudden, a slightly familiar scent passed their noses and caused them to stop eating. It was the scent of an approaching fox. To Copper, it was the smell of a female fox, but to Chief, it was a scent like no other. Without warning, the wolfhound stood up and charged towards where the smell originated. Copper got up soon after and ran after Chief in fear of him finding Vixey, Tod's mate. Copper eventually caught up with Chief who had found and cornered the female fox. \"Chief, wait!\" Copper raised his voice to the snarling wolfhound. Chief was not happy that he was being commanded by his adopted son. He turned his head to face the hound dog, frustrated by his order. \"Why?\" asked Chief, practically shouting, \"Do yea know who this is? This is the very first fox who ever escaped me.\" \"Just wait!\" shouted Copper. Chief was not happy at all about this. \"Make it quick!\" reprimanded Chief, he sat down and kept his eyes fixed on the vixen. \"Hello, my name is Copper\" he said, slowly walking to the old fox. She slowly started to bear her teeth. \"It's okay. I am not here to hurt you. I just want to talk. Are you Vixey?\" he asked as he was only told about Tod's mate. \"No. my name is Rose. I used to live around here until I was hunted by him,\" the vixen says, changing her faces direction to Chief. Rose was quite slender for her age. Her soft red and white coat starting to become grey with two small bald spots in the middle of her back. Her voice was smooth and soft. Her body language showed that she had been through a lot in her life and was stronger because of these times. Chief knew who Vixey was and was not pleased about the fact that Tod's mate had sent the fox he least liked to them. He started shifting impatiently, \"Copper, come on boy. Hurry up.\" \"Chief, wait. Rose, why did Vixey send you here?\" Copper asked. His face was a mixture of curiosity and uncertainty. Rose then started lowering her head, struggling to keep her memories from overflowing. She looked back up and said, \"I was being hunted my him and had to save the last piece of my family. I remember it like it was yesterday. I placed him down by the fence post and ran the other way to draw the attention away from him…\" her explanation was cut short as she started crying, her emotions became more apparent. Sniffling, she continued, \"I was shot in my back twice but managed to get away. After I got back when the hunters were gone, he was gone.\" Rose had, by now, started crying more audibly and felt exhausted. Copper walked over to her and tried to comfort her, sitting beside her and looked at Chief, who had been sitting quietly for some time. Copper noticed that his guardian's expression had become more guilty then angry. Slowly rising to his feet, Chief realized that there was a way to rectify his actions. He approached the two in front of him and said, \"Well, I think I can help yea with that. Follow me.\" Chief then turned around and waited for the others to get up before he started walking off. Meanwhile, on the Tweed farm, Tod had become more aware and used to his disability. This, however, would not stop the determined fox from trying to walk again. He might not have had full control or much feeling in his rear legs but he never gave up. He started walking about a week and a half after his stroke and although it was a slow process, he eventually became strong enough to walk around the house and, occasionally, to the barn and back. Widow Tweed had found books in the library and started reading and understanding more about strokes. She also allowed her fox to walk around freely but would go searching and calling for him after fifteen minutes. Copper, Chief and Rose had reached the dark farmhouse. Copper turned to face Rose and Chief, saying, \"I have a plan. Wait out of sight while I call him out.\" As the two left for a hiding spot, Copper turned around and quietly walked to the living room window, leapt up and peered through the glass to see if his best friend was home. However, before he could find Tod, a streak of red came at him from the bush, hitting him hard on his side and sending him crashing hard on the ground, causing a whine to escape from his sore body. As he lay there in pain, a dark figure approached him and jumped on top of him, growling at the hound dog beneath it. \"Shh…\" said the dark figure said. Copper realized the dark figure was another vixen. She stopped growling and said softly, \"It's me Vixey. Can you please tell me what you are doing,\" she said uncalmly. Copper lay there on his back. The pain shooting through his side did not stop a confused expression from showing in his face. Climbing of him, Vixey shook her head and stared at Copper as he got up. She said, \"I hope you know that Widow doesn't know of your friendship. So imagine what she would do if she saw you, a hunting dog, staring through the window, looking at her fox. I mean… you know what you did not too long ago.\" The hound dog then remembered that he had hunted the two of them. \"Why don't you go and wait with the others while I help you out?\" she continued and walked to the door. Copper turned around and left in search of Chief and Rose to report on the change of plans. He reached the two, only to find that they had made up and began chatting away like long lost friends. Rose turned around, expecting to see Copper with a fox but only saw Copper. Chief only heard Copper a second later and turned to face him. The hound dog looked at the two who gazed at him. They became confused as to why he was with them and not finding his friend. Chief was the first to express his confusion and asked, \"Sonny, what yea doin' over here. I thought you was out findin' him.\" Copper turned his head to face Vixey. Once Vixey was at the door, she looked around to see of her friends were out of sight. She then turned around and scraped her claws against the door. She heard two sets of footsteps closing in on the door. As it opened, Tod went straight for the gap, trying to get out, but his efforts were for nothing when Widow Tweed reached down for him and tried to pull him back. Once Tod realized that his mate was trying to enter, he backtracked to allow Vixey to enter. After she entered, she looked up at Widow and nodded as if to say thank you. \"Tod!\" she screeched at the sight of her mate alive and standing. She ran up to him and nuzzled her face and body along his neck. Tod gave Vixey a light lick on his cheek and asked, \"How are you? I've been worried sick, I heard what happened. How bad is it?\" Tod really didn't want to talk about his condition but his mate deserved to know. Lowering his head and folding his ears down, Tod took a deep breath before saying, \"It's quite serious. The doctor suspects that I… have just a few days left.\" Vixey gasped and stared at her mate, whose eyes had begun to fill with tears. He sobbed softly, trying not to alert Widow Tweed. The vixen dropped her head, trying to show sympathy. Her watering eyes shut as she tried to hold back the tears. She could not bear to see her mate crying. She then took control over herself and continued with the plan. She then stood up, without warning, and turned around to walk to the door. Tod noticed this and followed her. \"Wait…Where are you going?\" Tod asked as he managed to get next to her while she scraped at the door, calling Widow Tweed to open it for her. \"I think you mean where are we going ,\" Vixey said as Widow reached the door, swinging it wide open. The two foxes walked out side by side, letting their owner know that they would stay together. The door closed behind them as they made their way towards the barn. Once inside, Vixey told her mate to wait quietly as she needed to go somewhere quickly. Tod lay down on the hay pile as she watched his mate leave through the front door. She turned her head around to see if he had listened. She then raced towards Copper, Rose and Chief. She arrived to see all three of them watching her with content. \"OK, we will have to do this is stages,\" she said looking at Copper, \"You first, just keep in mind his condition. Once you are ready, you give us a signal, me and Chief will go in, and only once he has calmed down, Rose will enter. Everybody fine with that?\" Everybody nodded in agreement, as Copper stood up and left for the barn.[Chapter 5] (Authors note: Hi all. The first few chapters will have come through quickly, but I'm afraid the rest will take some tie due to exams. Enjoy.) \"Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by doing so some have unwittingly entertained angles.\" The Bible Hebrews 13:2 Inside the barn, Tod had become anxious, waiting for Vixey to return. He heard footsteps approaching and instantly turned his attention to the door. Moments later, a brown spotted hound dog walked in. he looked around and found the red fox sitting in the hay pile at the other end of the barn. \"Copper!\" shouted Tod in excitement as he raised to his feet. His best friend called back, \"Tod!\" and ran over to the happy fox. He was finally with his best friend and nothing could take that away from him. He reached Tod and told him to sit down. \"How yea, Tod? I tried to see yea but couldn't get in.\" His face turned more serious as worry filled him upon seeing the fox's poor stance and coat. Tod didn't think twice before he answered his best friend. He sighed and said, \"Yeah, s-sorry about that, Widow doesn't fully trust you after what happened before the bear. I can't walk far so I couldn't reach yea. I um… I have some bad news. Copper, I had a major stroke about 3 weeks ago and the doctor says I haven't much time left.\" The hound dog's eyes opened upon hearing this, the worst words to come out of his friend's mouth. \"Well, we are all here for you,\" Copper said, giving the queue for Vixey and Copper to enter, and leaving Rose outside for now. Tod saw Vixey first, but as Chief walked in, Tod instantly went into defense mode, raising his hair and standing crouched, bearing his teeth. The grey wolfhound realized what was happening and tried to calm the fox down by saying, \"Easy now, I ain't here to fight. I just wanna make things right.\" Tod relaxed just enough to frown. No words have ever confused him more than these. Chief, his worst enemy, was standing in front of him, trying to make amends for past faults, ranging from teaching Copper to hate him, teaching and telling Copper to hunt him and all the little things in between. Chief noticed the fox's hair lower and his body language relax slightly. He explained further, \"Tod, I shoulda realized sooner that I was wrong about yea. I didn' see what was right in front of me.\" He then paused for a short while to let it sink in. Continuing, he said, \"I saw yea, yea know…savin' Copper and our master. I only saw then what the two of you mean to each other. For that, I owe you a thanks and apology.\" Copper had known Chief longer then he had known Tod, and yet has never seen him show gratitude the way he just did. Chief felt relieved now that he had shared his deepest secret with everyone. He looked up and noticed that Tod had stood up and was now approaching him. His hair now flat and his eyes filled with the desire to forgive and forget. Tod stopped just before the wolfhound, raised his head to meet his eyes and said, \"And I'm sorry for almost having you killed.\" With that, they found an understanding for each other's motives. A drawn out silence filled the air as they studied one another. Tod broke the silence, now more relaxed and aware that they were up to something. \"I know you guys aren't all here just to apologies and check up on me. What are you guys hiding?\" He asked, curiously looking at Copper and Vixey. He could tell when they were keeping something under wraps. Vixey then looked over to Chief and nodded, giving him the final queue. He nodded back and started walking outside while Copper and Vixey stood up and sat right up against the red fox with one on each side. \"Tod,\" said Copper sternly, grabbing his best friends attention. \"Before we show you, you have to agree that you will remain calm,\" he continued. The fox nodded. They turned their attention to the main door as Chief called out, \"Are yea ready?\" with a soft reply, \"Ready.\" Chief then turned around and came into view, waiting for Rose to get beside him. Tod curiously watched the old female fox walking in towards them. He studied her carefully as she did the same to him. They were both unsure if what was happening was real. Neither Tod nor Rose recognized one another. Chief soon stopped walking and left Rose to approach the three sitting in a row. Rose was unsure of how to proceed and so was Tod. He realized that since he was younger and male, that he should take up the gentleman's role and introduced himself first. He faced the fox in front of him and said, \"Hello. I'm Tod. I live on the farm here.\" \"Hello Tod. My name is Rose. I used to live near the farm here but haven't seen you around before now,\" Rose replied softly, surprised at how forward and upfront he was. He then said, \"Well, I can't really get out much and I was also kicked out a while ago.\" Tod was completely oblivious to what was going on. He then wondered if he was stepping over a line as he curiously asked, \"I'm sorry but should I know you?\" Rose's facial expression quickly changed as these words came out of Tod's mouth. Rose began to feel her eyes water and her thought dry as she replied, \"No, But you have always been in my heart.\" Her voice has started cracking as she tried to form the words she thought she would never have the chance to say, \"I-I miss you my boy.\" After saying this, Rose started crying loudly as she could no longer hold back the tears. Tears of pain and gladness. She had finally found her son. Tod was staggered and his eyes went blank. As far as he knew, his mother was shot and killed by a hunter. So how could this be her? He had never seen her around and had almost no evidence that what she was saying was the truth. Coming back to his senses, he spotted two scars on her lower back, which were obviously old, and then it hit him. Rose was his mother. \"Mom?\" Tod asked, starting to become shaky. His eyes had started watering. \"Is-is it really you?\" His voice started fading and his heart slowly started sinking, unable to cope with the news and the blood clot all at ones. Rose looked up and took in the sight of the awe struck fox sitting before her. She stood up, walked over to him and rustled her neck against his. The two foxes made the long lost discovery of the family they believed were dead. Copper and Vixey were about to give them time on their own when Vixey felt the wait of her mate start pressing down on her. She turned around to find her mate toppling over onto her.[Chapter 6] (Authors note: Hi all. The first few chapters will have come through quickly, but I'm afraid the rest will take some time due to exams. Enjoy. And PLEASE REVIEW.) \"No matter how painful, there's always a sense of relief in the end of something you knew was supposed to be over.\" Leo Christopher Tod's eyes closed slowly as his body hit the ground. Vixey was the first to react, trying to wake the fox lying next to her. She nuzzled his head with her paw. Then, without warning, Tod's body stiffened and rolled over, giving his friends and family a fright. His eyes flickered open and his head looked around curiously. He then got up, using his front paws as leavers. His head felt as if it was a vinyl record spinning around on a turntable. He gave his eyes a chance to adjust again before turning his head around to find a sea of confused faces. They couldn't understand what was going on, not even Tod knew, but one thing was sure. He had started gaining feeling in his legs again. \"Tod? Are you alright?\" Vixey asked, breaking the silence that covered the barn. Tod had to think quickly. He said, \"I… I'm not sure…My head is spinning but otherwise, I feel great.\" He realized what he had said. He looked down at his legs with confusion, \"My legs,\" he said, \"I can feel them!\" He looked at the sea of confused faces staring attentively at him. Tod decided to try his rear legs by standing up on all fours. He slowly stood up and sat down soon after, feeling a sharp pain drive up his now sensitive legs. He looked over to his mate and saw in her eyes that there was something she needed to say. Vixey saw this as a good opportunity to tell her mate the good news, as everybody they knew was present. \"Tod,\" she said calling to her mate, \"I…uh…Kind of have some good news you need to know about.\" The fox snapped into attention and faced Vixey, happily replying, \"Yes, Vixey.\" Before letting out the news, she took a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves. She eventually gained enough confidence to say, \"I'm pregnant.\" Tod's mouth opened wide as the words filled his head. His mind started working overtime, trying to figure out what he just heard. He couldn't understand how as his mate had not been around for three weeks before now. \"How? It was only one night and even so, it was a while ago.\" Vixey found his lack of knowledge somewhat funny. She giggled as she approached him and said, \"Well, it looks like once was enough.\" She licked his cheek and smiled at him. Copper, Rose and Chief surrounded the couple and congratulated them. They continued chatting for a while longer. Tod was eager to show Widow that he was getting better and that Vixey was going to be a mother, but most of all, he wanted to show Rose who had been looking after him. Tod looked at his mother before saying, \"Mom, I would like you to meet somebody.\" Rose nodded in approval. \"Can the rest of you please come with? Widow needs to know who my friends really are.\" Their heads bobbed up and down in unison. They stood up and waited for Tod to lead the group. Once they were near the farm house, Tod heard the distinctive sound of Widow Tweeds telephone. He quickened his pace to the point where his legs were screaming from the jolts running up his sensitive legs. He had to slow down as the pain became almost unbearable. He reached the farm house with Copper and Vixey by his side and the old pair walking slowly behind them, unaware that they had been left behind. Inside, Widow Tweed answered the phone, merrily greeting the person on the other end, \"Hello?\" Although she was in a good mood, Tod was still in her mind. The greeting was returned by a shout, \"Widow…Help!\" It didn't take long for her to recognize Amos's voice was bouncing around in her head. She dropped the earpiece without hanging up and headed straight for her car. She started it and set off to help her friend, not noticing that her fox was right by the window. The three heard Amos Slade's shouts from the earpiece hanging from the wire just as Rose and Chief reached them. Copper and Vixey took off first as Tod told the wolfhound what he had heard. They set off after Widow's car at an astonishing rate, but were unable to keep up. They soon regrouped and ran as a pack. Tod was struggling to keep up due to his sore paining legs. He started to fall back but his mother adjusted her speed and stuck next to him. Widow was the first to arrive. Sitting in her car, she carefully studied the house but couldn't find anything out of order. She was about to open the door when, out the corner of her eye, she saw movement in the rear view mirror. She adjusted it to focus on the group of animals rushing towards her. She recognized four of the five animals running together. She saw Vixey, Copper and Chief in a row in the front and Tod with an older female fox running alongside him. Eyes wide and full of worry, Widow got out of the car and faced the group of animals racing towards her. Tod had begun limping as the discomfort in his legs grew to such an extent that he dropped to the ground, screaming as jolts of excruciating pain shot through his sensitive legs. \"Tod!\" shouted Copper as he turned around and headed to his crying friend. Rose continued running, unaware that her son had fallen until Copper ran past her. The hound dog reached the crying fox and turned his head back to the group, \"HELP! Somebody help!\" All eyes had turned to see Tod laying on the floor in pain. Rose ran back to them as fast as she could. She reached her son screaming blue murder as he lay on the grass. Her motherly instincts took over as she lay down, pressing her body against Tod's. She raised her head to Copper and said, \"I got him, go.\" The two dogs and Vixey turned around and raced towards Widow Tweed, who saw everything that had just happened.[Chapter 7] (Authors Note: Hi everyone, sorry to keep you guys waiting for such a long time but mid-year exams are killing me. I hope you guys enjoy this as much as I did writing it. Please read and review.) \"A bully turned friend, is friend to the end.\" Chinese proverb Widow curiously watched the dogs and Vixey closing on her location as they ran side by side. What a peculiar sight, she thought to herself. Her eyes were swimming at the sight of hunters and the hunted running alongside each other without wanting to slaughter one another. Her gaze then fell upon Tod lying on the ground, whining in pain while an older fox lay beside him, in a soothing position. Almost as if Rose could feel the worried look that was set on her, she lifted her head and looked at Widow. She was obviously afraid of leaving Tod there, but with someone there, she changes her attention to the group of three as they reached her. They stared at the old lady as if waiting for a command. Before she could think of something, a defining bang filled the air. Everyone, including the laying foxes, turned to face where it came from. After a second bang went off, Copper and Chief took off to the sound of the pump action shotgun. Shortly after a third shot was fired, a roar of pain and a heavy thud on the ground encouraged Widow to follow the hunting dogs and Vixey stayed as close to Widow as was physically possible, leaving Tod under Roses care. Copper reached the place where they heard the shots originated from with Chief arriving seconds later. A large figure slumped on a chopped tree stump lay motionlessly on its stomach. The two walked over to examine the lump of fur. A pool of blood lay around a body with a familiar scent. Its jagged teeth and scars with missing fur revealed the truth. The bear was the one that Tod saved Copper from. The sound of a a shotgun being reloaded snapped them out of their investigation and fixed it on Amos Slade erratically reloading his gun while his stare fixed on the bear. Widow Tweed and Vixey rounded the corner and stopped shortly after when the sight of the bear shocked them. Widow gasped as she realized what was going on. She was only told about the bear and had never seen it until now. She then looked down at the vixen to see if she recognized it, only to find her walking with the hound dog circling the corpse. Her eyes then spotted movement by a nearby tree and walked over to it, expecting to find Amos in shock. \"Copper, is it the one Big Mama told me about?\" Vixey asked as the hound dog stopped walking and turned his head to face the bears. He took a long look at the scars on the bear, allowing a flood of memories to wash over him. The way he pursued the fox couple with his mind hell bent on revenge, the way in which he mercilessly chased after his best friend for injuring his guardian and the way his best friend almost sacrificed himself to save the people trying to kill him. Copper took a while before he answered the vixen, \"Yea, but by the look of things, he won't be much of a problem.\" He looked around after realizing Chief had become quiet. Not thinking much about it, Copper turned around and was about to head off to Tod when he saw something which made his eyes water and his heart fill with pride. There Chief was, walking towards him with Rose next to him and Tod in the middle. The fox might have still been in pain, but only showed it with a slight limp. Dry tear lines and mud on his side remained from the fall earlier. The trio walked to where Copper and Vixey where standing. The vixen had not noticed them but Copper did. He was staggered at just how quickly Chief and Rose had let bygones be bygones, but was more surprised at how quick Tod had recovered. Vixey turned around, now aware that Copper was no longer with her, and saw the group. She rushed towards them towards them with the hound dog following closely. They soon reached the trio and Vixey wasted no time in rubbing her body length along her mate's neck. Tod responded by lightly pressing against her back before slowly sitting down. Copper waited patiently for the pair's moment to pass, well aware that they had almost lost each other. Once they had finished, he walked up to his best friend, \"Tod, I… I shoulda told yea this a while ago, but I'm sorry.\" Looking at Vixey as if to repeat his apology, he could tell no words were needed. Rose stared blankly at Copper, not knowing what he was apologizing for. Although she was not particularly interested in what it was for, she assumed that it was for something major. She snapped to attention before anyone noticed her thoughtful stare. She shook her head as she started to realize that an awkward silence had formed around them. \"Well,\" said Tod, \"I think it's time we started heading home.\" His tired gaze shifted between his mother and his mate. They nodded in agreement when they saw the look in his eyes. Tod then shifted his sight to Copper and the wolfhound next to him, \"Thank you guys. For helping me and checking up on me, but most importantly, thanks for reuniting me with my mother.\" He then stood up and began to walk home with Rose and Vixey by his side.[Chapter 8] (Authors note: Hi guys. this is going to be continued but will take a while before I can.) \"Life is tough, my darling, but so are you.\" Author unknown Two weeks had gone by and everything seemed right. The sun was out and there was nothing more than a slight breeze in the air as autumn had found its way home. Home, something virtually foreign to Rose, had now become livelier with the addition of the old vixen. Like most creatures, it took a while before she settled in with the family but after a while, she was happier than ever. Rose lay outside on the front steps, basking in the sun as she tried to catch as much as she could before the winter months. Her mind was clear of thought and her body motionless. Although she was calm, her senses had not become used to the worry free life. Her ears flinched as she heard distant chatter and the sound of snapping twigs drawing closer. She opened her eyes and raised her head to see who was coming. \"Hiya Rose, sorry if we scared yea,\" said Chief as he came into the vixens line of sight with Copper closely following him. \"Oh, it's alright. Hello to you too guys,\" Rose replied as she began sitting up, \"What brings you here?\" Copper answered before Chief could. \"We just came by to check how things are going.\" The old vixen stood up and walked to the door saying, \"why don't you come in and find out.\" Tod and Vixey were laying in a large basket that Widow Tweed had bought for the family. Tod's legs had gone back to normal and, according to Dr Mulligan, the clot in his brain was free. His head couldn't quite wrap around the fact that his mother was still alive, but he knew that it would take time. Vixey, on the other hand, enjoyed the older vixen's company. She was going to be a a mother herself soon and needed to know what to expect. Her bulging belly told her that it was only a matter of time before the kits would arrive and that she needed to relax. Rose walked in the room first to make sure the couple were awake. \"Hello, are you awake?\" she asked as she approached the basket, \"you have visitors.\" Tod looked at his mother before sitting up. \"Mom, I think the kits are close,\" he said with worry in his voice as he looked down at his mate, who had begun breathing more rapidly and audibly. Copper and Chief took the sound as trouble and ran into the room. Tod started to panic. Widow Tweed was out in town and the three males knew nothing about birth. Rose knew that she was the only one who could help the younger vixen. Vixey had begun growling and groaning as she went into labor. \"Okay,\" said Rose, taking charge, \"you boys might wanna head on out. It can get quite bloody.\" the males took the queue and bolted for the door. Once outside, Copper and Chief thought they could finally talk, but that was not going to happen as long as Tod remained panicky. They tried to take his mind of Vixey, asking, \"How yea been?\" the fox simply ignored the question, pacing up and down with worry. Copper knew he it was going to take more than a few words to snap him out of his deep thought. He then stood up and walked in his way and said with the most firm yet calm voice, \"Hey! Relax. Your mother probably has it under control.\" Tod continued to walk and soon found himself walking into his friends body, pulling him out of his dream. \"Tod, are you okay?\" asked the hound dog as the fox fixed his stare one the house. \"Y-Yea, I'll be alright,\" replied the fox. He was worried and didn't do a good job of hiding it. \"And you guys?\" \"We're good,\" replied Copper, \"and Vixey will be too, so relax.\" Before Tod could respond, a rustling noise was heard in the tree that stole their attention. Up in the tree were two birds peering into a small hole in the bark. There mischievous Laughs, and silly grins could only mean one thing. \"Boomer, sh... This is the last time I'm tracking this guy, so you better not miss,\" said a slightly aggravated yellow Finch. \"Don't worry, D-Dinky. He ain't getting away this t-time. But just one small problem,\" said the taller woodpecker before shouting, \"WE CAN'T EAT A B-B-BUTTERFLY!\" Without a word, Dinky flew to eye level and wrapped his feet around the woodpecker's beak. As he did so, the butterfly exited the hole and flew off. \"Now see what yea done! yea forever costing us our breakfast!\" angrily shouted the finch.[Chapter 9] (Authors note: Hi all. Sorry to keep you waiting but there are a few complications at home and I have little time to myself. Please leave reviews and criticisms are welcome.) \"Everything you ever wanted is on the other side of fear.\" Author unknown \"What in the world is going on out here?\" reprimanded an old owl as she walked out of her nest in a fit of anger. She approached the boys in a fit of anger over her disrupted sleep, \"I thought I...\" She stopped as her gaze fell upon Tod, Copper and Chief, who were watching her with hard stares. Her eyes widened as her fears were realized. Tod, a fox, and two hunting dogs were standing side by side without a hint of discomfort. She had seen the way Copper savagely chased him and Vixey but she had also seen what happened to Chief. All this, however, was overruled by Copper's heroic gesture of saving the fox from Amos Slade. \"Hiya, Big Mama,\" Said Tod with a small smile on his face. He was happy to see the old owl and visa versa. Big Mama flew down and landed on the fence. \"Goodmornin', Tod. I see you have got yourself a new friend,\" she said as she pointed over to the wolfhound. \"Yeah, things have started to calm down enough for us to forgive and forget. How yea been? Haven't seen yea around in a while,\" curiously asked Tod. Big Mama needed to think carefully for the right words to use, \"I had to go and help out a friend of mine. How are you?\" asked the owl, trying to catch up on what she had missed. \"I'm good. My legs are better now so I can't really complain,\" was the fox's reply. Big Mama raised her eyebrow in confusion. Dinky couldn't help but blurt out, \"What do yea mean ' better now '? did yea have cramps or something?\" The spotlight had now shifted to Tod as he felt the weight of heavy gazes falling on him. Copper and Chief knew that the topic would still be a bit raw for his liking. When copper and Chief tried to intervene,They were cut short by the foxes hoarse voice. Big mama started to think hard about the words that came out of its mouth before he continued, \"Big mama, Don't freak out when I tell you. Un... I kind of had a stroke about a month and a half ago and I was almost fox down.\" The old are covered a beak with a wing. She then interrupted his explanation, \"Uh hu... And I don't suppose you got your surprise about 2 weeks ago did you?\" Total surprise erupted from the question. Tod wasn't 100% sure if what he was hearing he was believing. \"Wait, how did you know?\" Today asked, Baffled by knowledge. B ig mama giggle before saying, \"Your welcome.\" At that moment, Rose walked out of the house and was met by a wall of gazes. Hello, Big Mama,\" Rose said softly as she approached the tree and found a spot between Tod and Chief. \"Why, hello there, Rose. I suspect you've found yourself a new home. What's it like having a son again?\" Big Mama asked the vixen. She moved over to her son before nuzzling him and saying, \"It's as if we never parted. I guess you were right when you said 'love never forgets.\" The moment could not have been unpredictable, until she moved over to Chief, who was unaware of the advance. Rose soon reached the wolfhound and started rubbing against him as she continued, \"And it seems to have its perks.\" Although he had fur covering his cheeks, his face was visibly becoming red. Tod had heard Vixey and his mother talking on various occasions about this, so he wasn't all that shocked. He then turned to see who was more in shock, Big Mama or Copper, but rather predictably, the bloodhound was the most dumbfounded. \"Whoa, whoa. Time out!\" Dinky blurted out as she covered his eyes. \"This just became awkward,\" Copper was the next to react as an air of unusual love covered the group. It was unusual for a fox and a hunting dog to become best friends, let alone have feelings for one another. They knew that it was... wrong, for a lack of better words, bet they didn't care. They only wanted each other. The past is the past and cannot be reversed, but they were only interested in the present. They looked into one another's eyes, only love and trust could be found. \"Oh my, I hope you two know what your gettin' into,\" Big Mama said to try and stop them from becoming to physical in front of everyone. \"We know, we just don't care about others judging us.\" replied Rose, Chief blushing too much to utter a word. Looking over to her son, she couldn't help but notice how anxious he was. (Authors note: Sorry about my chapters becoming shorter and shorter each time, but problems arise and... well, you know the rest. One more chapter after this and the fanfic will be completed. I was also thinking about making a sequel to this called \"The Future Depends On The Present\", but I'm not convinced I should due to the lack of reviews.

I was serious about what I said in the previous chapter, if I receive enough reviews and favorites, I will make a sequel. please read and review.) \"A truth can always be found by those who seek it\" Evil-Copper Dinky and Boomer were about to speak up, when a flutter of blue flew past them. Squeaks had drawn there attention and, in a hurry to catch him, Dinky half shouted, \"Hey kid, we gonna have to finish this another time. Nice seeing you again, And stay out of trouble!\" He then took off after the butterfly while shouting at the woodpecker behind him, \"Come on, Boomer, he's getting away!\" The pair took off in a flutter of feathers, furiously following their lost breakfast. Tod was too fixated on his mother to bid them farewell. He started becoming impatient waiting for something, anything on his mate. Rose finally stood up and approached her son, noticing that he became more and more anxious with each step she took. She reached her son with a well devised plan to bring back sweet memories. She had been told about the day Vixey decided how many kits she wanted. She sat in front of her nerve wreaked son and asked him a simple question, \"My boy, do you remember what Vixey said would be 'Just right'?\" Flashback Shortly after Big Mama helped the two of them after a little squabble, They continued walking further into the forest. They were idly chatting, until a Quail walked in front of them. She was a few centimeters away from a crack in the ground with water in it. After she looked back to find her chicks close behind her, she jumped over the the crack with her chicks one after the other. Vixey counted as they did, \"One, two, three, four, five, six...\" her counting was slowed down by the seventh chick as he tried but failed to jump across, landing in the water, \"Seven, haha.\" She let out a short laugh, took a deep breath and sighed, \"Oh, I think six would be just right.\" Just before completing her sentence, she continued walking, leaving Tod confused. \"Six?\" Tod asked curiously as was unsure of what the statement meant. Once he caught up to her, he asked, \"Six what?\" End of Flashback \"Congratulations, Tod Honey,\" Big Mama said as she floated down from her branch and landed on the fox's back, only to be knocked off by Copper as he toppled his best friend over with excitement. Chief followed shortly after, landing on his adopted son. They soon climbed off Tod and allowed him to walk inside with his mother by his side. They walked over to the basket and found a sight which would soften the hardest of hearts. There Vixey lay, her face a mixture of excitement and pride, while the rest of her body relieved pain, discomfort and exhaustion. By her side were six beautiful kits. Tod's heart raced as he darted outside to call the rest, only to find they had left. He shrugged the thought off and walked back inside. Rose lay in the basket, but left a space for her son between the two vixens. He saw that they were both asleep and tried to climb in without waking either of them up. his heart was full of joy. He lay down and soon after fell asleep, allowing him to dream about about the day he felt his children's love. Dream (Tod's POV) A few days after my mother and I were reunited, things started looking up. Vixey, well, I guess you could say that her stomach now had a bulge to it. Nothing too serious though. She would lay in our basket all day, as if she were expecting her kits any moment. Although my mom couldn't help but spend as much time with me as possible, she'd never stay the whole night. I guess it takes time to become accustomed to walls surrounding you. She would get up as early in the morning as Big Mama would fall asleep, just to make sure that we were alright. But today, things were different. Mom seemed preoccupied with something. Although she was happy, she seemed distant. She scratched on the door. It looks as if she had been taking lessons from Vixey. She strolled in and thanked Widow Tweed as the old woman opened the door for her. \"Hello Mom,\" my mate and I said in unison. Vixey looked up to the older vixen as a daughter would to her mother. Mom knew that Vixey needed a motherly figure for the upcoming weeks, so she had adopted my mate as her child. \"Hello my darlings. How are you today?\" Her voice as smooth as whipped cream. \"We're good,\" replied Vixey. \"Oh, Dear, you look hungry. Let Tod and I catch some fish for you,\" Mom said and walked to the door and waited for me to come along side her before we left. The walk to the nearby waterhole was quiet. Too quiet. Normally our conversation was long and loud, but I'm not sure why Mom wasn't talking. Fair enough, she did try a few times, unfortunately they were minute. \"Mom, are you okay? You seem down,\" Tod asked as they reached the river. \"Yea, I'm okay,\" Mom replied, \"Just a little lost in thought. I was thinking about your father, how you and him are a lot in common.\" Okay, wasn't waiting for that. We reached the waterhole, but our conversation was far from over. \"You are almost a duplicate of him,\" Mom continued, \"In the last few days, I have noticed the similarities. You love your mate more then Chief loves his front seat,\" she said to emphasize the love Vixey and I shared, \"Vixey even told me about the waterfall, when you saved your friend, and I couldn't help but notice that...\" Mom stopped. \"That?\" \"...That you have the same love as him, not just for your mate, but also for confused friends. You must never give up on what you love, and from what I've heard, that shouldn't be to hard.\" She looked me in the eye, Clearly as if pleading for me to listen and obey. I nodded back at the old vixen. We began fishing soon after. The fishing went well. I had finally caught more then 1, while Mom caught about 6. Practice makes perfect, something I had very little of. The walk home was fairly quiet, but not much can be said with a mouthful of fish. As we reached home, Vixey was shrieking in excitement. Thinking she went into labor while we were absent from the farm, we dropped the fish and dashed inside. There Vixey was, laying in the old basket with her paw on her stomach. \"Vixey, are you okay? We heard screaming,\" It was pretty clear she wasn't in pain, so why was she screaming? When we walked closer, it all became clear. \"Shhhh, come here,\" Vixey said, confusing me and Mom. We quietly walked over to Vixey. When we had come in arms reach, she took our paws and gently placed them on her belly. My heart warmed up, raced and stopped all at once. Something was pushing against our paws, something small and fragile. I looked at my mother, then at my mate. She looked up and met my happily grinning face, it was official. I could feel the small paws pressing against mine, I was soon going to be a father. (Authors note: This was a request off my post of this story.

I've Finally got the inspiration and time to add to the series. Of course, this means that the remainder of my unfinished publications will have to wait a while, and I can explain. For The Fox And The Hound: Upbringing (Continuation), I've been trying to get in contact with the original writer to try and see if I can rewrite the original chapter for my own story, without having to change too much. And, I kinda like where it ended, but I know there are many unanswered questions as to Fyre and Tod. So, it will have to simmer for a while. For The Fox And The Hound: It Should've Been Me, I have hit a block, and have asked the requester how he wants it to go. If he decides to have Vixey out the picture, I will have a plan. I would also like to make note that the original first chapter will be republished as I have too little time to rewrite the entire story. In the update, I am going to keep the original story line, but add a twist that will surprise and maybe even upset some readers. All I have to say for now, is that none of this would have been possible without SteelWingAngel and disneyfangirl774 , not to mention all the favourites and followers. The future title is between: 'When The Present Needs The Past' 'The Past And Present Form The Future' 'The Future Needs The Present' Please help me decide between the two. And also, can someone please recommend a good cover artist? That would be great. See you all in the next installment. ","Summary":" (Authors note: Hi there, first of all this is my first FanFiction story and I would like you to kno"},{"Movie":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang","Title":"Homecoming","Author":"xgraciela","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835556","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Original prompt: Remember the niece, Chloe, who Harry was stealing a Christmas gift for at the beginning of the film? She's always liked Uncle Harry, and is glad for his good fortune in L.A. Her parents are not so pleased; when Harry was the family fuck-up, they looked better by comparison. So when Harry doesn't call in over a year to ask for help, bail money, or to beg off the latest family reunion since his ex-wife has been invited again, they visit L.A. \"to check up on him.\" Perry and Chloe get along well. Unsurprisingly, however, Perry hates her parents on sight. It only gets worse when they try to convince Harry that Perry treats him terribly, and they know what's best for him: moving back to New York. Harry/Perry would be awesome in this (new or established relationship), as would a happy ending. \"Perry! It's just for three days!\" Harry whined, which was strangely effective when dealing with Perry. That and puppy dog's eyes - certainly the best choice. \"Doesn't matter. One day would be too much actually.\" Perry frowned. Unthinkingly, Harry's fingers crumpled the paper with printed-out e-mail from his sister.\"It's my family!\" He somehow needed to point this out and put an accent on the word family. That hurt Perry more than he would ever admit. He was supposed to be Harry's family now when they started sleeping together. \"And my apartment!\" Lame response, but it was true. Harry sighed and averted his gaze. That did the magic. \"Shit, okay! But just for two nights.\" Perry gave in. \"I don't want the house full of people for any longer.\" \"People? It'd be just my sis and little Chloe...\" \"Little? As in...\" \"She's eleven Perry. Don't worry, no diapers needed.\" Harry grinned over his own joke. \"Don't try your luck, chief. They still can stay in a fucking hotel instead.\" Perry warned. \"Okay.\" Harry mumbled. Then he thought about something for a while. \"I guess you should be glad that my brother-in-law isn't coming. He...\" Harry paused, thinking about the best words to use. \"Let's just say that we don't get along very well.\" \"That surprises you?\" It's very hard to put up with your idiotic self.\" However harsh it sounded, there was a small smirk on Perry's face. \"You should know.\" Harry leaned in and kissed Perry lightly. It still felt weird, but he was thrilled to do so whenever he wanted. Perry only rolled his eyes. To say the truth he might have been at least a little bit interested in meeting Harry's relatives. \"Rachel is fine. And I'm sure you'll love Chloe. She's a sweetie,\" Harry told him and smiled a little. \"She must have her uncle's genes then.\" Perry returned the kiss. He just hoped that the visit would be quick and easy. \"Uncle Harry!\" Chloe shouted from the outside and ran so quickly that she almost knocked down Perry, who opened the door to them. \"Hey princess!\" Harry greeted her and they hugged tightly. Her mom stayed outside with a big bag over her shoulder. \"You must be Rachel.\" Perry outstretched his hand. \"Nice to meet you. I'm Perry, Harry's...colleague.\" He and Harry hadn't exactly agreed if they were going to tell Rachel about their relationship. Well, more likely Harry hadn't. Apparently people like Rachel from Embrey, Indiana weren't ready for their brother being gay. \"Um, hi.\" She shook his hand and shifted the bag so it wouldn't fall off. The eyes! Perry noticed at the first sight that it was Harry looking at him through them. They were deep and dark and well...so same. But otherwise this women didn't look like her brother at all. Blonde hair, taller and if not huge then at least good-built. Some wrinkles around her eyes and tired hands. Not like all the chicks here in L.A. Also, she was definitely older than Harry if only a little bit. Still, something told Perry that they wouldn't get along no matter how he would try. Fortunately, it was just for two days and then he and Harry could go back to their normal lives again. \"Um, mind if I come in?\" She asked. Not angrily, but the tone of her voice felt unnatural. Perry hated himself for analyzing her right here at the porch, but he was a fucking P.I. It was his job! \"Sure. Welcome!\" He said and attempted to sound kindly. Meanwhile, Chloe was already sitting on Harry's knee on the couch and these two were chatting like teenage girls. At least Chloe had the appropriate gender and age, Perry though, when he and Rachel came to the living room. Harry was giggling at some joke the girl told him when he saw his sister. He put Chloe down and went to hug Rachel as well. \"Hi! How was the flight?\" \"Oh, don't ask. We almost missed the plane! But Dave...you remember him? ...Yeah, so he gave us ride and we arrived on time.\" She smiled and kissed Harry on his cheek. It surprised Perry how differently this woman acted with Harry around in comparison with their awkward greeting at the door. At once, he started to feel somehow useless and redundant to the party. The three of them just seemed to get along so well. \"Uncle Harry?\" Chloe interrupted and tugged at Harry's sleeve. \"Will you take me to the beach?\" \"Of course sweetie, but you both must be tired. I'll show you your room first, okay?\" Rachel nodded gratefully. \"This guy's your friend, Harry?\" Chloe evidently wasn't done asking yet. That woke Perry from his thoughts and before Harry could say anything, he approached them and smirked at the girl. \"Yes Miss. I'm Perry.\" She smiled and hugged him as well. \"Harry told me you have gun, is it really true?\" She asked, still smiling like an angel. It was hard not to love her. Perry nodded and made a serious face. \"Yeah, but I only use it on the bad guys.\" He winked at her and she giggled. Sometimes he regretted that he might never have kids. He liked children and his mother was craving for grandchildren, but in his situation it wasn't probable to fulfill her wish. Not that he would tell this to anyone. Harry smiled after Perry's wink, but Rachel just rolled her eyes. \"Come on Chloe, let's unpack a bit. Then you can go with Harry to the sea.\" Perry felt useless again, but then something crossed his mind. \"How about something to drink?\" He offered. \"Tea, coffee, juice?\" \"Cocoa, please!\" Chloe pleaded. Perry had to smile. Harry had always acted the same. Offer him three different things and he would take the fourth. Rachel just shook her head. \"No, thank you.\" He nodded politely, but inside he was boiling. How it was possible to hate this woman after first fucking fifteen minutes? Kitchen seemed to be safe for now, so he left to prepare the drinks. Coffee for Harry - he didn't have to ask - and he was in a deep need of some herbal tea for his nerves. ~tbc Thanks for reading![Chapter 2] \"Harry, this is so cool!\" Chloe cheered when she saw the guest room. There was a big sized double bed, but what caught her interest was an enormous picture on the vacant wall. It was the self-adhesive wallpaper, the kind which goes all the way from the ceiling to the floor. It must have been made from an original photo and the sight was amazing. It presented the sunset on the beach. Colors were mostly red and thousands shades of orange with some black shapes. \"You are right honey, I like this one too.\" Harry smiled. Rachel looked around and put down her bag with a small sigh. \"I don't get why to put this on the wall when all you have to do is stick your nose out and you can see it for real.\" Harry shrugged. Big sister is a big sister. You can't argue with her and expect a good outcome. \"Yeah, um...Bathroom is on the opposite side of the hall. There are some fresh towels in the cupboard. And make yourself at home.\" Perry chose this moment to come back with the drinks. He'd never considered himself voyeuristic, yet he hesitated just behind the door so he could listen to the dialogue inside. Chloe was busy unpacking her small backpack and laying all the things neatly on the bedside table. \"Really Harry, this whole house seems so expensive. From both outside and inside. In fact, I'm surprised the fucking handles aren't from gold or something like that. That's so weird.\" She made a face and Harry didn't know how to respond. Perry just wanted to clench his fists. Unfortunately he was still holding the tray, so he couldn't. \"You never had so much money Harry, in fact you still owe me some, so that means it's all his .\" She put a little too much accent on the word 'his'.\" Harry drew in some air to form an answer, but was cut off by his sister again. \"And what did you tell me that he's doing? Detective? That couldn't give him so much money.\" She stated. Perry was very close to throwing the drinks on the floor, but restrained himself. \"He's private and we are in L.A. Don't ask me why people like to spend so much money on their lost partners and cheating husbands.\" Harry shrugged. \"Better tell me about yourself. How's Jeff?\" Before she had time to answer, Perry knocked on the door and then went in. He set the tray on the table by the window and Chloe spurted for her mug. Perry looked from Rachel to Harry and sighed. \"I have to go. Stakeout.\" He explained and turned to Harry. \"Don't burn the house, don't try to drive my car and don't drown in the sea together with Chloe.\" Harry knew it was just Perry showing his concern and acting like himself, but to stranger like Rachel it might have sounded harsh. Perry could feel the evil look, which she threw in his direction and had to hold himself back instead of telling her to go to hell. He almost kissed Harry good-bye, but caught the movement soon enough. It pissed him off - having to hide his affection. Just for Harry's sake he managed. \"Bye!\" He waved at Chloe, who smiled and waved back. Perry stormed out of the room and went towards the door. \"I'll be right back!\" Harry shouted at his two guests and ran out of the room after Perry. \"Wait!\" He yelled from the porch. Perry was already on the street, but turned back as Harry jogged towards him. \"I'm sorry. I had no idea she would be like this.\" He paused. \"She's really great sis. We had a lot of fun together as kids..\" \"Don't be sorry, it's your sister and no one chooses their family.\" \"I know but still I don't like to see you so pissed.\" Harry whined. \"It's just for two days, isn't it? Then they will leave and everything will be back to normal, right?\" Perry said hopefully. \"Okay. And Perry?\" \"Hmm.\" Harry kissed him gently on the lips. \"Thanks.\" Back in the house he found Chloe on the couch, playing with her Robocop toy. It made him smile. \"Where's mom?\" \"In the kitchen, I think. She's preparing herself some toast.\" Harry went to find Rachel, who was looking through the kitchen cupboards. \"Need help?\" He asked. \"Nope, everything is fine.\" She smiled. \"Harry, I'm really glad to see you again.\" She hugged him tightly. \"Chloe doesn't know anything about your prison past and I'd like to leave it that way, okay?\" Harry nodded. \"Sure.\" \"So tell me now, when she's out of earshot. How it's possible that you haven't call one single time during the last year or so to beg for money or help? And don't tell me everything's changed since you've moved here.\" She gave him a knowing look. \"I'm not sure, okay? Something just must have happened. I'm happy now.\" No. He wouldn't tell her about Perry! Her eyes scrutinized him thoroughly, but she didn't say anything so Harry continued. \"Perry gave me a job, so now I have my own money. Don't look at me that way. It's legal, okay? I don't steal shit anymore.\" He stuttered. \"Yeah, this 'Perry' is also weird. What kind of guy has colored napkins in his kitchen?\" She pointed to the counter. Harry couldn' t help but smiled. \"Perry-kind of guy, I guess.\" \"You like him? Look how he's treating you! I heard what he'd said before he left. All orders.\" That made Harry's brows furrow. He never thought about Perry like this. And since they started 'dating' all Perry's words were sweet to him, no matter what. \"Um, I don't mind him. He's not that bad, really.\" They had to end their discussion, because Chloe came to the kitchen, the Robocop dangling from her little hand. \"Can we go to the beach now? Please!\" Both adults smiled at her. It was Harry, who answered. \"Sure thing, sweetie.\" ~tbc Thanks for reading! I hope to have the next part up in two days! *growls at midterms*[Chapter 3] The afternoon at the beach was wonderful, but it tired Harry out more than he would admit. Chloe insisted on building at least three 'perfect' sandcastles, playing with her ball and many rounds of chasing game. When they got home, both were dead tired and hungry. Chloe ran to her mum and started narrating about her afternoon. However, Harry could sense something bad in the air. Perry was already at home, because his shoes vere neatly put next to the inside doormat, but when Harry came to the living room, he found only Rachel sitting on the couch with his niece on her lap. \"Hi! How was you afternoon?\" Harry asked. \"I went for a walk, but this city is so weird. I'm not even sure why, maybe it's the weather...or people, I don't know.\" She patted Chloe's head and sighed. \"I made some dinner. It's in the kitchen, although I'm not sure if it still is, because when I mentioned it to your 'chief', he only murmured something and left.\" Harry cursed inwardly. He forgot to tell Rachel how anal Perry was about his kitchen...that wasn't good. He sensed that this evening would end badly. \"Don't mind him, he's sometimes a bit moody after stakeout.\" He tried to lighten the situation. \"Whatever, I don't get why are you staying here.\" At this moment Perry showed up. His hair wet from the shower, but instead of the usual dressing gown he wore some casual set of clothes. Always gentleman. He must have heard at least part of their conversation and looked slightly pissed, but that only Harry could tell. \"How was your--\" Harry didn't get to finish his sentence, because Perry stopped him harshly. \"What? Can you tell me why are you wearing your outside shoes in the living room!?\" Fuck! The shoes... Harry averted his gaze and quickly went to put them down, choosing his comfy slippers instead. He could hear Rachel's outburst. \"That's enough, stop treating him like shit, okay? And don't yell in front of my daughter. Harry, you should really consider moving out of this--\" she paused, looking for the right word, \"palace!\" Perry felt anger, but also bunch of other emotions flow over him. He stood there baffled, looking between her and Harry, who didn't react. \"I'm going to sleep.\" Perry said at last and disappeared to the hall, heading towards his room. The room he started sharing with Harry some weeks ago. Back in the living room they heard only a distant click of the door. Chloe looked at her own shoes nervously. \"Is Perry also mad at me? I don't want him to be mad at me. I'm sorry about the shoes.\" She whined. \"It's okay, honey.\" Rachel calmed her. \"You did nothing wrong.\" That seemed to help, because the girl cooled down almost immediately, stood up and fished for a small camera in Harry's pocket. \"Harry, show mom the castle we made.\" She grinned. Rachel sighed, but smiled. \"Okay, show me.\" After putting Chloe in her bed, they ate the dinner which Rachel had made earlier and Harry was trying to clean everything up and to set the kitchen to the previous state. No need to anger Perry more than necessary in the morning. \"Jeff never liked you - I know - but still he could find a work for you and he will if I tell him.\" She started once sitting back on the couch. Harry coughed suddenly, looking shocked. \"But-- Why?\" \"This place is terrible Harry, you should come home. I'll help you with everything if you promise not to steal anymore.\" Rachel put her hand on his shoulder. \"I don't want to! I mean, thanks, but I love my new life here, really...\" And Perry. \"Whatever Harry, just remember that you have us, okay?\" He hugged her. \"Thanks. I think I'm going to sleep, anything you need?\" She shook her head, so Harry started in the direction of Perry's - their - room. He stopped himself in time and went to his old bedroom instead. There was just the bed left and also some crap he didn't need. And it was cold. He really missed Perry behind his back when he crouched under his blanket. Maybe an hour or so later, when Harry was sure that everyone must have been sleeping already, he heard the door open. And then he smelled the too familiar scent. \"Perry?\" Without words, Perry just climbed to the bed and put his hand around Harry's waist possessively. \"Perry! What the hell!?\" That was Harry's rational reaction, but his body seemed to act otherwise. He felt himself harden, just from the gentle grip, which Perry had on his hip. Fuck. \"What are you doing?\" \"I'm sorry I yelled earlier. And I'm also sorry that I hate your sister, but I can't help it.\" Harry chuckled. Perry was cute while being sincere. \"How was your stakeout?\" Harry snuggled closer to him and enjoyed the warm feeling. \"Pff...Tiring and boring. But I'm not bored now.\" He gave Harry's cock a quick squeeze through the boxers and smirked when he felt it harden even more. \"And neither are you.\" He licked Harry's earlobe. \"Unf..Perry! Stop, please! I don't want to--\" He paused and gasped, because Perry moved his hips just the right way so his crotch met Harry's ass. \"Please! I don't want to do this now.\" Perry stopped and let go. That made Harry twirl, but he was glad that Perry's hand was away. \" What ?\" \"I don't want to do...this. Not when they sleep in the next room.\" He rolled over so he could face Perry. \"Please?\" Perry sighed and turned to his back. \"Is it true?\" He said to the ceiling. \"Is what true?\" Harry asked. \"That I treat you like shit and that you should move out.\" \"How--\" \"I heard you talking earlier Harry. I'm not stupid. I know that your sister hates me and she even doesn't know about us--\" He paused. \"Perry, you know I'm happy here, right?\" Harry kissed him deeply. That seemed to drag Perry to his previous plan. He rolled back to his side and started kissing Harry passionately. \"Perry!\" Harry's voice was muffled by the kissing. \"Not now, she might listen--\" \"And what?\" He had no desire to end now. \"Perry!!\" Harry's hands showed him aside, roughly. \"Shit, Harry?\" It sounded startled. \"Not now.\" \"Okay. I know it's your sister, but believe me that I can't fucking wait for her to get out!\" Perry hissed angrily and stormed out of the room. Harry could only hear the bathroom door open and then close shut. Great. He thought. \"Fuck...\" He said to his pillow. It didn't answer. ~tbc[Chapter 4] The next day, Perry was nowhere to be found, but he left a small message for Harry telling that he'd be at work until late in the evening. After all, Harry decided it would be easier this way. The less time Perry and Rachel spend together, the better. They went out for lunch and did a little bit shopping afterwards. In the evening Chloe insisted on going to the beach again. She was running in circles around them and splashing water when the waves licked her feet. \"Harry, I'm glad that you are happy, but still, haven't you changed your mind? Mom would love to see you as well. Come back home with us. This place doesn't suit you.\" He shrugged. What he had here with Perry was important to him, but of course there was something special about his hometown. He'd love to see his mum and other friends again too. Damn. Harry grinned when a big splash of water landed on his back. He forgot his ongoing conversation with Rachel and ran after Chloe to get his revenge. After some extra demanding from Chloe, Rachel took her to the McDonald's, so Harry went home alone. Perry was already here, or at least his car was. \"Perry?\" \"Hey.\" Perry called from his small office located upstairs. Harry climbed the steps. \"Hi.\" \"Where are they?\" Perry asked. \"Stuffing themselves with cheeseburgers I think.\" Harry grinned. \"Um..Can I borrow your car to take them to the airport tomorrow?\" He got only a long sigh as response at first. \"Okay, but promise to give it back in one piece.\" \"Sure, thanks.\" He smiled and stayed in the doorway. What?\" Perry raised his head after few minutes. \"What are you doing?\" Harry blinked. \"Nothing. I'm just...thinking about what Rachel said. Perry's brows furrowed and he motioned to Harry to continue, his heart speeding up. \"I mean, I'm happy here, but my family is far away and I don't like it.\" He paused. \"I'm not sure if-- Forget what I said.\" He added quickly and turned to leave. \"Harry?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Why did she come here. And don't worry, I won't bitch about her anymore. I guess we just don't like each other and that's it.\" Harry thought for a while. \"To visit me? Chloe also wanted to see me--\" He paused and Perry stayed silent. \"I think she wanted to check on me.\" Perry's frown deepened. But Harry continued. \"You know, it's not hard to imagine me being the black sheep of the family. And back in Embrey she could keep an eye on me. But then I moved to NY and that were the worst times. She saved my ass more than once and lend me some money. You know the rest. Last year, things changed...I met you.\" Harry smiled faintly. \"I guess she's just suspicious.\" \"What are you going to tell her?\" \"I--\" They heard shuffling from downstairs. \"Sorry, have to go.\" Harry turned and left, leaving Perry alone with unpleasant thoughts. The evening was quiet. Perry was tired and pissed at Rachel from the previous night, so he stayed upstairs and there was no yelling. After playing another table game with Chloe, Harry joined Rachel in front of the TV. They could hear the clatter of the computer keyboard from the office. Perry was still working. \"I'm really glad you visited.\" \"Yeah.\" \"When's your plane taking off?\" \"10.45.\" \"Okay, I'm taking you to the airport. Chloe will love Perry's car.\" Harry grinned. \"Did you think about what I said?\" Rachel asked for the last time. \"Uh-huh.\" \"And what are you going to do?\" Chloe chose that moment to emerge from the guest room. \"Uncle Harry? Will you tell me a scary story like you always did?\" She pleaded. Harry smiled and nodded. \"Wait for me in the bed, 'kay?\" She winked at him and ran away. Harry looked at Rachel. \"Do you think it's still possible to book the plane tickets?\" ~tbc Thanks for reading![Chapter 5] When Perry got up next morning, the whole house was already on feet. The empty bed next to him made him sad, but it was just for tonight, so he could deal with it. There was a big bag and Chloe's little backpack near the door and he could hear laughter from the kitchen. But there was another bag standing near, which he recognized. It belonged to Harry. Perry felt his heart beat faster again. He made his way towards the kitchen. \" 'Morning.\" He greeted, but it was far from optimistic. \"Harry? Is that your bag near the door?\" He asked carefully and ignored Rachel's eye-roll. \"Uncle Harry is coming back with us!\" Chloe informed him proudly before Harry could say anything. Perry gaped, not sure what to say. Then it hit him and he stormed out of the room rather quickly, feeling miserable. Harry was leaving him... \"Perry! Wait!\" Harry ran after him and grabbed his shoulder. \"Perry!!\" Finally, Perry stopped in his tracks, but didn't turn around. \"She's just a child, don't take her seriously.\" \"You are not coming back to me, are you? \"What?\" There was no answer. \"Perry, what's wrong?\" \"I love you, that's fucking wrong! And now you are going back home .\" Perry had told the magic l-word to Harry more than once in the past, but now it felt much deeper and real. Harry smiled and turned Perry around so he could hug him tightly and bury his face in Perry's chest. \"I went to tell you in the night, but you were already fast asleep. I'm not leaving, okay?\" \"But she said...\" \"I decided to go with them, but just for a few days. I forgot how good it felt to be at home and eat my mum's cake and I must make sure that I still win at cards with Jeff, no matter how hard he tries or cheats.\" Somewhere in the middle of his speech, Perry started hugging him back. \"You idiot, to scare me like that...\" Harry leaned in to kiss Perry and they both forgot that Rachel and Chloe were still in the house. \"What? You guys are together?\" Rachel sounded shocked, but not pissed. Harry jumped - surprised - and teared quickly away from Perry. \"Really Harry, you could have told me.\" She remarked. Both men were staring at her in disbelief. Harry recovered first. \"You...you don't mind?\" She grinned and rolled her eyes. \"And why would I? You've never been good with women Harry, maybe this is the reason why.\" This time it was Perry, who laughed. And Rachel continued. \"I guess it explains a few things. Also, I now get why are you two living together and why is Harry so happy.\" The last statement made Perry warm inside. Maybe she wasn't so bad after all... After more explaining and hugging, the girls left them alone for a while and went to the car. Harry kissed Perry gently, before grabbing his bag. \"I'll come back, don't worry.\" Perry grinned. \"Okay, but it's you who should worry--\" He kissed Harry in return. \"--because the first thing I'll do when you are here is making you pay for all the lonely nights.\" END Well, the original prompter wanted happy ending - here you have it !

They sang as the old bus jumped on the dirt road. \"Ha-ha do you think the talent scout will pick us for the Grand Old Opry Daddy?\" Asked a little girl with her brown hair pulled up in a red bow. She had on a white tank top and a denim skirt and cowgirl boots. \"I dunno Chennai, who knows?\" The band leader said. He had brown hair and wore a red worn bandana and a light brown western shirt and some worn denim jeans and boots. \"Oh, Well there's not a better group of singers than the singin strays!\" Said a little boy with reddish brown hair. He had a black bandana and a sandy orange western shirt and some black jeans and boots. \"Well I think we have a good group of supporters eh Cash?\" Asked a woman with reddish orange hair with a black bow in the back keeping the wavy locks out of her face, she had amber eyes as well, and a black tank top and orange skirt with a fancy pair of boots. Her question was directed at her husband, friend, boss, and the leader of the singing strays. The bus stopped behind a barn in the fairgrounds. Lyle opened the doors to the bus and the group piled out. \"We're gonna go rehearse ya'll can watch or you can go on the rides ok?\" Cash said handing Chennai some money which she stuffed in her pocket. \"I wanna watch!\" Said the little boy with reddish brown hair. \"Yeah! I wanna watch with Austin!\" Said a little girl with reddish orange hair and a black bow. \"Alright just be quite ok Austin, Texas?\" The woman with amber eyes said. The five-year-old and four-year-old siblings nodded and ran into the barn house. \"We're gonna go ride some rides momma!\" Chennai said running off with her four-year-old brother. Austin and Texas sat listening to their parents sing in the barn. Two boys poked their heads in right as their parents went from practicing notes to the words in their song. \"Ooh-ooh-ooh We're in harmony We're in harmony.\" They carried the last note and Cash said. \"Voice like an angel with looks to match.\" \"Oh, please.\" The old lady singer in the band said rolling her eyes. \"We're in harmon-oh-ooh! Aaah.\" Dixie said as she stepped back on a board which hit her in the backside causing her to fall on her face. \"Ooooo.\" Everyone said looking away with a look of pain. \"Oh, my poor,\" Dixie said getting up and rubbing her behind. She flipped her hair behind her shoulder and said. \"Darn this one horse two bit three timin' fair!\" \"Heh-heh now Dixie it ain't like it smacked your singin end, now can we get back to rehearsin please?\" Cash chuckled. \"I refuse to work under these conditions!\" Dixie said turning away from the charming cowboy. \"Uh-oh here we go.\" The elderly lady said. \"Well I tell you what Dixie, You, rehearse and afterwards I'll give that piece of wood a good old talkin' too, alright?\" Cash said. \"I got twenty dollars on Dixie.\" Said a young man with a green tee shirt. \"Ha I'll cover that.\" His brother said. \"Ugh it just so happens I am a professional! And my standards...\" Dixie said stepping in front of Cash. \"Oh, now Dixie darlin you put on the same old record everyday ain't it just about worn out by now?\" \"You have some nerve talkin to me that way Cash. If your ears were anymore tin you could can beans with 'em!\" Dixie spat. \"Now you listen here miss fancy hair, in a couple of days we will be in front of that talent scout from the Grand Old Opry.\" Cash said with a grin. \"Ugh I get possibly maimed for life and all you can think about is the 'Grand Old Opry'!\" Dixie snapped at Cash and walked away. \"Oh, now Dixie...\" Cash groaned. \"I'll be in my trailer.\" Dixie said flipping her hair in Cash's face. \"Darlin we got a show to do you can't just walk...\" Cash began but Dixie was already outside. \"Away...\" The two boys traded the money they bet on who would win and Cash just said on a crate and ran his hands through his hair. \"Sometimes I dislike that woman.\" \"Huh if they disliked each other anymore they'd have to get re-hitched!\" The elder laughed making the boys chuckle. Lyle ran in with his banjo muttering something about how this would be the worst show ever and ducked under the curtain behind the stage. \"But Cash who's gonna sing Dixie's part?\" Asked the boy with a Green Tee shirt. \"Just-Just give me a second.\" Cash said. \"I do a pretty good Dixie, Cash!\" Said the boy with the Red shirt. \"Waylon somehow I don't picture you doing Dixie's part.\" Cash said rubbing his temples. They all began to talk over one another. Cliff hanger! there's gonna be alot of these people so get used to it! Now I want to hear what you guys think once this thing ends, if you think I should do more on this you'll get more! so till the next chapter my readers XOXO Fanfic girl of all worlds signing off ;)[Chapter 2] (Somewhere else in the fairgrounds) \"Come on, hurry up Cj we're gonna be late for the show! And we don't wanna miss mom and dad singin!\" Chennai said as her young brother tried to keep up. Chennai and Austin were twins and one year older than Cash Junior or 'Cj' as he preferred to be called, and Texas. The girls wore bows like their mother, Chennai's was red and Texas had a black one like her mother. And the boys wore bandana's like their father, Cj's was red like his fathers and Austin wore a black one. Chennai had on a white tank top and a denim skirt and cowgirl boots and her hair was light brown. Austin had hair like his mothers, Reddish-orangish-brown with a black bandana and an orange western shirt a brown vest and some jeans. Cj had brown hair like his father but just a bit darker he had a blue tee shirt and denim jeans and a red bandana. Texas had an orange tee shirt and a brown zip up hoodie with jean shorts and a black bow in her hair. (Back in the Barn) Austin and Texas were making their way inside of the barn so they could watch their parents sing. \"SIT!\" Cash yelled making everyone it on a crate that they had been sitting on. \"Ok... Here's the good news, Granny rose you'll be singin Dixie's part.\" Cash said pointing to the old woman. \"Me?!\" Granny rose said with wide eyes. \"Oh, she gonna love this one...\" Cash mumbled as the curtain went up. Lyle began playing his banjo as the group began to hum along with the song. The two boys who came back to watch pushed over each other as did Chennai, Austin, Cj, and Texas did. \" Like the sun and blue skies, like summer nights and fireflies \" Cash sang. \" Like an Itch, \" The boy who had on a green shirt sang the Waylon joined him. \" And a scratch! \" \" We're a perfect match \" Granny rose sang but the last part was interrupted by a belch in Cash's face. \" Cause we're in harmony \" The whole group sang. \" Like a tick and a flea, Like a bird and a bee, Like a nose and a tail, a horse and a trail, a pond and a frog, and a bump and a log \" \" We're hand and glove an example ,\" Granny sang \" Of \" Waylon and his brother sang \" Of \" Cash continued \" Of! \" Granny rose sang but her note was very off key. \" Ooh-ooh-ooh! \" one of the young boys who had watched sang. Cash picked him up and sat him on the stage next to the group. \"Come on kid sing with us!\" He said with a grin. \" Pure bred \" Cash sang then the whole group chimed in. \" Down home true sweet \" They all looked at the boy. \" Harmony \" He sang right on key. \" Every crowd we face \" Cash sang. \" Every squirrel we chase \" The kid sang along. \"Ha-ha\" Cash chuckled. \" Anytime any place \" The kid and Cash sang together. (outside the barn) Dixie walked back to the bus when she heard the song and bobbed her head to the music till she realized it was her song being sung. \"What.\" Dixie murmured turning back to the barn. (Back inside) \" Listen up you'll see \" Cash and the young boy sang in time. \" we're in harmony \" Granny, the green shirted boy, and Waylon sang. \" Listen to our melody, together you and me \" Cash and the Boy sang as the crowd went wild. \" Cause we're in harmony ooh-ooh-ooh \" The whole group sang. \" ooh-oooh-ooh-ooooh! \" The kid sang. \"Ha-ha-ha yeah!\" Cash said. They all bowed and Granny said. \"Hot dog, listen to 'em Cash they loved that number!\" \"Yeah if a cow had wheels it'd be a milk truck. That song is hokey, Their clappin for this little kid here.\" He chuckled. \"Yeah the kids cute alright!\" She said as the curtain closed. So that happened, let me know what you guys think?

So let's carry on with the chapter! They all chuckled as they made their way back to the bus for lunch. \"Say kid what's your name?\" Cash asked the young boy. \"Copper!\" He said. \"Well Copper, Thanks for getting us out of a tight spot.\" Cash said with a grin. Copper laughed and said. \"It was fun!\" \"You got a future in show business kid, you come back and see us in a few years.\" Cash said walking out of the barn. \"Yep, in a couple a years.\" Waylon said and then his brother continued. \"Yep cause bein' in a band takes maturity.\" Waylon just looked at his brother and gave him a glare. Cash, Waylon and his brother were making their way back to the bus when Dixie stepped in front of them and by the look on her face she was far from happy. \"Just what'd ya think yer doin?\" She asked with a falsetto. \"Just a little audience participation. That kid wowed 'em!\" Cash said with a huge grin. \"I wonder if got Chennai up there or maybe Cj to pull him out of this one?\" Dixie thought but didn't let it show, but her hopes were still high for her two singing children. \"Kid? What kid?\" She asked. \"Bye Mr. Cash!\" Copper yelled as he ran off with his friend. \"Ha-ha-ha That kid!\" He said gesturing towards the direction Copper ran off. \"Little kid was heaven sent!\" Granny rose said with a smile. \"That sang my lead?\" Dixie asked her voice hinting her anger. \"Oh-no he didn't just sing it... He SANG it!\" Cash said with a chuckle. \"You don't mean to tell me that, that wet behind the ears kid could ever take my place in the band?\" She asked. \"Oh, I didn't say that but...\" Cash paused looking away from Dixie and putting his thumbs in his pockets. \"He does have that refreshin bloomin youth about him.\" \"Just what exactly are you sayin.\" Dixie gasped and scowled at the cowboy. \"Well what do you think I'm sayin?\" He asked, she just growled. \"You better not be saying what I think your sayin!\" \"I think you know what you think I'm sayin!\" Cash said back as Waylon and his Brother made their bets on who would win this fight. \"Then what you sayin had better not be what I think yer sayin!\" Dixie said in Cash's face. \"Why do you always have...\" He said back and the argument took off. \"Only because you...\" They began talking over one another. \"You know this is just like the time...\" Cash growled at the Diva. \"Ack-jaaa-cc-Fsk You better not bring that up!\" She said looking dead straight into his eyes. Cash just stepped back as Dixie gave him a glare that would melt butter, she was so mad. \"Oh, I think we've both been perfectly clear.\" Cash said with sarcasm. \"Oh, perfectly...\" Dixie rolled the words on her tongue. \"I QUIT!\" She yelled at him before marching off and Slamming the door on the bus. The rest of the band began talking over one another about who would replace Dixie. Cash put his hands over his ears then yelled. \"SIT!\" and they all stood perfectly still. \"I'll take care of this...\" He said looking sternly at the band. \"I'd better that talent scout could be here any minute.\" Cash carefully walked up to the bus and said. \"Oh, Dixie you ain't mad about a little joshin are ya?\" The doors opened when Dixie kicked the handle by the steering wheel. She was sitting in the front seat. \"I was only teasing, you know how I feel about ya...\" He said with a dashing smile. \"Yeah, you have a lousy way of showin it!\" She said closing the door. Cash blew air out his lips and said trying to keep cool. \"I am trying to kiss and make up here. Now won't you please accept my apology?\" The doors opened and she yelled. \"BLOW IT OUT YER EAR!\" Before closing the door once again. \"Ok you Diva, but I'm in charge of this band and ain't nobody is indispensable.\" He said as she opened the door yet again. \"You're in charge?\" She asked chuckling. \"Which one of us is in the driver's seat?\" \"Now listen you!\" He yelled at her just as she slammed the doors in his face. Nearly missing his nose. \"Now you've got me riled!\" He said with a frown. oooo so what will happen in the next chapter. if you've watched the movie well you have an idea what might happen but there will be the diference of humans, Chennai, Austin, Cash junior, and Texas. XOXO Fanfic girl of all worlds signing off stay frosty![Chapter 4] Copper and his friend were riding the merry-go-round. His friend was laughing and Copper was trying not to puke. \"Most fun ever!\" The other boy with red hair said.\"Second most fun ever.\" Cash said. The ride went around once again and Cash ran with it. \"Mr. Cash!\" Copper said. \"Listen kid, you looked blissful when you were up on stage. It had to be the most fun you've ever had.\" Cash said barely keeping up with the ride. \"Oh, yeah it was great!\" Copper said with a huge smile. \"Well we can't let nothin get in the way of that, now can we?\" Cash asked as he ran into a barrel. Cash jumped onto the ride and held onto the horse and chuckled. \"Now as I was sayin. How'd you like to join the band?\" \"Really?\" Copper asked and Cash continued. \"Yes, sir a genuine singin stray. What'd say?\" \"YEAH!\" Copper said then his friend asked. \"But Copper we were gonna have some more fun.\" \"Well, Tod can be in the band too, right?\" Copper said. \"He's my best friend.\" Cash stammered and looked to the red-haired boy. \"Can you sing kid?\" \"Course he can sing! Show 'em Tod!\" Copper said. \"We're in HAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRR!\" Tod sang but it was way off key. The man who was running the ride shut it down launching them off. \"Hoo-hoo, here's the good news, you're gonna be part of the entourage-y!\" Cash said. \"What's that?\" Tod asked tilting his head. \"That's French. Means you get to hang out with our new Star here and keep him happy... and wash bowls and stuff.\" Cash said. \"Well he does that already!\" Copper laughed. The two boys ran outside the bus door and Cash wasn't too far behind them. \"Oh-ho Cash,\" Dixie said opening the door. \"Oh, hey Dixie.\" Cash said walking away, Dixie hopped off the chair and walked to the door. \"You've come crawling back.\" \"Oh, by the way you can't quit you're fired!\" He said walking away for lunch. \"UH? WHAT!? You can't fire me I already quit! Cash you get back here...!\" The doors swung closed hitting her in the face. \"Now you've got me riled...\" She growled. so Dixie has been fired but I thought she quit? Oh well who knows how the fifth chapter will go, wait if you're reading this you probaly know how this movie goes! Fanfic girl of all world singing off, stay frosty![Chapter 5] Cash let out a chuckle as he heard thing smash inside. \"Ah, don't get your shirt in a bunch Dix.\" Dixie's friend and entourage Zelda said fixing a bow. \"The nerve of that Cash!\" Dixie said pushing some music notes to the floor. \"Where does he get off firing ME?\" \"Hmm I thought you quit.\" Zelda said picking up some of the mess Dixie had made. \"I'm that man's heart and soul! It's as plain as a pig on a sofa.\" She grumbled flopping down on the couch. \"That Cash can talk a girl out a shoe shack. He talked me into gettin sweet on him and now he tosses me away like yesterday's corn bread!\" She said ripping the poster for the band. \"Honey I don't blame you for feeling hurt.\" \"Hurt? What'd you mean by that do you think Cash could hurt me?\" Dixie chuckled. Zelda just raised an eyebrow at the emotional Singer. Dixie looked at the picture and frowned. She took a piece of tape and put it back up. \"Mangy man...\" She murmured and looked over at the picture across the table of her Husband and their children when they were born. She and Zelda looked outside to see the kids playing with Waylon and his Brother. \"Well there's more than one way to skin a cat.\" Dixie said with a smirk. Zelda just cleared her throat and Dixie shrugged. \"No offence.\" (outside) \"Soups on!\" Lyle said serving everyone lunch of hot dogs and hamburgers. \"You know if I could just play better we'd all be eatin steak. Hey, I should go practice!\" \"Welcome to the band kid, Lemme do some interdictions. That there is Waylon and Floyd, they're the brains of the bunch.\" Cash pointed to the twin young men, Waylon had on a red Tee shirt and denim jeans as well as some boots. Floyd had a Green Tee shirt with pockets and pants and boots that matched his brothers. \"Ugh, why I put up with this low-class crew is beyond me.\" Granny rose grumbled then let out a burp. Then Cash went on. \"Uh and that delicate flower over there is Granny rose... Textbook version of growing old gracefully...\" \"Oooh I got me an itch!\" She said scratching her bum. Granny rose wore a pair of rain boots and old overalls over an old blue tee shirt and a rose shawl over her shoulders. And a Rose bandana over her grey blonde hair which was pulled up in a bun, her bangs hung over her eyes. \"Yep you'll never harmonize with a finer group of singin strays.\" Cj said mouthful of food so he sounded like his dad a bit. After lunch Copper, Tod, Texas, and Austin were chasing crickets. \"Alright ten minutes till curtain, let's round 'em up and move 'em out.\" Cash said walking into the barn. Dixie scowled at Cash as he walked into the barn. \"That means you Copper!\" Cash said as Copper ran after the group and cricket. \"Say Tod while were on why don't you spiff up those bowls a bit.\" Cash said and Tod nodded. \"Don't forget Copper, Fireworks smack at sundown!\" Austin and Texas nodded so did Copper as he ran into the barn. hmmm fireworks what will happen? I guess we'll have to wait another week find out. Fanfic girl of all worlds signing off Keep cool![Chapter 6] Dixie opened the doors to the bus and said. \"Psst little darlin, cone on in Dixie wants to talk to ya.\" \"But I'm supposed to sing now...\" Copper said. \"Oh, I know I know I just want to pass along my secret to success...\" Dixie lied but smile all the while. \"Before each show take a big old helpin of that.\" She pointed to a large jar of peanut butter. \"Wow thanks miss Dixie!\" Copper said \"mee-mee-mee-mee-mee!\" Dixie sang walking to the barn. \"Whoof-whoof-whoof-whoof-whoof!\" (The barn) \"Uh-oh bad news in rhinestone boots...\" Granny said after Dixie stepped inside the barn with a smirk. \"Oh-oh-ho, why Cash you look as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs!\" Dixie chuckled as she ran a hand under Cash's chin. \"Well I'm as busy as a farmer with one hoe and two rattle snakes!\" He said and Dixie just made or tried to make a comeback. \"Oh, yeah! Well I'm as...as... Oh, I got nothin...\" \"What is it Dixie?\" Cash asked. \"Well I just thought you could use a lead singer.\" She said batting her eyelashes at him. (The bus) \"Copper but you're supposed to sing!\" Todd said as he looked at his friend who had peanut butter stuck to his teeth. \"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\" Zelda laughed for the chair. So much so in fact that she almost fell off. Tod picked up the large jar and threw it at the woman. It stuck to her head and she stumbled around trying to get the jar off. \"Oh, hold on Copper I'll be right back.\" And just like that Tod ran off to help his friend. \"Here Copper!\" Tod said handing his friend a bucket of fresh milk. Copper drank it down and ran into the barn. \"You know darn well Copper is our new!\" Cash said but Dixie cut him off. \"Copper? You mean that little kid? Why him and that red-head friend of his like a bank robber on roller skates.\" She chuckled nervously hoping Cash wouldn't see through her plan. \"You're kiddin?\" Cash asked not fully believing her. \"If I am may my hair loose its natural luster.\" She said.(the bus) \"Get used to it 'Entourage'.\" Zelda said as she tried to get the jar from her head but only got more of its contents in her hair and on her hands. Hey Zelda try shampoo! and if that don't work \"rinse, lather and repeat! Rinse lather and repeat!\"-Reggie rooster-from racing stripes Ok so how will the next week what is gonna happen and what will they all do? Fanfic girl of all worlds signing off see ya'll next week![Chapter 7] Sorry for the late update but here it is! I know it took two weeks and a day but it's here! PLZ enjoy and R/R \"Here I am!\" Copper said as he tripped on his shoe laces. \"Hmph run off eh?\" Cash asked Dixie who wore a look of shock on her face. She looked to the door to see Zelda with the jar on her head. \"Sorry, Dix...\" Zelda said. Cash smelled Copper's breath and looked at his wife and growled. \"Oh-ho Dixie you are through!\" \"Well getting rid of me ain't gonna be so easy Cash!\" She said flipping her hair in his face. She walked off with a swing in her hips but she stepped on the board that had hit her in the rear just that morning launching her like a cannon ball at Zelda. \"That looked easy.\" Waylon said. \"Remind me to give that piece of wood a bonus!\" Cash whispered to Granny rose. \"Waylon give me a back beat?\" Cash said. \"We are heading for the big time and I got a big-time song to take us there!\" \"You were headin for the pound dog! No one wanted you around dog! Now you're gonna be a found dog you'll be a hound dude! Aroo-roo-roo You'll be a hound dude yeah watch out! The whole world is gonna know you! And they'll be fallin at your paws soon! So, bark it up all you want too You'll be a hound dude! Aroo-roo-roo We're all hound dudes the big dogs now! Once we were lonely pups with nothin but our dreams! Now we can strut our stuff while the fans all howl and scream!\" \"Oh, Cash I'm supposed to meet Texas, Austin, and Tod for the fireworks soon!\" Copper said. \"Dad'll be here any minute!\" Chennai said as her and her younger brother waited to ride the Ferris wheel with their father. \"No-no we can't let anybody hold us back remember, we're hound dudes!\" Cash said as he and Copper ran toward the Ferris wheel. \"No more small-town dog Take life down dog No more bein just a hound dog You're a hound dude Oh, goodbye leash I'm a hound dude No collar for me we're all hound dudes Happy as a flee we're all hound dudes On top of the world can't you see We're all hound dudes!\" The fireworks went off and Chennai, Cj, Texas, Austin and Tod just watched their friend break a promise because of someone else. (The bus) Dixie watched the fireworks go off recalling the first time her and Cash kissed. She had been scared and he somehow convinced her to go with him on the Ferris wheel one of her biggest fears, and after they got halfway up she had screamed but he silence her with a kiss. Just then Chennai, Austin, Cj and, Texas walked into the bus with sad looks on their faces. They went to another room of the bus and changed from clothing to pajama's. Chennai had on a tank to with matching shorts with little horses on them. Austin had on a black pj shirt and bottoms with checks. Cj had on pj's like his brothers but without the checks, his had a western singer on it. Texas's a black tank top and red sweat pants. \"What's the matter darlin's?\" Dixie asked them as they climbed into their bed near the back of the bus. \"Nothin Mama...\" Austin said holding his stuffed saluki dog toy. \"No, what happened Hun?\" Dixie asked sitting on the edge of the bed brushing some of Chennai's hair behind her ear. \"Daddy forgot 'bout us...\" Chennai mumbled, her and her father had always been close and she was hurt by the fact he forgot his promise to them. \"I doubt he forgot, he just got preoccupied...\" Dixie growled the last part. \"Nah, he didn't even stop when we tried to stop him he was too busy with Copper!\" Cj growled. \"He was bad enough before with the band and now he's got a now he's got a new little buddy...\" \"Even though you practiced same as him Mama you always had time for us even durin rehearsal you'd stop for us...\" Texas murmured she was the tough one but it was only an act. \"Oh, little Darlin's your dad can be a little busy with the band but he still loves ya'll even if he don't show it...\" Dixie said as she tucked them in. Hmmm so the kids feel as if Cash has dissertated them. And Dixie has a fear of Ferris wheels? I hope you enjoy this chapter and the next! also please forgive me but I wanted to finish this wonderful chapter. Fanfic girl of all worlds signing off. Stay frosty and please R/R[Chapter 8] A little while later Dixie sat on a chair eating cookies. Zelda took the bowl from in front of her and put her hands over it. \"Why eat 'em Dix may as well slap them right on your hips.\" She said. \"Oh, come on Zelda I need a drink...\" Dixie said. Her and Zelda walked out of the bus to where Tod was cleaning bowls and cups. \"Give me one straight...\" Dixie said. Tod slid a bowl with cookies and a cup with water towards her. She looked at the cookies with a smile but Zelda took the bowl from her and gave her a look saying she didn't need them and mumbled. \"Give me that.\" Dixie looked in her water for a sign if she was lucky, but it just settled. She saw Tod's reflection in it and looked up at him with a sympathetic look. \"Oh, darlin' you look like somthin the cat dragged in.\" Zelda cleared her throat and Dixie said. \"Oh, no offence.\" Zelda only took a bite out of a cookie. \"What'd you care?\" Tod asked with arms crossed. \"Oh, come on Tod we're both in the same old briar patch now cast off by the one we care about the most...\" Said Dixie with a frown. \"Guess you know how that feels.\" \"Copper's forgotten allabout me...\" Said Tod. \"Mm I heard that. Hurts worse than anything...\" Dixie said. \"Yeah, I remember this one guy named Leroy...\" Zelda began but Dixie cut her off. \"I'm talkin' to the kid, Ya see Tod relationships and show business they just don't mix. Oh, it starts out nice and friendly till they get that first taste of fame and it's look out for number one!\" Dixie said. \"ooooh-oooh-ooh-ooh First, they tell you that you're gonna be the next big thing They put roses in your dressin room every time ya sing Till you ask for a little consideration Then they call you a diva, pink slip, termination They grab the next yapper just walkin down the street They got him singin your song marking your tree It's lonely at the top When the lights go down and the cheerin stops You got no real friends, no place to call home It's all good doggy, and no bone And the next thing you know he ain't bringin You roses it's all cold stares cold shoulders\" \"Cold noses.\" Zelda said. \"He doesn't write doesn't call doesn't howl your name All that he can think about is fortune and fame There ain't nothin I can do to turn his head and excite him Sometimes I swear I just wanna bite him! It's lonely at the top When the light go down and the cheerin stops You got no real friends and no place to call home It's all good doggy good doggy, good doggy good, good doggy No bone no-no-no! Good doggy no bone Good doggy no bone Good doggy and no bone Good doggy no bone Good doggy no bone Good doggy no bane Good doggy no bone Good doggy no bone good doggy no bone Not even a little bitty bone Good doggy and no bo-o-o-one! And no Bone! Haha now that's a good little doggy\" \"And Copper wouldn't even be in that dumb old band if I hadn't lied for him...\" Tod said. \"Come again?\" Dixie asked him. \"I got Cash to think he doesn't have a home, He does! He lives just down the road a piece.\" \"Little darlin all our troubles are over!\" Dixie said bring Tod closer to her to tell him her plan to get her back in the spot light and for him to get his friend back. \"But how?\" He asked her, she then said. \"Heh-heh-heh just listen close to old Dixie here.\" (The barn) Cash had been practicing with the band the whole night and they were starting to get tired. And his temper was getting out of hand. Gee Depressed Dixie and Cash's temper is acting up. what will happen next week? I guess we'll have to see won't we! R/R pwetty pweeze? Fanfic girl of all worlds signing off till next week! Stay frosty![Chapter 9] New chapter yay! He walked out and stared at the poster for the singin strays. \"Cash have you seen Tod I can't find him.\" Copper said standing next to Cash. \"Nope, Dixie ain't around either.\" He said. \"You were looking for her?\" Copper asked Cash. He just shook his head. \"No, Well I remember when I first met her, I was just like you.\" \"You?\" Copper asked. \"Yep then one night we went a sing on a full moon and I found out we could sing. And I said, 'Dixie this is our ticket to success, we are gonna be stars!' I guess I'd be stretchin if I said I didn't want her around sometimes. But hey we're a couple of hound dudes we don't need old friends holding us back.\" Cash said. The next morning Texas woke up and stretched careful not to wake up her siblings or her Aunt Zelda... \"Where's mom?\" She thought as she walked out of the bus. She had on a pair of jeans and a black western shirt with white and grey checks and inside some were horses or horse shoes and her black boots. She had done her best to pull up her hair but it wasn't perfect. She looked inside the barn but all she saw was the band practicing. There was no sign of her mother all over the fairgrounds. (Near Tod's house) Dixie grumbled as she fallowed Tod through the woods to Copper's house, \"Oh, my hair!\" She said as she pulled it free from a branch. Tod and her ducked into a bush and when they popped out Dixie and a crown of leaves and twigs on her head. \"Ugh...\" She said. After a while they came to Amos Slade's house where Copper lived. \"Nice place could use a woman's touch.\" She said and Tod did his work to get Amos to fallow them. (The fair) Somehow someone threw a dart and it hit a cow causing a stampede. \"AAAAAAAAHHH!\" Screamed Dixie ran away from the cows but cows don't stay in a group during a stampede. Cash was getting ready to sing in front of the talent scout. \"You'll do fine Daddy!\" Chennai of the cows kicked the handle that controlled the Ferris wheel. It went to max speed! It came undone from the base and was tearing through the fair. As Dixie was running from the cows she got caught in the Ferris wheel. \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\" Dixie screamed as she was whisked away by the rouge ride. The band began to play as the Talent scout came into the barn. The Ferris wheel tore through the fair and was right in line with the barn. Texas peeked out of the barn and saw the Ferris wheel coming toward the barn but before she could tell anyone it burst through the barn. Dixie's booth came to a stop right in front of Cash. Their noses touched. \"Dixie what have you done?!\" Cash asked turning away from her and to the crowd. The talent scout got in his car and left. Cash just watched as his dream was crushed. Dixie ran after the car but he was too far off. It began raining. Texas looked to her father and then mother who both looked lost in thought. \"Oh no...\" She thought as they walked away. Dixie walked around the fair seeing all that had been done. She knew the band was through. Dixie sniffed back a few tears as she walked away from Waylon, Floyd, Lyle, and Granny rose. Cash sat in front of a poster for the band and watched it fall to the ground. Dixie just watch him go from hopeful to hopeless all because she was jealous. (the bus) Texas and her siblings sat in the bus dripping wet when Dixie walked in looking like a drowned rat. Austin ran up and hugged her leg tightly. She gently stroked his hair and picked him up then set him on a chair near the table. No words were exchanged since there was no need. Dixie came out in a dry pair of jeans and tank top. She held some towels in her hands and began gently drying off her children one at a time. Once all of them were dried and in bed, Dixie walked to Coppers house to apologize to him. (Copper's house) She was soaked to the bone once again when she walked over to him. \"Dixie?\" Copper asked. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I-I-I just thought you should know blowing your cover was my idea not Tod's...\" Dixie said sadly and continued. \"I guess I just lost sight of what's really important. And Darlin I'm awfully sorry... He never wanted to hurt you, he just wanted you to be his friend again.\" Dixie said her frown and sorrow growing with each word. \"Well... That's what I came to say...\" Dixie said as she walked off. (Tod's house) Texas ran with her siblings to try and get the band back together with the help of Copper and Tod, and it was the best idea they could come up with. \"Ok you get the scout and we'll get the band.\" Tod said as they split into groups. Chennai ran with Tod to get the band, Austin and Texas ran to go get Dixie, Cj and Copper ran off to find the talent scout. So they're gonna get the band back together? yeah! bout time! thanks to those of you who have read this even tho no one has R/R yet Plz I need to know if you like this just please! Fanfic girl of all worlds sadly signing off... keep it frosty ok?[Chapter 10] (with Chennai's group) Cash sat in front of the bus as Lyle tried to fix the old bus. After the band fell apart so did his world it seemed. \"Dixie's gone so are the kids, the bands no more...\" Cash thought sadly. \"Cash...Cash!-Dad...Dad!\" Tod and Chennai yelled running to the bus. \"Dixie's in trouble!-Mom's in trouble!\" The band piled out and began talking over one another about how she was. \"SIT!\" Cash yelled quickly then said. \"Where is she?!\" \"Fallow us!\" The two kids said running off. (with Austin's group) The two kids ran down a road in hopes of finding their mother, but chances slimmed the longer it took them. \"Mom!\" They yelled when they saw her sitting on a bench at a bus stop. \"Huh?\" She said turning around. \"It's the band, their, in trouble!\" They chorused with worried looks. \"Was momma gonna walk off on us?\" Austin thought as they ran off with their mother to the band. (With Chennai's group) \"Well? Where is she?\" Cash asked as they came to a fork in the road. \"Um...\" Tod said. \"AAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" Cj sang a high note to let them know where to go.\"That-a way!\" Chennai said pointing to where her younger brother's call came from. \"Come on everyone fallow me!\" Cash said and then the rest of the group fallowed. (The diner where the scout was.) \"Cj... Copper where's Dixie?\" Cash asked out of breath. \"She'll be along!\" The two boys said leaning against the Scouts car. \"Cash!\" Dixie called out of breath once she saw him. \"Way to go guys!\" Tod said to the rest of the group when he saw them. \"Cash are you alright?\" Asked Dixie worriedly. \"No-no are you alright!?\" Cash asked her, taking hold of her shoulders and gazing into her brown eyes. \"I'm Fine.\" They said together. \"What in tarnation? I thought you were in trouble!\" Cash said. The kids just smiled wide that their plan worked. \"Just exactly why did get us all together?\" He said roughly. \"Because-because that's how it oughta be.\" Copper said. \"Like the words in the song!\" Texas said happily. \"Like the sun.\" Cj said then Chennai finished his thought. \"And blue skies!\" \"Um...\" Austin said trying to continue. \"Like summer nights and fireflies.\" Granny rose said with a grin. \"Like an itch!\" Floyd said then Waylon continued. \"And a scratch!\" \"Well ain't somebody gonna sing!\" Granny rose asked the group. \"We're the perfect match\" Dixie sang walking up to Cash and taking hold of his hand. \"Cause we're in harmony~\" Her and Cash sang together. He pulled her into a hug. She rested her head on his shoulder. They all climbed onto the porch outside the diner and then the whole group sang. \"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh-ooh oooh-ooh-ooh-oooh-hoo\" The talent scout walked out and listened to them. The smile on the kids' faces was ginormous. \"Like a rhyme in a song we all belong Like a bird and a tree, we were meant to be Like a nose and a tail A horse and a trail Like a base and a fiddle A laugh and a riddle A pond and a frog A bump and a log\" The band had to stop to catch their breath. Thankfully Dixie caught hers. \"We're a hand and glove an example of~\" Dixie sang then the rest of group harmonized along with her. \"Ho-o-o-o-me~~~~~\" Dixie sang looking at Cash with love filled eyes. \"Gosh I missed you.\" Cash said giving her a kiss on the cheek. \"Pure bred down home\" The band sang then Chennai, Austin, Copper, Cj, and Texas joined in. \"True sweet harmony\" The whole gang sang. Cash helped them up on the porch. \"Every crowd we face\" Cash sang then picked up Chennai and put her on his shoulders next to Cj. \"Every squirrel we chase\" Copper went on. Dixie picked up Texas and Austin and held them close. \"Any time any place\" The whole group sang. \"Cause we're in harmony\" \"Every tune we howl\" The kids chorused. \"Every line we growl\" Granny sang. \"Every note\" Waylon sang then Floyd continued. \"Every vowel\" \"Were in harmony\" The whole group sang together. \"We're in harmony We're in harm-ony-y-y Cause we're in harmony Harmony\" They finished the song and the talent scout cheered and grabbed Cash and spun him around in circles. \"Ha-ha I've finally found my act!Woo-hoo!You all gonna be stars! Weha woo-hoo!\" While He was celebrating Lyle pulled up in the bus. \"There you fellers are!\" He said. \"Are these friends of yours?\" The Scout asked Lyle. While they continued talking Cash stumbled into Dixie. Wait wait then what will happen next week? Fanfic girl of all worlds signing off till next week! stay super frosty![Chapter 11] \"Doh.\" Dixie said as Cash and her collided. \"Well, there you go Cash. You just got what you always wanted...\" Dixie said with a sad smile though in her mind she knew her and Cash might just be quits. \"I sure hope that this doesn't tear us apart... but oh, come now Dixie he wouldn' do that to you and the kids... would he? I mean he's always said he loved me and then we are married but are we strong enough to last through fame...\" But her thoughts were wrong he did love her. \"Maybe I had it all along...\" He said dreamily gazing into her brown eyes. She blinked and gasped looking straight at him with wide dreamy eyes. \"What are you sayin?\" She asked stepping back from him. \"What'd you think I'm sayin?\" \"Well you better be sayin what I think you're sayin.\" She said looking at the man who had won her heart since they met. Cash let out a chuckle then spoke. \"Huh-huh Well I think you know what I'm sayin is what you think I'm saying.\" \"Well I thought you'd never ask!\" Dixie chuckled as they shared a sweet kiss and tender hug. \"Now there's the good news...\" Cash murmured happily. The whole gang was celebrating as a deal was made with the talent scout for them to play. (THE GRAND OLD OPERY!) \"We go together like beggin and supper time\" Cash sang wrapping an arm around Dixie. \"Driven down the county line\" Chennai sang next to her father. \"hair blowing over time\" Cash junior sang with a huge grin next to his sister. Austin played a guitar and Texas played a fiddle while they sat on crates along with their family. \"We go together like a fiddle and a boe\" Granny sang then Waylon and Floyd sang. \"digging and a hoe, Biscuit and a bone\" \"I don't care if the cold wind blows\" The whole group sang. \"I don't care if don't show You can say it now or You can say it never But as long as we're going somewhere We go together Together Ooh-ooh-ooh Together Together Ooh-ooh-ooh We go together like wet dog and smelly Peanut butter jelly Fleas on my belly We go together like Fire flies and jars Chasing after cars A wish and a shooting star I don't care if the cold wind blows I don't care if the stars don't show You can say it now And you can say it never But as long as we're going somewhere We go together Together Ooh-ooh-ooh Together Together Ooh-ooh-ooh Come on\" Texas played a solo on her fiddle while Waylon and Floyd danced around to the music. \"We go together like a song in the air Like a once in a life-time memory you share We go together like dreams and prayers Like a little bit of heaven Yeah we're already there You can say it now or Stay forever~~~ But as long as were going somewhere We go together together ooh-ooh-ooh together together ooh-ooh-ooh together together ooh-ooh-ooh together together ooh-ooh-ooh Come on Oooh-Ooooo ooooh-Ooooo ooooh-ooooooooooooooh-ooooooooooooooh Ooooooooooooh-oooooooooooooooooh-ooooooooooooooh Ooooooooooh-oooooooooooooooh-oooooooooh-hooooooooo COME ON\" The whole gang finished the song and the audience erupted into a loud cheer for the band. (After the show on a Ferris wheel) \"I love you Cash\" Dixie whispered to him. \"I love you to Dix.\" He said tilting her head up and giving her a tender kiss on the lips. Chennai and Cj just watched the ride go up and watched the fireworks go off over head while Austin and Texas clung to one another as they went up high and heard the loud booms of the fireworks. \"Now I know why momma hate these...\" Austin whimpered out. \"Ye-yeah to high and loud...!\" Whined Texas holding her hands over her ears.

This little anthology is not that dissimilar from my FMA collection \"Chalk Dust\". I will post as bits and pieces are completed, so updates will be sporadic at best. Title: He Was Singing Summary: The wound had not killed him, but it had come damned close. The shattered rib and torn lung had healed long ago, but sometimes, it still felt like it was still killing him.

Promptfill: Prompt 09) If I was in pain I know you'd sing me soothing songs; from the \"If You Were…\" challenge at the 5_Prompts community at LiveJournal. Perry felt his eye twitch in irritation. Harry kept frowning and casting concerned glances at him across the dinner table. Thankfully, the younger man had as of yet said nothing about the blow Perry had taken earlier when the target caught them photographing him, or the consequent wincing and low hisses. It figured the bastard would have nailed Perry right in his old wound. Harry said nothing of this. Likewise, Perry said nothing of the concern written all over the ex-thief's face. Instead, the two stubbornly kept eating their spaghetti and discussing the important facts of the case. When his plate was empty, Harry pushed it back and paused a moment, his eyes locked on Perry. He opened his mouth to say something, but Perry stood abruptly. He blinked as his vision turned blurry for a split second, and when it cleared, Harry was watching him, and still with the concerned puppy eyes! \"I'll clean up, Harry,\" the detective said, picking up his roommate's plate and heading for the sink. Harry's chair grated against the floor as he stood as well. \"But it's my turn tonight, Per,\" he protested. \"You cooked, so it's my turn to wash up.\" \"I've got it, Harry,\" Perry said. \"Go pick a movie or something, I'll be out in a few minutes.\" Harry didn't move. Perry ignored him and started scrubbing tomato sauce off the plates and putting them in the dishwasher. He didn't look up, but he knew the younger man was watching him, waiting for another wince or twinge of discomfort. He steeled himself, determined not to let anything show. He was irritated with himself; it had healed months ago. Why was it still hurting at all? The man swung around, gun in hand, and Perry didn't think, just dove in front of the younger man, bringing his own pistol up. \"Harry, no!\" Two shots rang out, and his chest lit on fire. Perry dropped to the ground. Harry collapsed next to him. He lay there gasping, eyes roving as he tried to move, to get up, to fight. He let out a groan. He couldn't breath, couldn't see. Every nerve was on fire. He could feel blood soaking his clothes, feel his lung collapsing, feel the bullet moving with every twitch of his body, but he couldn't get up. He hadn't seen the thug with the gun fall, and now he could hear footsteps approaching. He had to get up! He was in danger… and Harmony was in danger… Harry was in danger! Harry was on his knees, crawling over to Perry. \"Come on, we gotta go!\" he gasped. \"Perry!\" The feet came closer, and the thug appeared, ugly sneer on his ugly face, revolver in hand. Dexter was strolling along next to him, smirking over the barrel of his own gun. They circled the downed men, guns directed at Perry's head, but he couldn't move. Just watch as they stopped. \" Perry. Nice to have known you,\" Dexter said, smiling pleasantly. He looked over at the gasping form kneeling over the detective and nodded. \"Ah, yes, Harry. From New York.\" He turned his gun - Perry was frozen, he couldn't move, why couldn't he move? - and fired, and Harry collapsed next to him, eyes unseeing. Perry couldn't move. He felt like screaming, like pulling Harry's limp form into his arms, like strangling Dexter with his bare hands…except he still. couldn't. MOVE. Dexter was still smiling, that cold, Hollywood smile, his gun pointed at Perry's head now. \"Ouch,\" he said. He pulled the trigger. It was black in front of his eyes when they finally tore themselves open. Perry arched his back as he woke with a strangled gasp, before collapsing back on the bed. A loud groan made his throat ache and his chest rattle. He put a hand to his ribs, even the light pressure from the weight of the limb causing tears to spring to his eyes. Teeth grinding, he sat up gingerly on the bed and tested himself. Drawing in the slightest, gentlest breath made him keel over on the bed, coughing and wheezing, wet lines of salt tracing down his face. He could feel the attack settling in. His lungs were spasming, each twitch of pain building upon itself. He couldn't breath, couldn't see…every nerve was on fire… Perry didn't hear his door open, or hear his roommate's feet padding across the hardwood floor. He was too focused on getting his lungs to take in air to feel the weight settling next to him on the bed, or the wiry arms taking him by the shoulders and pulling him back against a deceptively strong chest. The first thing alerting him to Harry having entered the room at all was a warm right hand making its presence known on his brow and guiding his head back on the younger man's shoulder. His cheek pressed up just under Harry's jaw, and he could feel the ex-thief's voice reverberating through his throat. It took Perry a moment before the noise in his ears faded enough to let in the soft, calm voice, and even then it still sounded distorted and far away. \"Easy, Per, you're alright,\" Harry murmured, and Perry wanted to smack him and roll his eyes, because clearly he was not alright. Unfortunately, he was too busy wheezing for breath and trying to ignore the stabbing sensation in his right side, again, again, again, tearing through every inhale and exhale. \"Relax, Perry… remember your breathing exercises? C'mon, you can do it, just breath with me, okay? He tried to match his own breathing to the other man's, slow and deep, in and out. His bullet-damaged lung was having none of it. What little vision he had of the darkened room silhouetted against the hall lights started to fizzle out, and it took him a moment to realize the pressure on his hand was Harry's hand, gently squeezing. \"Easy, easy…hold it for a few seconds, and try again. Come on, Perry, you can do this. Feel my breath?\" Perry could feel it. He could feel Harry's chest filling with the sweet air that was denied him, the brunette letting it out again in a slow stream that tickled Perry's throat. And he could, behind Harry's smooth voice and the steady hands stroking back his sweat-soaked hair, feel the brunette's terror, heartbeat racing and pounding like the hoof beats of a thoroughbred against his cheek. Distantly, Perry managed to grasp the notion that Harry was afraid. Perry didn't want Harry to be frightened. He wanted Harry to smile, to laugh, to always see the world with that goofy, sunlit optimism that he'd had since Perry had met him over a year ago, covered in dirt and blood at a party guest-starring some of Los Angeles' most eligible fuck-ups. Perry was floundering, struggling to gain a focus through the haze settling into his mind from pain and lack of oxygen, and he latched onto a single point of contact - Harry's hand was warm, and a little moist from nervous sweat. His fingers flexed a little - Perry's concentration briefly shattered to let his vision turn white… and then the scarred end of Harry's half-missing ring finger brushed against the back of Perry's own hand where it rested against the mostly mended bullet wound in his chest. Harry's old pain pressed to his old pain…there was some kind of romance to that, he supposed, but Harry was still straight and Perry was still suffocating. Perry could still feel Harry's chest rising and falling against his back, sense the thief's heart hammering away, nearly drowning out the rumbling of that soft, earnest voice. The rhythm of it took root in his mind, and he sank into it, counting out time to the motion, the beat, the melody. Harry had him, and though he normally would never admit it, he felt reassured by the very presence of his warmth and life. Exhausted, he slumped back against the younger man, let it all just float away into the music… Slowly, his breath eased, the tightness relaxed, the stabbing dulled. Perry felt his brain start working again, his mind clearing as oxygen finally reached it unhindered and without pain. The rushing in his ears faded out entirely, and with it no longer trying to drown out all other sounds, he could make sense out of what Harry was saying. The idiot was singing to him. Well… not literally, but he may as well have been. Harry was speaking low and slow and soft, and his voice was tender, drawling out the words in a gentle rumble. Perry's breathing finally evened out completely, matching the music, matching Harry. He let his eyes slip closed again in exhaustion. Harry's voice and his bare arms were warm and strong around him. End So this is the first of many promptfills and assorted onshots. Many of these can be considered sidestories and backstory for Bricks Without Clay, the KKBB/SH crossover I've been working on for the past year, pieces that didn't really fit with that but still count will end up stockpiled in here. Bricks Without Clay has NOT YET been posted, but the premiere date is fast approaching! Please leave a review to let me know what you think![Chapter 2] Title: Stuck In Neutral Summary: He was an irrepressible idealist, not a naïve idiot. Copyrights Disclaimer: Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and all characters therein are © Shane Black and Co. Warnings/Rating: PG-13 for language and implied homosexuality. Promptfill: Prompt 11) If I was in darkness you would lead me to the light; from the \"If You Were…\" challenge at the 5_Prompts community at LiveJournal. Perry was not a fool. He knew Los Angeles was not some conscious entity. It was not cruel, or friendly, dark, or light, or harsh, or hopeful, damning, or redeeming, or even impartial. It was just a city. All the \"broken dreams\" sob story crap people loved to sigh about was just that: sob story crap. He had lived in Los Angeles for more than half his life, had borne witness to the atmosphere and the people and the reality of the city. It was just a city. Perry was not a fool. He knew that it was the people who became these things, who allowed themselves to be illusioned or disillusioned or what have you. He was unaffected personally because didn't believe in all that romantic crap. But somehow he'd gotten himself stuck with the biggest romantic sap of all time. He pretended not to see Harry's disapproving (disappointed) gaze every time he returned in the early morning hours from his latest one night stand; he rarely stayed the whole night at the fag-of-the-week's house. Perry tried not to notice when Harry would peel away from him in the street to go press a ten or a twenty that he really couldn't afford to give away into the hand of some homeless person, and refrained from sniping that the vagrant was probably just going to head straight to a dealer or a liquor store. He ignored the sad puppy eyes that appeared whenever they watched the news, the anchorwoman's face a starkly cold contrast to Harry's as she reported on murders, rapes, kidnappings, assaults. He let these things go because if he acknowledged them, he would be forced to choose a side. Either he would shoot Harry down, or encourage his forlorn hopes further. Perry couldn't bring himself to do either. He was not a nice man, but he would not let himself become worse. Likewise, he was not the type to turn to blind faith. But Harry wasn't truly up for blind faith either. He just believed so strongly in love, and in the goodness of people. It wasn't that he didn't realize there was such a thing as evil or darkness. Harry was an irrepressible idealist, not a naïve idiot. What made Harry so special was that he refused to believe that bad things were inevitable , and that made him hopeful where other people were cynical. That hope was dangerous and fragile and beautiful. Dangerous because it set him up for disappointment at every turn. Fragile because any disappointment could be the one that broke it - and by proxy, broke Harry - for good. Beautiful because Harry knew these things, and still clung to his hope like a life raft, and it made him into this wonderful, powerful creature. Perry may not have shared that hope, but he certainly shared the glow of it, the sense of peace and light. Harry carried it around like he had it tucked into his wallet, ready to pull out and hand off like the bills he gave to the needy people on the streets. Sometimes Perry wanted to lock Harry up in their home and not let him leave, for fear that today would be the day that Harry's heart finally broke, and turned into one the dull souls that somehow he hadn't become yet. Perry couldn't quite believe that Harry had made it thirty-seven long fucking years, through New York, Los Angeles, divorce, prison, and still had so much hope for the world. Sometimes, the sheer strength of that dangerous, fragile, beautiful, powerful thing made him believe it. Sometimes Harry made him hope too. Perry was not a fool. He knew enough to know giving up Harry would be giving up on life. And that was okay, because he knew Harry wasn't going anywhere anytime soon. And if he did, Perry was almost certain Harry would insist on Perry's company. Perry certainly wouldn't protest. End Hmmm…these haven't been particularly positive so far…must rectify this! I'll try to make sure that the next couple will be more cheery. In any case, I hope you enjoy, and please be sure to leave a review letting me know what you think![Chapter 3] Title: The Breadwinner Summary: Harry never has to worry about where his next meal is coming from anymore, and that's almost a bigger gift than Perry's friendship itself.

Promptfill: 10) If I was hungry you would feed me; from the \"If You Were…\" challenge at the 5_Prompts community at LiveJournal. Author's Note: I'M TOO ELOQUENT TO WRITE HARRY. *cries* I keep having to dumb down my writing because my usual vocabulary sounds too fancy and educated (I'm an art history/literature major). WHICH SUCKS because I loves me some Harry! ;A; I'm so sorry I fail at writing you bb! Also, I am quickly starting to hate trying to post at Livejournal. The people there are wonderful, but it keeps trying to kill my formatting. :( New York is absolutely frigid this time of year, especially at this time of night. You'd think, having grown up in Indiana, that I'd be used to the cold, but noooo. Give me a sweltering heat wave anytime. Now would be nice, actually. Because like I said, it's really fucking cold. It doesn't help that it's windy as hell and about to start raining - or even snowing - anytime now. You might be wondering why I would be outside in the middle of the night in the middle of a storm when it's almost below twenty degrees outside. I'm wondering that myself, actually. Normally I wouldn't be out right now unless I was on a job… but I'm so fucking starving. I get to the little 24 hour store on the corner and hurry inside. It's dry and the air is still, and I can hear the heater running and pause a moment just to enjoy it - the heat in my apartment hasn't been working right for weeks, so the only times I've felt really warm is when I'm inside a store or something. At the jingle of the bell on the door, the guy behind the counter looks up. I give him a friendly smile. He narrows his eyes before offering a cold one in return, making me falter only a little. Unfriendly asshole. But I'm pretty much used to people thinking I'm little more than scum, and it doesn't really bother me so much anymore, so I let it go. He watches me carefully as I move around the shop, trying to figure out how much I can buy with the ten in my pocket, because between the rent and a lack of good hauls lately, it's all I have for now. I can feel my heart sinking when I realize how little that amount really is. He doesn't take his eyes off me. It's a little unnerving, especially when I look up and catch his eye, and he just gazes intently back at me. My smile this time is a little strained, a little uncomfortable. I wish he wouldn't stare at me like that. I come up to the register with a loaf of bread and two bags of beef jerky. I give the cigarettes behind the counter a longing glance - because, dammit, I could really use a smoke - while he rings up the total. I can only just barely manage to cover the tax, so there's no way I can get my nicotine fix until I can get some more cash. I give Mr. Creepy Staring Shopguy a thank you that's as cheery and polite as I can manage, to which he grunts and gives me a sarcastic smile that looks more like a sneer as he shakes out his newspaper. I pull my coat a little closer and head for the door. The air pressure from the wind pushes it back, and I grit my teeth against the freezing air that hits me. I can feel the shopkeeper's eyes follow me until I pass out of the view from the window. My food is in a paper bag that I hug close to my chest, trying to keep it as dry as possible, and I have two cents leftover in my pocket. Back at my tiny apartment, I put the bread and jerky both in the fridge - because cold food sucks, but moldy food is worse - and then grin as I start pulling candy bars out of my sleeves. A box of Poptarts and a narrow jar of trail mix are pulled out of the front of my coat. These, and the candy, bread, and jerky, join the lone orange and half-gone bottle of apple juice on the shelf. I eye my meager stockpile doubtfully and settle on a jerky and M&M; sandwich for dinner. I should be good for another week with this. We're in a restaurant, a proper one with individual menus and cloth napkins and real dishes and silverware. \"We\" includes me and Perry and Harmony, and the waiters have cleared away a chair so that Perry's wheelchair can fit at the table. Unfortunately, the table and chairs are too high, so it still comes up nearly to Perry's chest. He grimaces but says nothing. I think he believes it's worth it just to be out of the hospital and away from the horrible health food they shoved down our throats during our stay. I know I'm glad to have finally left. I can feel both of them staring at me while I wolf down my food. I'm not sloppy or anything, but I still finish every crumb before either of them is half done, and then sit there fidgeting and feeling awkward for the rest of the meal. I laugh and try to brush it off, and they both smile a bit uncertainly, but I still catch them giving me sidelong looks when they think I can't see - this one says 'is Harry just being a weirdo again?' and the other says 'there must be something wrong.' Both of my two best friends are shooting me both those looks. Dammit. I mean, I know I have trouble keeping my emotions off my face at times, but really, this isn't something they need to worry about. Hell, this isn't something that I need to worry about. Not anymore. Inwardly, I'm kicking myself for it, berating myself. No one's going to take it away, Harry. It's not like this is another stolen meal you might catch trouble for, Harry. You have an income now, Harry, you don't need to worry about this being the last full meal you'll have for the week. It doesn't work. I still feel that happy sort of feeling that comes with a full stomach, laced with the slightest flicker of dread that I won't see as much food as this for a while. Harmony asks if I'm still hungry and it takes every ounce of willpower to say no. And I'm not , not really. I'm kinda used to not having much food, so I don't really want anything else right now. Except I do, because I'm kinda fucked up, if you haven't noticed, and if I didn't have my pride, I'd probably have asked for a box and scraped both their plates clean, just to ensure that I'd have some food for later. It's just instinct, or something, for me to be this careful about food, but I know it's not normal, and I know I can stop worrying about it, but I just can't . Perry says nothing except that their garlic bread is too salty for his tastes as he puts his roll on my emptied plate. I manage to mutter a mortified thank you and chew it slowly, avoiding my best friends' eyes. Worse still is the moment when it's time to pay the bill. Harmony tries to pay for me, but Perry is having none of it and insists on paying for all three of us. He waves his ATM card at us as an excuse, saying it makes more sense than each of us trying to pay for our separate meal when there's only one tab. Which is very efficient of him, just the sort of thing you'd expect from Perry. But he also refuses to accept reimbursement from Harmony. My face burns and I shift uncomfortably, because Perry already paid for my recent medical bills. And not only were they extensive ('cause, yanno…bullet wounds, electrocution, spontaneous finger amputation-and-digestion, and general beatings kind of lead to an extensive bill) but I don't even have any medical insurance to help cover the cost either. And if that wasn't already enough, he's also offered me both a job with him and a place to stay. I mean, what the hell? I'm just the idiot from New York who got him shot within four days of meeting him. He really has no business trying to pay any of this, let alone for my food too, and let's also not forget Harmony's meal. But even though I know all of this, even though I could technically pay for this particular meal myself, the selfish, self-preservation-y part of me is locked in place, making me reluctant to even offer. Not that Perry would even accept it anyways, I know. He'd just shove it back across the table at me like he did for Harmony. But there's still that little voice whispering that if I offered him the eight dollars, I wouldn't see them again, so I hold my tongue for once. It's quiet in the car, the radio off for once because I can see the migraine building in the lines on Perry's forehead. It's late, past midnight, and we've been out on a surveillance for the past five hours. I'm exhausted, Perry is exhausted, and we both just want to go home. I try to ignore the growling in my stomach and concentrate on everything I'm going to pile together into a sandwich when we get home. I want turkey, chicken, and ham, and tomatoes, and olives, American cheese and some of that fancy havarti stuff Perry likes, and put it all between wheat bread slathered with ranch dressing. God, I'm hungry…you know what, I actually don't care what's on it as long as it's FOOD… and this so isn't helping. I'm so distracted I hardly notice Perry pulling into a shopping center parking lot until I hear the static on the intercom. \"Hi, welcome to Taco Bell! What can I get you?\" I shift a little and stare at Perry. \"What are you doing, Perry? You hate Taco Bell.\" \"Well I figured you were hungry. Or was your stomach just having a lover's quarrel with your intestines?\" I blink and grin, and quickly tell him what I want before he changes his mind. Five minutes later, and Perry sipping a diet coke through a straw while I chow down on a grilled stuft burrito. I moan with appreciation and Perry makes a face. \"Thank you, Perry,\" I say before he can complain about the noise. If my voice sounds too happy over a burrito, I tell myself it's because it's a damned good burrito. It's not because I am no longer damned hungry. It's certainly not because Perry is being nice to me. Which he isn't . Not really, anyways. My stomach growls were probably just making his headache worse. \"Just don't get beans on the seat,\" is all he says. I readjust the damp washcloth on my forehead for what feels like the hundredth time and let out a miserable sigh that wastes no time turning into a rough cough. It feels like my throat is tearing itself up, and by the time I regain control over myself, Perry has appeared in the living room door, eyeing me with concern. Oh boy, I must look really bad to be getting that look from him now. He stands there and watches me sniffle. I sit here and watch the television screen. After a minute, he moves into the room, closer to where I've curled up on the couch. \"Harry, are you hungry? You should eat some dinner. You haven't eaten all day.\" I groan. I am hungry. But I haven't eaten all day because I was certain if I tried, I'd just throw it back up, and Perry would kill me if I stained his perfect white carpets. I shake my head and manage to rasp out a 'no, thank you,' ignoring both the look on his face and the churning in my stomach. He doesn't move, and I steal a glance at him. Fuck, why is he still giving me that look, like I'm a puppy he wants to take home and fatten up? Perry doesn't even like puppies, and he's certainly not the type to take one home to feed. Anyways, I go back to staring fixedly at the TV as soon as our eyes meet, and he doesn't say anything. I pointedly ignore his presence until the commercials finally come on, at which point I steal another glance… But he's gone from the room. Fuck me, I've been pointedly ignoring an empty room. You'd think, since I'm sick, Perry would at least have the decency to stay in one spot and let me ignore him but nooooo, he has to be all, sneaky-ninja-Perry and disappear in the middle of me ignoring him. Fuck. Now I'm sick, hungry, and embarrassed. I sit up, a bit tired, but not too weak, and hit the mute button on the clicker. Without the blaring noise from the soap commercial (why are the commercials always like, ten times as loud as the program? It's ridiculous and annoying) I can hear Perry in the kitchen, pans clattering as he starts to cook. I stay on the couch for couple minutes, watching the commercials on mute and listening to Perry making something. The show comes back on, but I don't un-mute it yet. Instead, as I hear something start to sizzle in a pan, I get up from the couch, pulling a blanket around my shoulders, and pad into the next room. Perry's standing at the stove, frying something up. There's a bowl on the counter and a collection of various ingredients that I look over as I sit down at the table. It's a really strange assortment of items to have out for one dish. I try to imagine what they might make together, but my head aches too badly to figure it out. I give up and rest my head on my arms with another pitiful groan that makes my manhood wince, but I feel too shitty to actually be all embarrassed over it. I'm still watching Perry, and he seems to notice. He glances over his shoulder and frowns. \"Stay over there. I don't want your cold germs in my dinner,\" he says. I try to snort and fail through the congestion, instead triggering another coughing fit. \"Oh thanks,\" I finally manage to gasp out. \"Your concern for my well-being is so touching.\" \"Shut up,\" he says, but there's no heat in the words. I turn my head to press my eyes into my arm, shutting out the impossibly bright kitchen lights. Ten minutes later a plate is thunked down in front of my face, startling me. I lift my head a little to see a short, steaming stack of pancakes in front of me, a little butter and syrup (less than usual) dripping down the sides. My whole mouth waters. Perry sits down across from me. He has eggs and bacon with his pancakes, but the very sight of them makes my stomach clench and I have to look away. For a minute, I'm very glad that I can't smell anything. Perry frowns at me again. \"Eat that. I know you don't feel good, but you need to have something. It'll probably help settle your stomach just to have something in it anyways.\" He takes a bite of eggs. I stare at him dolefully, then look down at the pancakes. Fuck, they look great. My stomach growls and Perry smirks. I give him a glare as I pick up my fork, but it's too soft for him to feel offended, just like his snarking earlier was too soft to offend me. The pancakes are… really good, soft and sweet and hot. Perry makes the best pancakes I've ever had anywhere. Normally I'd have more syrup than is on these, but if I had any more sugar on this, I probably really would throw up. Didn't really matter, they were still perfect just like this. Perry's pancakes (and wouldn't that make a great name for a breakfast diner) would even be great cold with nothing on them. Actually, I've had them cold and they were almost even better. People underestimate the value of cold and reheated foods sometimes. I guess I'm more used to it because back in New York, that was sometimes all I had, but even now that I'm living with Perry and don't have to have food that's cold or not quite fresh, every now and then I'll have a hankering for some of the foods that I'd found tasted as good or better when you're just slumming the kitchen….goddammit, I'm getting sidetracked again! Of course, Perry was right; within five bites of pancake-y goodness, the weight in my stomach has helped calm it down, and I no longer feeling like I'm going to make a mess on the floor. I speed up and start taking bigger bites, and Perry actually has to tell me to slow down a little, but he's smirking as he says it and the lines on his forehead have smoothed out a little, and I realize I've been worrying him. I almost feel guilty, but then I remember, I'm sick! Of course he should be worrying about me! By the time I've finished I can feel myself starting to doze off right there at the table. Perry sweeps my plate out from under me before I get a face full of syrup, taking it to the sink to rinse it. \"Go to bed, idiot.\" He says without looking up. I sleepily murmur an agreement and get up, yawning. \"Thanks, Per,\" I slur on my way out, \"was really good…\" Twenty minutes later, I've poured myself into bed and am drifting into some much-needed rest when I hear the door crack open. I roll over and look back at my door to see Perry peeking in, checking on me. He looks a little uncomfortable when he sees that I've seen him being all protective and caretaker-y. Our eyes stay locked as he seems to argue with himself whether or not he should say something, and finally he spits out whatever gay, sentimental thing he's stressing over saying. \"Sleep well, Harry.\" I look back at him for a moment before flipping over entirely to face him and close my eyes again. \"Night, Per.\" End GODDAMN. I WANT PANCAKES NOW. (also I promise there will be happy fics in here too! ;A; Really!)[Chapter 4] Title: Hard at Work Summary: Procrastination can be so inspiring.

The younger man had been idling at his desk all day, working through the stack of paperwork on his desk more slowly than usual. Perry understood perfectly; he wasn't fond of paperwork either, and both of them had far too much energy to be stuck inside at a desk today. But it did have to get done. Fifteen minutes later, he took another look. Harry was still staring at him, and the paper he had in front of him was the same one that had been there forty-five minutes ago. Finally, under the strain of his own boredom paired with Harry's slacking, Perry's temper snapped. He slammed his pen down on the table and glared. \"Dammit, Harry, focus on your work!\" Harry smirked and propped his head up on his arm. \"I am focusing.\" Perry narrowed his eyes, and opened his mouth to say something, then shut it with a snap when the younger man abruptly stood up. Perry watched with (interest) uncertainty as Harry positively slinked across the room and pulled Perry's chair away from his desk. The brunette somehow managed to straddle Perry's lap, wedging his knees in between Perry and the arms of the desk chair and getting the both of them well and thoroughly stuck in the tight space. Very tight, if the state of Harry's jeans was any indication. The ex-thief leaned down and skimmed his breath over Perry's ear. \"Oh yes, I'm working very hard,\" he whispered lasciviously. The detective's eyes widened and he instinctively grasped Harry's waist, trying to wrestle his libido back under control. Unfortunately, his excellent senses had turned their full attention to three points: A) a clever tongue, tracing the outer edge of his ear. B) the warm skin of Harry's abdomen under his hands, C) a distinct, hard, heated bulge at Harry's groin, being pressed against his lower stomach. Harry then nearly ruined the entire (sexy) effect by sitting back on Perry's thighs and waggling his eyebrows with an amused grin. It should have looked ridiculous, but somehow, Harry could make that of all things actually look good. Perry promptly decided he didn't care how much work they finished today. He seized Harry by the head and pulled him in for a kiss. 'Well, at least I know he can focus on something ,' Perry thought. End I have several much longer stories coming, but they're only half-done.

Hand kink\" (also, my theme song for writing this was totally \"I Like The Way You Move\" by Bodyrockers, from which I got the title) Author's Note: Okay I lied at the end of the last chapter. Here, have some PWP. At least there's sexy times in this one. (lol I actually got so carried away with that scene, I almost had to bump up the overall rating) LALALALA TOTALLY AM NOT STALLING ON LIKE 4-5 OTHER WIP'S, WHATCHU TALKIN' ABOUT? (6-25-11 edited a portion of the second part a little) Perry is going mad; that is all there is to it. Harry was already crazy, of course, and he's dragging Perry right down with him. He just can't stop staring… but that would be a whole lot easier if Harry would just stop moving so much. It seems like every time Harry does something, just the slightest little motion, Perry's attention is immediately grabbed. He feels like a cat chasing a laser pointer sometimes, when he's watching Harry. The man is incapable of remaining still for more than a few minutes. His hands are the worst - and simultaneously, the best, because by now, Perry can't even make himself want to stop watching them flying and fluttering, just as expressive as the man's face. He was so unrestrained; he had no qualms about letting everything running through his mind not only coming spilling out of his mouth, but flow from every part of his being. His hands seemed to be the highlighted outlet for this purpose. He gestures while he talks. He gestures when he's quiet. He fucking dances to anything remotely resembling music, up to and including things only he seems to hear sometimes, somewhere in the workings of that mysterious little thing he calls a brain. He even does it while he's on the phone, with his cell or the office or home phone pressed against his ear with his shoulder to allow for the wild gesticulating despite the other person not being able to see him. The strange part, or maybe not so much strange as simply most noticeable, is that the movements of his hands always tie directly into what he's saying so seamlessly. People take as many cues about Harry's feelings and opinions from how his hands are moving as they do from the tone of his voice or the twisting of his facial features. It would not seem so out of the ordinary had they been anywhere but L.A., where people are so false-faced that their words tie literally more into simple nothing than into communication. Harry is completely unabridged and uncensored, and Perry has never been more attracted to anything in his life. He tries to blame L.A., but there's really no point in that. He'll never know if he would have still found Harry so compellingly real if he'd lived somewhere else. But even if he did not in this theoretical alternate setting, Perry does in the here and now. As a realist, that is all that matters to him in the end. So he accepts it, and deals with it. It would be so easy to ignore it and carry on, if it weren't for those goddamned hands. Those graceful, thieving, careworn, elegant magician's hands, constantly moving and drawing his attention back to them, interchangeably ruggedly capable in form, and intricately playful of movement. He tries hard not to notice, and he tries not to let Harry notice that he notices, because if Harry knew some of things that Perry imagined him doing with his hands, he was certain that Harry would panic worse than he had the time Perry kissed him, back on their first case together. And the last thing he wants is for Harry to leave. Now, as for Harry, he likes watching Perry move, and does not bother trying to hide his glances. If Perry notices and asks why the fuck Harry is staring at him, Harry's usual response is to just smile and calmly move his attention to something else for a few minutes, and then let his eyes wander back to Perry. He can't help it, really. The detective is just so fluid and efficient, his motions all militarily precise and never, ever, wasted. He wishes sometimes that he could adopt that kind of economy in his own mannerisms. Maybe people would take him more seriously if he didn't flail around like a sugar-high five-year-old all the time. It doesn't take him long to realize that watching the older man move turned him on, and far more than just a mild, oh-dear-maybe-I-like-men-as-well sort of way. If the idea of feeling that sort of attraction towards another man was disconcerting at all, it was swallowed up by Harry's intense and innate curiosity. Sex with a man would, of course, be very different than sex with a woman, but not necessarily in a bad way. Skin and sweat and friction was the same whether it was attached to a male or female form, after all. At its most essential basics, sex was about human contact, preferably with someone you loved. Perry is definitely someone Harry loved. He's known that since their third case together, when Perry had smiled at him over a late night cup of coffee and thanked him for being a kind-hearted idiot all the time. He had said that he wished more people could be like Harry, and then maybe the world wouldn't be such a fucked-up place. Even knowing that Perry was pretty whacked out on painkillers for his dislocated shoulder at the time couldn't stop Harry from feeling absolutely touched, and just like that, Harry had realized he really, truly loved this man. And just like that, as though all he needed to feel attracted to someone was to acknowledge that he loved them, his body started noticing Perry's body. In particular, Harry's eyes are constantly drawn to the older man's hands. Often, he finds himself fantasizing about those hands running over his body. He wonders fretfully, on occasion, if he is focusing on Perry's hands so that he won't be thinking of something else , something that is only associated with a male partner; because hands are hands, and both men and women alike can use those to greatly pleasurable effect. After the first time he has this disconcerting thought, Harry begins to pay even more careful attention to Perry's hands, drinking in every fine detail. With time and thought, he is relieved to determine that no, he is not just androgynizing Perry in his mind to get around the gay factor. No, those hands are too distinctively Perry to make Harry think of a woman's touch, an allegory that Harry delights in unraveling and picking apart. And from the pieces, he begins to assemble a deeper understanding of this man, and why Harry finds him so compelling. Perry's hands, he's taken care to notice, are large and strong; they could easily fold around Harry's fist and hide it almost entirely from view. Perry's hands are not as dexterous as his own, a fact that Harry takes gleeful pleasure rubbing in Perry's face every chance he gets; it's not like he gets one-up on Perry very often, after all. Perry's hands are not as habitually tactile as Harry's either. For all their assertiveness, they keep to themselves more often than not, reluctant to make contact. Often, when contact is made, it lingers, light and gentle, as though they are afraid to break as much as they are to pull away. And, Harry has secretly observed, Perry's hands are lightly callused and neatly kept. He will treasure the memory of walking in on Perry giving himself a manicure until the day he dies. Perry's fury from the encroachment on his privacy was well worth the mockery material (Perry has no shame, or it would have been blackmail material as well). Perry's fury was also just as well-worth the sensuous image itself, but Perry doesn't need to know about that part. He would never let Harry hear the end of it if he knew. It continues with a look. They had been talking, arguing, or something, neither can even remember now, because when you stop mid-sentence and realize what the expression on your companion's face is saying, the sounds coming out of either mouth stop mattering so much. That expression was a concession, a confession, a permission slip to reach out and touch - finally, finally - and they both stretched out their hands at almost the same time, Harry just a little bit ahead of Perry for once, instead of the other way around. Slight surprise registered then as well, and that odd, bashfully awkward feeling you get when you are walking towards someone, and they towards you, and you both veer to the same side to walk around, both double-take back the other way, and again, until you both grin and chuckle and finally get it right and pass without touching. Except that neither Perry nor Harry was inclined to veer to either side, and so when they both reached to cup the other's cheek, their hands instead met in midair. This has worked out better in the end anyways, because now they both hold the focal point on their respective objects of admiration, quite literally, in the palms of their hands. Their fingertips touch first, and they freeze for a split second. Then Harry turns his wrist so that the heel of his palm comes forward to kiss Perry's, and their fingers straighten out, hands pressing flat against each other. Harry opens his mouth, and Perry is suddenly terrified that the idiot is going to make some dumb Disney Tarzan joke and ruin the moment, so he leans forward in his seat like he's going to kiss him. Harry copies the motion eagerly, and their foreheads touch and they freeze again. Perry twists his gaze away from the mahogany orbs in front of him, moving to their hands pressed against each other. He slides the pads of his fingertips down the underside of Harry's fingers, the ring finger thrown off a little from the missing phalanges on its partner, but that's okay. It even almost works as a dumb sort of metaphor, Perry thinks, and then promptly mentally scolds himself. Their fingers are curled around each other like kittens, and Perry's palm is itching from the sensation of Harry's weather-beaten skin against his. Then Harry's fingers twitch, and opposing digits slip between each other like water, and their hands are pressed palm to palm, fingers tangled casually, lovingly. Perry is hard as a rock and he hasn't even kissed Harry yet. From Harry's rough breathing he can tell the younger man is feeling it too, this intense awareness of the other's presence, heated and real against his palm. It is a closer and more intimate connection with another person than he's ever felt in his life… or maybe that's just the long-denied sexual tension storming up to the surface, but somehow Perry doesn't think so. As though realizing the others are being neglected, Harry now takes Perry's left hand in his right, tangling the fingers together here too, marking the difference in texture and color and size between their hands. Harry studies those hands, and glances back at the first pair, and pulls all fifteen-and-a-half fingers, all four thumbs, all four hands, to meet in front of them, clasped between his chin and Perry's, still leaning his forehead against the blonde's. Perry is watching their hands, watching the tendons flex under the skin when Harry squeezes his palm. Harry smiles at how intent Perry is in his examinations, always so focused. An eternity later, Perry finally looks up, meets Harry's gaze, and presses a soft kiss against the tip of each finger. He lingers a little longer on the damaged one, and Harry has to hold back a throaty moan at the sparks even this gentle contact send up the raw nerve endings there. Partly to keep from making any sounds, partly just because he wants to, and partly to avenge his gently abused finger, Harry retaliates by sucking Parry's left thumb into his mouth whole. The first reason he had for doing so is swiftly discarded when Perry swipes against the back of Harry's teeth with the pad of his thumb, and he has to close his eyes and groan heartily. He tastes salt and laves at it, pressing his tongue against the digit. Harry lets Perry slip the other four fingers free from his, shifting his wrist to get better access to Harry's mouth. Harry bites gently at the base, and the rest of that large warm hand presses against his cheek. Harry places his free hand over it, trapping it there. Perry is the one who groans this time, even louder than Harry. Harry slowly opens his eyes and watches Perry steadily, suckling his thumb. Perry withdraws it slowly, and the feel of that slightly rough skin running over his lower lip is enough to make him buck slightly. Perry moves from his place then, adjusting Harry on the couch so that they are facing each other properly. Harry is laying back and Perry is straddling his hips, bringing their erections into maddening proximity, but Harry's mind has fixed, as it does sometimes, onto one point: Perry's hands. Perry's hands, which have now slipped free and are roaming all over his body, down his sides, across his stomach, back up to his chest to tweak his nipple through his shirt. Harry gasps and arches his back, but just as he's leaning into the contact it is gone, Perry's hands skittering back down his abdomen to take hold of his waist. He no longer knows what to do with his own hands, and they twitch and flail a little in midair before finally landing on Perry's shoulders and wandering off on some territorial explorations of their own. Harry's fingers dance across the skin of his shoulders, pulling him down in close so that their lips finally touch. The kiss is heaven, is life, is what Perry has been searching for, but Harry's hands are still moving, still very distracting. Rough palms slide up his neck, clever fingers slide into his hair, tangling into his ponytail and pulling him in even closer. Fingernails scraping lightly against his scalp make him shiver, and his grip on Harry's hips tightens as he thrusts against the brunette, tense from trying to restrain the movement. Then Harry raises his hips, and their groins are grinding against each other. Perry is shaking from the effort it takes to keep himself raised up, not wanting to collapse on top of the smaller man and crush him. With a growl, he gives Harry's waist one last squeeze and moves his hands up to press into the couch on either side of Harry's head, giving himself better support and better leverage to thrust against him. Harry wants to protest the loss of Perry's hands on him, but the friction down there is enough to distract him for a moment, and he finds himself pressing up harder, pulling Perry in closer, and his moan is just as much pleasure as disappointment. His arms are starting to cramp, so he loosens up a little. His left hand lets go of Perry's hair and strokes gently against the back of the blonde's neck, caressing, gentle. His right is pulled back between them, reaching down to tug at the hem of Perry's shirt. The brilliant idea to flip them over so that he is on top suddenly pops into Harry's head. Before he has time to give the matter any further thought, Harry impulsively surges upwards and turns over on his side at the same time. Perry is flung off the couch, pulling away from the kiss with a startled cry. Instinctively, he grabs at Harry, trying to keep from falling, but all he does is pull Harry off the couch with him. Harry, of course, goes along with this quite happily, until he remembers the part where he has to land on top of Perry. By then it's too late, and Perry lands on his back hard, and then Harry lands solidly on top of him, knocking the wind out of him and barely missing knocking their heads together. \"Fuck!\" Perry gasps, wincing, \"The hell did you do that for?\" Harry cringes and pushes himself up painfully; Perry wasn't as good of a landing pad as he'd thought. \"Sorry, sorry! Ow. Fuck, that was stupid. Sorry.\" Perry puts a hand up on his forehead, pushing his hair out of his eyes, and tries to glare at the brunette kneeling over him. Harry looks just as dazed as he feels, boner still heavy against Perry's thigh, and eyes cloudy with a mixture of lust and dizziness. Perry's aggravation melts away, and he can't help but burst into laughter. Harry squints down at him, cracking a grin of his own, and Perry tugs him down closer, murmuring a fond \"C'mere, dumbass,\" through his snickering. Harry smiles and lays down against Perry's chest, and Perry's arms wrap around him as they dissolve into hysterical giggles. After a minute they quiet down some, and Harry tilts his head back to look at Perry, and Perry twists down a little to look back at him, and simultaneously the giggles break out again. Another few minutes pass, and the mirth fades out enough that they can breath again. Harry stretches to plant a firm kiss on Perry's lips. Perry cups his face and pulls him into a deeper one, but the giggle fit still hasn't loosed its hold yet. They are smiling against each other's mouths, and laughing too hard to keep kissing. So they pull apart and nuzzle each other like cats, still chuckling. Harry tucks his head under Perry's chin and listens to the vibrations in his chest, and looks down at their entwined hands laying clasped together, and smiles. End. Mmmm PWP.

To my old readers, welcome back, and I hope you stick around for my newer work. If y"},{"Movie":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang","Title":"Old Acquaintances","Author":"xgraciela","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5889627","Passage":"[Chapter 1] You won't catch me unprepared this time! No bad narrating will happen, because I'm checking it over and over and I'm being careful from the start so there won't be any mistakes! Um...right, there may be some...I'll try, okay? Which means I need to start at the beginning and that sucks, because the short beginning is a little bit boring and you came here for the action, didn't you? But geez, you always wanted me to narrate chronologically, remember? So that's what I'm gonna do. Once upon a time... What?! I can hear your boo all the way from where you are! I thought we agreed on a boring start... Okay, I won't torture you anymore. There are two things you need to know. Perry and I are together and - I'm straight. Huh, weird combination, but believe me, it works out somehow. And don't let yourself fall under impression that being together means no more insults from Perry. I think the frequency might have even increased since he'd first really kissed me. You don't want to know what I'm being called now. According to Perry at most of the times I'm not even capable of tying my own shoes. Well, you get the point. I said these first paragraphs would be boring, but stick with me, because it will be referenced later in the story - just thought I would let you know. Anyhow, it all started with a very ordinary stakeout. Nothing serious, just tedious stuff you don't need or don't want to know. However, things got interesting when we wanted to go back home. Perry was bitching about my incompetence as usual. \"You are not able to even take a few shots!\" He growled. \"I took some!\" \"Yeah, but they contain only your left index and middle finger. Good thing you don't have the ring finger, otherwise it would have been there as well.\" He was angry. Oookay, maybe I really destroyed a good piece of evidence, but no need to yell, right? \"Next time you are not getting your hands anywhere near the camera, understand?\" I nodded. It was better than the last time when he threatened to never take me with him again. We continued in our banter and didn't notice a man following us, first probably just walking a few streets behind, then driving behind our car as well. It might or might have not been my fault, but I don't want to blame myself in the first page of my story, got it? Perry was exhausted, because it was his third work-night in a row so he let me drive. You know how good driver I am, so I concentrated on not getting us killed and not ruining Perry's shiny car, which meant I really didn't have time to check if some asshole is going after us. Thinking back about it now, I guess it really was my fault, because Perry surely would have seen him if he had been awake. \"Hey! We are here. Time for real bed.\" I shook him slightly once we arrived. That earned me a hateful glance and some combination of foul words which I don't want remember. Yeah, I really love the man, stop asking stupid questions. Something seemed off when we stepped out, but I didn't react as I should have. Perry was still dead on his feet when we made our way towards the door. \"Hands up and don't move!\" A voice told us - very unpleasant if you ask me. We both stopped in our tracks and Perry jerked a little, snapping out of his slumber. \"What the fuck?\" Was his immediate reaction and, truth to say, mine too, but I wasn't brave enough to actually say it aloud. We stared at each other for a while. \"I said hands up! Now!!\" The man commanded and I complied. No need to anger them more, believe me. I have some practice in this field. Perry on the other hand is not used to being ordered around - that's my job - so it took him a bit longer to comply. \"I won't repeat it!\" The man hissed and we heard a weird rustling sound. As if someone had shot, but without the loud \"bang\". It took me a second, but then I realized that the psycho behind us had a gun. A gun with muffler. Perry was quicker than me and turned already, his hands up just a little bit. \"Calm down.\" He said, but I could tell that the man wouldn't listen. I turned as well, my hands above my head and my heart in my throat. Getting beaten up that I'm used to, but guns mean serious business and I really hate them. \"Right, listen to him and calm down, I'm sure--\" I was cut off by another shot which missed my head by about ten inches. Great. I could feel Perry startle slightly next to me when the guy fired. \"What do you want?\" Perry's voice was dangerously low, but I got other concerns than to analyze it...like not getting myself or us both killed and how to get the fuck away. \"All in good time.\" The man snickered and pointed his toy at my face so I could enjoy the view. \"Now you'll do what I say or this will end badly since I'm going to shoot again and I won't miss this time.\" It was dark, but I swear I could see the slick grin plastered all over his face. Perry was quiet, probably considering all the possibilities, but judging from the lack of his action, there wasn't anything he could do to save us. \"Come closer. Slowly.\" The psycho barked. We did. He put the gun on my head and started searching my body for possible weapons. According to Perry I couldn't be trusted with any gun after the last Christmas (go, see the movie for details), so he found nothing and moved to Perry. I was hoping that maybe his little faggot gun will save us at some point in the near future, but this guy apparently wasn't homophobe, so yeah - he checked even there . \"Nice touch.\" He grinned and threw the derringer far away. \"Almost missed that.\" Perry made a face. \"You son of a bitch! What the hell is this all about?!\" He was angry. Really angry, not like when he's yelling at me. The gun was back at my temple in a second. \"Shut up or he's dead.\" Perry threw me a nervous glance and I gulped, because the gun butt was freakingly cold and something told me this wouldn't end well. \"That's it. I'm glad you are willing to co-operate. Let's make a small trip.\" He pointed to his huge dark car. \"And no games. One foul move and I'm shooting, clear?\" His voice was still so cold and hissing that it sent a shiver down my spine. We went back to his car two or three steps in front of him. Clever reader can notice that the psycho had even this distance problem covered. No way we could escape. When we sat down inside the car, there was a driver and another man waiting. The car sped up very quickly and I wondered if it was possible for some cops to catch us. That could be the first time when seeing cops would make me smile. Sadly, no one seemed interested in this black Volvo. I didn't pay attention to the man in the front seat, because the other one had his gun still pointed in mine or Perry's direction and that was making me nervous. There was a long silence, but after few turns a voice good deal colder than I thought was even possible spoke from the passenger seat. \"Nice to meet you again Perry. \" tbc Thanks for reading![Chapter 2] \"What?! Stone?\" Perry asked, and it occurred to me that we were probably in a deep shit. I mean, it can't end well when someone you know and call him by name is holding you captive. \"I'm flattered you remember me Perry.\" Stone responded and turned to face us. If his voice seemed cold, his face was beyond frozen. There was a bunch of deep scars on his right cheek and temple and he wore a tape over his right eye. \"You can see on my face that I can't forget you even if I wish.\" Perry seemed shocked and I kept quiet, because a) there was still the gun pointing at my head and b) I was scared shitless. \"Cat got your tongue, Per?\" The cold voice asked after a while. \"Because really that would be a pity.\" Then he turned to face me. \"Oh, and Mr. Lockhart, I hope you don't mind joining us on this little trip, because that would have been rude to leave you at home alone.\" I didn't respond, because there really wasn't anything to say. \"Don't tell me you lost your voice as well?\" I only swallowed. It wasn't a clever thing to do, because when there wasn't any answer from me, the other guy - don't forget him, he's the one holding the gun - smashed my head so hard that tiny stars appeared in my vision and I knocked into the backrest in front of me. \"You don't know it's impolite to keep quiet when he's asking you something?\" Fuck. Like these guys were acting politely. I whined, because the pain in the back of my head was making me sick. \"What the hell?\" Perry yelled from his seat. \"Stone, what is this shit about? And why the fuck are you dragging Harry into this when it's only between you and me.\" Leave it to Perry to always play generous. I was scared and in pain, but the image of Perry being here alone was ten times worse (I already told you that I loved him, so you can leave your surprised glances in your pocket and just accept it) even if I was useless at most of the times and the odds of me saving the situation were really low. Stone looked at me pitifully. \"I don't know how you can put up with him,\" he pointed to Perry, \"with this asshole.\" I shrugged and was afraid of another blow for keeping my mouth shut. But nothing came this time. \"You seem confused Harry .\" He continued. \"I guess I should explain to you what happened six years ago. It might help you to understand my situation.\" If I was ever to understand his situation, it was going to be only once he would be rotting in prison. \"I wasn't always like this. Your boyfriend, Harry, cost me a lot of money and power. His investigation got me arrested and he made my car crash so now, I look like a monster and no one's giving me my eye back.\" He growled at Perry. \"Stop feeding us your shit, Stone!\" Perry said angrily. \"It's no--\" He was cut off abruptly, because Stone snapped his fingers and that made Mr. Cold-voice #2 grab me from behind in choking grip and push the gun deeper into my chin. I gasped, because the motion startled me and caught me unprepared. \"Leave him alone!\" Perry yelled and - I won't lie to you - that surprisingly made me feel all warm inside. \"Ts-ts-ts. No Perry. I'm glad I have some power over you now, because not only I want my money back, but I also want my revenge.\" \"Stone, you fucking son of bitch!\" It made me worried to hear Perry swearing like that. No sleep in the previous days was not helping and he was angry and his reactions impetuous. I wondered if this was like he felt most of the times with me around. The gun was pressed even harder into my neck. \"Watch your words big guy, or this adventure will end a bit too soon.\" Stone commented. I gulped and could hear Perry swear quietly this time. My chin hurt from the pressure so much that I thought it would break. Fuck! Why always me? It felt like being a big magnet for all the guns around. They always seemed to point at me. \"Tell me Stone, why are you not counting your days in prison like you should.\" Perry changed the theme. \"Good things happen from time to time, Per. They obviously believed that I changed and became a better person, because they released me sooner.\" He grinned in a way that was making me sick, his only eye dark and threatening. \"Then it was not hard to find you in your little hole here in L.A. And when I learned that you got yourself a little pet since the last time we met,\" he looked at me, \"my plan seemed perfect.\" He made a pause. \"Well, not only seemed, it is perfect so far.\" \"You won't get away with this, Stone. You are too stupid for that.\" I may be an idiot, but provoking our captor didn't seem as a good idea. I wanted to tell Perry, but before I could do anything, the gun was back. They were very swift if nothing else. \"Keep your mouth shut, Perry!\" Stone barked. \"Or I won't be so kind anymore.\" I couldn't turn my head, but I felt Perry fidget next to me in the seat. He murmured something unintelligible. \"Well, enough of talking, we are almost here.\" Stone snapped his fingers again and the other guy, whom I decided to call 'Snake', released me from the death grip. The gun was still pointed in my direction, but anyway I scooted closer to Perry. I felt his hand grab mine and squeeze slightly. I looked quickly around, but no one from our captors seemed to notice anything, so I sighed with relief and squeezed back. Don't boo, it really happened, okay? Oh, and I forgot to tell you that the car had blackened windows so none of us had any idea where we were heading. I had the bad feeling that this night won't be fun. After the car stopped, Snake dragged us outside and then we followed Stone inside an older building and I didn't have time to look around very much once outside, but the ride was no longer than an hour and that meant we were still in L.A. or very near. More gorillas waited for us inside. I should call them #1, 2 and 3. But it's not important for you. Just imagine all of them having two guns and also, they were a lot bigger than Perry or Stone or...whoever you can think of. \"Welcome here!\" Stone grinned. \"Please follow me.\" We both refused to move, but that seemed to be a bad idea as gorilla #1 whacked Perry's head and #2 kicked my stomach. Then we had to move, but it was more painful as a bonus. \"Careful Larry!\" Stone joked, sounding slick. \"We don't want our guests to feel bad here.\" Ha paused. \"At least before I get what I want.\" \"Fuck you!\" Perry hissed, but Stone just rolled his eyes and motioned with his hand for the thugs to lead us further. We arrived to a small room and I looked quickly around as did Perry. It appeared like some sort of office, but it wasn't used for a long time and seemed deserted apart from a few papers thrown around the floor and a big, solid desk with a broken chair in the middle. Dim lamp on the ceiling was giving enough light to see that there were no windows. Weird, scary room if you ask me. We were roughly shoved inside with Snake and the others following us. \"Let's start with the money!\" Stone barked. His fingers snapped again and that could meant only one thing. Snake was behind me in a second, holding me in a death grip once more. Great. I was already sick of being a living threat! They thrust an older laptop in front of Perry and #3 made him sit down on the broken chair behind the table. \"You have five minutes to transfer everything from your account here. You cost me a lot more, but I'll do with your humble savings. Main thing is, I don't have to wait anymore!\" Stone placed a variation of numbers on the table next to the laptop. Huh, this man must have been crazy! No way Perry was giving him his money. He was always pretty anal about his savings. I thought to myself that this was probably the first time when I was glad that there was almost nothing in my own bank account. Irony. Perry laughed like a maniac. \"Stone, someone hit you really hard into your head? I won't give you a cent!\" Wow, I was expecting many things, but not such a strong reaction, at least not in this situation. \"Oh yes, you will!\" Stone pointed his own gun at Perry's head. \"If you want to live, you will.\" He smirked. \"Who are you kidding? You want to kill me anyway.\" Perry answered coldly. \"So there's no need for me to sponsor your petty life.\" His voice was still, but I could see that he was not in his own skin. His eyes were wide and then there was the unusually quick rising and falling of his chest. With Snake's hand around my neck, I couldn't very concentrate, but the thought itself made me feel nervous. Perry seemed sraced. One flick of Stone's arm was enough for my captor to release me, but with his other hand, he smashed my head so hard that I thought it would fell off. Suddenly I was on the ground and could see only darkness for a while. \"Harry!\" Perry shouted my name and wanted to stand up probably, because I could hear a rustling sound when the chair was moved. \"Where would you like to go, Per?\" I scrambled to all four and then leaned on the wall - thank God they left me alone for a while. I saw Stone pin Perry back into his seat and then he patted the screen of the laptop. \"Changed your mind?\" He paused, grinning like mad, his black tape over the lost eye glinting in the poor light. \"Because otherwise there will be another dead body right before your own.\" \"You son of a bitch! Leave him fucking alone!\" Perry hissed. \"Perry don't--\" I was cut of with a kick to my side, so my attempt to stop him ended in a painful gasp. When I opened my eyes again, Perry had already laid his hands on the keyboard slowly and he was looking at me with anxious eyes. I had always hoped he loved me as much as I had him. This here probably counted as a proof, yet I wished it hadn't come. Another blow landed on my face. I moaned and spit out the blood which was dripping from my freshly cut lip. #1 and #3 were pointing their guns at me. Miserable was far better than how I felt. \"Well?\" Stone asked, once more piercing Perry with his intense, one-eyed gaze. Perry thew me another worried glance, but started typing frantically. I closed my eyes. Fuck , this won't end well. tbc I'm not sure when I'm going to post more, because I'm coming down with something, so it's possible I won't be able to write for a while when I'm sick. But don't worry, I will finish this! Thanks for reading![Chapter 3] Notes: I'm finally feeling a bit better today and not coughing my lungs out, so...here you go :) The laptop beeped when the message about the transaction arrived. Stone grinned, satisfied, and #2 shoved Perry away from the table, making him land on the ground next to me. \"Are you alright?\" Perry asked quietly and checked my broken lip quickly, but with the kind of affection only he's able to give. I nodded and closed my eyes. \"Oh, you two are so cute!\" Stone cheered with a false smile. \"It's a pity that you have to die.\" Okay, I thought that this man was weird, but I could believe that he wanted his money back. Now, I was just convinced that he was a dangerous psycho. I looked at Perry, but one glance told me that he was expecting this course of action from the beginning. We both scrambled up quickly and neared the wall - if it was still possible. Snake and the thugs still had their guns in our direction. I admit that I was scared to death and Perry's blanched face was not helping me at all. He touched my hand slightly and then made a step forward, getting a little bit in front of me. \"Stone, you don't really need him as he doesn't know anything. You just want your revenge at me, right?\" I never heard Perry sounding scared before, but then again it might have something to do with all the guns in direction of his head. \"Aw, that's so kind and nice from you!\" Stone barked. We didn't move and just waited for the next action. \"You know what? I'll be generous this time. After all, you've just paid me a little fortune. The fuckhead can go!\" He looked at me. \"Get lost loser. I bet you are too stupid to do anything, but if you ever try to find me or go to the police, you are dead, got it?\" I stared at him and then at Perry and felt speechless. \"Are you deaf!? Fuck off! Move out of California and forget! You can thank your 'chief' for saving your life. Say goodbye to him.\" He set the gun to Perry's temple and I saw Perry swallow with difficulty. So, I was supposed to get the fuck off, to clean the place, never come back and get lost. Yet, I couldn't. Even if I could, after one look at Perry's face it felt just impossible. I wasn't going to let him die alone in this fucking hole! I gazed at him again and saw that he had closed his eyes. Stone, on the other hand, had his eye wide open and waited for my reaction. \"No!\" I said it loudly and firmly after cleaning my throat and was proud of my solid voice. Perry looked at me worriedly at first, but before he had a chance to say anything, Stone spoke again. \"I may cry! You guys are so cute! It's really pity I have to kill you.\" He turned to me. \"Harry, sweetheart , you sure? You can still save your sorry ass, because I'm in a good temper today.\" His smile was so nasty that it ran a cold shiver down my spine - for the umptieth time that night. But I shook my head stubbornly. I may not be clever enough, but no way I was leaving alone. \"Harry, you idiot, go! Fuck off! You--\" Perry's angry outburst stopped abruptly, because there was a shot and then all I could hear was Perry's scream, which is hard to describe, but I can assure you that I'd never heard him scream like that before. The bullet you remember from the bridge in the movie was comfortable in a way, because it made him unconscious. This one just ripped his upper thigh apart. Well, not entirely apart, but you get the point. \"Shut the hell up, Per! He wants to stay, so he will, but you must excuse me now...\" Stone fished for his cell, which was ringing inside his pocket. \"Uh, important!\" He pointed to it. \"We must leave you alone for a while guys. Another business.\" He motioned with his hand and all the thugs follower him outside. \"Will be back later - we are not done Per.\" Stone hissed and closed the door behind him. Perry didn't try to reply. His face was full of pain and disgust and his eyes were glossy. Not the most pleasant view for me. As soon as I heard the door being locked from the outside, I went to my knees and scooted closer to him. The light was bright enough for me to see the big wound on his leg. Ouch. He was clutching his thigh with both hands and was groaning quietly. \"Perry!\" I moved him carefully, so his head was resting on my lap. Don't laugh! It may seem extremely schmoopy, but try to find another comfortable position for both when one is injured and in pain and the second weak and a little beaten up. He didn't respond, only continued in harsh panting. The ones of you who are making faces now, listen - when in the movie someone is shot in the leg, he would probably run around a few more hours and save the world in the process. Real life - nope. I don't have to be a doctor to know that without the healthy thigh you can hardly make a few steps while hopping around. Plus, there's a lot of fucking arteries in there so the bleeding is pretty dangerous. Got it? Good. I awkwardly patted his shoulder and wanted to lean lower to look at the wound, all the way trying to remember what Mrs. Green told us about first-aid when I was in high school. His hand on mine was unexpected and then he squeezed it. \"Harry...For God's sake get out when you can...Stone...wants me. He'll let you go...please!\" His voice broke from the pain. \"He wouldn't let me anyway. It was a game.\" Perry closed his eyes slowly. I was right and he knew it. \"Plus, I couldn't leave you there.\" I added, quietly. His breathing quickened, so I wasted no more time and moved to check his leg, still holding his hand in mine. \"I'm sorry, Harry.\" He murmured when I released the hand to rip his trousers. \"What!?\" I stopped and looked at him. His eyes were opened once more and were piercing me. \"We...won't get out of this...place.\" He paused. \"And it's my...fucking fault...as it seems.\" Tears stung my eyes. You know that it's not hard to make me cry and the situation kinda boosted the effect. Perry was quiet, so I wiped my face with my sleeve and looked down at his leg. It was a clear shot, but he was bleeding like mad and that was taking its toll. There were many drops of sweat on his forehead and he started to shiver slightly. \"You should have gotten out...\" Perry slurred almost intelligibly, his words quieter and hazy. The most horrible thing was that I knew exactly what would happen when Stone would return and I didn't like it...not a little bit. I blinked to clear my eyes and took off my belt - thank God I lost some weight during the last months - and gently, but firmly tightened it around his leg above the wound - near the groin. The bleeding seemed to subside at once, but Perry probably didn't notice. I had no idea how much blood he'd already lost, but he started coughing and the shivers were more pronounced, his face pale. \"Hey 'Slick'! Stay with me, okay?\" I commanded, remembering that I'd called him like this last Christmas after our first case and hoped it would make him feel better, but he hardly even listened to me. Looking down at my hands, messy...with his blood, I felt sick. Don't give up... \"Perry? It'll be fine.\" I crawled back behind him to support his weight. Right, you know me as a a wimp, crybaby and idiot, but I can be nice and supportive as well, okay? Just let me have some responsibility. That Perry often forgets while calling me nitwit. \"Harry...Thanks for staying.\" He sighed. That was too much even for me! I wanted my old Perry back. Anyway, he was probably just confused from the bloodloss, because only few minutes ago he'd been ordering me to get lost... I patted his forehead. \"Yeah.\" No need to tell him anything else as he was probably not very receptive at the moment. \"We're going to be fine.\" I assured him and wondered who would assure me . He made a grimace and attempted to roll his eyes. Then grunted in pain once more. I loosened the belt as it was necessary for the leg, but only for a moment, because more and more blood seemed to flow from his wound. We sat there quietly for a bunch of minutes, although it seemed more like an eternity and it must have been a pitiful glance. Perry stopped responding and was only breathing shallowly, his chest rising and falling. Suddenly, I heard rustling sounds from behind the door. Stone and his thugs must have been back! It had to wake Perry from his slumber, because his eyes opened narrowly for a while. It took a few seconds before he could orientate himself, but then he frowned and moaned in pain. \"Stone's back.\" I stated quietly. He nodded, knowing what would happen. With all his remaining power he squeezed my hand and whispered. \"Love you.\" Then Perry slipped back into unconsciousness. I had to strain my ears really hard to understand him, but what I heard broke my heart and forced new tears into my eyes. ~tbc[Chapter 4] I was fumbling with my jacket when they came back, Perry's head still on my lap. Stone entered the room with only #2 and Snake. I had no idea where he left the other two gorillas, but it didn't make any difference. Together, they had more than three guns and that was a lot. \"What a lovely sight!\" Stone exclaimed upon seeing us. I frowned and threw him a disgusted glance. \"It's a pleasure to see the big Gay Perry on the ground. Much better than the other way around.\" The thugs stayed outside the door, but were still pointing guns at us. Stone rounded the room and I followed him with my eyes, turning my head slightly. \"You know Harry, I still don't get why you didn't leave when you had a chance.\" He eyed me curiously. What kind of fucking beast was this man!? He intended to kill us from the beginning and now, instead of making it quick, he was having a small talk with me. \"That's none of your fucking business!\" I barked and looked down at Perry, who stirred slightly, but I was sure he was still unconscious. As if I could leave. \"Oh, pardon me that I asked.\" He answered with feigned sincerity. \"But tell me, are you not sick of his self-centeredness? Because when I last met him these years ago, he was acting like a big asshole.\" I didn't say anything aloud, but remembered the moment when Perry took the bullet for me while on the Dexter's case and...Well, self-centeredness really didn't suit the Perry I got to meet. \"It's very nice to chat here with you Lockhart.\" He commented even through I didn't give him one full reply for the whole time. Stone checked his watch. \"However, it's time to go and say goodbye I guess.\" He moved to the other side of the room. I grabbed Perry's hand instinctively and prepared myself for everything, but in fact I wasn't prepared at all! I didn't want to die damnit! And of course I didn't want Perry to die. Do something! My mind was nagging at me, but there really was nothing I could do to make Stone leave us alone. He bended down and opened the cabinet under the old table. When he straightened himself again, my eyes widened. I wasn't ready to die, but I thought that at least they would shoot us in the head and make it quick. What I didn't expect was seeing Stone holding a canister, a bunch of crumpled papers and a lighter. A lighter! Fuck! The psycho was going to set the room to fire! He seemed to notice my shocked expression and grinned madly. \"Unusual, isn't it? But I had to think of something special for the great Mr. Van Shrike. He wouldn't settle for anything ordinary, don't you think?\" \"You sick bastard!\" I cried and then gulped, my hands were shivering. \"Thank you for a lovely compliment.\" He smirked, enjoying the fact that he was splashing the gasoline everywhere around us. I had to cover my mouth, because the smell was overwhelming. For a while I envied Perry's blissful unconsciousness. I continued to watch Stone's quick and precious movements with wide eyes. Fortunately, there wasn't enough gas in the container to soak us and our clothes as well. When he was done, he threw the tank away and fished for the lighter inside his pocket. \"It was a pleasure to meet you, Harry. Any last wish?\" He smirked. \"Die!\" I coughed and spit at him. \"Oh, I'm afraid that I can't be of assistance. We'd have to skip this noble rule for now.\" And with that he threw the lighter into the corner. The old, rusty wallpaper caught on fire immediately and I noticed only now that the floor was made from wood. Stone put his arm in front of his mouth to filter the smoke, sent a last hating glance in direction of Perry's still form and waved hastily at me. \"Au revoir!\" Why the fuck have the bad guys always use a different languages to make an impression! The thugs moved and Stone closed the door behind himself. I heard the distant clap of the lock, but at the moment I didn't pay it much attention, because the room was filling with smoke and heat. I moved us to the most distant corner, but it wasn't very helpful, because the whole place was really small. Perry started coughing reflexively, but didn't wake up and I didn't know if I was glad for it or not. In my fantasy, death was always supposed to be something special. Like seeing things or people you haven't seen for a long time. Hearing weird voices or going towards the white tunnel...yeah you surely know all this shit, but in reality I was just sitting there, tears were flowing down my face, one hand in front of my mouth and nose, and the other grasping Perry's still one. Only thing that ran through my head were his last words to me. Then - not long after - I did hear some strange sounds after all, but otherwise there was nothing as I coughed myself into the darkness and deafening silence. END. ....?? . . . . . *evil laughter* Oookay , maybe one or two more? Let me know :)~[Chapter 5] The next thing I knew was the smell of disinfection and a bright light. Weird heaven if you ask me. Then again, who said I would end up in heaven? But it didn't feel like hell either. Truth to say, I was pretty comfortable. When I started thinking about the wonders of the afterlife, some voice interrupted me with calling my name. \"Mr. Lockhart. Wake up!\" Someone slapped my face. Auch! I suddenly wasn't so sure if I liked it there, but nevertheless opened my eyes fully. And looked directly into the face, which I didn't recognize. It belonged to a man of mine age. \"What?--\" I tried to sit up quickly, but strong hands held me down. \"Easy. Calm down.\" The voice was soothing, but for a while I had no idea where I was. There were weird tubes in my nose, but on the other hand they were making me breath a lot easier than the last time I-- It all snapped back and I panicked, trying to stand up again. Stone. Fire. Smoke. Perry! I eyed the man above me confusedly, my heart speeding up. \"Where--\" \"You are fine.\" The man cut me off. \"We are in the hospital in the ER. You were brought in a few minutes ago.\" He paused, checking my pulse and eyes. \"You have several light burns and a bad, but not severe smoke inhalation.\" He explained. \"Oh, and there's police waiting outside to talk to you.\" I didn't give a fuck about my symptoms, diagnosis, or cops...I wanted to know what happened with Perry! \"Where...\" I coughed, because speaking was obviously going to be a little bit challenging for a while. The man gave me an ice chip, which was very thoughtful. \"Where's Perry?\" I asked after swallowing it. The man only stared at me. \"Excuse me?\" I coughed again. \"Uh, the guy who was brought in with me?\" I hoped he was. \"I don't know. There's a lot of cases, but I don't remember that name...Say again?\" \"Perry.\" I said hopefully, my voice cracking just because I was breaking inside. If Perry wasn't brought in, it could mean only one thing... \"Stay here.\" The orderly said after a quick thought. \"I shouldn't do this, but I'll go and check.\" He left quickly without asking for the surname, which I forgot to add, and I was glad for it plus the curtain around my bed, because my eyes welled with tears again. The man came back a few minutes later and if he noticed the wetness on my cheeks, he didn't show it. He smiled and my heart skipped a beat. \"We have one new patient with the name Perry. This Mr. Van Shrike is in surgery now, because of his injured leg. I don't know any details, but he was in a bad condition and unconscious, yet stable when they brought him in.\" I wanted to cry again, this time from joy. \"Thanks.\" The orderly nodded and fed me another ice chip, even though my voice was cracking from a completely different reasons. \"I'll let the police in now, okay? They said it'd be just a minute.\" \"Okay.\" They asked about everything and I wished the conversation to be over soon, but on the other hand, it was one of the times when I was glad to see the cops around. One of them also told me that Stone had been arrested and that they would need me to testify. Well, whatever if it would make the fucking bastard rot in prison! After they let me alone, I was allowed to dress up and leave if I promised to go home and take it easy as there were only few scratches on my face and some burns on my hands and arms. Instead, I just went to the surgery ward to finally find Perry... Oh, I'm so sorry! You probably want to know how we got out, right? I told you in the beginning that the bad narrating won't happen again and, uh...I guess it did. Damn. Anyway, remember me fumbling with my jacket when Stone came back to us? You don't? Then go back and check, I really said it. Yeah, so I had a little device in my inner pocket. Perry calls it 'guardian angel'. He got it from his police guy and I don't give a shit about how exactly it works, but when activated, it's supposed to send an alarm message to the cops and it can be located very quickly...You get the point. It's very small, so Snake couldn't find it when he searched me and Perry in front of our home. I left it hidden in my pocket after activating it and of course, I didn't believe that it would actually call the help. I just tried it, because it was the last possibility. Then I forget about it myself while trying not to suffocate, but the little thing apparently sent enough information for the cops to find us. Geez, that's amazing! When Perry gave it to me a few months ago I didn't listen or believe to any word he said about it, but I promised to keep it by myself. Instead of the gun he'd forbid me to use. I smiled now, and caressed the thing through the fabric of my jacket. ~ tbc Extra notes: I'm not a technical type, but the thing Harry refers to really exists (try googling 'GPS SOS tracker') And I'm sure the police would have the tiniest type for tracking purposes and that would be what Perry got from his guy. Don't worry, epilogue will be Harry with Perry ;-) Thanks for reading![Chapter 6] The wait in the sterile corridor was long and unpleasant. I counted the tiles on the wall...and floor. There was another woman sitting opposite to me. She was playing with her necklace absentmindedly and I wondered for whom she was waiting. I hate hospitals and even more when I'm actually not the patient. Plus, the staff is usually rather bitchy and doesn't want you to visit people who are not your relatives. So when the surgery was over, after convincing several nurses that I was - first his husband, then his brother, or whatever - I was finally allowed to see Perry. When I found his room there was a young doctor inside. She was really good-looking. Don't forget I told you that I was still feeling more straight than gay, so yeah, she was sexy. But I had more serious concerns at hand. Perry was pale and all the little tubes made him look scary. The injured leg was propped with a soft pillow. I neared the bed slowly and she noticed my presence. \"It's not as bad as it looks.\" There was a small smile on her face. She must have spotted my anxious gaze and posture, but obviously it didn't matter to her exactly what kind of relative I was. \"Really?\" I asked, more quietly than I intended. \"He lost a lot of blood, but the wound was not serious and apart from the smoke inhalation and some second degree burns on his legs, there's no more damage. He's stable.\" I didn't give a shit about all the medical words. 'Not serious' and 'stable' did it for me. It was like to wake up from a really bad dream. \"Thanks.\" I smiled carefully, testing if it still worked after tonight. \"I'll leave you alone. He should wake up soon.\" She finished her check up of the monitors and quietly left the room. I fidgeted with my hoodie and nervously watched his chest rising and falling in peace. Then I moved closer to sit down. The chair was plastic, uncomfortable and cold, but it really didn't matter to me. I grabbed his motionless hand and caressed it with my thumb. He didn't wake up, but stirred and my heart did a little jump. I bent down and kissed him on the lips (something I wanted to do since Snake showed in front of our home), feeling overwhelmed with all the joy that the horrible night was over. After some time he finally opened his eyes and looked very confused for a few seconds. Well, duh , who wouldn't? Then he focused on me. \"Harry?\" His voice was croaky and I remembered the ice chip I'd been given for it. There was a glass on the bed table so I spooned some ice and fed it to him. I also squeezed his hand and smiled. \"Yeah.\" \"Are we dead?\" He asked slowly after swallowing. \"Nope.\" I grinned. \"But Stone...\" He paused. \"Harry, are you alright?\" See? He calls me an idiot and bitches about my faults, but he really cares. Instead of a reply, I bent down to hug him and I nodded into his shoulder. Wires were making it harder, but he put his free hand on my back and patted me. I was near to crying again. \"How..?\" He asked once we separated. \"Remember 'Guardian angel'? Uh, I guess it really works after all. I activated it when Stone went away.\" Perry succeeded in an attempt to roll his eyes. \" Of course it works.\" The squawking of his voice only made the statement funny. \"Well, um..I had it in my pocket all the time, but forgot about it.\" I admitted. \"Because you're an idiot.\" Perry quipped, but it hurt me more than it should have. I started standing up, feeling bad again. Before I could escape, there was a hand around my wrist. \"Wha--\" He looked into my eyes. \"Thanks.\" I tilted my head, not believing my own ears. \"For saving us.\" Perry added and tugged at my hand. I grinned. \"I told you that some day it would happen! I was--\" He cut me off again. \"Harry? Shut the hell up and come here.\" We hugged once more and I stayed longer than necessary nestled up to his chest when I heard him murmur softly... \"Love you.\" And it felt million times better than when he last said these words to me. End. (For real ;-) I hope you enjoyed this last bit of fluff...and the whole story! ","Summary":" You won't catch me unprepared this time! No bad narrating will happen, because I'm checking it over"},{"Movie":"Fox and the Hound","Title":"It Should've Been Me","Author":"Evil-Copper","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12202110","Passage":"[Chapter 1] (Authors note: Hi all, sorry for this, this... not really sure what to call it, but I was given this as a request off Sofurry so I just wanted to start this and make the title mine. This is an AU to the original film, where Chief is hit by a train, trying to catch Tod. I'm not doing to spoil it yet. I'm hoping to make this my longest story yet, but I'm not going to update it on a schedule. Please fav/follow, and please review and let me know how I can improve it. Now, enjoy.) \"Acceptance is the best form of forgiveness.\" Evil-Copper \"Look Big Mama, Copper's back,\" Tod excitedly said as he came to a hold along side the old owl on a fence. His winter had taken to long without his friend, so his rejoice was expected, and once the hound came into his line of sight, he couldn't help but be surprised at his size \"Heh, boy has he grown big.\" The fox was aware that time changes the way one looks, but hadn't yet felt the effect of time on somebody's character. Widow Tweed had shown her undying love for him, no matter if he was a few weeks old, or just under a year. Big Mama had always been there for him, even when he thought she had left during the snowy season. But Copper, on the other hand, had changed in ways his worst nightmares would never had predicted. Big Mama gave a small chuckle in response. She was vigilant to the relationship between the unlikely pair of friends, and was worried about the closest thing she had to family. So, she decided to slowly swop the topic around, \"Ah huh, hehe, and look at that big pile o' skins he helped track down.\" She directed her wing to the trailer filled with fur skins off various animals. \"I know Big Mama, he's a huntin' dog now.\" \"Your right, and you're a fox,\" Big Mama's usually cheerful persona seemed to be missing, but was replaced with a more stern response. \"Ah, that won't make any difference,\" the fox sharply responded. Trying to convince himself more then her, he said, \"Copper's gonna be glad to see me.\" \"Well Honey, just don't get your hopes too high...\" Her sentence was cut short by an impatient Tod. \"Look, don't worry, I'll be careful. I'll go over tonight when Chief and the hunter are sound asleep.\" (Authors note: Once again, this is only a draft and will be altered slightly. Please fell free to give some constructive criticism and idea's on how to re-write this part. This will be on hold until Late November-early December due to exams. The rest of the chapters will be much longer.)[Chapter 2] (Authors note: Hi all, sorry for the long wait. This chapter will be longer then the first. Enjoy. PS: My first ever first person piece of writing is in here, please don't kill me if it isn't the best) \"Time can heal ones past, but will take away the present. Without a present, there can be no future.\" Evil-Copper As night approached, a cool breeze picked up and the long awaited reunion drew closer. Tod anxiously waited for Widow Tweed to open the door as she would every night. Creaking from the front door soon stole the foxes attention and set it on the darkening outside world. He knew that Big Mama's eyes would be on him, so once his paw crossed through the doorway, there would be no turning back. Once he was outside, Tod gave his eyes a chance to adjust before he began his journey. He set off, but only managed a few paces before his attention was stolen for the second time. Only now, it was set on a rustling noise coming from a tree. A sound of fluttering wings could only mean one thing. \"Good evenin' Tod,\" greeted Big Mama as she floated down and landed on the fence. \" I see you still think that hound dog is your friend.\" \"Please no. Not this again.\" \"Honey, I know I won't be able to change your mind, so all I want to say is good luck and be careful.\" The owl started to sound like Widow Tweed. \"Just remember what I told you.\" \"Well, thanks for understanding. I'll see you later,\" Tod said as he vanished into the night. His impatience was getting the best of him, he didn't even wait for any sort of response. The journey had taken very little time, and before Tod could even think of how he was going to approach his best friend, he had reached the fence. A closer look at his, now grown up, best friend brought up many memories. Usually they were all happy and about the two of them swimming, but a slightly darker memory seemed to dull the rest out. Flashback: Tod's P.O.V Looking up at the various shapes, sizes and shades of fur dangling in the shed, I felt my young body fill with sorrow. I had yet to discover the world's cruelty, but the premature finding had made me think of a darker possibility. My mouth opened as the words seemed to effortlessly roll off my tounge, \"W-Why that's awful. Those poor things.\" I lowered my head as I refused to look at the horrible sight before me. The next thing I know, my body was being gently squeezed by the owl beside me, \"I'm sorry, Tod.\" As I nuzzled into Big Mama's chest, I couldn't stop my ears from perfing up as she started to talk, \"Honey, Copper's gonna come back a trained huntin' dog, a real killer.\" I shook my head in disbelief, \"Oh no, not my friend Copper,\" I stopped shaking my head to look sure of my statement, \"He'll never change.\" \"I hope you're right, Tod\" \"And we'll keep on being friends forever. Won't we Big Mama?\" Opening her wings and sitting me down in front of her, I got the indication of how serious this moment would be. Looking me straight in the eye, the old, wise owl recited words which would etch themselves in my mind forever. \"Darling, forever is a long, long time, and time has a way of changing things.\" End of flashback T.P.V. Tod rounded the corner, unaware that Copper had heard and caught his scent. The fox tiptoed over to the hound, \"Copper,\" he called out, trying to be loud enough to call get his friend and not his enemies attention. \"Pst, hey Copper.\" Once he saw his friend stand up, he suddenly realized he looked different from their last encounter, \"It's me, Tod.\" A smile seemed to grow on the hounds face, \"I thought that was you, Tod, I heard you comin'.\" Taking a second to look over his friend, the hound found his size a surprise, \"Boy, you've really grown.\" \"You have too, Copper. I saw you come back with Chief and the hunter.\" Copper's face the changed to one more thoughtful. He knew what he had to say, yet he didn't want hurt his childhood friend. He had no choice, \"It's great to see you, Tod...\" Snorts from the sleeping Irish Wolfhound cut him short, \"but, yea know you, you shouldn't be over here.\" Copper's face changed yet again, but this time to one with more seriousness, \"You-You're gonna get us both into a lot of trouble.\" \"Hey look I, I just wanted to see yea. We're... We're still friends, aren't we?\" The question surprised Copper. Now, he had to make a split second decision which would change his life forever, \"Tod... Those days are over. I'm a huntin' dog now.\" Tod's mouth opened in shock and disbelief. His best friend destroyed a relationship which was as strong as Chief's rope. Never before has the year-old fox been dealt such an emotional blow. His instincts were telling him to run, but he had become paralysed in pain. He lowered his ears as the broken friendship descended upon him. Seeing Tod in such and emotionally vulnerable state intently put a mask of sorrow on Copper's face. He began to regret his decision, but knew it was for the best. Realizing that he had nothing left to say, he tried to scare Tod off, \"You... You better get outa here before ol' Chief wakes up.\" The fox did nothing to hide his pain, \"Oh Chief, uhh, he doesn't worry me.\" Neither of the two noticed that the old Wolfhound was waking up. \"Tod, I'm serious. You're... You're fair game as far as he's concerned.\" Before Tod had a chance to reply, Chief was up and barking at the fox. The only thing holding him back was the rope tied to his collar. All the commotion had reached Amos Slade's ears. He stood at the door with his 410 shotgun firm in hand. He looked in disbelief at the one fox who always evaded him, \"It's that fox again!\" Tod ran off into the forest as Amos lined up his target for a shot and fired. He missed. With that He untied his dog's and ran off in pursuit of the orange furred animal. (Authors Note: So, what did you think? Sorry if it's a bit rushed, but I had a small break and decided to take it. I'm unsure of when the next chapter will be up, but I'm hoping it's soon. Please review.)[Chapter 3] (Authors note: Hi all. I'm back. Guess what?... Exams are over! I should have the chapters updated quicker then before but until then, Enjoy my latest chapter. Last time, we saw the Copper had told Tod about his unfortunate feelings towards the two of them being friends, Chief woke up and ran off into the night with Amos and Copper in pursuit of Tod. This is where the twist comes in.) (PS: Sorry but my VCR machine had played its last movie, so if some of the parts are off, please forgive me) \"Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations.\" Author unknown The chase was intense, and took part all over the forest. Tod's small body and quick leg's gave him a speed and agility advantage, allowing him to keep the lead. Chief's vast knowledge and undeniable experience in the forest meant that he was mostly able to keep up. A high jump had became an obstacle that they both had to conquer. Tod knew he would be able to make it, but Chief, on the other hand, was not nearly as nimble or fit as he used to be. For the young fox, it was a matter of three quick and easy jumps to reach the top. For the Irish Wolfhound, it was a lot more time consuming, and after a good few seconds, he found himself on all four's as he charge after his quarry. By the time Tod had the train tracks in sight, he had opened up a fairly big gap. His short celebration soon died as he remembered he had a new threat. This threat was none other then Amos Slade's new number one hunting dog, Copper. With Chiefs barking drawing nearer, Tod knew he had to disappear, and fast. So, without looking back, the fox turned left and vanished behind a pile of neatly stacked wood. It was mere seconds later when Chief ran past, unaware of the foxes detour. As the sound of frantic barking was cast further and further, a panting Tod chanced a peek. He stuck his head out from the gap underneath the wood, and faced where Chief had ran. He was gone. *sniff, sniff* The sound broke his investigation. Once he realized that Copper had not run past, he pulled his head back in and waited. The sniffing drew closer and Tod became more anxious. Then, it happened. A set of four tan brown legs became visible. The legs were accompanied by Copper's face. His nose was planted to the ground and his eyes fixed on the path ahead. He continued to walk until he was out of sight, that is, only momentarily. Tod soon caught sight of his old friend, only this time, Copper had caught sight of him too. The hounds face was stern, causing the fox to backtrack. \"Copper, Copper!\" The hoarse voice of Amos Slade rang grasped the hounds attention. Copper swung his head around and saw that his master was fast approaching, the 410 shotgun still in hand. He turned to look down at Tod. The foxes sad, desperate expression seemed enough to make the bloodhound think twice about hunting his old best friend. \"Tod, I... I don' wanna see yea get killed\" \"Track 'im down boy!\" Amos shouted out. Copper swung his head around momentarily. He shook his head as he deliberated on something. He had to do this for Tod. He may have destroyed their friendship, but he was not about to help and his friend . Turning to face the fox again, he said, \"I... I'll let you go this one time.\" Hastily, Copper ran passed a pile of wood and gave a long loud howl, signalling Amos of his misleading scent. \"Don't lose him!\" the old hunter shouted as he ran after the hound. The pair then disappeared into the forest. Tod watched as the pair ran off, and found his cue to make a run for it. He climbed out from under the wood and swung round to make it to the tracks. The fox knew that it track ran past the Tweed farm, but he also knew it was out in the open. As he ran along the track, a grey figure jumped out from behind a rock. The growling grey figure was Chief. (PS: This is where the AU starts) \"Hehe, I got yea this time,\" Chief said with a grin on his face. He inched closer, causing the fox to backtrack, \"One whole year to finally get yea!\" \"C-Come on, Chief. We-we can sort tis out without violence, can't we?\" Tod said, fear evident in his voice. The only response he received was a low growl. Just past the waters edge, a weird vibration stole Tod's attention. Chief didn't seem to notice, when the fox looked up, he saw a horrible sight. Bright lights came up behind Chief and an unmistakable clatter filled the air. It was a sign of a train. \"Chief! Look out!\" Shouted Tod , but the arrogant Wolfhound thought of this as a diversion. He stood his ground. Realizing that Chief wasn't about to move, Tod sprinted towards him and kicked him onto a nearby bridge and soon after felt something extremely hard hit his body at high speed. An excruciating pain swept through his body, as if he had fallen off Widow Tweed's barn roof onto a anvil. He found himself falling, with what felt like concrete knobs, hitting against his body as he rolled down the hill. And then, darkness. (Authors note: Please fave/follow or review. I have the next chapter set up, but I don't have the energy to do it now. but it should be up in about a week.)[Chapter 4] (Author's note: Howzit going. As I promised, a chapter in the space of seven days. Thanks to the guest for the review, I just hope this chapter answers your hope. Last time, Chief had chased Tod before losing him. His old friend Copper had thrown Amos off his trail. hen Tod tried to make a break for it, he was confronted by Chief, whom he later saved at the near cost of his life. Warning: This chapter can be seen as saddening and contains graphic descriptions that may upset younger viewers (not smut). If you don't mind gore, you can continue. If you do, you can still continue but then please don't complain to me. PS: Tod is a smaller animal compared to Chief, so please don't tell me that he would've only had a broken leg.) \"In the end we only regret the chances we never took.\" Author unknown \"You know, You've got one lucky fox, Widow. His injuries should've passed him on,\" said a man dressed in white and green. The man was well known around these parts for caring about wild animals, and he was particularly fond of the old ladies pet. Widow Tweed gasped at the new information, causing Tod to wake up. His eyes were a flutter of blinks before they adjusted to his new, yet old, surroundings. He was back in his home, and was laying on the kitchen table. He tried to lift his head to get a better view, but was abruptly halted by an unbelievably scorching sensation in his neck and upper back. Instead of trying to ride the pain out, the fox gently lay his aching head down again and decided to listen in on the humans. \"Dr Mulligan, do you mean to tell me that my fox should be dead?!\" Widow half shouted in disbelief. \"Yes. I mean, its quite obvious. He has a broken leg, a badly sprained paw and a few torn muscles. He even has a gash on his head.\" The pair stood up from the living room and made their way to the kitchen, where they found Tod's eyes were open. \"Oh Tod,\" Widow said in relief as she leaned down to hold her fox. A pained yip escaped Tod's muzzle as his adopted mother squeezed him too tight for comfort. Letting go of him, the widow thanked Dr Mulligan and showed him out. Meanwhile, inside, Tod's mind was an undesirable mess of confusion. He had many questions, but his vague memory only answered a few of them, 'This... this is a mess. Looks like I'm stuck for a few more weeks at home. Broken leg, sprained paw torn muscles and a hole in my head. No wonder why I smell blood. How did I get here? I remember being cornered by Chief, but that's about it. Argg, Copper. No, no, no, what have you done? I need to... Ouch!... ow-ow-ow-oowww, that hurts'. Tod found himself being lifted into the air, his muzzle was a blur as he yipped in pain. \"Oh, oh, it's alright dear,\" Widow said in the hopes that it would comfort him for the short journey to his basket, which it didn't. It wasn't long before Widow gingerly lay him down in his basket. moments later, the fox's exhausted body fell asleep. Back at Amos Slade's farm, the mood was nothing short of gloomy. Amos may have been glad that he had finally bid good riddance to Tod and Chief may have been glad of no longer having to chase the fox down, But Copper felt completely overwhelmed with guilt. Not only had he destroyed his friendship with Tod, he also did nothing to help him. While Amos celebrated inside, Chief and Copper lay bitterly in their respective bails. Neither one of them wanted to look at one another, yet they knew they had to work this out. If not, it would only make things worse. Copper lay with dams in his eyes. He knew his friend was either dead, or close to it. 'Why? Why does it have to end like this?' The tears built in his eyes had now begun rolling don his tan brown cheek. 'Tod, I-I'm so sorry. I-I shouldn't have said the things I did.' His nose became runny and sobbing hiccups filled the air. 'He'll never forgive me.' As Copper's weeping became louder, Chief's attention shifted to the bloodhound. The Irish Wolfhound had been quiet since the incident, purely out of shock. Never had he witnessed a hunting dog's quarry ever saved their hunter, that is, until now. What really stunned him, was not the fact that Tod had sacrificed himself for the safety of his hunter, but was the fact that his worst enemy had save him. Turning to face the bloodhound he had come to call his own, he couldn't help but feel like the source of his pain, 'Sonny, this ain't how it was meant ta' be. There ain't nobody who could'a told us 'bout that train.' Chancing a comforting chat, Chief decided he would see what he could do, \"Sonny?\" Without turning to face his adopted father, he coldly responded, \"What do you want?\" By this time, his tears had subsided. \"Look, I gotta few things I need yea ta' know. Copper, I wanna say sorry. I didn't see how close you was to that fox. Had I know, I wouldn't 'ave given chase.\" \"Yeah, right\" \"Second, there ain't no way we coulda' known 'bout the train...\" \"Oh would yea stop lying!\" Copper said as he looked over at the Wolfhound, \"I could hear it commin' from where I was, I-I even heard Tod warn you!\" His voice showed anger that Chief had never witnessed before, \"You keep trying to treat me like a pup! You tell me what I can't do and who I can't be friends with! And do yea know what the worst part is?\" Copper asked as he stood up with tears rolling down his cheeks again. He looked Chief straight in the eye. \"You're never satisfied. Yea always got this disappointed look in your eyes, as if all I ever do is disappoint you. But don' worry, it won't be a problem anymore.\" Without thinking twice, Copper turned around and ran off into the night. Chief just sat there, his soul marinating in guilt. He never knew the full extent of his actions. The only thing going trough Chief's mind, was a thought he had only had once before. The thought was the one thing he would've hoped to never ever have again. 'It Should've been me' (Author's note: Well, now. Time for some unfortunate news. The next chapter will take a while, as I am trying to complete my other Fox and the Hound story. I know there will be some people out there who will be saying, 'it's not hard to do a few stories at the same time' . I don't have complete access to my computer, so I write a draft the old fashion way. Pencil and Paper. Please fave/follow and even better, review. Until next time.)[Chapter 5] (Authors note: Hi all. Sorry for the wait, but I'm sure you know how hectic the festive season gets. Which reminds me, HAPPY NEW YEAR! I know I'm late, but don't worry about that. Thanks to all the favorites/followers and the reviews from Faith, Guests and disnefangirl774. Warning: Beginning has descriptive thought of suicide. Last time, we saw just how badly Tod was injured by the train, as well as the emotional blow it gave to Copper. In this chapter, things might be a little better. But for who?) \"It is necessary for me sometimes just to be alone and quiet.\" Charles Bukowaki The rustling of leaves and seemingly weightless paws thumping on the ground were the only things that made a sound. The cold air racing into a pair of bloodshot eyes, eyes that seemed to be accustomed to the flow of tears streaming down the once happy face. Tonight seemed a lot darker and colder then the ones before, causing the running animal to run longer that what would normally be possible. But, alike all runners, you can never out run pain. Copper had become exhausted from always running. Running from things he knew he could not change. His body soon gave a last mighty push as it slowed to a dead stop. The shaky legs screaming in agony from the miles of nothing but pure sprinting. His breathing was heavy and deep, deep enough for two. His face, a bank in which a river runs, was now as wet as when he swam with his... with an animal he once cared deeply for. Minutes past, allowing the hound to catch his breath, as well as allowing memories to catch him. His heart felt as if it were being carved in two. \"No. He's... He's gone,\" Copper's raspy voice relayed the thoughts he most feared. \"He's gone. And it's all my fault. I shoulda' stopped him. I...\" His train of thought was interrupted by the sound of rapidly flowing water. He raised his head and looked around, only to find he was at a spot he would never forget. He was staring down at a stream. And dead ahead, was the bridge. He walked over the edge and further onto the bridge. His pain was too much to bare. He looked to the spot he had last seen his old friend and spoke, \"Tod, I... I'm really sorry I couldn't help yea. Now though, it's too late. I can't even see your body anymore. I... It's my fault. ALL OF IT! And there's only one way to make it right.\" With that, Copper took a deep breath and let his body fall forward over the side and down into darkness. But not soon enough it would seem, as an animal of the same size jumped and connected with the falling hound. A pained yipe escaped Copper's mouth as he somehow landed on a ledge with his savior wrapped around him. Pained cries were barely contained from the two lumps of fur. Copper opened his eyes. The only white light he saw, was that of the moon. He looked over and faced his requested savior, only to find him struggling to stand up. It may have taken longer to recognize the grey long haired Wolfhound, but rather predictably, he was reveled to be the one who had helped him escape. Chief. \"Chief, Wha... What are yea doing here?\" Copper asked in a surprised voice. It was unusual for his adopted father to run away from home, and yet he now stood before Copper. \"What d' yea think I'm doin' here? Copper, yea 'onestly think I'd just let yea walk off to die?\" Chief said sternly. \"I... I dunno anymore,\" \"Look, I ain't ever gonna let yea do tha'. Copper, yea have to listen to me. I may not care for much no more, but yea can bet your barrel on me caring for yea.\" Chief looked down at Copper, waiting for him to sit up. If he was going to do this, he would want it done seriously. The old hound loathed the idea of sharing such delicate information to any of his two trusted family members. As Copper sat up, the sun began rearing its mass around, and the sky became a little more orange with every passing second. The air now poke of a second day, a day in which new opportunities would arise and new choices could be made. Now, however, none of that mattered. There was a more pressing matter that had to be resolved. Chief decided to start this as soon as possible, because once it was over, they could return home, \"Sonny, if I didn't care for yea, why would I help yea become something better them me? Why would I give yea some o' my food when the master gave yea to little? It's not just because I care for yea, but it's cause we're... Your the closest thing i ever had to family.\" \"Chief, what about the master?\" \"He is family, but it's kinda hard to talk with someone who can't understand yea. Listen, I'll tell yea what, lets get home, have a couple days rest, and if yea really want, we can go back to being normal?\" \"Can we scuffle?\" \"Maybe,\" And with that, the pair looked down to the spot where Tod lay. Copper knew it was wild to think about his late friend so soon, but he still wanted to know one thing, \"If you knew, would you've listened?\" Chief knew this was a sincere question, and one he should take into deep consideration. Copper knew he didn't like the fox one bit, but now that he understood, what would he say? \"Yea,\" was his only response. With that, the two found a dusty path to the surface and a track all the way home. (Authors note: So, that was unexpected. I really had a problem putting this chapter together, but now, it's done. Some bad news for the readers. This story will have to be put on temporary hold while I adjust to the new grade and also, I've had a few requests for a sequel of my first FATH fanfic 'The Past And The Present.' Now, that does not mean that this will be off the radar, I'll work on it as often as I can. Thanks very much for the support and for more information, please read the last chapter of 'The Past And The Present') Until we meet again. Cheers ;}[Chapter 6] (Authors Note: Hi all, It's yet another chapter of you favorite story. First off, I just want to say that Faith, I'm sure this chapter will answer your last review, but I can see why it might have been confusing. Copper and Chief merely thing that he is dead, but he will be at home, recovering day by day. Secondly, Thank you all for all the follows, faves and reviews. Now, in the last chapter, Copper's depression and overall anger took a hold of him, almost sending him into self destruct mode, but lucky for him, Chief was there to save him. Warning: slight graphical descriptions in the beginning may upset some readers. Enjoy the latest chapter. A big thanks to disneyfangirl774 for pointing out a few mistakes and the review.) \"Sometimes it's easier to pretend that you don't care, than to admit it's killing you.\" Author unknown As the morning sun slowly devoured the remaining darkness of the night sky, the day seemed sure to be better than the one before. The sound of birds singing filled the air with musical notes which seeped into the old farm house, stirring a slumbering fox. His mind was awake, yet the rest of his body did not follow suit. The previous night's accident had been an adrenaline filled roller-coaster ride, leaving Tod to suffer from exhaustion and pain, immense pain, pain that the devil himself would regret to inflict on anyone. He lay down for another ten minutes before his eyes fluttered open and allowed light into his dark eyes. He lay motionless, not daring to move an inch. His neck had calmed down to the point where he could lay without discomfort. His lazy eyes scanned the room in search of his adopted mother, who was sitting in the kitchen preparing hot water for her laundry. Widow too had calmed down, and although she knew it was something she could not help the pain, she still felt obliged to keep her fox as happy as possible. She turned around and looked over to the limp fox, her heart ached every single time she looked over at once orange fur now painted in crimson, his broken leg laying in a cast, his awkwardly positioned paw. It seemed almost too much to bear, but his soul was still present, and that's all that mattered. She then looked up to inspect his head, only to have the idea washed away by his open, longing eyes. \"Oh, Tod. You're awake.\" She said loud enough to excite her fox, who began waving his tail in bliss with disregard to the pain. At the Slade Farm, the mood was slow and the air seemed light. The bird's songs could be heard from the neighboring farm, giving the air some type of uplifting. Copper resting in his barrel, trying to take his mind off his best friend, but it did little to no help. The wind was dead, which allowed the smell of booze to hang around as Amos lay passed out in his room. Copper, however, didn't care. His mind was focused on something more painful. His best friend's dead still body remained etched in his mind. As his boredom crept in, he seemed to dig deeper into his memory. 'Friends forever' Such powerful words had never meant so much, and yet were said so easily. He knew it would take a while before things returned to normal, so for now, he would have to try his best not to give in to his painful memory. Copper then looked over at the Wolfhound next to him. His facial expression was unusual. No anger, no disappointment, and no happiness. The only thing any soul would have seen was a hound, whose face showed pure remorse for his past actions. His actions were not by any chance good, and yet if not for the cold actions, he would've realized that this friendship was one as sacred as the master's shotgun. Something which should never be messed with, converted or disturbed at all. This may have been against mother nature's will, but her kind nature seemed to cradle the pair until now. Now father time was the only one left who could help soothe the wounds. Chief woke up, slowly raising his head to look over at his adopted son. The short sleep seemed to have allowed them both some time to realize that life was never going to be the same again. Copper soon stood up to walk over to his adopted father, unable to hide the fact hat he was in emotional pain. The Wolfhound knew that this was a difficult time for the younger Bloodhound, and instead of chasing him off, allowed him to squeeze into the barrel barely big enough for one of the large dog's. Copper began sobbing into Chiefs fur. His night was horrible, and now, he finally had someone who he could warm up to, show his emotions to and share his pain with. (Author's Note: Sorry if this chapter came out a lot shorter than normal, but I decided to just inch it forward, piece by piece. So, please Follow/Favorite and review. Until next time.)[Chapter 7] (Author's note: Hi again. I'm back with another chapter of It Should've Been Me . I realize it has been a while since I last updated this, but I've had other stories and school to deal with. A big thanks to all my reviewers, faves and followers for the continued support, and I hope this chapter fills the craving for the next chapter. Last time, we saw just how bad Copper had been hit by the events, as well as Widow and Tod's condition. We pick up the action in the Tweed Farm barn.) \"Life isn't about finding yourself. It's about creating yourself.\" Author unknown. ' Finally, some fresh air,' Tod thought to himself as he lay in his basket, which was now set in the center of the barn. His accumulated injuries did not allow him to get off lightly. He was under the complete care of the old widow. Widow Tweed was unimaginably horrified by the injuries her fox had received, and even more sorrowful for his lack of mobility. She could move him around in his wooden basket, but that was where her help ended. Laying in the comfortable basket, the feeling of fresh wind blowing through his hair was more refreshing then a jump in the waterhole as opposed to sitting in the house. The morning air, accompanied by the warm spring sun, was enough to cause his injured state to become nothing more then an inconvenience. Widow sat not too far away, milking Abigale to make up for her being forgotten in the daily chores. At least it gave her fox a chance to sit outside. Staring at Tod, the old widow was unsure of how to react. Was it something which was meant to happen? Was this inevitable? She was unable to answer any of the multiple questions popping into her mind. The crimson glistening on his fur was something which she could not bare to see. She then looked back at the task at hand, milking old Abigale. A flutter of feather's filled the cool air as Tod was about to take a nap. He raised his tired head, almost working muscles he should not, and stared at he shadows cast before him. One was that of a old bird, with the wing span of about the biggest he had yet scene. On the one side, was the shadow of a tall bird, not as big as the center one, and on the other, was a shadow which did not reach the basket. It was almost instantly confirmed. \"Goodmornin', Tod, Honey,\" Big Mama said as she kept her distance, expecting the fox to run towards her, but he never did. \"Tod, what's the matter with you, huh? Are you sick? Too tired to come and greet us now?\" Dinky's distinctive voice said as he began to slowly bounce toward the laying animal in front of him. \"Oh my g-g-g-gosh Tod, what happened?\" Bommer said as he walked up to Tod, seeing he dried blood on his fur, along with the cast around his leg. \"W-who did this?\" \"Nobody di...\" \"I'm gonna sort them out for yea kid, me and everyone I know. We gonna...\" Dinky was interrupted by the old owl. \"Dinky, give the child some chance to explain.\" Big Mama said as she opened her wing to shut the Finch up. She may have had patience with her boys, but not enough for a time like this. Her motherly guard over the two birds seemed to help her keep them silent. \"Thanks, Big Mama. Now, before yea say anythin', I don't wanna hear any 'I told yea so,' or 'yea shoulda' listened, Tod.' Deal?\" Tod asked with a strain as he slowly sat up, almost collapsing from the unusual sensation of his sprained paw. The three could easily see that the young fox was in pain, and clearly not in the mood for any remarks. They all nodded their heads in unison. \"Well, yea know I was friends with Copper, the Bloodhound, when I was a kid? I went over to say hi when he came back from the huntin' trip, and...\" \"And he decided you should be his game, right?\" Dinky piped in as he was confident in what he believed was the truth. \"No, no, no. He tried to tell me that we weren't gonna be friends anymore? I was too shocked to realize that Chief was waking up. He, with Amos and Copper, begun chasing me as if I was the hunt. I pulled a slight lead over Chief, but Copper soon found me. H-he tried to help me...\" Tod shifted his body into a more comfortable position, moaning in pain from his sustained injuries. His broken leg allowed for little movement, and his torn muscles were of no help either. He may have moaned a fair amount, but none of the whimpering sounds reached Widow's ears. Now, laying back down, he continued his story as the trio of birds inched closer with each word. \"I ran off down the train tracks shortly after Copper gave his master a false scent. I had just reached the tracks when Chief jumps out from nowhere. I backed up, trying to keep some distance while I tried to talk him out of it. Then, it came.\" \"W-w-w-what came?\" Boomer asked in utter curiosity. \"The train.\" \"What happened after that?\" Big Mama inquired, purely out of worry, although she was well aware of his current state. \"I tried to warn him, hoping to chase him so I could run off. I'll tell yea, It's like trying to shout at the waterfall, asking it to flow upstream. So, I ran to him, kicked him onto a nearby bridge, and I got hit. Next thing I know, I'm at home with torn muscles, sprained paw, broken leg and a hole in my head,\" Tod said as he lowered his head to show the dried scab where the whole was. \"WO! We don't wanna see tha',\" Dinky shouted as he raised his wind to cover his eyes. Once he was sure that Tod had stopped showing his head wound, he lowered his wing and looked straight at his fox friend. \"Does Copper or Chief know your alive?\" Tod had to think carefully. Up until now, he tried to keep himself focused on his healing, completely blocking out all thoughts of the pair that hunted him. He tried looking at it from both angles. The mere thought of Copper suffering from the death of him almost caused the fox to shed a tear. Then, remembering what the Bloodhound had said to him, \"Tod... Those days are over. I'm a huntin' dog now.\" He realized that this would be the end. He no longer had a friend, only enemies. Before Big Mama could probe Tod for information, the sound of a dropping metal bucket drew their attention to Widow Tweed. The widow angrily chased off the trio who were there for her fox. \"Shooo, get gone you pesky birds,\" Widow begun to swing the broom in her hand, waving it just shy of the birds, causing the to take flight from the fright. Within seconds, the only trace of the birds were a few scattered feathers. now, Tod was left with a cold hearted answer nobody would have guessed. His pained mind could only think the words his stiff jaw would not allow him to say. \"I don't care anymor'. They are dead to me.\" (Author's note: So, how was that? Not too bad I think, considering my time absent. Anyway, please fave/follow and review your enjoyment for this story. Thanks for reading and I'll see you all again soon.)[Chapter 8] (Authors note: Hi everybody. I am sorry for yet another long wait but I'm almost back on track. Thanks to all my readers, followers, favourites and reviewers for the continuous support and motivation. This chapter is the restart of my writing.) \"Unanswered questions are far less dangerous than unquestioned answers.\" Author unknown Days form a part of time, and as time roles on, life changes. Wounds begin to heal and feelings slowly fade, but in this forest, time stood still. These days faded away, endlessly giving birth to new days only to be take by the dark night. It had been days since the accident occurred, yet the wounds ceased to heal. Although Tod may have been healing, with only his leg and scars remaining injured, his soul seemed empty. His life was dull. However, that would all change by a chance arrival. The arrival of someone who would turn this poor foxes small world upside down. As Tod sat in the living room, his mind began to wonder. These small trails of thought seemed to bug the young fox as they somehow became more and more intriguing, closer and closer to a question he has been asking himself for a while. \"Who am I and where did I come from? I only remember inside the farm. I wish I had some information as to what happened. Big Mama refuses to tell me, and I can't speak human. I don't know what else to do...\" Suddenly, barking in the distance broke the fox's deep thought. His ears may have been be deceiving him, but the barking seemed loud, almost too loud. He's experience with Chief and the train seemed to have taken it's toll on him. The sound was more painful than his leg. And yet, his curiosity seemed interested in what was happening. As the barking became louder, it was clear that only one hound was after something. One hound. A thought Tod took as to good to be the truth. Leaping onto the couch, he carefully raised his injured leg as he tried to see what was unfolding. What he saw confused but angered him to no end. Outside, the hound on the chase was non-other than Chief, and his quarry was an old fox. A vixen whose greyed red coat seemed to shine in the morning sun. The vixen was of age, that seemed obvious, and yet she moved in a way which masked her years, only revealing it in long sprints. Tod wanted to help, and so he lowered himself back to he ground and made for the door. Widow left a small gap for air, but the space was big enough for the fox to escape into the outdoors. Once outside, he limped his way to the now cornered vixen. Her hackles raised and ears flattened. Her body poised for a quick getaway, with her teeth bared, ready for the inevitable fight. Chief had his eyes set on the vixen, not wanting her to escape. His facial expression showed determination, the kind which could not be stopped. Rustling leaves somehow had taken the Wolfhounds attention, and once he caught sight of the other fox, his mind stopped. His body tensed up and his attack ready face slowly faded, allowing room for confusion. \"Tod?\" Chief asked in disbelief as the fox limped closer. He stepped back as Tod started growling. His anger was justified, and Chief knew it. \"I can't belie...\" Chief was shut down as the young fox stopped mere inches from the pair. The vixen saw this as the opportunity to leave. She slowly walked around to stand behind Tod. With the vixen behind him, Tod slowly turned around and limped off without looking back. The vixen decided to follow her rescuer as far as possible. \"Tod's alive, but it can't be. There was nothin' left of him. I gotta see more of this.\" Chief thought as he watched the pair disappear into the farm house. He snuck over to the window where he could get a good view. As the door shut behind the pair, Widow took an opportunity to check in on her fox, only to find that he had a visitor. \"Tod, is this a friend of yours?\" Tod looked up at the old widow, longing to tell the truth, but his inability to speak with humans prevented any futile actions. His eyes, however said enough to convince her that the vixen was not going to be a problem. So she left the pair in peace. The old vixen slowly watched over Tod as he limped back over to his basket, clearly unhappy. His face was hung low and his body dropped soon after finding it's mark, followed by a heavy sigh. The vixen had no idea what was running through his head, but the one thing she did know was that he knew the hound chasing her. \"Tod, is it? Well, I want to thank you for saving me back there.\" The vixen said as she turned to face the tired fox. He didn't fell like talking, yet he knew her words were sincere. The look on her face showed gratitude he had expected to see from a certain hound, but instead found it lighting up the face of the one Chief tried to catch. His mouth opened as if to say something, but a yawn escaped his tired muzzle. \"Don't mention it,\" he replied. \"If I may ask, what happened to you?\" Tod raised his head up and looked into the dark eyes of the vixen a short distance away. \"What's your name?\" he asked quickly, as if trying to find a way of making the answer seem direct. \"Rose.\" \"Well, Rose, if you ever find yourself in a position to save the thing hating you, don't do it. I saved that mutt outside from a train. I am... was friends with his adopted son, but not anymore. He's a trained huntin' dog, a real killer. I didn't want to believe those wise words, but Big Mama was right.\" \"Time has a way of changing things?\" \"Yea, how did you know?\" \"She told me the same thing.\" (Author's note: So, what do you thing? I thought a slight change would do some good. Let me know what you think. Rose belongs to me, the rest belong to Disney. See you guys soon.)[Chapter 9] (Authors note: Hi all, I'm back again with another chapter. Like I said before, this was the restart of my writing. The updates will not always be this soon after each other, but I'll try. I'm glad to see the response to my last chapter, and I would like to thank everyone for reading and continuously supporting me. A thanks to 'Faith' for the review and favourite, as well as the others who have been here throughout the story. We pick this up at the Slade farm. Fixed spelling issues in this and previous chapter.) \"The time that takes can also give. Life can be taken, but not given. It can only be revealed.\" Evil-Copper The Slade farm, a few hundred meters from the other, seemed to have used the time it was given. The once cold barrels filled with the bodies of old hounds had been removed, making space for two bigger ones. The fresh smell of varnish coated the air as Amos applied a generous layer to them. The cold morning seemed to have prevented Copper from coming outside, creating the opportune time for a heart to heart. But how was this talk going to work? The pair had only just adjusted to the unfortunate passing of a newly reborn animal, an animal who seemed to give love and hate simultaneously, a fox who had been delivered to purgatory's gate, only to be spat back out into this world of cruelty where an animal is seen not by his heart, but by his standing in life. Yet the understanding of this fox's impact in Copper's life, what other choice did Chief have? Copper lay in the lounge, his body resting atop a rag sprawled out for the two visitors using this space. The Bloodhound was quite content. His usually cold morning routine was replaced with one consisting of lazing around until the next meal arrived. The sound of footsteps stole the hounds attention, calling him to turn his head in anticipation of the next bowl of food, though he was soon after surprised to see his adopted father. \"Chief, why did yea do that?\" Copper asked as the Wolfhound walked up to him, his face was a mixture of confusion and anticipation. \"Why did I do what?\" \"Yea made me thing food was coming,\" \"If yea need food, why didn' yea help with a hunt?\" Chief began, contemplating how to approach the subject he wanted. \"Yea woulda' seen something interestin',\" \"You chasin' your long lost rival?\" \"Okay, make it two then,\" \"Chief, if yea trying to say somethin', yea best be doing it. I'm getting tired.\" Chief had to do this, it was not something that could be left unsaid. The truth had to come out sometime. His heart raced as he sat down, straightening his face to get the message across that this was to be a serious conversation. Knowing this, Copper reluctantly sat up. His smile slowly faded following a sigh from Chief. \"My boy, there ain't no other way to put this.\" \"I don't want to hear anything about Tod, leave him rest in peace,\" Copper said as he turned around to walk of, but was stopped by the words the old hound recited. \"How can he rest in peace while walking around? Tod is alive.\" What do you mean she told you the same thing?\" Tod asked curiously at his unexpected guest. A vixen his eyes had not discovered until a few moments ago, a vixen with tales of life which could give guidance to even the most experienced in survival, a elderly vixen named Rose. By no account did the name register in his mind, and her voice played no familiar strings in the younger foxes ears, and yet something was unusual. A familiarity he could not shake. \"Well, there was once a time when prey and predator left each other alone, where both sides of the fence stayed clear of one another. So I asked Big Mama, 'What caused the drift between the hunter and the hunted?' and her simple response was that time had a way of changing things.\" Rose said as she slowly moved closer to Tod as he shifted uncomfortably hearing the very words once recited to him being recited to this complete yet almost mistakenly familiar stranger. As the vixen sat down, she twisted herself as she heard barking in the background, showing her back to Tod momentarily, but long enough for the fox to note two small bald patches on her back. The sight of them was almost chilling, yet probed the young fox to ask a question he had no business knowing. \"Rose, may I ask what happened to your back?\" Rose quickly spun back around until her face was locked with Tod's. She would have preferred him not to ask about it, but then again, he did jus save her. He had asked for nothing in return, making the young fox appear genuinely curious, not with her body and ability to preform, but in a simple mark on her back, a mark which would forever remain in her heart and her soul. She lowered her head and tried to suppress long held tears before deciding to answer the question, \"It was a while back. I was living nearby, and I had a kit. my mate and I were sleeping when a hound woke us up. It was that mongrel outside you saved me from. My mate told me to run and take our little one. And then...\" her sentence was brought to a hold as the elderly vixen could no longer carry the built up dams in her eyes. Tod was tempted to say that she need not continue if she didn't want to, but before he could open his mouth, she slowly began to breath deeper and slow the sobs to a point where she was able to talk. \"Then there was a boom. A gunshot followed by a long howl. A howl of victory. And when I turned around, he was after me. I ran fast, just fast enough to lay my only child by a fence. Then I ran off, trying to distract the hound. And I was shot at. A few pellets skimmed my skin, but I got away. Now I'm back to try and find him.\" \"Well,\" Tod began as he realised what was familiar. The smell that hit his nose seemed to tell him more than anything else. This vixen smelled significant, dominant but most importantly, as if he had acquired her aroma before. She had o be the one. The timeline matched up, and so, he smiled. \"You don't need to go looking anymore. Ma, It's me.\" \"It can't be... How?\" \"I was found by the fence at about the same time. Big Mama seemed to nurture me more than anyone else. She told me I was special. That my mother was out there somewhere. And she was right. I have found you, Mom.\" (Authors note: Well now, would you take a look at that. It seems Tod may recover after all, but not in the way you may think. For more information about Rose, please read \"The Past And The Present\" as that was where I got inspiration and ideas for this chapter. Rose is mine. The rest belong to Disney. I'll see y'all soon and thanks for reading.)[Chapter 10] (Authors note: Hi all. I'm back with yet another installment of this story. Now, the last chapter seemed to shoot a hole in my plan, so I had to adapt a little. I am also hoping to set a schedule to biweekly updating. I was not too sure on how this chapter would come out, but I decided to throw yet another spanner in the works. I hope you find it intriguing. Rose and Dr Mulligan belong to me. The rest are property of Disney. Thanks to 'Faith' for the continued support as well as my other fans.) \"Dwell not on wrong doing, but on what is to come.\" Evil-Copper \"Chief, yea need to let it go. He ain't comin' back!\" Copper responded to the inconceivable though the old Wolfhound seemed to have lodged in his mind. He was tired. A new grasp on his current situation had just been clasped, but the new information was threatening to unravel a side he had wished would remain sealed behind. For days after, more then that, maybe weeks later his pain remained present. Although in small quantity, he found the strength and determination to carry on, but now his mind was probing at him to find out more. \"I'm telling yea the truth. Why would I bring somethin' like this up if it ain't true?\" Chief asked. His unusually angry side pulled back the curtain to reveal a more sensitive one. He had only shown it once before, but ended up having it seep though for a second round. His words, like bells, rang in the younger Bloodhounds ears. 'Could he be tellin' the truth? Was he not mistaken? No, it can't be true? I saw what happened. I saw him fall. I saw him laying in the shallow pool surrounded by rocks, but I didn't see after that. He couldn't just up and off, he was injured bad. I can't even describe the sight I saw.' \"Sonny, say somethin' to me,\" \"Chief, I just can't believe what yea'r saying.\" The hound's slow and deep statement was justified. How could Tod still be alive? This seemed too much for the young hound to handle. He slowly stood up and was about to walk off when something caught his attention, something unique, something fresh, something like freshly baked biscuits. \"Chief, what's that smell?\" Knowing all too well that the hounds nose was a force to be reckoned with, his trademark in hunts that proceeded him. His absolute saviour. \"Why does it smell like baked food?\" \"I don't know? Maybe I picked it up at the Tweed farm.\" \"What made yea go there?\" \"My old rival. Yea guessed it earlier. I saw Tod there. If yea don't believe me, I'll show yea.\" \"Show me then.\" Copper walked in front of Chief, eager to see if what his adopted father was saying was true or not. His self control left that him behind as quickly as he left the building. With the speed of a hunting dog in his prime, the pair made hast to the other farm. The once well spoken air which filled the room in which Tod and Rose stood was now at a pike of defining quiet. The shortly lived banter between the long lost family had cessed. The pair were no longer looking at one another as if seeing friends, but that stare was replaced with one of familiarity, a weary glance of insurity in the words that rolled effortlessly of their tongues. The thought of seeing her son once again brought tears to Rose's eyes. Her mind was a mixture of questions. Was this truly her son? I wonder if he remembers me? How much does he know? But one rang out far more intensely than the rest floating around in her drowned head. Who saved him? The elderly vixen was but a few moments away from her question being asked when the sound of knocking on the door took the pair by surprise. Swinging their flexable necks, facing the duo's heads in the doors direction as Widow Tweed stood up and casually strolled over, not expecting anyone to be there. She flung the door open wide where a trio of fluttering birds awaited. Tod instantly recognised the smaller Finch and Woodpecker. Rose had no interest in the two on the side, but was more focused on the owl hovering in the center. The pair took this as a que to come outside and quietly slipped out while Widow chased of the feathery fliers. The birds then departed, having noticed that the animals they seek no longer stood inside but had retreated to the barn. Tod was the first on scene. His fur's glowing orange was now back, with exceptions in a few areas. His bushy tail now in it's former glory. His eyes were fresher than ever, instantly noticing Boomer, Dinky and Big Mama settling down in the far corner. He slowly padded over to them as they looked around for the vixen their eyes had caught earlier. \"Hello Big Mama, and fellers. What brings yea hear to my neck of the wood?\" Tod greeted, surprised to see them the first time since the morning after his injured body was found. \"Hello, Tod. We just came past to see how you were coping. A lot better by the looks of it.\" Big Mama says as she softly chuckles to herself. She realized her support may have been absent over the past few days, now causing her to try and find a way in which she could create opportunities for her visits. \"Oh yeah, we did, we did,\" Boomer's usual stuttering ever present as he tried to show his agreement with the statement. \"Hello, Big Mama,\" a soft greeted from a small distance away. The subtle old voice drifted through the air as it floated gently into the air in front of the mostly curious animals standing in a row. But it wasn't long before the old owl recognized the voice from her past, a past she had failed to inform Tod of, even after his numerous times begging and pleading to find out the truth. \"Well, I'll be damned. It's my old friend, Rose! Hehe, how yea been, Honey?\" Much to the elderly vixen's surprise, the friend she had once laid a large burden upon now greeted her with open wings. Her face could not contain the excitement in her soul, but before Rose could reply, barking in the distance turned all eyes to the opening across the barn. What was about to happen could never have been anticipated. (Authors note: Well, what did yeah think. I would really appreciate some feedback as to what you think will happen next. Also, I was thinking about adding quotes to each chapter, having them briefly describe what the chapter would contain. Please let me know and don't forget to fav/follow and review my stories.

I'm really sorry for the time I have spend not updating any of my stories, but I'm afraid I may have to take a long break. I am in my final year of school and have found less and less time for myself. I will try my upmost best to bring you guys more, but for now, my time has come to a hold. Please don't drop me off your list as I might be able to slip in a few short chapters here and there. Regards Evil-Copper[Chapter 12] (Author's note: Hi everyone, I'm back. I may not be back permanently, but this is still better than nothing. I am sincerely sorry about the wait, but I have been having a busy year. I hope you all enjoy the latest chapter.) You keep a lot to yourself because it is difficult to find others who understand Author unknown As the barking drew closer, the sound seemed to drown the sounds surrounding the young fox. The sheer memory seemed to slip though his injured body, hitting its target in his mind. Tod's head was bringing back the moment he wished he could forget, but he now knew who he was, what he was and who his true enemy should have always been. Mere moments before the howling of hunting hounds boomed throughout the bard, Big Mama shook Tod awake and ushered him and Rose out of sight before flying outside and landing on the roof, with Dinky and Boomer in toe. A few seconds past before a pair of dogs came into the large owls sight. She had a plan and was willing to execute it, even if it would cost Tod his one chance at making amends. \"Well, if it ain't the hunting howlers. What are you doing on the wrong farm?\" Big Mama's voice seemed to echo as the running pair came to an abrupt hold. Their eyes scanned around for any sign of the animal calling them, but without success until the sound of ruffling wings stole their attention, casting it toward the barns roof. Copper started, \"We mean no harm. We just...?\" \"You mean no harm!? How can you do any more than what you have already done?\" Big Mama replayed shortly, waiting impatiently for a reply. \"You not only hurt your best friend, you disregarded him.\" \"I never did that!\" Copper shouted out. Tears began welling up in his eyes, yet none trickled down the tan face once full of joy and excitement. \"Can yea prove that?\" Copper opened his mouth to try and bring something to his defence, but his voice seemed to disappear into thin air. His mouth no longer able to form the words he needed to say. His lungs emptied, yet nothing seemed to flow out. Tod and Rose could hear and see what was unfolding before them, but never thought they would ever witness what was happening. The idea of their worst enemy being able to show compaction for the animal they were trained to kill. Tod tried to step forward to talk to the pair of hounds, only to feel the scruff of his neck being pulled back by his mother. He had no other option but to oblige and sit down. \"Yea see, I know you don't feel sorry, you were just doing what...\" Big Mama continued before Copper intervened. \"I don't feel sorry!?\" The young Bloodhound shouted as his adopted father cautiously stepped back a few paces to a safe distance. He realized that Copper would have done anything to keep Tod safe, even if it meant having to disobey his master, or put himself in harm's way instead. \"I did everything I could! I wasn't the one who chased him. I'm not the one who forced him to save Chief. You still want to label me as the animal responsible?\" Copper finally stopped. It had taken its toll on not only him, but the one whom he needed to apologize to. Tod sat hidden away, his soul in shock of what his ears had just heard. \"I have tried so hard to make this work. Yea must have seen us when we were small. You think I would leave 'em to die there. I...\" His throat had dried, leaving him with nothing more than a pained voice to console the release of his long awaited feelings. \"I wish I could have taken his place,\" Copper said as his eyes could no longer hold back the tears he had been suppressing for far too long. His cheeks had turned into a valley, where between the mounds of fur, a small yet irreversible stream had descended. His face hung low, facing he opposite direction to hide his pain, although it was far too late. The trio of birds could see what had become of him. Their faces may have been out of sight to the hound, but surely enough he could feel the shock emanating from them. The atmosphere of the air had changed as even Chief could not bear to hide his disgust caused by nobody else but himself. Copper turned his front half to retreat back home, when an all too familiar voice mouthed words he would never forget. \"Do yea really mean that, Copper?\" The hound froze as he tried to comprehend what he had heard. It was not possible, an inconceivable thought of his imagination. However, when the words had been repeated, Copper felt a sharp pain full his body as he turned around to face the fox leaving his hiding space. His mouth gaped open as he examined the figure limping closer to him. How tragically awful he looked. His unsteady footing openly showing what had happened. His orange and white fur with a slight crimson tinge to it, a clear indication of the blood he had lost which was never truly cleared. It was as if he had seen a ghost. (Authors note: I was thinking about something like this for a while, but never had the time to do it. However, I'm extremely happy with the way it has turned out. A massive thanks to all my readers, faves and followers for the continued support, and to those whom take the time to write a review. Until I can do more, I hope you are all appeased.)[Chapter 13] (Authors note: Hi all. As we near the end of this story, I draw closer to finishing a piece of art. I may have been slow about it, but the best things take time to perfect. I hope you enjoy this chapter. Thanks to all my fav/follows and reviews on this story. PS: there may not be much happening in this chapter due to a bit of a writer's block, but this will all be sorted out in due time.) You have to get lost before you can be found. Jeff Rasley The blank expropriation on Copper's face was a true testament to the shock he had. His tear-filled eyes, never pausing, continued to flow down the young hounds cheeks as his eyes took in the sight of his presumably deceased friend. The once slick coat the fox he had come to know seemed in recovery of the last time he had seen the fox. Tod stood there, his legs paralyzed as his mind seemed to allow him to do less than nothing. His eyes fixed on the adult friend he had last trusted when he was only a kit. The feeling of uncertainty overtook the fox as the flood of memories seemed to flow back into his mind, seeking to comfort and confuse him. The truth behind Copper's motives was one he would only understand once his lips had formed the words needed to question the hound himself. Copper, however, had more than enough time to allow his curiosity to take over. How was it possible? His one true friend, whom he had seen drop from a bridge after being in contact with a train, now stood in front of him. \"T-Tod?\" Copper asked in disbelief. His mind still trying to process the event. \"It's me, Copper,\" Tod said softly as his legs became free from their frozen state as he began to walk towards his old best friend. As the young fox drew closer, his limp became more profound as the pain shot up with each step. His body evidently showed the ordeal he had gone through. Copper instantly noticed this and began running toward the fox, preventing him from having to walk more than he should. However, in his haste, he had not been as vigilant as he should have been. Just before he could step close enough to his friend to nuzzle him, his body was dealt a massive blow as his side was hit by a female fox. He may have been strong, but once Rose was able to pin him down, Copper was resigned to his fate. Chief, who was standing a few feet away, only realized what was happening after Copper was pinned. He turned to face the duo. He recognized the fox from earlier on and had unfinished business to attend to. Believing that Tod would be unable to do much, he raced toward Rose and knocked her off Copper, sending her crashing to the ground as he got on top of her for what would be the final time. This was it, the moment he had been waiting for. He would finally catch the one who got away from him. Before his head could lower and clamp down on his prey, his body was hit by another force. A force from someone he was not counting on. Once the Wolfhound found his feet, he looked at the source of his pain, only to realize that he was taken down by Tod. The young fox had fallen shortly after the impact and was struggling to get up. Chief walked forward to try to get back at Rose, only to be stopped by Copper, who made a barrier between him and his targets. Rose was the first to recover, her instincts telling her to look at Tod only to find him lying on the ground struggling to get his paws under him. She rushed to his aid and shifted her body under his, trying to lever him up. Once the young fox was on his feet, he instantly sat down as his injuries surged from his charge at Chief. The atmosphere was heavy with the feeling of tension and anticipation to find out who would make the first move. The group sat there, time slipped past as they all stared at each other with the intent of finding out what would happen next. However, as the time slipped away, it was clear that the energy died down enough for them to calm down. The two families sat facing each other, waiting for the other to make the first remark. Nevertheless, it would not happen like that. Big Mama had ushered off Dinky and Boomer to try to relieve the farm of potentially unwanted remarks. She, however, had not taken her eyes of the group. She waited on the roof, waiting for the moment to come. It would be there, but without wanting to disrupt the group, she reluctantly turned tail and flew off. (Authors note: So, as I have said earlier, this chapter is not much, but it is everything I could do for now. This is one of the final chapters. I am still deciding whether I should do one or two more, I will see next time. Please leave a review and fav/follow.) ","Summary":" (Authors note: Hi all, sorry for this, this... not really sure what to call it, but I was given thi"},{"Movie":"Reservoir Dogs","Title":"Silver Bullet","Author":"glitterXblood","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11749960","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N this is an adaptation of There's a Kid, that I had written several years ago during the cringe-worthy years of middle school. So if things look familiar, I'm not stealing, its me, still. Also disclaimer I only own what looks unfamiliar, everything else belongs to Tarantino. \"Whatchu lookin' for Av's?\" Eddie asks, not moving his legs from the table. \"My fucking math textbook,\" I repeat, shoving his feet off of the table. It wasn't there, but my science book was. \"You don't need math, just forget it,\" Eddie says. \"Maybe you didn't, but I do,\" I say, throwing my pencil at him. It hits him square in the forehead. \"Jesus, what you do that for?\" \"Just 'cause,\" I shrug, continuing to look for my book. \"Hey, you two, Joe wants to see you,\" Dov says, walking into the room. \"Shit, what did you do?\" I whisper, looking at Eddie while straightening my skirt. \"I didn't do anything. It was probably you,\" Eddie replies quietly. \"Me, what did I do?\" I ask. \"What didn't you do?\" Eddie counters. \"Okay, okay, but I haven't skipped that many days of school this semester,\" I say, mostly to myself. \"It's midterm and you've already missed 28-\" Eddie starts. \"Shut up!\" I exclaim as we reach the hallway outside of Joe's office. Eddie walks straight in, but I hang back slightly. \"Hey you,\" Mr. Purple says, walking out of Joe's office. \"Hey…\" \"You know that someone is going to catch on real quick that you aren't going to school right? Acting like you do homework and putting on your uniform isn't going to cut it anymore,\" Mr. Purple says in an almost whisper. \"I-\" \"No, Avery. Start going to school, I can work something with your principal so Joe doesn't find out. But you're cutting it close kid, less than two months and you graduate.\" \"I know, I know,\" I sigh. \"Do you? I don't think you do.\" \"I'll go tomorrow, promise,\" I say finally. \"Now go, I have a feeling you're going to like what's in there,\" Mr. Purple says, pushing me towards the office. I start walking slowly towards the office. If Mr. Purple knew, Joe knew. I look ahead, trying to gage how pissed Joe is, but my line of vision is blocked by someone I haven't seen in forever. \"Vic!\" I shout, running the last few steps and wrap my arms around him. \"When did you get out? I thought it was another six months.\" \"Few days ago,\" Vic says offhandedly. \"Have you been staying out of trouble?\" \"Yup,\" I say, and the same time Eddie says no. \"She skipped over 100 days so far this year,\" Eddie explains. \"How do you know that?\" I ask, turning on Eddie. \"Well someone has to read your report cards kid.\" Eddie shrugs. \"Nice D in math by the way. This is like your second time taking it, right?\" \"Damn,\" Vic says, \"What are you doing?\" \"I-uh, nothing,\" I stutter. \"Let me rephrase that,\" Vic says, \" Who are you doing?\" he asks with his signature smirk. \"I-uh-\" I stammer, feeling my face heat up. \"So there IS someone?\" Eddie asks, leaning back on Joe's desk. \"There's NO ONE!\" I say, completely honest, but they weren't buying it. \"Liar, so do we know this guy?\" Eddie asks. \"I'm not lying!\" \"Bullshit. So this guy, he treating you alright, or are we gonna have to kill him?\" Vic asks. \"You wouldn't!\" I say, but there's a small bit of me that knows that Vic might. \"So there is a guy!\" Eddie says, grinning like a cat that got the fucking cream. \"There isn't a guy!\" I protest. Eddie opens his mouth to say something but Joe cuts him off. \"Enough! We have business to discuss, but this doesn't mean I won't be talking to you later about this skipping school routine,\" Joe says. \"Shit,\" I mutter under my breath, sinking lower in the chair. Joe, Eddie, and Vic go on talking about getting Vic a job at the docks so he can start up working for us again. \"How do you feel about pulling a job with about five other guys?\" Joe asks Vic. I perk up at this. \"I'd feel great about it,\" Vic replies grinning. Finally. Finally a chance to do a job with Vic. I've been waiting for this for years. \"We'll call you later,\" Joe says as a way of dismissing him. Vic and Eddie leave the office and I start to follow. \"Avery,\" Joe says. \"Yes?\" I ask as sweetly as possible, turning around. \"Come here,\" he commands. I walk back into the office and stand in front of his desk. \"What was Eddie saying about you missing over 100 days of school?\" \"Oh that, pssh, you know Eddie. He exaggerates all the time, that's what he does, all right. He's exaggerating.\" \"Avery,\" Joe says, \"What do I always tell you?\" \"Don't talk about the family,\" I say. \"And?\" \"And don't spend so much money on books.\" \"And?\" \"And don't mouth off to any of your friends.\" \"How about go to fucking school?\" \"Right,\" I say, looking down at the desk. \"You're a smart kid, you could go far,\" Joe says. \"I know,\" I say quietly. \"Now go get ready. We're meeting some kid and Larry at Smokey Pete's,\" Joe says, dismissing me. Standing in the hallway are Eddie and Vic, looking like a couple of idiots trying to listen in. \"That's all?\" Eddie asks, looking upset I didn't get it worse. \"What can I say, Daddy won't do anything to his little princess,\" I mock, rolling my eyes. \"You're gonna get yourself kicked out of school,\" Vic says. \"Nu-uh, I'm passing all of my classes,\" I argue. \"They can kick you out for missing so many days of school, smartass,\" Eddie says. \"Wait, what?\" I ask, staring at both of them. \"Yeah, you can even get thrown in Juvie,\" Vic says. \"No you can't. Can you?\" \"Sure you can, it's like truancy or some shit like that,\" Eddie says. \"Wait, seriously?!\" I ask, worried. \"Yes,\" Vic says at the same time Eddie says \"No.\" \"Fuck you guys,\" I say, going into my room and slamming the door. After nearly ten minutes of searching I find my jacket under my bed. I grab my lipgloss, house keys and bottle of painkillers from my school bag and shove them in my jean pocket. I place my gun in one of my jacket pockets and my book in the other. \"Avery!\" Eddie yells from the front hall. \"I'm coming,\" I yell, leaving my room and shutting the door. I run down the stairs, skipping the last four and almost knocking into Eddie. \"Jesus christ kid,\" Eddie says, grabbing my shoulders to keep me from falling over. \"Where's Vic?\" I ask. \"Had to get back to the halfway house,\" Eddie explains, heading out of the house and to the car. \"So who's gonna be there?\" I ask from the backseat. Eddie was riding shotgun and Joe was driving. \"Larry-\" Eddie starts. \"Who's going by Mr. White,\" Joe interrupts. \"This new kid, Frankie, or Fredward, or something,\" Eddie continues. \"Who's going by Mr. Orange,\" Joe adds. \"Just them?\" I ask. \"Yeah, and you're not to say your name either,\" Joe says. \"There are some new guys on this job and they don't need to be knowing who you are. You will be going by Miss Silver.\" I sigh, staring out the window for the rest of the ride. \"You have your ID with you?\" Joe asks as we approach the bar door. \"Shit no, I left it in my car,\" I say after checking my pockets. \"Go wait by the back door,\" Eddie says, \"We'll be there in a few minutes.\" I sigh but make my way around the corner and into the alley behind the building. There's no one back there besides a guy with Laker's jersey and jean vest, leaning against the trashcans lighting up. \"Silvia?\" a waitress asks, opening the backdoor. I smile at her walking in and going to Joe's usual table. \"Whatchu get me?\" I ask Eddie, eyeing the drink that is placed in front of me. \"Try it,\" Eddie says. \"Not until you tell me what it is,\" I counter, throwing the straw wrapper at him. \"The same as always I see,\" Larry says, joining us at the table. \"Why would I change perfection?\" I ask, flipping my hair over my shoulder for added effect. \"You got a lot of changing to do then,\" Eddie smirks. \"Fuck off,\" I say, elbowing Eddie in the ribs. \"So are you gonna drink it or what?\" Eddie asks again. \"So are you gonna tell me what it is or what?\" I mimick. \"It's a fucking Jack and Coke, now stopping fighting, here comes our guy,\" Joe says, silencing us. I throw a piece of popcorn at Eddie in retaliation. \"Yeah, that's him,\" Eddie confirms. I look in the direction that they are staring in to see a familiar face staring back at me. Comic book guy. Shit, what's his name? He walks over our table. \"You alright? You look like you've seen a ghost,\" Larry says, putting a hand on my shoulder. \"I, uh,\" I say, breaking my gaze from comic book guy to look at him, \"I just feel a little lightheaded, I'll be right back.\" I get up from the table and head to the restroom. I lean against the wall trying to slow my breathing. I mean, this couldn't be that bad, I think. I review the things I know about comic book guy: he hung out around there in the fall, we only talked once around christmas, and then I stopped going because a job had us leave country for a month and a half. Fuck. What was his name? I need to get myself together. I glance at my watch, figuring I have only a minute or two before Joe sends someone looking for me. I look in the grimy mirror deciding what I could change to make me look not like the nerdy girl that hangs out at the comic book store. I take my hair out of its ponytail holder and tease it up a little with my fingers. I sigh, giving up pulling my hair back into a ponytail. Fuck it, I decide, walking back towards the bar room. Everyone seems to be laughing at something the guy, Mr. Orange said. I smile, sitting at the table between Eddie and Larry.[Chapter 2] A/N I own nothing, except for the stuff you don't recongnize I follow the cop down the hospital hallway, our footsteps echoing loudly. I think his name is Holdaway, but I'm not sure. He's the same cop that has been speaking to me on and off for the past three days. I twist my hands nervously, not knowing what to expect. We crisscross towards the back of the hospital, travelling downstairs and through hallways. Our footsteps echo down the hallway, and each one fuels my headache. Holdaway stops in the basement next to a doorway, turning to look at me. \"If you're not ready to do this, kid, you don't have to do it today. It can wait,\" Holdaway says, leaning against the door. \"No, it's fine,\" I say, taking a deep breath. \"It needs to be done.\" Holdaway opens the door and I follow him in. It's about 20 degree colder in the room and there are bright lights hanging above each table. On each of the six tables, there's a human shaped lump covered by a white sheet. I walk over to the table Holdaway is standing next to a he lifts the sheet. \"Can you tell me who this is?\" Holdaway asks. \"Mr. Bl-, Charles,\" I answer after taking a deep breath. I'm guessing that the cop wants any real names I know. I need to do this, I remind myself. He drops the sheet and walks over to the next table. I follow. He lifts the next sheet and I cringe slightly. There was a bullet hole point blank on his forehead. \"Mr. Brown,\" I say before Holdaway can ask. I wrap my arms around myself, fighting off the cold. Holdaway moves to the next table and lifts the sheet. I stare at the body on the table, not able to fully comprehend that he was dead. Completely 100% dead. \"Avery?\" Holdaway asks. I look up quickly. \"Joe,\" I say quietly. Holdaway nods and moves to the next table. I stand next to him waiting for him to remove the sheet. When he does I step back, knocking into a cart. He looks like he could be sleeping, but he always, no matter what, sleeps on his belly. He looks unnatural, like he's pretending or something. \"You alright kid? You going to throw up or something?\" Holdaway asks. \"I'm fine,\" I say brushing away tears. \"It's Eddie.\" Holdaway nods again, moving to the next table. Vic, it has to be. I prepare myself for the sight, his body riddled with holes, cold and pale. Holdaway lifts the sheet and I feel my stomach fall to my feet. I take a step forward before turning on my heels and running out of the morgue. I skid around a corner and collapse to the floor. It wasn't suppose to be him, anyone but him. With him gone, there's no one left. Everyone, everyone was in that room, except for me. This isn't how it suppose to end. Not like this. Not with everyone gone- \"Miss, miss, can you look at me, miss?\" a voice asks. I look up from my hands and find the source of the voice. It is a young nurse kneeling in front of me. \"I'm going to take you upstairs, do you think you can walk?\" I nod slowly. The nurse grabs my arm and pulls me up. Holdaway appears out of nowhere, wrapping his arm around my waist and guiding me down the hallway. We get to an empty room and the nurse helps me onto the bed. The nurse leaves and returns to the room a few times, before leaving the room with Holdaway. \"Well look at what the fucking cat dragged in,\" a new voice drawls from the doorway. I look up and see Pink being escorted by cops down the hall. \"Finally decided to join the fucking party, Miss Silver? Where've you been, huh? Fucking the other cops like you fucked Orange? Bet you knew who the rat was the whole time, didn't you? Wanted to get away from all this? Well, guess what princess, this is it! This is what you fucking get for ratting on your family. Yeah, remember your family? The ones who are now dead because of you!\" \"Move it, Donowitz,\" one of Pink's cops says, shoving him down the hall. I place my hands over my ears in a bad attempt to block out his shouting. \"Avery?\" Holdaway asks from the end of the bed. I remove my hands and stare at him. \"What just happened?\" \"Pink walked by, and I guess he saw me, and he started shouting, and…\" I finish with a shrug. \"And before that?\" Holdaway asks. \"I don't know what your talking about,\" I tell him. \"Avery, let's make a deal. If you stay honest with me, I will let you be involved with this case,\" Holdaway offers. I size up Holdaway: so far he has been the only cop to constantly talk to me. But I can tell he doesn't trust me, and to be honest I don't trust him either. He hasn't answered any of my questions about anyone. But there is a chance that if I talk, he will tell me something, anything, about the rest of the group. \"I didn't know that it would be him. He was alive when I came out.\" \"Who?\" Holdaway presses. \"Larry.\" \"So you knew the others would be dead?\" Holdaway asks. I nod. \"Mr. Blue and Mr. Brown never came back to the warehouse. If they were alive they would have come back.\" \"I see. So then I am sure you know which of you are still alive?\" \"Me, Mr. Pink and Freddy.\" \"And Vega,\" Holdaway adds. If time could both stand still and go at super speeds, that was what was happening to me. My mind was completely blank of everything except for one thought: I wasn't alone. \"What?! Where is he?\" I ask, moving off of the bed and towards the door. I screwed up. Oh god, I screwed up. I left him, I said he was dead. I left him for dead. \"Avery, stop,\" Holdaway says, moving in front of the door. \"I have to see him. I have to see him!\" I repeat, again and again, trying to get past him. I can't tell if I want hit Vic or hug him for still being alive. \"Avery, you need to calm down, right now.\" \"I need to see him!\" I cry, struggling against Holdaway. \"You can't-\" \"I need to know that he's alive. I need to!\" I shout, clawing against Holdaway. There's a pick in my arm and everything goes fuzzy before going black. A/N reviews would be wonderful :D[Chapter 3] A/N as usual I own the things that look unfamilar I flick through the book in my hand, not reading but feeling the pages pass over my fingertips. Eddie was late, again. The school ground was nearly empty, save a few stoners lingering by the staircase. I lean against the fence, flicking through the book again. The screeching of brakes draws my attention. \"Get in loser!\" Eddie shouts through the window. I glare at him and get into the car. \"Jesus, Eddie, why are you playing such godawful music?\" I complain from my spot between Orange and one of Eddie's friends. I've seen him enough times to know that he can get pretty jumpy. I think he was going by Pink this time around. \"First of all, this music is legendary. Second of all, all us guys grew up on this shit so we love it. And third of all, probably most important, Mr. Blonde would fuck you up if he heard you say that,\" Eddie concludes, smirking. \"Well Mr. Blonde's not here, so I don't have to worry about that, unless anyone else feels the needs to 'fuck me up' for what I said,\" I counter, rolling my eyes at Eddie's threat. It's the same threat Joe, Eddie, and anyone who was around used on me as a child. It lost its power when I was thirteen. \"Well I feel the need to do something else to you,\" Pink smirks, raising an eyebrow. \"Hey, that's my sister you're talking to, you piece of shit,\" Eddie says, glancing in the rearview mirror and grinning. \"Aw, lay off Eddie, it didn't mean anything,\" I say, winking at Pink. \"Yeah Eddie, it didn't mean anything,\" Pink says, grinning. \"Like hell it didn't,\" Eddie jests, pulling into a parking lot. \"This the place?\" White asks from the front seat. \"This is it,\" Eddie agrees, getting out of the car. We all follow suit. I follow Orange into the warehouse. \"Watch where you're going,\" Vic says, yanking on my ponytail. \"What was that for?\" I ask, hitting him with the back of my hand. \"Eddie told me that you were flirting the other night, and now I catch you staring… I thought I had taught you to have better taste.\" \"That's a lie, and you know it,\" I say. \"And for your information, I have great taste. Even I wouldn't stoop that low,\" I add, looking at Orange and then back at Vic. \"Ever.\" \"Cut the bullshit kid,\" Vic smirks. \"You're impossible,\" I sigh, walking away from him and towards the chalkboard at the far end of the warehouse. I sit in one of the chairs that is set up, opening up the book that's still in my hands. \"What do you have there?\" Orange asks, sitting down and gesturing to the book. \" Pet Sematary ,\" I say, showing him the cover. \"Doesn't seem like your usual type.\" \"And what would you call my usual type?\" I ask, looking around at the group of men surrounding us. Most of them were talking in groups, mainly because most of us knew each other. Charles, who was going by Mr. Blue, was discussing something with Joe and Larry. Vic and Eddie were also talking together. Mr. Pink was leaning against one of the walls, and the last guy was looking uncomfortable, standing next to the door. I can only count three people that aren't in Joe's inner circle, and two that have never worked with us at all. \"All right gentlemen,\" Joe bellows. I cough. \"And ladies, let's get started.\" I watch as everyone files into the seats. Pink sits at my other side and Vic sits in front of me. Joe begins rambling about not being caught and Hawaii. He tells everyone their code name, and Vic cringes slightly when he hears his. Blonde. He hates it. I grin, thinking about how he got the name. I was young, maybe seven when I realized that something weird went on in the house. Joe sat me down and explained it all and for some insane reason I wanted in. Being seven there was much I could do, but he did let me assign everyone code names for jobs. Some of them stuck longer than others. \"Now, I made reservations at Benvolio's for all of us tonight. Seven o'clock sharp. I told management to put the bill under my name but I don't need you wasting it all on booze,\" Joe says in a way of dismissal. Everyone starts heading towards the door and I follow. \"Hey, Miss Silver, come here,\" Joe growls. I turn on my heel and walk over to him. \"Yeah?\" I ask. Joe waits until everyone is out of the warehouse before speaking. \"I don't want you going to Benvolio's tonight. You've got school tomorrow.\" \"What the hell? You just told everyone to spend tomorrow going over the plan!\" I shout. \"Yeah, but I need you to stop missing school.\" \"I went today, that should be good enough. Oh and by the way, I saw Mr. Purple tailing me all day.\" \"I shouldn't have to put a tail on you, for Christ's sake, but I do.\" \"Come on Joe. I'm part of this team as much as any of them. Hell, I need to know them better than they need to know each other. Because if something goes wrong, which it probably will, I need to know how to calm them the fuck down.\" \"You're right. I'm just looking out for you. Your father didn't want this life for you, and I don't want it being messed up before you're free in a few months.\" \"I know Joe, and thanks, really, for everything,\" \"You're alright kid,\" Joe declares. I follow him out to his car where Vic and Eddie are waiting. The drive back to the house is quiet. I go up to my room and unlock the door. I throw my book onto the bed and unload my gun, placing it on my desk. I turn around and Eddie is laying on my bed and Vic is sitting on the small couch I have. \"Jesus Christ, give me a heart attack why don't you,\" I complain, glaring at both of them. \"We're just going to get straight to business,\" Vic says. \"Close the door.\" I close the door. \"We know you like Orange,\" Vic says bluntly. \"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" I say, walking over to the closet. I knew what they were playing at, and I wasn't going to give in this time. Eddie liked to see how well he could get in my head before a job. I have no idea why, or when, Eddie thought it would be a good idea to try to mess with me before a job, but he did. And somehow, Vic was now in on it. \"I don't blame you, he looks like he would be an easy fuck,\" Vic ponders. \"Gross,\" I comment pretending to vomit. I flick through the closet, going between wearing jeans or a skirt. Jeans, has to be jeans. This group of guys had one too many sleezes. \"You know Eddie, I think your sister needs to get laid,\" Vic says offhandedly. \"I do not!\" I shriek, turning around. I can feel the blood rushing to my cheeks. \"I'm going to have to agree with you on this,\" Eddie agrees. \"You've been very tense lately,\" he says matter of factly. \"I have not been tense ,\" I hiss. \"Well even if you were trying to get laid, it wouldn't ever happen in that,\" Blonde says, gesturing to the clothes in my hand. \"Well if you're so wise, why don't you pick something out?\" I ask, throwing my clothes at him and sitting down in the desk chair. Vic swaggers over to my closet, lighting up a cigarette as he goes. \"Why Orange?\" Eddie asks. \"For fucksake, I do not like Orange.\" \"You sure? Because you too were getting pretty friendly in the car, and then again in the warehouse.\" \"Oh my god. You act like you've never seen two people be friends. Oh thats right, you both fuck anything that will look at you, without even checking to see if it's alive or not.\" \"Those are fightin' words, you sure you don't want to take them back?\" Eddie asks. \"Oh, I'm positive.\" I smirk. \"And you know why?\" \"Why?\" Eddie asks. \"You would never actually fight me. You know I would win,\" I grin. \"Found something, if you're done acting like a child,\" Vic states, stepping away from the closet. \"What did you find?\" I asks, sitting up. Vic doesn't reply, but insteads holds up a dark blue dress: tight at the top and flare below the waist, ending just above my knees. \"No way in hell,\" I say, crossing my arms. \"And why the fuck not?\" Eddie asks. \"There's no way I could be protected in that. There's absolutely no place for me to have any weapons on me. Not even a knife. No way.\" \"We would protect you,\" Eddie offers. I scoff at this. \"Eddie, you can't shoot for shit.\" \"Come on Avery, it's not like you'll need any weapons, it's a dinner,\" Vic says. \"And plus, it would look great on you.\" \"Hypocrite. We all know you're gonna walk in there with three different kinds of weapons.\" \"It would make Orange want to fuck you,\" Vic says. I groan. \"Just get out of my room. I need to shower,\" I say, pointing at the door. Neither of them move. \"Get out, goddammit!\" \"Jesus, we're going,\" Eddie says, leaving the room. Vic gives me a look before following Eddie. What the look meant, I have no idea. I put on a Red Hot Chilli Peppers CD and get in the shower. I wrap my hair in a towel and look at the dress Vic had picked. He was right, it would look great. Too bad he will never have the satisfaction of knowing that. I smirk, pulling on the clothes I had originally thrown at him. I add some light make up and straighten my hair. I grab my knife and slip it into my pocket as well as a pair of heels which I carry downstairs with me. \"Where is everyone?\" I ask Joe. \"They left,\" he grunts not looking up. \"What about Mr. Purple?\" I ask. Mr. Purple normally drives me places so I don't have to drive. It's not that I'm a bad driver, I just don't like it. \"Out on business.\" \"Oh,\" I say, \"Well, can I have the car keys?\" Without looking up, Joe tosses a set of keys at me. I pocket them and set about getting my shoes on. \"Bye Joe,\" I call over my shoulder. \"Be careful,\" Joe adds just as the door closes behind me. I make my way over to the garage, wondering exactly where the car I have the keys to is. I finally find it after walking past the four other cars in the garage. I drive down the driveway, flipping through radio channels, looking for music that doesn't suck. The drive to Benvolio's takes nearly twenty minutes in the Los Angeles traffic. I park nearly two blocks away from the restaurant, just in case. I walk in, past the hostess, and go straight into the back room. Charles, Larry, Mr. Brown and Mr. Pink are already there. I sit down to the right of Larry. \"You okay kid? You look pissed,\" Larry says. \"I had to drive here,\" I huff. \"That's tough luck. I thought Eddie or Mr. Blonde were going to drive you.\" \"Yeah, I thought so to, but when I got downstairs, it was a ghost town. No one but Joe,\" I say. Mr. Brown gives us a weird look, but I shrug it off. Most of the new guys don't get the relationship that there is between most of us. \"You still having problem driving, hun?\" Charles asks from the other side of Larry. \"I don't have problems driving, I just don't like driving,\" I explain. \"It's always the same with chicks, shouldn't be allowed on the road,\" Mr. Pink says to Mr. Brown. \"Is that so?\" I ask, leaning back in the chair, sending a cold glare at Pink. \"Oh, looks we have ourselves a feminist,\" Pink jeers. \"Oh, look, we have ourselves an asshole,\" I shoot back, acting surprised. \"Now, come on kids, let's stop bickering,\" Vic says, approaching the table. I sigh, rolling my eyes. Let the night begin. A/N reviews would be nice, say what you love, you hate, anything your feeling[Chapter 4] A/N this one is short and sweet, but we are getting closer to the fun stuff . As per usual, I don't one anything Tick. Tick. Tick. Jesus, why do I have such an annoying clock? I sit up and notice two things: one, I'm not in my room; and two, it's not my clock. There's no guard in the room, so I slip out of the bed and head towards the doorway. The hallway is also empty. I pad down the hallway, the soles of my feet making a quiet slapping sound. I'm going to need to find out what happened to my shoes. I peek into every room, looking for Vic. After what feels like hundreds of room, I find him, sitting in a bed, staring at the door. \"You're alive,\" I breathe, moving closer to him. \"Am I? Can you be sure of that?\" Vic deadpans, and then winces. \"Are you okay?\" I ask, moving even closer. Just by looking at him I can tell that he's not. I can tell by the way he's sitting that his chest has been heavily bandaged, and most likely it hurts to breathe. \"I'm just peachy. Got seven fucking holes in my chest, but I'm just peachy,\" Vic growls. I take a step back, unsure of what he's going to do. \"Fuck. Avery - the past few days have been hell, I'm sure you've been through hell, come here,\" Vic says in apology. I go over to him and he wraps his arms around me in a hug. I move so that I am sitting on the end of his bed, with my arms wrapped around my knees. \"Well, it hasn't been easy,\" I agree. \"So where's Eddie and Joe? It's not like them to hold out on me like this,\" Vic jokes. \"They're busy,\" I lie, looking down. \"Busy? Busy doing what?\" \"Working with Mr. Purple to get us out of this hospital and down to Hawaii,\" I tell him, turning the hospital bracelet on my wrist over and over again. It would be true, if they were alive. \"So why are you here?\" Vic asks. \"Well, I was hit in the head by a freakin' gas can,\" I snap, glaring at him. Truth be told, I probably should have been in the hospital, at least for concussion checks, but the police seemed to forget that. \"So what happened? How did we all end up arrested?\" Vic asks. \"I don't think we should be talking about that here,\" I say, glancing back at the door. \"And why the fuck not?\" \"I-I can't,\" I whisper. \"You can't or you won't, Avery? I know you're hiding something from me.\" I shake my head, tears falling onto the hospital blanket. \"Avery, I saw Orange coming out of your room that night. Did he do something to you? Did he hurt you in any way? Because I swear to god, I will murder him if he did-\" \"Vic!\" I gasp. \"He didn't do anything like that, that's not what happened-\" \"Then. What. Happened,\" Vic growls. \"We did nothing, alright? Where the hell is this even coming from?! You have no idea what happened. And the truth of what did happen is going to stay between me and Freddy.\" \"Avery, if he hurt you…\" \"Freddy wouldn't hurt me,\" I say confidently. \"Are you sure? Because from what I've seen he has no problem hurting people; he shot me seven fucking times.\" \"You knocked me out with a fucking gas can,\" I argue. \"That was different, I didn't kill you.\" \"You could have. And from what Larry said, it sounded like you went insane in the store.\" \" We have a Code Amber in the Kennedy High Security Ward. I repeat Code Amber in the Kennedy High Security Ward ,\" a voice rings throughout the room and the hallway. I stare at Vic, debating my options: if I leave, Vic won't get in trouble; if I stay, I can know what will happen, to both of us. \"I should go,\" I say at the same time Vic says \"Stay.\" \"Vic, I can't.\" \"Avery, please.\" \"If they find me here, it won't be good, for either of us...\" I trail off, looking at the door behind me. \"The hell with that, we're already in custody, what more can they do?\" Vic shouts. I shake my head, getting off of the bed and walking towards the door. \"I'm sorry, I can't,\" I say, walking out the door. I look behind me, and Vic is sitting their looking at me with a look that can only be described as a kid learning that his family wasn't going to come back. I walk down the hall, turning in the opposite direction of my room. I find a chair and sit down to wait for someone to find me. A/N and there we go, leave your thoughts down below :)[Chapter 5] A/N as usual I don't own anything you recognize \"You sure you don't want any?\" Vic asks, waving a bag of greasy fast food in front of my face. \"Vic, don't, I might be sick,\" I groan, leaning away from him. Eddie snickers from the driver's seat, pulling out the parking lot. \"Are you sure?\" Vic pesters again, this time nearly shoving a hamburger in my face. \"You're a dick,\" I say, glaring at him from behind my sunglasses. \"I think what you need is some music,\" Eddie grins, turning on the radio and cranking up the volume. The throbbing in my head intensifies immediately, changing from the dull thud it had settled into all morning into a faster, sharper pain hitting every time I blinked. I close my eyes to the pain, focusing on not being sick. \"You don't look so good Av's,\" Eddie comments. \"No shit, Sherlock,\" I mutter. \"You realize this is your fault though,\" Vic adds. \"And what the fuck is that suppose to mean?\" I snap glaring at both of them. I notice we are parked on a street across from a row of businesses. \"How many drinks did you even have last night?\" Vic asks. \"I don't know. Mr. White got me what he always does, and than I think Mr. Pink got me another drink and it was like ten times stronger, and…\" I trail, off trying to remember the rest of the night. I manage to piece together that Mr. Pink was trying to get me alone and that Mr. Orange and I left the restaurant together and that's where everything goes fuzzy. Fuck. What happened? \"Av, first, you need to stop accepting random drinks from people; and second, you seriously need to stop being a fucking lightweight,\" Eddie grins. \"Oh shut up.\" \"He's, right you know. If you weren't such a lightweight you would be fine right now, nearly everyone there drank twice as much as you did and everyone is fine.\" \"For christ's sake, just layoff. It was a bad move, a mistake. Things happen.\" I was not in the mood for a lecture today, but obviously the two dimwits in front of me didn't understand that. \"Do you not understand how important this job is? Obviously not if you think that things just happen. Things don't just happen. We don't know all the guys on this job, we don't know if one of them is going to snap and shoot up the store or go crazy while at the warehouse. You can't assume everything is going to be alright. Dammit, Avery.\" \"I can't help it if someone goes crazy in the store. We both know that. But I've dealt with most of these guys before, I know how to handle them. I don't know why everyone is so jumpy about this.\" \"Just try not to do anything stupid. I need you two,\" Eddie says, gesturing to me and Vic, \"To keep your heads up and make sure nothing gets seriously fucked up.\" \"I know,\" I sigh. It was always about making sure no one fucked up, but no one ever gives a decent definition of what that means. I guess it depends on what your job is, if you fucked up or not. If the people of the store played hero and fought against Vic, I guess he fucked up. But that being said, nearly every job that has happened has been fucked someway or another. The worst thing that could happen would be if someone was a cop, but then again, Joe would shoot the guy straight in the face if there was a rat. Mr. Brown might be a rat; I know he's new this job, just a get away man. I'll have to ask Eddie, or maybe Larry about him later. \"Which hotel are we going to tonight?\" Vic's question brings me out of my own head. \"We haven't done that in forever,\" I say at the same time Eddie names one of Joe's favorite hotels. \"Daddy wants to get an early start tomorrow.\" Eddie shrugs and then adds, \"And don't try to fight this Av's, I know you don't like it, but it's what Daddy wants.\" I sigh, biting my tongue. I wasn't planning on fighting this, and Eddie knew that. \"What time are we meeting?\" I asks. \"Why, you got somewhere to be?\" Vic asks. \"I..\" I pause. Normally I would go to the comic book store to see comic book store guy, but now that guy is Mr. Orange. Total plan killer. \"No, just wondering,\" I finish dejectedly. \"Then stop asking questions already,\" Vic says, flicking his cigarette butt out the window. A/N Hey guys. So this is now chapter five, and I hate to do this, but reviews maybe? Please. It's hard to upload chapter after chapter not knowing if anyone is actually reading and liking, or hating. It will take less than a minute to leave just one small review. And I honestly hate begging like this, but I can't see myself uploading anymore without some type of response. -L[Chapter 6] A/N I have to start by saying I really like the beginning of this chapter. This is also where the story picks up. As per usual I don't own anything you recognize. Bang. Freddy falls back against the ramp. Bang. Joe falls backwards onto the concrete. Bang. Larry stumbles, falling to his knees. Bang. Eddie flies backwards into the concrete. I stand up walking over to Freddy. As I past Eddie, a hand grabs my leg. His hand grabs my leg. He looks up at me, eyes a dull milky white, crimson staining his windbreaker, his lips a cold blue. \"This is your fault,\" he whispers, his voice hoarse and strained. I try to move away, but his grip is like cold steel, keeping me still. Another hand grips my other leg. I look to see Mr. Blue gripping my leg. His hair is matted with blood; the bullet hole is nowhere to be seen from the front. \"I'm dead because of you,\" he says, his nails digging into my leg. Another hand, this time wrapping around my wrist. I try to shake it, looking to see who had me. Joe's hand is wrapped around my wrist in the same manner as when I was little and he was keeping me from running into traffic. His expression mirrors Eddies, with milky eyes and blue lips. \"I told you, and you messed it up,\" he says pulling on me. Another hand wraps around my arm. I know the hand without even looking. I couldn't look. A sharp tug bring my eyes to meet his. Larry doesn't say anything, telling me everything I did wrong with his eyes. Another hand. This one pulling at the material of my t-shirt, threatening to bring me down. Mr. Brown continues pulling and pulling, his face covered in blood, unreadable. \"You caused this, all of this,\" he chokes, spitting blood out of his mouth and spraying me with every word. A pair of hands grip my shoulder, pushing me down into the group of hands surrounding me. I fall into the group, each of them pulling and scratching. \"You deserve this,\" Vic says, standing above me as they continued pulling and crushing. He joins the group with his razor in hand. I'm drowning. I shut my eyes knowing this is the end. \"Look at me. Look at me Avery. Look at what you did!\" Freddy shouts. \"Avery!\" A voice shouts. Hands grip my shoulders, shaking them. \"Avery!\" I open my eyes to see Vic standing over me, gripping my shoulders. I kick out, freeing myself from him and run into the bathroom, locking the door. I look around for anything to protect myself with from the zombified Vic in my room. I curse, watching the door handle jingle, and then the door pops open. \"What the fuck Avery?\" Vic asks. \"Don't come any closer,\" I warn, tightening my grip on the hair straighter in my hand. \"'m not going to hurt you,\" He says stepping forward. \"Prove it,\" I say. He raises his hands slowly, palms facing me. \"Avery, what happened?\" \"Nothing, I'm fine,\" I counter quickly. \"Avery, you can't lie.\" Vic says, taking another step closer. \"You're shaking.\" \"I'm…\" I start, and then stop. I was far from okay. I slump against the countertop, letting the straightener fall to the ground. \"You're right. I can't lie. I should have told you, I'm sorry.\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. This is all my fault,\" I cry, wiping away tears with the back of my hand. \"Just calm down and explain,\" Vic says, leaning against the wall across from me. \"I'm sorry, please don't hate me,\" I start, speaking barely above a whisper. \"It went bad, very bad. Mr. Blue and Mr. Brown were dead before you got to the warehouse.\" \"Sometimes a few guys got to die, you know this,\" he shrugs. \"Then at the warehouse, there was a standoff, and..\" I trail off, avoiding Vics gaze. \"And-? What happened? Did your fucktoy get shot in the face? If so I would like to congratulate whoever did it.\" \"Well that's not going to happen, because that person is dead!\" I snap. \"Who?\" Vic asks calmly. Anyone off the street would think he was asking something as simple as who was on the phone, but if you looked closer you could see something building up behind his eyes. I shake my head no, I couldn't do that to him. If he knew it would destroy him. \"Tell me who, Avery!\" \"Larry, and Joe, and Eddie. All of them. They're all dead,\" I whisper. Vic slams his fist into the wall next to him, leaving a hole. He stalks out of the bathroom, leaving a muttered string of expletives behind him. I follow his trail of shouts and bangs through my room, downstairs and into Joe's office where I find him tearing through desk drawers and filing cabinets. \"What are you doing?\" I ask, watching him flick through papers. \"We need to get out of here. We have maybe an hour before the cops are checking here for me. You need to come with me,\" Vic says, abandoning the papers and walking over to my side of the desk. \"Vic, I can't,\" I whisper, refusing to look at him. \"And why not?\" he asks. I bite my tongue, still looking away from him. \"Avery, what do you know? Is anyone else still alive? Answer me.\" I sigh, resolving to give limited answers. \"Yes, people are still alive.\" \"There was a rat, wasn't there? Who was it?\" I shrug. \"Couldn't have been Pink, he was to jumpy. Both of us are here right now. Orange isn't. Everyone else is dead. Was it Orange?\" \"No-\" \"Goddamit. I will kill that low life lying rat. I will kill him.\" Vic whispers, his face darkening into something I have never seen before. \"Don't. Vic you can't.\" He takes a step closer to me, now towering over me. \"I mean- it wouldn't be smart- you know- you need need to lay low- and uh-\" I stammer. \"And how exactly do you know all of this? Because it seems to me, you know a lot of things you're not telling me. So tell me, how do you know who's dead and who's alive? Because I remember Joe and telling you, that if anything happens, you're suppose to get out of the country and into Canada as fast as possible. And if I recall, everyone dying counts as something happening.\" \"I tried. I went outside, and the cops were already there. They were already had me in cuffs before I was even two feet away from the door. I was down in an interrogation room for nearly two days. And then I when I got out, I couldn't just leave, I didn't know where anyone was. And then at a diner, I saw the paper, saying that Joe- Joe was dead. I panicked. And some people brought me to the hospital. You know this,\" I say, hoping that Vic would accept this half-truth. He couldn't know about Freddy and the other cops. \"Stop lying to me!\" Vic shouts. He grabs my forearms, easily wrapping his entire hand around my arm, and pulls me closer to him. \"How do you know all of this?\" \"You- you don't want to know.\" His grip tightens to being almost unbearable. I let out a gasp of pain, struggling to free myself. This wasn't right. This was far from right. Vic didn't act like this. Vic was chill, and collected, and distant. This wasn't the Vic I knew, this was the Mr. Blonde Larry and Mr. Pink were shouting about. This was the Mr. Blonde that shot up the store, and tortured the cop. \"I'm feeling nice today, so I will give you one more chance to tell me what really happened, or I might end up doing something we both will regret.\" \"It was the cops!\" I shout in his face, \"They told me everything! They took me to the fucking morgue and made me identify everyone! And you know what? I answered every single one of their fucking questions too! I told everything I knew to Freddy and Holdaway and McCluskey and every other fucking cop that talked to me!\" Vic takes a step back, and then another, backing into the desk. I break away from his grip, turning and running down the hallway. I hear him coming after me as I struggle with the locks on the front door, tears blurring my vision. I burst onto the front lawn, running across it onto the street. I keep running, ignoring the sharp pricks of the pavement against the soles of my feet as I run. I'm listening for anything that tells me that he's behind me. I turn and see headlights behind me, moving at a speed that's anything but legal. I duck into the shadows, waiting for the car to pass. It screeches past, and I allow myself to exhale. And then the headlights are back, zooming down the street towards me. I curse, dashing down a small side street. I reach the middle of the street, which is cut off with a chain link fence. I look back and see a figure standing at the end of the alley. I start climbing without thinking. When I get over the top, the edge of my shorts get caught, trapping me there. I curse again, pulling at the fence. It releases me, leaving long angry scratches down my leg and letting me fall the eight feet onto the rough pavement below. Pop . White hot pain tears through my left arm, starting in my shoulder, racing down to my fingertips and back up. I muffle my cries by biting down on the palm of my hand. I know it's dislocated. I know I probably shouldn't try to pop it back in now. I need to wait out the initial pan. I wait, black spots dancing across my vision, growing bigger and faster as the seconds progress. I focus on breathing and willing myself to pass out, but luck is not on my side. A/N Thank you ToothpickVicChic for your lovely review. Comments, questions, and criticism are always appreciated.[Chapter 7] A/N a couple of disclaimers this chapter. Disclaimer #1: I recently lost my beta, so don't hate if the spelling and grammar falls apart. My beta had read through and beta'd this entire story once (and yes that means the whole thing is written, and the more you review the sooner the chapters go up), however I may change small things, and therefore there could be a few slip ups. Don't hate me. Disclaimer #2: I only own the things, concepts, people you don't recognize. Disclaimer #3: This is a realllllly fluffy chapter. Knock Knock \"Come in,\" I say, not looking up from the math problem I'm working on. \"Hi, um, hey,\" Mr. Orange says, leaning against the doorframe. \"Hi-um-hey yourself,\" I say, smiling at him. \"Whats up?\" \"You didn't come down to the poker game, and, I was wondering what was up?\" he says awkwardly. I grin. \"Well to be completely honest, I suck at poker, and I didn't really want to get drunk the night before. Plus, there's the joys of transformations of functions,\" I add, motioning to the papers in front of me. \"Can I?\" he asks, picking up the packet I am working on. He sits down next to me looking over the packet. \"What is this, like, Calculus?\" \"Pre-calc,\" I say, blushing. \"I had to retake algebra two last year.\" \"So that makes you a… ?\" he asks, leaving the end of the question open. \"Senior,\" I finish, watching his face cloud in confusion. He shakes his head, turning back to the packet. \"You see here,\" he says, pointing at the problem, \"When you have multiplication to the x, you actually multiply all of the x values by the reciprocal. So where it is 2x you would actually multiple the x values by ½.\" \"Oh, right,\" I say, looking at the paper. \"You're still lost?\" \"Yeah, I just don't get any of this. Like why does it matter if some stupid lines are moving one way or another?\" \"Well,\" he starts, leaning back against the headboard. \"It really doesn't. Like it does, short term, but honestly, it doesn't. Does that make sense?\" \"Yeah, doesn't make it suck any less.\" \"You couldn't be more right about that,\" he laughs. \"So why aren't you at the poker game?\" \"I'm out already. Your brother plays a mean game.\" \"Eddie? Eddie can't play for shit.\" \"I thought you and Mr. Blonde were siblings?\" \"Me and Vic- fuck. You didn't hear that,\" I say, giving him a glare. He quirks an eyebrow, amusement spreading across his face. \"Me and Mr. Blonde are not siblings. Don't get me wrong, I consider him my brother and everything.\" \"So then it's one big happy family? You, Eddie, and Joe?\" \"Sunday night dinners, family game nights, the whole nine yards.\" I smirk. \"Really?\" he probes. \"Honestly? It sucks.\" \"I can imagine,\" he says, pulling out a pack of cigarettes. \"You want one?\" \"Oh, no, I don't smoke.\" \"Yet another another surprise,\" he says, lighting the cigarette and bringing it to his lips. \"What do you mean by that?\" I ask. \"Oh, nothing you need to worry about,\" he chuckles. \"Jerk,\" I mutter, turning back to the forgotten textbook. \"So, Joe never mentioned what you're going to be doing tomorrow,\" he starts. I sigh, turning around to look at him. \"It doesn't matter, honestly. If all goes well, I won't have to do anything,\" I reply. Joe doesn't like the guys knowing that there's a medic waiting, because then they think that they are all going to die. \"I mean, I think it does matter; if you're part of this it, must be for something important.\" \"Honestly, it's not important,\" I shrug. \"I don't believe that,\" he declares after a pause. \"And why not?\" I ask, turning around to face him. \"Because if it wasn't important you would have told me.\" \"You got me,\" I surrender, going back to my book. \"So are you going to tell me?\" he asks. I glance up and he is watching me with curious eyes. \"We don't- I don't normally tell guys. It gets them freaked out. Like seriously freaked out. And especially the night before, they act like I jinxed them,\" I ramble. \"Trust me Silver Surfer, I think I can handle it.\" \"Okay,\" I agree. I take a deep breathe, thinking about how I was going to word this nicely. \"I um, I'm there for the aftermaths, the same way Joe deals with you guys before, and Eddie is there while everything is happening; I'm there for the end.\" \"So what, do you make travel plans then?\" he asks. \"No, I don't make the fucking travel plans,\" I snap. I take a moment to collect myself before continuing \"Joe had me learn... things.\" \"What type of things?\" \"You really don't want to know.\" \"Oh, so we're back to this whole thing. For christ's sake, just tell me what you do.\" \"Fine, you want to know so badly? I'm there in case any of you get shot or shoot each other. I can keep any of you sorry lowlives alive long enough to get you on a plane and out of the states.\" \"And does this happen often, guys being shot?\" \"Nearly every single fucking time. I don't know what has happened, but in the past year the cops have gotten good, and I mean real good. Someone comes back tagged every goddamn time, that is if they aren't already dead on site.\" \"Well shit.\" \"See, I knew you would say that!\" I exclaim, getting off of the bed and pacing the small room. \"This is why I don't tell you guys. You all say that, and get that look on your face. And you get scared. And that's exactly what you don't need. You can't be scared going in there because then something will go bad. And once something goes bad, more things go bad. And that can't happen!\" My pacing is stopped by him standing in front of me and grabbing me by the shoulders. \"Silver, you need to stop, and take a deep breath,\" he says. I follow his instructions, taking one breath after another. \"I'm not worried.\" \"How can you not be?!\" I ask, breaking away from him. \"You are about to risk your life, and do an insane stupid job, for what, a few thousand bucks? Trust me, it's not worth it, ever. None of this is worth it. And I can tell this is your first time. Don't you dare try to tell me it isn't because I've seen you every week at that comic book store, and you're not this. You're so much better than stooping this low. How can you not be worried? How?\" I ask feeling tears prick up behind my eyes. I don't know why I care so much what he thought, but for some reason he's not like the other guys I've seen on jobs. \"Listen to me,\" he says, pulling me towards the bed. He takes back his post against the headboard while I sit crossed legged at the end. \"You see this?\" he asks, pulling off the wedding band that was on his finger. I nod. \"My fiance and I got them this Christmas. We realized we couldn't stay, if we wanted to get married. I told him I would find a way to get us to Amsterdam. Things are better over there, less judgement. And well, when Joe rang up, I knew that I could do this, and save him and myself from this hell.\" \"What's his name?\" I ask. I was slightly surprised, but it wasn't like it was unheard of. \"Adam,\" he says, a ghost of a smile flickering across his features. \"You must really love him,\" I say, seeing the way he lights up talking about Adam. \"Yeah,\" he sighs lighting another cigarette. \"What about you?\" \"What about me?\" I ask, confused. \"You're cute enough, you have anyone hanging around?\" \"Oh. No. It's pretty hard to bring a guy home to Joe.\" \"Who said you stayed the night at your place with them?\" He winks. I splutter out a few mumbled words, feeling the blood rush up my cheeks. \"Ah, still a virgin I see.\" \"Am not,\" I argue, trying to regain some dignity. \"Silver, has anyone told you you can't lie?\" \"Every single day,\" I sigh, thinking of Vic and Eddie accusing me of falling for the guy in front of me. We fall into a silence; I return to my textbook for what seems like the tenth time, and he continues smoking, the familiar scent blanketing the room. \"Question?\" I ask, giving up on the textbook after ten minutes of letters and numbers dancing around the pages. \"Shoot.\" \"So, like, if everyone was a dog, like all different breeds, what do you think everyone would be?\" I ask. \"Where is this coming from?\" \"I don't know,\" I shrug, \"but what do you think?\" \"Let me see… you're definitely a Jack Russell Terrier.\" He smirks. \"Okay okay, could be worse. But if I'm a terrier, you're a golden retriever.\" \"And why would u say that?\" he asks, taking a long drag on his cigarette. \"The hair,\" I say, gesturing to his hair that was falling over his forehead. \"Well, Larry- fuck!\" I swear loudly. He just smirks. \"Mr. White is an English bulldog, no question about it. \" \"Okay, Mr. Pink is a Pitbull; lots of bark, but no bite.\" \"Fair enough. You know what, I think Mr. Blues a schnauzer, with a the moustache and everything,\" I add, barely containing my laughter. \"Eddies a pug.\" \"No way,\" I argue, \"He's totally a chihuahua.\" \"How could you say that, the pug in him is so obvious.\" \"I mean, first of all your wrong, second of all he's a chihuahua. All he does is yammer on and on, but he's not a real threat to anything. Couldn't even kill a housefly if his life depended on it. At least a pug is cute. Chihuahuas look like devil rats.\" \"Don't you think you're being a bit harsh?\" he asks between wheezes of laughter. \"You can't honestly believe Eddie is attractive in any way?\" \"Well, no,\" he agrees. \"Well then, who do you think is hot? Like out of this crayon box.\" I grin as he sighs, slouching into the bed even more, exasperation clear across his face. \"Damn, gotta actually think now.\" He takes a final drag on his cigarette before stubbing it out. \"Or easier question, who isn't?\" I ask, quirking an eyebrow. \"Soul patches are gross. So that rules out Mr. Brown and Mr. Pink, plus Mr. Pink is just down right annoying. Mr. Blue and Joe and both too old. But Eddie is the worst out out all of them.\" \"So that leaves Blonde, White and me, of course,\" I add with a hair flip. \"Mr. Blonde and Mr. White both have their charms. And trust me, if I was straight and you were a bit older, we wouldn't be talking right now,\" he adds with a wolfish grin. \"Oh really?\" I ask, smirking. \"Hey, I'm out of the game and Daddy wanted me to tell you that we're leaving here at nine- Oh, Mr. Orange you're here…?\" Eddie asks. \"Don't you start,\" I threaten, getting off of the bed and crossing over to him. \"Calm down, I'm not looking for trouble,\" Eddie says, backing out of the room, \"Just make sure to use protection,\" he adds before slamming the door. I groan, sliding against the wall onto the floor. \"What are you laughing at?\" I ask, rolling onto my stomach and propping myself up on my elbows. He just continues laughing, nearly throwing himself off of the bed. \"This isn't funny.\" I insist. \"You're just so…\" He finishes by gesturing at me. \"What does that even mean?\" I ask exasperated, but he just starts laughing again. \"Forget I even asked,\" I grumble, sitting in the arm chair in the corner of the room. Eddie coming into the room reminded me of what was going to happen tomorrow. There was most likely a rat, I had determined that much, but I couldn't pinpoint who. There would definitely be blood, that was nearly a given by now. I sigh, thinking of the jeans and white shirt I had with me; wishful thinking, I guess. There would be a lot of shouting as well: this box was too high strung to prevent fighting. \"Hey, what's wrong?\" he asks, bringing me out of my head. \"Oh. Just thinking. About stuff.\" I shrug. \"You looked worried, do you want to talk?\" \"I guess,\" I start, biting my lip. \"I guess I am worried. I have a very bad feeling about tomorrow. And I shouldn't be spilling all of this to you, but I seriously doubt any success in all of this. The past months the cops have been faster and faster, and these guys haven't been as lucky. And to add to all of that I'm willing to bet anything that there's a rat. I know it, I don't know how, but I can just tell. I guess I'm just worried about everything this time,\" I sigh. \"I wouldn't worry yourself sick. No matter what happens, you will just have to remember that it could be worse.\" \"Yeah, that's one way of looking at it,\" I agree. \"The best thing would be for you to sleep.\" \"Hmm, probably.\" I grin, looking at the clock. It's half past one, which means that everything would be done and over in less than twelve hours. \"You get some rest, alright?\" he says, walking over to the door. I follow him, planning on locking the door when he leaves. I don't need anymore visitors until nine in the morning. \"And try not to worry so much Avery, you're just going to stress yourself out even more.\" I glare at him, confused on how he learned by name. \"It was on your homework,\" he explains. \"Oh, well goodnight…\" I trail off. \"Freddy,\" he adds, before slipping out the door. A/N Helllllooooooo, as always review review review![Chapter 8] A/N As per usual I don't own anything you recognize. \"Avery, Avery, Avery - didn't Joe ever tell you to not to run from your problems?\" Vic teases towering above me. I focus on breathing, making sure I don't move my arm that's still throbbing. \"Tsk, tsk, I thought we had taught you to be more polite to adults. And especially not to lie to them.\" I see his blade flash under the shaky glow of the streetlights. It's the same one that he used on that cop. I am going to die. He is going to kill me. I start sobbing, nothing can help me now. Vic grins even more menacingly, enjoying my distress. Fuck.I look around me, trying to find anything that can give me a last fight. I try to focus on my surroundings, but all I can see his Vic moving closer, his lips moving in some typical monologue. I almost laugh at how surreal this is. I feel like I have seen him do this at least a hundred times, but never from this perspective. I feel something round and cold against my leg. A bottle. Glass. I make a grab for it, shattering it in the process. Vic is nearly on top of me, his blade poised and ready. I bring the shards of glass up in front of me just as he brings his blade down. I shut my eyes as I brance preparing for pain. Nothing. I open my eyes to see Vic fall onto the pavement, my glass shard deep into his neck. I cry out, watching Vic's chest slow until it doesn't rise again. I grab the fence pulling myself up until I am standing above him. I have to leave. I know I have to leave. I stumble slowly out of the ally, bracing myself against the walls of the building. On the main road, the rising sun blinds me. The sky is a soft orange with pink clouds. Pink. Orange. Freddy. I look down the street, and then turn right. I need to get to Freddy. I stumble down the road for what feels like an eternity, cradling my arm as every steps sends a new wave of pain throughout my body. The lobby of the hospital is empty. I glance at a clock above the nurses station. Six in the morning, changing of the shifts. I continue down the hallway, relying on sheer luck to bring me to Freddy's room. If he is even here. This is stupid. He won't be here. This is the biggest hospital in L.A. and there was no way I'll happen upon him. I change my plans. The morgue. I can make it to the morgue, and then by the time anyone will find me, I will be dead, with everyone else. I continue down the hallway, pausing every few feet to make sure I don't fall over. And then I hear it: his laugh and sarcastic tones. I fall into the room, nearly stumbling into a cop standing by the door. And the room goes silent. \"I killed him,\" I sob into the quiet room, looking directly at Freddy. The room ignites into actions. Freddy is attempting to get out of the hospital bed he is in, and Holdaway and another cop are forcing him down. Shit, Holdaway is going to be mad. More cops are pulling me one way and another, until one grabs my arm and the pain becomes unbearable. \"STOP IT!\" Freddy shouts, stilling the room. \"Everyone stop for just one goddamn minute! Now Avery, come here.\" I move forward into the room of cops until I am standing next to Freddy and Holdaway. \"What happened?\" \"I-I…\" I pause, fully realizing what I did. \"I killed Vic.\" I say, brushing tears, and surprisingly blood off of my face. \"Where?\" Holdaway asks. \"I don't know, it was in an ally.\" \"Where? What can you say about it? Do you remember anything?\" Holdaway asks again, grabbing my arm. I wince, cradling my arm closer to my chest. \"I don't know. There was a fence and- I don't know.\" Freddy exhales sharply. \"Holdaway, you take the boys and go see what you can find,\" Freddy says calmly, \"and get a nurse in here for her,\" he adds. \"I'm leaving Anderson and Rosen with you,\" Holdaway says. \"No way, not happening.\" \"Newendyke, I'm not leaving the two of you here, alone,\" Holdaway argues. \"Trust me on this one,\" Freddy says. \"Alright. Rosen, McCluskey, Wittle, and Harple, you will go out and check around here going outwards. Anderson, Boreman, Jennings and I will start around her house. Radio if you find anything,\" Holdaway commands. All of the cops exit the room until it is just me Freddy and Holdaway. \"Dont worry, I got this.\" Freddy grins. \"Don't cause those nurses too much trouble now,\" Holdaway warns before leaving. \"Avery, are you okay? What hurts?\" Freddy asks softly. \"My arm,\" I say, pausing to see what else hurts. I start at my feet, fine. The upper part of my left leg had blood covering it. My ribs ache, but they aren't broken. \"My arm is dislocated. My leg, it needs stitches. I think I might have a concussion, I'm not sure. I probably shouldn't sleep just in case,\" I say, feeling my heart beating in my ears. \"Avery, Avery, calm down. Okay. Just focus on breathing okay? Avery just breathe.\" I follow his instructions trying to match my breaths to his. \"Good, that's good. Now Avery, there are some nurses here. They are going to take you into another room and-\" \"No!\" I shout. \"No, I'm not going. I don't need the nurses. I'm not going.\" \"Detective, we need to move her into a room,\" a nurse says. \"Kathy, she's not going to move. So you can either help her here, which is what I'm sure everyone would prefer, or you can give her a med kit and I'm positive she will start patching herself up.\" \"Alright, I'll go get some things and I'll be right back. Make sure she doesn't move,\" the nurse adds before leaving. \"Avery, you still okay? The nurses will be here and then we can talk okay? Avery?\" \"Yeah?\" I ask quietly, exhaustion taking over. Freddy starts talking again, but I can't follow what he's saying. All I can think about is Vic. Vic yelling at me in the office. Vic chasing me out of the house. Vic walking towards me, and then towering above me. Vic grinning as he held his knife above me. Vic laying face up, glass coming out of his neck. Vic. \"Avery.\" Freddy's voice breaks me out of my thoughts. \"Avery, what's wrong? Does it still hurt? You're crying, what's wrong?\" \"I killed him,\" I whisper. The nurses have left again, this time for good. My arm is in a sling and there are stitches along my leg. I had been moved onto a chair next to his bed. \"I didn't mean to. He was going to kill me, I think. He- he had his blade out, just like the cop.\" \"Avery, shhhs, you don't have to talk about it,\" Freddy says. \"I thought I could do it, you know? I thought I would be able to make it until June without doing that. It wasn't what I wanted to do, but then again what I want never really mattered.\" \"Avery, what are you talking about?\" \"Vic. Killing. It wasn't my job. That what everyone else worried about, but not me.\" \"That was your first...?\" Freddy trails off. I nodded. \"I thought that you had...\" Freddy trailed off again. \"It was Joe's idea,\" I start. \"If I didn't actually do anything illegal, and for some reason was caught, everything I did would be seen as Joe forcing me to do it. But that's fucked now. I'm seventeen, basically eighteen. That means trial as an adult. And that means jail time no matter what. And with it just being me and Pink, the charges for the whole heist will be split. Jurors will see Cabot as my name and the prosecutors will make an impossible case against me, and I will get more time for everything Joe has done. And then-\" \"Avery...\" \"You don't understand! I did this to myself. This wouldn't be happening if I just let him kill me!\" I shout. \"Avery don't say that.\" \"Why the hell shouldn't I? It's true! What am I doing, pretending that I am some victim of circumstance or whatever you are going to say?! It's not true! I was a part of this as much as Eddie or Joe or anybody! I should be in a fucking cell somewhere, not casually sitting around in hospitals like everything's just dandy!\" \"Is that what you want? Is that what you actually think you deserve?\" Freddy challenges. \"Yeah, I guess I do!\" I snap back at him. \"It's the only thing you can do with me. You can take all the information you want from me and then just throw me in a cell for the rest of my life, I wouldn't complain.\" \"We don't just want to use you. How could you even think that?\" Freddy asks, worry obvious across his face. \"You seemed perfectly fine just getting easy information out of me that night in the hotel! Was anything you told me true?! Or did you just sit there and lie to me?!\" \"Okay, so I wasn't perfectly honest-\" \"You can say that again! You're a fucking cop! What else did you leave out?\" I ask, glaring at him. \"Well the ring is real. But me and Adam split after college, but there was a plan to go to Amsterdam at one point.\" \"Oh,\" I say, speechless. \"But what happens, happens. There's always more guys, you know? That's the great thing, no matter what there's always something around the corner.\" \"I'm sorry,\" I apologize, dropping my eyes to stare at the floor. He was right, there was always something around the corner, but it wasn't always something good. For him it meant life spent behind a desk. For me, rough female prison. \"Oh no, don't worry about it, that was years ago.\" Freddy shrugs. \"No, I'm sorry. You are here, in the hospital, and it's my fault.\" I say. And I know it's true. I should never have left him when everyone came into the warehouse. I could have blocked him from everything. I could have taken the bullet. I should have taken the bullet. \"Avery, I chose to be an undercover cop. I chose to take this case. What happened to me, those were because of my decisions. I would be dead. I know that I should have bled out. Honestly, I should be apologizing to you.\" \"Why?\" \"Your dad and your brother are dead. You're an orphan now. It's my fault really. It was a shitty cover story with too many holes. Wait- why are you laughing?\" Freddy asks. \"Sorry, but Joe's not my father; never was and never will be. Neither was Eddie,\" I say, grinning slightly. \"You don't get to claim that you orphaned me, some other cop gets that.\" \"So, a cop shot both of your parents and Joe picked you up?\" Freddy asks, quirking an eyebrow. \"Oh, no. My mom died first, drive by shooting. They saw her in one of Joe's cars and just started shooting. Joe and my dad and Larry were all friends. And then a heist goes bad, because of a rat, and dad gets shot by a rookie cop. Joe picks me up from daycare that day and the rest is history.\" I say offhandedly. It's a story that's been told to me so many times it doesn't feel like my story. \"You're basically Batman.\" \"I thought I was the Silver Surfer.\" \"Holdaway,\" Freddy says, suddenly looking towards the door. Freddy and Holdaway exchange a series of glances before Holdaway clears his throat. \"We found Vega in the alleyway between third and seventh. M.E. declared him dead between 4:30 and 5 AM this morning. There was glass in his neck that we are pulling prints from now. We will need a full statement from Avery in 24 hours max.\" \"We can do that later,\" Freddy shrugs. \"No, I want to do it now,\" I declare, sitting up straighter in the chair. \"You don't have to,\" Freddy says. \"If I do it now, can it be the only time I have to tell everything? I don't care if you have to bring in a million people, but I don't think I will be able to do it more than once,\" I tell Holdaway. And honestly I don't think I could. \"Okay, I will find some paper and a pen,\" Holdaway says leaving the room. \"I just have to write everything down right?\" I ask, starting to doubt if it was a good idea to even give a statement. \"Yeah, easy, just like an essay for school,\" Freddy shrugs. \"I hate school,\" I mutter, looking at the paper and pen Holdaway put in front of me. \"Just start when you encountered Vega, and go from there,\" Holdaway says before turning his attention to Freddy. I pick up the pen, twirling it in between my fingers before bringing it down to the page. Just like an essay. I write my name at the top of my paper: Avery Cabot . I pause, and then cross everything out. I start again and write Avery . Below that I add the date Thursday, April 25th, 1991 . Pfft, the easy part was over with now. I look up at Freddy but he is already in a deep conversation with Holdaway and another cop. Well, here goes nothing, I think starting to write. A/N So this is the second to last chapter, not including an epilogue. If you guys are interested in seeing an epilogue, let me know in the comments.[Chapter 9] A/N Happy Friday! Soooo, this is unofficially the last chapter! Woohoo! And with that being said, here is the disclaimer: Anything you recognize, I don't own. :) \"You look awful,\" Joe comments as we pull out of the parking lot. \"I didn't sleep well,\" I say. More like I didn't sleep at all, but he didn't need to know that. \"You didn't eat either,\" Joe adds. \"I was thinking,\" I shrug. I didn't notice that I didn't eat at breakfast. I was focusing too much on which one of the guys would be dead and which ones I would have to save. \"There must be a lot going on in your head then. You want to share?\" Joe asks. He made it sound optional, but it wasn't. \"I'm not a hundred percent on this one,\" I say after what feels like an eternity. \"Why?\" \"Oh, um. Well,\" I stall, trying to put everything together in a logical matter. Joe doesn't do emotion, especially not on job days. \"The cops have been getting closer and closer. And there's a lot of tempers in this group.\" \"All true. Which is why things are happening a little different this job. Me and Eddie will not be in the warehouse with you. Too much risk.\" \"Wait, what's happening?\" I ask, turning to face him completely. \"You're going to be at the warehouse, waiting. The boys are set to go in at 11, and they should be getting to you soon after that. You need to keep them there and calm, with the diamonds, until nightfall. And then go on to the airport after dark. There's too many of you to be moving by daylight.\" \"I don't know about that. If one of them gets injured, bad, I don't think I can keep them…\" I trail off. \"If they die, leave them, after we are gone, one of the boys will go and clean everything up.\" \"Joe really, I don't like this at all. At least leave Eddie around or something, there's just too many of them. And-\" \"Avery, there are other things that need to be handled. You have bare the brunt of this one.\" \"What's going on?\" I ask worrying again. \"You don't need to worry about that, just focus on the guys and the diamonds,\" Joe says, stopping the car outside of the warehouse. \"Joe,\" I say, looking at the warehouse, \"I think there's a rat,\" I say finally. \"Me too, kid. That's why the sudden change of plans. we can talk about this later.\" I sigh, getting out of the car and grabbing the backpack that held all of the medical stuff. \"Oh, and Avery,\" Joe says after I have walked halfway to the warehouse. \"Get inside and stay there. Just stay inside,\" he adds before he pulls out of the parking lot. I look around the parking lot, the neighboring buildings and up and down the street. There's one car, at the far end of the block, and two men, sitting at a window across the street. Damn. I dash across the lot, and shut the door of the warehouse behind me. I drop my bag next to a ramp across from the door, and continue into the warehouse. There's a couple of rooms filled with boxes, and another with lockers and benches. At the end of the hallway is a staircase leading up. There's a small crawl space stuffed to the top with boxes. I open one up to see hundreds of pocket sized bibles. I open the next one to see the same thing. The third box holds even more bibles. I shudder, pushing the boxes back and climbing down the stairs. I go back down to main area of the white house, and begin pacing. I can't help it, waiting for someone to return is the absolute worse. Sixty-three steps from the ramp to the doorway. Sixty-three steps from the doorway to the ramp. The sound of the door slamming against the wall has me drawing my gun and turning on my heels. \"Av-avery,\" Freddy mutters as Larry half carries half drags him into the warehouse. Larry was telling him how strong he was, but all I can focus on is the red covering both of them. \"What happened?\" I ask as Larry lowers Freddy onto the ramp. I wince seeing how much blood there is. Lower abdomen is bad. The chances that the bullet, I'm guessing it's a bullet but I'm not paying attention to what Larry is telling me, ripped through one of his organs is too big for me to be comfortable. \"This is bad,\" I say mostly to myself. \"No shit this is bad, he has a fucking bullet in his goddamn belly!\" Larry shouts. I get up, drawing myself to full height to give him my best glare. \"Just shut up right now! If you are just going to freak out and be completely useless you can just go stand over there!\" I shout pointing towards the next room over. \"What can I do to help?\" Larry asks relaxing slightly. \"Grab my bag, and hand me stuff as I tell you to alright?\" I say, sinking to my knees next to Freddy. Shit shit shit. Breathe, you got this. I start loosening his tie and unbuttoning his shirt all while telling him that's he's going to be okay. \"Shit, Avery,\" Freddy says, reaching up and placing his hand on my face. \"Am I going to die?\" \"No,\" I tell him. \"I hope not,\" I add in a whisper. \"Gauze, I need gauze,\" I tell Larry, holding out my hand. \"Now,\" I add, soaking the gauze pieces in alcohol. \"I'm sorry,\" I say to Freddy before pressing the drenched cotton into his stomach. He starts screaming, promoting Larry to cover his mouth. \"Careful, he needs to breathe. Force something into his mouth, I don't want him biting of his tongue,\" I say. Larry does that, shoving another piece of gauze into Freddy mouth. I roll back on my heels staring at the wound in front of me. It's still bleeding, slowly leaking out of him, forming crimson rivers on the ground. I can see the bullet glinting under the fluorescent lights of the warehouse. \"What are you going to do?\" Larry asks. I grab the bag next to me and pull out a knife, tweezers, and a needle and thread. \"I need to get the bullet out,\" I say, letting my eyes travel from Freddy's torso up to his face. His eyes, normally shimmering with an inside joke only he seemed to know, now wild and frantic. And scared. He's scared. I grab his hand, squeezing it, hard. I hold it, rubbing circles with my thumb over the top of his hand. I hum quietly waiting for him to calm down or pass out. Whatever will make nearly doing surgery on him easier. \"This will only hurt for a few minutes, I promise.\" I stand up, stretching my legs, looking towards the next room where Pink and Larry are arguing. \"I'll be right back, okay?\" I tell Freddy, placing a kiss on his forehead and pushing his hair out of his eyes. \"For all I know she's the fucking rat!\" Pink shouts gesturing at me. \"I'm not a rat!\" I defend myself. \"How do I know you didn't just sit here and call the cops on us?!\" Pink asks. \"Oh for fucksake, I'm not dealling with this,\" I say, making my way past them to the sink. I begin scrub my hands, watching the water run red. Once it's clear, I dry them and go back to Freddy. He's passed out which makes everything a little better for me. I remove the gauze from both his mouth and from around the bullet hole. I grab the tweezers and dip them in alcohol. Breathe, I remind myself. I let out a shaky breath, focusing on the silver bullet lodged in Freddy's abdomen. Just a real life version of Operation, I tell myself as I move the tweezers closer. Only this time if I'm not perfect, I could kill him. Breathe. Focus. You can do this. I steady my hand and lower the tweezers into the bullet hole. I don't breathe again until the bullet is out. I drop the tweezers on the floor with the bullet. I press my hands against the wound, trying to stop the blood that is flowing freely. I look up at his chest, not seeing breathing, or hearing a heartbeat. Fuck. I look behind me, where Larry and Pink are in a heated discussion. \"Help, I need help!\" I shout, but neither of them look over. \"Pink! Now, please!\" \"What? What is it?\" Pink asks standing over me. \"Put your hands here,\" I instruct. Pink kneels on the other side of Freddy's body and places his hands over mine. I slowly remove my hands, pleased with the pressure Pink is using to stop the bleeding. I move closer to Freddy's head, positioning my knees to one side of his shoulders. I tilt his head back, checking his airways for any blockage. Satisfied with his empty mouth, I place my hands over each other and place them on his chest. \"Why bother?\" Pink asks, beginning to remove his hands. \"Don't!\" I shout, \"Leave them. I need to try.\" I begin compressions on Freddy's chest and I can hear Pink counting each compression out loud. After fifteen, I lean over Freddy's head, pinch his nose, and place my mouth on his to give two breaths. I begin compressions again, and Pink counts as we cycle through compressions and breaths. \"Face it Silver, he's dead,\" Pink says when I go to give more breathes. I shake my head, refusing to stop CPR. I go back to compressions when I hear it, a shuttering breath and a cough. I hold his head waiting for his to open his eyes. Freddy's groan is nearly music to my ears. \"Shhh, it's okay, it's going to be okay,\" I tell him. I grab my suture kit and situate myself next to the wound. \"Go, he's fine,\" I tell Pink. He immediately gets up and heads into the next room. Water starts running seconds after Pink leaves my sight. \"Hmmm,\" I hum, not sure if I'm talking for myself or Freddy's sake. \"Okay, this will hurt a bit,\" I say as I bring my finger into the wound. I'm checking for any damage to his organs, and therefore it's necessary, but by the way Freddy is screaming I can tell he thinks differently. \"It's over,\" I tell him, removing my hand. \"It's okay. You're okay. You really lucky. That bullet wasn't deep, missed your organs. Got stuck in your abs,\" I tell him while I thread the suture through its needle. I begin a locking-stitch, starting at the bottom. His screaming starts loud and painful, but quiets to pained moans as I close his wound. \"Good, good, all done,\" I tell Freddy as I tie off the stitches. His eyes flutter again before closing. I take his hand in mine and find a steady pulse. I stand, looking down at myself to asses the damage. My once white shirt now looks like a morbid tie-dye and my jeans are stiff with blood. I look around, fully taking in what the two men in front of me were discussing. A rat. Cops. Everything going wrong. I look away from the petty argument and towards the front of the warehouse. I begin walking towards the doors and Vic, who by the looks of it just walked in. \"Where were you?\" I ask once I am close enough to him that I don't have to shout across the room. \"What happened to you?\" Vic asks. I look back at Freddy and shrug. \"Bullet to the stomach, I guess. He's fine now, no internal bleeding. But he did die for a little bit, so I'm not happy with that. But he's alive again.\" \"So none of this is you?\" Vic asks, gesturing to the blood that's nearly everywhere. \"No. God no. I'm fine. He's going to be hard to move though,\" I say, looking over my shoulder again. I can see the Freddy's shallow breathing. \"Where's Joe and Eddie?\" Vic asks, taking a sip out of the soda he has. \"Not here,\" I say, shifting from one foot to the other. \"Well you could have told me they wouldn't be here at breakfast.\" \"I didn't know until Joe dropped me off.\" I counter. \"Is it true-?\" I start to ask before Vic cuts me off. \"One sec, let me handle these fuckers,\" Vic says, walking over to Larry and Pink. I follow him, but veer left to check on Freddy. I sit higher up on the ramp, away from the blood, and run my fingers through his hair. Still breathing. I begin sorting through my bag of supplies, wiping off things that can be used again and separating them from anything that needs to be disposed of. I look up to see the three of them walking towards the door. I get up hurrying towards the door to cut them off. \"Where are you going?\" I ask Vic, who is closest. \"Don't worry about it, I'm just showing them something in the car,\" Vic smirks. I start to protest, but Vic and Pink are already out the door. Larry gives me an apologetic look before following them out. I stand at the doorway, gun in hand, watching as they walked across the lot towards the car Vic obviously stole. They all stop, looking into the trunk of the car. I look around, noticing the car from earlier has moved closer to the warehouse, but not close enough for me to see into it. I scan the surrounding buildings counting three different buildings that had someone, most likely a cop, standing in the windows. I look back at the three surrounding the car and watch as the pull a cop out of the trunk and start dragging him towards me and the door. I step aside, letting Pink and Larry drag the cop in. \"This was stupid,\" I tell Vic, keeping him from going in. \"What?\" Vic asks. I gesture with my eyes to the three buildings and the car up the street. \"Don't worry, Eddie will be here soon,\" Vic shrugs, bringing me into the warehouse with him and closing the door. \"What's your plan with him?\" I ask as we watch Larry and Pink take turns beating the life out of the cop. \"Do you have any duct tape with you?\" Vic asks. I nodd. \"Go get it, we need to restrain it.\" I walk over to my bag, grabbing the silver tape. I hand it to Vic, who begins taping the cop to the chair. Once done, Vic steps back until he is next to me and we watch as Pink and Larry alternate shouting and hitting the cop. I wince as a particularly hard hit leaves the cop fighting to stay awake. \"Do you think it's true, that there's a rat?\" I ask Vic, not looking away from the cop. \"What do you think, kid?\" \"Joe's not here,\" I add. \"Exactly,\" Vic says stoically. \"Do you think he will show?\" I ask. \"Not unless he has to, but this might force his hand,\" Vic says looking between the cop and Freddy. \"He's going to be pissed.\" \"Not unless that fucker gives us some real information.\" \"Please, we both knows that's not going to happen. He's going to say anything if you hit him hard enough,\" I say, looking at the heavily bruised and bloodied cop. He is just repeating himself now, but Larry and Pink aren't listening. \"Where is everyone?\" I ask, noticing for the first time that we are two short. \"Mr. Brown is dead, and they think the same of Mr. Blue,\" Vic says. \"We don't know anything yet,\" I say, mostly to reassure myself. One dead isn't bad. One confirmed dead, one hypothesized dead, one injured, and one rat is bad. I glance over at Freddy again and can make out his shallow breathing from across the room. \"What in Sam Hill's going on here?\" Eddie asks, walking in. Larry and Pink freeze and turn towards Eddie. I look up at Vic who looks slightly amused by the whole situation. Eddie scans the room taking in the cop; the blood that covers myself, Larry and Pink; Vic's nonchalant attitude; and lastly Freddy laying at the base of the ramp in his own blood. \"Nice Guy, we got a cop,\" Pink says, like it's something to be proud of. \"Where the fuck is Joe?\" Larry asks next. \"Holy shit. Orange is dead,\" Eddie exclaims. \"No, he's not,\" I sigh, \"There's just a lot of blood.\" \"We were set up. The cops were there waitin' for us,\" Pink insists. \"What? Nobody fucking set anybody up,\" Eddie says. \"The cops were there waiting for us!\" Pink shouts. \"Bullshit!\" \"Fuck you, man!\" \"You weren't there, we were, and the cops had that store staked out!\" Larry adds. \"Okay Mr. Fucking Detective, if you're so fucking smart, who did it?\" Eddie asks, getting mad now. \"We've been asking each other!\" \"And what did you come up with? You think I fucking set you up!\" Eddie shouts. \"I don't know, but somebody did!\" Pink snarls. \"Nobody did! You fucking assholes turned the jewelry store-!\" \"Don't you call me an asshole!\" Larry interrupts. \"You fucking idiot ! Turned the jewelry store into a wild west show and you wonder why the fucking cops show up?\" \"Where's Joseph?\" Vic asks from next to me. \"I don't know, I ain't talk to him. I talked to Dov. He say Daddy's coming down here and he's fucking pissed.\" \"He's pissed? I told you he'd be pissed,\" Pink says to no one. \"What'd Joe say?\" Larry asks. \"I told you, I ain't talked to him! All I know is he's pissed,\" Eddie says. \"What are you going to do about him?\" Larry asks, gesturing at Freddy. \"Give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few of my own questions here.\" \"You ain't dying. He is,\" Larry counters. \"No, he's not,\" I say again, louder, but I'm still ignored. \"Alright Mr. Fucking-Compassion, I'll call somebody!\" \"Who?\" Larry asks. I feel like smacking my head against the wall at everyone's stupidity right now. He isn't fucking dying. \"A fucking snake charmer! Who do you think? I'll call a doctor,\" Eddie says. For fuck's sake. \"He doesn't need a fucking doctor!\" I shout, easily getting everyone's attention. \"He's fine. He's not fucking dying. We should be more concerned with everything else than with him. Because he isn't! Fucking! Dying!\" \"That settles it then. Moving on-\" Eddie declared. \"How the fuck does that settle! You're not seriously going to believe what she says! He was dead. Link him up to a hospital machine and he would have flatlined! Just because she used some girl scout CPR doesn't mean he doesn't need a doctor!\" Pink shouts. I step forward, about to tell Mr. Pink where he can shove his lousy opinion, but Vic's vice grip on my arm holds me back. \"Are you a fucking doctor? No. Silver practically is. If she says he's going to be fine, he's going to be fine. Now what happened Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?\" \"Brown's dead. We don't know what happened to Blue.\" Pink says. \"Brown's dead? Are you sure?\" Eddie asks. \"I'm sure. I was there. He took one in the head,\" Larry adds. \"Nobody's got a clue what happened to Mr. Blue?\" Eddie asks, looking at everyone. \"Either he's alive, or he's dead, or the cops got him, or they don't,\" Vic deadpans from behind me. \"I take it this is the bastard you told me about. Why are you beating on him?\" Eddie asks. \"Maybe he could tell us who set us up,\" Pink states. \"You beat this prick long enough, he'll tell you he started the Chicago fire. Now that doesn't necessarily make it fucking so!\" Eddie shouts. I roll my eyes at this. \"Come on man, think!\" \"All right, first things fucking last! Who's got the stones? Please, somebody tell me one little fucking favor,\" Eddie pleads. \"I got a bag. I stashed it 'til we could be sure this place wasn't a fucking police station,\" Pink says. \"Good for you. Now let's go get it,\" Eddie says, perking back up to his usual self. \"First we got to get rid of those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.\" \"Okay.\" \"Now Blondie, stay here and baby-sit them two. White and Pink take a car each. I'll follow you. You ditch them. Pick up the stones.\" Eddie says. \"You can't leave these guys here with him!\" White says gesturing at myself, Freddy and the cop. \"Why not?\" Eddie asks. \"Because he's a fucking psycho! And if you think Joe is pissed off, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed I am at him for putting me in the same room as that bastard!\" Larry shouts. \"You see what I've been putting up with Eddie? I fucking walk in here, I told these guys about staying put, Mr. White whips out his gun, he's sticking it in my face, calling me a motherfucker, saying he going to blow me away, and blah blah blah blah blah,\" Vic says completely cool and collected. \"He's the reason the joint turned into a shooting spree,\" Larry says. \"What are you, a fucking silent partner? Tell him!\" Larry adds turning on Pink. \"He went crazy in the store, but he seems alright now,\" Pink shrugs. \"This is what he was doing,\" Larry says, making a finger gun, \"Bam. Bam.\" \"Yeah, bam bam bam bam bam. I told them not to touch the fucking alarm, they did. If they hadn't have done what I told them not to do, they'd still be alive,\" Vic responds. \"My fucking hero,\" Larry says, walking towards Vic and I, clapping. \"Thanks,\" Vic shoots back. \"That's your excuse for going on a kill-crazy rampage?\" Larry asks. \"I don't like alarms Mr. White,\" Vic says. \"What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't letting him go. He's seen everybody,\" Eddie says. \"I haven't been looking at you guys,\" the cops says. I cover my mouth to keep myself from laughing at that. \"Shut the fuck up man!\" Pink shouts punching the cop in the face. \"You guys never should have taken him out of the trunk in the first place,\" Eddie says. \"We tried to find out about the set up,\" Pink says again. \"There was no fucking set up! Now here's the news. Blondie, Silver, you'll stay here and take care of these two! White and Pink, you come with me, 'cause if Joe gets here and sees all the cars parked outside, I swear to you he's going to be just as mad at me as he is at you!\" \"Fine, let's go,\" Pink says as he follows Eddie out of the warehouse. Larry says something to Freddy before leaving as well. \"Alone at last,\" Vic says, taking off his jacket and moving towards the cop. I hurry to keep up with him, moving to stand in front of him. \"Blonde,\" I say, the name feeling fake. I rarely used the code names given. They were a good idea, but I didn't want to have to call the men I considered family by stupid names. \"Please, don't do this,\" I plead watching as he moves even closer to the cop. \"Don't you have a paintent to be attending to, Silver?\" Vic asks, his eyes hardening on the last word. I turn on my heel and walk back over to Freddy. This wasn't my place, and Vic was making that clear. I know things could get nasty quickly, dealing with cop hostages, although none of the jobs I had been on involved that particular aspect. I think Vic had, but I wasn't clear on how he handled things like this. The past four years that I have been going on jobs, he's been in jail for I don't know what. I sit down next to Freddy, instantly feeling for a pulse. Still alive. If anything stronger than before. I sit and watch as Vic walks around the cop, duct tape in hand. \"Look I'm not going to bullshit you, okay? I don't really give a fuck what you know or don't know, but I'm going to torture you regardless. Not to get information. It's amusing to me, to torture a cop.\" Whatever else Vic says is lost to me as I repeat his last words in my head. Amusing to torture a cop. Amusing to torture. Torture. Amusing. It's amusing to me to torture a cop. Torture a cop. I'm frozen as I watch Vic as Vic fakes the cop out with his gun, and then pull a razor out from his boot. Vic turns on the radio and begins walking towards me and Freddy. \"Is he awake?\" Vic asks, crouching down in front of us. I shake my head, unable to think of anything to actually say. \"Good.\" He grins before walking back to the cop. Not walking, dancing to the music that was now playing. I blanch and grip Freddy's hand in mine as Vic makes a slash across the cop's face. Vic straddles the cop, bringing the razor to the side of the cop's head. I watch, unable to look or even blink as Vic slowly saws his ear off. Seconds feel like hours as the cops screams get louder and Vic's smirk gets more and more sinister. Vic gets up and walks away from the cop, but I'm stuck looking between the ear on the floor and the hole in the cop's head. The slamming of the warehouse door frees me from my trance. I stand up shakely, going over to my bag and pull out a bottle of Oxycodone. I approach the cop quickly, looking over my shoulder multiple times to check if Vic was returning. I pour four of the pills into my hand. \"You need to take these,\" I say approaching him. He jerks his head back and forth trying to get away from me. I move closer, putting my hand with the pills over his mouth and my other over his nose, blocking his airways. I wait for him to open his mouth, force the pills him and then wait for him to shallow. Once he swallowed I back away. \"It will help,\" I manage to tell him before Vic returns carrying a canister of gasoline. \"What are you doing?! Are you insane? This place is filled with flammable things!\" I shout. Vic shrugs and continues walking. \"I-I can't let you do this,\" I tell him, drawing my gun and standing between the cop and him. Vic swings the gas can, hitting the gun out of my hands. He swings again, and I hear the sound of the canister hitting my head before I feel it. I stumble backwards, hitting the floor just as my vision goes completely black. Silver. Silver. Silver. Why the hell is Eddie repeating silver? Idiot. I take account of my surroundings. I'm definitely laying down on something cold. I can move my fingers and toes. My eyes are closed. Eddie is still going on about silver, and being dead. Is he talking about me? I focus on sound right now and realize that there's a lot of other people in the room, walking around. Whites and pinks and oranges. Fuck. What is Eddie going on about? God I hope he hasn't come home drunk again. I force myself to sit up and open my eyes at the same time. The first thing I notice is the nausea that keeps passing through me. Fuck. \"Silver, what happened?\" Eddie asks, three of him crouching in front of me. \"I-uh, fuck,\" I swear as nausea hits me again. \"Are you okay?\" the three Eddie's asks again. \"I'm fine,\" I say slowly, using the wall behind me to stand up. I look around the room, noting the four different people staring at me. I need to pull myself together. I focus on breathing, ignoring what Eddie is saying. \"Silver, I need you to stay with us, okay?\" Eddie says again. \"I'm fine,\" I say again, once the three Eddie's consolidate into one. I look around again, this time noticing the blood everywhere, and someone slumped against the far wall. Fuck. No one's moving to help whoever it is, so I start walking towards him. The ground moves as I walk, making the nausea return. Eddie begins shouting again. I kneel down next to the man, trying not to pass out. There are bullet holes all over his chest, and his head is down, hiding his identity. I lift his head, and have to bit down on my own hand to keep from screaming. Dead. I grab his hand, looking for any pulse and its cold. Cold and dead. I blink, trying to keep myself together. I look up and see Larry watching me. I shake my head. He's dead. I try to stand up to go help the other guy, who's name I can't remember; he's covered in blood, but my legs will not support me. I sit between the door and the body, watching but not listening or understanding as Eddie yells at the guy covered in blood. Fuck. What was his name? Fuck. Someone barges through the door, Joe, not even sparing a second to look at around him. More shouting. Everyone pulls out their guns, even the guy on the floor. Freddy. That's his name. \"LARRY STOP POINTING THAT GUN AT MY DAD!\" Eddie shouts. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. I feel frozen. I see myself standing up and stepping forward, but I am frozen. I see myself walk across the room, stepping over legs and arms. I know I am crouching down in front of Freddy and Larry, but all I can think about is the sound. The sound of the guns going off. The sound of them hitting the concrete, one by one. The sound of their guns falling afterwards. The sound of the muffle moans coming from each of them. \"Avery, Avery! Pay attention to me,\" Freddy says, grabbing my hand with his hand. I look at him, trying to process what he is saying. \"I need you to take this, and go outside. You will find help. Just show them this, and it will be okay. Avery, I need you to do this,\" Freddy pants, putting something into my hand. \"Just say that people are alive, okay?\" \"I can't leave everyone,\" I say finally. \"You will be right back, I promise. You are just going to get help. Avery, you need to do this,\" Freddy repeats. I stand up and notice for the first time that I'm shaking. Freddy slumps further into the ramp, flashing a small smile at me, telling me to go. I stumble towards the door, tripping over someone's arm. I steady myself against the wall next to door, preparing to go outside. I look down at the object in my hand, noticing for the first time that it's the engagement ring Adam gave Freddy. I push the door open and take a step out. The sunlight blinds me, and for a moment there is no noise at all. \"Step away from the building and put your hands up!\" someone shouts. I follow their instructions, taking two steps before falling to my hands and knees. I stare at the ground, trying not to pass out, when two pairs of shoes come in my vision. \"They need help. Please. They are alive,\" I breathe. I release the ring from my hands and watch as it rolls across the pavement. One of the men bend down and picks it up. He stays crouching. \"How did you get this?\" he asks, \"Who gave this to you?\" \"Orange- Freddy, Freddy gave it to me. Please. They need help, please.\" \"Detective, we need to get her away from the building,\" another cop says. I feel myself being lifted up, and walked back towards a crowd of people, but I keep looking back over my shoulder where everyone is. Someone is talking to me, or at me, but I am watching the door. No one is going in, or coming out. \"Why isn't anyone going in there?! They need help!\" I shout, trying to get back to the door. \"I need to help them? Why aren't you going in there!\" I still as the door opens. Mr. Pink jogs out, and then stops. He looks around, making eye contact with me, as one of the cops sends a bullet into his leg. I try to rush forward again, but someone stops me. I shove my elbow into the guy's gut, but he still doesn't release me. Bang The sound of the gunshot from the inside of the building finally breaks me. A/N and there we go. let me know what you think. Do you like how it ended? Do you like how it was organized? Do you want more of Avery's story, either pre-heist or post-heist.

There's not a body in sight as the sun still avoids the rise. His head pokes out his window glancing over at each house. He parks in front of a small house equipped with two chairs rocking lightly back and forth on the porch. He climbs out of the car and adjusts his grey, worn out watch cap as he slowly climbs the 5 step entrance toward the door. He takes a deep breath as he raises his hand and gently taps three times before lowering his arm. No response. He turns to stare at his old, rundown car thinking against his idea of a surprise visit. Right as he forces his body to hop into the car and drive off without turning back, the door swings open. \"Paddy?\" Paddy turns around and sees a beautiful, young face standing in front of him, door cracked enough so her face can be seen. \"Sarah.\" Paddy takes in her familiar face. So many flashbacks. \"So it's true. You really did come back to the burg.\" She nods, completely unsure of what to say. She hasn't seen this man in 13 years. Now to her, he's just a stranger with a history. \"Paddy, what are you doing here?\"Paddy looks down at his calloused hands. \"You're not gonna invite an old man in?\" He laughs. Sarah is taken back. She can't remember hearing such a genuine laugh from him before. The only ones she was used to were the ones that would follow a drunken opens the door wider signaling Paddy to enter. The entrance into Sarah's home adjoins to her kitchen which forces Paddy to walk through it before entering her spacious dining room. Sarah trails behind and notices Paddy surveying her home. \"Sit…please.\" She walks over to her coffee pot. \"Nice place,\" Paddy says as he pulls one of the dining chairs around to face Sarah and sits. \"Thanks. You want a cup of coff…\" She stops, remembering . This is not his kind of drink. Paddy notices her change in thought. \"Yea I'll have a cup. Black if you don't mind.\" \"Umm ok,\" Sarah stammers as she slowly starts putting two and two together. He sobered up. She pours two glasses, one for him and one for her. She leans on the counter while they both quietly sip their coffee. After long moments of silence, Sarah slams her mug down and folds her arms as she glares at Paddy. \"Paddy, why are you here?\" Paddy places the mug down giving his full attention to her. \"Tommy's back.\" Her hearts starts to race, her palms start to sweat, and her eyes forces tears but she fights them back. \"Tommy's back?\" Paddy nods, knowing this hit her harder than he thought it would've. \"He just got back a couple days ago. I thought you'd want to know.\" Sarah drops her arms and sips her coffee, anxious of the answer to her next question. \"Did he, uh, ask about me at all? Did he mention me?\" Paddy shakes his head. \"I'm sorry Sarah.\" Paddy says with a hint of apathy. \"Did you tell Brendan? Does he know?\" Sarah asks as a tear rolls slowly down her rosy cheek. \"No. He was going to be my next stop.\" Paddy says. She sniffs and wipes her face. \"I think you should go. I have work in a little bit so…,\" she trails off unable to look him in the eye. Paddy rises from the chair and walks to the door. He turns back to give Sarah one last glance. \"We both know Tommy holds grudges. He'll forgive you quicker than he'll forgive me.\" He turns the handle and exits. Sarah walks up to the door and leans her head on it, hoping this will help keep her from falling apart. She slides down against the door and cries into her hands, memories flooding back to her. Seems like yesterday she was standing with him at the airport five years ago staring at his pained face…[Chapter 2] Sarah walks down the alleyway and toward the entrance of Colt's Gym. She enters and sees Fenroy sitting at the front desk with his sees glued to his laptop. She can faintly hear what he's watching: J.J. Riley going on and on about Sparta. We get it. Fenroy looks up as he hears the bell from the door jingle. \"So Colt was right. You did come back. First day?\" Fenroy says with a grin on his face. \"No I just came to talk to him.\" She says as she looks into the ring. Mad Dog Grimes. She rolls her eyes and looks over at Fenroy. \"Colt still training the clown?\" Fenroy looks up from his screen. \"Yea. Everyday.\" She nods. Whatever. \"Where is he?\" She asks. Fenroy points up. \"In his office.\" She walks past the ring, avoiding eye contact with the prick Mad Dog, passes a row of punching bags, and heads up the stairs passing a man in a hoodie. The man walks towards the bench with his face covered by his hoodie. He pulls out tape from his pocket and starts wrapping his hands. Clearly this guy know what to do and how to do it. He slides off his hoodie, grabs a pair of boxing gloves, and walks to a punching bag. It's Tommy. Sarah knocks lightly on Colt's door. Colt is leaned over his cluttered desk studying the thousand papers scattered across it. He looks up and sees Sarah. \"If it isn't my favorite god daughter,\" Colt says as he walks over to hug her. Sarah smiles. \"I'm your only god daughter.\" They embrace warmly. \"Alright so you can set your stuff down over here so we—,\" Colt points towards a chair as Sarah cuts her off. \"I told you on the phone. I never said I would work here Colt.\" Sarah says, an annoying twinge in her voice. \"Oh come on. I need you to help out with some things I can't get to while I train Mad Dog for Sparta.\" Colt says desperately. \"Have you seen your gym? You have plenty of people to help you out.\" Sarah says. \"Yea they work here but I don't trust them the way I do with you.\" Colt pleads. \"Fine! Don't guilt trip me. I'll help you under one condition: your prized possession keeps his distance.\" Sarah says as she glares at Colt. \"It's been a couple years you two kids can't kiss and make up?\" Colt says as he laughs. Sarah's glare continues. \"Alright I'll be up in a little bit after this sparring session. Once he does his basic training, I'll show you what I need you to do.\" He crosses the room and exits. She hears his yelling at someone. \"Jimmy hop in the ring with Mad Dog.\" Tommy is in his zone. Sending brutal jabs left in right on the punching bag. His jaw gets hard as he bites down on his mouth guard, his punches getting harder and harder. Sarah walks down the stairs and over to Fenroy who is still hyped up on CNN's feed about Sparta. He pays no attention as she stands hands in her jean pockets in front of him. She wanders the gym: surveying several physically fit men training together, lifting weights, sparring,etc. Tommy gives his bag one final punch before pulling out his mouth guard and removing his boxing gloves. Sarah makes her way to a punching bag when she sees Tommy. Her heart stops. She's frozen in place and can't move. Her mind screams at her legs to run but she can't. He hasn't noticed her, still removing the Velcro strapping off his glove. Perfect time for her to calm herself down and run. \"HEY HEY HEY look who's back!\" Mad Dog screams so the entire gym can hear. He stares at her with a very smug look. Tommy looks up at Mad Dog then over at whatever he's looking at.[Chapter 3] Tommy stares hard at first, not making out who it is. Then his expression turns soft. Instant flashes come to him. Sarah looks at Mad Dog in disgust then turns to Tommy. Her breathing picks up. \"Zip your trap and get back to sparring. Let's go!\" Colt says not paying much attention to what happened but slowly losing patience with his prized possession. Mad Dog laughs and gets back to Colt, his sparring partner, and his crew. Sarah takes off to the nearest exit while Tommy watches her bolt out of the gym. What are the odds they would find each other here of all places after 5 years of complete disconnection? Tommy looks up at Mad Dog. He's goofing around with Jimmy; making jokes and lightly punching him while the frail man swing s and misses over and over again. Tommy's jaw is hard. He bites his bottom lip, getting fired up. He straps his gloves back on and walks back to his bag, wailing harder and harder. Sarah slams the exit door shut and grips her face as tears stream over them. 5 years without seeing his face and this is what happens… Her eyes are puffy and red as Sarah walks back into the gym. Tommy's are still transfixed on his battered punching bag, surprised it's still holding up. She avoids all eye contact as she passes the ring. She hears Mad Dog celebrating as a loud bang hits the mat. Sarah looks over and sees Jimmy laid out across the ring floor. She charges towards the ring. She's known Jimmy for a while. Nothing more than a childhood friend she talked to every now and then. \"You gotta tournament coming up. You gonna kill every guy in the Burg?\" Colt asks Mad Dog as he sees Mad Dog clapping the hands of his crew. \"God damnit Mad Dog come on!\" Sarah shouts as she gets in the ring and helps the other guys safely pick Jimmy up and take him out. \"Why you worried about it sweetheart?\" Mad Dog says while attempting to give Sarah a flirty stare. Sarah pays no mind to it as Colt talks to Fenroy on calling up people to spar with Mad Dog. Tommy looks over at the smug MMA fighter leaning on the ropes. The way he's looking over at Sarah sparks a fire in him. He rips off his left glove with his teeth and walks up to the ring. \"Yo I'll fight him.\" Sarah shoot her head at Tommy. He looks at her then up at Colt. Oh boy what the hell is he doing? \"Do me a favor guy. Go back to your bag we don't need anybody else getting' hurt. Take a walk.\" Colt turns back to Fenroy. Tommy turns around and walks back to his bag when Mad Dog makes a Rocky joke that entices Tommy. He turns back around and places his arms up on the ropes. Sarah was on her way out of the ring to maybe work up the courage to talk to Tommy but she stays in, staring intently at the two. She can't seem to understand his expression. His face is just hard. \"All I'm saying is if you need somebody to help you, I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you.\" Colt looks at Tommy; surprised at the balls on this kid. He looks over at Mad Dog who seems ready for the fight. Then he looks at Sarah. She panics as all eyes shoot to her. She throws her hands up in the air. Not really understanding why he's looking at her for some sort of approval. \"Don't look at me.\" She says. Fenroy tells Colt he's good to go and Tommy hops in the ring. Sarah makes her way out, a smile creeping on her face as she walks out of sight from the ring but still enough to catch the action. If it's the one thing she knew never changed in Tommy was his crave for a challenge and how vicious he was in any fight. She watched him do a fair share of those with her own eyes. A loud beep sounds signaling the sparring session to begin. Her eyes widen as Tommy starts the fight with a sharp right kick to Mad Dog's chest, sliding him right against the ropes. She sees Tommy take a couple punches until she smiles when he grabs Mad Dog's leg and punches him, knocking him on the ground. He wails on him while he's on the ground. It's only when he picks Mad Dog up and slams him on the ground with one arm that she cups her mouth and laughs quietly. Man he is getting his ass kicked and she gets to watch along with all the other men in the gym circling around the ring. Tommy gives Mad Dog brutal knees to the face then knocks him out cold with one punch. The gym is quiet. All eyes are on Tommy. Sarah laughs out loud, not knowing how loud it actually was. Colt glares at her. She turns and walks up the stairs knowing now all eyes are on her, even Tommy's. She runs up the stairs, not being able to stop the chuckling that continues to escape from her throat. Mad Dog has always been the cockiest person she's ever met. Always wanting her to go with him to watch him train just so she could be impressed with how ripped he thought he was. He isn't that ripped. Now Tommy, on the other hand, is. She had never seen him this beefy before. His back as wide as ever and his traps as big as she's ever see—\"What the hell was that?\" Colt breaks her train of thought and bombards into the office. \"What?\" Sarah says innocently as she turns to face him. \"The number one contender in the world just got his ass handed to him on a silver platter and you're laughing? Why?\" colt is furious. \"It was funny to me sorry.\" Sarah says, avoiding eye contacts. \"Do you know that guy?\" Colt asks. \"No…\" Sarah trails off. Colt catches on to her non discreet answer. \"Really cuz that name sounds awfully familiar.\" Colt says. \"I said no alright? Don't get into this.\" Sarah says as she plops into his office chair. \"Just tell me what you want me to do boss.\" Sarah says waiting for Colt to get over his anger. Sarah walks down the wooden stairs and back into the stomach of the gym. It's pretty much cleaned out except for the few guys going at it on the punching bag or in the ring. It's just about closing time. Mad Dog stands in the corner packing up and Tommy sits on a bench in front of a row of punching bags, unwrapping the tape from his battered hands. Sarah doesn't notice either man as she walks towards the exit. Mad Dog looks up to see her and runs toward her running right past Tommy which forces him to look and sees where he's headed. \"That was funny wasn't it?\" Mad Dog says while keeping pace behind her. She turns to see him smirking. \"What? You getting your ass whooped? Yea it made my day.\" She says with a smile. \"I heard you know that kid that got lucky.\" Mad Dog says, arms folded while attempting to be intimidating. \"What you think I got him to do that to you? I wouldn't waste my time.\" Sarah turns to walk off when Mad Dog yanks her arm back in anger. \"I don't know what kind of bullshit you're playing but—\" He's cut off by Sarah screaming. \"Get off me!\" She struggles to get her arm free from his grip. Tommy notices and bolts over to them. \"You want to get your hand off her?\" Tommy growls as he inches closer to Mad Dog. \"And if I don't?\" Mad Dog says, still smirking. \"We can go round two in there if you want.\" Tommy points to the ring. \"And that's what's about to happen if you don't release your grip man.\" Tommy gives a look that could kill a million souls. Mad Dog releases Sarah's arm and steps face to face with Tommy. Sarah studies Tommy's face. He's pretty dangerous at this point. He always had this little thing he would do with his lip and his head that reminded those he knew that he's out for blood. He would suck his bottom lip in and nod his head slowly. Sarah squeezes herself in between the two beefed up men. \"Tommy come on please don't do this.\" Sarah says through her gritted teeth, struggling to get Tommy to move. She would rather not hear anything else from Colt if Tommy ripped Mad Dog's throat out. Tommy looks down at Sarah. It's been a while since he's heard her voice let alone heard her say his name. It takes him back to a special place they used to be at. \"Listen to your girlfriend if you know what's good for you Rock.\" Tommy looks back up at Mad Dog then backs up with Sarah. He grabs her arm to stop her from pushing him back although she didn't mind touching his firm chest through his baggy hoodie. Mad Dog laughs as he exits the gym. Tommy and Sarah meet eyes. Sarah gets instant butterflies in her stomach. There is so much to say but she can't find the right words right now. Tommy admires her face, almost feeling like he's dreaming. \"I should go.\" Sarah says as she slides her arm out of Tommy's grip. Tommy nods and his changes instantly. \"Then go. No one is stopping you.\" Tommy grabs his tape from the bench and leaves. She watches with tears in her eyes. Ice cold. She exits the gym wishing she could rewind those last couple minutes…[Chapter 4] Tommy pushes opens his old room door and shuts it behind him. The room is filled with several trophies stacked on a small table in front of one bed. The other bed is left vacant. Obvious this was Brendan and Tommy's old room. He pulls off his hoodie and lays on his bed with nothing on but that beater he wore when he knocked Mad Dog out in the ring. He stares at the ceiling thinking, remembering. Angry. He sits up and swings his legs around the bed. His elbows leaned on his legs, he hangs his head tired and defeated. Sarah sits at her dining room table with a small cup of coffee. She's in a complete daze as she stares out the window. The phone rings shaking her out o her zone. For some reason she seems overly anxious to run and grab it from her sofa. \"Hello?\" she answers hoping for a certain voice. \"Hey Sarah, it's Paddy.\" She plops down on the sofa. Of course it's not Tommy. He doesn't even have her phone number. Wishful thinking. \"Hey Paddy how's it going?\" She says sounding less than enthusiastic. \"Good good. Hey I'm just calling to see if maybe you would wanna sit down for a cup of coffee and catch up on things.\" Paddy says in a low grumble. There's a slight pause. \"So cuz you're all sobered up you wanna try and make peace?\" Sarah asks, pretty pissed. \"If you would let me yes.\" Paddy says, keeping his composure. Sarah drops her arm laying the phone on her lap. She almost feels bad for saying that last comment. She knows Tommy is already giving him crap if he's seen him. She raises the phone back to her ear. \"Tomorrow at noon?\" Sarah asks. \"That's great. Yea.\" Paddy says enthused by her words. \"Ok well I'll see ya.\" Sarah says before she hangs up the phone. She walks right back to her half empty cup of coffee and dumps the rest out in her sink. Tommy walks past Paddy on his way to the kitchen. Paddy sits cozy on his recliner rocking back and forth while watching some wrestling footage. Tommy can't make out if it's his or Brendan's but he won't bother. He doesn't care. Paddy takes this as an opportunity to talk to Tommy, preparing for the worst when it comes to him. Tommy is leaned on the counter, his back towards Paddy while chewing on a protein bar. Paddy walks in slowly his hands in his loose pant pockets. \"I just got off the phone with Sarah Ridge. You remember her right Tommy?\" Paddy asks, awaiting an answer. Of course it doesn't come. \"She, uh, lives a couple miles from here. Says she's gonna meet me for a cup of coffee tomorrow at noon at that diner you always went to if you wanna come.\" Tommy stops chewing. He turns around to face Paddy with a very confused expression. Paddy takes a deep breath, bracing himself. \"Why you meeting up with her for?\" Tommy asks with his elbow propping him up on the counter. \"Cuz Tommy it's been a while and I'd like to see how she's doing.\" Paddy answers, making sure to keep his voice low. \"She ya new best buddy or somethin'? Do me a favor old man, keep your plans to your damn self. I don't give a shit who you spend your sober moments with.\" Tommy says, deadly as ever. He passes Paddy and stomps his way up the stairs. Paddy stands, speechless and hurt yet again. The sizzling of hamburger grease fills the diner as Sarah sits comfy at a booth. She takes small sips of her coffee as her eyes set on the clock hanging on the wall. 12:03. He's late. She sighs and takes another sip. A couple more minutes and she's outta there. She looks away from the door, pondering why she even agreed to meet Paddy here. What does he hope will happen today? He can't hope she will forgive him just like that after all the times she tried to help him when nobody else was around and he didn't accept it. She hears the door open and instantly turns her head to see somebody other than Paddy in a grey sweat shirt and jeans walk in and take a seat across from her. Tommy. Her heart starts racing again. He just leans back chewing on a toothpick. He looks indifferent as usual. What's new? Sarah breaks the silence knowing he won't. \"What are you, um, doing here?\" she asks, nervously taking another sip of coffee. \"The old man told me he was meeting you here so I thought I would come instead. I mean I figured you had more to say to me right?\" he finishes with a smile but of course it's not genuine. An older waitress comes over. \"Hey Tommy you want some coffee?\" she asks with a pleasant smile on her face. \"Yes please thank you,\" Tommy says. For a split second, Sarah gets giddy. This is the positive Tommy she was used to being around. But it faded as soon as the waitress filled both cups and walked off. \"Look Tommy I'm sorry.\" Sarah says. \"I shouldn't have…I was trying to protect myself from getting hurt.\" Sarah says. There's not that long of a pause before Tommy comes back swinging. \"Protect yourself from getting hurt? Were you shipped off to Iraq know—\" Tommy gets cut off. \"That was your choice Tommy. You chose to enlist.\" Sarah says, slightly angry. \"I know that. But after talking to you that day, I went there knowing I would have no one here for me when I got back. That's a pain you will never understand.\" Tommy chews on his toothpick while leaned over on the table as much as he was when he was speaking to Paddy at this exact same spot. Anger flushed through his system. Sarah is staring down at her coffee unable to look Tommy in the eye after that. \"You have anything else you want to share?\" Tommy asks. Sarah shoots him a glare. \"Tommy you came here. I didn't go out there trying to find—wait did you say Paddy told you I was meeting him? I thought you hated h—\" \"He's training me that's it.\" Tommy says casually before taking a sip of his coffee. \"What are you training for? Sparta?\" Sarah asks. \"Yea.\" Tommy says. Sarah nods. Tommy looks up at her. \"Look Tommy, I've regretted leaving you. Not a day goes by that I don't think about how stupid I was.\" Sarah says. A tear falls and she angrily wipes it away, knowing Tommy won't wanna see it. \"Why?\" Tommy asks. Sarah cocks her head to the side, confused as ever. Tommy goes on. \"Why regret it? You knew what you were gonna say as soon as woke up that morning and got dressed and told me you loved me and held my hand all the way to the airport. You wasted all that goodbye then to see me sitting alive front of you now.\" Tommy chews harder on his toothpick using his hand to adjust it. Sarah purses her lips trying to stop herself from bursting into tears. \"I know. I was so scared of losing you that I…\" Sarah trails off, not being able to finish it.\"Decided to lose me.\" Tommy says. He digs in his pocket and pulls out a couple bucks, obviously signaling he's ready to go. He glances over at Sarah's coffee cup. \"Is that all you got?\" Tommy asks. Sarah looks over at him. \"Yea.\" She looks away again, not paying any mind on why he asked her. He tosses a couple bucks on the table. It's more money than needed for his cup and the tip. It's for her too. Tommy scoots out of the booth and begins walking when he stops and walks back. He stands next to Sarah who weakly looks up at him through her tears. He sighs. He knows he took it a little far but he's still angry about this. \"I'm sorry.\" He says before he walks out of the diner and out of sight. Paddy walks up to the diner door and sees Tommy walking down the street. Sarah exits and sees Paddy standing dumbfounded at the entrance. \"Sarah , what…?\" Paddy says as he puts two and two together from the tear stains on her face. \"I'm gonna go Paddy I'm sorry.\" Sarah walks off and hops into her car. Once again, Paddy gets the short end of the stick as he stands watching both people he cares for deeply disappear within minutes.[Chapter 5] \"HEY! Thank you so much for doing this Sarah!\" Tess says as she runs up to her and gives her a hug. Sarah stands in the middle of Tess Conlon's living room. Tess scurries around the room dressed up in a black dress with stockings and heels. \"It's no problem Tess really.\" Sarah says with a laugh as she sees how much of a nervous wreck Tess is. \"My mom couldn't make it and Brendan has to go to \"work\" and we really didn't have any one else.\" Tess says. \"Tess it's fine! I've babysat the girls before it will be fine.\" Sarah says. Tess stands after she grabs her keys and sweater. \"Ok well thank you so much. Let me get them down.\" Tess runs up the stairs leaving Sarah alone to wander the living room. She sees the most adorable pictures of Tess, Brendan, Emily and Rosie. You can tell they love their kids a lot. She turns her attention toward the back door that bursts open. Brendan shuffles in and lays his huge, black duffel bag at the entrance. He looks up and see Sarah standing with a smile in the middle of the room. Brendan closes the door and walks up to her with a \"haven't seen you in awhile\" face. \"Hey stranger,\" Brendan says as he opens his arms wide for a hug. \"Hey old man how ya doing?\" Sarah asks with a laugh as they embrace. \"Thank you so much for doing this,\" Brendan says. \"Stop. Seriously. You and Tess need to stop with the thanking and the appreciation really,\"Sarah says with a laugh. \"It's totally fine. I don't have work until later tonight so this all works out for you two.\" Sarah says. \"How's waitin' tables treating you?\" Brendan asks as he rummages through his pockets, obviously looking for something. \"I don't work there anymore. Got a new job.\" Sarah says, avoiding Brendan's eye contact. \"Where?\" Brendan asks. \"Colt's gym, you know, down in the burg.\" Sarah walks away and picks up another photo of Tess and Brendan on their wedding day. Brendan looks at her then down at his finger as he starts picking at his skin. \"So you've seen Tommy then? You heard he's back?\" Brendan asks. Sarah looks up at him, knowing there is no way she can possibly get out of this. She puts the photo down and stuffs her hands in her jacket pockets before letting out a deep breath. \"Yea. I did.\" Sarah says. Brendan nods slowly, understanding that she's already been hit by a little bit of his wrath. Brendan opens his mouth to start but Sarah stops him, knowing exactly where his question or response it going to lean towards. How are things between her and Tommy. \"Don't ask how we are cuz we're not anything. Nothing's changed and I'm sure he still hates me as much as he does you and Paddy.\" Sarah looks away just angry at the situation but then it hits her. That came off really wrong and Brendan didn't need to hear that. Especially after he told her Paddy came to see him a couple nights ago bitching about 1,000 days, etc. She turns back around to Brendan. \"I'm sorry Brendan. You know that's not what I meant.\" Sarah said, apologetic. \"Yea I know what you meant.\" Brendan says as he looks away, still rummaging through his pockets. He spots his keys on the kitchen table and grabs them. \"I'll catch you later.\" Brendan says as he walks towards the staircase. Sarah can tell that that comment she made affected more than she knows. \"I'm sorry I didn't—\" Sarah is cut off by Brendan's yells. \"Honey I'm leaving!\" Brendan yells. \"Alright babe see you.\" Tess yells. \"Bye daddy.\" \"Bye daddy.\" Emily and Rosie both say from upstairs. \"Bye girls. Love you.\" Brendan says as he gives Sarah one last look and walks out the door. Sarah quickly perks her mood up as the girls come running down the stairs and Tess smiles as she bolts out of the house. Sarah walks into Colt's gym not in such a good mood. She nods to Fenroy and heads towards the staircase. Colt is standing behind the ropes while yelling out commands to Mad Dog. Mad Dog doesn't spot her which she is completely ok with. Colt spots her. He doesn't look as angry as she thought he would've been. \"Hey just wait for me in the office. I have a lot for you to do. You know Sparta is coming up.\" Colt says to her. \"How could I forget? It's broadcasted on literally every channel.\" Sarah says through a laugh as she walks up the stairs. She walks slower mid way up the stairs realizing that she might run into Tommy today and emotionally, she just can't handle it. She spots him as soon as she reaches the top of the stairs. He doesn't see her though. He's leaned over on the phone. She sneaks into Colt's office which is right across from him. It's so quiet, she can almost hear a pin drop along with Tommy's mumbling. She tiptoes closer to the door to see if she can make out what Tommy's saying. \"You know, Pilar, I haven't forgotten what I promised you. What I promised Manny you know to take care of you guys. I've got opportunities coming up…\" Tommy says into the phone. Sarah spins around and searches on Colt's desk. She sees a paper labeled: Sparta Contenders. There is a long list of about 14 names obviously the first one being Koba. She searches wildly skimming over Mad Dog's then comes across a name she hoped she wouldn't see. Tommy Riordan. Riordan? Sarah turns around and sees Tommy hang up the phone. He walks back downstairs and passes Colt on the way down. Colt makes his way to the office. Sarah stands in front of him with the paper still in her hand. \"Why do you have Riordan as Tommy's last name on the Sparta paper?\" Sarah asks. \"That's the name he put down when he signed up.\" Colt says as he walks past her and goes to his desk. \"But that's not his last name.\" Sarah says, highly confused. \"Why is that your business? He asked to be in Sparta and he is. That's all that matters.\" Colt says. Sarah drops the paper on his desk and sits down, clearly knowing the night is going to be hell for her. Sarah pulls up to her apartment. The sky is bright with the appearance of the moon and stars. She climbs out of her car emotionally and mentally spent. She walks up to her house, eyes droopy. \"Hey,\" Tommy says as he stares up at her through tired eyes. It's clear he must've been sitting here for a while. Waiting. Sarah looks up. Surprise crosses her face as she stops a few feet away from Tommy who's sitting on her steps. \"You look pretty tired.\" Sarah says. It's the only thing that comes to mind as she stares into Tommy's eyes. \"Yea I've been sitting out here for a while.\" Tommy says as he rubs his hands together. \"So why have you been sitting out here for a while?\" Sarah says as she slowly inches closer to him. \"I just…I know I've been thinking a lot and I shouldn't have said what I said to you..\" Tommy turns his head and stares out into the empty road. \"No Tommy really.\" Sarah tries to stop him but he continues. \"I've been angry for so many reasons and I shouldn't have—\" Sarah interjects. \"No Tommy! Let me get this out. I was stupid. I would use the excuse that I was young but I wasn't. I was in love and I had my dad in my ear too much. He had his opinion about you, about your history, and about your decision to go into the marines and I listened. I wouldn't forgive me if I was you. \" Sarah says as she can't help the need to let out a nice cry. She holds it in for her and Tommy's sake. \"I didn't come here to forgive you Sarah.\" Tommy softly says as he stares at his hands. He stands up and walks closer to her. She has no idea what's happening but of course she doesn't look away or back up. He walks so close that their faces are inches away from each other. He puts a hand up to her cheek. His thumb moves up and down, gently caressing it. Her stomach explodes with butterflies. She's feeling so many emotions at once. She just stares at his face, looking at his blue-green eyes down to his nose then down to his lips. Oh my god his lips. She remembers loving to kiss his lips because as big as they are, they were always so gentle. \"Then what did you come here for?\" she asks, tempted to place her hand on his back but refuses. She decided she will let Tommy make all the moves since she's the one that screwed things up between them two. \"I came here to see if I would feel anything for you. I actually never thought I would see you again. I came here to see if I could look you in the eyes and know that I'm meant to be with you.\" They stare into each other's eyes. So deep into them they are almost hypnotized. Tommy leans forward and kisses her. She is so taken back by this but does NOT back away. The passionate kiss only last a few seconds before he pulls away, drops his hand, and backs up a couple feet. Sarah felt so many different things during that at once but one thing she was sure of was that she was still in love with this scarred man. Sarah opens her eyes in complete panic when he drops his hand, expecting the worst. Silence settles as Tommy stands in front of her, his hands in his jean pockets looking down at the ground. There are so many things she wants to say but she bites her lip. Finally, he speaks. \"I think I realized…\" he trails off and looks out into the empty road. Sarah looks at him, slowly getting impatient. Tommy looks back up at her then down at the ground again. It's like it's hurting him to say what he wants to say. Enough already. She power walks toward him, grabs his face hard, and kisses him. At first, she does all the work but after a few seconds he's passionately kissing her back. A car pulls up to the curb behind Sarah's car. This breaks Sarah and Tommy's focus as they turn to see Paddy's car. Paddy hops out of the car with a huge smile on his face. He obviously is a little overjoyed that his son looks slightly happy since he's been back for the first time in a long time.[Chapter 6] \"Whatchu smiling for? Why are you here?\" Tommy says while glaring at Paddy. Sarah steps a couple feet back. He's lost n his rage yet again and the kissing has officially ceased in his eyes. Paddy pulls off his worn off cap and steps closer to the two of them. \"I came here to see Sarah actually,\" Paddy says. Tommy looks at Sarah then back at Paddy. He shrugs his shoulders. \"Why?\" Tommy says, biting his lip. He's fuming. \"Just to talk to her Tommy. That's all.\" Paddy says, stopping in his tracks. Tommy nods. \"Alright. Well do your talking and get on home.\" Tommy stands straight up staring at Paddy with his hands tucked in his jean pockets again. \"Tommy.\" Sarah says as she stares at him. She knows he's always hated him but the sight of Paddy looking helpless is something she's seen enough of. She definitely doesn't want to see It now. \"What?\" Tommy asks, staring at her. Sarah knows its useless talking to him now. She looks over at Paddy. \"Paddy, maybe you should go.\" Sarah says as she stares at him. Paddy nods as he places his cap back on and drives off. Sarah walks closer to Tommy. He's a little scary right now but talking to him is worth the risk. \"Look I want this to work. But I'm not gonna be too happy if you're having the man that's training me over talking to you all the time. What do you two possibly talk about?\" Tommy says as he stares up at Sarah. He's slowly cooling off but Sarah watches her words anyways. \"You. I just don't want to lose you again. Like ever. If you don't want Paddy to come here anymore then I'll let him know.\" Sarah says. Tommy places his hand on her face again. Tommy kisses Sarah on the forehead. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" Tommy starts walking away when Sarah yanks his arm. She's panicking once again. She knows 5 years have gone by but he hasn't changed. \"Tommy, can you—\" Sarah is cut off by Tommy's soft words. \"I'm not mad at you.\" He stares into her eyes. She stares deeply into his eyes, surprised that he knew exactly what she was gonna ask. He walks back over to her and kisses her. This one is different. This one, to Sarah, feels like he needs her but not right now. It seems like the start of something and a goodbye all at once. He pulls away and walks off. Sarah stands in front of her house watching Tommy disappear into the night. She sighs and walks up to her front door, knowing she won't have long to lock herself up in her room and cry as the morning approaches faster than ever. Days turn into weeks as Tommy prepares for Sparta. Sarah always walks into Colt's gym to see Tommy in his black knit cap, sweaty as anything and Paddy in the ring watching him, studying him, and training him., The weirdest part for Sarah is that Tommy actually listens to Paddy. He's really taking this seriously. She can't help to laugh at the sight of Tommy and Mad Dog jumping rope across from each other and glare at each other. Obviously he's going to rip Mad Dog's throat. As Sarah walks up the stairs everyday and heads into Colt's office to handle paper work while Colt trains Mad Dog in the ring, a thought can't help but cross her mind: Why does Tommy want this so bad? I mean, she understands why Brendan is doing all these smoker fights, but why is Tommy doing this? Every time Tommy comes to see Sarah, she has the biggest urge to ask him but never works up the nerve to. He would never stay long either. She would be so close to him and yet he would feel so distant. \"Tommy I want to ask you something.\" Sarah says as they both lounge on her couch. Tommy stares at her with pressing eyes. She instantly gets nervous, thinking of changing her mind but she doesn't. \"Why are you competing in Sparta? I thought you said once your marine days were over fighting would be too.\" Sarah says. Tommy looks over at the wall. She couldn't tell if he was gonna explode r bite his lip off but she was getting pretty scared by his off reaction. \"It's something that I gotta do Sarah and that's all you need to know.\" Tommy says before getting up and exiting. Once again tears fall as she realizes she's finally got him back and she's crying more now than when they were apart. Brendan walks to his car out of breath and visibly sweating. He's been training hard. He throws his duffel bag in his back seat. He's about to hop in his car when he stops. \"Brendan! Wait!\" Sarah yells out as she approaches him. Brendan prepares himself for this. Sarah walks up slowly. Brendan, of course, sees her and is fuming just a little still for what he said to her. Seeing her face closer to him made his anger fade. She looks like hell. It looks like she's been crying 24 hrs straight, 7 days a week. \"Are you ok?\" Brendan asks. \"I'm fine look Brendan, I'm sorry for what I said. I shouldn't have said that, I don't know why I did.\" Sarah says. Brendan sighs. He can't help but for forget it happened. \"Alright I forgive you. How can I stay mad at you when you do such a good job with my girls.\" Brendan says with a smile, hoping it will lift her mood. \"You can't.\" Sarah says, trying her best to smile but she can't. 'Alright, Alright. Don't be too sure.\" Brendan says as he laughs. Sarah looks at him and then remembers something. \"You're going to Sparta?\" Sarah asks. Brendan's smile fades. \"How do you know that?\" Brendan asks. \"I your name…on the list…\" She trails off. Brendan sighs again. He knew she was gonna find out at some point. \"Sarah, I need the money. These smoker fights just aren't gonna cut it anymore.\" Brendan says. \"Yea Brendan but these guys are not some wanna be fighters. These are trained MMA fighters. Professional MMA fighters. What do you think is gonna happen? You're gonna walk in, throw a couple punches, and walk out?\" Sarah raises her voice slightly. She's pissed. \"Alright I already have Tess mad at me. I don't need this from you. This is something that I have to do.\" Brendan says. \"Yea I've heard that before.\" Sarah mumbles as she looks away. She considers telling Brendan about Tommy entering as well but sees someone running towards them or to Brendan. Brendan spots Frank jogging toward him. \"Can I go home now?\" Brendan says to Sarah, slightly fuming once again. Sarah turns around and walks off. Frank Campana walks up to Brendan, slightly winded from jogging. \"Hey forgot to tell you while you were flying out in a couple days. Tess coming?\" Frank asks. Brendan opens his car door and hops in. \"No.\" Frank nods and looks out into the parking lot and sees Sarah. \"Who's that?\" Frank asks. Brendan revs up his engine, ready to go. \"An old friend of Tess and I. See you in the morning.\" Brendan says as he smiles and drives off. Sarah wipes her face completely, making sure there's no tear residue. She knocks hard on Paddy's door. In less than 15 seconds, the door swing open. Paddy stands in front of Sarah looking pretty exhausted. He sees her and immediately opens the screen door. \"Sarah, what are you doing here?\" Paddy says, letting her in then shutting the door behind her. \"I need to see Tommy.\" She says. She takes a couple seconds to take in the room. She's taken back by all the photos on the wall. She's never seen these before. She's been here before but never seen all these photos. They are new. Maybe something he put up after he sobered up. She goes to the small end table and picks up one of Tommy and his mom. She remembers her. Loved her. She gets slightly teary eyed. She jumps when Paddy yells out up the stairs. \"Tommy Sarah's here!\" Paddy says as he walks to the kitchen. He doesn't look back at Sarah for some reason. Maybe knowing that if Tommy sees him talking to Sarah, he'll give him shit that he's already eaten by him before. Tommy walks down the stairs and searches the room with sleepy eyes until he spots Sarah. She quickly puts the picture down and turns to Tommy. \"What are you doing here? It's 3 in the morning.\" Tommy says. Sarah is speechless and feels like she's gonna cry again. Tommy can sense something is wrong. He extends his hand to her and she walks over to grab it. She follows him up the creeky staircase and to his bedroom, or the attic. He shuts the door behind him as he directs Sarah up the stairs and to his bed. Tommy sits down staring at her while she takes off her jacket and lays it on the other bed. She takes a seat right next to Tommy. She moves so close to him she's almost on top of him. He puts his arm around her and stares hard at her face. \"What's wrong?\" He asks. He's vulnerable. She doesn't know why and definitely doesn't question it. \"I've been crying all day because I feel so close to you physically whenever I'm around you and so distant with you up here.\" She puts her hand on the back of his head and rubs it, grips his hair alittle. Obviously feeling in the moment with their intimacy. \"Can you just talk to me and tell me what's going on up here?\" Sarah asks. She doesn't cry even though her voice sounds like she is already. Tommy places his hand on her cheek and stares at her lips. He then stares up at her eyes. \"I want you to come with me.\" He says, in almost a whisper. She looks at him confused. \"Come where?\" She asks. \"To Atlantic City. To Sparta. I want you there to support me.\" He says. She almost cries again but is way too tired to let another tear fall. She smiles and nods. She has no words but for her, this is one step closer to her feeling connected with him. She hugs him and he squeezes her so tight, his arms flex. She doesn't care. She just feels so protected in his arms. They release and he looks at her. She looks EXHAUSTED. \"I want you to sleep here tonight with me. In my arms.\" Tommy says. Sarah takes a deep breath and nods. The warmth from his hug made her even more sleepy then she already was. He gently pulls her to his chest and lies down. He rolls her over so her head is perfectly tucked between his chest and his arm. She falls asleep instantly with her left hand gently resting on his stomach. He makes sure he keeps his arm around her as he stares up at the ceiling, slowly dozing off to her soft snores.[Chapter 7] Excited chatter and several bodies fill the Boardwalk Empire as all the photographers and reporters try their best to get shots and interviews from the Sparta contenders. Sarah makes her way through the crowd with her arm in Tommy's. She's wearing a breathtaking short, black dress. She's never looked better but obviously she fancied up a little bit knowing there would be cameras here. Paddy leads the way smiling at all the photographers and reporters. Tommy looks at none of them. His only focus was making sure no one touched, talked, or breathed on Sarah. Tommy finds a cozy spot in the back and Sarah sits beside him. Paddy mumbles something to Tommy but it doesn't look like he cares. Paddy walks off and finds the tap out crew. Koba makes his way through the crowd with a huge smile on his face. He looks pretty snazzy and not terrifying in his suit. Non-stop flashes as everybody enters. Even Mad Dog with his stupid white Mohawk. Everybody seems so amped for this. Tommy barely says anything as the two of them sit there. Tommy takes a sip of his water and watches Paddy talk to the crew. He overhears something about sponsoring but Tommy doesn't care. He just wants to take home the prize money. Sarah is all smiles as she looks around at all the people pouring in from the outside. She doesn't pay much attention to Tommy as he stares off into the center of the room. She figures he's just glaring at someone so she scans the room, looking at all the faces. In less than 10 seconds, Tommy stands. \"Let's go.\" He whispers to Sarah. She looks up at him, surprised. \"Why? You're supposed to do the interview.\" Sarah says, very anxious by how shaken he is. \"Sarah can we go come on.\" Tommy says before he helps her up and walks toward the exit. She just stares at Tommy, trying to make sense of them coming all the way here to just leave. Paddy comes running up behind them calling out to Tommy. Sarah doesn't look back. She just keeps her hand in his and walks with him, passing several photographers who anxiously take pictures of them exiting. Tommy lies stiff in bed with one arm behind his head and one on his stomach. He's wearing an incredibly tight white beater. It looks like the exact same one he wore when he whooped Mad Dog's ass in Colt's gym but because Tommy is all beefed up and muscley, he looks like he was squeezed into in. He is staring up at the hotel bedroom ceiling. He looks like he's thinking but then again, you never know with him. A vibration comes from a cell phone on the night stand by the bed. Tommy turns to look at it then stares back up. The vibration comes again minutes later. Tommy moves over on the bed to glance at over at it. He doesn't pick the phone up because it's not his. He looks at the screen. It's a text. Brendan – Why didn't you tell me Tommy was in Sparta. You had to have known when you saw me if you saw my name on the list. Is that what you really came to tell me the other night? Tommy looks confused for a split second then catches on. Brendan's name was never brought up between the two of them. Anger flushes his calm face right out. He sits up on the bed. Sarah walks through the door and shuts it behind her. She looks pretty comfy in her baggy grey sweats and tight short sleeve shirt. Tommy glares at her. \"Ya phone went off.\" He gestures towards the night stand then stares blankly at the door. She walks quickly yet hesitantly toward the night stand and looks at her screen. Panic. She shoots a look up at Tommy who is staring at her, nose flaring. \"That's nice. You two are almost blood brothers. He has your number and you're meeting up with him?\" He asks but of course didn't mean to say it as a question. More like a statement because that's what he believes. \"Tommy…\" She lets out a deep breath and folds her arms. She looks like she's getting pretty tired of his damn random anger and mood swings. \"Say something to help me understand why the hell you talking to him for.\" Tommy says through gritted teeth. \"You know that I know Tess. I went to school with her and you know who she's married to.\" Sarah says. Tommy stands. \"I'm not stupid. Here's the thing. That name wasn't Tess that popped up on your screen.\" Tommy says, looking like he's about to lunge. The scariest part about this is that he's not raising his voice. It's that calm tone that made her stomach bulge up in knots. She's about to answer him when Paddy comes bursting through the door. \"Come on. You gotta see this.\" Paddy says as he anxiously jogs back out. Tommy bites his lip as he slowly walks towards the entrance of the bedroom. Sarah slowly creeps up too and the first words she hears is: Water was coming in from everywhere. She's so confused. Her first thoughts were a little negative like maybe Tommy has driven Paddy back to the bottle again and he's going loopy but Tommy's face tells it all. He's stiff. He stares at the T.V. and nothing else. Sarah slowly walks closer to Tommy and stands right beside him, fitting perfectly in the gap between Tommy's arm and the wall. She sees a man on the T.V.: Mark Bradford. He's wearing a uniform. Marines. She looks at Tommy. He's just emotionless as he stares at this familiar face. \"..the back ramp gets ripped off and there he was.\" Bradford says, looking into the camera as if he was looking at Tommy himself. Tommy's face gets hard and he goes back in the room. A light switch flicks on in Sarah's head. Tommy saved that marine. Well then Tommy should be proud right? She wasn't understanding his reaction as she walked up to him grabbing a long sleeve shirt from the back of the edge of the bed. \"Tommy you did that? You saved that man?\" Sarah had a light in her eyes but the look Tommy gave her knocked the light right out. He walked past her, shirt in hand and heading for the door. She grabs the shirt and tugs it, trying to stop him from shutting her out. Again. \"Tommy you told me you were gonna try to let me in. Please don't walk out.\" Sarah pleads as she walks closer to him, their bodies touching. He looks at her, clenching his jaw. A few seconds go by when Sarah realizes what Tommy's eyes are trying to tell her: LET ME GO. Weakly, her hand slides off the shirt and swings back to her side. She shakes her head realizing the monster she created by leaving him those years ago. She follows him into the main room. \"Tommy, did you—where you going?\" Paddy asks. \"Taking a walk.\" Tommy says before leaving the room and slamming the door behind him. Paddy shouts his name and turns to Sarah. She shrugs her shoulders, knowing he's an impossible force. They both turn back to the T.V. screen and stare at Bradford. \"Thank you. You saved my life brother. Anyone seeing this at Sparta, anybody out in Pittsburgh, you reach out to Tommy Riordan and tell him Mark said thank you.\" He says. Sarah slips onto the couch. She's speechless. The man she loves. A bigger hero than a villain. \"Footage taken from the helmet cam on the ground in Iraq captured the heroic incident.\" The news reporter says. The phone rings. Sarah zones out to any other sound but the shouts coming from the T.V. She sees Tommy swim into the sunken tank and her heart stops. She shuts her eyes. Yes he's a hero but it looks like they're at war. She knows they're at war but this is the reason she broke up with him. She had nightmares of him being shot at or dying from an explosion every night leading up to that day at the airport. It was very different actually seeing real footage of him out there doing his job. She didn't know what to feel. She was feeling more in love and more hurt. Scared then terrified. Hating herself to loving him again. Wanting to just hold him and say how proud she was of him. But then wanting to close the door in his face because he won't open up to her when he said he would try to. All these feeling fade in the matter of minutes. She doesn't know the whole story. 5 years is a long time. Maybe something deeper happened. Any marine would feel proud but Tommy's not. She picks up the remote and turns the T.V. off. Paddy sets down the phone and whips his head around at Sarah. \"Did you know that?\" Paddy asks. HE slides down on the sofa too. He's bewildered and shocked all at once. Sarah shakes her head staring blankly at the black screen. \"I found out when you did.\" She looks up at him. \"Who called?\" Sarah asks pointing to the phone. \"That was Brendan.\" He says while rubbing his head. \"Brendan?\" Sarah asks. She's so confused. What did Paddy do? Give Brendan the room number? Paddy can see she's thinking of how to word the most obvious question. \"Don't ask.\" Paddy says as he smirks and walks to his bedroom. Sarah folds her arms and leans back on the sofa. She's thinking really hard and Paddy can almost hear her. He spins around. \"He'll be fine Sarah. He's a big guy. Don't wait up for him cuz odds are he'll show up 5 minutes after his match tomorrow.\" He says as he walks in his room and closes the door. 10 minutes. 25 minutes. 30 minutes. Sarah sits on the couch, in the same seat and still pondering. Wondering what he's doing right now. Wondering why Brendan called the room. Wondering why she's still sitting here. She walks to the room, grabs her jacket and slips on flats. She's calm but curious. She heads to the room door and pulls it open to see a tall, man with his hand raised like he was about to knock. She can't make out his face until she inches a little closer. She can't seem to understand why Mad Dog is standing in front of her with a smile on his face…[Chapter 8] \"So I think me and you have some unfinished business.\" Mad Dog says as a smug smile forms on his lips. \"Do we really? What kind of business would me and you have that is so important you took the risk of coming to this room?\" Sarah says with an edge of anger in her voice. \"The risk? What should I be afraid of? Your boyfriend? Is he here?\" Mad Dog peaks his head over hers and tries to look around the room but sees an empty room. \"Look go back to your room, go to sleep and tomorrow can pound his face in if he lets you.\" Sarah tries to close the door but Mad Dog slams his hand on it, stopping it. \"I'm not finished here.\" He says as he takes a couple steps inside. Sarah backs up, knowing what's about to happen. \"So are you gonna do huh? Hit me again?! Hit me! Come on!\" Sarah screams while nose to nose with him. He stares at her still smiling but doing nothing. \"You should be thanking me instead of trying to intimidate me. You think if I told Colt the real reason I left you he would still be training you let alone have you step foot on his property? God only knows what he would do to you.\" Sarah says. Mad Dog scoffs. Nobody told you not to tell him that I put my hand on you anytime you lost your place.\" He backs her up into a corner of the room, hovering over her. Paddy lies on his bed with his headphones on still flipping through the men of Sparta book. He can't hear a thing except for what he's listening to. Tommy walks down the hotel hallway hands in his jean pockets. A little bit of sand flies off Tommy's shoes as he walks toward the hotel room. He sees the door is almost wide open. He walks in cautiously and sees Mad Dog standing over Sarah as she's trying her best to push him off. He has her pinned against the wall as he laughs, feeling in complete control. Tommy quickly but quietly reacts and walks behind Mad Dog. In less than a few seconds, Tommy has his arms around Mad Dog's neck in a brutal, tight choke hold. Mad Dog's face turns colors as he flails his arms, clawing at Tommy's grip, trying to get free. Tommy positions his lips right by Mad Dog's ear so he can hear him clearly. He says these words soft but his eyes are deadly. Sarah is completely terrified. She is obviously shaken up from Mad Dog and right now. \"You come around her again, I'll break your neck. I'm gonna give you a free pass tonight because I wanna kick your ass in the ring.\" Tommy backs up with Mad Dog and tosses him out of the room and into the hallway. Tommy stands at the entrance of the room waiting to see What he's gonna do when he stands up. Mad Dog rubs his neck and backs away. Tommy nods and bites his lip knowing the little intimidating Mad Dog has left won't do shit to him. \"You've made a mistake Rock.\" He says before he walks down the hallway. Tommy closes the door and takes a deep breath, trying to release all the anger in that breath. Sarah has her hands cupped over her face, sobbing quietly to herself. Tommy turns and walks toward her. \"What did he do to you?\" he asks. She doesn't look up at him. He rubs her arms gently, hoping she will know that he's calmed down and is here for her now. \"What did he do to you Sarah?\" he asks again. \"Nothing.\" She says, wearily. Tommy looks at her knowing she's lying. \"I'm not going to do anything to him until the tournament ok? Now tell me the truth. What did he do to you just now?\" He asks. \"He didn't do anything to me right now…\" She trails off and looks away. \"He takes another deep breath. He's hoping she doesn't mean what he thinks she means. \"I know the two of you had a thing before and I don't really care about it but umm…\" Tommy looks at her, hard. \"Why did you leave him?\" Sarah looks at him. \"Tommy it was a long time ago. I don't remember.\" Tommy looks heated. \"No no no no don't play stupid with me. Why?\" Sarah drops her arms away from her face, knowing she's about to give in. \"He , uh, used to…\" She shuts her eyes and turns away from him. \"Sarah.\" Tommy says, knowing she is so close to cracking. \"Hit me.\" She starts crying and leans into Tommy's broad chest. He wraps his arms around her and leans his head on hers. The rage sets fire into Tommy's eyes as he bites his lip trying his best to not break open the door and rip that mohawked fool to shreds. \"You don't want walk out music?\" Sarah asks as she grabs Tommy's hoodie off a chair. \"No.\" Tommy shakes his head as he grabs it from her and slips it on. \"You know what would be funny?\" Sarah asks. \"What's that?\" Tommy asks. \"Playing that theme song from Rocky.\" Sarah says with a laugh. Tommy rolls his eyes playfully. He grabs her face and kisses her. Sarah instantly becomes weak and passionately shares the kiss with him. \"Paddy you're up.\" An official says as he pokes his head in then pokes it out and leaves. \"Alright Tommy let's go.\" Paddy says as he heads for the door. \"I'll go snag that front row.\" Sarah says before turning around and walking towards the door. She turns back around and smiles. \"Good luck Tommy.\" She says before exiting. Tommy looks at the door and nods, knowing he can do this. He walks out into the hallway and passes a room. He glances at it and through the small window opening he can see Brendan staring at him while jumping rope. The look they give each other is different. Maybe a little spark of support but Tommy turns his head back around and heads towards Paddy and the camera men before entering the arena.[Chapter 9] Tommy hops into the ring after dealing with the chaos that is the Sparta arena. He's in his own zone and is not paying attention to his surroundings. Paddy walks past Sarah who stands anxiously and impatiently in the first row. He scampers over to Tommy's corner and takes in the energy coming from the crowd. There's females with signs in their hands for Tommy. Men are chanting his name and everyone else is cheering as they wait for the round to begin. The lights dim as the arena prepares for the second fighter to make their entrance. Sarah pays no mind to who it is. All she can focus on is Tommy. He's jumping in the corner clearly pumping him up for an easy victory. Her palms slowly start to sweat and her heart slowly begins to accelerate. She's said it before and she'll say it again: She's NEVER liked watching him fight but she knows she has to be there to support him. Her eyes follow his every move including him adjusting his mouth guard and crouching in and out of his ready position. She allows her eyes to scan his entire body starting from his lips and making their way down to his bulging arms and his cut stomach. She gets a little turned on by her initial thought of her grabbing him by his sweaty, tussled hair and kissing him intimately while using her free hand to grip his plump breasts. The last time they made love was exactly 5 years ago. The same morning he went away. Since then, she's only been with one other man and it was Mad Dog. Of course they shared countless nights of rough sex but it was all fun for her, never intimate like those long nights she shared with Tommy. She snapped out of these explicit thoughts as she watched the second fighter hop confidently and angrily into the ring. Now her mind was racing and she easily wanted to run and not watch this fight but she knew Tommy could take him. She crossed her fingers anyways. The ref calls them both to the center. In the blink of an eye, the ref shouts, \"Let's go to war!\" Sarah watches intently while biting her nails. Literally. She's nibbling on them so card, her skin stings from the irritation. She blinks for what seems like a millisecond and the other fighter is on the ground, rubbing his eyes. She instantly throws her arms up and cheers. She screams Tommy's name and whistles. The worst is over and now she can enjoy the victory. It happened pretty fast but that's good enough for her. She watches him storm out of the cage and doesn't even think anything of it. Paddy shoots her a worried glance from the sidelines and she shrugs at him. She won't question it. At this point, she would rather keep all her questions to herself then ask him while he's at a vulnerable state and risk losing him again. Sarah returns later that night with Paddy to watch Tommy brutally dominate his first round with Diego Santana. She watches with an ounce of horror and a shred of sadness while wincing at every punch Tommy throws at the fighter. He's lost in his rage and she can't help but look at him from time to time and not be able to recognize him. God bless Mad Dog is all she chants in her head as she exited the arena in a beeline for Tommy. Paddy stayed behind to take in the complete and utter gratification the crowd was giving Tommy even though they all knew he left the arena. He looked out at the hundreds of strangers that screamed out his son's name and turned to look over at the bruised and battered fighter helplessly on the ground surrounded by Josh and the medical team. The volume from the crowd seemed to soften and become almost background music to Paddy's creeping thoughts as he began laughing at all that was happening. Thinking of Tommy put a proud gleam in his eye as he had the slight tug of hope in his heart that he and his son's might rekindle the relationship they used to have and the relationship that could possibly come out of Sparta.[Chapter 10] Sarah shook her head as she followed behind Tommy into their hotel room and to their bedroom. Paddy was nowhere in sight and neither of them paid any mind to his absence. Tommy pulled his sweatshirt off and tossed it on the bed. You could cut the tension in the room with a knife and of course, Sarah tried. She slowly walked over to the bed and sat on the edge. She stared up at Tommy feeling helpless yet responsible for the man standing in front of her. He ruffled through his duffel bag that was propped up on the bed and paid no mind to Sarah's pleading eyes as he searched for a clean shirt. She bit her lip and looked down at her fingers. She lightly began picking at her nails, knowing this is the only entertainment she'd get for the night. The constant sound of Tommy's fingers scraping against the fabric of the bag broke Sarah out of her temporary fidgeting to stare up at him again. She gently touched his forearm and began rubbing it. The sweat that glistened on his olive skin was gone and she began smiling as the smoothness of his skin brought back so many good memories they shared. Tommy stopped rummaging through the bag and placed his arms by his side. Sarah's hand slipped slowly from his arm and she stared into his blue and green eyes once again. He looked at her as if he was going to shed a tear from the guilt that was slowly making its way to his head. For some odd reason, he thought what he was doing was fair. Payback even. Storming angrily out of the cage after his fights and saying not a word to her as he walked to the back room to lay down. As tough as he felt, he could never look at her because he knew he would break. Yes. She apologized and made it clear how much she regretted her decision and that was enough for him. He just couldn't get over her choice of character: Mad Dog Grimes. The thought of him fueled the fire in him again and he closed his eyes as he took another deep breath. Sarah stood up and inched closer to him. She raised her pointer finger and traced each one of his abs on his extremely toned stomach. Tommy opened his eyes with caution as he looked down at her. She didn't look up at him. She stayed focused on her finger as she made her way down to the last two squares on his body. She then raised her other arm and laid it gently on his bicep, leaving little space between their bodies as she took another step forward. He placed both of his sore, beat up hands on her face and lightly tilted her head up. She gazed into his eyes but felt no need to lunge toward his lips to kiss him. She knew by the way he was looking at her right now he was hesitating to go that extra step. He opened his mouth to speak as she wrapped her arms around his waist. \"I'm gonna go shower then go to the slots. You can come if you want. I could use some company while I try to clear my head.\" He said. She slowly nodded as she looked down at his broad chest. She kissed him gently between both of his breasts. She wasn't trying to seduce him. She knew nothing was going to happen tonight. She just loved him with all of her heart and just wished she could go back in time to at least 5 years ago and undo what she did. She looked back up at his smoldering eyes. He was studying her every movement and expression and she didn't care. \"Are you sure you want me to go with you because if you want to clear your head, you can go alone.\" She said as she loosened her weak grip around him. Her eyes trailed off, focusing on his tattoo lying beautifully on his right breast. He pulled her face up again to meet his. \"Yes I'm sure alright?\" he said, clearly waiting for a response. Sarah nodded again and let her arms fall completely away from his body. She wasn't satisfied. Yes he said the words but you can say something and not mean it. Pity is what she believes he feels towards her and she knew she wasn't going to dare try and express her feelings about this now. He stared at her for a minute before he pulled jeans, briefs, and a blue, long sleeve shirt from his bag and marched towards the door. In her head she had hoped that maybe he would give her a lustful stare so they could enjoy that hot, steamy shower he was about to take together but he gave her no more eye contact than he already had. He walked out of the room and closed the door behind him. Sarah plopped down on the bed as one simple question kept popping into her head every few seconds. Where's Paddy?...[Chapter 11] \"How do you feel Brendan huh?! Beat two of the dirtiest fighters in this tournament. Good job brotha.\" Frank Campana said he followed behind Brendan on their way back to the Resorts hotel. \"It feels great man It feels great.\" He said enthusiastically as he turned to face Frank. Frank had a wide smile almost permanently planted on his face. \"Oh look who's all gung ho for Brendan now.\" Brendan said playfully, waiting for Frank to pick up on his sarcasm. \"Look look I know what you're trying to say but I never underestimated you man.\" He said while slapping his hand down on Brendan's shoulder. Brendan snapped his head towards him and glared. Liar. \"Ok ok maybe a little.\" Frank said. Brendan is unconvinced. . He stopped walking and turned to fully face Frank, arms folded. Frank threw his hands up in defense like the police just told him to put his hands up. \"Alright what do you want? Blood?\" Frank asked, not allowing Brendan's little \"I told you so\" parade to ruin his high. \"Maybe.\" Brendan smirked and continued walking toward the door to the lobby. \"Ok I underestimated you more than a little but you've proved me wrong brotha. Two more fights and you're bringing home the money.\" Frank said as he jogged to be the first one to the door. He swung it open and swung his other arm up and through the door, gesturing for Brendan to be the first one. \"After you Brendan oh great one.\" Frank said through his laugh. Brendan shook his head and smiled. There was something wrong with this guy. He knew it. \"Alright alright knock it off.\" Brendan said as he scooted past Frank and walked into the lobby. They both walked over to the elevator laughing until Brendan heard a familiar voice call out behind him. \"Brendan hey Brendan.\" Paddy said as he raced up to him, anxious as anything. Brendan and Frank both stopped in their tracks and turned to face his father. Paddy was trying his best keep his smile so Brendan could see that he was genuinely happy to see him but it didn't look like he was buying it. Brendan sighed Brendan sighed and turned to Frank. \"Hey I'll see you up there.\" He said. Frank got the hint quickly and nodded. He gave them both one last look before he headed toward the elevator. Brendan turned towards Paddy. \"Brendan that was impressive what you did out there.\" Paddy said. \"Thanks pop. What do you want?\" Brendan said, finishing with folded arms and pursed lips. Paddy's weak smile faded. \"I can't just tell my son he did an amazing job?\" he asked. \"Yea sure if his name is Tommy.\" Brendan said. He looked Paddy up and down. \"What did you think? Your congratulations was gonna get you a hug and a kiss. I'll see ya.\" Brendan walked toward the elevator and didn't look back at Paddy as he entered. Paddy stared stunned at the elevator but not surprised. What he said now was no different than the what he said a few weeks ago. Sarah and Tommy sit awkwardly beside each other in the casino. Sarah isn't playing a slot machine but is sitting in front of one while watching Tommy reach inside his huge cup full of quarters and toss a few in the machine right before pulling the lever. He obviously isn't really playing to win. He's not creating any strategic plan like most do when they want to win some extra cash. It almost looked like he was in some weird daze. He never blinked once as he continued to grab quarters and pull the lever. Sarah let out a huge sigh that Tommy pretended not to hear. What was the point of saying he wanted her to go with him if he was going to act like he was by himself anyways? She sat up in the highly uncomfortable chair, looking as if an idea popped into her head. \"What's that from?\" she asked, staring at a tiny scar on his left eye brow that made a noticeable division between the hair. \"What?\" he asked. Sarah leaned and swiped her thumb over the small slit on his eyebrow. She put her arm down and waited for his response. He looked at her then at someone past her. Tommy's eyes instantly turned away from that direction and focused blankly on the slot machine. Sarah turned around to see what caused the instant shift in the mood and once again she knew why. Paddy stood behind her, eyes completely focused on Tommy. \"Can't sleep huh?\" Paddy asked, eyes still transfixed on his son. Paddy lightly rubbed Sarah before snagging the chair on Tommy's opposite side. Sarah looks at Tommy, who was now rubbing a quarter in his hand, and thought maybe she ought to go upstairs and call it a night. She probably shouldn't be here for this conversation or maybe a loud argument that was gonna come outta this. She leaned closer to Tommy once again and gently laid her arm his forearm. \"I'm gonna go.\" Sarah whispered to him. Tommy shot a look to her hand then up at her eyes. \"Why?\" he asked, complete confusion in his tone which made Sarah question her own comment a few seconds ago. She didn't have much time to think about her answer before Paddy chimed in. \"I know that other thing is bothering the hell out of you. I'm proud of you Tommy.\" Paddy said with a proud, sparkling gleam in his eye. Sarah leaned back in her chair and used the slot machine in front of her to spin herself around to face it. This isn't her fight so she shouldn't be listening to this one. While she heard low murmurs of Paddy and Tommy's voice, she divulged into her own weeping thoughts. Her mind never stopped going back to her and Tommy. What happened before and what's happening now. She thought she showed him enough now to make him understand that she wanted him now. She stated how immature she was and how stupid she was for losing him then. What else did he want? Blood? Her thoughts shifted as she turned toward Tommy to hear the last words of his sentence: \"..beggar with your cup out. Take it somewhere else man, you know what here's a cup…\" Tommy said as he reached for his quarter cup and began viciously throwing quarters into it while Paddy mumbled for Tommy to stop. This was exactly why she thought she should go upstairs and call it a night. \"GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE.\" Sarah watched in horror as that full cup of quarters was thrown into Paddy's face. Even the cup. Her jaw almost hit the ground as she looked over at Paddy. He always moped with a puppy dog face but the one planted on his face now clearly amounted from something more. He looked up from Tommy to Sarah's eyes. She was almost on the edge of crying and wound up dipping her head down to break the eye contact. Paddy stood up and dragged his limp body away from them and Tommy wound up turning around to watch him walk away too. A quarter that bounced off Tommy's slot machine rolled past Sarah's foot and she looked from that up to Tommy. Her tears finally made an appearance trickling slowly down her face and that triggered Tommy's rage once again as he looked at her. \"What are you crying for? You feel bad for that sack of shit? Well why don't you join him since both of your asses are too late.\" Tommy said with complete disgust in his voice. Sarah shook her head and began quietly sobbing as she stood up and walked slowly toward the elevator. She felt as weak as Paddy right now and her tears rolled off her face and bounced off what looked like a Persian carpet. Fancy casino. As she was exactly two inches away from the elevator and the doors opened, she felt someone tug at her arm. It shocked her out of her extremely loud head and as she spun around, she saw the person she knew she needed right now. Tommy. They backed into the elevator and watched the door close. Not that it mattered since the doors were glass and anything that was going to happen here would be seen regardless. Tommy's face surprised Sarah in the fact that he looked brokenhearted. Like someone just stomped on his heart. Hard. He sniffed which gave Sarah the impression that maybe he'd been crying, she wasn't sure. He pulled her body closer to his as he smashed his lips onto hers. The passion filled the small elevator as Sarah felt like putty in his hands, moldable to his very need. She pulled apart from him then backed away. She was so angry at him and now he just came to her pouring his heart into her hands. He looked at her and nodded while sucking his lips in. He understood why she would want to pull away from him. He comforted her to then turn around and leave her in the dark. While he was in mid thought, Sarah walked over to the elevator buttons and pushed up. She then walked strongly up to Tommy, with tears still streaming down, grabbed his face with both her hands and kissed him. After they shared one long, lustful kiss, she moved her lips over to the exposed skin on his neck. She softly grazed her teeth over it like a mountain lion ready to take a bite out of its dinner. She wrapped her lips perfectly around the entire patch of skin and kissed it. She heard his heart race a little faster than normal until she moved her lips up his neck and to his jaw bone. He softly whimpered and moved her face away from his neck before grabbing hers and softly tracing her rosy pink lips with his thumb. She couldn't control her breathing as she concentrated on how focused his eyes were on her lips. She was gently gripping his blue shirt, tugging at it, clearly wanting it off. After what seemed like forever, Tommy hungrily kissed Sarah, opening the floodgates and steering them into a passion of no return.[Chapter 12] Their bodies burst thought their hotel bedroom door and Tommy slammed it behind them. Sarah leaped into Tommy's arms and used his trap muscles to keep her balanced as she wrapped her legs around his waist. Tommy wasn't caught off guard and cupped his hands firmly around her bottom while feeding his wild addiction for her lips. As they moved closer toward the bed, Sarah broke away from his full, soft lips and began sucking on his neck in every angle and every way. They were panting heavily as if they'd just finished a 10 mile run and were going for the home stretch. They plopped backward onto the bed with Sarah still clinging onto Tommy for dear life. She felt Tommy's slowly growing erection between her legs and the thought of them making love raged her hormones faster than before. With her right hand wrapped tightly around Tommy's head, she used her other hand to slip underneath his shirt and rub his pecs. She rubbed her way up to his shoulders as his tongue hydrated every inch of her mouth. After a few minutes of this, she freed her hand from his head and helped him pull his shirt off. He kneeled up, forcing her to legs to release their grip on his waist, exposing his amazingly toned physique. Her breathing accelerated as she looked at his perfect body, the body she could lick over and over again until her tongue dried out. She wasted no time as she pulled off her grey tank top off and tossed near the nightstand. She tugged at the top of his pants and began slowly rubbing his bulge from the outside of his jeans. He crawled over top of her again and kissed her sanguine colored lips before using his tongue to trail down her neck to her stomach and to the top of her jeans. He unbuttoned her worn out route 66 jeans and slowly unzippered them, sliding them off along with her thin, laced underwear. She moaned as she felt the fabric of her underwear slide past her curves and off her body. Her eyes stayed closed as her arms searched for his biceps. Before his lips made it to her opening, she sat up to pull his face up toward hers to once again, take full advantage of his pillow, soft lips. She moaned every time their lips parted to then meet again and every second to her felt like an orgasm. His lips parted with hers again and he rubbed them against her neck. He sucked and bit her there as his fingers found their way to the band of her bra. He unhooked it in less than 2 seconds and Sarah threw it to the ground and lay down again to then securely wrap her bare legs around Tommy's waist. Her hand slid down his toned chest and onto his jean zipper. She used both hands to slide his jeans down slightly, enough to introduce his erection. She wrapped her hand around his fleshed, pulsating organ and Tommy let out a breath as she now took over the dominant role. She adjusted herself so she could suck on his neck while slowly but firmly stroking his cock. He bit his lips and squeezed his eyes shut, trying to find the words to tell her to stop. It was like he was crumbling into a million pieces as she continued to breath her warm breath onto his neck and lick up all the small trickles of sweat that began to roll down. He never remembered her being this lustful but he was in no position to complain. Her lips shook on his neck as the fast racing strum of his heart beat jolted through his entire body. She never sped up while stroking his organ, keeping the rhythm steady and sensual. She enjoyed hearing his short breaths but didn't want him to come this way. She released her grip on his hard-on and he took complete advantage of that as his head quickly sped down toward her warmth. Without hesitation, he opened her legs wide open and his lips instantly went to her inner thigh and he began softly licking the trail leading to her center. He swept his mouth over her apex, teasingly entering her with his tongue then pulling out every few seconds. Whenever she tried to lean up to grip his hair or caress his biceps, he pushed her down, wanting full control of this moment. She could feel her nectar ooze out of her and Tommy's tongue wasn't far behind. He sucked up everything he laid eyes on and soon the room flooded with the sound of her moans. He sucked her clit slowly then sped up to then slow down again and this made Sarah's body twitch uncontrollably. She managed to whimper out his name, a sheer warning that she was very close to her orgasm. He stopped and pulled his jeans and underwear off completely before towering over her again, crushing his lips onto hers. Her hand instantly motioned toward his cock and she maneuvered it toward her entrance before Tommy's hand was guiding it there too. He trembled slightly as his mushroom tip slowly burst through her entrance and he paused for a second. Sarah didn't try to figure out why. She wrapped her arms around his neck and pushed herself down further until his full length was securely inside her. Sarah was hanging off his body as Tommy slowly pushed in and out of her. A low moan escaped from him as she tightened her legs around him. He licked her neck and she sped up the pace, pouncing on his firm flesh. He used his arm to grip the back of her neck, taking control once again. He went back to fucking her slowly as he sucked on her nipple and took a bite out of her neck. He kissed her softly and her moans escaped through her nose as she scratched his back, completely lost in desire. She lost all control as one last stroke made her come. Although she was coming down from her high, she began to pound harder on his cock until the strong arm that was holding them up gave out and he came. She lifted his face to stare into his eyes and kissed him. Their breathing became in sync as Tommy teasingly kissed her lips, forehead and eyelids. He didn't pull out of her as he caressed her face, feeling one with her. She felt so alive in this moment with him. She loved taking the dominant role with him because it was new. He's never been this shaken before so she knew this was as different for him as it was for her. \"I love you.\" He said, swimming deep into her hazel eyes. They sparkled as she took in the moment. She could tell he meant them and would never take them away. She brought her fingers up to his lips and traced the perfect shape of them. \"I love you too Tommy.\" She said. Sarah took advantage of his weak state and rolled over, lying comfortably on top of him. She twirled her fingers in his hair and hungrily kissed him. He tightened his arms around her and prepared for the next ride he knew was coming. She slowly rocked back and forth on his slow growing erection until it was up in full force again. She moaned quietly at first as his cock slid in and out of her. She sat up and began bouncing up and down on it, using his thighs to help keep a steady pace. He slid his hands down to her hips and moved her up and down, trying to take control again. Her moans got louder, bouncing off the empty hotel room walls as Tommy's hands shifted from her hips to her breasts, cupping them at first then pinching her nipples gently. Her eyes rolled in the back of her head and she collapsed onto Tommy, moaning louder as she kissed him passionately. She rocked him faster, her breathing increasing. Tommy fisted her hair and moved her head so his lips could touch the gentle spot on her neck. He sucked her there until he heard her whimper his name again, another indication that she was very close to coming. His hands shot to her hips and he stopped her rocking and lifted her so he could pull out then slowly push back in. Her moans grew and she wrapped her arms around his neck and sucked on it. It took everything in her not to slide his hands off so she could fill herself with him again, her entrance feeling like a pit of flames and only he could put it out. He did this a few times before she came, the amazing warm feeling rising through her entire body. Tommy moaned before one last pound made him explode inside her. They panted heavily as they were slowly coming down from their high. Tommy pulled her face up to his and noticed how exhausted she looked as her eyes closed for a few seconds than popped back open every time she blinked. He smirked quietly to himself and pulled out of her, placing her gently beside him. He slid the thin bed sheet over her as he watched her peacefully nod off. He smiled before getting up off the bed and slipping his jeans on. He quietly dug through his bag and pulled out a grey t shirt and a pair of baggy black shorts. Twisting the knob ever so slowly, Tommy crept through the door and cracked it behind him. He walked up to the bathroom door and stopped when he glanced over at Paddy's door. He debated whether or not he should see if he's there but quickly changed his mind. He opened the bathroom door knowing that, even though he hadn't forgiven Paddy, he had forgiven someone who he knew today, would stick with him through anything.[Chapter 13] Sarah's eyes slowly fluttered open as she lied awake in the dark hotel bedroom. There was a small peek of light shining through the window and it landed beautifully on Tommy's face. He was turned towards her, cozy and sound asleep. She smiled and lifted her hand to gently rub his face. He didn't even stir as she traced all along his cheek. She lowered her hand, sat up, and froze. The lower part of her body was throbbing as she lifted the thin bed sheet to cover her breasts. She knew this would happen. She hadn't had sex in two and a half years and she did ram Tommy into herself without easing it in first. She slid on her pants and shirt and quietly dug through a drawer by the nightstand, looking for something clean so she could shower up. She grabbed whatever she could find, casual shirt and baggy pants, and headed toward the door. She tiptoed toward the bathroom door and stopped to stare at Paddy's. This time, she would be the one to check on him. She walked over to the door and cracked it ever so slightly to see that the bed was empty. She looked at the clock hanging in the main room to see that it was 2:45 in the morning. A wave of worry shot through her and she closed the door and walked to the bathroom, praying that wherever Paddy was, he was ok. She walked quietly out of the bathroom and crept back into the bedroom. She placed her jeans and top on a nearby chair and crawled back into bed, trying her hardest not to wake Tommy as she moved around trying to get into a comfortable position. As soon as her head hit the pillow, Tommy's eyes snapped open. Sarah smiled and brought her hand to his cheek again. She adjusted herself to move closer, wincing in pain as she did so. He noticed her expressions and squinted at her. \"What's wrong?\" he asked as his hand caressed her cheek. \"I'm just sore.\" She said, finishing with an embarrassing smile. His strained face didn't change as his fingers trailed down her cheek and toward her neck. He moved her face to the side so he could take a glimpse at both sides of her neck; the places where he knew he'd taken some pretty big chunks out of in the heat of the moment. In the faint light, he could see faded dark purple marks along with some red spots. She felt the mood change and she quickly pushed his hand down. \"I'm fine. That's not what hurts.\" She said while meshing her and Tommy's fingers together. He looked as though he was going to begin a very mopy apology when Sarah cut him off. That's stupid. It's the best sex she's ever had and there was no way she was going to let him feel bad for her sore vagina. This was not going to become a Bella and Edward moment after their honeymoon sex. \"Stop.\" She said as she leaned into his plump, rosy pink lips. They passionately kissed as if it was their first time, knowing where this was going to lead again. Sarah took the initiative to lean up on her elbow and straddle Tommy. She twisted her fingers in his hair while sliding her other hand down past his stomach and under his shorts. Tommy released one hand he'd placed on her back and grabbed hers over by his pants, sliding it back up his stomach. He broke away from her lips and studied her, still seeing her cringe at the slightest movement she made. \"You need to rest ok?\" he said as he sat up to lay her back down slowly. He lied back down, staring at her beautiful face. She sighed and raised her finger to trace the outline of his lips. \"I'm not going anywhere.\" He reassured her. She nodded happily and moved her hand toward his bicep. Her hand slid up his sleeve and she raised it up, exposing his large, black tattoo. She gazed over at it and began rubbing it as Tommy watched her with half closed eyes, enjoying her warm comforting hand on his skin. \"What does it mean?\" she asked. \"I've told you.\" He mumbled, dozing right off. Sarah met his eyes and smiled faintly. \"Yea I know but I want to hear it again.\" Tommy's eyes widened and he took a deep breath before he began. He told her all about that special crest his mom gave him before she died. She'd had it since he was born and told him it was \"one of a kind just like you.\" As the story began, Sarah lost interest in stroking his arm and locked their fingers together, intently staring into his eyes as if she was staring into his soul. When he was done, he watched as a tear fell from her eye and he did what he'd always do for her. He wiped it up and pulled her body close as their warm bodies comforted them both off to sleep. The bright day shined in on the two love birds as they lay sound asleep in each other's arms. Tommy's eyes slowly opened and the first thing that made sense in his sights was Sarah's delicate face resting peacefully on their intertwined hands. A closed mouth smile formed as he watched her snore quietly. He raised his hand and gently pushed the few loose hairs that lied scattered on her cheek behind her ear. Her eyes pushed their way open and she smiled the moment her vision bounced from fuzzy to clear. \"Morning.\" Sarah said before snuggling her way closer to Tommy, resting her head on his shoulder. \"Did you sleep ok?\" he asked. She was lost in his warmth and she struggled to grasp the most obvious concept until it became clear. She was his. \"Yea I did.\" She knew after answering that he asked for a reason. The same thought crossed Sarah's mind as soon as she opened her eyes and saw his face and with that, she looked up into his eyes. Their lips were almost drawn to each others like magnets as they kissed intensely. Tommy's hand caressed Sarah's cheek and she smiled in between their kiss. He slid it down toward the bottom of her shirt then made his way underneath. Tommy was pleasantly surprised to feel her bare breast as opposed to the texture of a bra. He rubbed his thumb over her nipples and she moaned into his mouth, throwing her arms around his neck. His hand freed her breasts and trailed down toward her entrance. He slipped his hand underneath her pants and underwear and gently began massaging her clit before sliding one finger inside her. He started out with one just to make sure she wasn't still hurting. When she didn't wince or pull away from his lips, he added another then another until it seemed like his full fist was fucking her. Her moans grew louder as she ripped off his shirt and pulled him on top of her. He slid his other hand securely behind her neck, sensually kissing her as he pulled his quite busy hand in and out of her. He did this until she pulled away from his lips to moan even louder in pleasure, gripping his back and crumbling as she came down from her intense high. Tommy was now fully erect and it wasn't long before Sarah was pulling both their shorts and underwear off along with her shirt. Sarah laid hungrily as she watched Tommy lick up all she gave him on his hand. He slid both arms underneath her, wanting a good grip and steady control of her body. His throbbing organ entered her slowly, going all the way in then pulling all the way out to test the waters. She moaned his name and kissed his neck as she rested her arms comfortably on his shoulders. He continued his slow steady rhythm and moaned her name in response. She spread her legs wider and this sky rocketed their lustful sensation. He wanted so desperately to bite and suck on her neck but he could still see the bright bruises and didn't think of even trying it. He slid his hand toward her lower back and lifted her up, curving her back and making them moan louder. Sarah lasted a good 15 minutes before she came, leaving her marks on Tommy's perfectly sculpted back. He met her lips and kissed her while releasing his firm grip on her back. His hand slid down her behind and landed on the back of her thigh, raising it up causing Tommy to maneuver his body to fuck her faster. He tried his hardest to stay hard but it became a challenge when every moan that came out of her mouth made him want to lose control. He rested his forehead on hers as he pumped faster and faster until she came again, wrapping her legs tightly around him. He slowed down his pace, still hard and ready for more. She threw herself at him and found herself on top. It wasn't long before he sat up too ready to make her go another round. She grabbed his face and kissed him, leaving no room in his mouth to breath as she rocked back and forth on his raging erection. She broke away from his lips and cocked her head to the side, hoping he would just take one bite now that the sensation for his lips was tingling in the very spot that was bruised. He looked at the bruises and leaned in to just softly brush his lips over them, refusing to take any chances hurting her. His warm breath and the feeling of his lips on her body made her ride his cock even harder. She placed her hands on each side of his pelvis, using them to keep her from falling over. He placed his hands on her breasts and pinched her nipples multiple times, making her moan his name. He grabbed her back and curved it, sending her on a frenzy as he kissed her from her stomach up, taking a stop at her breasts to suck and kiss them. Sarah leaned back up and kissed him, her tongue swirling freely in his mouth. She moved down from his lips to his neck then further down to his traps, his shoulders, licking up all the sweat. She went down further to each bicep, kissing them gently, then down to his pecs, sucking on his small yet perky nipples. He brought her face back up to his to kiss her again and they were lost in their intense love for each other. He lifted her higher and fucked her faster until they both came and she screamed with his moans following. They both took deep breaths. Sarah chuckled lightly and grabbed Tommy's face again. \"You can do whatever you want to me and it's always gonna feel this good.\" She said. Tommy chuckled lightly and pulled her in for another kiss. He used the little strength he did have to slide them both back to the front of the bed. He pulled out of Sarah and laid her in the middle of the bed, allowing his mouth to make it down toward her entrance. He kissed her before laying his eyes on her essence that glistened in the morning light. He slurped up every last drop he saw while Sarah was on the verge of her next orgasm. Her hand gripped a good chunk of his hair and in five minutes and the delightful skill of Tommy's tongue, she came and another stream of her cum oozed out of her and into Tommy's mouth. When she was done moaning uncontrollably, Tommy smoothly moved back up to her mouth and kissed her. He laid down beside her and wrapped his arms tightly around her as he pulled the bed sheet over them both. Sarah marveled at his face, not believing how many times she'd crumbled to him. He looked extremely drowsy and she didn't blame him. She was a few minutes away from dozing off herself but she raised her hand and began rubbing his chest. She used this vulnerable moment to her advantage and as he raised his hand to caress her face, she spoke. \"Why did you desert your unit?\" She asked. Tommy stopped and opened his eyes wider than the small slits they were before. Sarah moved her hand up to his cheek. \"Please tell me.\" She pleaded. He took a deep breath and nodded slowly, knowing full well he would have to tell her at some point. He parted his lips as he was about to begin when he stopped. Sarah froze and looked at Tommy, fear instantly clouding over her. She looked towards their hotel bedroom door along with Tommy as they heard someone mumbling in the main room. They couldn't make out a thing that was being said but they knew who was saying it. It was Paddy…. ","Summary":" Paddy drives slowly but attentively through a quiet, low lighted neighborhood. There's not a body i"},{"Movie":"Warrior, 2011","Title":"Hit Me Like A Man","Author":"Sailor-Sutty","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8601172","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Stop it! You're family! Families aren't supposed to hurt each other, they're supposed to protect and love each other!\" my mother yelled as she pulled me off my sister as I managed to get one more dig at her face that burst the top of her eyebrow. \"I'm fucking leaving!\" I said grabbing my gym bag. \"Why can't you two get along you used to be so close when you were kids\" she said her breath catching in her throat with panic. I know this seems like a typical sibling fight but it wasn't. My sister and I haven't seen eye to eye in years. Everything was fine until I showed up on the doorstep looking for a place to stay. Unfortunately my sister was still sponging off my mother's limited means while I stupidly moved out with someone who I thought loved me, Peter, but actually just wanted to use me as a punch bag and of course, me being the little weak girl I was, let him. It was only until he came in one night drunk as a monkey and bet me until I was an inch from death did I decide I needed to do something about this. I secretly began going to the gym, taking the beatings as usual biding my time until after about a year I was lean and strong enough to hit back. I had found a gym that trained boxers and specialised in martial arts so I asked if they could train me. At first they weren't going to do it but once I told them my reasoning and saw how I focused my anger into the punch bag, they were more than happy to have me. I waited and waited and waited until the ultimate test was put before me. I had to fight one of the guys in the gym. The first round I got my arse kicked but then I noticed his moves so when the second round came, I was ready for him. I bopped around and got in around him and managed to knee him in the ribs... So that night I knew it was time. He came home drunk as usual, ripped off the sheet from over me on the bed and climbed on top. He was so drunk he couldn't even undo his trousers. While I waited for him to lose his patience and start laying into me I was planning my attack. I had angled my body so my hands were free to start laying into him. He slapped my face lightly trying to wake me and when I refused I could feel him raising his fist. I caught it mid-air and used his surprise to head-butt him right between the eyes. He fell to the side and I clambered on top and proceeded to pound his face into the mattress. I heard him wheezing under me, his face throbbing along with my knuckles and I knew I was done. I packed what I had left to pack and left. \"Mom, can you not see she's a parasite? She's living off you until you have no more. She uses your money to buy pills and booze for her and her skanky boyfriend!\" I yelled as I filled up my water bottle. I knew she was listening but she knew mom would never believe me. \"Yea coz your guy was a regular Prince Charming\" she scowled. \"Where are you going?\" my mother questioned ignoring my sister's snide comment. \"I'm going to the gym\" I said shoving past my sister in the tiny hallway. I began to jog, too annoyed to just walk. I was breaking out in a sweat by the time I got to the gym. I said hey to everyone I knew not bothered to get involved with small talk. I went into the same toilet to get changed since there was no female dressing room. I don't blame them; I'm the only female that uses this gym. It's not really worth it for one person. I walked out and saw immediately there was someone on my bag. Mousey brown hair, thick with muscle, tattoos stretched across his thick arms…pretty average clientele of this gym. He seemed pretty engrossed in his workout so I decided not to say anything to him. I walked to the bag next to that one. He didn't even look up as I walked past throwing my blonde hair up in a messy pony tail. From time to time I glanced at this new guy. I had never seen him before, believe me I would have noticed him. He eventually stopped and took a long drink. He glanced over at me and I looked up. \"Hey\" I panted. He just ignored me and turned towards the ring in the centre of the floor. What a prick. He tore off his gloves and waltzed over. I stopped to take a drink and watched what was going on while my heart beat in my ears. He mumbled something to the main trainer before walking off. Then I heard the main man fighting in this big Sparta match that all the guys have been banging on about for weeks say something to him. He turned back and mumbled something else. I got more curious so I moved more towards the ring as this new guy hopped straight in. He whipped off his hoody and threw it to the corner before getting his hands strapped up with tape. He wasn't going to fight him was he? He'll be killed. I walked towards the ring spraying water into my mouth watching. He looked back around at me again; his stare boring into my eyes before turning back around. I knew this was going to be the last time I'd see him because Mad Dog is going to crush him. But then out of nowhere this new kid threw a sharp kick to Mad Dog which took him by surprise followed by well-placed punches and kicks to the lower body before repeated blows to the head before he was unconscious. It was all over in an instance and I stood there mouth agape. He mumbled something to Carl before hopping out of the ring back towards me. \"What?\" he mumbled. \"Nothing…that was amazing\" He just shrugged his shoulders and wiped his face. \"I haven't seen you around\" \"Yea and\" \"What's your name?\" He just ignored me like I wasn't even there. \"What kind of girl are you, in a place like this?\" \"I'm a girl all right just had to deal with an abusive boyfriend that needed to be taught a lesson\" \"Stupid fuck\" \"Excuse me?\" \"Staying with an abusive boyfriend? What kind of dumb bitch are you?\" he muttered packing his bag. Unbeknownst to me, images were flashing through his mind of the abuse his mother had suffered, which he was witness to. He shook his head slightly trying to blur the horrible images running through his mind. \"Excuse me but who the fuck do you think you are?\" I shouted. He picked up his bag, fixed his woolly hat on his head and walked past me storming out the door but not before stopping and giving me an icy glare. I punched the bag in a rage. \"Did you see that prick?\" I shouted at the trainer. \"That prick just knocked out my best bet for winning Sparta\" he snapped slapping Mad Dog's cheeks every so often. I was so pissed off I worked out and didn't feel the hours roll by. Before I knew it they were closing up the gym for the night. I got changed and went to find my trainer only to run into the owner. \"Hey I'm leaving, see you tomorrow\" \"Hey actually hold up a second!\" he said shouting from the office. \"I saw you talking to Tommy earlier\" \"Who's Tommy?\" \"The guy who punched out Mad Dog…you were talking to him earlier, you don't have any info about where he might be now do you?\" \"Eh no, I didn't even know his name. I tried but he just called me a dumb bitch and left so we're hardly best friends\" I said shrugging my shoulders. \"O ok right well we have an address…anyway I'll talk to you tomorrow yea?\" \"Yea cool\" I said turning on my heel and walking out the door. Why was he all of a sudden so interested in that prick? I blocked that dickhead I had encountered in the gym that day out of my mind. When I got home I noticed the house was in darkness. Where was everyone? I switched on the lamp in the living room and saw my mother asleep on the couch. I crept quietly out and into the kitchen but someone switched on the light before I got a chance. It was Peter. \"Hey Erika\" he smiled. \"Peter what the fuck are you doing here? Does my mother know you're here?\" \"Are you kidding? No, I crept in while she was asleep, must be whacked out on pills because that was hours ago\" he said glancing at the clock. \"What do you want?\" \"I'm here because…well I wasn't too fond of what you did last time\" he said taking off his sport coat. Looks like I wasn't the only one who bulked up recently. He was a tank. He was always big but it was more soft and flabby than muscle but now…he was ripped and I was in trouble. I knew it; he had come here to tune me up since I did it to him the last time. But this time I was ready for him. Just as I was getting into my starter position another guy I didn't recognise emerged from the darkness of the laundry room. I felt my stomach drop and I started to sweat. \"It occurred to me…since you were Miss fighting champion all of a sudden…\" he said taking a long piece of wood out from behind the bin and I noticed cable ties sticking out of his pocket \"I thought I'd come prepared…like you did that night\" he sneered. This was about pride and ego more than anything else. Peter wouldn't like the fact a girl had knocked him out, that would eat away at him inside. \"Now I'm giving you an option…come home with me now or…well you're smart enough to figure out the rest\" I had already marked the door I came in for my escape but I suppose if you live with someone long enough they get to grips with your moves. \"And don't run…like a rat because if you do who's gonna look after your ma?\" he sneered. He laughed lowly to himself watching my reaction. The sudden realisation that I could be leaving my house tomorrow in a box hit me like a fucking train.[Chapter 2] So my options were I could get beaten and possibly killed or I could back to Peter… \"Peter you can fuck off you don't scare me now\" I said stupidly facing up to a man with backup who had about 20 pounds on me and a weapon but that was me, a fucking fool. He sniggered and his mate sniggered as well. He lifted the wooden plank within a blink and had belted me across the face with it. I landed on the ground with a thud my face instantly numb. \"Darren, cable ties!\" he mocked as I struggled to gain focus of the spinning room. I felt my hands being dragged behind me and tied tight with a cable tie. \"Do I scare you now? Huh? Ungrateful bitch\" he spat. I tried to turn around onto my back and was met with Peter landing a vicious kick to my face. \"You're not so tough now are you?\" He hauled me up under my arms and threw me on a chair grabbing a fist full of hair forcing me to look at him, my eye already starting to sell. \"You know what...\" he spoke as I spluttered up some blood. \"You're not looking in great shape for an ultimate fighting whatsit\" \"I'm…I'm not a…fighter\" I struggled to spit out. \"Yea you're just like all those fucking idiots at that gym you hang out in. Guys who watch too much UFC on TV and think they're the next big thing, think they're actual fighters\" I immediately thought of Tommy, he was probably one of those wankers, breezes in thinks he's the shit, pounds a couple of guys into the mat and thinks he's a machine. \"Why do you hang out with those losers? Why don't you do something with your life?\" \"O like you\" I laughed lowly which really hurt. \"Excuse me?\" \"You push drugs on 15 year old kids, watch them swap needles and diseases while you count your cash in the car and you want to talk about me hanging out losers\" I felt my lip starting to swell and burn. His lip twitched and I knew I had struck a nerve. He struck me across the face, his watch catching the side of my face opening a huge cut right across my cheek. He wiped the blood off his hand and fixed the strap that had come undone. \"C'mon Darren let's go\" \"What? We're just leavin her here?\" \"Yea we'll be back, don't worry, she ain't going anywhere. Remember what I said about your ma\" he whispered in my ear. He grabbed his wooden bat and walked out the door leaving me there with my hands still tied. I breathed heavily when I heard him eventually closed the front door. I let my head loll back in the chair and the blood slowly trickled into my hair line. I didn't move from the chair until my mother eventually woke up and cut the cable ties. She wanted me to go to the doctor to see if I needed stiches but the last thing I was going to do was explain to my doctor why I looked like someone's punch bag. \"Why were you passed out on the couch? You're not on that shit again are you mam?\" \"No I just took a few sleeping pills…I was a bit stressed dealing with your sister\" she said handing me a mug of tea. I held my face in my hands. The last time she was on sleeping pills she nearly overdosed. It was only that I came home from work early and found her that she's here today. But I knew the risks I ran coming back home. Once again I was going to be the one responsible for taking care of my mother. \"Where did you go today?\" she said looking into the sink avoiding looking at my battered face \"I'm going to bed\" I said taking my mug upstairs. I cleaned my face and went to bed ready to just forget everything that happened today. My phone alarm buzzed loudly on my side table. I turned it around seeing 5a.m. blink back at me. It was still dark out but I swung my legs out of bed and rubbed my eyes. I wobbled to the bathroom and the light buzzed on and I waited for my eyes to adjust to the light before I got a look at Peter's work. My face was even sorer now that the adrenaline had worn off. My eye was bruised and puffed out, the cut on my cheek was hot, red and had started to scab and the whole left side of my face was bruised from the bat. I wrapped a scarf around my neck pulling it up over my face and pulled a hat down before putting my hood up and starting my morning jog. There's something different about jogging at this hour of the morning. The air in my lungs felt clearer and the layer of mist hovering over the cold concrete settled over my shoes. I reached the bridge, the halfway point and I noticed a car over the other side of the bridge. I stopped and jogged on the spot for a moment occasionally grabbing my leg and pulling it up behind me watching to see what the car was doing. I suddenly saw someone come from stretching at the bonnet. I strained my eyes trying to look through the darkness but I could feel myself cooling down so I had to start back running. I jogged warily over the long bridge and sketched to the edge away from the car and saw the guy stretching himself against the car. He had a woolly hat pulled down just before his eyes and a hood up. I haven't seen him out running here before. Actually I've never seen anyone out running at this time in the morning. I got to the gym and saw that it was totally empty, just the way I like it. I whipped off my sweaty hoody, hat and scarf and threw them in the corner. I heard a creak from the door behind me and saw Tommy trundle out of the dressing room. He kept his head down but his eyes looked up and met mine. He was the last person I wanted to see. \"Morin'\" he mumbled. His voice cracked like it does when you haven't spoken since you woke up. \"Morning\" I said trying to avoid looking at him. I knew he was looking at my face. I sat down on the bench and began to tape my hands. Tommy stood there in the same spot and I could feel the heat of his gaze. After I taped up my hands, I looked up and his gaze was still boring into my skull. \"What?\" I snapped. \"Sup with your face?\" he mumbled. \"Got in a fight\" \"In one of those girly fightin' in your bra type fights while old guys jerk off at the side of the ring?\" \"No\" \"O\" Five more minutes passed and I fidgeted on the bench while he continued to stare. I met his stare and stuck my tongue up under my top lip. \"So who tuned you up?\" \"Why do you care?\" \"I don't\" \"Well fuck off then\" \"Fine I dunno thought you might wanna talk bout' it that's all\" I think that's what he said his voice faded out into a quiet mummer. \"Why would I talk to you about it?\" He didn't say anything else just started punching the bag. But for some reason all my energy seemed to be gone and I didn't feel like working out. I sat there and could feel my muscles starting to tense, my warm up wearing off. My elbows rested on my knees and I held my battered face in my hands. \"How's the boyfriend?\" he suddenly spoke still pounding the bag. \"Excuse me?\" \"Well your boy obviously did that to you after you went back to him\" \"And how do you know that? Coz you know fucking everything do ya?\" I said standing up and squaring up to him. He looked me dead in the eye and I saw the muscles jutting from his neck twitch slightly. \"Believe me I know the look of a woman tuned up by a man\" \"You know what Tommy, you don't know shit\" I sneered into his face. His lip twitched the same twitch Peter gets when you hit a nerve. I involuntarily winced, my eyes ready for the beating that inevitably follows that twitch. Tommy just laughed lowly to himself. \"What you think I'm gonna hit you? I don't hit little girls unlike your boy\" For some reason that line made me want to burst into tears. I suppose you only realise how bad something is until you hear someone else say it to your face. His eyes moved from my eye to my cheek to the other side of my face that was black and blue. \"He belt you with a baseball bat or somethin'\" \"Just…leave me alone\" I said grabbing my hoody and storming out the door. I wasn't in any mood to fight anymore either with Tommy or the punch bag. I got home and no one was up yet. I went into my room and lay on the bed thinking until I eventually drifted into sleep. It wasn't a heavy sleep, I remember waking up slightly hearing my mother call my name throughout the house and when she entered my room and wrapped the duvet around me. I woke up a few hours later still engulfed in heat but my hair sticking to my head with the sweat. I could smell my mother's cooking wafting through the small house but I felt really unwell from the stress of everything and the fact I hadn't trained at all today. I heard my mother answering the front door as I threw my legs out of bed for the second time today. I couldn't hear what was being said I just heard the mummer of my mother's voice and the muffled voice of the stranger. \"Erika!\" she suddenly called as I heard the front door close. I warily walked down the stairs and met my mother trying hard to whisper but who was in effect shouting quietly. \"There's a boy to see you\" \"A boy?\" I still think she thinks I'm like eight years old or something. \"Yea he's in the living room\" I jumped the rest of the steps and pushed the door to the living room revealing Tommy walking up and down the room like a lion in a cage. \"Tommy what the fuck are you doing here?\" \"You left your scarf at the gym\" he said throwing it to me. \"How did you find out where I lived?\" \"The contact sheet at the gym…well I'll be going\" He proceeded to walk out the door but was met by my mother who was probably listening in at the door. \"Would you like to stay for dinner?\" \"No\" myself and Tommy replied. \"Of course you will, strapping young man like yourself, ya gotta eat\" she smiled. So the little woman led the tank by the arm into her little kitchen and sat him down in the wooden chair at the dinner table that creaked under his weight. \"So Tommy what do you do with yourself?\" \"I'm a fighter\" \"O really, my Erika is quite the little fighter too\" \"Yea I know she is, we train at the same gym\" I sat down and watched them have a whole conversation about me like I wasn't even there. \"How come she's never brought you home before?\" \"Ah I just got back into town\" he said eyeing up the steaming dish my mother just put on the table. \"Needed this old vet to help me train\" \"What are you training for?\" my mother smiled handing him a plate. \"Sparta\" he said staring straight at me. I raised an eyebrow and reached for a plate. I love you all btw, just thought I'd let you know :) All my readers and reviewers of all my fanfics and I am working on updates for other stories so dont worry :) You're all heroes -Sailor[Chapter 3] Hey guys! Hope everyone is well, here's my new chapter for Warrior. I put a new chapter of my Dark Knight Rises story if anyone else is reading that and I'll have another one up soon :) So enjoy and just once again I love you all :D Enjoy! -Sailor After dinner and the probing by my mother into everything to do with him and his family Tommy eventually got up to leave. It's funny he didn't seem interested in talking to me at all at the gym. He barely spoke two words to me on any given day and yet he was yapping happily to my mother as he went for seconds and third helpings of her Shepard's pie. \"Thanks for the dinner Mrs Coonan, it was greatly appreciated\" he smiled. He smiled, he actually smiled. I have never seen him smile and it pained me to admit but he actually had quite a warm, friendly, welcoming smile. But as soon as he turned to me, that smile was gone and it was the frosty face of the Tommy I knew from the gym. My mother hung back in the kitchen to clean up but was watching me as I walked him to the door out of habit more than anything else. \"I suppose I'll see you tomorrow\" \"Yea…\" I said flatly. \"I normally go for a jog in the morning first\" I said really just for something to say to fill the awkward silence. \"So that was you\" he laughed. \"What?\" \"I was thinking it was you that ran past me the other morning. I was stretching my legs against my old man's car and you sketched by\" \"Your old man?\" He stopped before the door and turned around to continue the conversation. Tommy's huge shoulders made the already small hallway seem even smaller and we were inches from each other but the distance between us was greater than ever. \"I thought you trained with an old vet?\" He licked his lips and looked down at the ground. \"Yea he's my pop\" \"Why didn't you just say that?\" \"Because I don't consider him my father\" he sneered. I got the feeling not to push it. I didn't say anything and he sighed heavily. \"I'll see you tomorrow I guess…\" he said his hand on the doorknob. Before he got a chance to open it someone from outside pushed the door causing it to knock against him. It was Peter. \"This is very cosy\" he said pushing his way past. \"So Erika you've got a meat head here for protection\" he sniggered. Now Tommy had at least about 20 pounds on Peter but Peter was taller. \"Excuse me?\" Tommy growled squaring up to Peter. \"You can speak can you?\" he laughed. \"Peter, stop\" \"So what you're the new squeeze, are you?\" \"Tommy, go I'll talk to you tomorrow\" I said standing between them trying to get Tommy out the door. \"Yea Tommy, go. This is a private matter\" said Peter putting his arm on my shoulder to which I immediately pushed it off. \"So what so you can take up where you left off?\" Peter's lip twitched and I knew this was going to end badly. Besides I didn't need Tommy here, Peter didn't have back up or a weapon so I should have been able to handle this. Also my mother was in the kitchen so I wouldn't imagine Peter would do something while she was there \"You think you're a big man beating on a little girl?\" \"Hey!\" I protested. \"Can we please dial down the male ego and testosterone here? Tommy! Go!\" Tommy met Peter's stare and reluctantly opened the door. Just as he had a foot out the door, my mother appeared from the kitchen. \"You scumbag what are you doing back here!\" she screamed. \"This is my house and I'm not afraid of you and I will not be pushed around in my own home, so get out!\" she yelled at Peter who was slightly taken aback. \"No offense, but this has nothing to do with you\" \"If it concerns my daughter then it has something to do with me\" Tommy took this as his cue to grab him by the shoulders, drag him down the driveway and throw him onto the street. \"If I get a snifter that you come back harassing those women, you'll have me to answer to\" I heard Tommy growl. My mother of course, loved this. For a woman that spent the majority of her adult life being mistreated by men she didn't half love having them around. She even used to say a woman needs a good man in her life. What happens if she gets attacked in the street or if she needs something on top of a very high shelf? She made a point to tell me as long as he's not like your father. \"Mother, I don't need him fighting my battles\" which she ignored. Tommy strode back up to the house to which my mother hugged him and thanked him and I physically felt ill. \"Tommy I didn't need you to do that\" \"Yes we did!\" hissed my mother. \"No we didn't Mam! We survived perfectly well without a man in our lives for years! Why do you think we need one now! Peter doesn't scare me!\" I said getting slightly over emotional due to my anger bubbling over. \"What's the point in me training and working and sweating if you think I need some big strong knight to save the day?!\" I ran up the stairs and locked my bedroom door. I didn't even mean to get that angry but every feeling I had for Tommy was gone in an instant. I wasn't even thankful for him throwing Peter out because I could have done that myself. Whatever little time I had for him before was now completely gone. I don't even know how long he stayed if he even stayed at all after my little outburst. I woke up the next morning after getting very little sleep and got changed into my sweats. My sister was falling up the stairs obviously just getting home stinking of whiskey, tripped into the bathroom laughing. I picked her up and threw her outside and she was even too drunk to protest. My needs were greater than hers besides I had a gym schedule to keep, she was just a drunk. To my surprise, my mother met me in the kitchen clutching a coffee cup at the table. \"Ma…it's like 5.30 in the morning\" I croaked. \"I know, I know what time you get up at\" I looked at her puffy eyes, she had been crying. \"Ma, what's wrong?\" \"I just want you to be safe\" \"Jesus Ma don't start\" \"Erika…\" \"Are you seriously telling me you got up to tell me this?!\" \"Look I've been around the block. I was with an abusive man for years…and I know a good one when I see him\" She was not so subtly referring to Tommy. \"Ok, first of all I'm not going back to Peter I thought that was clear?\" \"But how many times did I say that darling? Tommy…\" \"MA! You don't even know him! You met him for an hour at dinner…and actually what makes you think I need a man at all? Let alone some meat head who doesn't know the difference between a ding dong and his elbow?! And while we're going down this road, Tommy doesn't like me, I can assure you of that! Now I'm going and I don't want another word about this are we clear?\" \"Just…\" \"Ah!\" \"Ok I'm just concerned…\" \"Yea well Ma here's a newsflash, I'm not as stupid as you! I wouldn't repeat your mistakes!\" I said before storming out the door. Ok that was really harsh on my part but it needed to be said. Maybe now she'll shut the fuck up about Tommy. I pulled my hood over my head and started jogging towards the gym as the sun yawned and began to stretch its muscles.[Chapter 4] Hey guys! Hope life is going well for you all and I hope you're enjoying the story so far :) Thanks for my reviewers and generally everyone who has read it, I love you all. That's it really I hope you like this chapter and sure why not stick an aule review if you're so inclined. Thanks guys! Love you! -Sailor When I got to the gym, the place was totally empty as usual. I threw my stuff in my usual corner and went to the bathroom to fix my hair. I noticed my face was healing nicely, the bruising was still there but the cuts weren't as sore and the scabbing had stopped any infection. But I still looked awful I can't sugar coat that. I walked back out, sat down and started taping my hands. The door opened and I immediately looked up expecting…except it wasn't Tommy. An old man hobbled in his knees clearly not what they used to be. \"Excuse me, have you seen my son? Big guy…tattoos\" I could only imagine who he was describing… \"Is his name Tommy by any chance?\" \"Yea that's him you know him?\" \"Only know him to see\" I lied fixing the tape tight around my hands. It seems that lately nothing in my life can happen without Tommy or someone related to Tommy being involved. \"He's supposed to be here getting warmed up…we're going to the yard\" he said glancing at his watch. \"He's training for Sparta you know…\" this aule fella was just gonna keep on talking no matter how much I didn't listen. \"Yea asked for the ole man's help and sure why not, gets me out of the house. He talks about all these new training techniques but I tell him there aint nothing wrong with the old ways. Picking up a tractor wheel and pushing it forward, keep the ole shoulders in good nick\" he just kept going. \"Very proud of him I am. Used to wrestle as a kid you know…\" Then the door to the dressing room nearly swung off its hinges and Tommy bounded out. He walked past me, ignoring me and grabbed his bag, pulling out his water bottle. He walked over to the fountain and began filling it up while his father continued to praise him. \"Very proud of my boy, really glad he's back home I gotta say\" wow this guy clearly wasn't aware of how much of a douchebag his son really is. \"Do you fight yourself?\" he said clearly wondering what was going on with my face. \"I fought a few times, but nothing major. I really just do the training\" \"Yea you know those fights where women claw at each other in their bras drowning in spunk from the old guys around the ring. Not proper fighting pop\" mumbled Tommy screwing the cap back on his bottle. I noticed he had a few cuts and lumps gone out of his hands, stupid fuck probably thinking he doesn't need gloves to fight anymore because he's 'o so tough'. I shot him a glare but I thought better of it than to call him a prick in front of his elderly father. \"Tommy that's not a very nice thing to say\" he said fixing his cap. \"Fuck off Tommy will ya\" I muttered. \"Don't worry I'm going c'mon pop\" he ordered as he walked out the door. \"Right so Tommy, it was nice chatting with you…\" \"Erika\" \"Erika. Have a good day kid\" he smiled. It was nice to have the gym to myself I gotta say. It was nice to just do my work out without worrying about arguing with Tommy…was kinda quiet though. I figured I'd go out for something to eat after my workout just to do something different. I walked the few minutes up the road from the gym to the café and sat in a booth. I noticed the waitress and I knew she recognised me by the way she was looking at me. She used to go to school with me. \"Erika!\" she exclaimed. \"Hey Sarah how's things?\" \"Ah shit, stuck in this dead end job\" she mumbled realising her boss was only feet from her. \"Did I not hear you got accepted into college?\" \"Yea dropped out…wasn't for me so I packed it in and came home and now I'm here. What are you up to?\" \"Ah nothing much, I moved out a while ago but it didn't work out so now I'm back home. Been at the gym a lot\" \"Yea you've really bulked up; do you do boxing or something?\" \"Yea mixture of that and a couple of other things, I'm thinking of entering some competitions you know test the waters or something\" \"Yea totally! You're built for it…actually now you mention that, some guy dropped a load of flyers in here earlier…\" she said looking through the pocket in her apron. \"It said something about female fight night…\" she said pulling it out. \"Sure might as well check it out…\" A loud cough came from the suit behind her and she looked back around rolling her eyes. \"Suppose I should get back to work…you want to order something?\" \"Yea sure, can I have a diet coke and the BLT?\" \"Sure no problem\" she smiled \"It was nice catching up, we should go for a drink some evening\" I nodded and smiled while she went to fetch my drink. It was a shock to the system seeing her working in a shitty café. She was the bright star of the class. Good at everything, took higher levels subjects when they didn't even offer them at my school. I believe I heard a few teachers refer to her as 'gifted' and now she was stuck in a dead end job going nowhere. She brought me my dinner and wandered off to clean some tables. At graduation she was the one all the teachers told us was going to go far while the rest of us were stuck here forever. I glanced at the leaflet she put on my table. It read \"Female fight night! Watch the sexist women in the world of boxing and martial arts battle it out for the grand prize, 500 dollars! Parking lot of Spearmint Rhino, Friday night 11.30\" I mulled over it while eating my dinner…looking around and watching Sarah after her fall from grace really made me think about my own life. I think it's definitely time to get serious… \"Well look who it is\" I suddenly heard from behind me. Before I got a chance to turn around my sister slid into the seat in front of me. \"What do you want?\" \"Well I was just meeting Damian here, grab some food before we head out\" he said with a sickly smile on her face. \"What are your plans for the evening?\" I asked more so out of habit than actually out of care. \"Just heading back, watch a movie etc.\" I raised my eyebrows pretending to still be listening. I knew what etc. meant, stick up with the same needle and pass out in the living room. I chewed on a bite of my sandwich along with the crisps that were haphazardly thrown on the side of the plate. I glanced at the scar on her eyebrow, I still felt good I burst her eye, not going to lie but she was smiling like a fucking tool and it was really irritating me. \"What the fuck are you grinning at?\" \"Someone had a visitor today\" I ignored her. I wasn't going to play into her hands, begging her to tell me who it was, she was such a child. I cleared my throat and continued eating. \"Don't you want to know who it was?\" \"Not really, no\" After about a minute I knew it was killing her that I didn't care. \"He was a beaut\" she grinned. I immediately knew who she was talking about. \"I don't care; don't forget though you do have a \"boyfriend\" if you could call him that\" \"Seriously I would dump him for this guy\" \"True love is officially alive and well\" \"His body is just…\" she made a noise I can't describe although I would imagine its some noise she makes during sex. \"That's right\" I sighed chewing on a piece of lettuce \"It's all about the physical…\" \"Shame it wasn't me he was interested in talking to…\" she said in a really sarcastic tone. \"Jamie\" \"Yea?\" \"I still don't care\" \"Well he seemed to care a lot. He waited there for a good hour after ma insisted of course. He can really talk you know. In fact I got the impression he had something serious he needed to say to you…\" she said clearly fishing for answers. Although the man she described certainly doesn't sound like the Tommy I know. \"Jamie no offence but you're a drunk and a junkie. The day I start taking your impression of a conversation on board is the day I officially lose all faith in humanity\" This seemed to just roll off her back because her only response was a slight shrug and robbing some crisps off my plate. \"So I have a question…where does someone like you, because let's be honest here just ew\" she says referring to my whole demeanour and attitude I'm presuming \"meet an absolute beaut like him\" \"Jamie…\" \"And actually are two going to be like dating now? Coz that's majorly weird…\" \"Jamie…\" I sneered again. \"And you just know Peter is going to have something to say about you two banging each other\" \"Jamie!\" I roared banging the table. \"This has got nothing to do with you and if you go mouthing off to people saying what you just said you're gonna find yourself in serious shit I'm not messing\" I sneered, something inside me fearing slightly that Peter might hear and seek us out. \"Fine…Jesus sis it's always nice chatting to you\" she said getting up. \"Fuckin bitch…\" I heard her mummer under her breath as she walked away. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, he seemed to just be a reoccurring character in my life which just pissed me off more to be honest. He was at my house again today, what does he want now? I grabbed the flyer, threw the money on the table, said bye to Sarah and headed for home. I got to the end of my driveway and fished through my bag for my keys when I heard a car door creak open across the street. Someone got out and called over, it was Tommy. I rolled my eyes and I could feel a growl come from deep within my chest. \"You're fucking waiting outside my house watching from your car like some sort of fuckin serial killer? The fuck's the matter with you?\" I said walking over to his beat up car. \"I wanted to talk to you and I wasn't sure what time you'd be home\" \"What is it?\" \"Sit in the car\" I crossed my arms not moving. \"Sit in the fuckin car\" he ordered. I pulled open the door and sat in my anger already starting to boil over. I threw my bag onto the floor and waited for him to speak. He looked even bigger in the small car also helped by the fact he appeared to wearing two jumpers and a jacket. \"My pop told me he chewing the ears off you this morning…\" \"Tommy seriously…\" \"Seriously will you just shut up for two seconds and let me speak!\" he yelled. Clearly speaking to me is such a herculean task he feels the need to fill it with small talk before actually saying anything of value. I closed my mouth and told myself that I was going to let him speak. Even though when I tried to talk to him the first day I met him he ignored me and threw many an insult at me…but I was holding that for a later argument. \"Has your boy been back?\" \"No\" I snapped. \"Have you spoken to him?\" \"No\" \"That's because he'll find it hard to talk with no teeth\" \"What? What did you do?\" He gazed out the windscreen that was starting to get foggy from the inside. \"He needed to be taught a lesson\" he croaked. \"I can't believe I'm hearing this. You smashed his face in?\" \"Pretty much yea\" just like that, like it was nothing \"he won't be bothering you again\" \"And why did you take it upon yourself to do this? That wasn't your decision to make!\" I could tell by his face he wasn't telling me everything. \"What?\" \"He was going to kill you, d'ya know that?\" I crinkled my nose in disgust. \"I overheard him talking in a bar about you that night. He was going to wait for you to come out the gym one evening and get you while you were walking home, smash your head in with a pipe or somethin'. He didn't know I could hear him or who I was; I had my hood up so I waited outside for him…\" \"So instead of telling me you decided to take matters into your own hands\" \"Yes because…because you wouldn't have been able to handle it I know about these things!\" his voice suddenly cracked and he punched the steering wheel in anger. \"How would you know?\" \"I couldn't stop it before…\" he said his eyes becoming glazed over \"when I was a kid…and after he tuned you up with the bat…since I could stop it this time I decided I would…\" suddenly all this raw emotion I had never seen before was coming to the surface. \"I get it you're tough…but it's not just about being physically tough…my ma was tough…and yet we had to drive across the country to…to get away…you have to be mentally strong as well…and you say you could handle it and yet he just kept coming back…\" I was getting slightly confused but I decided not to ask questions and while his whole story was hitting me hard in the chest I had to retain a tough exterior…that's just the way I was. The air was getting heavy in the car and the emotions were certainly running high. This was a side to Tommy I had never seen before \"So to make you feel better you tuned him up, well thanks a bunch Tommy you've effectively handed me a death sentence. Tell me what happens when he's all healed and out for revenge and you've fucked off to Atlantic City for Sparta in a few weeks never to return? We all can't just fuck off at the drop of a hat you know! Who's he gonna be coming looking for when you're not around huh? Who's he gonna beat to a bloody pulp or possibly kill? Can you answer me that?\" Tears formed in his eyes but only one or two fell showing his raw interior, the interior he kept hidden from everyone, every day. His breathing jolted and got caught in his chest as he tried to control it. \"No I didn't think you could\" I said my own voice cracking involuntarily out of fear. I slammed the car door and walked into my house and didn't leave my bedroom for two days.[Chapter 5] Hey guys! How's things going with you peeps? :) Hope you enjoy this chapter, I love all my readers and reviewers. I was watching Warrior last night and Tommy deffo needs some loving but is Erika capable of it? That's it for now so enjoy folks! :D -Sailor After about a week of sitting around the house eating and watching TV I could feel my body starting to turn to mush. I couldn't face going to the gym and seeing Tommy after the bust up we had. There were many reasons for this but none that I would like to discuss…but I'm not going to lie, I was scared. And I never admit to that. I was scared for me and as much as I hated to admit to myself I was scared for Tommy as well. Peter knew dangerous people I know he's in hospital counting the days. Tommy was leaving for Sparta soon and the chances were he wasn't coming back so maybe it was for the best. Hopefully I could convince Peter not to smash my head in with a pipe or maybe I'll have done something with my life by then and I won't be here. But for now I was sitting in my house trying to avoid any contact with the outside world. But I knew my constant presence in the house was getting on my mother's nerves. She came into the sitting room while I was watching television and perched herself on the couch adjacent to the arm chair I was sitting in. I knew she wanted to talk so I stared at the screen avoiding eye contact with her. \"Erika\" I knew that tone of voice, she was pissed. \"Ma…\" \"Why haven't you been going to the gym?\" \"Don't feel like it\" \"Erika\" I turned up the Steve Wilkos show to try and drown her out. \"We both know what this is about\" \"No we don't\" I hissed, my fuse starting to burn out. \"Yes we do…I met Tommy with his father in the store the other day\" They must follow each other around or something. \"He told me what happened\" \"So you two are like BFF's now?\" \"He told me he hasn't seen you in the gym\" \"And what did you tell him?\" \"I didn't tell him anything, I know what you're like…but he told me what you said to him…about when he leaves for Sparta and now it all makes sense…it was only when he told me exactly what happened that it all started to fall into place\" I turned the television up again. \"I'm your mother I know you inside out. You don't want to get close to Tommy because he's leaving for Sparta…and since Peter you're so afraid of a repeat of that that you don't want to feel you need to rely on anyone\" That thing I didn't want to discuss earlier was now spilling out in front of me. \"I don't need anyone Ma!\" \"You only think that, you're just afraid of your own feelings! You think the best way to keep your heart from being broken is to pretend you don't have one!\" \"Why can't you get this through your head…?\" \"I know your dad wasn't a good man but you can't think all men are like that and Tommy is a good one I know he is. And you can't use one bad experience as a basis for the rest of your life\" \"So what do you suggest?\" \"Tell him\" I snorted in derision. \"I hope you're joking…Ma I don't care what you think you know. The fact of the matter is Tommy has come into my life and caused nothing but trouble and the sooner…the sooner he leaves for Sparta the better!\" I said feeling my throat close up. Tommy has just burrowed under my skin and I can't get rid of him. \"You can't see it can you? You two are cut from the same cloth\" \"You seriously need a life of your own\" \"I just don't want you to throw away something that's in your best interest because you think everyone is out to get you\" I lifted myself up out of the chair and stormed out the door leaving it swinging open as I bounded towards the gym. I threw the double doors opened and everyone stopped what they were doing and looked up. \"Where is he?\" I growled at Mad Dog who was standing in the ring. \"Tommy\" \"Tommy Riordan?\" I could see in his eyes his name still bothered him ever since he pounded his face into the mat. \"He's in the dressing room\" said another meat head spitting out his gum shield. I ran towards the door with little male sign on the door and threw myself at it with barrages of \"you can't go in there!\" but no one was going to stop me. I breathed through my flared nostrils scanning around looking for him. I walked into the locker room and found him lying on the ground with his legs stretched up against the wall, his arms spread out and his hands taped up. \"Tommy! Get up!\" he leaned his head back, his eyes rolling up and glaring at me. He lifted himself off the ground and straightened up. He had that same look of disinterest he always has plastered on his face. \"Tommy!\" I roared and then I just screamed I had no idea what to say to be honest so I punched a locker and screamed. He stood there the same stance and look. \"Tommy, stop telling my mother stories ok! You have caused nothing but problems in my life!\" \"What because I care enough to do something to make sure you don't get your head smashed in!\" \"Tommy! That is none of your concern!\" I yelled, the words spilling from my mouth laced with saliva, my lips quivering, adrenaline pumping through my veins causing my whole body to shake. I marched over and spat the words inches from his face. \"What happens when you leave me here?\" He grabbed my shoulders, swung me around and smashed me against the locker. \"Why can't you just be thankful for what happened?! He was gonna kill you! Why can't you get that through your head?\" he growled. \"And why do you care?!\" He opened his mouth but closed it just as quick. \"Get your hands off me! You like to think you're a big man?!\" He growled to himself, his neck muscles shaking with fury and he punched the locker just over my shoulder. \"Tommy! You're leaving for Sparta and you're not coming back! You're just making this too difficult!\" my voice cracking. His nostrils flared and his striking eyes met mine. I balled my fist and landed it directly into his eye. He inhaled deeply falling back slightly and I took this chance. I tackled him to the ground and started kneeing him in the ribs. He grabbed my arms and pushed them behind my back before wrapping his arms around my waist and flipping me onto my back. He put all his weight on top of me his knees on each side of my ribs. \"I fucking hate you Tommy Riordan!\" I snarled both our sweat and saliva mixing together as we wrestled. I reached up and I dug my nails into his face. \"Fuckin' bitch!\" he barked repeatedly as he blocked my punches and tried to keep me down. I got a free hand and grabbed a clump of brown hair twisting him back before I belted him with an uppercut. He fell back and I scrambled to my feet with him soon following. His nose began to bleed and the cut on my cheek had opened up again, a trail of blood falling from the edge. He didn't hit me once though. We stood there both panting heavily and then he strode over and grabbed my neck between his two huge hands, resting his forehead against mine. I clamped his neck with my hands and squeezed as he was doing with me. Beads of sweat formed and rolled from our faces down our necks. His breath was hot on my face and mine on his. His eyes gazed brutally into mine. \"I hate you Tommy\" I gasped. \"I hate you too\" he wheezed. He suddenly and aggressively clamped his lips on mine out of nowhere. I felt my lips open and I reluctantly allowed his tongue to dart inside my mouth. The only thing that I could hear now was our deep inhales of breath before he shoved me against the lockers with a horrendous bang. I nipped at his plump bottom lip and dug my nails into his neck not relenting from the initial kiss as his hands that were clasped around my neck tightened. We both pulled away but only from the kiss, our foreheads were still pressed tightly together and we held each other in our own death grips. We didn't say anything, for once nothing needed to be said.[Chapter 6] Hey guys! New chapter, hope you guys like it! :D Thanks again to everyone who reads, follows and reviews, would love to know what you guys are thinking about it :D So here we go, lota emotion in this chapter, so enjoy :) Tommy really is an amazing character I love writing him fair play to Tom and the writer, amazing work. Anyway I'll stop now, enjoy :] -Sailor I don't know how long we stood there his dark orb eyes looking between my icy blue pools but someone eventually walked in and interrupted us. Tommy leaned away and got a slightly frightened deer in the headlights look before grabbing his bag and rushing out. \"Tommy…\" I called but he ignored me and rushed out. I suddenly got that all too familiar hollow feeling I usually got when I felt my whole life collapsing around me. I got home and slammed the door. My mother was standing in the kitchen cooking something and got a big bright smile on her face when I walked in. \"Well how did you get on?\" she said her tone changing seeing the blood on my cheek and my cut re opening. \"Not well!\" I yelled throwing myself into chair. And then to make matters worse my skanky sister walked in dressed like a cheap hooker, or how she usually looks in other words. \"You look like crap\" she remarked. \"Thanks because I feel like shit\" I said resting my face on the table. \"Is life not all sweetness and light with that absolute beaut Tommy? Don't tell me you've fucked that up already. Just let him sit there and look a total babe that's what I'd do, he's just a fucking ride! Uh! I could just spread him on a cracker\" \"You know…shockingly this isn't making me feel any better\" I muttered into my sleeve. \"Jamie…ssh\" said my mother obviously knowing I was one more snide comment away from bursting her face wide open. \"What? What's going on?\" she said obviously feeling left out. I got up and grabbed my backpack searching for that flyer I got about the female fight night. Tonight was Friday so it was on tonight and if I won, that 500 dollars could go a long way to get me out of here. \"Do you kids want some dinner?\" \"No\" I mumbled reefing through my bag but I couldn't find it, I must have dropped it. But I remember it said it was beginning at half eleven. \"Ma can I borrow your car tonight?\" \"For what?\" \"I need it to get to this fight night thing that's happening up at the Spearmint Rhino\" \"That strip club? Are you telling me they're letting you strip? You? Look at the state of you\" added my sister. \"I'm not stripping; shut up you skank…Ma there's a fight on there, 500 dollar prize\" \"You're not gonna get hurt are you?\" \"Ma I'm tougher than all the yokes that are gonna be fighting in this\" \"Ok…\" she said not fully convinced \"The keys are hanging up\" \"Thanks Ma\" \"How come I never get to borrow your car Ma?\" \"Because you'll sell it for drugs you junkie fuck\" I snapped closing the door and going upstairs to pack my bag for tonight. I sat into the car and threw my bag in the back seat. By the time I got to strip club, it was about half ten but men were already queuing up to get their seats as close to ring as possible. I grabbed my bag and walked up to the ring, the guys drinking from cans and wolf whistling in my direction. I thought I recognised a few of them. The guy in the ring came over and looked me up and down. \"Don't tell me you want to enter\" he scoffed. \"Yea, why what's wrong with me?\" \"You're a bit…\" \"What you think I don't look good it's just coz I'm wearing baggy clothes\" \"Well show us the goods\" I rolled my eyes and whipped off my hoody which caused more howling and whistling. Seeing the guy's reaction he smiled warmly and nodded. \"Ok you're in!\" I sat in the dingy dressing room surrounded by stick thin, sickly girls who were probably strippers on the side. I taped up my hands and glanced at my face in the mirror. The bruising was nearly healed but I still had a bruise under my eye and my cut on my cheek. They called us from the dressing room and the first fight of the night was underway and as I suspected they were all terrible. Their technique was flawed and all over the shop and basically they just looked like they were having a pillow fight. Although the men at the side of the ring looked like Christmas had come early. I was called up and was up against some yoke called Krystal with a k. I tackled her straight away and climbed on top throwing digs into her face. The guys were on their feet cheering taking a mental photograph for when they come home to jerk off. I fought three women and the last one pulled out seeing the other ones being carried out of the ring unconscious. I was brought into the ring and announced as the winner. Everyone cheered and as I walked out past the crowd into the dressing room while being met with obscene insults and hand gestures. A greasy man with a silk shirt, cigar and gold chain hanging around his neck approached me in the dressing room. \"Hey baby you did great! You coming back next week I'll have no more volunteers if you keep hittin' the way you're hittin'\" he smiled \"But the guys love you! I was talking to a few outside and boy they loved it, we're looking at double the volume of customers next week\" he smiled. I saw the dollar signs appear in his eyes but I just tuned him out. \"Yea, yea, yea can I have my money?\" I said taking my hair down out of my pony tail. \"Of course here ya go\" he said handing me an envelope. I did a quick count before shoving it in my bag. \"So next week my new little foxy boxer\" he said putting his fists and laughing. \"Yea maybe\" I said shoving past him I thought about it as I walked to my car…if I did like five or six fights that'll be more than enough to start life somewhere else and do some fights there until I have a good stash and see where I go from there…but just as I reached into my pocket to get my keys I felt a horrendous pain in the back of my head and I collapsed to the ground. I saw two pairs of feet and heard a voice from behind me. A set of arms picked me up and dragged me across the parking lot and into a van. They threw me up against the side and I saw three sets of eyes glaring down at me. \"So you got your body guard to tune Peter up?\" \"I swear I didn't know what he was going to do!\" But then I felt a sharp stinging sensation in my eyes as they sprayed what I think was pepper spray in my eyes. I felt like I was blind and opening my eyes was impossible. \"I swear\" I whimpered, my tough exterior now in shatters \"I didn't know he was going to do anything, he did it off his own bat!\" \"Where is he?\" I took a deep breath ready to give them precise directions to where Tommy trains but then something stopped me. \"I don't know…\" \"Yea you do\" \"I don't I swear I would tell you if I did! There's no way I'd put myself in this position if I knew where he was!\" I knew they were going to beat me to a bloody pulp it was only a matter of time. But then out of nowhere a pain like I've never experienced before came right under my breast. One of them had dug a knife into my ribs. \"Are you sure you don't know where he is?\" \"No! No! I don't…I think he's left. He has a fucked up relationship with his pop so the last I heard he was leaving to fight in Vegas\" I panted, every breath feeling like my last. The pain was just indescribable. I felt the knife being twisted as they continued to interrogate me. \"You know something!\" one of them roared clearly getting frustrated that I wasn't giving up Tommy. \"I swear if I knew I would tell you\" I cried, the pain was just unbearable. \"Alright…fuck her out, she knows nothing.\" one of them grunted. I felt the knife being ripped out and I was thrown out of the van onto the cold concrete the only thing visible being the blinding light of the street lamp above. \"Our regards from Peter\" they sniggered as the van door slammed and they drove away. I felt warm liquid running out of me onto the ground and knew I was going to die. Here in the parking lot of a strip club, with nothing to my name and no legacy. Then I blacked out. Then I heard myself thinking. Wait? I'm alive? Where am I? I moved my head from side to side and my eyes opened very slowly, everything a blurry haze. I blinked a few times and my vision became a bit clearer. My mother was sitting beside and immediately started fusing once I woke up. She had about six nurses and doctors in who said it was fine, just don't get me excited or let me talk too much because I basically only had one lung working right now. \"I can't believe someone did this\" she wept. \"Ma, please this isn't helping\" I croaked. \"I should have never let you go to that fight that night\" \"Ma\" I said trying to assert some authority but it was too painful. \"Who did it?\" \"Does that matter?\" I coughed slightly. \"Yes it does! You nearly died\" she sobbed. \"God really I didn't know that…\" I felt my side ache so I decided to stop talking altogether. \"You were out for 2 weeks honey\" she choked out. \"2 weeks? Fuck…\" was all I managed to muster. \"You lost so much blood it was only when a group of guys who were at the fight saw you and called an ambulance…Tommy was here as soon as he heard\" I knew it was only a matter of time before she mentioned him. \"What? How'd he hear?\" \"I told his father\" \"Ma! What are you doing still meddling in my life?\" \"He was very concerned; he stayed here for over a week, never leaving the room. He asks the nurses to clear it with him before they let any visitors in. Asked who they were, what relation they were to you, specified only family allowed in, questioned them before they came in to prove they were who they said they were and insisted he stayed in the room with you while they visited. He had to tell them he was your husband so they'd meet his demands\" she laughed slightly. \"Yea must have got a pain in his arse coz he's not here now is he?\" I sneered. \"His father got concerned he wasn't training enough for that big fight thing he's involved in but he didn't seem too concerned\" \"Sparta…\" then it hit me Sparta was this week. Just as I was having that epiphany, a knock came on the door. It was Tommy. \"Mrs Coonan would you mind if I talk to Erika alone?\" he said in the usual super polite manner he uses with my mother. \"No problem son\" she said getting up. She patted him on the shoulder as she met him at the door and waited outside. Tommy came in and sat down, the same sullen exterior, except there was a twitch of vulnerability when he placed his hand over his mouth like he couldn't believe what he was seeing. \"You're awake\" he sighed. \"What happened?\" \"What's it to you?\" His lip twitched but I was too tired to be any more sarcastic so I sighed heavily and began telling him what happened. \"Then they bundled me into a van, sprayed pepper spray in my eyes, interrogated me then stabbed me in the ribs\" \"Interrogating you about what?\" \"They…they wanted to know where you were\" \"And why didn't you tell him?! They would have let you go!\" he barked. \"I didn't know where you were…I don't know where you live\" \"That's bullshit Erika you could have told them anything and you should have they would have let you go!\" \"What and then they'd come after you!\" I said as loud as I could but the pain in my side was excruciating. \"Yea and?\" \"Well excuse me for being a selfish bitch and sparing you! These guys are dangerous Tommy!\" \"I know but I've dealt with worse than those scumbags…I was in the marines after all…\" \"You were?\" \"Erika…\" he said grabbing my hand \"You should have told them\" I got a weird feeling when he held my hand; he had never done it before… \"Yea well I wasn't about to give you up to them…shouldn't you be at the gym?\" \"I told my pop I was at the yard lifting tyres…\" he said his eyes hitting me dead. \"I'm not going to Sparta\" \"What?\" I said nearly choking on my own breath. \"I know what's important…\" \"Yea, that 5 million dollars!\" \"Yes…there were people who I would have liked to benefit from that money…but at some point in time you've got to look to the future and not remain trapped in the past…\" Sometimes I have no idea where the shit he spouts comes from. \"Tommy you are going to Sparta\" \"Then I'm taking you to Sparta with me\" he said squeezing my hand so hard I could feel my IV moving in my veins. \"Would ya fuck off I have one good lung and can barely move\" I laughed, well what passed for my laugh now. \"Well then I'm staying here\" \"That's just stupid Tommy\" \"Those bastards stabbed you\" \"Do you not think I know that? How is you staying here not competing in Sparta gonna help? Tommy…this doesn't sound like you at all\" He let his head drop slightly and I just about heard what he said. \"You do something to me kid…\" But just as quick as he opened up not too loud to let me know but still, he clamped up again. \"You're a fucking fool not telling them where I was\" \"Tommy\" I said sitting up. I knew there was only one way to convince him to go. I had to let my guard down. Then what my mother said finally hit me about us being cut from the same cloth… He looked up and I placed my hand over his own already clasped on my other hand. \"I promise if you come back I will be here waiting for you\" Now I wasn't sure if I even believed my own words but I said it anyway to make sure he did what was best for him…I think that was the first thing I did something that benefitted someone else that didn't indirectly help myself in any way. \"Tommy I need you to go to Sparta…\" \"And you'll be here?\" There it was, doubt. Clearly we were more alike than I thought, he didn't even believe me. \"Yes I will\" He leaned over and kissed me gently and something inside began to hurt and it wasn't my lung. \"I am sorry Erika…you were right when you said what would happen when I leave you…if I could take you to Sparta with me I would…but I promise I won't leave you again\" he said before walking out. For some reason I didn't totally trust what he said because as much as I liked to believe he would come back for me when he hit the big time…I had a feeling he wouldn't, maybe because he was too like me and I didn't expect to still be here when he arrived back.[Chapter 7] Hey guys! Thanks to everyone who is still reading, reviewing and adding to faves and the people who added me to their fave author and author subscription. I love you all! -Sailor The doctor told me I would make a full recovery except if I was running in cold, dense air like early in the morning I wouldn't be able to run very far without a sharp pain racing through my lung. So that was the end of my 5a.m runs now. I also wasn't going to be able to work out as long as I used to and was going to have a horrible scar. It wasn't so much the physical scar but the mental scar. \"Doc, I'm finding myself waking up at night struggling to breath. And when I put my hand over my lung when I wake up with shock I can't feel myself breath, I can't feel it…it's like I'm dead\" \"Well…the mind has a way of playing tricks.\" I looked past him and saw the coverage of Sparta was starting. \"You think I'm imagining it?\" \"No…\" he said sitting down on the edge of the bed. \"Your body has experienced a trauma, a serious trauma Erika. It needs to recover itself and that takes time, both physically and mentally. Body and mind are connected\" he said pointing between his head and heart. \"When can I go home?\" \"Well making sure you stay at home you can leave tomorrow. You've just got to keep up the antibiotics to ensure there's no infection\" \"Ok thank god because I actually hate staying here\" \"Well as long as you keep up the medication and stay at home on bed rest and come back for regular check-ups you should be fine\" he smiled before leaving the room. For the rest of the day I watched the Sparta coverage they talked to every contender and did profiles on each. The war on the shore had officially started. But Tommy was nowhere to be seen. No press conference, no pictures nothing. But that was typical Tommy. I was awoken that night to my phone buzzing loudly and I immediately placed my hand over my chest and couldn't feel anything but the panic subsided as I realised I was still alive. I picked up the phone and glanced at the screen, the light in the dark blinding me. I answered it and croaked some inaudible words into the phone. \"Erika?\" I heard on the other end, a very timid voice but familiar. \"Tommy?\" I whispered sitting up in the bed seeing the shadow of a nurse walk by the door. They were like Nazi's in this ward when it came to phones. \"Erika…\" \"What is it Tommy?\" \"Erika…I was just with…on the beach…and I don't know…\" he choked out his breath catching in his throat. Then I heard a growl come from his chest…and then the line went dead. I rang the number back straight away but it just rang out. The next day I was discharged and brought straight home by my mother who had everything set up for me. I immediately put on Sparta and saw the first fights were starting. I was watching for about an hour when I heard him call Tommy's name and I felt my stomach drop. A camera panned in front of him as he walked out. No music, no advertisement on his clothes just a black hoody. He pulled it off him when he got to the ring and they checked him, his mouth, behind his ears and everything while the commentator mentioned how little they knew about him. \"This guy just seemed to appear out of nowhere! He was a YouTube sensation after his fight with Mad Dog and that's how he seemed to start\" \"I know but did you see that fight? Tommy Riordan decked that guy in minutes! And you should see him train! Amazing!\" \"Yea but you gotta remember the bag doesn't hit back\" The camera panned to his opponent and then out to a woman beside the ring. \"And that's his wife there, as we've seen there's no one here for Tommy at all. This guy just seems to survive by himself\" \"A lone wolf\" the other laughed. \"Yea exactly and I think we're about to see how the lone wolf's reacts to all these people\" \"Look at that Tommy has no one there…\" remarked my mother folding a blanket. \"Mother\" I snapped. \"This guy just looks ready to destroy anything that gets in his way\" \"Yea but I still think he's a one shot guy, he'll be shown for what he is as soon as he steps in the ring\" \"Ah I think you're being a bit unfair\" laughed the commentator. \"Well we'll see how your boy fairs now\" he said as the cage door closed and the lights flashed. Something in my stomach dropped as the door locked. I tried to fight the feelings that were rising inside me for Tommy. I hated myself for letting him get under my skin like this especially since I know for certain I haven't been allowed under his skin like that. He looked pumped, his nostrils flared, the film of sweat that draped all over his body defined his muscles especially his traps. They caught the light and as much as I didn't want to admit it, he looked unreal. \"Let's go to war!\" shouted the ref and the match started. The first couple of seconds, they were scoping each other out, lightly tipping off each other and then out of nowhere Tommy struck one fatal blow and his opponents head fell back like a rag doll and he collapsed cold on the mat. The commentators were nearly out of their seats and the crowd were on their feet. He lay motionless on the mat as the ref went over and slapped his face getting no response. Tommy paced around like a caged animal reaching into his mouth and whipping out his gum shield, his wild animalistic eyes turning around boring into his opponent's lifeless body. He breathed in deep through his nose before throwing the cage door open ignoring the cheers, screams, praises and protest from the referee. He stormed out of the arena and was gone. It was over in minutes. I couldn't believe it; he had knocked him out with one blow. Clearly this wasn't the Tommy that had rang me the other night, this man was determined in what he wanted, not the emotionally unstable young man who couldn't even explain his own feelings to me on the phone. \"Did Tommy just knock him out?\" my mother said clearly a few minutes behind everyone else. \"Yea…\" I said not really sure what I had just watched. The commentators were rendered speechless. To be fair I don't think anyone saw that coming. The next match started and everyone focused on that but I could tell that Tommy's amazing performance was glued in everyone's mind. \"Now I didn't think he was a violent man like that\" my mother said her voice visibly shocked. \"What? He's a fighter\" \"I know but whenever I have dealings with him he's not like that at all…\" \"Yea well you don't know what's going on inside someone's head\" \"That's true…I suppose all that business with his brother…\" \"What?\" I said turning down the television. \"His brother\" she said as if I'm supposed to know what she was talking about. \"You're gonna have to give me more than that\" \"His brother, they don't talk, goes back to years ago…he's actually fighting in this as well\" \"What? How do you know this?\" I snapped. \"His father told me\" \"And you decided to keep it to yourself?!\" \"I thought you wouldn't care…\" she said sarcastically. But then something else bothered me about what she said. \"Wait…did you say his brother is fighting in this? There's no other Riordan in this\" \"His brother is Conlon\" \"Then who's Riordan?\" \"That's his mother's name…\" she said softly. \"O…but why doesn't he speak to his brother?\" \"Well…\" but then she closed up. \"I shouldn't be telling you this\" she said getting up. \"Why not? Ma, I think I should know!\" I said the frustration getting to me. \"No, it's Tommy's business\" she said closing the door. \"If you want to know why don't you ask him?\" I heard her muffled voice say from kitchen. \"You could just tell me\" I snipped. That phone call still troubled me though, it shouldn't and it annoyed me that it did but I wasn't about to put myself out at all, especially with my gammy lung and especially for Tommy. He may be digging under my skin but I still had to think about number one. But then I got that pain, that pain I got when he kissed me, that pain I got when Tommy was sneaking into my mind and switching my whole ethos around. I put my hand over my chest and felt my heart beat slowly and dimly. I took a breath and felt only one side of my chest rise. I took another deep breath trying to dull the pain but it wouldn't go away. \"Tommy Riordan, the man, the myth, the machine!\" spoke the commentator as he matched up who Tommy was up against next. I breathed in slowly but felt nothing on my right side. \"Fuckin' Tommy Riordan\" I sighed heavily trying to stop the pain. Sooner I get out of here, the better.[Chapter 8] Hey guys! Kinda short chapter but hope you enjoy it :) Update will be soon don't worry :D Thanks to all my readers and reviewers. Also just on a side note if anyone has watched 'The Take' it's a mini series Tom Hardy starred in and there's no category for it here so it's under misc TV shows so it's kinda impossible to find so if anyone is looking for 'The Take' fanfiction I have written one so check it out if you're so inclined :) Thanks guys! -Sailor I sat for the rest of the day watching Sparta…well actually I tell a lie. I sat in the chair, Tommy running through my mind while Sparta was just background noise. Then I decided to switch the station, but just to sports news to see what else was going in other sports but Sparta was breaking news, except it wasn't about any fight. A soldier appeared and I only caught the end when he said \"he saved my life, me and everyone else in that tank…\" Then a very blurry armature video appeared of a solider literally pulling the door off a sinking tank, it was Tommy. I turned the TV up full volume just in case I missed something. \"So there you have it, Tommy Riordan, the war hero! Another line to the rich tapestry that is Tommy Riordan!\" exclaimed the presenter. \"The man literally pulled a door off a tank!\" I couldn't believe it. The video stopped just as it zoomed in on Tommy pulling the soldiers out. He looked different…he looked like the guy who called me the other night, lost. My knee shook, I went totally numb and a feeling I have never had before taking over me. I wasn't even listening to what was going on and then before it even registered with me I was picking up my house phone from the hallway and dialling the number for the hotel the fighters were staying at. Tommy really was a complex man of many layers and as much as I hated to admit to myself I had definitely fallen for him, even if he didn't feel the same way. \"Hello Round Hall Hotel, how may I help you?\" \"I'm trying to get in contact with someone, could you connect me to the Riordan's room?\" \"I'm sorry what did you say your name was?\" \"Erika I'm Tommy's…niece\" I said clenching my eyes avoiding the obvious answer to that. \"Ok…I have no Riordan's…\" she said suddenly more suspicious of my obviously false family connection. \"O it might under my a different name…Conlon\" \"Ok…I have two Conlon's. Paddy and Brendan…which is it you wanted to be connected to?\" I suppose there's no point contacting his brother I doubt he'd be with him. \"Eh Paddy, thanks\" The line went silent and then the ring startled me slightly. After a few rings I was going to hang up when a raspy voice answered. \"Hello?\" \"Hello is that Paddy?\" \"Yes…who's this?\" \"This is Erika you know Tommy's friend from the gym?\" \"O yes Erika, how are you? How's your mother?\" \"We're good thanks, listen is Tommy there?\" I said not really wanting to get into small talk with his dad. \"No he's not\" he sighed. \"He's in the casino…it's like I don't know him anymore…he's a different boy…\" he said. He sounded like he was on the verge of tears. I honestly didn't know what to say to be honest, what do you say? \"Mr Conlon I really need to talk to Tommy\" I choked out. \"I know but God knows when he'll be back, what's so urgent about it?\" \"Well he rang me the other night and he didn't say anything just said he was out on the beach and then he hung up I tried to ring him back but nothing…\" \"O…\" he said taking a different tone. \"That would have been when he met up with his brother\" \"What?\" I said my throat suddenly going dry. Why would he call me after talking to his brother, he never even mentioned he had a brother to me. \"Yea they had words…I apologised to both of them but they were having none of it. Don't think they can forgive their old pop to be honest\" \"Mr Conlon, I need to speak to him\" I said not accepting the fact I wasn't able to talk to him. I don't even know what I would say but I figured I would know it when I heard his voice. \"I know that kid but he's not here…I'm going to go and see him in the Casino do you want me to give him a message?\" I thought for a moment. \"No there's no message, thanks Mr Conlon\" I said before hanging up. Ok clearly something in the universe was there to keep me and Tommy apart. I went into the kitchen and sat down my mother jabbering about something. \"Ma…Tommy is a war hero\" I said cutting across her. I could barely believe it myself. \"What?\" \"He was in the marines…he saw a tank sinking with soldiers trapped inside and he pulled the door off and saved him\" \"Wow…so he is a good one after all\" she smirked. \"Ma…I need to talk to him but he's not in his hotel room…\" \"When's his next fight?\" \"Tomorrow\" \"What are you gonna do?\" \"I don't know…I don't even know what I'm feeling right now\" \"You've realised Tommy is everything that you've ever wanted and you're scared in case he doesn't feel the same way\" \"Well…what if he doesn't? I mean he rang me the other night, babbled something and then hung up\" \"What did he ring for?\" \"I don't know, his dad said it just after he had words with his brother…he sounded upset\" \"So he has a family crisis and out of everyone he rings you…does that sound odd to you?\" she smiled. \"I don't know…\" I mumbled. She would just be insufferable if she knew she was right. \"Why don't you go out to him?\" \"What?\" \"Go out to Atlantic City and see him!\" she urged. \"No, I won't be doing that\" \"Why?\" \"Because first of all I can't afford it\" \"I'll pay for it!\" \"No Ma…\" \"Erika, this is one of the only times I will push you to take my money but I seriously think you need to talk to Tommy. He's a complex man and you need to tell him clearly\" \"Ma, he'll probably just laugh right in my face\" \"He won't! And he needs you now more than ever especially with all that business with his brother. He needs support, he needs you at the edge of that ring cheering him on he's got no one!\" \"I don't…\" \"And he's so lovely and sweet\" she added in just at the end. \"I can't go to Atlantic City…\" \"Yes you can!\" she said reaching into her purse that lay on the window sill, plucking out her credit card.[Chapter 9] Hello everyone! Hope you all had a good Christmas! :D Thank you for all the lovely reviews and I am sorry this has taken a while, I'll try not to leave it so long again :) I also have a new Lawless fic if anyone wants to check it out, just thought I'd give it a mention so here we go and please leave a review I do love reading them :) I love you all! xoxo -Sailor Three hours later I arrived in Atlantic City. My stomach didn't settle through the whole flight. My gym bag hung off my shoulder as I marched through the airport outside to the taxi rank. I flung my bag into the back of the cab and sat in. My stomach had a constant dull ache which I tried to ignore. \"Round hall hotel\" I said before he even asked. \"Oh, you with one of those fighters?\" \"I suppose you could say that…\" I said staring out the window. \"Big guys they are\" he said flicking his indicator. \"Yea they are\" \"Bringing a lot of business to the city\" \"Yea…\" I said not really wanting to talk to him. If I'm being honest, I felt so sick with worry that I couldn't bring myself to form words. It felt like if I said too much I would actually puke everywhere. When we pulled up outside the hotel, I threw the money at him and grabbed my bag. I raced into reception throwing my bag on the floor. \"Paddy Conlon\" I panted. \"I'm sorry who are you?\" \"I'm Tommy's sister…and I really need to see him it's a family emergency\" \"Oh ok…\" she said clearly frazzled by my apparent panic. \"Room 207\" she said sliding a spare key over the desk to me. I grabbed the key along with my bag and ran to the lift. When I got to the door I stopped dead in my tracks. What was I going to do? Go in and just tell him I never wanted to be without him again? That was a stupid plan…I put the key card in the door and saw the green button allowing me to enter. I pushed the door open but saw or heard no one. I closed it gently and looked around. I saw the living room was messy strewn with empty liquor bottles, couch cushions thrown around, tables knocked over…it definitely looked like Tommy's room. I looked into the bedroom and found him. He was lying on the bed, his dad lying in his arms looking like he was unconscious. Tommy had his arms wrapped around him holding him tightly to his chest. His eyes looked up and stared directly at me. \"Erika…\" \"Tommy\" \"What are you doing here?\" he said his clutch on his father not relenting. \"Tommy I had to see you…after you called me that night I just couldn't stop thinking about you…what happened to your dad?\" \"Relapse…\" Tommy folded his father's arms and laid him fully down getting up and coming towards me. \"I saw your video…of you in Iraq…\" I said quietly as he led me out of the room. \"Yea…it was nothing\" \"What? You saved those men's lives! You're a war hero\" He simply shrugged and sat on the sofa. I sat next to him putting my hand gently on his knee. \"How can you shrug that off? You are an amazing human being!\" \"I was on my way home after deserting my company…does that scream war hero to you?\" I wasn't expecting that I must admit. \"But still Tommy, if you weren't walking by at that time those men would have died! You saved their lives and you can't just shrug that off\" \"Well how come I can then?\" \"Tommy, how can you not see how amazing you are for doing that?\" \"Because I couldn't save the one person who mattered the most to me, he died out there…\" he said, his voice choking slightly. I didn't know what to say to that to be honest, I didn't want to ask because it was clear he didn't want to talk about it, but before I got a chance to reply he spoke again. \"I can't believe you're here…\" he said shaking his head. \"I needed to see you…you…you mean a lot to me\" I whispered quietly. So quietly I don't think he even heard me because he just gazed out in front of him like he wasn't listening. So I tried a different approach. I felt like I couldn't come out and directly say what was in my head so I had to go a roundabout way of saying it. \"I had to come and see you. My mother mentioned your brother…\" His head suddenly shot up, his glassy eyes gazing at me. \"What?\" \"No she didn't tell me anything…she just mentioned it and I thought you might need someone in the crowd to support you\" I figured it wasn't my place to tell him that it was actually his dad that told me that he had met up with his brother. \"I don't need any support\" he sniffed. \"Tommy…\" He pushed my hand off his knee and stiffened up. \"I don't need to rely on anyone!\" \"I just thought…maybe you'd like to see someone at the side of the ring cheering you on\" His eyes hit mine as I babbled on but I felt him slipping away. \"I mean I understand what it's like to have problems with siblings…\" \"Erika, I'm sorry I didn't mean to ring you that night if this is what you're basing this on\" he coughed. \"What? But you rang me…you said my name\" \"I know but it was a moment of weakness…one which I soon got over\" I felt like someone had just shot me in the chest from close range. \"Tommy…please…\" I said trying to calm myself down. My mother's words echoed in my head and I tried not to lose my temper so easily. \"I'm sorry…you've wasted a trip here if you think that I'm that weak, I'm anything but that\" \"But you sounded so lost and…I figured I'd come here and be there for you, we can support each other…it wasn't weakness…Tommy I don't think you're getting what I'm trying to say\" I said holding back my hurt and anger, trying to explain my feelings but clearly not doing a very good job. He looked over at me, his eyes wild with anger and mistrust. \"I'm not lost; I know exactly what I'm here to do. I don't need anyone\" he sneered But then I couldn't hold it in any longer, I lost it. \"Well fuck you Tommy!\" I roared standing up. \"You like to strut around thinking you're this lion, this machine that doesn't need anyone and you know what? For a long time I was the exact same…but then you came into my life and I started to question that!\" I choked out, trying not to show my emotion. His expression didn't change, like it never did when I'd talk to him before. He just stood there looking through me like I wasn't even there. \"But now I'm starting to see…when you said you were gonna come back for me, you didn't mean it did you? Somewhere inside me I knew you wouldn't because you're too like me…but I stupidly listened to other people and thought you would! That you actually cared about me!\" I screamed. \"Erika…I just…I don't…I can't…\" he started but his mouth just opened like he couldn't put into words what he was trying to say, but there was no stopping me. \"Well you can go and fuck yourself\" I said heading for the door but I turned around to say one last thing. \"And when you came to see me in the hospital and told me you were never going to leave me again…well that was clearly bullshit because here I am…I came to be with you and you just push me away, well that's fine. As long as we're both being honest here…I hate you Tommy!\" I slammed the door and ran to the elevator, slid down to the ground and burst into tears as the doors closed over slowly. I sat in the bar charging drinks to my mother's credit card, tears rolling down my face, thinking about what had just happened between me and Tommy. I can't believe I listened to my mother and came here. What did I think I was actually going to achieve? That Tommy and I would just ride off into the sunset? We were too messed up in the head for that. I don't know…and as much as I hated to admit it to myself, my feelings for Tommy were never stronger, but I wasn't about to admit that to him now, especially after what he told me. I was so depressing even the bar man didn't want to talk to me, which was understandable. A guy came in and sat beside me ordering a coke and asked if he could use the phone. I glanced at him, my drunken eyes trying to focus. He's a fighter…I think. After he was done with his phone call, he glanced at me sideways before sipping his coke. \"Do they let women fight in this thing?\" he asked in a thick accent. \"What?\" I slurred. \"You look like you've been shown a thing or two\" \"Yea…don't ask…\" I said chugging my whiskey and asking for another. \"Ah I'm intrigued now\" He had a slight cut on his cheek and a stupid grin which just pissed me off even more. \"What's your deal?\" \"Nothin' just wondering what your story is…you're built like a fighter but you look as emotionally stable as a bag of rats in a burning meth lab\" \"Thanks\" \"Guy problems?\" \"You don't know the half of it\" I turned to him in my drunken state and he seemed to have an air of charm about him. \"Erika\" I said holding out my hand. \"Brendan Conlon\" he smiled back. Something inside me jumped slightly and I ordered another for me and a drink for Tommy's brother. This was going to be an interesting conversation.[Chapter 10] Hello everyone and happy new year! :D Thanks to everyone who is reading and reviewing I love all of you! You all rock! So here we go new chapter hope you like it and stick a review on here if you'd like, I love knowing what you guys think :) xoxo -Sailor \"So are you fighting in this?\" I said feeling my brain rattle around my head. I really should slow down on the whiskey, especially since I wanted to remember this conversation. \"Yea sure am…just rang my wife there, she doesn't really approve\" \"Women\" I snorted. \"Oh boy I know\" he laughed. \"Like we need the money, badly\" he said sipping his drink. \"Really? You know money isn't everything…\" I sniffed. \"Ah I know that…but the bank is on the brink of taking our house so that money would go a long way\" I gulped more of my whiskey preparing myself for his tale of woe. \"Your family mean a lot to you?\" \"The world\" he said turning his head to me. \"Wonder what that's like…\" \"You and your family don't get on?\" \"Ah my mam's alright, it's my sister\" I said emphasising sister watched as his ears pricked up. \"Ah siblings never get on…\" \"You got brothers or sisters?\" He looked into his glass swishing what was left of his coke while his whiskey sat waiting for him. The silence was deafening for what seemed like forever. \"Yea, I got a brother\" he said quietly. \"Oh…you two not get on?\" I said playing as stupid as I could which was easy enough considering I was half cut. \"Unfortunately not…he's a complex guy…seen a lota shit…and our dad wasn't a great guy either, that didn't help Tommy. And then I suppose I didn't help…\" \"Why, what did you do?\" He looked at me with a sad smirk. \"You don't really wanna hear about this, do you?\" I shrugged my shoulders pretending I wasn't dying inside wanting to know what he was about to say. \"If you wanna talk about it\" \"Well to cut it long story short, when Tommy left with my ma…I was meant to meet them there but I had already started a life for myself and I never went…\" \"Why'd they leave?\" \"My old man, well he wasn't good to my ma. He used to beat her up and eventually Tommy had enough…\" \"So you and him don't talk?\" \"No, well I haven't seen him in years, that was until I found him fighting here…shockingly he still hasn't forgiven me\" \"What happened?\" \"Well there's one thing you gotta understand about Tommy…\" I involuntarily leaned in a bit closer to him. \"He doesn't say a lot…\" Duh. \"But he thinks a lot about stuff and when he talks, his words can cut through you like razors…because it's all built up in his head for so long that when he spits it out, it's like acid\" I already knew that, but at least it wasn't just me he was like that with. \"And when he left, I never got to see him or mam again, well he never got over that and then it all came out when I met him the other night…told me I was full of shit and I was no brother of his\" I could tell this was paining him, if only Tommy knew how much pain he caused. I reached over and put my hand on his shoulder, more out of sympathy than anything else. He wasn't the best looking son out of them, sure was ugly but I felt bad for the guy. \"Aw Brendan…that's too bad, I'm sorry to hear that\" \"I still love him…he's my brother after all\" \"Yea I mean, you never stop loving them, they're family\" I slurred. \"Exactly…well I've told you my problems, it's your turn\" \"Ah not much to tell, I've travelled to be with a man who I thought felt the same…and then he basically tells me I've been imagining it…\" \"Well are you sure you didn't imagine it?\" \"No he called me…and well things were always frosty between us…but I thought we had made a break through. I know I haven't always been the easiest person so get on with but I figured if I softened up he would too, how wrong I was\" I said taking another sip. \"Maybe you too aren't meant for each other\" \"Yea you're probably right\" \"Is he fightin' in this?\" I nodded swishing the alcohol around my mouth, feeling it hit the back of my throat. \"What's his name?\" \"Ah I can't tell you that\" I laughed. \"Ok, I understand that considering I might be fighting him\" he laughed. \"Yea…that's it exactly. When I was in hospital he told me he was never going to leave me alone he actually told me he was going to take me to Sparta with him and then with the other side of his mouth he's telling me everything I based my feelings on is wrong…I don't know, his mood swings are really starting to give me whiplash\" \"Well speaking as a guy…he sounds like a prick\" \"That he is\" I sighed. \"So what you came here to tell him you love him?\" \"Well not in so many words…you don't understand what it's like between us…we're not good at expressing our…feelings so to speak\" \"Ha! That sounds familiar\" \"What?\" I said realising I had said too much. \"Ah nothin' just sounds a bit like Tommy\" \"Well, all men are like that\" \"I tell my wife I love her everyday\" \"That's different\" \"How?\" \"She's your wife\" I snipped taking a long drink. He shook his head clearly not seeing my connection. \"You got through that awkward phase…\" \"I don't ever remember what you described happening to me and my wife\" \"Well…actually you know what, never mind. Can I have two more whiskeys please? You want anything?\" I said turning to him. \"Eh, no I'm good\" he said. \"Well I don't intend to return home sober\" \"You leaving today?\" \"Yup\" \"When'd you get here?\" \"Today\" \"So your boy said all this to you when you first arrived?\" I nodded and gulped my whiskey. \"But you seem like a nice girl, wonder what his deal is\" \"Beats me, I know how hard it is for him to open up but I would have been there but instead…he just lost the plot. I don't know maybe it's for the best. When he reaches the big time, he might meet some girl who is right for him\" \"Would you not even stay until the end of the tournament? See how he gets on?\" I looked at him and something inside my head whispered I should stay. \"Ah I don't know\" I said starting on my second whiskey I had just ordered. I could feel my lips going numb with the alcohol and my eyes droop over. \"I'm sure he would appreciate you staying at least until the end, who knows might change his mind\" \"Ha! Nothing is gonna change Tommy's mind\" I burped. But me of course being absolutely hammered, what I had just said only registered with me after a few seconds. \"Oops\" I said as I saw his expression change drastically. \"Did you say Tommy?\" \"Nope\" \"You did!\" \"I didn't! I just said it coz you…you said it\" I slurred. \"Tommy has a girl, I can't believe it!\" \"Well if he does, it ain't me\" \"I can't believe this...and he's being a total prick to you?\" \"Yup, so I'm heading home\" I said downing my drink and picking myself up off the stool. \"What? No you can't give up on Tommy\" \"Excuse me?\" \"Tommy needs someone like you in his life\" If someone says that to me one more time… \"No he doesn't! Have you not been listening to what I've been saying?\" \"I know, I know…but no you can't leave!\" he said grabbing my shoulders holding me in place. \"Tommy needs a woman like you in his life\" \"Eh you don't even know me\" \"No but since I've been talking to you, I know…I just know you are what Tommy needs\" \"Well what do you want me to do about it? I can't do anything if he won't talk to me! He just keeps brushing me off and pushing me away! So I'm going home!\" I shouted reaching down for my bag but my hand clasped nothing but air. \"Fuck! I left my bag in his fucking room!\" I saw a grin appear on his face and I was just about ready to slap it right off his face. \"Well you better go back up and get it\" \"I'll just leave it\" I sneered into his face. He held me in place, his eyes getting a glaze over them. \"Let me go!\" He grabbed me by my shoulders and looked into my eyes. \"No, go on…you know what to do…you know where his room is\" I felt a tear roll down my face and I stopped struggling against him. I mustered up all my strength and pushed him one last time causing him to fall back against the bar. I stormed past him and out into the lobby and out into the evening sun. A warm wind blew past my face drying my cheeks as I waited for a taxi to arrive from the rank. I hated Tommy and I hated Tommy's family.[Chapter 11] Hello everyone!

I walked back into the hotel but avoided the bar heading to elevator and pressing the button. This was the last thing I wanted to do, but I had to. I went to the door and knocked three times. In the heat of the moment I left the key card on the table. No one answered so I knocked again. \"Who is it?\" I heard Tommy grumble from the other side of the door. \"It's me, let me in or throw my bag out to me\" I snapped. \"Why should I?\" he snapped back. I growled loudly, took a few steps back and kicked the door. I was in no mood for this. The lock snapped instantly and the door swung open. Tommy was sitting on the couch looking beyond me like I had just quietly stepped in. I saw my bag on the ground under his legs that were resting on the coffee table. I stormed over and went to grab it but he sprung up and pulled it behind his back. \"Give me my fucking bag\" I growled. \"No! We…we have to talk\" he said staring at the ground. \"Oh now you want to talk?! Ok talk\" I shouted feeling my gamy lung starting to hurt. Except he just stood there, like he always does with that stupid look of total disinterest as if he was waiting for me to say something. But I wasn't about to be the first to talk, I already said my piece. \"Erika…you have to understand…\" He took in a deep breath and I heard it catch in his throat like he was about to say something but stopped. \"Well?\" I snapped crossing my arms. \"You have to understand…I find it quite hard to explain my feelings…\" \"No, are you serious?\" I snipped. \"Will you just shut up and let me talk?!\" he sighed angrily. \"Oh I'm sorry, am I acting like a total prick?\" \"Yes you are\" he sneered through gritted teeth. \"Well you would know\" His nostrils flared and he threw down my bag, stormed over and grabbed my shoulders, pushing me against the wall. \"If I didn't love you so much, I would have thrown you and your shit out on the street long time ago!\" he growled. My whole face dropped and what he had just said registered with him. \"What?\" I wheezed. \"What?\" he responded in a tone that was just as shocked as mine. \"What did you just say?\" His eyes looked down at the ground, then back up to mine, then every which way except at me. \"Tommy…\" But his lips cut me off mid-sentence, forceful and focused. I grabbed his face clutching him closer to me as I kissed him just as forcefully. He broke away, his eyes still clenched, tears forming in the corners. He bit his lip slightly before kissing me again, lightly this time, his lips just brushing off mine. \"So what are you gonna seize up on me now?\" I whispered, running my fingers through his hair. \"I'm trying not to…but it's hard. It's my natural instinct…I've been like this for years\" I nodded and didn't say anything. Now was not the time for a sarcastic comment. It was like hunting deer, you have to be quiet and take your time, no sudden movements or you'll spook him and he'll run, never to return. \"Tommy I understand, but you have to let someone in, you can't push everyone away as much as you want to… I only recently learned that lesson myself\" Tommy's eyes met mine and I saw that look, the look that went with his voice that night on the phone. He looked lost. \"My poor Tommy\" I whispered as my fingers ran down the back of his head to his neck. I watched as a tear escaped his eye and ran down his cheek. I pulled him into a rough hug, holding him close as if I was trying to stop him from shattering into a million pieces. \"Erika, are you gonna stay for the fight?\" he whispered. \"Do you want me to stay?\" He didn't say anything, all I could feel was his body moving up and down as he took in a deep breath. I brought my hands up rubbing his back before resting on his traps. I needed him to say it. Call it selfish or whatever, but I needed to hear him tell me he needed me. That would be the breakthrough…and I could admit that I needed him just as much. I wasn't about to say it first, it's a sign of weakness. But that right there, that was our problem…we couldn't even admit that to ourselves. His breath shakily snaked past my ear, but nothing came after it. I pushed him off me and looked into his eyes. His stare looked up from the ground and met mine but he still remained quiet. \"Do you need me to stay?\" \"No…I don't need anyone\" he whispered. \"Well then I'm not going to stay then\" \"Why?\" \"Because there's no point in me being here if you don't need me\" I snipped. \"Erika…\" \"No, you've given me the cold shoulder for too long…and I know if I stay I'm gonna be in for it again. It's who you are and until you can admit that you want me here…I should go home. I'm not the kind of girl who will just take shit 99% of the time for that 1% of love and happiness\" I said taking my bag off the floor. \"Where are you going?\" he mumbled. \"Home\" \"But what about what you said…that I mean a lot to you\" \"You do Tommy…but I'm not willing to put myself through all this. I've got enough shit going on in my life\" \"You're not going back\" he said grabbing my bag. \"Why not?\" \"Because…because what about Peter?\" \"Well that's a chance I'm gonna have to take…bye Tommy\" I said opening the door. But then he pulled my arm back and pulled me into him kissing me deeply but I pushed him away. \"No, Tommy that isn't going to make everything better all the time!\" He backed away slightly looking at the ground, his hand against his lip. \"So what, you gonna just up and leave?\" he said, his usual 'I don't give a fuck' tone returning and I knew he was going back into himself. \"Yes\" \"But…\" \"Bye Tommy\" \"Erika!\" I turned around looking straight at him. \"What Tommy?\" Except he didn't say anything, he just stood there looking straight threw me. \"I'm fucking leaving\" I said taking a step out. But I heard a loud thud causing me to turn around and saw Tommy remove his fist from the plaster in the wall. \"I hate you Erika!\" he screamed. \"Well you're lucky aren't you?! Coz I'm leaving now and I don't intend to come back!\" \"I hate you! I hate…I hate what you do to me!\" \"What?\" I screamed scrunching up my nose. \"And I hate that I don't want you to go!\" he roared, before punching another hole in the wall. \"You're fucked up in the head Tommy Riordan!\" \"And so are you!\" \"Fuck you!\" I screamed kicking the door. \"And that's why…I know…I know that we…are meant for each other!\" \"You can't be serious…\" \"See! That right there! You say I can't open up and then I do and you just throw it back in my face!\" he shouted striding over, spitting in my face. \"I didn't! You're not the only one with problems Tommy! Are you the only one who is allowed to have emotional problems?\" \"No but don't throw everything back at me all the time!\" \"I didn't! I didn't fucking say anything!\" but then my gamy lung started acting up, causing a searing pain to pulse through my torso. \"Tommy…just go, just go and fight\" I said stepping out of the room and walking down the corridor, feeling more upset with Tommy than ever. I glanced behind me as I headed for the stairs and saw him staring at me from the doorframe. I hopped in a taxi and headed to the airport. \"You've got to have something…anything leaving as soon as possible\" I begged with the woman behind the airline desk. \"No, I'm afraid we don't and everything is booked up…your ticket is non-transferable as well. You're booked on a flight back to Pittsburgh on Tuesday\" \"But you have to have something!\" \"I'm sorry but you have to understand it's the Fourth of July weekend…it's one of our busiest times of the year…I'm sorry but I'm afraid you're stuck in Atlantic City\" he said and I saw her nose twitch smelling the alcohol off my breath. \"I can't be stuck here…\" I said burying my face in my hands. \"Well it's one of the best weekends to be in Atlantic City\" she smiled. \"Plus that big fight thing is happening so there are plenty of guys around, very good looking ones as well\" she winked. But her smile died seeing I was in no mood for this. I shrugged my shoulders and waited for her to offer me a lifeline but she didn't. \"I'm sorry Miss…I can put you on standby but all the flights are full\" I sighed loudly and grabbed my bag heading over to the seats. What was I gonna do now? I threw my head back and saw a television over in the corner. Shockingly, Sparta was on. I turned away and closed my eyes. Three hours later, I was still on standby. I was still sitting the same spot. I was still ignoring the Sparta coverage. I was still trying to ignore Tommy who was swimming around in my mind. I looked up and saw there was a flight leaving in an hour. I prayed someone got sick and had to pull out. \"Anything?\" I called over to the woman. \"I'll call down now and see but I highly doubt it\" she said with that sad smirk. \"We have some breaking news here about the enigma that is Tommy Riordan…we have learned that Tommy Riordan is actually Thomas Conlon who went AWOL from his company after his brother in arms was killed in Iraq…that was why his service records couldn't be found\" I looked up and saw a team of military police marching into the stadium and into the dressing room. I jumped out of the metal chair and ran over to the TV. A solider appeared on the screen looking teary eyed. \"Tommy Conlon saved my life…the water was coming in from everywhere…the pressure was too much for us to push the door…we were just about to give up but then we saw the back door open up and Tommy dragged us out. Tell Tommy thanks from me. You saved my life brother\" he said before wiping his eyes. I felt something deep within my chest ache. \"Tommy Riordan, actually Thomas Conlon is fighting in Sparta this weekend and is due to be arrested for deserting his unit after the final fight tonight\" said one presenter. \"So wait…does that mean that the final tonight is between two brothers?\" said the other presenter. My whole body went numb. \"O wow, I think you're right…yes Tommy Conlon verses Brendan Conlon. Watch out mom! Lock up your china the boys are at it again!\" they both laughed, like the fucking tools they were. This was anything but funny. And Tommy was going to have to deal with it on his own. He already had all this shit going on in his head and then me arriving like a tool and putting more unnecessary pressure on him. What was wrong with me…if I was Tommy I would have told me to fuck off a long time ago…even if nothing happens with Tommy and me, I knew we had too much history now for me to leave him. Also, I was one of the few people that knew the problems between the Conlon brothers. Look at me considering other people's feelings…I was slightly shocked at myself. \"Miss…there is a seat available!\" she called over. \"Miss!\" \"What?\" I said not really listening. \"There is a seat available…there will be a last minute fare on it though\" Then something clicked in my head. I raced over, grabbed my bag and headed for the door. \"Miss…do you not want the seat?!\" \"No thank you! I have to stop being a selfish bitch!\" I yelled back as I ran back out to the taxi rank, looking at her bewildered expression.[Chapter 12] Hello everyone! How is everyone doing? New chapter so I hope you enjoy it :) I also have a Cape Wrath story going if you want to check that out, Tom Hardy's dark, disturbed character is amazing to write about :) So here we go, enjoy and sure leave a review :) Thank you to all my lovely readers and reviewers, you're all amazing :) xoxo -Sailor I hopped straight in a cab and back to the hotel. I raced back up to Tommy's room but there was no one there. He was probably already at the stadium warming up. I dropped my bag in Tommy's room before legging it back down the stairs and out onto the pier that was flooded with people. I tried as hard as I could to get through them as fast as possible but most of them were drunk and enjoying the rides and acts that was going on all around them. I pushed past most of them but hit a wall when I reached the stadium. The line to get in was ridiculous and they all had tickets, how was I supposed to get in? I stood anxiously in the queue as I inched ever closer. But just as I was planning on pushing my way up to the front, I saw someone walking past the glass doors. It was Tommy. \"TOMMY!\" I screamed causing all the other fans around me to look at me, disgust and annoyance on their face. Someone stopped him and was asking him questions, most of which he just shrugged off and looked around with that look of disinterest he uses with me. \"TOMMY!\" I screamed again, my voice straining again. He didn't look up at all and the guy finally let him go and he continued walking. I had had enough of this. I jumped over the rope we were queuing along and ran up to the huge men at the doors. \"Tommy!\" I yelled again but he still didn't hear me. \"Ticket holders, queue behind the rope please\" \"No dude, you don't understand. I'm with Tommy, Tommy Conlon!\" \"Yea sure, I've been hearing that all night, seems Tommy got alotta girlfriends. I didn't let them in and I ain't letting you in\" \"No! You don't understand, I really am Tommy's girlfriend\" I felt my mouth go dry as I said the last word. \"Yea sure you are. Now you either get back in line or I ain't letting you in at all\" People from behind me yelled and shouted saying I wasn't about to skip the queue, they were here since blah blah blah but nothing was stopping me getting to Tommy. A few even went so far as throwing empty beer cans at me. \"If you get Tommy and bring him out, he'll vouch for me\" \"Ok…supposing you are who you really say you are. Why you ain't already in there with him? Supporting him? Why you out here?\" He just asked the question that everyone was dying to know the answer to, including myself but I didn't have the answer. \"Exactly\" he smiled triumphantly thinking he had outsmarted me. \"Now go back in the line\" I turned and walked back down a few steps but saw immediately that my place was gone. This wasn't how it was all going to end, not like this. I turned back around and saw him flipping through some pages clearly seeing whose name was there and whose wasn't. I started into a run before hopping over the rope he had blocking off that entrance. I punched him lightly in the nose just to stun him really while I made my run for the open door. \"Fuckin' stop her!\" I heard him yell and within minutes there were guards and stadium staff hot on my heels. I pushed my way through the crowd which was easier for me than for them because there was only one of me and I was smaller and lighter on my feet. I thought I saw Brendan up ahead but just as I was about to yell his name I felt someone grab my feet and I fell, face down on the floor. \"Brendan!\" I screamed just as two more guys jumped on me and I tried to wriggle out from under them. Brendan turned and brow furrowed clearly wondering who, if anyone just called his name. I suppose looking down at the floor wasn't the first choice. But luckily all the security caught his attention. He looked down and his eyes widened seeing me lying there with mountains of security men on top of me. Lucky for me, Brendan was street wise. \"What are you fuckers doing to my missus!\" he roared. \"What?\" they all gasped. \"Get the fuck off her!\" \"She jumped over after we refused her…\" one huffed. \"Let me guess she told you she was my wife you didn't believe her, you fuckers! When this is over you can expect to hear from my attorney!\" he said lifting me off the ground and wrapping his arm around my shoulder. \"Not letting my wife in, what kind of show you running here!\" he yelled as the other fighters turned to listen. \"Did you see that? Attacking not just a woman, but my wife!\" he screamed as he walked me in through the double doors that were only for fighters and VIP's. I couldn't help but laugh a little at Brendan's outburst. He turned to look at me as soon as the doors were closed. \"You came back, kid\" he smiled. \"I know…there's just something about Tommy…\" \"Hey you don't have to explain or justify anything to me\" he smiled. \"But you're fighting Tommy, surely…\" \"It doesn't matter, he's still my brother. And if someone who means something to him is in trouble…I'll do what I can to help. We're brothers at the end of the day\" I reached over and hugged him. \"Do you think I have time to see him or?\" \"I don't know…the military police are guarding his dressing room, make sure he doesn't run\" \"Hey Brendan! C'mon man we gotta go!\" I heard a guy running up to us shout. \"Who's this?\" he asked looking me up and down. I'm assuming this guy was his trainer. \"This is Erika, Tommy's girlfriend\" I got a slight pang in my gammy lung. Still wasn't used to that. \"Tommy's got a girl?\" he asked in the exact same shocked tone that Brendan did. \"Well…\" I started just to be an awkward arsehole but Brendan cut across me. \"Yea he does, she had a little trouble getting here…didn't ya?\" he smiled down at me knowing he didn't mean my fight with security. \"It was nice meeting you but I gotta take your brother in law away\" \"Right yea, Erika go find a place to sit down and I'll probably see you after the fight\" he said with a sad smirk. He knew what he had to do, but I wouldn't imagine it made it any less painful. But I couldn't concentrate on that, I needed to get to Tommy. I looked over to where the light shone out of the opposite side of where Brendan walked. That would be my best bet I'm assuming, but like Brendan said the military police were guarding all entrances and exits. \"Could all fans please take their seats, the fight will begin shortly\" I heard the announcer say and I felt sick with worry. I raced over to the door but two military guards stopped me. \"Are you authorised to enter here ma'am?\" one spoke. \"I'm Tommy's girlfriend that gives me some authority and standing I would imagine\" I snapped. They both looked at each other and turned back. \"Sorry ma'am, no one in or out\" \"Please you don't know what I have been through to get here…you can't stop me now, not that I'm so close. I need to tell him something!\" \"Whatever you have to say to him can wait until after the fight can it not?\" the other piped up. \"No it really can't!\" \"Well I'm sorry but you can't go in, we have to watch Mr Conlon to make sure he doesn't run, he's a deserter after all\" I bit my lip, trying not to lose my temper. No one here understood him. \"No…\" Then I felt two hands on my shoulders. I turned around and saw a huge pair of hands of a stadium official. \"Ma'am, could you please take your seat?\" \"No…I have to see Tommy\" If I have to explain this to one more person I might totally lose my mind. \"I'm sorry but we can't allow you in\" piped up the military guard. \"Yea we can't, no one in the fighter's dressing room at this time\" joined in the stadium official as soon as the guard stopped talking. \"Guys! Neither of you understand!\" I yelled. \"I need to see Tommy Conlon!\" \"Why, who are you to him?\" \"I'm…I'm his girlfriend\" \"Sorry, can't allow it\" the stadium official mumbled before dragging me over to a free seat and popping me down in it. I was two rows from the arena and could actually smell the sweat, which made me ill. I let out a huge breath, my knees beginning to shake glancing around at all the screaming, drunk MMA fans who were waving their t shirts around screaming, demanding the match to start now. Clearly they were out for blood while I felt a blood clot forming in my brain with worry. \"I don't think this has ever happened before, two brothers fighting in the final!\" shouted the commentator. \"I know! I hear they were asked to come to a press conference and discuss it but Tommy Conlon declined to do any interview with his brother…\" \"Sounds to me like there's no brotherly love lost between these boys!\" \"I know lock up your China Mom the boys are at it again!\" they both laughed. Wankers. This was anything but funny. Then the whole stadium went dark and a booming voice came across the intercom. \"Ladies and gentlemen! Let's go to waaaaaaaaar!\" screamed the intercom making the whole stadium stand on their feet and roar. I got a cold shiver running through my whole body as the lights from each side suddenly lit up and I saw the shadow of the two Warriors fall across the floor. I bit my hand as I saw Tommy walking out, his black hood blocking everything around him from his sight. I was going to call out but I couldn't bring myself to, besides he wouldn't have heard me. He walked out to no music, nothing just the voices of his fellow marines, who still supported him, ringing out around the stadium giving me goose bumps as I bit the back of my hand harder, my knee shaking furiously.[Chapter 13] Hello everyone! First of all, let me apologise sincerely for not updating any of my Tom Hardy stories including The Take: Freddie Jackson, Cape Wrath: Jack Donnelly and Forrest: Listen as the nightingale sings. I literally have had no time to write whatsoever, I have college exams coming up really soon and I've been studying so much. Trust me, I am not having any fun whatsoever and I would totally prefer writing my Tom Hardy stories for you lovely people :) But unfortunately I can't.

I normally do not write in this format, but I thought I'd give it a go. I would like to thank Toni for helping me out with this fic! Thanks! The sound of people fighting, the smell of blood, sweat and tears, these were the characteristics of where Diana worked. The mixed martial arts gym wasn't exactly a place for a young woman to work, she was probably the only woman who had ever done so. Hey, it paid the rent. Diana sat down behind her desk and booted up the computer. Her office was a small glassed in area at the entrance of the gym. She was supposed to take in calls, sign up anyone who wanted to join and generally push paper around. A waist high barrier separated the local fight fans and the gym itself. It was a small place, but it was workable. It always took a while for the computer to boot, so Diana wandered around flicking on the light switches. It was her job to open and close the place, it was a long work day, but Diana didn't mind, she didn't really have anything else to do except work. Diana had moved to the United States after getting a degree in history in her home country of the Netherlands. Working at the gym wasn't exactly the job she'd had in mind, but it'd do for now. It was really hard finding a job with a major in history. Her parents had warned her that she might not find a job in her field, but Diana always believed that you should do what you loved. After an hour more people started to arrive at the gym. Almost all the men who trained here were trying to get a spot in the Sparta MMA tournament. The winner would be awarded 5 mill, a lot of money. Again the entrance of the gym opened and a tall, muscular man stepped inside. All the guys who trained here were extremely muscular, but this one was a beast. He had broad shoulders and huge biceps. He wore simple sweat pants and a hoodie over a t-shirt. ''Can I help you?'' Diana asked the man. She wondered if he was going to sign up. ''Eh… sure'' the man said, his eyes moved around the gym, then back to Diana. ''How does this place work?'' ''For 35 dollars a month you can train from 7 till 11'' Diana answered. ''Just fill out this form if you want to join'' Diana handed the man a form and a pen. He quickly filled it out and handed it back to her. 'Thanks' Diana said. She smiled at the man as he went toward the mats. Before she filed the information, Diana read that his name was Tommy Riordon. Diana found him intriguing, there was something about him. She looked over her shoulder, hoping to catch another glimpse. Through the glass she could see him bandaging his hands and tugging on some boxing gloves, ready to train. The slap and thump of people sparring didn't bother Diana anymore, she'd gotten used to it. It quite distracting at first, she felt an urge to intervene, but the bruises and blows were all part of the game. ''Diana, call that Puerto Rican kid!'' Colt Boyd shouted. Diana got up from her chair and looked through the glass. She saw a man sprawled on the ground, he had been knocked flat by Pete 'Mad Dog' Grimes. Someone got K.O.'d so regularly, it began to feel normal. Colt Boyd was the trainer of Mad Dog and the owner of the place. Mad Dog was this gym's hottest contender for the Sparta tournament. Diana never really liked Mad Dog. He was overly arrogant and had a nasty mouth. 'If he can get here in 20 minutes, he'll get two hundred bucks.' 'I'll call him!' Diana shouted from her ''office''. She quickly looked him up in the computer and started tapping his number into the phone. After waiting a half a minute Diana reached his voice mail. Shit, she thought. ''He's not picking up his phone!'' Diana said while walking towards Colt. She didn't really know who else to call, there weren't many guys who would take on Mad Dog. 'Dammit Diana!' Colt told her. 'Find me someone else!' Just when Diana was about to turn around and dig deeper into her contacts, Tommy spoke up. He had been watching Mad Dog fight and thought there was an opening for him. It had been a while since he had a real fight, but it would be a good opportunity. 'I'll fight him' he said to Colt. Diana was amazed, not many would offer to fight Mad Dog. Did you see Mad Dog's arms? After some hemming and hawing Colt agreed and let Tommy step into the ring. Diana really wanted to see Tommy in action. He must be good if he wanted to take on Mad Dog. Tommy knew he could take Mad Dog. He had watched him a bit and thought that his defense was weak, he would go for a K.O. Just one blow and Mad Dog was down. Diana was amazed. Tommy was even better than she expected. Tommy was better than anyone expected.[Chapter 2] Just a short one this time. I'm sorry but I had some trouble with the computer… Enjoy! A YouTube video of Tommy fighting Mad Dog went viral. Tommy Riordon was the buzz everywhere in the MMA business. Overnight he went from being a nobody to the newest MMA hot property. Tommy came to the gym every day. After that he trained with his dad, but he never called him that. Tommy's father had abandoned him when he most needed him. He was a good trainer, their relationship was all about training and nothing else. When she, Tommy and Colt were the only people left in the gym Diana began closing down the building. She securely fastened each window, making sure she'd gotten them all. 'I'm heading home' Colt said. 'Are you sure you can manage buttoning up the place?' Diana nodded and smiled towards Colt. 'Sure' she told him. Secretly, Diana hoped he would leave early. Because that would mean she had an excuse to talk to Tommy. Diana had noticed Tommy wasn't a big talker. He never talked to anyone except Colt. Colt was trying to get Tommy into the Sparta tournament. Diana had dug up phone numbers for some of Colt's old contacts. He would call around and try to get Tommy in. Diana didn't know if he had succeeded. The man of the moment was still pounding a punching bag when Diana approached him. Tommy always chose the punching bag at the back of the gym, he liked his privacy. 'I'm sorry to interrupt you' said Diana shyly. Diana didn't really know how to approach Tommy. He was always really reserved. She had only spoken to him once or twice. Tommy stopped landing punches and moved his eyes from the bag to Diana. 'We're closing in five minutes' she continued. Tommy nodded. 'Sure' he replied. Diana found Tommy had a really deep and rumbling voice. She wished she could hear it more often. Diana smiled awkwardly at Tommy and turned to make sure the back door was closed. She couldn't help but feel somewhat attracted towards him. She liked the mystery surrounding him. Who exactly was Tommy Riordan? She was eager to find out. Diana waited patiently until Tommy headed for the exit. After which she quickly turned off the lights and locked the door. She walked outside, just behind Tommy. This would be her chance to really speak to him. Don't be afraid and just talk to him, she thought. Diana had always been shy, but she had decided to put the fear behind her when she moved to the United States, start with a clean slate. But so far that had been proven harder than she thought. A leopard never changes its spots. 'You heading for the bus stop?' Tommy suddenly asked Diana. He had noticed she didn't have a car, had seen that the parking lot was completely empty. Diana turned to Tommy. 'Yes, you too?' she asked him. Diana had noticed Tommy normally drove an old Chevrolet, but not today. 'Yeah' he answered. Diana felt really awkward, were they supposed to walk to the bus stop together, or both walk to the bus stop, but separately. 'Do you mind if I walked with you?' Tommy asked Diana. 'You know, it's dark.' Diana was surprised by his protectiveness. 'K!' Diana said quite relieved. The road leading up to the bus station wasn't lit by much more than a few lampposts. Tommy and Diana headed off to the bus stop. Diana had a feeling this was going to be awkward, but at the same time, she might really enjoy this short walk with him.[Chapter 3] Just a short chapter, but I wanted to post something. Next chapter will be longer, I promise! Tommy was the first to break the awkward silence 'How long have you been working at the gym?' Diana hoped she could keep the conversation going, this was probably the first time she really had a chance to talk to Tommy. 'Almost a year' Diana replied. She actually quite enjoyed working at the gym. It wasn't a dream job, but the money was OK. 'I never expected to meet someone like you at a place like that' Diana smiled softly. She took that as a compliment. 'It's not for forever, it's hard to find a job with a degree in history' Diana said. Tommy looked at Diana curiously. The more he talked to her, the more he liked her. Diana surprised him. 'History?' he asked her. 'I'm originally from The Netherlands' Diana replied. She told Tommy about her decision to move to the United States, about university and her family. Talking to Tommy seemed so natural, it felt like they'd known each other for years. Diana was surprised at how open Tommy had become. His normal cool and reserved self had thawed. With conversation, the ten minute walk to the bus stop went quickly. Diana wished they had more time. She felt she finally got the chance to know Tommy. The bus arrived soon after they had reached the stop. Tommy waited for Diana get on the bus first. Apart from the bus driver, they were the only passengers. 'Will you be entering the Sparta tournament?' Diana asked. She knew there was lot of interest in Tommy after the video of him and Mad Dog went viral. He should compete. 'I probably will' he replied. 'Colt is trying to enter me' 'I'm sure you will get in' Diana reassured him. Tommy's chances of winning the competition were good if he could defeat the Russian Koba. That guy was a major star in Russia. He won almost every competition he entered; the Sparta tournament would be his first US appearance. Tommy briefly smiled at Diana. She liked his smile, rare as it was, it added to his mysterious air. 'Don't you want to return to the Netherlands?' Tommy asked Diana. Well yes, Diana really wanted to go back to her home country, but as soon as Tommy walked through the doors of the gym she wanted to stay. Could you like someone you have only known for a few weeks? Someone you've barely spoken to? Diana's feelings confused her. 'Yes of course I miss it' Diana replied. 'But the chances of me finding a job in my field are greater here than in the Netherlands' We passed a few houses Diana recognized, which meant she was nearing her neighborhood. She had to get off soon, even though she didn't really want to. 'I have to get off at the next stop' she said. Tommy nodded and shifted his legs so she could get passed him. The bus stopped in front of the stop. 'Thank you for keeping me company' Diana told him smiling. 'Pleasure' he simply replied. Diana stepped down from the bus and turned. As the bus trundled down the street she smiled at Tommy and waved. To her surprise, Tommy smiled back at her.[Chapter 4] After that night, the short walk to the bus stop became a daily ritual for Diana and Tommy. As an excuse, Tommy told Diana he didn't like her walking alone to the bus stop. 'I've picked up some self defense moves!' Diana told Tommy, but Tommy still insisted he walk with her. Tommy's protectiveness was one of the many things Diana liked about him. Tommy visited the gym every day. Sometimes he stayed the whole day, other times he just came during the late afternoon, but he always took the opportunity to walk Diana to the bus stop. He never skipped a day. 'You look pretty today' a familiar, but unwanted voice said. Diana was behind her desk, filing some documents and updating the database. She turned to see who it was. Of course, Mad Dog. 'Uhm… thanks?' she said tonelessly. She had never liked Mad Dog. From the first he had been rude to her. He tried to flirt with her and even when she didn't respond, he still continued to hit on her. 'Did you something different with your hair?' Mad Dog continued. Diana rolled her eyes. Each time she rejected him; why didn't he get the hint? 'Not particularly.' Diana hoped her abrupt answers would turn him off. Diana enjoyed working at a gym, but moments like these really ruined it. However it was to be expected when working as the only woman at a testosterone fueled gym.. 'Yes, you did do something' Mad dog said, his eyes fixed on her. He extended his hand towards Diana's hair and twirled some of the strands around his fingers. Diana twisted her head away his hand. 'Could you not do that?' she told him. Her voice sounded even more brusque than before. 'I'm sorry, darling' Mad Dog said with a really fake sugary voice. 'I won't do it again' Diana hated it when he invaded her space like that. It was abusive and made her feel like a victim. Tommy had been keeping an eye on the whole incident. He didn't want to stare directly, but he kept Diana in his sight. He didn't like it when Mad Dog, or anyone, talked to her like that. But Mad Dog being Mad Dog made it just a little worse. Ever since the fight Tommy despised Mad Dog. He hated his arrogance, he was just so full of himself. 'Just go away' Diana said to him. She fixed her eyes on the computer monitor. Mad Dog grinned at her and went back to the gym to train with Colt. Diana let out a small sigh of relief. She hoped he finally got the message, somehow she doubted it. The last few hours of work passed quietly. Colt kept Mad Dog preoccupied with intense training. He left the gym soon after his session, but not without saying a 'See you tomorrow, honey' followed with a wink. Ugh, ick, Diana hated him. While Diana locked the backdoor and checked the windows, Tommy took off his boxing gloves and packed his bag. Diana turned off the computer and waited in the foyer for Tommy. 'What did Mad Dog want?' Tommy rumbled. 'Nothing' Diana replied, while turning off the lights. They both went outside and Diana locked the door behind her. 'You didn't seem too happy talking to him' Tommy said offhandedly. Diana noticed Tommy hadn't liked it when Mad Dog talked to her. She guessed it was his protectiveness, or was it jealousy? 'I don't like his attitude' Diana replied. They headed off and starting walking in the direction of the bus stop. It wasn't exactly a romantic stroll, but the dim streetlights could count as mood lighting. Tommy nodded in agreement. He couldn't stand him either. 'Why are you asking?' Diana asked, curious. She wanted to find out his intentions. She half-hoped he was jealous, although he had nothing to be jealous of, Diana definitely didn't like Mad Dog nor did she find him in any way attractive 'Just curious' Tommy answered. They were already close to the bus stop. Tommy had never opened up to her. Diana didn't really know much about his background or his past, whereas he knew almost everything about her. She wished he would confide in her. The fact that Tommy brought Diana 'home' every night made her feel safe and secure. It was nice knowing someone cared about you. Tonight the bus was quite full. Apart from Diana and Tommy there was an elderly lady, two boys around the age of 17 and a woman who was somewhat older then Diana was. Compared to the two skinny boys, Tommy was even more huge than he usually looked. Even though Tommy looked like a beast and took out his anger everyday on a punching bag and people who dared to spar with him, Diana never felt uncomfortable around him. Instead, he he made her feel the opposite. The bus stopped in front of Diana's home. The elderly lady and the two boys had already left the bus at a previous stop. 'Would you like to come in?' Diana said out of the blue. Did I really just say that? Diana thought? She was surprised at herself. Tommy looked a bit surprised. He did not expect that. 'Sure!' Tommy said enthusiastically. 'Why not ?' Diana lips tugged upwards into a smile. She couldn't believe she just said that, but she was glad she did. She hoped that Tommy would finally open up to her. She wanted to get to know him as well as he knew her. They both got off the bus and followed the stone path which led to the front door of Diana's small house. Her house really wasn't large, but it was just right for her. Besides, Diana liked small places, it added a certain charm and coziness. The outside of the house was done in white siding. A red door and windows finished the homey look. 'Don't expect too much' Diana said to Tommy. He softly smiled. 'It looks cute' Diana couldn't help but feel butterflies fluttering around in her stomach. She realized these feelings about him weren't going away any time soon. She unlocked the front door and opened it. She brushed her feet against the doormat before going in. She waited for Tommy to enter before re-locking the door. She threw her keys on the cabinet beside the door. 'Make yourself at home' Diana said smiling. She could feel those butterflies fluttering in her stomach again. She felt somewhat nervous, but promised herself it would be alright. She led Tommy towards the living room. She could only imagine what would happen this evening.[Chapter 5] Just a quick chapter to get something out there for you guys! I'm sorry for the lack of updates, I've just been really busy with school. Sorry for the grammar/spelling mistakes, I'm Dutch, not a native English speaker. Enjoy! 'Can I get you something?' Diana asked Tommy nervously. She didn't really know what she had stocked up, but she could offer some beer. 'Just whatever you have' Tommy replied while he sat down on the couch. Diana turned on the television for some background noise. She walked into the kitchen and pulled the fridge open. She took two beers and uncapped them with a bottle opener before walking back to the living room. 'These are the best beers you'll ever have' Diana said smiling while handing Tommy one of the bottles. The beer she had brewed in the Netherlands. She had asked her parents to send her some of Bavaria beer because she couldn't stand the American brands. 'Yeah, you're right' Tommy said after taking a sip. 'These do taste a lot better, but as a girl, shouldn't you drink wine or something?' He said teasing. Diana never enjoyed the taste of wine, although she did agree with him. A glass of wine does look a lot more elegant. 'I suppose it is' she said. 'I just don't really like the taste' Diana sat down next to Tommy and smiled at him. Tommy could sense she was nervous. 'Before you go to Sparta you have to teach me some self defense techniques' Diana said. 'Because then I have to walk that unlit route all by myself.' 'You have been working at that gym for what, a year, and you still haven't picked up anything?' he said teasingly. 'I work the computers, not the punching bags' Diana replied grinning. Tommy put his beer on the coffee table which stood in front of the couch. 'I'll show you something right now' He stood up from the couch and reached his hand towards Diana. Diana took his hand and stood up. 'Don't laugh at me if I'm really bad.' Trying to conceal his grin, Tommy said: 'I won't.' Tommy took both of Diana's hands. 'Now, what would you do to escape from me?' he asked her. His grip was firm, but he made sure he did not hurt Diana. 'Probably nothing' Diana said, trying to hold in her laugh. 'How could I escape you?' What Diana said was true, Tommy was extremely muscular, and she wouldn't stand a chance against him. 'No, you have to try' Tommy said, suddenly serious. Diana tried to pull her arms to escape Tommy. Of course it didn't work. She had no idea what to do. Tommy noticed her failing to escape him. 'You should try this' he told her. He let go of her hands and then demonstrated some self-defense moves. Diana tried imitating them, with some help she could do the techniques. 'How am I going to remember this on times of panic?' Diana asked Tommy. She was serious, she forgets everything when she's in a state of panic. 'Just think of me and you'll remember' Tommy said ensuring Diana. Diana couldn't help but blush, he was so sweet to her. 'Come on, let's try a couple more times.' Tommy took Diana's hands again, he tightened his grip somewhat more, but he made sure he did not hurt her. Diana applied the technique Tommy told her to use and she escaped from Tommy's arms. 'You seem to get the hang of it' Tommy said. 'Want to try something more difficult?' Diana liked the sound of that. This self-defense teaching thing was the perfect excuse to be inside of Tommy's arms. 'Sure!' She replied. Behind her, the television switched from a re-run of Friends to the news. Tommy came closer to her. He placed his hands on her lower back. Slowly, he moved his head closer towards Diana's head. 'I'm not sure I want to fight this' Diana said, smiling softly. She could feel her cheeks turning red. The butterflies in her stomach were uncontrollable. Just when their lips were about to meet, something on the television caught Diana's attention. She moved her eyes towards the television. 'Wait, is that you?' She said surprised. Was she really seeing this? Was that Tommy on the television? War Hero. That was all the newsreader could talk about. Tommy was a war hero? No, wait, he was in the marine corps? An interview was shown. It was with the man who Tommy supposedly had saved. 'Tommy?' She asked again. 'Is that you?' Tommy just stared at the television, his face was emotionless. He then looked at Diana. 'Uhm… yeah' he said after a while. 'Why didn't you tell me this?' Tommy knew everything about her. She knew absolutely nothing about him. Tommy was all quiet. He didn't know what to say. He didn't want to talk about his time in the corps. He found it private. 'Tommy' Diana continued, since Tommy wasn't really intending to talk. 'I'm really trying to understand, but why won't you tell anything about yourself to me?' Diana kept looking at him. 'I just want to get to know you…' 'I think it's time for me to go…' Tommy said somewhat insecure, still staring at the television. 'Why?' Diana said puzzled. 'Did I say something wrong?' And before she knew it, Tommy had put on his hoodie. 'I'll see you' He told her, before heading outside the door. 'I guess so…' Diana replied softly, but he had already left.[Chapter 6] With mixed feelings Diana went to bed. She felt very confused. Why was it Tommy wouldn't open up about his past? Why did he leave her in all of a sudden? She had a lot of questions and she doubted if they ever will be answered. One thing Diana did know she was angry at Tommy. How could he think he could just leave her like that? With an feeling of aversion Diana went to work. She took a bus earlier than she normally did, it was to avoid an awkward run in with Tommy. She wondered if he would walk her to the bus stop after last night. While riding the bus Diana couldn't stop thinking about the fact that she and Tommy almost kissed. She wondered what would've happened if she hadn't turned on the TV, if Tommy hadn't stormed out of her house. She could only wonder. Because she took an earlier bus she was the first one to arrive at the gym. Luckily she had the keys so she could unlock the place. She liked to keep busy, it would keep her mind of things. She unlocked the door and went inside. She put her stuff behind the desk and opened a few windows in the gym. While the computer booted up she made sure all the toilets were clean. Soon after that the first few people started to arrive to train. They all greeted her nicely. Diana had moved behind her desk to file some left over papers from yesterday. She greeted Colt as he entered the door with a somewhat fake smile. 'Diana, can I ask you a favor?' Colt asked. 'Sure!' Diana said. Anything to keep busy, anything. 'I'm going to train with Mad Dog later, could you help us out for a bit?' Anything, but that. 'Is that going to take long?' Diana tried to think of an excuse. Normally she would do anything for Colt, but she wasn't going to help Mad Dog. 'I need to file a lot of papers, and if have some people I have to call…' 'It'll just take a few minutes' Colt said, unaware of the fact Diana really didn't wanted to do this. 'Well, okay then…' Diana said annoyed. Mad Dog had arrived a couple of minutes after Colt. He was quite amused by the fact she was going to assist Colt while training him. Diana was not amused. A few hours passed and still no sign of Tommy. She wondered if he ever was going to show up. 'Diana, I need your help now!' Colt shouted from the back of the gym. Diana sighed, she hoped he'd forgotten she'd help him. She got up from her chair behind her desk and gathered enough confidence to walk towards the ring. She hoped Mad Dog would behave himself. 'What do you want me to do?' Diana asked with an irritated tone in her voice. 'Here, hold this.' Colt handed her a stopwatch. Are you serious? Diana thought. He's dragging me all the way over here to hold a stopwatch? 'A stopwatch?' Diana asked Colt with an raised eyebrow. 'Yes, I want you to record the time' Colt put on his boxing gloves, as did Mad Dog. 'Aw, sweetheart, just help me record my record-breaking times!' Mad Dog said, smiling at her. 'First of all, I'm not your sweetheart' Diana started. 'Second of all, can't you get someone else to do this?' Diana found this quite pointless. It wasn't like all the other guys in the gym were too dumb to understand a stopwatch. Anyone could understand a stopwatch. She began thinking there was something behind this. Maybe Mad Dog told Colt he liked her and now he was trying to hook her and Mad Dog up. She hoped this wasn't the case. 'Just do it, please' Colt asked. Diana rolled her eyes and did what Colt asked her. While Mad Dog was throwing punches and running circles around the ring, she recorded every time and neatly wrote them down. Diana was so busy recording times she didn't even notice Tommy had entered the building. She hadn't noticed him until she looked up to see if Mad Dog had finished his short break. She saw him standing at his usual spot at the back of the gym. His back was faced towards her. Had he seen her? 'Are you impressed by my times?' Mad Dog said while he sat down on the chair next to her. 'Yes, very impressive' Diana said sarcastic. She turned to the paper again and wrote down some other statistics. 'You have a pretty handwriting' he said, pointing his finger at the neatly written down statistics. Diana found him incredibly desperate. She looked over to the corner where Tommy was standing. He was looking in the direction of her and Mad Dog. She quickly looked away and replied to Mad Dog: 'Umm.. thanks?' 'You want to go out to grab something to eat later? Or have a drink?' Mad Dog asked. 'Or something else?' Oh god, Diana thought. 'No thank you' she said, with absolutely no emotion in her voice. 'Please?' Mad Dog said. 'I have other stuff to do' Diana said while she stood up from her chair. She went back to her little office, only to be stopped by Mad Dog on the way. Mad Dog stopped Diana from walking by putting his hand on her shoulder. 'I would like it if you would not touch me…' She said. She was starting to become really annoyed. 'Just one drink, I'm buying' he still continued. Why didn't this guy get a hint? 'The lady said no' a voice said from behind Diana. The voice sounded familiar. Diana turned around, only to find Tommy standing there. 'The lady can decide for herself!' Mad Dog said, turning to Tommy. Mad Dog's body language completely changed as he faced Tommy. He started to stand more up right, trying to intimate Tommy. Diana appreciated the fact that Tommy stood up for her, but she hadn't forgotten about last night. She needed to find out what exactly happened to him, what made him leave all of a sudden? 'Whatever' Mad Dog said. As he passed Tommy to go back to the ring, he knocked his body into the side of Tommy's shoulder. Diana hoped Tommy could control himself. She didn't really want to deal with anyone unconscious. Diana and Tommy were now face to face. Diana knew this was her moment to talk. 'What was that yesterday?' She asked him. She hoped that unlike yesterday, he wouldn't leave her in the dark.[Chapter 7] Hi! Sorry for the long wait for the next chapter, I was very busy and had a major writers block! I'm not a native English speaker, so please ignore the mistakes. I hope you like it and please review! Diana saw that Tommy had a hard time finding the right thing to say. She wondered why Tommy was so secretive about his past. 'Let's just say those were times I want to forget' Tommy muttered. His face showed little emotion, he was so hard to read. Diana didn't understand what Tommy meant, the newsreader said he was a hero! 'From what I understood from the news you were quite the hero…' Diana tried to make eye contact with Tommy, but he looked right past her. 'I don't want to talk about it' Tommy said while turning around. He started walking towards the door. Diana wasn't going to have it. 'Tommy, wait!' She shouted after him. Tommy didn't respond and left the building, with Diana close behind him. Tommy sighed softly and then turned around to face Diana. 'Look, I understand that some things happened in your past that you don't want to talk about' Diana started. 'But you can't just blow me off like this' Diana didn't know what she felt for Tommy. She liked him, a lot. Hell, she wanted him, but he was so hard to read, she didn't know what he thought, what he wanted. He must care about me, she thought. He stood up against Mad Dog for me, not a lot of men would stand up against Mad Dog. 'I'm sorry' Tommy responded softly. It wasn't the answer Diana had hoped for, he had let her down, again. To make matters even worse Tommy left. He turned around and got the keys of his Chevy out of his pocket and unlocked the car. He reversed the car aggressively and left the parking lot, he left Diana. The bar was full of people all cheering on the big game which was being shown on a big screen in the back of the bar. Diana sat down at one of the tables, waiting for her drink. She couldn't believe she did this, was she out of her mind? 'Here you go' Mad Dog said as he put down a glass of wine in front of her. Ugh, wine, she hated wine. 'Thanks' she replied, a fake smile covering her face. After the whole Tommy debacle she agreed to go out with Mad Dog. What did she had to lose anyway? Although she must admit, she hoped Tommy would somehow find out. She hoped he still cared about her, she hoped he would get jealous. Diana raised the glass to take a sip. The smell of the wine made her nauseous; it was dry wine. She didn't particularly like sweet white wine, but dry white wine was even worse. But Diana was raised polite, so she sipped from her drink, hoping it wouldn't take her long to finish it. 'So tell me a bit about yourself?' Mad Dog asked Diana. She couldn't tell if he was genuinely interested, or he just asked that to keep the conversation going. 'I'm sure you already know everything about me' Diana replied, taking another sip from her drink. This was going to be a very long night. Mad Dog and Diana had been at the bar for at least a couple of hours. She was surprised to say that she was enjoying herself. Yes, Mad Dog was a jerk, but he was a fun jerk. They had been playing pool all night and Diana was drinking her wine like if it were orange juice. Diana liked that Mad Dog wasn't as troubled as Tommy. Mad Dog was just the distraction she needed. Diana put down the billiards cue and announced that she needed to use the restroom. She had been losing all night, Mad Dog wasn't a gentlemen who would let you win. With some difficulty Diana reached the ladies room. She was feeling very nauseous and dizzy all of a sudden. Well, she did drink a lot of alcohol… She quickly touched up her make-up and decided that from now on she'd only drink water. When she returned from the ladies room she noticed a familiar face. Tommy, he was ordering a drink at the bar. Diana quickly walked past him, full of surprise that Mad Dog and him hadn't jumped each other yet. Walking was getting harder with every step she took. Her vision was also slightly off. I've never been this drunk, Diana thought suspiciously. Mad Dog had noticed Tommy, he kept him in his sight while Diana quickly went past him. It was time to leave, it was only a matter of time before Tommy noticed her and things would be getting ugly. Just when Diana was about the reach the pool table where Mad Dog was standing she tripped, causing her the fall with a large smack on the ground. If she didn't had Tommy's attention before, she'll sure have it now… And indeed, Tommy looked over his shoulders to see what happened, only to find Diana struggling to stand up. He quickly walked over her, but Mad Dog had already picked her up. 'She had a little bit too much to drink' Mad Dog said half smiling. Mad Dog sat Diana down on one of the chairs. 'She can't take alcohol too well' Tommy observed Diana as she was sitting down on the chair. Her head was bobbing back and forth and her eyes were dim. He knew something was up, he had seen these symptoms a few too many times before. 'What did you do to her?' he asked Mad Dog, angrily. 'What do you mean?' Mad Dog said, like he knew nothing about it. Tommy knew better, Mad Dog had everything to do with this. 'You know damn well what you did' Tommy told Mad Dog. One thing Tommy knew for sure, he wasn't going to get away with this. Tommy stepped forward, challenging Mad Dog. Mad Dog stood taller than Tommy, but Tommy knew he could take him down easily. Mad Dog crashed his shoulders against Tommy's shoulders. He wasn't going to back off easily. Tommy knew that this was his time to strike. He stepped up, took a swing with his right arm and let his fist crash with Mad Dog's jaw. It had been a long time since Tommy had got into a fight without his boxing equipment. Even after one punch his knuckles were already bleeding. Before Mad Dog responded, Tommy quickly checked Diana. From the corner of his eye he could see her still sitting on the chair, resting her head on the table. She had no idea what was going on right now, no idea that Mad Dog had drugged her. Mad Dog's fist went straight in the direction of Tommy's nose, only to be blocked by Tommy's both hands. Mad Dog stumbled back a few steps and regained his composure, but he took too long. Tommy had already put his fist against his face once again, and he kept punching. He kept punching until someone had to break them up. Mad Dog was completely defenseless against Tommy. 'You two, quit it!' the barman shouted, while trying to break them up. It was hard to contain two fighting machines, it took multiple men to prevent them from jumping each other again. 'You' the barman nodded in Tommy's direction. 'Out!' Mad Dog was badly hurt, his nose was broken and cuts and bruises covered his face. Someone had immediately grabbed the first aid kit, and began treating the cuts. Tommy on the other hand was unharmed, apart from his bleeding knuckles. Mad Dog was a much loved character in this bar, they completely ignored the fact that he just drugged an innocent girl. Tommy looked around, an angry look covering his face. He quickly went over to Diana, who was about to pass out on the floor. He slipped his arm under her knees, his other arm around her waist and picked her up. He knew what Mad Dog's plan was and he wasn't going to let it happen.[Chapter 8] I'm not a native English speaker, so please ignore the mistakes. I hope you like it and please review! Diana was still fast asleep in the car while Tommy unlocked the door of her house. He had found the keys in Diana's purse. He let the door open and went back to the car to bring Diana in the house. Tommy didn't know what Mad Dog had slipped in her drink, but it would probably take another hour or two for Diana to wake up. With his right foot Tommy shut the door. He didn't know exactly which room of the house was the bedroom. He had been inside this house recently, but he had only been inside the living room. Luckily the first door Tommy opened happened to be Diana's bedroom. Tommy carefully placed Diana on her bed, making sure she wouldn't bump her head into something. He covered her with a blanked he found on the chair in the corner. Next, he sat down on the same chair, keeping an eye on Diana. Diana slowly opened her eyes, her head pounding. Where was she? She moved her arms behind her so she could sit upright, her head ache becoming worse. Why am I in my bedroom? She didn't know what had happened but her head felt like it was going to explode. 'Diana?' Tommy sat softly. As soon as he saw her opening her eyes he stood up and went to her. Tommy? Diana thought. What is he doing here? 'What happened?' Diana said, laying back down. Every inch of her body hurt, she felt like she had been running for hours. 'You tell me' Tommy answered. It wasn't only Diana who needed answers. 'What do you mean?' Diana asked. She had no idea what had happened the past few hours. 'Why are you even here?' Diana continued. The last thing she remembered was Tommy and her getting into an argument. She was not sure what Tommy was doing in her bedroom, had he been here long? 'You don't remember a thing?' Tommy said puzzled. He figured she would not remember the whole night, but from the look of it she didn't remember a thing. Diana shook her head, making it pound. She really had to stop moving. 'Could you get me a glass of water, please?' She asked Tommy. Right now she didn't really cared what happened to her, the only thing on her mind was making this pain stop. 'I'll be right back' Tommy nodded. Carefully, Diana sipped from her glass of water. She was anxious to find out what happened to her. Sure, she had been drunk before, but this was not a hangover. 'So, are you going to tell me what happened?' Diana asked. There was still tension between them. Diana could remember their conversation very clearly. 'You went out with Mad Dog –' Tommy started. 'Wait… wait a minute, I went out with Mad Dog?' Diana interrupted full of disbelieve. Why would I do that? This evening was getting stranger and stranger. 'Yes, you did' Tommy said dryly. 'Why?' Diana said somewhat disgusted. She just couldn't get to grips with it, her and Mad Dog, it just wasn't going to happen. Tommy ignored that question, although he had wondered it too. 'He drugged you and I happened to be there' Tommy continued to explain. Diana didn't know what to say. He seriously drugged her? She knew Mad Dog was an arrogant jerk, but this really surprised her. Mad Dog didn't look like the kind to drug you and then rape you. 'Are you serious?' Diana asked for confirmation. Tommy nodded, he was dead serious. 'I can't believe it…' Diana said. 'Why would he do that?' 'Why would you even go out with him?' Tommy responded aggressive. Diana was taken by surprise. 'What…?' she said softly. 'You heard me!' Tommy responded. Because of his impressive physique, Tommy looked even more intimidating when he was angry. 'I know as much as you do' Diana began, her voice trembling. Tommy was scaring her, she had never seen him so angry. 'Maybe I was hurt… and he was there …' she continued. 'HURT?' Tommy was now shouting, both his hands forming a fist. 'You know NOTHING about hurt.' Diana sat up against the headboard of her bed. She could feel her hands shaking. Quickly she pulled in her legs, making herself as small as possible. She didn't know what to say, it seemed like everything she could say only made things worse. Tommy came closer towards Diana. He rested his hands on the bed and leaned forward. 'Did you know what I had to go through during my time?' he began. 'You don't know anything about it!' He face was now only inches away from Diana's face. 'You're scaring me' Diana said frightened. 'You know nothing! Nothing!' Tommy continued, ignoring Diana completely. 'Tommy, stop!' Diana tried to sound convincing, but she could never take on Tommy. Suddenly Tommy realized what he was doing. He moved backwards, ashamed. Diana still kept Tommy in her sight, she shouldn't fear him, but still she did. 'Thank you for saving me' she said, breaking the silence. Tommy quickly looked Diana in the eye, and then he left the room. With a large bang he closed the door and a few seconds later Diana also heard the front door. The only thing that came to mind was cry, Diana cried and cried. She couldn't come to grips with what just happened. Apparently she went out with Mad Dog, apparently he drugged her, but Tommy saved her. Tommy saved her from Mad Dog. That idea confused her. The Tommy she just encountered was angry with her, why would he save her? Why would he save her if she went out with Mad Dog? And what had happened during his time in Afghanistan? She had so many questions… All of a sudden Diana wanted to see Tommy, she wanted to drive to his house, tell him it's alright, tell him she didn't know what she was thinking, tell him she's sorry. But then she realized she had no idea where Tommy lived… Diana had hardly slept that night. She was up all night thinking, thinking about things she should've said to Tommy. She wanted to call in sick for work but decided that she could use some distraction. She wiped away her tears and with a little help of concealer. she covered the dark circles under her eyes. She put on some basic jeans and a simple black t-shirt, good enough. She didn't know if she wanted to face Mad Dog, she was afraid of him, afraid of what he did, but she also wanted to make him pay. If he was at the gym she could easily confront him in front of all the others. But what she more hoped for was for Tommy. She knew chances were slim she would see him today. He would probably avoid both Diana and Mad Dog. But she perhaps she could find out where he lived, he had to fill in his address when he signed up at the gym… Luckily her headache had stopped, however her bones were still aching and the walk towards the bus stop didn't exactly made that better. She had already taken in multiple painkillers, so another one probably wouldn't hurt. She always carried some extra paracetamol in her purse, just in case. Politely she greeted the bus driver and sat down on a seat all the way in the back. She was fighting back the tears, but she had to be strong. She had to confront Mad Dog, he couldn't get away with this. After a short drive it was time for Diana to get off. She pressed the stop button, letting the bus driver know he needed to stop at the next bus stop. Before getting off Diana took in a deep breath. She could do this, she repeatedly told herself as she began walking towards the gym.[Chapter 9] So far I'm really enjoying writing this story :) I'm not a native English speaker, so please ignore the mistakes. I hope you like it and please review! Softly Diana opened the door of the gym, it was already unlocked so that meant that Colt was already there. She softly closed the door behind her and quickly scanned the gym for Mad Dog, luckily there was no sign of him yet, that meant she had some time to rehearse what she was going to say. Maybe she could tell Colt, and have him deal with it, Diana thought. However she quickly pushed that idea away, she needed to confront him herself, she couldn't hide behind other people for the rest of her life. 'Morning, Colt' Diana smiled as she sat down in her little office. She quickly booted up the computer and checked if there were any missed calls. 'Morning!' Colt shouted from the back of the gym 'Is Mad Dog coming in today?' Diana asked Colt. If he wasn't coming in today there was no point in rehearsing what she was going to say. 'Yeah, if all is well he should' Colt started. 'Why? You've got something going on?' Colt suggestively raised his eyebrows. 'Well, you could say that…' Diana said, and somewhat evil smirk covering her face. She kind of looked forward to confronting Mad Dog. She wanted to show she was not a weak and that she could stand up for herself. But first things first, Tommy's address. Diana pulled the folder with all the forms of all the members out of the cabinet. She quickly flipped the pages until she reached the letter R. There was Tommy's form. She quickly pulled it out the pocket. She scanned the paper for an address, only to find out there wasn't an address. He hadn't filled it in. Why didn't she notice this when he first signed up? She had some investigation work to do, someone must know where he lived or with whom he lived. Around 1 o'clock the moment Diana had been waiting for finally arrived. She had been working the phone all day and she was still talking to a supplier when Mad Dog walked in. He avoided her completely, not making any eye contact, he didn't even looked at her. Diana somewhat chuckled, she couldn't believe this. This was going to get interesting. Mad Dog's timing was perfect, the gym was packed with people, just in time for the showdown. Diana kept on rehearsing what she was going to say as the followed Mad Dog inside the gym. When Mad Dog came to a halt to put his equipment on a bench, he noticed Diana. Diana had crossed her arms in front of her chest and tapped impatiently with her foot. 'You've got some explaining to do' Diana said blunt. There was no emotion in her voice whatsoever. Mad Dog looked surprised and tried to search for words to explain. 'Did you really think you could get away with it?' she continued, raising her voice. Colt was busy talking to someone only a few feet from them, Diana's voice caught his attention and he turned to listen. And he wasn't the only one, a lot of the people in the gym had turned around to see what was going on. 'Get away with what?' Mad Dog said awkwardly. He continued by unpacking his stuff on the bench, putting on his gloves. His voice was notably softer than normal, he did not want other people to hear this. 'You know what I'm talking about' Diana said, also lowering her voice. As she was talking she moved her head closer the Mad Dog's head, letting him know she was dead serious. 'Fuck off, bitch' Mad Dog exclaimed. He then gave Diana a push in her shoulder, it wasn't a hard push, but it was enough for Diana to scream. 'DON'T TOUCH ME' she shouted. She sure got everyone's attention now. She took a few steps back from Mad Dog. 'You DRUGGED me!' she continued. 'Did you want to rape me?' Diana looked Mad Dog straight in the eye, waiting for him to respond. 'I did no such thing' Mad Dog said more towards the crowd who was watching than towards Diana. 'Yes you did, you slipped something in my drink' Diana looked at Colt for some back-up. Who the hell was going to believe her anyway? 'Is this true?' Colt asked Mad Dog. 'Fuck no!' he responded, a light sheath of sweat covering his face. Colt raised his eyebrows, waiting for an honest answer. 'Jesus, you are going to believe that bitch over me?' Mad Dog shouldn't had said that, he was a bad liar. Now Colt knew Diana was telling the truth. 'Mad Dog' Colt started calm. 'Get out of this gym' From the look of Mad Dog's face he couldn't quite believe what his was hearing. 'What?' he said questioning Colt's decision. Mad Dog was his most skilled fighter, was he just going to give him up? 'Out. Now.' 'Whatever' Mad Dog shrugged, picking up his bag angrily. 'And don't ever set foot in this gym again' Colt added. Diana felt very relieved. Not only had she confronted Mad Dog, but people also actually believed her. She feared because Mad Dog was a much loved character they wouldn't believe her. But something in her told her that all along Colt knew there was something up with Mad Dog. Mad Dog stomped out of the gym, slamming the door shut as he left. All the other guys in the gym continued their workout, talking about what the hell jus that happened. 'Are you alright?' Colt asked Diana. He walked cautiously towards her, he definitely wanted to find out what exactly had happened that night. 'Yeah' Diana said relieved. 'I'm sure you want to hear the whole story?' Colt nodded and led Diana to his office. Diana hadn't been in his office often. It was just as small as her little work area, but it was much nicer decorated. Posters of his old fighters covered the wall. Soon Tommy will also hang up there, Diana thought. Diana sat down on the sofa in front of Colt's desk and told him everything, everything Tommy had told her and she could remember. She didn't tell him about her and Tommy, that wasn't something he needed to know. Suddenly Diana realized that Colt might know there he lived, he must've visited him once or twice? 'Colt, do you happen to know where Tommy lives?' she asked. 'Why?' Colt said with a mysterious look. 'Just wanted to thank him for saving me' Diana replied, her face blank. As thing were kind of rough between her and Tommy she didn't want Colt to interfere. 'Yeah, I bet' Colt teased. 'I visited him a couple of weeks ago' Colt continued, now serious. 'Although I'm not sure if he's still living there…' 'Just tell me the address' Diana asked. She was desperate to find Tommy, to make everything right. Colt wrote down the address on a post-it and handed it to Diana. 'Good luck finding him' he winked. Diana took the post-it and figured Colt meant that she could go and search for him right away. She thanked Colt and quickly put on her jacket and left the gym. As she didn't have a car she had to take a different bus and maybe later a taxi, but that didn't matter. She just wanted to see Tommy.[Chapter 10] Finally a new chapter for you guys! I'm sorry for the wait, but I was busy finishing my Batman-story. I'm planning on finishing this story now, so I'll update more regularly, I promise! Please enjoy and review :) Diana closed her jacket while she walked up the steps. It was getting colder each day. After Colt had given her the address she immediately drove up to it. Colt had agreed to lend her his car, if she brought it back without a scratch. She had parked it carefully, making sure she hadn't bumped into something while parking, she wasn't the best driver. She pounded on the door of the house, since she couldn't find a doorbell. While waiting for someone to answer she turned her head to check out the neighborhood. It wasn't the best neighborhood, but it was better than where she lived. The house looked quite nice. The door opened, squeaking. 'Yes?' a deep voice said. The door had opened only a few inches and Diana could only see half of the man's face. The man was old, a lot older than Tommy. Colt had told her he was his father. 'Hi, I don't mean to disturb you' Diana started politely. 'But I would like to speak to Tommy?' Mr. Conlon snorted. 'He ain't here' he told her. Diana doubted whether what he told her was true. 'Well, if you see him, could you please ask if he could call me?' Diana asked. 'Yeah' Mr. Conlon said uninterested before closing the door. 'Goodbye to you too' Diana muttered before moving down the steps. If Tommy wasn't here, Diana didn't know where to look. She didn't had any further addresses to check and by now she was really starting to get worried. Diana returned Colt's car to the gym. It was getting late so she didn't bother about returning to work, there was no point anyway. She pulled up the sleeve of her jacket, checking the time on her watch. The bus was leaving in fifteen minutes, perfect. After a short bus ride Diana was finally home and she was desperate for a beer. She walked up the driveway, searching for the keys in her bag. Once again they were lost in the lining of her bag, she really needed a new one… It wasn't until she started to unlock the door that she noticed him. One part of her sighed in relief, the other part was bursting from anger. 'What are you doing here?' Diana asked unsure. She hadn't thought Tommy would come to see her, not after how he reacted. 'I was looking for you' Tommy replied softly. He placed his hands in front of himself to push himself up to stand. Diana stopped unlocking the door, she wasn't going to let Tommy in before he explained what had happened to her. 'Well, you've found me' Diana said dryly after a few seconds of awkward silence. Diana could see Tommy was searching for words. 'I'm sorry for how I reacted' he apologized. 'Your apologies do not mean a lot to me anymore' Diana snapped back. It was true, Tommy had apologized to her multiple times before, but his behavior didn't seem to change. He had to realize that he couldn't treat Diana this way. 'I know' Tommy muttered. This wasn't really going anywhere, but Diana had forgiven him so easily in the past. But this time he had really scared and hurt her. 'You scared me' Diana told him honestly. If he wasn't going to tell how he felt, then she was. Tommy pressed his lips together before saying: 'I shouldn't have reacted that way' 'Yeah, you already told me that' Diana was getting annoyed now. The fact that he once again couldn't explain why he reacted that way was getting fairly annoying. She turned the key in the lock, opening the door. 'Bye Tommy' she told him, an angry tone in her voice. When she tried to close the door behind her it was stopped by Tommy's foot. 'Wait' he said. Diana could finally hear some emotion in his voice. Wondering what he would want now she opened the door again. Raising her eyebrows Diana waited for him to start talking. But then Tommy did something she did not expect. He stepped forward and pressed his lips against hers, his hands softly sliding to the small of her back. This was all Diana's heart needed and eagerly she kissed him back. She couldn't quite recall how long she had been waiting to do this, and now it was finally happening. Unlike the happiness her heart was feeling, her head was telling her something different. A simple kiss couldn't make right what he had done. And for once Diana listened to her head instead to her heart. Diana placed her hands on Tommy's chest and softly pushed him away. 'I can't do this' she started. 'I can't let you kiss me knowing you'll leave me without warning later on' Tommy opened his mouth to say something, but nothing came out. 'You have to let me in, you have to tell me more about you' Diana still continued. 'You're practically a stranger to me' 'I can change…' Tommy replied. His hands were still placed on Diana's hips, not letting go of her. 'You have to prove it' It was hard resisting Tommy, she could feel her body longing for him, but she had to do this. If she didn't he would never change and she would get hurt all over again. Diana stepped back, forcing Tommy to let go of her. 'I'll see you tomorrow at the gym, okay?' Tommy nodded. 'Yeah, sure' he said. 'Bye' Diana smiled softly. Tommy returned the soft smile before leaving the drive-way. But even though he smiled Diana could see she had hurt him in some way. Perhaps he now knew how she felt when he left her, multiple times. She closed the door behind her and immediately went up to the fridge to get a beer, she needed that right now. Before putting the bottle to her lips, she traced her lips with her finger, right where Tommy had kissed her. Diana wondered whether if he was going to show up tomorrow. If he wasn't she knew that was the end of them. If he did it could be the start of something new.[Chapter 11] Another chapter, I'm really getting back into this story :) Please enjoy and review 3 To her surprise, Tommy was already waiting in front of the gym when Diana arrived. It made her smile to see that Tommy was really trying to change, but she oppressed her smile, not letting him win so quickly. As usual Diana was the one to open the gym, Colt arriving probably an hour later. 'Hi' she greet Tommy shyly as she approached him, the key already in her hand. 'Hi' he replied. Diana hoped that this wouldn't get too awkward. He probably knew that she enjoyed that kiss as much as he did, but still Diana wanted to see some progress with their relationship before they went any further. 'Colt will be here soon' Diana told him. Colt had been planning to train Tommy for the Sparta tournament now that Mad Dog was out of the picture. Still she couldn't remember much from that evening, and to be honest it was an evening she wanted to forget. Tommy nodded and walked straight through to the back of the gym to start warming up, his usual spot. Like every day, Diana booted up the computer and checked out the post they had received. It contained nothing special, like always. Diana couldn't help but glance over the back of the gym to see Tommy. He was already putting on his bandages. Quickly she turned away her head when Tommy noticed her looking and started typing away on the computer. After an hour or so Colt finally arrived at the gym. He immediately spotted Tommy in the back. 'So I see you found him' he winked. 'Actually he found me' Diana replied. A soft smile covered Colt's face. 'Maybe you two can grab some dinner later on' he said, raising his eyebrows playfully. 'Maybe' Diana answered, now also smiling. She had to admit she really liked that idea, maybe Tommy could tell something more about himself. Then suddenly she could feel her cell phone in her pocket vibrating. Unknown number , the dial read. Curious to see who it was Diana put the phone to her ear. 'Hello?' 'Diana, you have to let me talk to Colt, I have to train for Sparta!' Wait, was that Mad Dog? She couldn't believe what she was hearing, he sounded drunk too. 'How did you get my number?' Diana asked, completely ignoring what Mad Dog just said. 'You know I didn't drug you on purpose, please forgive me' he ranted on. 'And I'm Colt's best fighter, he needs me, you need me!' 'Actually, Tommy is his best fighter now' Diana replied. 'And I certainly do not need you. Don't call me again' Diana hung up the phone and put it in her bag, out of sight. If Mad Dog was to call again she wouldn't hear it. That was strange… Diana had a feeling that phone call wasn't the last time she heard of Mad Dog… Hours passed of Diana typing away behind the computer and running some errands. Tommy had been at the gym the whole day, training. He was really serious about this Sparta tournament… When Diana returned to fetch some training supplies from the local sports store it was about time to close the gym. All the other fighter had left apart from Tommy and Colt. As Diana was preparing to leave Colt and Tommy were approaching from the back of the gym, also getting ready to leave. 'I'm gonna go now' Colt said smiling before giving Diana a subtle wink. 'Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow' Diana replied, ignoring the wink. She stood up from her chair, put on her jacket and hung her bag on her shoulder. She would check later if Mad Dog had called. 'So…' Tommy started. 'Do you want to go and grab a bite to eat?' Diana smiled softly to herself, knowing Colt had been up to this, but she didn't really mind. 'Yeah sure' Diana smiled. She let Tommy go out first and then closed the door behind her. They walked over to Tommy's car and drove away. 'Where do you wanna go?' Tommy asked her. Somewhere we won't run into Mad Dog, she wanted to say, but she realized it was probably best not to mention Mad Dog. She did wonder if she should tell Tommy about him calling, but she decided that she would tell him maybe tomorrow or something. 'You decide' Diana said. 'Okay, I know a nice place' Tommy had been right, the diner he had chosen looked really cute, it had a real 50s vibe. Diana had never been here before, she liked trying out new things. They were seated in a booth by the window with a perfect view out over the street. Elvis Presley music was softly playing in the background. 'I didn't even know this place existed' Diana said while looking around, examining every inch of the diner. 'The food is really good' Tommy started. 'and I thought you might like the atmosphere' Diana smiled somewhat shyly. She loved the atmosphere, she had always been obsessed with the 50s, how come that she didn't know this place? A waitress (who was able to manage everything on roller-skates) handed them the menu. Diana quickly scanned over it, deciding on a strawberry milkshake and a classic burger. 'The same for me' Tommy said before handing back the menu to the waitress. 'So Colt told me you get to compete in the Sparta tournament' Diana said to start the conversation. She didn't want this to become awkward. Tommy nodded. 'I hope I'm good enough' Diana's lips formed a smile. 'Of course you are' Tommy smiled back, gratefully. Suddenly she could hear her phone vibrating in her bag. Diana sighed softly and pushed the bag on the ground. 'So I guess you want to know some more stories about my time in the corps?' Tommy asked. 'You know I do' Diana said still smiling. And finally Tommy started telling stuff about his time, telling Diana about the time he had saved a marine, about the combat they had engaged. Diana was all ears, she listened carefully to every word Tommy was telling, not daring to interrupt him. In the meantime their plates of food had been brought out, and he was right, the food was indeed amazing. It seemed like the evening had passed in a few minutes and before Diana knew it they were outside already. She had thoroughly enjoyed the evening, she loved how Tommy had been the one who spoke for the biggest part of the night. The fact that she knew more about him now made her feel more comfortable around him. He wasn't such a stranger anymore. Tommy drove Diana home. It was almost past midnight. Still Diana hadn't dared to check her phone. Mad Dog must have called her multiple times, she wasn't really intending on calling him back. 'Thank you for the dinner' Diana started when it was time to say goodbye. 'I really enjoyed it' 'Me too' Tommy nodded. Diana leaned closer to Tommy and pressed a soft kiss in his lips. 'Bye' she smiled before getting out of the car. The kiss felt just as good as it did yesterday, even better maybe. Diana threw her jacket on the couch and decided to check her phone in the morning, Mad Dog could wait. The butterflies in her stomach were almost uncontrollable, but she enjoyed the feeling. It felt good knowing that Tommy had really listened to her and was prepared to change his habits. The one thing she didn't really liked was Tommy competing in the Sparta Tournament. She had seen a similar tournament on the TV once and was hard to watch. She didn't want to see him get hurt…[Chapter 12] Thank you for the wonderful reviews 3 Diana's heart dropped a little when she saw that Mad Dog had left more than 20 messages last night. Of course when everything was finally going right something bad had to happen. Diana decided to ignore the messages. She wanted nothing to do with him. Colt had given her the morning off which gave Diana plenty of time to prepare herself. She had straightened her hair and put on some simple natural make-up, normally she wouldn't really had any time for this. It was past twelve when Diana finally reached the gym. It was a Tuesday which was their most quiet day of the week. Diana turned her phone off, if Mad Dog didn't stop calling her she had to consider changing her number or something. Still she wondered if she should tell Tommy about the calls. She could only imagine the reaction he was going to have. Diana decided she would tell him if the 'stalking' got worse. 'Excellent timing!' Colt said when Diana entered the gym. Like she expected it was almost empty. Diana raised her eyebrows, not sure what he meant. 'I need to go, but Tommy needs to train, so you can help him!' there was slight amusement in his voice. 'I doubt I can help…' Diana said, throwing her jacket and bag on the floor besides the desk. There was truth in what she said, how could she, with no fighting experience whatsoever, help him? He was also a lot stronger than she was… 'He'll think of something' Colt said and he was out of the door. Diana started walking towards Tommy. 'I'm supposed to help?' she asked uncertain when she approached him. 'You can help me with my cardio?' he asked. 'I do have some experience with a stopwatch' she replied, smiling. The next hour Tommy did push-ups, run around the gym and jumped rope, all while Diana was writing down his times. She did had to admit he looked kind of hot all sweaty and dirty. Diana grabbed one of the water bottles from a table in the corner and handed it to Tommy. 'Thanks' he said gratefully. Suddenly Diana could feel something vibrating in her pocket. I thought I turned it off? Swiftly Diana took it out of her pocket to check the caller-ID. Tommy nodded towards the phone. 'Shouldn't you take that call?' he said as Diana was staring at the screen. 'It can wait' Diana replied with a faint smile. Something inside her made her feel guilty for not telling the truth. 'When are you done working?' Tommy asked, taking off the bandages on his hand. 'Right now, as far as I'm concerned' Diana replied. She could use some time with Tommy, Mad Dog was haunting her mind and she wasn't liking it. Diana assumed that Colt would be back soon. She left a note for him on her desk and left with Tommy. Before they got into his car Diana said: 'I know this beautiful place we can go' Tommy nodded and smiled. 'Lead the way' 'How did you find this?' Tommy asked when they arrived. Diana had taken his hand and led him to the place she meant. She had stumbled on this by accident. The spot was right on the edge of the park, right where a small lake was situated. Not many people knew it was there, but Diana did. She came here often to clear her mind. 'By accident' Diana said. She sat down on the ground, having the perfect view of the lake. 'I didn't even know this lake was here' Tommy said while he sat down next to Diana. 'Most people don't' Diana started. 'Hopefully it will stay that way' Then Diana found her body moving closer to Tommy. She lifted her head so it met his, and softly placed a kiss on his lips. She could feel Tommy's hands sliding on her back, she could feel him returning her kiss and she never felt better. Diana had smiled the whole ride back to her house. This day had been absolutely perfect. Tommy had opened up more to her, talking about the Sparta tournament. It was nice to see him so excited about something. Diana made mental note to check if there were any tickets still available. She would love to see him fight, to see him in his element. As they were approaching her house Diana could see a silhouette of a man sitting on her porch. Diana's heart skipped a beat. Of course this evening had to be too good to be true… She quickly had to think of a way to convince Tommy that he had to drive another block, but it was already too late. 'Is there someone sitting on your porch?' Tommy asked suspiciously. He accelerated the car to reach to see who it was. 'I don't know' Diana mumbled. 'There is someone sitting on your porch' Tommy realized. 'Wait in the car' Instead of parking his car on her driveway he parked the car a few meters away from the house. 'No, please don't' Diana said, grabbing his arm to stop him of getting out of the car. 'Diana, you don't even know who that is' Before Diana could reply, Tommy was already out of the car, his hands balled up into a fist. Please don't do anything stupid … She couldn't let this happen. Yes, of course she wanted to see Mad Dog get his ass kicked, but what if it was Tommy who would get hurt, instead of Mad Dog. Diana hadn't forgotten Mad Dog was a very skilled fighter too. As quick as she could she got out of the car, but of course the stupid seatbelt had to be in her way. Tommy had already reached the house when Diana finally got out. 'What are you doing here?' She could hear Tommy say. 'I came to see her!' After what seemed ages Diana finally reached her house. She walked in front of Tommy and placed her hands on his chest. 'He isn't worth it' Diana told him fiercely. 'Baby, what do you mean I'm not worth it?' Mad Dog replied, a desperate tone in his voice. Like Diana expected he seemed drunk again. 'I'm not your baby' Diana shook her head in disgust. 'Please, just leave' 'But we called so often!' Diana's eyes met Tommy's, he raised his eyebrows. 'I never answered his calls' she tried to reassure Tommy. 'Yes we di-' 'SHUT UP' Diana cut Mad Dog off, now shouting. She didn't really know why she was shouted, either from panic or anger. 'Tommy, you can't believe him, you have to trust me' Tommy ignored what Diana said and walked towards Mad Dog. 'Don't ever speak to her again' he warned Mad Dog. Next he pushed Mad Dog away from the house. 'If you don't leave yourself, I'll make you leave' With reluctance Mad Dog started walking towards the end of the driveway, occasionally turning his head around to look at Diana. 'Tell me everything' Tommy demanded when Mad Dog finally left.[Chapter 13] \"Okay\" Diana nodded, even though there wasn't a lot she could tell him. \"Can we please go inside?\" Diana unlocked the door and went in, Tommy following her closely. She took off her jacket and sat down on the couch, waiting for him to do the same. \"Since Mad Dog has been thrown out of the gym he has been calling me\" Diana started, not sure why she was starting to feel guilty. \"We did not speak as often like he claimed. I talked to him once and after that I never picked up when he called. You have to trust me.\" \"What did he say to you?\" Tommy replied stiffly. \"He told me he was the best fighter and he needed to train for Sparta. He also told me that he hadn't drugged me on purpose, after that I ended the call. That's the only time I spoke to him.\" \"How did he get your number?\" \"I don't know!\" Diana replied somewhat annoyed. \"But you talked to him only once?\" Tommy narrowed his eyes and leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. \"Yes. I told you. I picked up because I didn't know who was calling me at first.\" Tommy was clearly angry. Diana knew he was trying to chance but she could still see the anger boiling inside him. She hoped he could control it, she hoped he wouldn't do anything stupid. \"You are not going after him, are you?\" Diana asked softly. Mad Dog was just as a capable fighter as Tommy, he could terribly hurt himself. \"You have to stay away from him. If he comes her again, call the police immediately\" Tommy said. \"You did not answer my question\" Diana realized. She stood up from the couch and stepped in front of Tommy, crouching down in front of him so she could look at him directly. \"Tommy, you have to promise me that you won't go after him.\" Tommy nodded slightly. \"I can't promise that.\" Diana noticed his hands curling up into fists. She sighed. \"You have to. I don't want you to get hurt, not with Sparta coming up. And besides, he is not worth it. He will not bother me again and if he will I will call the police, just like you said.\" She realized she had to talk him out of it. Tommy did not reply. \"If you are so determined to go after him, then I want you to leave. I do not want to feel guilty if something will happen to you. I don't want to be the reason why you could not fight.\" Tommy's eyes wandered off into the room and Diana could hear him sighing softly. \"Please, don't do it\" Diana added. \"Okay\" Tommy said finally. \"But I will go after him if he touches you. I have to.\" Diana nodded, realizing she wasn't going to get any more compromise than that. \"This day had started so perfectly\" she said absentmindedly. It was true, their time at the lake had been amazing. But of course Mad Dog had to barge in and ruin the moment completely. \"It can still end perfectly\" A soft smile formed on Tommy's face and Diana couldn't help but smile herself. He leaned forward and let his lips meet hers. Her hands cupped Tommy's face while she could feel his hands moving down to the small of her back. Carefully he picked her up and placed her on the couch opposite of him, moving on top of her. Diana let her hands trace his muscular back and she had to admit, this was a perfect way to end the day. It was past 11 when Diana and Tommy reached the gym. They both overslept this morning and had rushed to the gym immediately, knowing that Colt would be waiting for them. Secretly, she had woken up earlier than Tommy this morning, but she went back to sleep, resting her head on his chest. She couldn't bring herself to interrupt the moment. Diana went ahead and pushed the door open, already dreading what Colt was going to say. She had never been so late before, although she had to admit she did have a good reason this time. Colt was seated on top of her desk, already waiting for her. Tommy did not really have a specific time to come, she did have one. \"And why exactly are you late?\" he spoke, a little annoyed. She took a step forward to allow Tommy to enter. He greeted Colt and immediately left to warm up at the back of the gym, leaving Diana to handle the situation. After seeing Tommy enter, Colt raised his eyebrows and his mouth changed into a playful smile. Diana knew exactly what he meant and she simply nodded her head while smiling a little embarrassed. \"Well then…\" Colt said. \"I better start with him, if you haven't already worn him down\" Diana rolled her eyes and got seated behind her desk. Colt had always tried to set them up, so she couldn't really blame him for his remarks. The week went by so quickly. Diana could not have been happier. Every night she had spend with Tommy and every night became better. He seemed to warm to her, opening up every so often. Diana finally got the idea that she was really getting to know him. The fact that she got to watch Tommy train all day wasn't too bad either. She loved seeing him in his element and besides, she loved seeing him fight shirtless. There was no one she knew who was as muscled as he was. \"There is someone outside for you. A delivery guy?\" Steven said, a regular customer. Diana stood up from her chairs, figuring it must be the sports equipment they ordered last week. Quickly she took one last glance at Tommy before turning outside. I really have to stop staring at him… However, that proved a lot harder than she had thought. The delivery van was parked on the right of the parking lot. \"Hello?\" Diana asked. The delivery guy, who seemed to be filling in a form, turned around to face her. \"Hi\" he said once turned around. Diana's heart skipped a beat. \"I will scream if you touch me\" she warned. She couldn't believe her eyes. Mad Dog was standing right in front of her. They had not heard or seen him for over a week and to be honest, she had figured he had left town. Did he know that Tommy would practically kill him if he saw him? \"Oh no, please, don't scream\" Mad Dog extended his arm and as a reaction, Diana crossed her arms in front of her chest. \"Please, babe, just come with me\" \"No\" Diana replied fiercely \"If you do not leave right now, I'm calling the police.\" \"Don't make this so hard, come one, just leave with me!\" Mad Dog took a step forward. \"I'm going inside and I'm serious about calling the police.\" \"Is Tommy in there? Oh, I would love to take him on one more time. We could fight over you, the winner gets to keep you, the loser leaves town.\" Diana knew Mad Dog could actually be serious about this. She had to lie about Tommy. There was no doubt that Tommy actually would take on this challenge, figuring he would beat Mad Dog easily. \"He's not here. So, just go.\" Diana turned around to head back inside, hoping desperately to leave her alone. The door was so close, but still too far away. Mad Dog had already grabbed her arm before she could even reach the door. His fingers grabbed her wrist violently, undoubtedly leaving marks behind. Diana did exactly what she had told Mad Dog before, scream. She screamed as loud as she could, hoping that anyone inside had heard her. Her scream didn't last that long, as Mad Dog's free hand covered her mouth to shut her up. \"If you don't shut up things will get a little ugly from now\" he warned. Diana tried to free herself from him, kicking him with her legs. Mad Dog didn't seemed to be too impressed and twisted her arm on her back, making her squirm in pain. \"What do you want from me?\" Diana mumbled. Her words weren't that clear because of Mad Dog's hand. He uncovered her mouth so Diana could speak again. She seized the opportunity to scream again. Mad Dog was used to violence, there was no way she could hurt him enough to let her go. \"Bitch!\" Mad Dog cursed, immediately covering her mouth again. \"I have warned you that things will get ugly if you don't shut up!\" Roughly, he shoved her towards the van. The door was still standing open and with ease he picked her up and threw her inside. \"Let her go.\" Diana's head was pounding from banging it against the floor of the van. Was that Colt? \"And what are you going to do about it?\" Mad Dog said amused. Diana started to look around her to see if there was anything inside the van that could be of use, but her vision was so blurry she couldn't see a thing. The door of the gym swung open again and someone got outside. \"What happening here, Colt?\" Oh no, please Tommy just go away . The pounding in her head seemed to be going down a little and her vision also returned to her. Slowly, she peeked her head outside the van. \"Where is she?\" Tommy asked. Diana could clearly hear the anger in his voice. \"She is in the van, waiting for me to leave with her. She doesn't want you anymore\" Mad Dog replied. Diana wanted to shout that it wasn't true, but she couldn't make a sound. Is this a dream? Is this really happening right now? \"That's not true.\" \"It is, I'm sorry bro.\" Diana peeked her head a little further out of the van so she could see everything clearer. So she could see exactly what she had caused. If she never went out with Mad Dog in the first place, this would have never happened. Her eyes meet with Tommy's. She opened her mouth, trying to tell him to just leave her. Trying to tell her it was her own fault after all. But before she could say anything Tommy launched himself forward, his hand curled up into a fist, and attacked Mad Dog. Diana gasped out of surprise, even though she knew this was probably going to happen. Tommy's attacks were much more ferocious than in the boxing ring, anger was taking over. Mad Dog counter attacked, punching high and low to weaken Tommy. This had to stop. Diana would not allow that Tommy would hurt himself so badly he couldn't compete in the Sparta tournament anymore. Colt was trying to break off the fight, but both of them weren't having it. This could end very badly. Diana looked around the van one more time and discovered a pile of wooden planks in the back. Without thinking, she picked one of them up, surprised at how heavy they were, and swung at Mad Dog's head as hard as could. Her heart started racing once she saw Mad Dog lying on the ground. Was this the end? Breathing heavily, Diana eyes met Tommy's again. His face was bleeding and multiple bruises were beginning to form. \"Are you alright?\" he asked, stepping over Mad Dog's body to reach to her. \"Yes! Are you?\" His face looked even worse up close. \"I'll be fine\" he replied. \"Your face…\" Diana couldn't take her eyes off the blood on his face. I caused this. I caused this. I caused this . She could not push the thought away. \"The police is on their way\" Colt said, putting down his phone. He crouched next to Mad Dog to check if he was still breathing. \"Come on, let's go inside.\" Tommy took her hand and lead Diana inside. Diana looked behind her to take one last glance at Mad Dog, knowing that this was the last time she would ever see him. Author's Note: So, I bet you didn't think I would continue this story. I've got so many new fanfic ideas, but I have to finish the ones I already have first. This fic is on top of my list, so I hope I can get chapters out a lot faster than I do right now. Mad Dog will, for now, never make an appearance again. I had to find a way to 'end' him, as he was starting to annoy me, lol. As always, please review and I'll see you next time![Chapter 14] Diana had explained everything to the police. The stalking, the assault. They told her she had only knocked him out and they could issue a restraining order if she wanted to. She had nodded her head, agreeing it was for the best if he left town. Colt also made sure Mad Dog could not enter the Sparta Tournament anymore. It felt like a heavy load was lifted off her shoulders. No more worrying about him, ever. They had patched up Tommy and after questioning him they were allowed to go. Colt decided to give her the rest of the day off so they could go home to rest. This afternoon had taken a turn nobody had expected. \"Home sweet home\" Diana sighed happily as she opened the door, Tommy following her closely. It was relieving to know Mad Dog would never wait for her on her porch again. Tommy sat down on the couch and rested his feet on the coffee table, taking in a deep breath. \"Are you sure you're alright?\" Diana asked while opening the fridge to take out a couple of beers. They deserved a drink. \"Yes, I'm fine\" Tommy smiled softly. She handed him the bottle while sitting down next to him. Carefully she rested her head on his shoulder, making sure not to hurt him. She doubted whether he was really fine. Mad Dog gave him a good fight and he had taken quite a beating. The medic had stitched up a cut just above his right eyebrow and disinfected the rest of the little cuts. He also bruised a few ribs. Still she knew he was never going to admit it had hurt. \"Are you?\" Tommy put his free arm around her. He slowly put the bottle to his mouth to take a sip. \"I've never been better. Finally he is out of our lives and we never have to think about him again\" Diana replied honestly, also taking a sip. \"Are you sure he didn't touch you?\" Diana could see him recoiling at the though that Mad Dog might have touched her. \"Positive\" Diana smiled and lifted her head to give him a soft kiss. The next few days everything went back to normal. Tommy went back to train, albeit he trained a little less often since his ribs had just started to heal and Diana went back to work. She was looking forward to the Sparta Tournament. \"You know, we never really talked about your time in the corps anymore\" Diana tried carefully one day when they were walking to the bus stop. Tommy's car was at the garage and it just felt like the old times when Tommy used to walk her to the bus stop. \"There is not much to talk about\" Tommy replied bluntly. \"You were on the national news\" Diana tried again. \"That is hardly nothing.\" Tommy let go of her hand and slid it inside his pocket. She had hit a weak spot, but to be honest she was really curious to find out what exactly had happened. \"Maybe one day I'll tell you\" Diana couldn't help but notice how the ambience changed whenever she brought the subject up. It only made her more curious to find out what had happened. Maybe I could talk to his dad… \"Have you packed all your stuff?\" Tommy popped his head round the door to see if Diana was ready to leave. The days had went by so quickly and before she had realized, the Sparta Tournament had arrived. Their flight left in a few hours which gave them plenty of time to leave. Putting her final stuff in her bag, Diana replied: \"I'm ready!\" Tommy had been so excited for the tournament, never talking about anything else. It made her happy seeing him so passionate about something. Diana even had to admit she was beginning to feel a little bit excited too, although she was quite worried about him. His face had only healed up so much and there were still some cuts to spot around his face. It didn't seem to bother Tommy, in fact, Diana realized it made him more determined to win this thing, it was as if the fight had released some kind of energy in him. With one hand Tommy picked up Diana's bag before picking up his own bag with the other. They were taking the bus to the airport, so they would not have to deal with parking their car. Diana made sure the house was locked up and she had turned off all the lights. Before walking out of the door she took in a final breath, this was it, when they would return they would either return as winners or as losers. She didn't know what she wanted it to be. All this time Diana had not figured the tournament would be such a big deal, but she was clearly wrong. They were literally swarmed by media when they arrived at the venue. Both her and Tommy didn't really know how to deal with the press so they quickly hurried inside. \"Look at all the fighters\" Diana whispered when she let her eyes fall on Tommy's opponents. Tommy simply nodded. She probably figured he was already trying to find out their weaknesses so he could go into the fight prepared. \"Tommy, I have to take you, there are some reporters who want to talk to you about the video posted on YouTube\" Colt said, appearing from the back of the venue. \"I'll go to rest at the hotel\" Diana smiled before giving Tommy a kiss, realizing this would be the last time they could speak before his first fight. \"Good luck tonight, you can do it\" She reassured him. \"Thanks babe\" replied before giving her another kiss. \"Bye\" Diana managed to say before Colt quickly took Tommy away. She turned around to head out of the venue, figuring the media wouldn't pay any mind to her now she could get out of here quickly. Her thoughts seemed to be clouded with worries. What if he gets knocked out? What if his previous injuries are in the way? What if he breaks something? Diana had never been to a tournament like this before so she had no idea what the expect. She knew Tommy was capable in knocking people out in just one blow, but would he be able to do it tonight? \"Oh excuse me!\" Diana apologized. With all the thinking going on she was not watching where she was going and had bumped into one of the fighters. \"No worries\" the fighter said, placing his hand on her shoulder. \"Are you alright?\" \"Yeah, fine\" The fighter looked somewhat familiar, but she couldn't place his face. \"Who where you with just now? Was he a fighter?\" \"Who, Tommy?\" Diana asked. \"Yeah, he's a fighter. Maybe you'll have to fight against him?\" \"I hope not\" the fighter mumbled to himself. \"Look, I gotta go. It was nice meeting you.\" Once in her hotel room, Diana turned on the television to get a glimpse of what to expect later on. The fights itself didn't look so bad, but she could still feel her heart jump every time a fighter was knocked out of thrown on the ground. Tommy didn't have to fight until 10, which gave her plenty of time to shower and change outfits. She decided on a simple black dress she had found in a department store a week before. She wanted to look special but she did not want to overdress. After showering she pulled her hair back into a slick ponytail and left her make-up to a minimal, eyeliner and mascara was enough. As she was packing her bag to take with her, Tommy's mobile phone went off. She hadn't realized he had left it here. At first she was hesitant to pick it up, but to be honest she was kind of curious who was calling him while he was training. \"This is Tommy's phone\" Diana spoke into the phone. \"Who is this?\" A woman on the other side of the line said. She spoke with a Spanish accent. \"It's Diana, who is this ?\" Diana frowned, she had never heard this voice before. \"Could I speak to Tommy please?\" \"He's not here right now. Can I take a message?\" Diana replied, realizing the woman had dodged her question. \"No I'll call back.\" The woman had hung up. Slowly Diana lowered the phone from her ear to check the caller ID but that only displayed a number, not a name. A new worry came to her, to add with all her other worries. Who was this woman? Author's Note: A little shorter chapter this time. I wanted to story to follow the plot for a bit, but I haven't seen the movie in quite some time so I hope I got everything right, lol. I've left Tommy's father out for now but he will probably make an appearance somewhat later on. Enjoy![Chapter 15] Diana followed Colt inside the arena. In a few minutes Tommy was going to fight, and she was probably more nervous than he was. They sat down on the chairs right next to the boxing ring. She had a look around and saw that the place was packed. It seemed as if the whole world was tuning in to see this big tournament. The host announced the two fighters, one of which was Tommy. Her heart started to pound even louder when she heard his name. Her eyes fell on a figure standing near the hallway that lead back to the changing rooms. She recognized his immense frame immediately. On the opposite side of the ring, Tommy's opponent appeared. He jumped up and down, warming himself up for the fight. The guy looked about as big as Tommy, but Diana knew he could take him on. Next it was Tommy's turn to go in the ring. Unlike his opponent, he walked over to the ring as cool as a cucumber. He didn't even turn his eyes to the audience, but he kept his gaze in front of him as he focused. Diana had her breath as he entered the ring, but before she could release her breath, Tommy had already knocked out the opponent and left the ring without further ado. She stood up from her chair, just like the rest of the arena. Everyone shouted enthusiastically and roared for Tommy. His opponent still laid still in the middle of the ring. A medic came rushing to his side. \"Where is he going?\" she asked Colt. Normally the host would announce the winner, but Tommy had rushed out before the host could try. \"I'll go after him,\" Colt replied. Diana nodded. After the mysterious phone call she – or rather Tommy – had received, she was desperate to speak to his father, hoping he knew more about the situation. She moved out of the arena and went outside, letting the cool breeze hit her skin. Swiftly she retrieved her phone from her pocket and accessed the internet browser. She remembered the street he lived on and quickly she found the number. \"Yes?\" Tommy's father spoke when he answered the phone. \"Mr. Conlon? I'm Diana, we have met before?\" she spoke into the phone. She had seen Tommy's father some time ago when she was out looking for him. \"What ya want?\" he asked sternly. \"I received a phone call from some woman earlier and wondered if you knew something about it?\" she asked politely, not letting his stern attitude faze her. \"A woman?\" Mr. Conlon mumbled. \"A Latin woman?\" \"Might be, I only spoke to her a few seconds,\" Diana replied, trying her best to remember. \"Yeah, he had a buddy in the corps, I believe he died. He had a wife who he still is in contact with if I recall correctly.\" That did explain a lot. She never talked about his time in the corps with him. Whenever she tried to bring the subject up, either he changed it or left the room. Diana never knew what exactly had happened but now this mystery woman revealed herself, it only got even more complicate. Why was Tommy still having contact with her? Diana had to admit even though she only knew a fraction of the story, it made her jealous. It made her jealous in the fact that this woman knew something about his marine corps time that she didn't. Everyone was still in uproar when she entered the arena again. They could hardly believe someone knocked out a previous champion in one blow, but Diana knew what Tommy could do. She had seen it before. She was more surprised with him walking out of the arena without even looking at her, but she figured he was so in his zone he couldn't concentrate on anything else but fighting. She continued her way to the changing rooms. \"Hey,\" she greeted when she appeared in the door opening. Tommy was seated on a bench, packing up his things. Colt seemed to have left already. \"How are you feeling?\" \"Good,\" Tommy said, standing up to plant a kiss on her cheek. \"It wasn't much of a fight.\" \"The people loved it,\" Diana stated. \"There are a lot of reporters wanting to talk to you.\" \"Well, then they can wait for a long time,\" Tommy replied, wrapping his arm around her while he picked up his bag with his other. \"Let's go back to the hotel.\" It had taken Diana all evening to work up the courage to confront Tommy about the woman. She had no idea how he was going to react, as she doubted she was supposed to know about the existence of the woman. \"Tommy?\" she started carefully. She was lying next to him on the bed, her head on his muscled chest. Ice Road Truckers was on the television. \"Can I ask you something?\" \"Yeah,\" Tommy mumbled, his eyes fixed on the TV. \"I picked up your phone yesterday, and some woman answered,\" she started. \"Who is she?\" Tommy shifted his gaze towards Diana. \"You picked up my phone?\" he asked bitterly. \"Yes, it was ringing and I wanted to be nice and pick it up,\" Diana defended. She knew he was going to react this way. \"She's no one, Diana. No one you should worry about.\" \"Should I worry about you?\" Diana asked. \"You don't tell me anything Tommy, after all that we've been through. I know that woman is related to someone of the corps.\" Tommy sighed. \"Look, it's not what you think, okay?\" \"Then what is it?\" Diana wondered. For the first time ever, Tommy had told her the complete story. About how his buddy had died and how he still sends money over to his wife and kid. At first Diana was angry he had kept quiet about it, but after she let it sink in she realized it was actually a really kind gesture of him. It proved how much he did care about others, even if he sometimes didn't show it on the outside. Diana could hardly believe the next rounds of fights went by so quickly and so easily. Tommy fought his opponent with ease and before she knew it, he was placed in the final. The change of getting twenty million dollars was getting closer, but Diana cared none about that. The only thing she cared about was getting Tommy back in one piece. They were waiting in their hotel room to see who Tommy was going to be fighting in the final. The television showed a fight between two potential opponents, one of which was the guy she had bumped into a few days earlier. After a few minutes it became clear who had won, and Tommy didn't seem to be happy about it. Diana didn't see what the problem was, as she had been watching the guy closely and she and Colt agreed Tommy could take him on easily. But when Tommy spoke, another thing she never knew about him unraveled. \"That's my brother,\" Tommy spoke. Author's Note: So sorry for the long wait, I'm really trying to think of new storylines etc. plus I'm very busy with university and other stories. Anyway, tell me what you think and until next time![Chapter 16] \"You have a brother?\" Diana said, looking at the guy on the television. She remembered bumping into him a few days earlier, he seemed like a nice guy. They did look quite alike, she noted. But the fact that both did not share their last name made it difficult to guess they were brothers. Why had he never brought him up? Tommy nodded. \"I'll leave you two alone,\" Colt said, quickly escaping the tense atmosphere in the room. \"I thought we were done with secrets,\" Diana stated. She sat down next to him, looking him in the eye. \"I'm sorry,\" Tommy apologized. \"I don't have any contact with him.\" \"I can see that,\" Diana replied. Learning about this made her wonder what more there was she did not know about. She felt like every time she learned the truth about one thing, another thing unraveled. When would it end? \"We can't keep doing this.\" \"I don't like talking about this stuff,\" he said. \"You have to, Tommy. How can I understand what is going on in your head when you don't let me in. I want to support you, but I don't know how.\" Tommy seemed to be genuinely sorry, and Diana couldn't help herself but to forgive him. There was something about him she could not resist and she knew that was bad. \"It's all very complicated,\" Tommy explained. \"Well, you have until the fight starts to tell me everything.\" Diana could only hope getting these things of his chest would help him fighting, it sure did help her state of mind. Now she knew for sure all the secrets were out of the way. She knew everything about him and she was glad to know everything. She had told Colt a short summary of what Tommy had told her, excluding the details of course, so he could get a better view of what was going on with him. Fighting his brother would definitely bring up emotions, and Diana expected this fight to become a difficult one. She knew Tommy was physically superior to his brother, but would he be able to push away his emotions in order to win this? She was all tense when Tommy entered the ring. She tried to read his face, but he didn't let anything show. His brother appeared on the other side of the ring, surrounded by people. It was hard to guess who was more popular, as both received a roaring applause from the audience. Diana didn't even care anymore if they won or not, the only thing she cared about was getting the same Tommy back. Something inside told her things were about to change. And they were. Tommy acted very hostile towards his brother. Brendan tried to talk to him, but Tommy ignored him blatantly, immediately returning to his own corner. Once they were allowed to start, Tommy launched himself forward, punching Brendan in every way he could. Diana didn't know whether he really wanted to hurt him, or just wanted to punch his feelings away. Across the room, Diana spotted Brendan's wife, looking just as tense as she was. She wondered if she knew about the family history, or did Brendan keep it from her as well? It looked as if Tommy was overpowering Brendan. Diana clenched her fists when she watched him manically punching Brendan. She had never seen him so aggressive before. Even when the referee pulled them apart, he continued to punch Brendan once more, before retreating to his own corner, his body movements screaming anger. Diana felt sorry for Brendan, as she knew this contest was not about winning anymore. It was about finally fighting out their problems. They started again and still Tommy dominated Brendan. But Brendan started to fight back, harder. Diana didn't even notice she was standing, the world seemed to disappear around her. She only had eyes for the fight. The referee pulled them apart again and people had to contain Tommy as he was still launching himself at Brendan. Diana never knew how much this thing with his mother and brother had bothered him, but now it became clear how much exactly. It was as if all the feelings he had cropped up for so long, finally came to the surface, expressed in anger. And then Brendan was on top of Tommy, has arm locked in a tight grip. Diana gasped, as she could see Tommy was clearly in pain. A crack echoed through the ring. He had dislocated his shoulder, and badly. Diana wanted to run towards the ring, screaming to get them out of there as this could end badly, but Colt stopped her. \"It's going to be okay,\" he assured her. \"They need to work this out.\" Diana understood they needed to work it out, but so far they were killing each other. Brendan realized what he had done and wanted to help Tommy, but once again his anger had completely taken over him, and he responded by hitting him. They were pulled apart again and Diana wondered how he could continue while having dislocated his shoulder. \"He's in pain,\" she mumbled. \"He can handle it,\" Colt replied, but Diana saw he was worried as well. Tommy sat down in his corner, and for the first time in a fight, their eyes crossed paths. Diana mouthed it was going to be fine, that he could do it, but she could spot tears rolling from his eyes. The fourth round was announced and where other people would stop, Tommy continued. He stood up, basically ignoring his shoulder and readied himself to continue to fight. Brendan tried to say something, but Tommy motioned it was okay to continue. Brendan didn't want to fight anymore, but for some reason Tommy didn't feel like giving up yet. Diana admired his perseverance, but he had to stop, for his own safety. \"Tommy!\" she tried shouting but he could never hear her over the crowds. But since Tommy was still fighting, Brendan had to as well. Where once Tommy had the upper hand, now Brendan was dominating the ring. Diana felt a tear rolling down her cheek as well. It was now clear Tommy couldn't take it much longer. \"We have to get him out of there,\" she urged. \"Can't do anything about it anymore,\" Colt said. \"He has to tap out, otherwise the fight goes on.\" But Tommy didn't tap out, not yet. Both brothers were breaking down physically and emotionally. It wasn't until Brendan had him pinned down on the ground, when he finally tapped out. Diana felt a surge of relief coming over her. It was over. The fighting was done. No more hurting. Tommy didn't win the match, but that didn't matter anymore. He did win one thing – he won his brother back. AN: Next chapter will be the final chapter of this story. I feel like this story has come to an end and I just need one more chapter to wrap this up. Stay tuned and thanks for reading! ","Summary":" Tell me what you think about it! I normally do not write in this format, but I thought I'd give it "},{"Movie":"Reservoir Dogs","Title":"The Rat","Author":"OrangeReservoir","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10966764","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Ok, so this fanfiction is in a completely new area for me, but Reservoir Dogs is one of my favorite movies and I feel it is worth giving it a shot. If I am not doing the characters or the movie any justice, just let me know, because I already have a feeling this is going to fail miserably. To get to the point, this fic is based after the warehouse standoff between Joe, Nice guy Eddie and Mr. White, with the change that the police never catch them. Mr. Orange doesn't tell Mr. White that he is a cop, and instead he lets him believe that he was never the rat. Note: I do not own any of the characters. \"He was the only one I wasn't a hundred percent on. I should have my fucking head examined going in when I wasn't a hundred percent sure!\" The situation that he had dreaded stepping into this job had finally come true as he watched the three guns drawn and aimed at their intended targets. The weapon directed at him was held by none other than Joe, the leader of the operation, the man he was supposed to be 'bringing down'. Conversation was no longer just 'tense', it had escalated into a standoff that Freddy knew too well in his mind was going to end with one, or all of them dead. He should speak up now, he should save three lives and admit who he really was… he was going to die anyway, but he couldn't voice a thing. Cold sensations that covered his body, that caused his eyes to lose sight and his ears to ring were stopping him from making any noise, all he could do was watch the inaudible blurred argument as it continued above him. What is he doing? Why? There was such conviction in Mr. White's voice earlier, that held a high regard for this 'Mr. Orange', and it made him cringe to think that this man was turning against one of his oldest associates to defend the rat. Why would he do that? He didn't really know he was defending the rat, he thought he was saving the life of a new friend that was helpless against a swarm of false accusations. White was not going to back down, his gun still firmly aimed at Joe. \"Joe, you shoot that man you die next. You shoot that man, you die next\" \"Larry! It's been a long time, a lot of jobs. We've been through a lot of shit, you respect my father, I respect you, but I will put bullets in your heart if you don't put that fucking gun down now!\" White seemed to ignore Eddie's threat that was more like a plea for his father's life, focusing on Joe who now stood with his eyes fixed on Mr. Orange's stained and bleeding form. His hand tightened around the gun, finger pulling the trigger slightly closer to releasing all of the anger and hatred he felt. \"Goddamn you Joe, don't make me do this\" \"LARRY YOU STOP POINTING THAT FUCKING GUN AT MY DAD!\" The panic in Nice Guys Eddie's voice was drowned out by the deafening sound of gunfire , and Orange's body was thrown into the concrete that was already covered with his own blood, a second wound now in his chest. He closed his eyes hard and waited for the pain to set in as it had before but he felt nothing. There was only the sound of a scuffling pair of feet. Had someone survived? Mr. Pink, of course, the coward would have backed away from the fight. He opened his eyes, but was only rewarded with blurred vision of the skinny bastard that called himself a 'professional' fleeing. Another figure was moving towards him now, crawling across the bloodied ground to reach him with the last of his energy. \"Lar- Larry\" Freddy reached out a hand in search for comfort. His chest was in agony now, and with every breath he took the feeling of a building, foaming liquid in his lungs was enough to shatter all hope in his mind that he was going to survive. His entire body was faltering; he could feel the struggling motion of his upper torso causing his arms to twist inwards towards the source of pain, the heels of his leather shoes scraping along the concrete as he gasped for air and tried to make out words to his fellow man. He opened his mouth in attempt but could do nothing but choke on the blood that had pooled in his throat. \"Shh, don't talk\" The blunt words from Mr. White, to whom he had come to know as Larry calmed some of the anxiety he felt. A hand gripped his upper arm and shifted him to the side with as much care as it could muster, before pulling him upwards, into his colleagues lap. White's hand quivered in shock as he ran it across the side of Freddy's face in an attempt to soothe and quiet him, he had also been shot in the standoff, by none other than 'Nice Guy' Eddie, but seemed more concerned about his dying companion. \"Hey, shh, shh you're going to be alright\" He felt the younger man's jaw clench before he exhaled sharply through his teeth. Orange was dying, he could tell from prior experience that he had lost too much blood to survive. Why didn't you just take him to a doctor when he begged earlier? He got shot because of you, he is a good kid. The guilt plagued his mind, why did he care? He didn't know, but this man was different to others he had come across. He didn't hide his fear like most that White had met in earlier jobs; and the others that he had seen die had never suffered for as long as Orange had. Why are you still calling him Orange? \"What's your name kid? Breathe and tell me your name\" He choked again, trying to make words with what strength and life he had left. White ran his hands over the man's face again in an attempt to relax him enough so that he could speak, but the body he held in his lap could only writhe and let distressed huffs of air escape his lips. Orange's grip tightened on his suit sleeves as his legs began to kick outwards in pain…he was suffering. You have to do something…take him somewhere. He scoured his surrounds for answers before directing his attention to the door. If he could lift him out to Joe's car he might have time still to get him to help. He applied pressure to his own wound before pushing himself off the ground, and stumbling to where the man who planned the robbery, that at the time seemed well thought through, lay dead beside his son. He kneeled and searched for keys, scouring all of the pockets until his finger finally caught a key ring. He had a car, now he just needed a way to get Orange outside. The sudden and unexpected sound of hurried footsteps echoed throughout the empty warehouse and made Mr. White turn and draw his gun. Mr. Pink jumped slightly in surprise before scoffing at the sight in front of him. \"I thought you were a goner for sure\" There was a tone to his voice that didn't seem the slightest bit worried about the fact that two of the men he worked with were dying. And his impression of the man, right from the start had been that he was a snide, gutless prick. \"Eddie's car won't start, just my fucking luck could the day get any better\" The nervousness in Pink's voice increased when after looking in Joe's pockets, he found they were empty. The cop's would have to arrive soon if a rat had really set them up, and he knew that being caught was the worst possible scenario that the man in front of him could think of. He could use this to his advantage. \"The cop's will be here soon Mr. Pink. We are all going away for a long time…unless\" His body language changed instantly as soon as he figured out that White had the keys to his escape. \"You lift Orange out to Joe's car, I'll give you the keys if you swear you'll take the both of us to help\" Pink looked as though he was about argue or pull his weapon, when the sound of distant sirens could be heard approaching. Larry held his gun at the weedy figure that now panicked about the approaching wave of police, surely thinking over the proposal and making his decision. He ran towards Mr. Orange and with much difficulty, lifted him and began to drag him backwards towards the door. White kept his handgun held firmly in place, as he stood and tried his best to keep up. By the time he reached the door Mr. Pink had already succeeded in lifting Orange into the back of Joe's car. White pulled himself onto the seat beside the man, whose name he still yet wanted to find out and cradled his head once more, before closing the door behind him. A wave of relief ran over him when the car came to life and pulled away from its parked position, Pink speaking up as they escaped the sound of sirens successfully. \"I know a doctor that lives about twenty minutes from here. He will help you without alerting the cop's, but know that I ain't sticking around Mr. White, I'm putting as much distance as I can between me and this place\" White stared into the rearview mirror to meet Pink's eyes, who still seemed tense about their narrow escape. He didn't know whether to trust him or not, for all he knew the weedy fucker was the rat. Below him though, he could feel the gasping breaths of Orange. He needed to trust Mr. Pink, he wasn't going to let this young man die, not now. \"Just hurry up, I don't give a fuck where it is you take us so long as they can fix this mess up\".[Chapter 2] \"What the fuck are you doing, get outta the car and go knock on the front door like a normal person!\" \"Hey Mr. White how about you get out of the car and go and fucking knock yourself. I'm trying to help you here, do you want my help or not…we shouldn't be acting like this. We're fucking professionals\" Pink honked the horn another three times and waited for the door of 47 Corcoran St to open. They had been sitting in the car for five minutes and Mr. White was sick of the childish nonsense. \"I will go and fucking knock myself, and if I hear you say that we are professionals again I swear to god I will make you worse off than him\" In saying this he pointed at Orange, who had now passed out in the backseat that was now covered in both of their blood. He pressed against his stomach feeling a painful discomfort that was the bullet wound he received less than an hour ago. It was ridiculous, Mr. Pink, who had not yet revealed his true name, sat in the car and watched him stumble, blood covered to the front door of a stranger's house. He mumbled under his breath as he knocked and waited for the owner to answer. As the door opened it revealed a small thin boy that looked no older than 20. Well done Mr. Pink, well done. White felt himself sigh in disbelief and annoyance at the figure that stood in front of him, how in god's name was he going to be of any help? \"You a friend of Mr. Pink?\" The young man's face just scrunched up, until finally he shrugged his shoulders. \"Who is Mr. Pink?\" \"He is that Asshole out there in the front seat of the car\" He pointed to were Pink was sitting, tapping his watch and making hand gestures that he was sure nobody else understood. \"Him? Yeah I know him…I helped him out a little while ago. What does he want?\" \"My friend and I are both injured. He said you would be able to help us without barking to the cops\" He stood and thought about it for a minute, stepping backwards inside a little. \"What's in it for me?\" \"I'll pay you\" the response was quick and well taken. The boy in the door didn't have to think too hard about his decision. \"Ok, you get this 'Mr. Pink' to bring him inside…you going to need a bed for you friend?\" \"Most definitely, what's your name?\" \"Paul\" \"Good to meet you Paul, I'm Larry\" They both shook hands in the doorway, releasing only when they heard angered yelling from the car half parked on the front lawn of the unkempt house. \"Hey ladies! We done with introductions, come on hurry the fuck up I don't have all day!\" He could feel himself being dragged backwards, the heel of his shoe catching on the cracks in the pavement. He couldn't feel his arms completely, and the winded breaths he took shot waves of pain through his body that surged right to his toes. The man pulling him backwards was struggling to do so, but he found it too hard to open his eyes. Had the police finally come? Was he being rescued at last? He felt a rising hope that he was on his way to survival, a hospital, a doctor. But if he was being loaded into an ambulance by paramedics, why not on a stretcher? He pulled his numb arm closer to his chest and grasped the hand that was pulling him backwards. The man that was dragging him along was wearing a suit; he could feel it in the fabric. The small amount of faith that he still held wanted it to be Mr. White. \"Lar-\" He exhaled sharply, the pain escalating as he tried to spit out that one word. \"Mr. White? Please…he's probably inside having tea and fucking biscuits, while I'm doing his work for him. I didn't sign up for this shit\" Pink? No it can't be, he left with the diamonds. Freddy tried to open his eyes, confronted by the sunlight that dotted his vision. His sight cleared slightly, but was still blurred…it was Mr. Pink, it had to be, even with the unclear picture that his body provided he could make out the weedy man's distinctive facial hair. Why was Pink with him? Where was Larry? Did he come back to finish them both off just in case? He became panicked with the questions he provided himself and began to twist his body with what energy he had left in an attempted escape. \"What are you doing? I'm going to fucking drop you if you don't stop wriggling and White will kill me, so just hold fucking still alright Mr. Hero\" He gave up trying to fight, not because he believed him, but because he couldn't bare the pain of making more movement, Mr. Pink was the last person he was expecting to find helping him. Freddy heard a creaking sound, a door perhaps, swinging open. The light changed from the bright sun outside, to a cooler, more shaded orange glow; he was indoors. The grip on his arms loosened as he was laid on the floor. He tried to look around but his eyes weren't adjusting as they should have leaving him with only sound to rely on. He closed his eyes and ran his hand over the timber wood, tracing he grain with his fingers. \"Mr. White, honestly give up, look at him, he's a mess. I don't think that he is coming back from that, Joe got him good that second time around\" \"Mr. Pink, I appreciate you helping us out, I really do. But I would appreciate it more if you just left now, take your diamonds, and your negative opinions, and just hit the road before the cop's catch up with you\" Mr. White's voice was full of annoyance, but the thanks also lingered in his tone. \"Well then, Larry, it was nice knowing you. And kid, if you get through take care, you weren't half bad\" Mr. Pink tapped his shoulder slightly before the sound of the screen door opening was heard again. Silence followed for a few moments afterwards, until he felt the hand of who he guessed was Larry brush his hair from his forehead. \"Come on Orange, stay awake, you're going to be alright\"[Chapter 3] Before I get this chapter started I just want to say a big Thank You to VirendraLione for the positive feedback that I was given for this fic. I really appreciate the encouragement! \" Larry, Larry please!\" The muffled cries that sounded from down the hall where Orange had been taken, by this 'friend' of Mr. Pink, had been continuous for twenty minutes. He was trying to hold himself together, but the pool of blood that had formed around where he sat was slowly increasing. He hadn't moved; he couldn't move. The pained cries grew louder as a door was flung open, followed by the heavy sound of rapid footsteps. \"You're Larry aren't you, come on man he needs you, he is freaking out down there\" The voice was full of anxiety, a sincere worry strewn across the young man's face. He stood over the top of him for a moment before kneeling beside Larry and placing a hand on his shoulder. \"Hey man, are you alright? ...Larry, are you awake?\" He couldn't make out whole words, instead letting out a small grunt in reply. The young man, whose name had escaped him already, wrapped an arm underneath his own and tried to lift him. \"Come on, bend your knees and try lift, I can't hold you up on my own\" He listened and pulled his legs up under himself, before he was re-adjusted in the hands of the boy offering him help. There was no pain when he moved, when he drew breath. He felt nothing but a hollow feeling in his lungs and stomach, like a churning that wouldn't cease. \" Mr. White! Please Larry!\" He lifted his head in response to the call of his name, not noticing he was nearing the opened door in which the noise was ringing from. Ringing? Yes ringing. A high pitch sound that echoed in his ears so loud he wanted to close his eyes and die right then and there. He was sure he was going too eventually, and now he finally understood what Mr. Orange had meant earlier in the car. The blood was scaring the shit out of him too right now, it covered his hands, his arms and he was almost positive that it had drenched every inch of his suit. \"Here, look, you sit right here Mr. White ok, right there next to your buddy while I try fix him up. I gotta clean him up first ok, then I'll help you out as well just stay with me\" He could feel himself being lowered down into a chair, not a solid chair, it was more flimsy. He took a better look seeing that this 'chair' was more of a stretcher, situated beside the bed in which Orange was laid out in a contorted manner. He lay down; taking full advantage of the space he was provided with, grasping his dying friend's hand that hung blood-covered over the side of the mattress above him. The light didn't want to change for him, remaining red. All of the other cars around him seemed to move but he found himself stuck firmly in place. Was leaving the right thing to do? White and Orange had both taken a bullet for the diamonds that he was now escaping with. No, no, don't get guilty now, it was their fault they got shot, they should have watched their own backs. What are you going to do with diamonds? Sell them? Where? He had no idea what he was going to do, even if he did skip town, word that stones of that price had been stolen would have spread across the country by now. Leaving is what the cops would be expecting you to do; they probably have every main exit out of the city blocked. Shit. He turned around and looked at the bag in the back seat that contained the robbery's loot. The blood smeared over the leather made him cringe. Mr. Orange and Mr. White were dying because of the trouble of the contents of that bag, and he was running with it. They deserved a share, he probably wouldn't have gotten out alive without the distraction of the others. No, fuck you, you're going soft. You got the diamonds; therefore they belong to you and you only. He turned and looked at the road ahead, and as the light changed to green he found that his decision was still not firmly made, what if he did get caught, he would go away for a long time. Maybe he would be better laying low. He sat at the light and watched it change back to orange, then red. Orange. The poor kid, first ever real robbery and it goes that badly. The person situated behind him sounded as though they were banging on their car horn over and over in a fit of rage. He looked into his rearview mirror at the gestures he was receiving from the man , I doubt he would be doing that to me if he knew I tagged two cops earlier…. He reached for his gun, tempted to give this asshole the fright of his life, before coming to his senses. Patience , why couldn't the guy behind have a little patience, surely he wasn't in that big of a hurry. Missing one green light is not the end of the world. That's when it dawned on him. Was he in a hurry? He could have just ditched the car and stayed at the house with his two injured chums, nobody would find him there. The light turned green once again, and instead of heading straight, Pink found himself turning the car back the way he came, cursing his own judgment. Now you have to share the dough with the other two, you could have been fucking rich, well done genius. Sorry about how short this chapter is, I will be sure to post another in the next couple of days to make up for my lousy word count. If you have time, please review, I would love the feedback![Chapter 4] I am so sorry!, my computer died because my pet rabbit chewed the charger cord and I had to go out and buy a new laptop. Anyways I am sorry again for the delay, I hope you enjoy the chapter, and please if you have any issues just PM me. Review if you have time! He pulled the car to a stop and reached for the satchel containing the diamonds, making a noise similar to that in which a teenager who didn't get their own way would make, before climbing out of the seat. Ditching the vehicle was part of the plan, now all he had to do was walk the eleven blocks back to Paul's house. His footsteps echoed as he strode down the narrow lane towards the main road, and already he was regretting parking this far away due to the discomfort his shoes were causing. How did the whole plan get that out of hand, something so perfectly organised? He contemplated the events that had occurred earlier in the day and was stumped. There was no way that Mr. Blonde was the rat, as he had said to Larry, the psycho was too homicidal. Mr White? No way, he and Joe went back too far in the business together, there is no way he sold him out. Brown, Blue? Possibly, but who really knows, can't ask them now they're both dead. Then there was Joe and Eddie, he didn't want to believe they would ever set up their own men, but the way that the pinned the blame on Mr. Orange. Gut instinct? Nah, I don't buy it. Orange seemed like a good kid, he took a bullet, he was dying. If he were the cop would he have waited to be found? Hell no, he would have called his people to come and get him for sure. No sane person is going to sit back for that long and let themselves die. He had no idea, no rational explanation for what happened, but whatever had happened, he believed that the two men he was returning to had nothing to do with it. How was he going to explain? How was he going to tell Larry that he was a cop? He lay there in silence while a young man unknown to him wrapped his wounds, brooding over the questions he presented himself. \"How'd you get shot?\" The unexpected question offered him with the vision of the woman in the car. Immediately he felt a pang of guilt strike him, she had a baby. He didn't want to have to hurt anyone but as soon as he felt the impact from her gun he had to pull his own, it was instinct. \"I got shot trying to hijack a car, our day didn't really go as planned\" \"I can tell, what's your name?\" He almost said Freddy before stopping himself. \"My name is Mr. Orange\" \"Mr. Orange, Mr. White and Mr. Pink huh? What are they like code names?\" \"We weren't supposed to reveal our real names\" \"I can respect that\" He reached out a hand to shake \"My name's Paul, but you can call me Mr. Purple\" He snorted at the joke. \"Mr. Pink wanted to be Mr. Purple, don't tell him he might get bitter\" They both chuckled, and a third voice joined in. He didn't know how long Larry had been awake, but was glad to hear him share laughter. \"Did you tell Paul why he was called Mr. Pink?\" Freddy leaned over the side of the bed and saw Mr. White's eyes were still closed, but a large grin covered his face. \"Don't think about uttering another fucking word. I just walked eleven blocks for you assholes, I got blisters and everything, ok. Not to mention the fact I was carrying a bag of fucking stolen diamonds down a busy street.\" They all turned to face him shocked. \"Mr. Pink?!\" \"Don't 'Mr. Pink' me you little prick\" Every single person in the room fell silent for a moment. Why the hell would Mr. Pink come back? \"Why did you come back, weren't you trying to get out of town?\" Mr. Whites question caused Mr. Pink to raise his eyebrows. \"I was, but the place is crawling with cops, I don't think I would have ever made it out of the city, I reckon they would have had the entire thing blocked off\" \"Oh yeah, or was the real answer that you got guilty?\" \"You wish, I'm just looking out for myself here ok, you two…\" He gestured towards both of the men that had been injured \"don't mean shit to me. But since I came back I figured you both might as well get your share of the loot.\" Freddy felt gratified, Mr. Pink had a soft spot that he was sure never existed, and from where he was seated he could tell that Mr. White was thinking the exact same thing. \"Well Mr. Pink, whatever your reasons are for coming back, I must say I'm happy to see you\" \"Yeah yeah, cut the crap both of you and go to fucking sleep. You look horrible.\" With that he left the room and walked down the hallway to the kitchen. Mr. White just huffed and laid back down on his bed, it was a strange moment…Pink came back. Was it really guilt, like Larry had said? He followed Larry's actions and made himself comfortable also, he knew that he looked terrible, he had to. He felt completely hollow still, as he had earlier when he was nearly drained of life in the warehouse. The warehouse. For a moment he had pushed that thought to the back of his mind, but it was slowly creeping back. He would eventually have to tell Mr. White and Mr Pink who he really was, but how, how could he do that to them? They trusted him now, and he almost felt a brotherly connection with them both. It was silly to even think that, but the more he thought about it, the weeks leading up to the robbery had made him feel that there were people who cared about him. Mr. White had watched over him, so much that he took the life of an old friend in attempt to keep him safe; and Mr. Pink…well he had just returned with diamonds that could have made him rich, so that he could split the money between the three of them. He hadn't felt that good, that well in a long time. He turned the ring on his finger as he closed his eyes, maybe he didn't have to tell them at all?[Chapter 5] He sat and stared at the 60's style television in front of him, the black and white picture jumping every few minutes due to the lack of quality. It was all over the news, the diamonds were a big deal. So were the surviving culprits that had fled from the rendezvous point. His cereal had gone bad in the time he had been watching the news programs on various channels, each and every one showing the same story. It had to be a set-up, everything about its fishy. The footage of the aftermath showed the destruction that they had caused on the interior of the building. Mr. Blonde really was a psychopath. Blood was pattered all over the glass at the front of the diamond wholesalers, and even though the picture quality wasn't great, Pink could make out the unmistakeable pools of red in the carpet. He didn't really want to think about it, Joe should have never put a moron that trigger happy on the job. They were all capable of working together, but Blonde…he was just fucking insane. It was then that a female officer stood poised on the screen in front of him, her eyebrows furrowed. She spoke with such surety about the way that their plan was executed, where they fled, how many of them there was… \" We have been led to believe that there are three perpetrators still on the run, sketches taken from witnesses at the scene of the crime show two unidentifiable men, one aged between thirty and forty and the other in his late twenties. A prior offender known as Lawrence Dimmick is also believed to be a part of this shocking crime that left nine people dead and four injured….\" Larry He felt his heart stop, they were going to be found for sure. With every breath his chest became tighter, there was no way to escape it this time, the police…everyone was on high alert. The cereal slipped from his hands, the glass bowl smashing on the timber surface. You have to get out of here now, you haven't told them you're name yet. The cops wouldn't be able to identify you with just a drawing… But how? How did they know who Larry was, how did they get his name? Shit none of this makes any sense. \" If you have any information on the whereabouts of these three men a reward will be issued to anyone with evidence that could lead to their incarceration…\" Fuck \"Larry!... Larry!\" The distant shouting woke him from where he had fallen asleep earlier. The chairs cane build leaving imprinted patterns in his skin. What do you want now? For the past three days since their arrival at Paul Torisi's house, Mr. Pink had been battering him with information that the cops had released in relation to the heist. Important details that they 'apparently' would not have been able to find without aid; still hell-bent on the idea that there was a rat amongst them from the very beginning. \"Holy fuck White, it's really bad, they have pictures of you broadcasted all over the fucking television\" Pink was breathless, a look of fright and horror on his face that Larry had not yet seen; fright that had not surfaced when the robbery went wrong, not even when they heard sirens from inside the warehouse and made their narrow escape. \"Mr. Pink, breathe. Start from the beginning\" \"They have fucking photographs of you on the national news, along with your name, previous offences all of it! We are getting caught for sure this time Larry, we can't make an escape when every second person on the street knows who you are!\" What did he mean, his name? His…actual name? No, there is no possible way that they had his real name. The look in Pink's eyes said otherwise however and left him sitting speechless. \"How did they get my name?\" \"I don't fucking know how they got your name, but your picture is accompanied by very realistic sketches of both Orange and I, and I feel really fucking uneasy about the whole situation!\" Beside him Mr. Orange stirred when the angered Mr. Pink raised his voice. The boy had a rough few days; on and off fevers, severe pain, all accompanied by nausea. He didn't want his sleep to be disrupted, he needed it. There was a sense of déjà vu as he ushered the scrawny man away from where the Orange slept into the hall outside. \"Hey, you… get out there\" The words were blunt, but it was all he could manage as he tried his best to lift himself from the low-set chair. He was soon standing, but not without a grunt of discomfort. Small steps… He concentrated on his every movement, leaning against the wall hoping that it would take most, or some of his weight. Mr. Pink seemed panicky about the circumstances, pacing back and forwards as Larry entered the passage. \"What are we going to do Larry? What is going to happen if they find us, we might get pinned with the murders, and the dead cop…you will go away for Joe and Eddie. Orange, you said that he shot a civilian. Don't forget he killed Blonde, we are all screwed!\" \"Hey, its fine, we'll take off away from here and travel across state. I know somebody who could get us what we need to get out ok, don't worry Mr. Pink\" \"Worry? Worry? I don't think the word worry could even be used in this situation! I am not worried I am fucking freaking out here!\" His hands trembled wildly as he said this and his knees looked ready to buckle. \"You need to sit down\" He looked Larry in the eyes before pressing his back against the wall and making himself seated on the hallway floor, placing his face in his hands, before running them through his hair. He could see that he was struggling with the situation, the idea of being caught and locked up. \"Look Mr. Pink, it won't be permanent, we all just need to lay low for a few months or so ok. The authorities will forget about the whole ordeal soon enough, and for you and Orange, it was just sketches they can't prove anything from that\" His words seemed to reassure the crumpled figure who now stared blankly ahead at the empty wall. \"What will happen to you Mr. White? Where will you go, how are you going to get away from this?\" \"The truth is that I have done it before, all you got to do is stay below their radar. No reckless driving or endangerment of lives and they won't even notice you there\" Mr. Pink still seemed conflicted about the whole thing, but less anxious. He had most likely never been in a job that had gone wrong, everyone is scared when they're job goes wrong for the first time. \"Pink, right now we need to stick together and stay where we are. When we are all fit to leave we will get out of here and find a safer place to hide out until it blows over\" The man who had kept his barrier up at all times finally let out a sigh. He seemed lost, who knows what life he had to return to, a wife? Kids? Maybe it wasn't as simple for him to leave. The conversation topic suddenly changed as Mr. Pink peered around the doorframe and into the room where Orange was situated on the bed. \"How is Orange doing today, is he better?\" Seeing concern from him was something Larry never thought would happen, but the way that he spoke revealed a tone of voice that held a large amount of care. \"He hasn't woken up since yesterday morning, and even that was brief. But it seems that with some rest it will be fine, he's not going to die on us, but he's in an incredible amount of pain still\" A grimace came over Pink's face as he began to rise from the floor. \"Listen, you look really tired Larry. I think it would be best if I didn't worry myself by the shitty old television. I'll sit with Orange, you rest for a little while, you can take my room\" His instinct was to decline the offer, but he had been deprived of sleep since they arrived. \"You know what Mr. Pink, I will take you up on that, and you will wake me if he stirs, because if you don't I will be really fucking pissed\" With that the thin man chuckled slightly before stepping into the room. \"You know Larry, even though this job turned into a fucking catastrophe, I'm glad I got out of it with a couple of new friends\"[Chapter 6] \" Orange you know that we can't do that, look at you, you don't need the hospital you're perfectly fine\" He had been awake for two hours, and in that time his temperature had spiked, the dull pounding in his head now a drilling pain. He wanted a hospital, there was no safety here in the dark room, and the unfamiliar surroundings didn't reassure him at all . Where's Larry? \"Pink, please…I won't tell them anything…\" Mr. Pink simply lit a cigarette, and his anxiety was shown clearly when he respired erratically, throwing the smoke into the air in large uneven waves. He lifted himself from his chair and walked towards the doorway, before disappearing around the corner. Freddy looked down towards his chest, where the second bullet fired by Joe Cabot had met its mark, the slowly bleeding wound seeping through the bandages. The sight of his body and the injuries he had received, that were now surely killing him, were overwhelming. Don't fucking cry. He threw his head back down onto the pillow and stared at roof, before a hand grabbed his own. Larry stood over him with a saddened grimace, Pink not far behind. The tension in his throat increased, making him want to spill all of the emotions he felt to these men who were now his friends, but he couldn't make words. \"You don't have to talk, you just need to listen. I don't want to take you to a hospital, because I don't want to see you get locked up. And I know that you feel scared Ora-\" \"Stop… stop\" \"Don't interrupt I'm tryi-\" \"Stop Larry. I don't care about jail, I won't say anything to the cops, I just don't want…\" He choked again before continuing \"I don't want to fucking die\" Every sob that followed was like having someone press a branding iron to his chest, a burning so intense that he couldn't even draw breath. Larry gripped the collar of his shirt and pulled him closer into a tight embrace. \"You know that I can't do that\" He had to leave the room, it was unfair. Poor fucking kid is going to die for sure… He lit the last cigarette in the packet as he walked down the hall towards the kitchen. The radio was playing faintly in the background as their host diced the vegetables for dinner, and like the last 4 days, the media was still raving on about the heist, and the escaped suspects. \"Can you please turn that fucking shit off Paul, its doing my head in, I can't even watch the T.V without being bombarded with headlines about those fucking diamonds\" Paul looked him in the eyes before changing the channel. \"He isn't doing well is he?\" The smoke of both of their cigarettes filled the small room as Pink seated himself at the dining table. \"Larry just wants the kid to be alright, you know. But I think we all know that he isn't going to be, and the whole situation is so fucking unfair but we can't take him to a hospital. It's too risky\" \"What do you mean?\" \"What do you mean, what do I mean\" \"The risky part\" \"Larry and I might get caught\" The silence that followed was full of tension. \"Does that really matter? Yeah there's a possibility of being caught but at least you'll go to jail with a clear conscience knowing that you didn't let him die. I dunno, I'm not an expert, but I think it's pretty damn selfish\" It was true. It was selfish, but he had worked too hard throughout his life to risk it all and give up now. No fuck this, you're not being selfish you're just doing your job. \"It's just a job, Paul. You meet people that don't deserve what happens to em', and sometimes things don't work out, but you have to just toughen the fuck up and move on\" An expression of disbelief overshadowed the man's face, and he turned to face the cooking pot once more. \"But this man's not just a co-worker, he's a friend\" Friend…the word stuck itself in his mind. He never did have friends. But he had said it himself earlier that day, he had really come out of this job closer to these two men than he had been to anyone in a very long time. \"What do you suggest we fucking do then?\" Paul stared at his feet for a long while before answering the question. \"I suggest you and White pack up and hit the road. Find yourself a car and get out of town. I'll take Orange to get help, say I found him, don't know nothing about no robbery, only what I've seen on the news. If they want to check the house, let them, they won't find anything…\" \"Yeah, but what if you get arrested\" \"I'd rather get arrested than let that man die, and know I could have saved his life\" \"I agree with Paul, Mr. Pink.\" The third person joining the conversation startled the pair. He turned to where Larry stood hunched in a pained way against the wall, with obviously reddened eyes. \"Mr. White? What changed your mind?\" \"What changed my mind? Sense… and knowing that the dying man in the room over has a young wife to go home too\" Pink felt his chest tighten, the weight of the information he had just received crushing him. \"Fuck…\" Lies, that was all he could tell. Lie after Lie after Lie. A wife? He had never been married, but the ring that he wore on his finger as a part of his false persona had just changed Larry's mind. Why did he tell a lie to someone who trusted him so much, someone who saved his life? Because he was desperate, and even though the two men were doing what they thought was right, by keeping him hidden and away from the police, they were killing him. Don't feel guilty, you need to survive…so that you can try your hardest to lead the cops away, and give them a false scent to follow.[Chapter 7] I just want to apologise for not updating sooner! I've had this chapter finished for a couple of days, but I haven't been able to access my account, I'm not sure if it was just me or whether everyone was effected. Anyways here it is! Chapter 7, I hope you enjoy and hopefully I will be able to get the next chapter up by this afternoon. Thankyou for all of the reviews and follows too, you guys are amazing! He could feel his heart beating strongly as he peered once more from the blinds, separating the thin plastic sheets to get a better view of the street. \"It's all clear…\" Immediately Larry swung open the front door, and Paul lifted Orange from where he was laid on the couch. He felt himself rush to the young man's aid, taking some of the weight. Man he's heavy. The uneven pathway caused him to stumble more than once on the way to the small car parked on the curb, and it dawned on him that this was the last time he would probably see the kid. A sick feeling grew in his stomach, are we doing the right thing? \"Keep moving Pink, come on faster, we don't want to get seen here by the neighbours\" Pink lifted Orange's legs into the back seat of Paul's car, bending them slightly to evade the closing door. He could feel White standing above him. You have to give him a moment to say goodbye, after all, he did give up everything to save him…. \"You stay here for a moment Larry, I'll go get the rest of our things from inside.\" He ran back up the path into the house and retrieved his wallet and jacket, as well as White's roll of cash that he found stashed in his trouser pockets. Why do I feel so guilty? It's not like we forced him to go, he has wanted to go to a hospital since he first got shot, if anything we are doing what's best for him. But what if he gets the blame for all the dead cops…what if they charge him for shit he didn't do? Nothing was ever this hard in this job, no decision that he had ever made was as difficult as leaving this kid behind… but why, what made him so damn special. He didn't know, but there was something about Orange that was different than the others on the job, even Mr. White didn't have as much of an effect. He pulled his comb from his pocket and fixed his hair in the hallway mirror before pulling the front door open again. As he made his way down the path he could see that the car was already gone, and Larry had seated himself on the front gutter. That's it then… Mr. Orange was gone, and he didn't even get to say his goodbye. \"We did the right thing Pink…now let's get moving\" He stared solemnly at his feet for a moment, the feeling shared between them being one that was both uncomfortable and unsettling. \"Did we do the right thing, Mr. White?\" He pulled the car into the ambulance bay at the hospital and sat for a moment taking in deep breaths . They're going to ask questions…but that's ok because you don't know nothing, you found him like this… The story had so many holes in it, it had been four days since the diamond heist went wrong, how could he have just found him now? Orange wouldn't have lived four days on his own. What about… he sat and went over the possible stories he could tell to the police, to the hospital staff, a tale that would sound believable, but wouldn't tie him to the actual job. He pulled the rear-view mirror downwards so that most of his own reflection was visible. \"I don't know anything about the guy, I was told to call him Mr. Orange. Two of his buddies dropped him off at my house a few days ago and split, I don't know why they came to me, but when my father was alive he was involved with all of that mobster kind of…gang? Scene. So when he was dragged into my house I figured that it was guys Dad used to know when he was still in the business…\" Yeah that's good, you can start off with that, just make up the rest how hard can it be? He stepped out of his car and jumped up and down on the spot readying himself for the chaos that was going to follow, before sprinting in the direction of the emergency doors . You have to make it believable… \"Help! Help me please!\" He waved his hands as he ran across the almost empty carpark and was relieved when he caught the attention of two paramedics that were standing just inside the doors. He quickened his pace and made it to the buildings front steps before kneeling on the ground breathless. A hand gripped his shoulders and pulled him upright, before another staff member who looked like she worked at the desk held his arm to keep him from falling again. \"Help please I have a man, he's hurt real bad\" \"Ok keep breathing, now where is he son?\" Paul pointed at his car that was minuscule in size amongst the various ambulance vans, and in doing this more than five employees, that seemed to appear out of thin air, ran towards where Orange was sprawled in the back seat. The woman who had helped him squeezed tightly on his arm before ushering him inside. \"Come on inside and take a seat, I'll make you up a cup of tea or coffee and you can just relax, ok. I'm sure your friend will be fine. Now, do the police need to be called, how was this friend of yours injured?\" \"He's not a friend, I don't even know this man, but he's been shot more than once, I think that calling the cops is a good idea\" With that the woman, or 'Pam' as her nametag stated, ran towards a telephone and began to dial… This is it … The sound of a fist knocking on his door woke him from the sleep that he had fallen into; he pinched his nose before sitting up straight in his chair, I don't want to deal with no more of this bullshit. He hadn't slept for days, everything had gone so wrong and in a sense he felt responsible, but the whole goddamn Police Precinct was riding his ass and asking constant questions about the case that even he didn't know the answers to. \"What do you want now? I told you this morning I'm working on it, ok I don't know where-\" The door was pushed open by a uniformed officer who looked drained by the news he was carrying. \"Detective Holdaway Sir! They found him, they found Freddy…\"[Chapter 8] Eyes glared at him from all directions, eyes of judgement, and eyes that seemed to feel the same pain he felt. He wanted to get onto his knees and thank god that they had found him, and yet as he ran through the hall that was full of sick and mourning people he knew this was no place for joy. Freddy was either seriously injured, or he was dying, and he didn't want to think about the possibility of either. As he rounded the corner, the office for the emergency unit came into view. A woman standing at the desk taking calls seemed to be expecting him as he walked past. \"Sir, sir you can't go in there- \" He pulled his badge from the pocket of the jacket he was wearing. It gave him no real power here, but it was worth a shot. He pushed his way through the heavy doors and blocked out the woman that called after him. Come on Freddy, be alright man. As he walked he searched the windows for any sign of him, all he wanted was to know was that he was alright, or at least going to live. The lights were dim in the hall, and nurses rushed from door to door to try and aid their dying patients. The sound of loss could be heard in that single flat continuous beep that seemed to ring in every second room, and immediately he could feel his pace quicken. It was like a maze, it seemed impossible to find him amongst all of the chaos. He continued on until finally he came across a room with a young man standing leaning against the glass . That's the first person I have seen the entire time I've been in here… He was hunched forward, hand against his chest and another over his mouth, eyes closed firmly as the sound of a flat line echoed from the room he stood in front of. Poor kid… He slowed down, and tried to keep his head low as he passed but couldn't help glancing quickly through the open blinds. The body on the table was limp, with one hand hanging down over the side in a lifeless manner. The man's face was turned away from Holdaway's sight, but he recognised that haircut anywhere… No The doctor bought down his hand forcefully on the man's chest, and nurses ran to give him assistance. Everything seemed to happen so slowly, like the world had stopped, that was until his view was blocked. One of the staff had closed the blinds. He sat down, the same whirring tone loud in his ears. His hands found his face as he managed to enclose his expression from the rest of the world. No, this isn't happening… \"Hey…\" The hand that shook his shoulder did so gently, aware of the thoughts running through his mind. \"Hey, you're a detective right?\" He pulled his hands away from his face and stared into the glassy eyes of the young man, who looked as though he was only in his twenties. \"I was told you would be coming down, I'm Paul\" He extended a hand that he met with his own, the greeting solemn and full of grief. He didn't feel a need to talk, he just wanted to sit and be allowed to process what was happening. \"Look I really need to speak with you, I had nothing to do with it-\" The door swung open and two nurses removed themselves from the room holding their hands to their chests as they made their way down the hallway, leather shoes clicking as the soles hit the floor. A large man followed, removing the gloves from his hands and turning to both of them, who were now seated waiting for the news to be delivered. \"Look, he is alive for now but it's not looking great. We won't definitely know if he is going to survive for at least another twelve to twenty-four hours. Our best nurses are watching him and they will be monitoring his vitals very carefully…\" \"Can we see him?\" \"I really don't think tha-\" \"Doctor please, I don't expect him to talk back to me, I just want to see him with my own eyes\" The doctor looked at him, before finally nodding slightly and opening the door. \"Just don't touch anything\" He pushed his way through the door into the room and felt immediately shocked by the state in which his friend had found himself. The jungle of wires, tubes and fluids that surrounded the top of Freddy's bed hung low to the floor, and as he moved closer it took all of the concentration he could muster to avoid catching them with his feet. \"What did they do to you Freddy…?\" He grasped his friends hand in his own and squeezed it softly waiting for an answer but there was none. His skin was cold, and his face was pale, he could have been a ghost. He was startled from his own thoughts by the other person in the room that he hadn't noticed come in. Mr. Pink said there was a rat, and he was right. Paul watched as the detective entered the room where Orange was being kept and made his way towards the opposite side of the bed. Since he had arrived, this man 'Holdaway' was interested in one thing, the welfare of his 'buddy', his 'pal'. Orange is the filthy cop that ruined the diamond store heist. It didn't take him too long to figure it out, no officer was ever that worried about a criminal. He felt shattered, betrayed by this man who played the cards so well, and kept his cover hidden despite the circumstances. Keep calm Paul, you want this detective to believe you had nothing to do with it…make conversation. \"So, is he friend of yours? You seem pretty close to him, the way you came running down the hall before.\" The man turned to face him, seemingly shocked that there was another person in the room, he mustn't have known. \"This man, this man right here is incredible. Nobody goes missing for four days and comes back to us alive. Not like the way he has done it\" \"So what is he exactly?\" The question wasn't supposed to sound so bitter, but he knew the answer already. The fucking dirty son of a bitch traitor had to be working undercover. The man stared at him for a moment before delivering the blow. \"Freddy here is a police informant… an undercover cop\"[Chapter 9] I feel like I have gone Reservoir Dogs crazy! This chapter ends in a (kind-of) cliff-hanger, and I am so sorry to those of you who will be wanting an update when you finish this part of the story, because I wont have computer access until Friday night! Its going to be hell, but there is strictly no laptops on school camp so I have to leave my fanfiction behind for a couple of days (ughh the torture!). So I apologize in advance, but I hope you still enjoy! And I love the reviews I have been receiving! thankyou so much geko-blackjack and virendraLione, You two are super awesome! The car ride had been a silent one, there was no discussion that he could think of that seemed appropriate, and the faulty radio was trying his patience. He banged on the tuner again before throwing himself back into his seat. He let out a large, frustrated huff as he crossed his arms and stared at the road ahead. Mr. White, who insisted on driving was beginning to make groans, whether they were moans of frustration or a growing pain, he couldn't tell. \"Hey, pull over. Let me drive for a bit, I'm bored out of my fucking mind\" Larry appeared to ignore his request, that was until the car moved towards the side of the road and stopped suddenly. The way in which he now sat in the seat made him seem annoyed about something and the jolting halt that the vehicle had come to felt violent in a sense. \"I'm done with calling you Mr. Pink\" The tone was full of ferocity, and the topic that had been brought to light was so unimportant. \"Look man does it really matter? I mean, it's been a rough day and I know you're fed up with the whole situation. I didn't want to leave him behind either ok, but do you really need to know my name?\" Right from the start he had sworn not to reveal his real name, and even though the job was over, he still felt incredibly anxious about exposing it. \"Yes, it may not be important to you but I would like to know. I feel ridiculous calling you Mr. Pink, we've passed that point now and the job is behind us. You said at Paul's that we were friends…friends know each other's names\"- He shook his hands in front of him now, just as he had towards Blonde at the rendezvous point. Why so fucking angry? \"I'll tell you my name, but you have to let me drive\" The front doors of the car flung open at once, both men stepping out of the vehicle to trade positions. As he swung into the driver's seat the familiar feeling of the steering wheel was a welcomed one. Finally, I won't be so damn bored… \"There, you happy. Now Mr. Pink, your name as promised\" He hesitated for a moment. \"Why do we have to-\" \"Mr. Pink!\" \"Fine...fine! My name is Robert\" \"Robert what?\" \"Robert fucking Saulino, you happy?\" Mr. White nodded his head in approval and the car fell silent again as he pulled away from their parked position. \"Is that Italian?\" \"No, it's fucking Chinese\" Larry chuckled lightly before pulling a cigarette from his jacket, and lighting it, exhaling loudly as though he was relieving himself of a great weight. \"You want one, Mr…Saulino?\" \"Nah, I quit\" Both men laughed as Mr. White lit a second smoke, and held it in front of his mouth. He grasped it with his teeth and inhaled, the sensation burning the back of this throat. There was a sudden feeling of companionship as the two of them enjoyed a cigarette each, and although there were tense moments and anger filled arguments often erupted between them, he could trust this man. There was a sudden change in mood, as Larry turned away to look out of the window. \"How do you think Paul and Orange are holding up?\" He exhaled slowly, thinking over the response to that question. \"Larry, I honestly think that they are both going to be ok\" You have to tell Larry and Pink…you have to warn them somehow. He paced up and down the hall as Holdaway finished his conversation with the doctor; the two men swapping information with one another about both the case and 'Freddy's' condition. \"Thankyou doctor, I'll be in tomorrow to check up on how he is but you'll ring me if anything changes?\" The doctor simply nodded before walking in the opposite direction, disappearing from view around the corner. The detective lingered for a moment in front of the window and stared into the room before sighing and making his way to where Paul was standing. \"Ok, so, you're going to have to come back to the ranks with me, I need to ask you a couple of questions, it won't take very long\" \"Sure thing officer\" He stopped walking and stared with one eyebrow raised. \"Do not, ever, call me 'Officer'. I hate being called Officer…just Holdaway, ok?\" He nodded uncomfortably in reply, which caused the man to step forward and wrap a hand around his shoulder. \"Don't feel intimidated, you have to be my favourite person right now. I'm just glad that you had the guts to bring him in, he would have died\" Holdaway's own words seemed to shock him as something he thought was impossible, his expression changing dramatically. \"Anyway, you must be hungry, we will have to go and get something to eat before we return to the station\" \"Holdaway, Sir, would you mind if I just made a phone-call? I just need to call my girlfriend she might be getting worried about where I am, and I don't want to stress her\" The detective handed him the change from his pocket. \"There's a phone just outside, I'll come out and get you in a few moments, I just need to talk to the woman at the desk first\" \"I'll make it quick\" \"Come on Larry hurry the fuck up, you're going to miss the call!\" This had to be Paul, he was the only person with the number to 'Robert's' mobile phone. It rang from somewhere in the backseat and although he tried his hardest to turn around, his wound wouldn't allow it. \"I can't reach!\" Pink drove the car off the road and brought it to a screeching halt, leaping from his seat and opening the rear door. He dived inside, fumbling amongst the various bags and coats before successfully pulling the device from the pocket of a worn pair of pants. Extending the antenna he stood up straight and moved back to his place in the driver's seat. Larry was sure he had a nervous look on his face, Paul wouldn't be calling unless something had gone wrong. Pink continued the conversation, and the anxiousness he felt was only fuelled the longer he was kept waiting for answers. \"Did you get to the hospital, is Orange ok?-\" He needed to know, to hear for himself what was being said on the other end of the call. Suddenly Pinks face became detached, like the world had stopped…something was very, very wrong. I am so cruel! I'm sorry![Chapter 10] This Chapter is so shoddy! I can't even express how much my brain hurts after trying to write this up so quickly. I hope it satisfies enough, and makes sense! Please be honest, if its really bad I will re-write and replace it when I return to my computer on Friday. Enjoy if you are able! The table was cold on his forearms as he nervously locked his fingers together; waiting for Holdaway was torture for his mind. Maybe he is taking forever because they suspect something? He could feel his legs shaking, and it took all of the will-power he had to prevent himself from running his hands through his hair. You were always a bad liar… He needed to be calm, to look as ordinary as possible in front of the police. It was hard though, when the wall that he was seated beside was a mirror. He watched a lot of T.V, and in all of the crime shows, there were always police behind, hidden, out of the view of the criminal. He scanned his own reflection, panicking as a drop of sweat ran down his forehead, shit, they know I'm not completely innocent… \"He definitely looks suspicious…no guiltless person ever looks that nervous.\" Walsh was right, the kid was shaking, sweating and talking to himself. \"He looked fine and hour ago\" \"Do you want me to question him? Isn't there some paperwork you need to have done for Freddy?\" He wanted to interview this 'Paul' character himself, but Officer Tegan was right, the paperwork regarding their injured friend was extensive. \"You know, that would be great, you're a helpful woman Officer, I appreciate it\" \"Anything for you Holdaway\" She smiled over her shoulder as she went to exit the room, a small notepad in hand. She was a kind woman, a bit rough in that sense that she could take care of herself, but overall a perfect cop. Not just that, her short blonde hair and perfect body attracted the men she worked with. \"Hey Tegan, before you go…\" She turned her head and waited for what he had to say, half standing in the doorway \"I think it would be good for Freddy if you went and saw him tomorrow, you know how much he likes you\" She grinned a little before lifting her middle finger, the notepad still gripped awkwardly in her hand. \"That's none of your business...\" Pink reached backwards and placed the phone on the rear seat, atop the mess he had created whilst trying to find it earlier. He could feel something was wrong, the talkative man was too silent…too neutral. \"Hey, what's going on, what happened? What's wrong, did something go wrong?\" He stared out the window silently ignoring Larry's question. What's happened…? He placed a hand on Roberts shoulder reassuringly, but it was brushed away, the thin man standing and walking away from the car. \"Pink answer me! What the fuck happened!\" He continued to take large strides, head down, his body held firmly with his arms by his sides. They were stiffened his hands in fists. \"You don't need to know Larry, ok, its fine, Orange is fine he got to a hospital!\" \"So why are you so angry? Isn't that what we set out to do!?\" He began to whimper as he paced back and forward. \"We're so done…\" He had never seen this side of Pink, he looked as though he could break down at any moment. He opened his door and with much effort pulled himself out of the car, taking a moment to find his footing on the uneven ground. Approaching the man he gripping his sleeve, only this time the soothing gesture was not rejected. Robert leant on him, and silently calmed himself. He knew he couldn't push him, Saulino's temper was sharp, he could snap easily, but waiting for the answers he wanted was almost impossible. Finally when the situation had died down, Pink sat amongst the red dirt and thorny weeds as though he had given up. \"Don't be ridiculous stand up and come back to the car\" \"Why?\" \"What's gotten into you, why are you so upset?\" \"I'm afraid of what you will do if I tell you\" He could feel himself trembling as Larry stood over him . I knew I should have kept driving that day… why, why are you a cop Orange? What he had said was not a lie, he was scared that White would lash out at the news and accuse him of lying, or worse, try to turn back. He inhaled, his body shaking under the stress of knowing that the man they had helped would be most likely hunting them down and finding them as soon as he left his hospital bed. \"Larry please, don't hurt me ok, because what I'm about to say is true\" The older man kneeled down and shook his shoulder firmly. \"Hey, why would you be lying to me now anyways? I trust you Pink, ok, I trust you. But I am going to get very mad if you don't tell me what's going on and soon\" He could feel the anger rising inside him, how could he? How could he sit back and let Larry kill Joe and Eddie? \"Oran-\"he choked up, knowing that White was going to crumble under the weight of the news \"Orange was the rat\". He sobbed for a moment before composing himself and raising his sight to meet his friends, whose grip had tightened on his arm now, fingers digging into his flesh. The throbbing pain in his arm caused by the anger Larry was feeling became numbing, and he felt the need to elaborate on his story, so that he might choose to let his hold go. \"I swear I'm telling the truth, I swear. His name is Freddy Newendyke, he works for the LAPD as an undercover cop, he was there to bring down Joe. He used your fucking trust and faith in him as a shield, and he let you take out his target for him…I'm so sorry Larry\" He could feel his chest tightening with the grief he felt. He had known Joe since he was a kid, and he was nothing but good to him. It hadn't registered that he was really dead until now. \"I killed them…\" White's whole body fell forward into him under the burden of his own words, the now crying man's head pressed firmly against his shoulder. He wouldn't have ever expected this man to break, but he did; and all he could do was pull him closer and do his best to comfort. There was no need for speaking, but he was certain of one thing. The traitor would pay for this.[Chapter 11] I haven't updated in so long, and I am so, so sorry! I will be uploading another chapter tomorrow and most likely another the next day, I apologise again, and I can promise that the story will get interesting in the next instalment! \"Ok, so Paul, can you please repeat that last line again? I just want to get it on tape.\" The female officer had been sweating him down for the past two hours. She was nice enough, but a cunning charm was hidden under her short, blonde, wavy hair. A machine was placed on the table, her thin fingers pressing down softly on the record button. He could feel his throat tighten, what he was about to say was un-erasable. \"I had no part in the robbery, I was given this man to take care of, by two men that I had never seen until four days ago when they knocked on my door.\" \"So what you're saying is two mysterious men show up at your house and toss you a dying man, and you don't call any authorities. The robbery was all over the news, the radio's, weren't you even the slightest bit suspicious that something wasn't right?\" He needed to tread carefully, she missed no detail. \"My father was in the business before he died three months ago. Since then, strange men have come around to the house asking for him. Seeking his advice, asking if they can spend a couple of days to lay low-\" \"Did you get their names- these strange men?\" \"No- there was only one thing that they all had in common, they wore black suits. The two men that brought Freddy to my house were the same, only, they were more desperate. I could tell that they really needed the help; and for some strange reason, I just agreed to it.\" \"Ok, but why take on that responsibility? You don't know these men, why help? It's just the only thing that I don't quite understand\" \"I don't like seeing people suffer, I couldn't turn them away. Orange would have died, they wouldn't have taken him to a hospital\" She sat for a minute across from him and chewed on the end of her pen. \"Fair enough, you sound like a good man, Paul\" There was a small sense of relief when the Officer said this, a smile on her face. She signalled for him to stand and he followed her outside down the corridor of watchful police eyes. \"I'm going to take you back to your car, it was cleaned for you after it was checked for evidence, but they found nothing incriminating. You're a free man\" He sighed heavily as he continued to follow her, red shoes clicking on the tile floor as she walked. She handed her notebook to a large man in thick rimmed reading glasses as she passed his desk, and he greedily accepted the information, scouring the page for something interesting. The office was stuffy, the relief of knowing that fresh air was only a matter of steps away made him want to move towards the door faster. A line of interesting people sat along the side of the hall, cuffed to chairs… Poor Bastards . \"Look, Larry, I think I know how you feel but we should just keep going the way we were going before the call man. I mean, even if we make it all the way back without being arrested, the chances of him being alone, and not under surveillance is small…\" White remained quiet as he drove the car, staring ahead at the road, paying no attention to the plea. He had been trying to talk him into continuing their escape for hours, but when he finally waited for his companions reply, there was nothing, but his own thoughts and the maddening humming that the car was making. This is fucking ridiculous… \"What do you expect to do when we get there, huh? Pull your guns, shoot him down and then escape? This isn't a fucking western, ok, we will be caught this time!\" Fuck you! Motherfucker son of a bitch, going to get us both fucking killed or worse, thrown in- \"I can't do fucking jail man! Ok I'm not like you, I get locked up, I will be seen as fresh meat, I'm not intimidating!\" \"Pink shut up!\" \"Or what, you going to shoot me too! Huh? Like you did with Joe and Eddie! Go ahead I'll be better off dead than in prison!\" The car screeched to a halt. Shit…you took it too far man. Larry's face was twisted into a scowl, and he could see his knuckles turning white as he clenched the steering wheel. \"Shit, ok that was too far, but seriously, how do you expect us to get away with this. Do you really want to hurt him…? I don't…\" He was looking White straight in the eye now, and for a moment he could see remorse, before his lack of conscious fell into play again. \"I don't want to hurt him Pink…I want him dead\" Larry's tone was shaky, as if uncertain of his own judgement, before he put the car back in gear and stared for a moment from his rear vision mirror. The tension had died down, and the car was silent for a few moments, enabling him to create a distraction from their current argument. \"Hey, I'm hungry, can we stop at that place we passed earlier for a meal that's decent. The sign out the front said they had prime ribs…and I just want to sit back, eat a plate of food and talk over plans with my friend ok\" White nodded before the car pulled away, travelling back on the road they had been following away from the place of disaster. He felt no need for arguing anymore, Larry was injured, tired and upset with himself. There was no reason to push him further than he already had. Just agree with his plans…he might come to his own senses…and ribs will put him in a better mood. He could feel a light vibration coursing through the entirety of his body, his lungs filling without him. He could see the bright light through his eyelids, piercing his vision, and the groggy state in which he was in was making him feel sick to the stomach. Where am I? \"Hey? Freddy are you awake…?\" Who…? Tegan? A wave of relief came over him, he was safe. He struggled and pushed harder now to open his eyes, fighting the light that blurred his vision. Blinking twice he moved his head to the left where the familiar voice had come from. Even before his sight had cleared he could see her, the blonde short hair and bright red lips were enough to frame her face. She smiled, and it was instant warmth. It was then that the thought struck him. Where's Larry?[Chapter 12] He made his way down the hall, bustling with nurses and doctors. The door was up ahead, Freddy was finally awake, not quite speaking yet, but he had opened his eyes. As soon as he had received the call from Officer Walsh, a load of stress had been lifted from his shoulders. There were no eyes on the inside of the warehouse, and the events that had taken place were unclear; as soon as he had moved his men inside to apprehend the suspects, the survivors were gone. He was sure that the blood that had pooled on the floor was Freddy's, he felt certain of it, and until 'Mr. Orange' had been brought back to them, he believed that his undercover friend was dead. The number above the door read '37'. He went to look through the window, but the blinds were shut. Slowly opening the door he put his foot first before leaning in; he was sure he had remembered the correct room number. Or is it 36? He hesitated, not wanting to disturb the wrong patient before a familiar voice drew him further into the room. \"Holdaway?\" He stepped inside now, Tegan's golden locks visible and she turned to face him. She had listened to his advice earlier and come down to see their injured friend, something that he was sure Freddy would be pleased about. \"How is he doing?\" She stroked Newendyke's hand softly, and he opened his eyes. The drugs weren't good to him, his expression seemed sleepy and un- alert compared to his normal upbeat self. \"What happened man…I was so worried about you\" He pulled a chair on the opposite side of the bed as Walsh; Freddy looked him in the eyes before shaking his head and exhaling with much effort, he really can't talk. \"They have him on strong medication Jim, he won't be well for at least another two days is what the nurse that came in here before said…\" As she said this, he pulled her arm closer and rested it on his chest, before closing his eyes and grimacing at the weight he had placed on his own bandaged wound. Her eyes watered before she looked away, composing herself. \"Hey, did you manage to put a trace on Paul Torisi's phone?\" Really he was distracting her and taking her mind off upsetting herself further, but monitoring the man closely was important. He seemed strange, not quite guilty, but his story was a little bit off. \"Yeah we have surveillance watching him, and while I had him in for questioning they checked his house and found nothing more than a bag of pot and a stain in the carpet that turned out to be nothing more than chilli dip\" \"Chilli dip? Really? You did put in cameras though right, I want to watch this man…make sure Dimmick and this 'Mr. Pink' don't return to his house asking for more favours\" Freddy stirred at his criminal comrades names. He didn't want to admit it to himself, but Holdaway knew that Freddy had formed a friendship with this Mr. White. It was an unhealthy bond, but it was his first ever undercover job, and the kid didn't know any better. \"I know should have never sent him in. The heist in itself was too hard for any rookie undercover agent. He is a damn good cop but I don't think that he was prepared for that…you know?\" Tegan nodded her head in agreement. \"I spoke with McKlusky after she printed that sheet on Dimmick, before she met with you guys for lunch to go over what she found in the background check, and I have to say I was worried about him but I never thought that the job would end up with him like this.\" She ran a hand through Freddy's hair and his eyelids twitched. The background check made even Holdaway nervous, as they went over the details of the apartment shoot up, that White was suspected to have been the perpetrator behind. The two 9mm pistols drawn and aimed at an apartment full of police and their family members, when he had found out that the man he was working with was a police informant. Recounting the gruesome description of the events in his head was enough to make him cringe, but for some reason he never thought that Freddy would have a fate like that… \"I don't think anyone expected it to go that bad\" He tapped Freddy lightly on the shoulder, taking in the wounds he had received and the dark sunken state of his face. He was needed at the crime scene, to do one last evidence search before the entire thing was cleaned from top to bottom. \"I have to go, the warehouse is being cleaned later today and they want me to give clearance beforehand. You tell those nurses to look after him ok, the mans a fucking hero\" He could hear his own voice beginning to crack, he didn't want to leave just yet, he wanted to stay and wait for him to wake again. Walsh stood and wrapped her arms around him as he headed for the door. \"You'll be ok though hey, you know none of it was your fault. Freddy believed that he could do it, and we all believed it too. Something went wrong along the way…but there's no chance that he will ever blame you for that, and nobody else will either\" She released her hold and stared at him caringly, before retaking her seat. \"Thankyou Walsh, I know that things will be better tomorrow.\" He stared at his plate, mixing the left over gravy and peas with one another. He could hear Mr. Pink finishing the vegetables that came served with the ribs, that weren't as good as they looked on the sign out the front. He wasn't sure how he felt. There was rage, yes; but there was also a part of him that agreed with Robert. He didn't really want to hurt Orange, or 'Freddy' as he had recently learned was his real name, but it was the just thing to do. Joe and Eddie were like family, and now he didn't know why he held such a conviction that they were both wrong for believing that this kid was the traitor. He had after all, only known him for a few weeks leading up to the heist, but there was something about him that was genuine, youthful even. Maybe it was his lack of knowledge, or his attitude that was young at heart, but he was certain now that all of the charm the young man held was trickery. \"More coffee sir?\" The waitress held out the jug in front of him but he respectfully declined. Mr. Pink of course accepted the offer; and he had come to realise that the amount of caffeine the man consumed was in excess and unhealthy. Maybe that's why he's so damn jumpy all the time… As she turned to serve the next table Pinks eyes dropped to stare at her figure, before he fixed his posture and came into contact with Larry's stare. \"What…? You never checked out a woman before, she was pretty fine Larry, I mean did you see-\" The woman at the table across from them was wearing a tight frown on her face, clearly not impressed by the discussion that they were about to start. Robert stared for a moment awkwardly before leaning in closer to continue, whispering the end of his sentence. \"-did you see her ass, she had a backside that looked like something you would only find in one of those picture magazines. That ass, could have been the fucking centrefold\" The conversation took his mind off of the current thoughts that plagued him. \"Don't tell me you're actually thinking of tipping, I thought you never tipped?\" \"Larry, Larry, she has filled my coffee seven times, seven… that's rare, she is like my dream waitress, I haven't had a view like that in a long time my friend. I wasn't even sure if what I was seeing was real.\" In saying this he pulled a pile of one dollar bills from his pocket and laid them flat on the table. \"Come on White, throw in some in some cash…\" \"Sorry Robert, I don't believe in it\" The two chuckled before he searched his pockets and located his wallet, laying out four dollars on top of the money that his companion had already placed. The breakfast meal that the two of them had shared with the rest of the gang before the heist had gone horribly wrong sat on his mind, as they joked about earlier remarks that Pink had made. \"Well Larry, if you're done I'm going to go and find the commode, do you want me to meet you back here, or in the car?\" \"I'll meet you in the car, and find the waitress, give her the tips to make sure she's the one who actually gets the money we just coughed up\" \"Whoa, whoa there man…its fine, I'll find the waitress\" He took the cash from the table and strolled away towards where the young lady with the 'fine ass' was serving a table and struck up a conversation the seemed to make her uncomfortable. He smiled, for the first time in days. I was trusting the wrong people in the job the whole time… He walked away from the waitress and turned giving her a wink. She smiled awkwardly before hurrying away with her coffee pot, making sure she put as much distance as she could between them, as he made his way to the men's room. It was cold, colder in the bathroom than it was in the diner outside. He sat down on the seat and goose bumps appeared on his thighs as they came into contact with the plastic. It was empty, and quiet, the noise of glass plates and light chatter could be heard, but overall it was peaceful. He stared at the door, before searching for the end of the toilet roll, noticing a newspaper placed folded on top of the holder. He opened it and sat up straight and located the date. Today's paper, let's see what happening in the real world… The front page had a headline about a government scandal, something that would have normally interested him, if the second set of bold text on the lower part of the page hadn't caught his attention first. \"Police informant hospitalized after working undercover, see page 4\" He wanted to close the paper and forget about the whole thing, he didn't want to read the 'hero' story that he knew would be on the following pages. Just fold it up and put it back where you found it… He held it in his hands, curiosity was getting the better of him, and he knew that he should leave it in its place, but he couldn't. He turned to page four, the title reading \"Reservoir Dogs\". \" Following the diamond store heist at Karina's , we have received further news that a Police informant was working alongside the men that planned and executed the robbery, in an attempt to bring down and immobilize an organised crime ring. After the robbery went horribly wrong, Frederick Newendyke, a 28 year old officer, went missing and was believed dead by authorities before he showed up, four days after the incident in a grave state. Doctors are hoping that he will wake and recover, but are uncertain of his survival at this point…\" He scanned over the following three columns until he found a contribution to the article that interested him. \" One of the leading officers on the case stated earlier in the week that the rendezvous point where the criminals were supposed to meet after the heist, had turned into a bloodbath, leaving three of the men involved, and one officer, dead. He explained the turns of events as it being \"similar to when you see rats fall into a barricaded water reservoir, they don't last very long under the pressure, turning on one another, and eating those that fell into the same situation, in hopes of survival and escape. These felons did exactly that, they turned on one another. But I just want to make it clear that we will find the dogs that escaped, and they will not get away this time\". The statement made has earned these criminals the title of the 'Reservoir Dogs''; anyone who has seen either of these two men, or has any information on their whereabouts can contact the number below.\" The Reservoir Dogs… I like it. He stared at the black and white photograph of Larry that sat alongside a detailed police sketch of himself. He finished up in his cubical before washing his hands at the sink and tucking the paper under his arms. He stepped into the evening air outside, making his way towards the car in which he could see Larry seated in the passenger seat. Opening the door on his side he tossed the paper to his right, catching the older man off guard. \"Hey White, page four…\"[Chapter 13] \" Freddy Newendyke, a 28 year old undercover officer was brought into the hands of medical professionals 2 days ago, by a Good Samaritan, and appears to be on his way to recovery.\" In his mind he had been hoping that Orange would not wake up. The interview at the police station had him anxious about how truly safe his secrets were, but with Freddy awake, and most likely talking soon the sense of dread was growing. It was all over the news, and in the papers… \"The Reservoir Dogs\", and after Pinks reaction on the phone, the last thing he needed was two criminals showing up on his doorstep. What if the police are watching you, pack up and go someplace until it all dies down…no. If you leave and something does happen that will look even more suspicious… The sketch of Pink and the photograph of White flashed onto the screen, as the woman reporting, continued to speak of how dangerous they both were. It was bullshit, they had saved Orange, with the known possibility that the authorities might easily track them down, and yet they still put their freedom on the line to make sure he survived. It wasn't right… There was a sudden rap on the door that caused him to jump, losing his plate of packet-made carbonara. Fuck… He stood slowly, looking for shadows that might indicate who was outside, eyes jumping to the clock that boomed, making the situation all the more eerie when he read the time. 11 at night? Who? He took slow and silent steps towards the front room of the house. One after the other, the thumps continued, angrily, violently on his front door… This is not the police…this is not Pink, or White…There was only one other person. The door came down on the wooden floor causing the house to shake, as four men pushed through the small entrance with guns drawn. He felt his instinct kick in, as he ran for the knife he knew was left out on the kitchen bench. A shot was fired, smashing the glass in a nearby cabinet, and he fell to his knees, a shard imbedding itself in his cheek. The footsteps of a gunman grew louder as he searched with one arm, knocking the weapon from its place. He felt as though he could throw up right then and there, memories of what these men were capable of, things had done to him in the past re-surfacing. Fear gripped his mind, as his fingers wrapped around the smooth wooden handle . You can't let them take you this time… A boot came down on his left hand, pain shooting through his arm. He tried to free his broken fingers, but found himself unsuccessful, as he laid amongst the shattered fragments of his deceased mother's plate collection. He turned to face the man, as the heel of the boot was pushed further into the wood, the twisting motion breaking bones that weren't already. \"You should have stayed away, boy, boss told you not to get involved in anything\" A pained gasp escaped his lips. \"Sto- Stop! You're making, a big fucking mistake!\" The weight was lifted from his hand as he rolled onto his back, pulling the arm close to his chest and sitting up. He needed to get out of this situation, and the only way that he could think to escape was hasty. He could injure the man that broke his hand, but three others would follow…. it's worth a shot. Inhaling deeply he gripped the knife that he had now pulled in close to his back, out of sight. As he looked up to the man that was now towering over him, one eyebrow raised waiting for an excuse, he swung the knife with precision embedding it in the brute's leg until the blade was no longer visible; ignoring the 40 calibre, semi auto pistol aimed at his forehead. As he had anticipated the man dropped, similar to that of a sack of potatoes. He scrambled to find his footing, slipping sideways on the tiles, as the other henchman shot bullet after bullet in his direction. The back fence was his best bet... make a run for the main road … don't stop, don't turn around, they're going to follow, to chase and hunt you down, but you are faster…keep running. Height was his advantage as he approached the barrier placed in front of him, and even with only one hand, he found it incredibly easy to pull himself over. \" Go and get the car! You, hey! Follow him goddamn it!\" The distant shouting kept him moving, the last time he was in their hands was only a few months earlier, and still, what he had witnessed them do to his father, and the scars he bore from the event kept him from finding peace and easy rest. He cleared the last fence, reaching the highway, believing in his own mind that he had made a successful getaway. Paul walked in the shadows along the narrow footpath, jumping at every small sound that was heard in the shrubbery, they're gone…but keep moving. The crossing ahead was ill-lit, the light flashing on and off before leaving the road in complete darkness. He walked forward staring down a dark side street, a sinister feeling taking over him, hair standing. A set of headlights flashed on and the rumble of a car engine sounded, thundering, he felt frozen, stuck in his place by fear. He ran out across the main road, paying no attention to the cars passing by, horns blaring. One of the vehicles screeched to a halt, coming into contact with his legs causing his body to roll into the windscreen, glass shattering under his force and weight. Paul looked up staring across the road to where the Boss' men were getting out of their car, loaded guns in hand. He wanted to get up and run, but he couldn't, a deep gash ran from his knee to the top of his thigh, there was no escape this time. He dragged himself across the bonnet of the car, falling with no grace on to the stony ground below. Give up…you can't run anymore \"Oh shit! What the fuck did we hit, was that a person…fuck! Goddamn it White!\" Pink? The door of the car flew open, Whites face shocked by the coincidence. \"Paul? What the fuck are you doing out here? You're supposed to be laying low!\" \"Get me in the car! Help, we have to go, we have to leave!\" White seemed to understand the urgency in his voice, stirring with haste. As the older man moved to where he was seated, a spray of bullets hit the hood of the car, embedding in the already damaged panelling with a startling pattering sound. Larry got onto his knees, wrapping an arm around his shoulder, he could feel his body trembling, the open wound on his leg bleeding profusely now. Pink retaliated, angered by the attack, pulling his two pistols and firing in the direction of the other car. One of the men that had moments before been pursuing him dropped lifeless to the ground, another, still seated in the car, crying out in pain. \"Get in the fucking car!\" The words were harsh, as the thin man reloaded. White shoved Paul into the backseat, before realising that he was injured. The experienced thief turned his attention to the injury, seemingly forgetting the real threat. \"Larry I'm fine! Just get us out of here!\"[Chapter 14] Her touch was soft as she ran her fingers through his hair. It was soothing, a calming gesture that made him feel as though he could stay in this room forever and never leave. Like he could escape all of the grief and misery that he had put Larry and Pink through. You should have told him that you were a cop. Why didn't he speak up? He was scared, he was dying, but most of all he didn't want to disappoint White…now they both knew. They knew that he was the rat, the traitor; a part of him wished he wasn't, that he wasn't going to return to his empty apartment, and an office full of colleagues branding him as a hero… \"What are you thinking about?\" Freddy opened his eyes to her, the only person who had sided with him since he had stirred from his sleep two days earlier. \"Nothing…\" His voice was husky, the medication he had been given made it hard to speak at times. A troubled smile came over her face, as she stood from her chair to move closer to him. \"You can tell me, it can be just between the two of us\" He wanted to tell Tegan, he really did, but how could he share what he was thinking with her, there was no way she would understand. He shook his head slowly from side to side, causing her to sigh deeply…fearfully. She rested her head on his chest, and he pulled her closer, wrapping an arm around her shoulder. He could feel her heartbeat through the thin hospital sheets. \"Go to sleep then\", she said kissing his forehead \"You look tired\" As she rose there was a knock at the door, Holdaway was standing outside beckoning her into the hallway, probably to share more of the secrets their not telling me. Tegan squeezed his hand, before taking her things from where she had hung them on the back of her chair. \"I'll come back tomorrow, ok, relax a little\" Freddy felt himself nod in response, as her heels ticked along the floor, before she disappeared; the door closing on its own, slowly. There was no way for him to tell what was going on with White and Pink, but he figured that if they had been caught he would have been told. That means their still out there… A mix of emotions flooded him, if they were still free, then that meant he wasn't responsible for their imprisonment; but if they knew that he was the rat, Larry would be back to finish him off. Why would he do such a thing after so much effort went into 'Mr. Orange's' defence? Because it was the even-handed thing to do. \"Walk with me\" He gripped her arm, there was no way to explain what had occurred at the 'Paul' kid's house. Overturned furniture, kicked in door, blood. It was a mess, and the boy was nowhere to be found. \"Holdaway what's going on?\" She asked as she tried to pace her strides with him, skipping every few steps in attempt to keep up. \"Paul's house, we go in there this morning when we ring and he doesn't answer his phone right, house is a fucking mess. Smashed windows, glass everywhere…dried blood on the floor, we haven't gone over the tapes yet but I want you to look over the damage done inside and tell me what you see\" \"He's gone I'm guessing? Do you think it was an escape from the law, or was someone after him?\" \"I haven't told you the full story yet, wait, it gets better. Last night on a road a few blocks over from his house, gunfire was reported. We get there ten minutes after the whole ordeal went down. Two men dead, shattered car windscreens…it was messy.\" \"Whoa, whoa, wait… you think its Dimmick and Pink?\" \"Agh wait! Yes, because, a young man identified by witnesses to be around the age of twenty was pulled into one of the cars that escaped the scene, I have no doubts about it being Paul\" He watched her expressions change, brows furrowed. It was frustrating, he knew that much, to not know what was truly going on. \"I let that little bastard free, he probably knew exactly where they were…lying little prick, can't wait until I find him, he's going to get an earful from me\" Holdaway tried his hardest to hold in his smile, admiring the feisty anger that Officer Walsh was known for. She began to make her way down the hall ahead of him, stride more firm, every heel click sounding more determined than the last. \"Show me this crime scene, I want to get a real good look at it\" \"This place is a dump, look at it! This is our hideout, really, couldn't we have stayed at a motel or something?\" The abandoned set of units was, admittedly, not very appealing from the outside. It was however, home to a small apartment in which Larry had furnished while he was staying in town for the heist, nothings better than no rent, and no suspicious neighbours. \"Pink just get out of the car, we don't have much of a choice, we're wanted for murder, remember, mugshots on T.V all that business, I wouldn't be too fussy if I were you\" The thin man made a look of disgust, before pushing the car door open. His hands were then placed on his hips as he swayed from side to side, making an effort to shows his discontent. \"Such a shithole\" \"Goddamn it shut up! – are you alright Paul?\" Paul looked like he was just as annoyed with Roberts whining, raising his eyebrows and smirking slightly. He was a good kid, very calm, and in tune with what the world of crime was able to throw at him. \"Come on buddy, let's get you inside…take a look at that leg of yours\" He reached down wrapping an arm under the young mans to take his weight before hoisting him out of the car. There were black bags under his eyes from lack of sleep, and the sticks and leaves still in the boys hair, were getting on Larry's nerves, presentation is everything. He let it go for now, wanting to get them all inside before anyone spotted them. \"Hey Pink, get your ass inside\" He turned in response, cigarette in his mouth. \"I'll be in soon, just give me a fucking minute to enjoy the breeze and fresh air before I'm imprisoned in that hell-hole you call home\" He felt himself roll his eyes, before whispering to Paul. \"Drama queen over there needs a moment, come on, let's get you settled and fed so you can get some sleep, yeah?\" He received a nod before making his way towards the building, Getting up those stairs is going to be fun. He pushed his way through the lobby door, pleased that he chose to construct his nest on the third floor instead of the sixth, with Paul hung from his left shoulder. The first step seemed easy, but by the time they had reached the second floor platform they both needed to sit and catch their breath. It wasn't long before the young man was on his feet again however, wanting to get to the room as quick as possible, Larry figured, to sleep or eat. He aided him again, climbing four stairs before the main entrance door creaked open, Pink's mumbling to himself echoed throughout the empty building, causing them both to chuckle as he quickly caught them both. \"You want to just carry him up Larry? It would be easier.\" Is Pink offering to help? I never thought I would see the day… \"If you think you're able\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" \"It means you're only a small man and we have a whole flight of stairs to walk still\" The string bean scoffed before retaliating. \"Old man, if you can do it, I'm sure as hell that I can do it\" \"Hey guys-\" Paul spoke up over the insults that had been let fly \"I'm flattered, ok, I really am, but I think teamwork is needed here…\" Cheeky little bastard , he thought, as Robert came to give him a lift, picking up the boys legs whilst he took the weight of his shoulders. \"Holy shit, Jesus Christ, what do you fucking eat? I swear you weigh more than my Aunt Patty\" \"It's called muscle Pink, ever heard of it, you clearly don't have any\" Mr. Pink's facial expression changed from smug to insulted. \"You keep talking like that you little prick, I might just drop you. I know you're not a man yet but that's no reason to get jealous alright\" Paul sniggered at the remark, as they scaled the last three steps, huffing at the end, shit that was harder than it looked. He left his two companions to sit on the rug outside his door while he fiddled on his keys for the correct one to open the lock. Found it, he pushed it in, the handle clicking as he opened the door leading to his hideaway. He walked inside and checked it hadn't been tampered with before calling the others in. Everything was the way he left it, Whiskey on the bench, couch draped with his blanket. He made his way into the other room, the mattress on the floor also, made up ready for sleeping. Larry went and retrieved Paul, who was standing in the doorway where Pink had left him. \"Come on kid, get inside, make yourself at home, go and rest on the bed in the other room\" Extending a hand, he led the young man into the room where he lowered him down into a comfortable position. \"I'm going to have to clean that leg before you do any sleeping alright? There's no way you're getting away with not cleaning it, we don't want no infection to make itself at home.\" He looked down, and stared at the man's grazed and bruised figure. He's a fucking tough boy. Larry was about to get some alcohol and the hidden medical kit before the state of Pauls hair stopped him. He pulled the comb from his pocket, running it through the tattered raven hair, removing the debris and fragments of windscreen glass. \"You remind me of my dad a lot\" He was looking into his eyes now, a childlike innocence radiating from the young man's youthful face. \"How so?\" \"I don't know you just do\" \"And where is this father of yours?\" The pause in the conversation caused tension. Shit. \"He's dead. Those guys who came after me, they killed him a few months back. I'd love to make them all pay for it, but there's only one me… you probably don't want to hear all of this touchy feely shit anyways White, it's not important\" \"No, no, please…elaborate\"[Chapter 15] Oh God! I really hope this makes sense! Please, I think I will need reviews for this chapter so that I know its not a total fail! (Or is a total fail D:), I hope you enjoy it anyway, it was a major brain strain to write! \"My dad, used to work for a man down in Long Beach, now this guy's selling out all of his associates to the LAPD, he's a real asshole. One day we go and see this 'boss' of his, I was just tagging along, learning tricks of the trade, walk into the guys office and what do we find? He's in a get-together with three boys in blue, talking about a deal that was going down in a weeks' time, some drug swap that he had heard about through his connections. Dad, he was a businessman, he didn't believe in ratting to cops, he informed these high-end drug runners that they were in big trouble, authorities knew about their meet and greet; they were thankful, cancelled the whole thing.\" He took a sip of water, both Pink and White were staring at him now, quiet and content on hearing the full story. It wasn't easy talking about his father, but he was sure that this guy 'Long beach Mike' was behind the police set-up at Karina's. \"And everyone just assumed that they chickened out of the swap, nobody would have even guessed that we informed them. Now Dad, he put the whole thing behind him, forgot about Long Beaches' betrayal of his fellow man and continued working for him like nothing happened. It wasn't until about three or so months ago, that an enormous heist was being planned, a bank robbery; loot at the end would leave all of the thieves rich…you'd know…hey Pink?\" The thin man gave him a sideways glance. \"My father learned that the bank robbery was about to take place; and the cops knew the time and location. We arrived on the day to give these guys warning, they raved that their plan was flawless, and that there was no set-up, only one of the robbers believed us; making a fuss about how our claim might be accurate. That worried, little anxious man, was Pink. I bet now that all of those men wished that they had believed us from the beginning, because officers poured out of buildings that were across the road, next door to the bank, bastards were left right and centre. Dad and I made a dash for the car, Pink was right on our heels; climbing in the back and escaping with us, we took him back to the house until it was safe for him to leave\" \"Whoa wait, how does this all relate to Diamond Heist though, and the guys that came after you, I don't get it?\" Larry sat with a lost expression on his face; Paul understood why it didn't make sense to them both, it was pretty far-fetched. \"My dad's boss Long Beach Mike, he had a partnership, if that's what you want to call it, with Joe. I'm saying this guy set you up, he is the one who would have been responsible for getting Orange on the inside. Cabot, he would have been sold out\" Everyone sat in silence once again, taking in what Paul was saying to them. It was Pink who spoke up now. \"Ok, I understand, but what happened after that, where's your dad? Why did you have a car full of gangsters hunting you down on a busy street in the middle of the night?\" A lump in his throat formed, haven't I told you both enough already? \"He- he um...\" he swallowed hard \"He was killed by 'boss'. The cops showed Long Beach surveillance from the bank robbery, and he identified our car as being at the scene. Once it was figured out that we were warning guys that Mike was trying to set up them up, he killed Dad, and scared me into silence, told me if I ever got involved in anything to do with him and his business again that he would kill me too\" \"I get it now…those guys who were after you were working for this 'Long Beach Mike' asshole. He set up Joe, got Orange in on the operation as an undercover, Mike would have been relying on the cops to catch all of the thieves after the heist, but when we escaped he would have worried that we might find out he grassed our boss. To add to the situation further, we show up at your house, which then put you in danger. The history that you have with the man would have made him believe that you were calling him out as the bad guy, telling us all about him and how he two-times his connections; if that kind of information were to spread, he would be a dead man, other gang leaders would hunt him down. He goes with the threat that he made earlier, sends a few of his guys to your house to kill you\" White had a shocked expression on his face, as though he couldn't quite comprehend the words coming out of his mouth, the whole thing seeming too elaborate. Pink kept his eyes closed for a moment as he sat in the corner. \"So what do we do then? Does this mean that 'Long Beach Mike' is after all of us now?\" \"I'd say so Robert\" The words came out simply, because it was true, they were not only running from the cops, they were running from the man who had destroyed a perfect job, and caused the death of old friends. \"Well it's too late to hand ourselves in now! Fuck! I knew robbing that diamond store was no good from the beginning!\" Pink began to throw thing around, causing Paul to flinch, they were in real trouble, but it wasn't the time to fall apart. They needed to come together now, to band and make some kind of escape, or a plan to fix the hole that they had found themselves in. \"Do you know where this 'Long Beach Mike' is, Paul?\" White asked the question as if he were already formulating some kind of frenzied attack. \"If he hasn't already booked a plane ticket and flown to the other side of the country; yeah, I do know where that bastard is.\"[Chapter 16] I cannot apologise enough to everyone out there following and reading this story (especially VirendraLione whom I promised a chapter to last weekend and didn't update) I have had the worst computer problems all this week but am glad to be writing again! Please forgive me everyone! I hope you enjoy this chapter… He pushed his way through the commotion of worried neighbours and police officers that had gathered on the road outside of Paul's house, keeping Walsh only a step behind. The ground was wet still, from the bout of rain that had hit earlier that morning, and whatever evidence may have been found towards the front of the house was most likely lost; pressed into the soft dirt by heavy work boots and tires of police vans that had been brought up out of the gutters onto the lawn. As they reached the front door of the house he watched Tegan undo the strap of her heels, banging the shoes on the porch railing, before slipping her dainty feet into a set of police boots that were procedure for all officers entering the crime scene. He too was in the process of pulling them onto his feet when the screen door flung open, Walsh stepping inside without him, eager to find something that they had missed earlier. The state of the home inside was nothing that Holdaway hadn't seen before, smashed glass, blood. It was common for a mess like that to be found every now and then; but this felt different, he needed to close this case, for Freddy, so that he could go home and not have to worry that his friend might be in danger. Lawrence Dimmick, he would kill Newendyke as soon as he left the hospital doors, and that was something that he wasn't going to let happen. \"You alright sir?\" The young officer stared at him with worry, and it was only then he realised that he was squatted against the wall of the house with his head in his hands. Jesus Christ I need some sleep . \"At ease Pine\" he said with a chuckled \"I'm fine, just really fucking tired…\" Justin Pine, the newbie nodded nervously before descending the stairs, making his way towards a van slowly, turning every few steps and making awkward eye contact. He was a strange kid, but funny when he wasn't on the job; he remembered running into him around a month ago at a bar, the boy was all talk, something that much of the office at work was not used too. The glass crunched beneath her feet, as she was lead through the main room. The bullet holes in the timber walls made her feel almost sorry for the kid, she really hoped in a way that he was alright. She approached the kitchen, a small notch of the wooden benchtop missing was the first thing that caught her eye, hacked away by what she would have guessed was a knife. \"Did you examine this?\" She looked closer, red smeared fingerprints ran down the side of the dark coloured cabinet, only visible with closer inspection. \"Yes Ms. Walsh, Holdaway noticed that earlier and had us compare the nick in the wood with the household knives. It matched this one, we found it on the lawn in the backyard\" Blood covered the knife that was handed to her in an evidence bag. \"Whose blood, do you know?\" \"We haven't been able to find any match for the blood, but we don't believe it's the boys\" \"Why not\" \"Whoever attacked this house, wouldn't have needed a knife. They had guns, Paul would have made his attack with the knife, and we think that he left the house injured but not severely. There was traces of his blood on a few of the shards of glass but that was it, and judging by the carnage on the main road a few blocks over, he made a pretty damn good escape, I don't think he would have made it that far if he had been shot\" \"How do you know he didn't escape from the attacker's car, maybe he didn't run all that way?\" \"Because neighbours reported him jumping fences and passing through their yards late last night after being woken by gunfire\" Nodding she moved to where she had a view of the back fence from the kitchen window. The fence surrounding the house was tall. \"He must be agile, to get over that fence…\" \"Like I said, his get-away was an impressive one\" She realised that Holdaway hadn't had an input yet, before turning and realising that he was nowhere in sight. She thanked the four officers for letting her come through and view the scene before making her way to the front yard, where her boss was standing, drinking a cup of coffee and speaking with an elderly woman, who was pointing her hand furiously in various directions. \"Margaret this is Tegan Walsh, she interviewed Paul a few days ago\" The old woman shook her head, tears visibly building. \"He is such a lovely young man, you will find him won't you? When my husband died last year, he used to bake the most beautiful raisin cookies and come and have morning tea on my front porch. I can't even bear the thought of someone doing such dreadful things to him, he really is so kind…\" Holdaway sent her a sideways glance, as if unsure about just how much this little old lady knew. \"I never did like his father though…\" \"And why is that Margaret?\" She felt herself saying, immediately interested by the elaboration. \"It's not that he wasn't a kind man, he was. I just didn't quite like the look of the company that he kept. Lance was a doctor, a fine doctor too, but the men that used to visit that house of theirs didn't look at all like they could be trusted. I never saw normal-looking visitors after Pauls mother Rita passed away a few years ago. Every single person that has entered that premises was dressed in a suit and I may be an old woman but I know what a gang looks like, and Lance was involved with one\" She had her face furrowed now into a scowl, one of distaste. \"If they have hurt that boy, my god I hope you make them pay for it\" They both turned to each other now, neither of them had even put the slightest bit of thought into Paul's father. \"Thank you so much Mrs. Pastor\" Holdaway said, jotting something into a notepad \"We will keep you updated, and make sure you know if we find him\" She waved her hand at the two of them and smiled before turning and walking towards the neighbouring house, at an extremely slow pace. \"I think it's time for you to look into Paul's father a little further, don't you think? And I'd appreciate you going over those tapes from the bugged camera's we set in the house, and telling me if the crew inside were right about how it all went down, or if there's anything that was missed\" \"Will do, Holdaway\" He held Paul tightly against his chest. Can't we take a fucking break? The kid gripped his arm firmly -as White tipped the alcohol onto the rag once more - preparing himself for the pain that he knew was going to follow. He felt himself grimace as the cloth was applied to the wound, the body in his lap tensing and kicking out innocently, this kind of pain must have been new to him. \"Hey it's almost over, Larry's almost done, then it's just bandages and you can go to sleep\" He wasn't much of a comforter, he never had been, but he tried to be. He was a good kid, he didn't need his entire life to be blown away by a couple of robbers and their injured friend. That's exactly what they had done, uprooted everything, all of the normalcy that he had achieved since his father had died was gone. Now what were they going to do? Go after a fucking crime boss and try take him down? What was it going to achieve? They would all be better packing up and leaving… at least that was his opinion , I can't do fucking jail. Paul writhed again as the cloth came down on the open wound. It was surprisingly deep, he would have never had thought it was that bad. He tightened his grip as the kid threw his head back into his shoulder, sobbing slightly. \"It's clean Robert, pass me a dressing\" He looked over his shoulder and moved his hand through the contents of the metal aid kit before finding what he was looking for. \"He'll be ok, won't he Larry?\" \"He will be fine after he gets some sleep\" Pink nodded to himself before roughly running his hands over Paul's chest, the kid's jacket and under-shirt soaked through with sweat. \"Did you hear that, you'll be fine tomorrow\"[Chapter 17] I tried to make this chapter longer but it didn't really work... hope you guys enjoy it anyways, and please... reviews are much appreciated! She sat in the still dark room and looked over the footage from Paul's house. She watched the boy stand from his chair before looking directly at the camera that, at the time was concealed inside a large clock. It was in that moment that his face changed, he knew it was no normal visitor, judging by time, and in an instant he was running backwards and falling into shards of glass created by the aggressor's guns. Again Tegan felt herself cringe at the moment of the recording in which the knife was used by Paul and pushed straight through the leg of the man who seemed to be in charge of the raid. He was used to violence, and he knew these men; the elderly neighbour was right. Suddenly the door opened and light poured in from all directions. Her superior stood there holding a paper bag in one arm, re-closing the door with the other. \"I got you a taco, did you find anything interesting?\" \"There's nothing on these tapes apart from the fact that Paul was definitely the one who used the knife, watch this…\" The video replayed once more and even Holdaway cringed. \"Jesus Christ, I guess that means we're not dealing with your average breaking and entering. Nobody would have the guts to put a knife through a strangers leg, especially not if that stranger was holding a gun to their head\" \"So what do we do now sir?\" \"We find this kid, because he knows where Dimmick and Pink are, I'm positive that he does\" They both nodded in silent agreement, as she flicked the screen off and sat back lazily in her chair. \"Where do we start?\" \"We need to start at the hospital…Freddy gets out in two hours\" She felt her heart stop for a minute before she rose and stood to face to face with Holdaway. \"How can he be let out this early, he couldn't even sit up last time I saw him?\" \"Apparently 'special care' has been organised\" \"That's bullshit!\" \"I know its bullshit ok, but be calm. He needs to move around, you know him and how he is, there's no way he was going to stay in a bed for longer than two weeks\" \"You know why he wants to get out though don't you, he wants to help on this case and I don't think it will do him any good\" \"He wants to be put back on but I've already told him I won't risk his health, he understands, Walsh, he just wants to go home\" Blisters were beginning to form on his palm due to the pressure and weight he was placing on the cane, four more steps man, and then you're at the top… \"Do you need a hand Freddy?\" Tegan spoke calmly behind him. \"I'm fine, I just realised I don't have the keys.\" \"I do\" Holdaway called from the level below. He pressed down on the walking stick again, making it to the third floor had used what energy he had, now all he wanted was to sit down. Home was behind the door that stood in front of him, the familiar smell of cigarettes and a fridge full of beer, his couch, and his comics. The door lock clicked as the key was turned. \"Home sweet home Freddy, now get your ass inside\" He smiled as his two companions moved to the side, allowing him to enter first. Home sweet-what the hell… \"I did a little cleaning up before you got out…I know that you don't appreciate the fact that the carpet and floors have been cleaned for the first time in four years, but I couldn't leave it in the state it was in\" Unbelievable… \"Hey, I cleaned the carpets about six months ago, and I liked the fact that my apartment smelt like shit, that's why I wanted to come home to it\" Tegan sighed as Holdaway chuckled lightly in the background - \"I told you not to worry about cleaning it Walsh\" \"I'm guessing you got rid of all my alcohol and stashed smokes too\" He turned to her now, a smile on her face. \"McKlusky and I took care of that, we had a movie night\" Freddy shook his head, before moving towards the couch and seating himself on the soft, worn leather. \"Oh well, I'm just going to have to make it filthy again, that can be my personal goal for the next three days\" \"Hey, wake up, you feeling alright?\" He shook Pauls shoulder slightly, the young boy's eyelashes fluttering open into a blank stare at the roof. Robert had woken only minutes earlier, discovering that the car and Larry were both gone, and although he knew that White would never up and leave them behind, there was a nagging question of where he had gone playing over in the back of his mind. \"You still feeling light headed?\" Paul rushed to sit up, seemingly confused and tired, swaying left heavily. He grabbed the kids sleeve and steadied him, before lying him back down on the bed. \"Whoa there slow it down, you don't need to get up, I just wanted to know if White told you where he was going, the cars gone.\" The answer he received was raised eyebrows, followed by a deep sigh. \"He – He said that he was going to pick up some fresh shit from the store\" Thank god…normally when he doesn't tell me what he's doing, it's because he knows I won't agree with whatever whacked out plan he's created. \"Thanks kid now go back to sleep, I'll wake you up for breakfast when Larry gets back\" He tapped Paul on the shoulder as he rolled to the side, cocooning himself in a thick blanket. Standing to leave the room Robert reached for his watch that he had left on the table beside the bed, he had taken it off when helping Larry to suture and wrap the young mans wounded leg the night before. As he clipped the watch it caught his skin, pinching a small cut on the surface of his wrist that drew blood. God damn this fucking watch, always fucking does this… As he went to pull the silver clasp away the door in the room over flung open. He pushed himself against the closest wall, holding his breath, the hairs standing on the back of his neck. Paul stirred also, alarmed by the sudden loud thud. He lifted a finger to his mouth quickly, signalling for the kid to be quiet as loud footsteps echoed in the kitchen. 'Pink, where's your gun?' The young boy mouthed in panic, and it was only then that he realised it was on the table in the other room. Fuck! 'I don't have it!' \"And he huffed and puffed…\" The unfamiliar voice rang in his ears, a million thoughts racing through his head in time with his heartbeat, this was not police and this was not Larry. He held his eyes shut firmly, pressing the back of his head against the brick wall in shock. \"And he blew their fucking door in…\" He felt himself shout Paul's name, before a force collided with the back of his skull knocking him to the ground. He couldn't escape the grip of the man above him, clawing at the assailants eyes with all of the force that he could muster. He was on the verge of blacking out, the hard grasp on his throat preventing him from drawing any breath; anger made him want to continue thrashing in an attempt to harm the man who would undoubtedly be leading him to his death, but they were both outnumbered three to one. Pink was down, sprawled across the floor in the corner of the room having his hands tied behind his back, and it was now that Paul knew he needed to give it up, black spots dotted his vision as the side lamp was brought down, making rigid contact with his face. \"Tie his fucking hands up, don't let the little bastard escape again\" A voice from the other side of the room directed two men towards the door - the both of them pulling a lifeless Pink from the ground and dragging him into the kitchen. He could feel the blood trickling down the side of his face as thick ropes were bound around his ankles and wrists; he couldn't move, not even if he wanted to. \"Pick him up and get him out to the car\" The toe of a boot came into contact with his side, causing him to curl inwards, before he was lifted over a large man's shoulder. Hair hung in his eyes and stuck to the sweat on his brow, his head swaying side to side uncontrollably with the pace of his haulers steps. The floor was underneath him, kitchen tiles, Pinks unmistakeable custom made shoes. \"Hey boss who's this guy\" A young attacker looked towards an older taller man for answers now, waving his gun in the direction of Robert who was face down on the floor, breathing heavily. \"I don't know, but we don't need him\" As he was carried down the stairs a single shot rang throughout the building, his heart stopped… Pink.[Chapter 18] I am warning prior to your reading of this chapter that it may get extremely sad towards the end...I am sorry! \"YOU BASTARDS! NO!\" The room above him fell silent as the man that carried him descended the stairs. Pink…this isn't happening, I'm still dreaming, I'm asleep still. He closed his eyes tightly wanting the nightmare to end, there was no possible way that Pink was dead, because he was just there, moments ago stirring him from sleep and asking about Larry. He opened his eyes again, but he hadn't woken…he was still bound at the wrists and ankles being hauled away for torture, information…whatever these men wanted to use him for. Footsteps sounded heavily on the stairs behind him. He lifted his head to meet the gaze of the man following, small drops of blood visible on his cuffs as he readjusted them, before tucking his gun away. \"I swear to god if you did anything to him I'll fucking kill you! I'll kill you all!\" A discordant laughter resonated throughout the group of men, filling the lobby with the sickening sound. They weren't scared, they weren't even the slightest bit concerned by the threats he was making, why would they be? He was young, vulnerable and weak. He sobbed at the thought of Pink, hoping that he was ok, but knowing that he wasn't. I can't lose Robert too... The thick liquid rose from his lungs, preventing him from inhaling through his nose, as he gasped for air. He couldn't move, he couldn't see, but he could feel the blood pooling around his torso. Every movement made him want to scream in pain, every contraction or tensing of muscles making him want to kick out. But there was no noise, he had no breath to give, and no life to give to movement. A slow but growing weight pressed on his wound now, causing him to involuntarily throw his head into the tile floor. The man above him laughed sickly before a second loud thundering sound shook the floor and caused his entire body to twist in a contorted manner. \"Two is enough, come on move it, we need to get Mr. Torisi back to boss\" \"Come on Greg, one more time\" A heavy boot pressed hard on his shoulder. \"Stop...stop...\" He spoke up now to the man holding the weapon above him, ignoring the shattering pain, determined to give last words to those who were moments away from taking his life. \"The b-boy you just took...tell him I'm alright, and that he's - he's a good kid\" The click of the revolver rang loudly in his ears along with the sound of a poisonous snigger, as he held his breath in fright and agony, this is it. He was lowered from shoulder height and held by the bindings at his hands, as a small man fiddled with various keys on a keychain, looking for the one that fit the trunk. A third shot sounded over the buildings area, and he closed his eyes tightly, his breathing erratic. \"You're all going to pay for this! You fucking bastards! Fuck you all, fuck y-\" The gag was stuffed between his teeth, making him choke on the awkward positioning of his tongue. Tears rolled down his cheeks as he was lifted and packed into the boot of the car, the last two men now exiting the building and making their way towards the second vehicle, their business was done. The heavy metal door slammed above him, leaving him in darkness. The car hummed along the busy street, conspicuous in every way. Bullet holes littered the panelling, the glass in the windows was smashed and shattered, or missing completely; and yet, there was something about driving this vehicle that made him feel safer than driving a car that was whole. Why? Because only an idiot that was wanted nationally would be seen in a piece of junk as battered as this … He flicked on his indicator, turning down the one-way street leading to the rundown apartments that he called home; the groceries he had purchased rolling off the back seat onto the floor. Damn it, I knew I should have put them in the trunk. He turned to see the damage before a loud blaring horn startled him, his grip on the steering wheel tightening. Turning his attention back to the road ahead he swerved to avoid the cars coming his way, veering onto the dirt and braking hard. The two black Fleetwood Cadillac's accelerated, throwing dust in the air as they passed. He took a moment, coughing from the dirt that was inhaled before looking in his rear-view mirror, the hairs on the back of his neck standing, as he noticed both vehicles were packed with more than four men. A sick feeling washed over him, get back to the others. There was a stillness in the air as he climbed from the car and made his way towards the lobby doors, pushing them open. His footsteps echoed throughout the empty room making his nerves stand on edge, as he waited for Pink to come down stairs at a rapid pace above him, shouting, or swearing, demanding to know where and why he had left. He stood still, but there was no movement, no sound. The unnatural emotion of fear came over him, as he slowly scaled every step in complete silence, his gun drawn and held by his side. On approaching his apartment, he leant against the wall and inhaled deeply, taking note of the blood smeared on the handle. Please god, no… With one finger wrapped around the timber door he pulled it towards himself, placing his left foot inside the dark room. He couldn't see what laid in front of his feet, the curtains drawn closed. \"Paul?\" There was no answer, as he took another blind step onward in the sickening silence, making his way towards a lamp situated on a small wooden table. In lifting his foot it caught on something unknown in the blackness, triggering his body to fall forwards, hands making contact with the wet tiles. A warm liquid smeared over his bare skin as he reached for the light; it flickered on, revealing red splatters on the lampshade and wall. He gulped cuttingly, throat tightening as he turned to face the thin body behind him, bound, and tarnished by the crimson that pooled and soaked through layers of clothing. \"Pink!\" He jumped at his dying friend lifting him off the cold floor, pulling him closer to the warmth that his own body would provide. \"Pink?\" He ran a hand over the front of his torso, searching for the extent of his wounds but found nothing, before relaxing the limp figure against his own chest, his attention now on the ropes holding Roberts's arms forcefully behind his back. Larry picked at the knots, his arms shaking cripplingly as he attempted to free his companion. \"You lay here like this, everything's gonna be fine…\" A rasped pant sounded, as he pulled the ties away from the cold pair of frail hands, Pink's fingers curling inwards weakly. \"You're going to be ok. Pink?\" He shook the man's shoulder harshly, struggling to wake him \"Pink…? Robert, hey…look at me\" A set of blue eyes emerged from beneath thick eyelashes, in a gaze that was distant and unsettled. Please stay awake, please…please. \"Robert please\" Pink lifted his right arm now above White's shoulder supportively, pressing his face into Larry's chest with wanted comfort. He could feel the soft touch of cold fingertips running over the back of his neck, his friends breathing dwindling with every stroke as he became less alert. He pulled him closer into a tight embrace, as Robert panted hesitantly for air; body tensing and writhing in a last fight for life, until the bout of strength ended. He slumped in his arms, the hand around Larry's neck falling still. A stream of tears ran down his face as he arched over the body in his lap, moaning overwhelmingly, gripping the loosely fit clothing of his lifeless companion. Why…[Chapter 19] Thankyou to everyone still following this story! You guys are great! Please leave a review if you have the time, I'll be sure to update the next chapter faster than this! His face came into contact with the concrete, the bindings around his wrists inhibiting movement as the men standing over him closed the boot of the car. A shoe was pressed into his side, as he was rolled onto his back, the bright warehouse lights above making it near impossible to see anything. Silhouettes spoke to one-another calmly, the smell of smoke in the air causing him to cough hastily. \"How you doin' kid? Long car ride huh, I'm sorry I had to shove you in the boot, you could have ridden with us up front but you were squirmin' too much…wouldn't want the cops to pull us over\" The man leant in close, ashing his cigarette over Pauls face causing him to frown. He'd recognise this guy anywhere… \"Nice to see you too Greg, last time we met you had a baseball bat, you're not really that scary without it\" \"Still have a fire in your belly I see, just like your old man, hey? But it's not always a good thing I guess, gets you killed in this job\" Gregory Marino, the slimy no good Italian snake… that was the only way to describe him. Cold, calculating, relentless; Paul had already enjoyed the pleasure of his company, although it seemed like longer than three months ago. \"You're a good looking guy Torisi…I didn't really take pleasure in breaking your face, you know that time your 'Pa' ruined what we had going on with that bank robbery…it was a shame, you would have made a good little thief.\" \"I wouldn't have worked for you cocksuckers anyway…\" The man above him inhaled deeply before scrunching his brow into a tight frown, turning towards the other members of his gang; null and void of all emotion as he fixed his cuffs. \"I have told this little fucker so many times to watch his language and he just can't help himself\" An uncontrollable amount of anger built inside him, a churning feeling in his stomach that made him want to cut the man's throat from ear to ear. Greg stood unconcernedly, responsive but completely undaunted by the fact that he had just murdered a man that didn't deserve to die, a fellow criminal… Pink. It was then a crash of metal on metal shook the ground that he was laid upon, heavy steps closing the distance between himself, and the only man that Paul feared in the room. \"I told you boy…not to meddle with things you didn't know nothing about, and what do you do? Answer me…what did you do wrong?\" Inhaling sharply he could feel the cold stare of Michael Firenze 'Long Beach Mike' watching him, waiting wordlessly for an answer in the now still warehouse. There was the light shuffle of a nervous pair of feet, before the room fell stagnant of all emotion again; one of the gangs members anxious about the events that were to follow his answer to the question. Paul was terrified, teeth chattering together in a movement that he was certain nobody could see, but almost everyone could hear. \"I didn't know it had anything to do with you…\" \"Well it did…and now I have a big problem. The issue is, that I just sold out a major crime boss, valued by his very, very many loyal employees and the one thing that needed to happen was for all involved in that heist to be either gunned down or locked up. Now I'm sure you knew who they were as soon as they showed up at your door… you knew one of them already, remember? From the last time you fucked up one of my major operations!\" He stared blankly before turning away, there was no laughter from the men standing above him as there had been earlier. They were like dogs, waiting for the signal of their master; permission to tear Paul limb from limb. \"I can't deal with this shit today boys, I'm headed to Santa Barbara on important business. Find somewhere to lock him up for the night, keep eyes on him until I get back\" A murmur could be heard from those given the task, as six pairs of feet followed Mike from the room. \"Where are going to lock him? There's nowhere here…\" He found himself looking with them, scanning the room for an appropriate cell of containment but found nothing. The warehouse walls stretched onwards, items upon items lining shelves, car trailers parked closely to the left. Where were they? \"Where the hell are we?\" – he asked shakily as he pulled at his bindings. \"A storage building for a camping shop\" Why would boss choose a camp- \"Hey, hey look over there what's that?\" A taller well-built gang member that he had failed to notice earlier waved a hand now in the direction of a wall lined with various shaped and sized grills, all three men following around the corner, behind a set of shelves out of sight. A ricochet of chatter reached his ears as he pressed his face into the concrete…White would have arrived back to the apartment by now, he would have found Pink. There was deep distressing feeling in the pit of his stomach, Robert was dead, after three shots he had to be. He felt his own face contort, tears forming as the hurried footsteps returned. \"Oh boy do we have an interesting bed for you, boy\" He inhaled deeply, trying his hardest to push the emotion away as a forceful hand grabbed his shoulder and hoisted him from the ground. \"You are going to like this …\" Lifting his feet as he walked was near impossible, all of his strength drained earlier in a desperate and failed attempt to reach his dying friend, as he was dragged from the set of apartments. He was pushed roughly forward by a set of hands, the hit driving into the side of a stomach that was already littered with discoloured patches of skin. Two men grabbed him by the elbows now, as he looked forward to where a large grill revealed itself from the shadows. A fear came over him now, tight locked, small enclosed space. \"You can't put me in there…\" \"Why it's just a pig smoker, perfect for swine like you\" He pressed his heels into the ground firmly as he was dragged along the concrete, in an attempt to slow down or stops his challengers' success. \"Please stop! No I can't be in there, not until tomorrow!\" He kicked out as he was lifted from the ground and tossed onto the grate, the clattering of metal amplified by the half –cylinder cover that would seal him inside. \"Please, anything but this, re-tie my legs and leave me on the floor overnight, I don't care, anything but lock me in here.\" The men all gave him a false look of sympathy, before one of them grasped the cookers handle. \"What's wrong? You a little bit claustrophobic? We did choose the biggest grill, I mean look at that one\" – He pointed away now to a smaller contraption held by four thin metal legs. \"We could have left you in there…Boys show Paul how small the inside of that one is\" There was a loud creak as the lid of the little barbeque eased open slowly. \"You know what boys, I reckon if you took out that metal splitter that holds up the pig, we could fit Mr. Torisi in there…lay him down where the coals are supposed to go, he's complaining about the one we have him in now\" His heart jumped in panic, as the man above him grinned callously. \"Wait! Wait, I like this one…this is good ok, its good\" \"No I insist…\" The metal was beginning to warm now, the grills positioning in the direct light of the afternoon sun, I should have just fucking shut up… Sweat covered his entire body, and a dull aching pain in his head made him want to be able to just sleep, but how could he? The events of the day replayed in his mind. How did they find us so fast? He expected Long beach Mike to be looking for him and hunting him down, but with less proficiency; L.A was a big place, Larry and Robert could have been anywhere...instead they were traced to their exact location, there was no possible way that they had done it on their own. His thoughts were interrupted by a loud rattling bang on the outside of the stove. \"You need water in there?\" He gave a sigh that was one of both relief and worry as the lid of the cooker was opened, a man of thinner build standing over him now. His hands were lifted, a small water bottle placed underneath. \"Can you get that open?\" Paul nodded in reply, the man simply raising an eyebrow at his confidence. \"You sure?\" \"Yeah I'm sure…\" He waited for the heavy metal cover to be closed, encasing him in blackness again; instead, however, the man lingered. \"I was left here to watch you by myself, can you believe that? The other two guys went home. Now I feel bad leaving you in here overnight, because I'm claustrophobic myself, so I'll make you a deal. I'll let you out, and untie you – don't try anything stupid though once I take off the ropes, because I'll fucking shoot. Once you're out you can have dinner, I ordered Chinese…don't really believe in letting a man die on an empty stomach, because I'm sure you were aware that's what's happening tomorrow when Mike gets back\" He raised his eyebrows as the man continued, shocked by the sudden pleasantness of his enemy. \"One once condition…\" \"What's the condition?\" \"In the morning you get back in this cooker, without trying to fight me off and be a hero, and let me re-tie you before the others show up. Because if you don't it won't be just your neck, it'll be mine as well.\" He thought over the conditions, but the decision wasn't a very hard one. Between the choices of small, tiny compact cooker with no food and only a small bottle of water; and Chinese food, untied hands and company for the night, the latter was unquestionably the more comfortable. \"Yeah man you have a deal, just get me the fuck out of here\" \"You'll get back in tomorrow?\" \"You have my word, just, please let me out…\" The man looked into his eyes for the truth in his statement, seemingly satisfied that Paul wasn't lying, before pulling at the ropes. As the bindings around his feet came loose he stretched out his legs that had been doubled over and compacted inside the tiny stove. \"It must be pretty hot in there, I told them to help move you out of the sun so that you wouldn't get heatstroke but the other blokes don't care\" \"So why do you?\" The question was too persistent as he played it over in his mind, but he wanted to know why this man was helping him, if he were caught he would be strung up. \"I just mean, why take that risk?\" \"Why take the risk? Because you're just a kid, I have boys at home a few years younger and I would feel sick knowing that they died left in a metal cooker, from dehydration. No person should have to die that way, but definitely not someone so young…\" He couldn't hold back a small smile as his hands pulled free as well, laying still for a moment in relief. \"Thankyou…\" \"No worries, now get out and pull up a chair, they're over by the tents\" As he climbed from the cooker he ran his hands over his wrists, soothing the rope burns, before making his way towards the camping seats; dragging one over to where the man who released him had set up for the night, the dull sound of a radio playing in the background. He threw himself down into the chair before gasping, remembering only after he had injured them again, the bruises that lined his chest and torso. \"You look like you need some ice on that, your face looks like shit too\" \"Thanks for the uplifting words…\" \"No worries kid, honesty is the best thing sometimes ain't it?\" It felt surreal, having a conversation that was so civil, with a man that was working for Long Beach; earlier in the day he would have never even considered sitting and talking as he was now. \"What's your name? If you're willing to share it I mean…\" The man looked at him for a moment, before taking a sip from his water bottle. \"I don't normally like to tell people my name in this job, but I figure that it's not going to really matter that you know it after tomorrow…\" He extended a hand now, leaning forward. \"My name's Anthony, but just call me Tony\" The telephone rang out once again, Freddy doing his best to ignore the calls of his colleagues from the office, trying to milk him of evidence but giving him no news on White and Pink in return. The ringing buzz began to sound again, the incessant whirring making him want to pull the cord from the wall, bastards won't get any information from me, they don't need my help so they're not going to get it. He leant back in his chair, sifting through the various highlighted pages of his notebook, reading the daily entries he made leading up to the heist. Each and every account involving Larry; they were in each other's pocket for the entirety of the job, and it made him sick to think that he would most likely never get a proper chance to speak with the man and apologise. He should have told him he was a cop, but if he had, he would have been dead, there was no way that they were coming out of the whole ordeal as 'pals'. He sipped at his cup of water again, before prying open the hardened pages that were dried together with his blood. The door rattled suddenly, the knocking making him to force the book into his pocket. \"Freddy let me in\" Tegan's voice projected from the hallway outside, as he stood and made his way to unlock the nine different latches bolting him inside; a touch that Holdaway had added to 'keep him safe from intruders'. As he pulled the pin in the last deadbolt, she pushed her way inside, bags hanging from her arms with assortments of vegetables and healthy 'recovery foods'. He scoured the contents briefly before shivering at the sight of Brussel sprouts and asparagus, this woman's going to fucking kill me… \"Thanks Tegan, how's the case going at the moment, you look a little rattled\" \"I am, we have made no progress at all in finding Dimmick or Pink, they've literally vanished…so has Paul\" He raised his eyebrows, feeling a little frustrated for her. \"I could help you know…I don't mean field work, I just mean documents, looking over evidence. I feel useless knowing there is shit that I could be doing, instead of sitting around and eating all day\" She stared at him with a look that could have meant many different things, before shaking her head; golden strands of hair falling in her eyes. \"God damn it Freddy, no. That was the deal of you being released, you could come home but no stress and no work\" \"Tegan, I'm more stressed not knowing anything, you and Holdaway completely removing me from what's going on is causing me more harm than good. Evidence files aren't going to fucking kill me, and I might pick up shit that you guys are missing.\" She stood now with a hand on her hip, the phone ringing loudly again. \"Please, I want to help, that's the only way I can right now…\" She pressed her face into her hand before making her way to the phone. \"Residence of Freddy Newendyke, Tegan speaking\" Immediately she engaged in conversation, the caller most likely Holdaway. He sat on the couch towards the front of the apartment, situated beside the windows, not really wanting to speak with his boss at this point. \"…no well I was thinking we could get some evidence brought over for him though, he's bored out of his mind…no not an enormous amount, just enough to keep him busy… you know we need his help.\" He stared in her direction now, a mix of disbelief and gratitude, finally she got my point. \"I'll stop in at the station when I'm done here and drop it to him tomorrow…ok, see you then Jim.\" Walsh turned to face him, a smile covering most of her face as she strolled to where he was seated, throwing herself down onto the worn sofa. Leaning towards him she rested her head on his shoulder; Freddy returning the gesture. \"Holdaway really doesn't want you to have those files, he thinks you're too wounded still\" \"What do you think?\" She ran her hand over his chest before resting it above the bandaged injury inflicted by Joe Cabot's gun. \"I think, that if I give you these documents you'll probably stay awake for days until you figure it out…but that's the kind of determination we need to solve the puzzle of where Pink and Dimmick are\" They both sat in silence for a moment, the warm embrace being something Freddy missed. Before he had taken up the job the two had been close, but their relationship was strange now, as though she was afraid to touch him, scared to look him in the eyes. \"You know me too well\" \"I do, that's why I was thinking, if it's ok with you that I might stay here for a couple of weeks. I can keep you updated on the case then, so long as you don't tell Holdaway, and you can assist me when I need help to go over evidence…\" He held her at arms lengths now, a smile on his face. \"Really?\" \"I think it's a good idea don't you?\" \"I think it's a fucking great idea\" \"Well that's settled then, I'll go home tonight and pack some stuff, get the case files from the office and come over tomorrow…say, midday?\" As she rose from the couch he stood with her, escorting her to the door, a dull ache making it apparent to him that he should have remained seated. The pain faded slowly as he leant on the entrance and watched her pick up her belongings from the table, before she gently strolled past him, giving him a peck on the cheek. \"See you then, look after yourself ok?\" \"Ok\" As her heels clicked away down the hall he closed the door, bolting each and every one of the locks that were screwed into the timber. There was a joy radiating from him that he had not felt since weeks leading up to the heist, that's things might just be going his way again. The solid pavement jarred his knees as he made hefty steps towards a set of large glass doors, his body could falter at any moment; never before had grief made him feel this weak. Pink made no movement, no flutter of an eyelid, no twitch of a finger; his friends icy skin stunning him each time it made contact with his own. He could hear distant noise drumming in his ears as he continued ahead, pushing his way into the busy, brightly lit hall; the screams of women and the echo of running feet overwhelmed his ears as he fell forwards, lying Robert on the cold hospital tiles. Choking back tears he tossed his gun, the metal scraping along the floor, coming to a stop after colliding with the base of the hospital visitor desk. He gasped with the pain of the situation, the man's pale form in front of him; shakily he buttoned Pinks sodden shirt before pulling his comb from his own jacket. Attempting to neaten the knotted strands was useless, the lengths of normally tidy hair, dishevelled and infused together with a heavy amount of partially dried blood. He wept at his inability to arrange the loose threads of hair, before stroking the exit wound bordering the thin man's collarbone. \"Pink… I'm fucking sorry, I should have been there\" Down the hall a receptionist screeched for help, an approaching pattering of feet caused him to lift his own hands above his head feebly, chest trembling. The clattering wheels of a metal trolley resounded in the empty white passageway as three paramedics ran to his departed companions' aid, lifting him onto the bed. As Robert's lifeless arm hung outstretched in Whites direction an item fell from between the thin bloodied fingers, creating a loud, and high-pitched sound; rolling towards him leaving a thin crimson trail, Freddy's ring… ","Summary":" Ok, so this fanfiction is in a completely new area for me, but Reservoir Dogs is one of my favorite"},{"Movie":"Warrior, 2011","Title":"Day By Day","Author":"AyersIris","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8279809","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I own nothing! Chapter 1 They'd wanted to send him back. To finish his tour of duty. In the end it was his dislocated shoulder that saved him, the military tribunal deciding that by the time he was fit for service again he would have served his whole sentence behind bars, and public opinion would not allow a war hero- however unconventional, to go to jail. In the end Tommy spent six months on a military base running drills while his shoulder healed before being honorably discharged from the army with the sounds of Sparta still ringing in his ears. January 14 th Rain lashed down, beating against the windscreen of the second-hand Ford as Tommy maneuvered it one handed around the last bend before pulling into his brother's driveway. Turning off the engine he sat for a few moments and breathed deeply. It wouldn't be the first time he'd spoken to Brendan since his tap-out in Sparta but it was close. The brothers had shared a moment together in the hospital after Tommy's shoulder was set, Brendan couldn't stop apologizing until Tommy could have hit him again out of frustration. Brendan, hey Brendan stop. He remembered trying to make himself heard over his brother's distress Hey, Brendan, it's okay. I'm okay. Tommy rested his good hand on Brendan's arm, just over a fresh bruise in the shape of his own fist. Guilt, fed on the remnants of his anger gnawed at his gut. It's not okay Tommy- Its really not. Its not. I'm so sorry. Its …. the bank was going to take our house and… what was I going to tell the girls? Brendan shook his head sadly. Girls? Asked Tommy, roughly, the pain medication was starting to make his head spin. Yeah, smiled Brendan, Tommy remembered how his brother's face suddenly lit up at the mention of his daughters. Yeah, I told you last night, Emily and Rosie? They're eight and six. I'd like you to meet them… Tommy gave him a skeptical look. At some point. After that there hadn't been much time to talk. Two military policemen had taken Tommy into custody and straight from hospital to a military base where he was put on trial. Brendan phoned him when he was allowed to and Tommy had even spoken to his nieces on the phone; their tiny pixie voices barely audible over the crackling of static. He pulled himself together and got out of the car. He only had one duffle bag of clothes, the rest was still at his father's house not that there was much else. He shouldered the bag on his good side and mounted the steps to the front door. He stood there for a few moments before knocking, The door opened a few inches seemingly of its own accord; it took a while for Tommy to realize that the person standing on the other side was just significantly smaller than he was. He looked down and saw a small girl with Brendan's dark eyes and two blonde pigtails, staring up at him in amazement. \"Hi\" he said, lamely. \"Who are you? I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.\" Tommy smiled slightly \"I'm your uncle, Tommy. We've spoken before, on the phone. Is your dad here?\" \"Yeah…\" then she turned and called into the house behind her \"Daaadyy Daaadyy! Its Uncle Tomyyyyy!\" Moments later, Brendan appeared and scooped the little girl up into his arms before removing the safety chain from the door and puling Tommy into a fierce one-armed hug. Tommy stiffened for a moment at his touch, unused to any kind of affection but after a moment he reciprocated. As they broke apart he saw that Brendan's eyes were very bright. \"Come on in\" said Brendan, roughly. The house had obviously seen some of the money that Brendan had won from Sparta, everything was freshly painted, and there were nice dark floorboards in the hall. Tommy, feeling uncomfortable, wondered if he should have come at all. \"So,\" said Brendan, setting the girl down as he led Tommy into the kitchen, \"How long have you been out?\" \"Got out today.\" Tommy replied, ducking his head down to avoid looking his brother in the eyes. It felt wrong to admit, even now that he had nowhere else to go. \"Well, how about we make up the guest bed later. Do you want something to eat? Or-\" Brendan was about to offer him coffee when Tommy cut him off. \"Is it alright? That I'm here? I mean, it's been a long time, and last time we saw each other it didn't really go so great. If you want me to leave… I mean, I've got other places I can go…\" Brendan smiled sadly but not, he was relieved to see, with pity. \"Come on, I'll get the sheets. And we can introduce you properly to the girls.\" \"Okay.\" The relief was almost palpable in the air. They were in the utility room and Brendan was up on a stepladder looking for the sheets to the spare bed before they spoke again. \"Where's Tess?\" asked Tommy. \"In Portland, her sister's just had a baby wouldn't you believe it….\" Brendan held up a sheet and, deeming it to be the right one, threw it down to Tommy who awkwardly caught it, \"Alright… she was there, at Sparta wasn't she?\" \"Yeah, couldn't convince her to come at first but, she came around in the end- she always hated watching the fights.\" \"Can't think that she'll be too pleased to see me then\" remarked Tommy, a slight smile in his voice. \"That's different… anyway, I beat you.\" Brendan got off the stepladder and took the sheets from Tommy, ushering him into the hall. \"So you did…. So you did. \" Sitting on the couch and watching SpongeBob on TV, the two little girls were waiting for them as Tommy and Brendan returned from the utility room. Two pairs of big brown eyes followed Tommy's every movement. \"Emily, Rosie, come say hello.\" Encouraged Brendan. Cautiously both girls slid off the couch and approached. Tommy crouched down so that he wouldn't tower over them and held out a hand for them to shake. The older one took it, smiling shyly. \"I'm Emily\" she said in the tiny pixie voice that Tommy remembered from the phone calls. \"And you're eight years old right?\" asked Tommy. Wondering what the hell else he was supposed to say. \"I'm gonna be nine in two weeks.\" She replied proudly. \"And then you'll be really grown up?\" \"Yes, absolutely.\" \"And what about you sweetie?\" he asked, turning to Rosie who was hiding slightly behind her sister. \"I'm Rosie, I'm six… you're really big and scary…\" she trailed of in a whisper. \"I'm not that big Rosie, you're just very small\" The little girls smiled, seeming to like this explanation. \"Come on girls, its almost bed time.\" Said Brendan, much to Tommy's relief. The four of them trooped into the kitchen where Tommy watched his brother make warm milk for both the girls before sending them upstairs with the promise of a story later. \"How's the shoulder?\" was the first question Brendan asked upon his return from settling the girls. \"S'ok\" replied Tommy, not wanting Brendan to know just how badly it was hurting him. \"I saw you favoring it today, still hurts doesn't it.\" \"It's fine Brendan. Leave it.\" He ducked his head further, studying his fingernails. \"It's not fine Tommy, I think you need to get it checked out.\" \"Need a job first.\" \"Oh, right, no army insurance…. I could-\" Tommy cut him off. \"No Brendan, you've done enough… I know about the money you sent to Pilar and her kids.\" \"Oh, right…\" Brendan seemed at a loss for words. He wiped down the bench and put some dishes in the sink. \"So you entered Sparta for them?\" Tommy didn't answer for a long moment, he fished a toothpick out of his pocket and rolled it between his full lips. \"Yes and no… the money was for them, the fight was for me.\" \"Right. So it's okay then- that I sent them the money?\" Tommy didn't answer, just stared at his hands. \"I wish I'd been the one to do it. I owe Manny my life.\" His voice was rougher than before and Brendan saw his shoulders tense slightly. Brendan crossed the room in a few long strides and put his arm around Tommy, pulling him into an awkward sideways hug. For a few seconds Tommy froze at the touch before patting Brendan on the back in return. For a moment Brendan felt that he was properly fulfilling his big brother duties, that even after the terrible events of their childhood, theirs could still be a relationship worth salvaging, that not all their bridges had been burned. He smiled down at Tommy who was examining his fingernails with increased diligence. \"Ready to go to bed?\" Brendan asked him. \"Yeah,\" Tommy's voice had returned to normal and he gave Brendan a rare half-smile. January 15 th It was at about three in the morning that Brendan woke, his ears pricked. He'd heard a strange noise coming from downstairs. As he relaxed almost into sleep again he heard the noise a second time. A strangled cry of fear. Tommy. Brendan was out of bed in seconds, he checked on the girls as he passed their room down the hall but they were both still sleeping peacefully. Brendan reached the guestroom downstairs and listened for a moment, hoping that maybe the nightmare had passed but from the other side of the door came a sob and then another, a low rasping sound. Brendan quietly pushed open the door and, without thinking at all, he grabbed Tommy by both shoulders and shook him awake. Tommy's immediate yell of agony told his brother all he needed to know about the state of his shoulder. He was drenched in a cold sheen of sweat, dark hair sticking to his forehead. His eyes, wild and unseeing, focused slowly on Brendan as his breathing returned to normal. Up close, Brendan could see that his face was streaked with tears. \"What was that for?\" Tommy asked in an outraged whisper, cradling his left shoulder. \"Sorry, I'm really sorry. You were having a nightmare…\" Tommy's eyes clouded. \"I'm fine,\" He said in a monotone, sitting up. \"The hell you are Tommy.\" Brendan whispered, reaching out he scrubbed some of the tear tracks from his brother's face. Tommy flinched and then touched his cheek, surprised to find it wet with tears. \"I was crying?\" he asked. \"Looks like….\" Smiled Brendan ruefully through the dark. \"Sorry,\" \"Don't be. Don't be Tommy.\" They sat in the dark in silence for a moment whilst Tommy's breathing rate slowly returned to normal. \"Go back to sleep Brendan\" he said, quietly. \"I'm fine.\" \"Not a chance, come on.\" He dragged Tommy out of bed and threw him a T-shirt, which he caught one handed. Tommy put it on, somewhat awkwardly; his shoulder was obviously not functioning well at all. Brendan felt guilt twist in his gut. He led Tommy into the kitchen and flicked on the lights. \"Go on, sit yourself down.\" Brendan started rummaging through the fist aid-kit he kept under the sink. Tommy sat, staring into space, shivering slightly in the cool air as the cold sweat evaporated off his body. Without his big sweater on, Brendan could see that he'd lost a lot of weight since Sparta maybe ten or even twenty pounds of muscle had simply wasted away. With the dark circles under his eyes and a days worth of stubble on his cheeks, Tommy looked quite ill. \"Here\" Brendan thrust a tube of \"Deep Heat\" warming gel into his hands. Tommy stared at it for a moment as though unsure what it was for. \"Tommy.\" Brendan clicked his fingers in front of his eyes trying to get a reaction from him. He sat up as though someone had electrocuted him. \"Yeah?\" \"The gel, put it on your shoulder. I'm coming with you to get it checked out tomorrow.\" \"Told you I can't afford it.\" \"Then your going to be paying me back because we're going to the clinic tomorrow.\" \"God. Okay . You sound like mom.\" Brendan grinned \"I'm going to go right ahead and take that as a compliment.\" Tommy nodded absently, applying the gel clumsily. They sat in silence while Tommy rubbed it in not wincing although Brendan could tell it was still hurting him. \"D'you want to talk about it?\" he asked. \"Not really.\" Tommy replied and replaced the cap on the bottle. \"D'you want me to make up the couch for you?\" \"I'm not twelve years old any more Brendan,\" muttered Tommy but he did smile ever so slightly. When they were young Tommy used to ask Brendan to swap beds with him every time he had a nightmare thinking that his bed was the cause of the nighttime distress. The thought of a twelve-year-old Tommy, already a state wrestling champion but tiny in comparison to the seventeen-year-old Brendan, shaking him awake night after night shivering, panicking but trying to be brave still haunted Brendan. The guilt he felt in his abandonment stirring anew. \"I know you're not Tommy. I know.\" Tommy smiled slightly at him and seemed on the brink of saying something. Then his eyes clouded over and he dropped his head to stare at his hands again. \"What's up?\" Brendan asked, nipping into the spare bedroom to get Tommy's duvet and pillows to put on the couch. Tommy watched him impassively for a moment before hopping off his stool to help him. \"I was dreaming about Iraq. The night Manny died. You kinda remind me of him.\" \"I do?\" \"Yeah… or maybe he reminded me of you… I dunno. He loved his wife, kids, was calling out for them when he died.\" Brendan didn't really have anything to say to that so he spread the duvet on the couch having brushed aside Tommy's offer of help and helped him to get settled in. \"Don't worry if the girls come down, they like to watch SpongeBob before school but I'll tell them to be quiet. Okay?\" \"Yeah- Brendan-\" \"What?\" \"Thank you.\" A/N: Thanks for reading please review xx[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I own nothing (except my oc!) Chapter 2 January 15th Katrina heard the door close and flopped, exhausted onto her bed. The \"Great Move\" was finally over and the last moving man out of her apartment taking his cigarettes with him. It was a shame; she could have done with a cigarette. The floor all around the bed was littered with boxes, which right now she could honestly not be bothered to unpack. \"Man up\" she said to herself \"The sooner you start the sooner you finish.\" And with that rousing thought she picked up her Stanley knife and attacked the fist box, almost cutting her hand open in the process. \"Great\" she said aloud. \"Books.\" The next few boxes didn't yield many better results, kitchen utensils, dried food and flour, shoes, bedding. After an hour of patient unpacking, one fight with a flat pack dresser and she was just about done. All that remained was to get her clothes together for the next day, take a shower (once she figured how to get the hot water working) and call her best friend Casey. You really made it! Thought Katrina doing a little jig around her kitchen in excitement and almost spilling her fresh cup of tea down her front. Tomorrow was her fist day at work as a soloist with the Pittsburgh Ballet. Junior soloist she reminded herself, then grinned involuntarily stopping incase someone looked through the window and thought she was a lunatic. She then remembered that she'd just been dancing around in front of the fridge so the whole lunatic thing was already in the bag. Katrina had finally made it out of the corps de ballet position at the Joffrey Ballet Company this year owing to a stroke of luck, in truth, luck for her and misfortune for the last Pittsburgh ballet junior soloist who'd been hit by a car. Luckily for the soloist, she'd only broken her leg in one place but was still out of the company for at least two seasons. Luckily for Katrina, instead of promoting one of their own dancers to the coveted spot of junior soloist the Pittsburgh Ballet had advertised for an open audition. Seeing the advertisement online Katrina hopped on the first Greyhound bus she could find from Chicago and auditioned. She hadn't expected or even dared to hope to get the job, she didn't even let herself think about it, she was too young, too inexperienced, she wasn't even a soloist at the Joffrey. She didn't hope or pray for a letter of acceptance, just filed the audition away in her mind under \"Learning Experience\". Then two months ago, in the middle of her lunch break as they were rehearsing for that night's performance of The Nutcracker she got a call on her cell phone from an unknown number. Fifteen minutes later she'd handed in her notice for the end of the season and was searching for affordable flats in Pittsburgh. Her friends made her promise to call as soon as she'd arrived and settled in. It was hard to leave them, the girls she'd grown up with whilst attending the Joffrey Ballet School and later working with them in the company, but Katrina was excited to be striking out on her own. The sun was starting the lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the city. From her fifth floor apartment Katrina could see a pretty good view across the center of Pittsburgh. She wondered if she could see the ballet center from here. The apartment, though having a good view, also had a cheap monthly rent owing mainly to its miniscule size. Made up only of two rooms; a bathroom and a living room with kitchen area and an open mezzanine level for the bedroom, which was really just a platform near the ceiling with a bed on it. The space under the stairs cleverly concealed clothes storage and a boiler. When she was running her bath Katrina had noticed a strange rattling coming from the boiler and promptly moved her best clothes out of the cupboard and into her dresser incase of a leak. Suddenly she jumped up and ran up to her bedroom. Grabbing her cell phone she started going through her contacts looking for her friend Casey before realizing that she was on speed dial. She rang and heard Casey's jokey ringer ID of the \"Spice Girls\" play for five minutes, before giving up and vowing to call later. Typical of Casey to not pick up when she'd made Katrina swear to call on pain of death. Her bath, she decided, must be full by now. Going down stairs she turned off the water and got out her shampoo, it was a hair washing night. Katrina turned for a moment and gave herself a good look in the mirror over the sink. Dark brown eyes stared back at her from a tanned and freckled face. Her thick brown hair fell, slightly greasy from the day's efforts, just to the points of her shoulder blades. It was really the only length she could have it anyway, too long and it wouldn't go into a bun, too short and she needed a whole can of hairspray to control the fly-aways. She ran a hand threw it and immediately regretted it; her hair really needed a wash. A/N Thanks so much for reading! Please R&R; XXX[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I own nothing Chapter 3 January 15th The next day Tommy woke unusually late. Sunlight was pouring through the windows at the front of the house as he untangled himself from the depths of the couch and stood, clicking his back and rolling his shoulders. The left one was very sore and he winced slightly as he moved it. The girls and Brendan had obviously already gone to school and the house was silent. Tommy checked his watch, twelve thirty. Shit. He didn't really have any plans for the day or a clear idea about where he wanted to go next. All his thoughts after his discharge from the Marines were about escaping and getting as far away from Camp Georgeas possible in a single drive. He wasn't sure what made him think of Brendan as his first port of call. At this point, he thought bitterly, Brendan was his only port of call, unless you counted Pilar or his dad. It pained him to think how many friends he'd lost on the day Manny died, everyone close to him, the people he could have counted on to stay with on the day of his discharge. He hadn't been to a single one of their funerals, being on the run at the time; traveling slowly back from Iraq, then laying low and erasing any trace of Thomas Conlan's identity. Occasionally in the first few weeks he would see their pictures on the news, videos of grieving parents and wives, the convoy of coffins being repatriated. He'd tried not to watch, seen too much already. Tommy gloomily poured himself a glass of water. He looked over to his duffle bag on the floor. There were several bottles of pills inside, prescribed to him by the army doctor for the recurring nightmares and other symptoms of what he was now being told was \"post traumatic stress disorder\". There was also pain medication for his shoulder, which, as Brendan had guessed, hadn't set well after Sparta. The drills his sergeant had set him at the camp hadn't helped much either. Tommy hadn't minded much at the time; he was no stranger to pain or exhaustion and pushing his body past its limits had helped to block out some of the sharper pain. Seeing his father relapse after over one thousand days of sobriety when he, Tommy was to blame, the pain of seeing Brendan again, being torn so completely between hating the man and missing him. And of course, the shame of failure, loosing Sparta to Brendan; not being able to win for the family who'd supported him, cared for him and taken him in. Tommy sighed, glancing at the duffle bag again before crossing the room and pulling out the orange pill bottles. The pills winked at him in the light. Tempting. But, he'd already been down that road, relying on sleeping pills and anti-depressants to get him through the day before he started training for Sparta had brought him low. He loathed addiction and despised the addicted, and by extension, himself. Opening all the bottles he emptied each one down the sink and then quickly ran the garbage disposal. His shoulder throbbed again and he looked down, there was still one painkiller left, stuck to the side of the bottle gritting his teeth he put it down the sink too. He sighed and rested his head in his hands tired all over again. The rest of the day was spent surfing daytime TV channels and walking. Tommy had discovered at Camp George that walking was pretty much the only activity that didn't jolt his shoulder and so did it as much of it as he could. The cold January air felt good against his face, clearing his head at last. He didn't wear his coat or even a sweater as the cold also numbed his shoulder. When it got to three thirty he turned back, heading for Brendan's house and wondering when he would be home. As it turned out Brendan beat him back. As Tommy turned into the cul de sac he saw Brendan's car in the driveway. The TV was tuned on to the news with the sound turned down; Rosie and Emily were sitting in the kitchen at the breakfast island with cups of juice. \"Hey, I wondered where you were.\" Said Brendan, turning to smile at him. Tommy chuckled to see that he was wearing bright yellow marigold gloves and doing the washing up. Toughest guy in the world, yeah right. \"Went for a walk\" he said, \"Could only stand so much daytime TV.\" \"Dr. Phil not doing it for you?\" \"Not so much.\" Tommy smiled. Rosie slammed down her juice cup. \"Daddy! How come uncle Tommy can watch TV in the day and we can't? And he can watch Dr. Phil? I love that show!\" The look of outrage on the eight year old's face had both men in stiches. \"Well honey\" said Brendan between chuckles, \"Tommy is a grown up so I can't tell him how much TV to watch, and, even though you might like Dr. Phil its just a little too grown up for right now.\" \"Arg.\" Grumped Rosie, pouring herself more juice, \"I hate being little. Just you wait, one day me and Rosie will boss you guys around.\" \"Rosie and I \" corrected Brendan, ruffling her hair and having his hand swatted immediately. Tommy took a glass from the cupboard and helped himself to some juice sitting opposite the girls at the counter. \"So, how was school?\" he asked. \"Totally lame.\" Answered Rosie. \"I got cast as a carrot in the school pageant.\" \"A carrot?\" Tommy's eyebrows shot towards his hairline \"Its harvest themed\" \"Right… what's a pageant anyway?\" he asked. Rosie sighed as though he'd asked how the Internet worked. \"You dress up as a harvest character and then you say some lines about how you're \"healthy\" or \"historical\" or something. Lame.\" She had a lot of attitude for an eight year old thought Tommy, must come her father's side. \"And you're a healthy harvest vegetable?\" \"Absolutely, not like Emily. She's a turnip. That's historical .\" Historical was obviously her new word for the day and she still had some trouble pronouncing it. \"So what's historical about a turnip Emily?\" Tommy asked the shy six year old. \"Ummm… I think they were invented by the Indians.\" Rosie nudged her. \" Native Americans !\" she stage whispered. \"Native American Indians, yeah… they invented them and then gave them to the pilgrims for Thanksgiving.\" Emily said with conviction. \"Interesting, what else did the Native Americans invent?\" \"Turkeys?\" asked Emily. \"Don't be silly! God invented turkeys!\" chided Rosie. Tommy couldn't stifle a snort of laughter. \"What?\" Asked both girls together. But Tommy just smiled and shook his head. \"Nothing, I'm just gonna go help your dad wash up.\" Standing, he took his cup over to the sink, noticing as he did so that he'd carelessly left all the empty pill bottles on the sideboard that morning. \"They're cute.\" he said to Brendan who nodded. \"You're good with them, when did that happen?\" \"I dunno, spent a lot of time with Pilar and Manny's kids when… y'know.\" \"Yeah, well, they like you. Rosie likes adults who don't treat her like a baby.\" \"She's got a bit of an attitude on 'er.\" \"Oh yeah, I think that comes from Tess.\" \"Nope, that's definitely all you. Anyway-\" he picked up a napkin and started drying dishes \"I was thinking, I like it here but it's your house and I can't crash here forever-\" \"You know you can stay as long as you like, really its fine.\" \"No, Brendan, it's a small house and you need your guest room, I was going to say that since I got my severance pay I could rent an apparent somewhere 'round here?\" \"Or you could stay here and save your money…?\" Tommy raised an eyebrow and Brendan took that as a sign to drop it \"I'm just sayin'.\" Tommy smiled, breaking the tension. \"Do you actually know of any rental places around here?\" \"Nope, I was hoping you could help out?\" \"Do I look like I'm house hunting?\" Brendan whipped the cream napkin out of Tommy's hands before he ruined it completely and replaced it with a tea-towel \"Alright, maybe not. \" \"You need to think about where is going to be affordable and convenient, do you know what kind of job you're thinking about applying for?\" \"Fighting.\" Tommy replied firmly. \"Okay, do you know what job you're thinking about in the months leading up to when your shoulder is remotely healed enough for you to fight again?\" Tommy sighed, \"No.\" \"Hmm, I'll ask Frank, his gym got put on the map after Sparta and from what he's been telling me, maybe he could do with someone to work at the gym?\" \"You'd talk to him for me?\" \"I don't think he'll need too much convincing, as long as he gets to train you.\" \"Y'think?\" \"I know. Trust me, he's a good guy and anyway, not I'm out of the game you might just be the best middle weight on the planet.\" Brendan smiled but Tommy was studying his shoes. \"I don't know about that any more, lost a lot of form being at Camp George… about ten pounds of muscle.\" \"Yeah, I saw that, were you thinking of moving down a weight class?\" \"Nah, I just couldn't eat. Shoulder was hurting; my pride was hurting, I dunno, being at the Camp was like moving backwards. Just didn't care much about keeping the muscle on at the time.\" Brendan patted him on his good shoulder. \"I'll call Frank tonight.\" \"Thanks…\" January 16th As today was Saturday everyone in the house could have a sleep in, all the adults anyway. Tommy woke at eight to find the TV on and the girls sitting by the couch, watching SpongeBob and eating cereal. There was cereal spilt all over the counter and Tommy swept it up before heading into the bathroom for a shower and shave. He still had the jar-head haircut the marines had given him at Camp George, he ran his hands over his scalp for a moment, feeling the scar at the back where he'd caught a piece of flying shrapnel years ago. Rubbing his eyes, he tried to get rid of the dark circles that seemed to have become a permanent fixture. After his shower he looked at himself in the mirror for a moment. His tattoos were stretched blackly over a chest that was several inches smaller than it had been six months ago. His ribs stuck out when he breathed, how much work would it take to get back to fighting weight he wondered, maybe he really should go down a weight class. When he emerged fully dressed into the kitchen he came across Brendan, still in sweats, making some toast. He had his laptop open on the counter and waved Tommy over to show him something. \"How about this one?\" he asked, showing him an apartment listing. Tommy scrolled down to take a proper look. It certainly was affordable, and close enough to Frank's gym that he wouldn't have to drive. \"It looks really good Brendan, where'd you find this?\" he asked. \"Oh y'know just some casual googling.\" \"We'll have to see what Frank thinks of me working at the gym first.\" \"Yeah, about that, I called him.\" Tommy's eyebrows shot up. \"That was fast.\" \"Yep. Anyway, he said he'd have time to talk today at about twelve.\" \"Twelve… okay cool, thanks Bren….\" Tommy scratched the back of his neck in the way that told Brendan instantly that he was nervous. \"You worried?\" \"Yeah… It's gonna take some work to get me back to middle weight.\" \"It'll happen Tommy, I know you. It'll happen.\" Tommy grunted noncommittally. Because of Tommy's shoulder, which Brendan was convinced needed to be strapped again, Brendan ended up driving the pair of them the half-hour to Frank's gym on the outskirts of Pittsburgh. The brothers didn't talk much in the car; Tommy, clamming up with nerves turned the radio up loud and looked out the window the whole way. Brendan knew better than to press him into talking, and concentrated on the radio announcer's soothing voice. Pulling into the street and but not seeing any parking spaces, Brendan turned to Tommy. \"Go in now or you'll be late. I'll be right behind you.\" Tommy nodded in silent agreement and hopped out of the car, heading for the gym. Stopping for a moment outside the gym, Tommy noticed the size of the place. It was certainly a contrast to Colt Boyd's gym where he had trained for Sparta. He made a mental note to visit Colt when he next went into downtown Pittsburgh, the man had been good to him and they'd spoken occasionally when he was finishing his service up north. Frank Campana's gym was if anything larger on the inside; an open-plan warehouse which had been converted for the purpose. Tommy noted how it had been carefully divided into different sections; one for professional training and one for casual. There were practice rings were set on raised platforms in the center of the warehouse, two already occupied. Tommy recognized one of the fighters as \"Midnight\" who he'd seen Brendan knock out in Sparta. Tommy walked swiftly down the isle between ranks of men doing drills and weights and knocked on the door of Frank's office. He kept his head down, trying not to be recognized, he'd had a few people ask for his autograph at Sparta and in the days following it and had found it dreadfully embarrassing. \"Come on in!\" Called a voice from inside the office. Tommy pushed the door open and entered. \"Hey Tommy\" said Frank, standing and extending a hand for him to shake. Tommy did so and then sat down when invited, he instantly regretted this, feeling the urge to fidget but suppressing it. \"So,\" Frank, smiling broadly. \"Nice place you got here.\" Interjected Tommy, hoping to get proceedings off on the right foot. \"Thanks\" said Frank, genuinely pleased. \"So Brendan said you were looking to get back in the cage.\" \"That's the plan, yeah.\" Frank regarded Tommy for a moment, frowning. \"But you need a job too?\" Tommy nodded; Brendan seemed to have filled him in on the situation. \"Cool. Okay. Were going to need to talk about terms, and some specifics- hours and stuff.\" Tommy's eyebrows nearly disappeared into his hairline. \"Okay? Just like that?\" \"Uh, yeah. You're one of the best MMA fighters in the world at last count as well as my best friend's brother, so yeah, I'll train you.\" Frank chuckled slightly. \"You do want the job don't you?\" \"Yeah, yeah I do.\" \"That's alright then. Although-\" Frank regarded him again, appraisingly. \"How much weight have you lost since Sparta?\" he asked. \"About 20 pounds I think.\" \"Shit\" Frank's brown eyes widened in surprise. \"How the hell did that happen? Did the Marines have you running marathons or something?\" Tommy smiled ruefully \"Not quite, just wasn't eating like I used to, wasn't training so…\" \"Well that's got to stop, how's the shoulder by the way?\" Tommy frowned, \"Not too good, Brenan recons it needs to be set again but I told him he's fussin'.\" \"Here\" Frank jumped up and motioned for Tommy to come around the desk, \"Lets see it.\" He tested Tommy's range of motion, had him do a bit of shadow boxing against his hands and noticed the Marine's jaw clench with pain after the third jab. \"He's right you know, it does needs to be re-set. When are you getting it done?\" \"I dunno, soon.\" Frank looked stern \"Okay very soon.\" \"Good, were gonna need you around back to your best to beat the hell out of \"Midnight\" before his head gets too big for his shoulders.\" Frank his eyes, pointing to Midnight sparring out of the office window. Tommy's eyes lit up with interest at the promise of a fight. \"Yeah? How come he's here anyway? I thought he trained in Chicago?\" \"Well, after Brendan took him out of Sparta in the first round he came here, see if he couldn't learn a bit from the Beethoven.\" Frank grinned. Just then the door opened and in came Brendan, red faced from the cold. \"Hey Frank, how's it going?\" he asked clapping him on the back. \"Its good, just found me a new fighter.\" \"Who?\" asked Brendan, looking about as though someone might appear from the woodworks, Tommy chuckled softly and Brendan caught on. \"Oh. Right. Good one Franko.\" He teased in return. Frank returned behind his desk to print out a copy of his employee contract. Tommy took it and read it over for a moment whilst Frank showed Brendan a few of his newest additions to the \"hall of fame\". Tommy looked over the contract; it gave Frank a manager's fee taken out of the winnings and a percentage of any endorsement deals that Tommy might accrue over the course of his fighting for the gym. Fair enough thought Tommy, he took up a pen from Frank's desk and signed it. A/N please review![Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I own nothing! Chapter 4 January 17th The number 81B bus pulled up at a busy stop on Liberty Avenue and Katrina had to fight to get off before it pulled away again. She weaved skillfully through the crowd of people pushing in the other direction, narrowly avoiding pushchairs and umbrellas. It was raining heavily and she sprinted the last hundred meters to the entrance of the ballet center. It was a large red-brick building, resplendent with royal blue \"Ballet Pittsburgh\" flags which now hung limply in the rain. Checking the address one last time, she pushed open the double doors and entered. Inside the cool, quiet hall, a blonde receptionist, lit cigarette glowing in her manicured fingers asked for identification. Katrina pulled out her driver's license and showed it to the receptionist who stubbed out her cigarette and checked the license under the light, lipsticked lips pursing. \"Seems fine, go on in to the office on the left.\" She said, pointing. \"Thanks, I'm Katrina by the way-\" she tried to make a good first impression. The lips pursed again, worse than before, she's going to get wrinkles if she carries on like that thought Katrina. \"I'm Josie Lawrence.\" She said unsmilingly \"Nice to meet you.\" Silence was the stern reply so Katrina smiled in what she dearly hopped was a winning way and sped past the desk into the corridor. Katrina found the office on the left and knocked tentatively. \"Come in!\" came an accented voice from inside. Katrina crept in and almost freezing on the spot at the sight of the man standing by the window. Knowing instantly who he was, she nearly leapt out of her skin. The man was Dorian Toulouse the infamous director of the famed Paris Opera Ballet. Tall, and broad across the shoulders like a rower with a shock of pewter grey hair and proudly Roman features so still and statue like, he resembled a bronzed Zeus. The man was reputed to be one of the greatest womanizers in the dance world, its enfant terrible and its most beloved star. Only having seen him in photographs Katrina was struck dumb by his presence and rooted to the spot. What the hell is he doing in Pittsburgh ? Wondering in a panic, Katrina blushed to the sodden roots of her hair. The man sitting behind the desk coughed and Katrina realized she'd been staring rudely. She felt the heat rise further in her cheeks. The man behind the desk was Daniel Klein director of the Pittsburgh Ballet and her new boss. He was very like Dorian Toulouse, the same air of aristocracy and intensity; he had a harshly beautiful face, slightly weathered with age but with sharp, dark eyes and hair untouched by grey. At the moment those sharp eyes were turned on Katrina who blushed yet harder, feeling her ears turning red. \"Hello, I'm Katrina Christiansen, the new junior soloist?\" she ventured at last. \"Yes. We've met before. When I gave you the job.\" \"Yes\" If she blushed anymore she would spontaneously combust. Thankfully Daniel smiled at her, the edges of his eyes crinkling slightly, he was what her friend Casey would have called a \"silver fox\". \"So, today is your fist day, nervous?\" Katrina could only nod dumbly. Dorian Toulouse turned towards her, leaning on the edge the desk; Katrina felt the scrutiny of his gaze. \"Well,\" Daniel Klein lent forward eyes fixed on her, \"You're not dancing for your school anymore and now you're out of the corps you'll have more responsibility, I really hope to see you develop as a dancer while you are here.\" He leant back in his chair, regarding her closely, \"You understand that the position of junior soloist isn't a permanent one; so this is your chance to sink or swim as they say.\" \"Yes of course.\" \"Good.\" \"You see Daniel,\" said Dorian in a husky, languid baritone, \"This is what I need. Fresh talent, fresh young talent.\" Katrina found she could blush harder after all. \"You're right of course Dorian, but I found her first so hands off.\" Daniel laughed, throwing his head back, very white teeth flashing. \"You're free to go Miss Christiansen, Dorian and I have more business to discus.\" She smiled shyly at both men and left, feeling like a schoolgirl who's just seen Justin Beiber at the corner shop. The studio was stating to fill by the time Katrina had negotiated the locker rooms and changed into her dance clothes, she didn't know what kind of dress code they had in Pittsburgh so she'd kept it smart in a dark blue leotard, light tights and a pink wraparound cardigan. At the Jeoffrey she and the other girls had regularly worn shorts and crop-tops to dance in but she wasn't quite ready to be wearing her Michal Jackson tribute t-shirt to class just yet. The other dancers all looked as she entered the studio but none of them approached her and she saw a lot of whispering going on behind hands. Typical she thought and tried to keep her chin high, not to be intimidated. At the barre she found herself in front of a blonde ballerina wearing an electric blue shrug, turning around, she introduced herself. \"Hey, I'm Katrina, the new girl.\" She stuck out her hand. \"I'm Lauren Meyers. Soloist.\" The other girl smiled thinly, not taking Katrina's hand, thankfully the sudden slamming of the studio door. In walked an older woman with ash-white hair and shocking blood-red lipstick, which put Katrina in mind of a geriatric Snow White. It was the same lady who had been present in the auditions along with the director, Katrina recognized her but did not remember her name. A hush fell across the whole room as the lady all but floated to the front and turned to face the dancers. Clapping her hands for attention, she spoke in ringing tones. \"Okay class, plies, first variation. Ready Jack?\" she turned to the pianist who hurriedly started to play. Katrina copied the dancer in front, trying to fit the familiar motions to a new routine. Forward, out, up, down, point your feet, turn them out! She thought to herself. They continued variation after variation, the lady walking up and down the aisles of dancers correcting and encouraging. As she approached them, Katrina tightened her grip on the barre out of nerves. \"Relax dear,\" said the lady, pushing Katrina's shoulders slightly further back, \"Its only your first day.\" Katrina smiled nervously at her and she passed on to correct the man in front's posture. Three hours later and they broke for lunch, not knowing anyone Katrina consigned herself to a lonely sandwich until a small dancer with shocking red hair jogged up to catch her before she slipped out of the locker room. \"Hey\" she said, beaming brightly, \"I'm Sonja, you're the new soloist, Katrina, right?\" the red-headed girl extended a freckled hand. \"Yeah,\" Katrina replied, shaking it. \"Cool, wow, you must be so excited about your first day, right?\" \"More like nervous really, it's a pretty intense class.\" Both girls started walking out towards the reception. \" Madame B is pretty strict, keeps us on our toes. No pun intended.\" Sonja giggled. \"Anyway, come have lunch with us, get to know everyone?\" \"Us?\" Katrina questioned. \"Yes, look-\" Sonja pointed to three dancers standing in the street the other side of the glass studio doors, waving and motioning for them to hurry up. \"I'd love to.\" Katrina smiled, relieved to have found someone so friendly. \"Cool, now come and meet everyone.\" Sonja swished her bright red hair and all but skipped out into the street, flinging the door open and earning herself a glare from the tight-lipped receptionist. Katrina laughed and followed maybe Pittsburgh wasn't so uptight after all. On the way to what Katrina was assured was the cheapest café all of Pittsburgh the other dancers made their introductions. Mark, a tall, African man with a wicked sense of humor and flashing, dark eyes was the lead male soloist. Danni, the youngest of the group was in the corps having just graduated from Princeton Ballet School, she had a soft lilting voice, a slight lisp, and long blonde hair held back with an Alice-band. Danni knew Sonja from school and they were old friends. Vlad, a Russian soloist, son of defected parents was an inordinately cheerful skinhead who bounded along talking at a million miles an hour. He and Sonja were dating, to the stern disapproval of both sets of parents. Unusually for a ballet dancer, Vlad had several tattoos, one of the Moscow skyline and the Kremlin, which he lifted his shirt up to show everybody. \"I just got it finished a few weeks ago\" he said, explaining, \"Look, here's where my parents used to live\" her pointed to an outline map of Russia on his ribs, \"and here's Putin!\" he pointed again to a little caricature devil in a suit on his left side. Laughing, Sonja kissed him on the cheek \"Put your abs away babe it's a girlfriend's privilege to see that sort of thing you know.\" They were about to kiss again when Mark forcibly dragged Vlad away by the ear. Katrina looked at him alarmed. \"Don't worry,\" said Danni \"If they start kissing it'll be the end of break before we get to the café.\" She took a slightly put out looking Sonja by the arm and frog marched her the rest of the way. The café, when they finally arrived, was dark, smoky and cramped with builders having midday cups of coffee and burgers. They trooped in and took a seat at the back. \"What's good to eat around here?\" asked Katrina, eyeing a burger with longing. \"They do a good line in salad actually,\" said Danni, helpfully pointing to the back of the menu, \"Chicken Cesar is the best one in my opinion anyway.\" \"Oh no, you gotta have the BLT\" encouraged Mark from across the table. \"Mmmh, I dunno, this little lady needs to watch her figure.\" \"No, way\" Sonja elbowed her, \"you're really slim.\" Katrina blushed yet again and stammeringly asked Sonja what she was having. \"Plain salad… this little lady needs to watch her figure too.\" Sonja pouted. \"I'll watch it for you.\" Said Vlad from the seat opposite, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively. Apparently the couple were banned from sitting next to each other in public because of what Danni termed their \"wildly inappropriate behavior\". The quartet laughed and joked all through their lunch hour, Katrina joined in with the conversation and filled them in on life in Chicago and her friends there. All too soon it was time to go back to class. Katrina sighed, laying down some money for her salad. \"What's up?\" Asked Danni. \"Nothing, not really looking forward to hours more of the \"dragon lady\" in class this afternoon.\" Katrina's toes still hurt form the morning's exertions. \"Don't worry\" Piped up Sonja, wiping on some lip-gloss and checking her reflection in her compact. \"It's all good practice, and we'll need it too, I heard that auditions might be as soon as next week.\" \"Next week?\" the others chorused back, horrified. \"Yeah, I overheard smoky-Josie Lawrence talking to Dan Kline about the scheduling of auditions. Apparently it's a nightmare. \" She smiled wickedly, imitating the receptionist's clipped tones. \"No way Sonja.\" Said Danni, looking a little shell-shocked, \"we don't even know what we're doing for this season yet!\" \"Well, I'm sure we'll soon find out.\" On that gloomy note the dancers filed mutely out of the café and into the icy streets outside, Sonja and Vlad hand in hand once more. A/N Thanks for reading! xxx[Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I do not own Warrior (surprise!) Chapter 5 January 19 th Tommy's alarm went off at six in the morning and he jerked awake out of a dream full of gunshots and desert sand. Smacking the alarm off, he waited in the pitch-darkness for his heart rate to return to normal before rolling to his feet and heading for the shower. It was too early yet for anyone else to be up and he tried his best to be quiet. Tess had returned from her sister's house last night and the family, Tommy included, had gone out for pizza, much to the girl's delight. He was finding, to his surprise that he actually got on well with Tess. He admired her stoic no-nonsense attitude, which had allowed her to accept that he would be sleeping on their couch for the foreseeable future without question or fuss. Tess reminded Tommy painfully of his own mother, the two women had the same warmth and devotion to their children but despite the pain of reminiscence, he liked being around her. Plus, he thought, she made Brendan incredibly happy and anyone who did that was good enough for him. In the last few days Tommy had begun to relax into his temporary home, he'd stopped waking Brendan up in the middle of the night, wracked with nightmares and his craving for the pain meds he'd thrown away had started to ebb somewhat. Getting out of the shower Tommy quickly surveyed himself in the mirror taking in the shoulder, still slightly discolored and swollen from the re-setting, which had hurt like a bitch. He was still relatively skinny, nothing like his fighting weight at Sparta but the dark circles had been wiped from under his eyes and the color come back into his face. No oil painting he thought ruefully, slipping on a shirt, but less like a crack addict at least. He was borrowing Brendan's car, after Sparta, the family had been able to afford a second one for Tess. Brendan had given him the keys the night before and threatened to take his balls off if he so much as scratched \"old faithful.\" It was typical; Brendan had been just the same with his first car back in high school when he made Tommy walk three miles home for putting his feet up on the dashboard. Arriving at the Frank's Gym just before eight, Tommy noticed that it was open and several men were already doing sets in the weights area as he made his way towards Frank's office. He knocked and stuck his head around the door. \"Tommy! Come in.\" Frank stage whispered, as he was on the phone. Tommy loitered awkwardly, hands in the pockets of his jeans. He waited for Frank to finish his conversation and stared at the many pictures of famous fighters on the walls. \"You've got quite a collection going here\" he said when Frank put down the phone. \"Thanks\" Frank replied, \"I should probably get a picture of you and Brendan up there one of these days.\" \"Yeah, well one of Bren definitely.\" Tommy said quietly, Frank nodded and motioned for Tommy to sit. \"Okay, here's what I need you to do for today,\" he pushed a stack of papers across the desk. Tommy looked nonplussed. \"They're application forms for fighters to enter different competitions, see?\" he pointed to the headers, \"MMA Carolina, the Red bull Tournament in LA, yeah?\" \"Okay so, what do I do with them?\" asked Tommy. \"Right, so each tournament has a website and the entry form that the fighter fills in has to be re-posted online and then we need to get the dates of their fights, and it all goes in the spreadsheets.\" \"Right…\" said Tommy, not sure how to feel about his first taste of office work, \"So where do I do all this?\" \"Here, you're manning the desk for a couple hours while I go and talk to some potential sponsors. That okay?\" \"Yeah,\" Tommy nodded, \"I think I can handle that, do people come in here to sign up to the gym?\" he asked remembering Colt Boyd's setup. \"Yeah, the sheets are here-\" he indicated a draw on the left, \"and insurance waivers are there as well.\" \"Okay. Good.\" Said Tommy seemingly for the hundredth time. The two men swapped places and he noticed for the first time that Frank was wearing a suit. He smirked, Frank looked about as comfortable in a suit as he would in a dress. \"So, you're going all out for those sponsors huh?\" \"A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.\" And with that Frank strode of the office leaving Tommy alone with a mountain of paperwork. The fist thing Tommy noticed about working in the office was how unbelievably distracting the sound of the gym was when he was immersed in the fiddly task of entering the fighters for their upcoming competitions. After deleting one profile completely and having to start from scratch and then nearly entering a 200- pound fighter into a bantamweight regional bout he gave up and decided he needed a break. Heading out of the office and rolling his shoulder a few times experimentally he nearly went headfirst into a large black man walking in the opposite direction. \"Whoa there.\" The man said pulling up sharply. \"Sorry man.\" Replied Tommy, embarrassed. \"It's alright- say,\" the man's Harlem drawl stretched the words out to improbable proportions, \"You're that Tommy Riordan guy aint'cha?\" \"Uh yeah, why?\" The man raised his eyebrows at Tommy's defensiveness but then smiled again, very white teeth glinting against his dark skin, Tommy noticed that he had no fewer than three gold caps. \"Jay Dwayne\" he said, sticking out a hand the size of a dinner plate \"Nice to meet'cha man. You trainin' here too?\" \"Not yet\" replied Tommy, shaking his hand \"I'm working in the office.\" \"The office? Man you should be out there in the cage, I saw you in Sparta, was pretty dope.\" Tommy felt his ears go red. He'd heard that he'd gained some fans from his involvement in Sparta but as he was sent straight back into the Marines he'd never really met any. \"Uhh, thanks man, its just 'till my shoulder heals up then I'm gonna get back in shape.\" \"Oh, cool man well, I'd better hit the weights, Frank's got me here all hours of the day. Where is he by the way?\" \"Talkin' to sponsors.\" \"Ah, right well, catch up w'cha later then.\" \"Yeah man, see ya.\" And with a wave Jay was striding off towards a group of equally massive men by the weights all of which turned to gawp at Tommy, Jay had obviously told them who he was. Feeling supremely uncomfortable under the scrutiny, Tommy returned to the office. Filling in the last sign-up form on the computer and shutting the dammed thing down, Tommy lent back in his chair and stretched, feeling his back click in a satisfying manner. Frank was due back at any moment and Tommy was desperate to get off desk duty, sitting still was never his forte. He checked his watch, it was twelve thirty almost time for lunch. Just as he was wondering where he could pick up a sandwich, Frank came bursting into the office, shrugging off his coat he threw it over the back of a chair. \"Y'alright?\" asked Tommy as Frank threw himself down into the chair across the desk and rubbed his eyes. \"Yeah, yeah been in meetings all this morning. One of the fighters here has lost his sponsor.\" \"How'd he manage that?\" Tommy gathered up the completed forms, which he had spread across the desk and handed them to Frank. \"Oh you know-\" Frank flicked through the sign-up forms checking the dates, \"DUI, drug position… he was being sponsored by Gatorade so you're supposed to uphold some sort of clean living image...\" \"His loss I guess\" Said Tommy getting up and putting on his jacket. \"I'm off for lunch- half an hour?\" \"No take the hour off, I've got some more emails to send.\" \"Okay.\" With that Tommy strode out of the office and back into the main gym, hood up and hands in the pockets. However keeping his head down didn't stop him from being waylaid. \"Hey man, Riordan!\" he heard from somewhere to his left, getting a feeling this was aimed at him Tommy was torn between stopping and being polite or pretending he hadn't heard and making a break for it. In the end the manners his mother had instilled in him won out. \"Hey.\" he replied lowering his hood to take a look at who was calling him. It was Jay; towel over one shoulder, waving for him to come over. Jay's two friends were both obviously heavy weight fighters, looking more like basketball players on steroids. They towered over Tommy and were obviously excited to meet him, the man who'd ripped the door off a tank. The men introduced them selves as Joe and Chad both fighters of Frank's. Tommy shook their hands and asked them what fights they were looking to be competing at in the near future. The conversations took them all the way out of the gym and before he knew it Tommy was settled into a booth at a greasy spoon café across the road. It reminded Tommy of the place where he had met with his father to ask him to train him for Sparta all those months ago. He felt a pang of guilt at not having visited him. They had spoken a few times on the phone during Tommy's time at Camp George but not nearly to the extent to which he had spoken to Brendan. Secretly Tommy wondered it his father's relapse hadn't something to do with it, if the tables hadn't turned and now his old man was avoiding him . \"Man!\" someone clicked their fingers in front of his face and Tommy jerked back to reality. \"What?\" everyone was looking at him. \"What you gonna have darlin'?\" a pretty blonde waitress was looking at him expectantly. \"Uhh,\" Tommy stalled, looking at Jay who threw his hands up. \"Don't look at me man I already ordered.\" \"Right, err- I'll have a quarter pounder thanks\" The three heavy weights looked jealous, Tommy felt the back of his neck and his ears heat up in embarrassment, \"I'm trying to get back to middle weight.\" \"Don't tell me you lost condition in the Marines, what were you doing for Sparta?\" asked Chad. \"My old man was training me, he knows how it's done, I reckon I lost about twenty pounds in the Marines but that's my fault.\" Chad and the others looked flabbergasted, \"Twenty pounds? You ever think about going down the weight class permanently?\" \"Yeah, thought about it but Sparta is a middle weight competition-\" \"We know.\" Chorused the heavy weights, obviously not pleased to be out of the running for such a high profile competition with such a large purse. The waitress returned with three plates of chicken salad and a hamburger, she made eyes at Joe (who only had eyes for Tommy's hamburger) and left in a huff. \"Man she was totally giving you the look! \" stage whispered Jay to his friend who almost choked on a piece of chicken. \"I, um, I'm sure she was just doin' her job\" stuttered Jay his Hispanic olive skin flushing. \"Yeah, I'm sure she was just doing her job ,\" mocked Chad. \"Joe's useless with chicks\" he explained to Tommy as though he scene needed further clarification. \"Me'n Jay have been tryin' to set him up for ages now but… no luck.\" \"Really? Thought you'd be a hit with the groupies.\" smiled Tommy. \"He is, just too shy to see it.\" Said Jay. Joe muttered something mutinous into his salad, flushing deeper. The others grinned. Just then someone entered the café and the thick smoke inside cleared momentarily as a stiff breeze rushed in. Tommy, having sat in the aisle seat facing the door was the first to see the girls walk in but the expression on his face was enough to have the others craning their necks to take a look. Three girls entered the café, looking as out of place as butterflies in a swamp. They maneuvered themselves to the bar and sat chattering softly. \"The other advantage of this place,\" pointed out Jay, speaking quietly so they wouldn't be overheard, \"some of the chicks from Pittsburgh ballet hang out here in their lunch break.\" \"Ballet dancers? I didn't know the 'Burg even had a ballet ,\" Tommy stole another appreciative look at the girls at the bar. \"I talked to 'em once\" mumbled Joe from across the table. \"Just about the only time he's ever talked to a woman.\" Laughed Chad. \"Shut up man! It was the blonde one there.\" Joe looked longingly at the tiny white-blond woman with hair that tumbled down her back. She was whispering something to one of her friends; a girl with dark brunette hair and deep pink lips that Tommy would dream about that night. \"She is pretty hot.\" Said Jay simply, returning to his salad with renewed vigor, \"They come in a few times a week, puts this place head and shoulders above any other joint in town.\" The others agreed and returned to their lunch, to conversation moved to training and Frank's use of Mozart, which all the fighters agreed was proving weirdly effective. \"It sorted Midnight Lee out,\" said Joe conversationally, \"Remember when he first came here?\" \"Yeah,\" agreed Chad \"he was all over the place, I think getting beat by your bro sort of took it out of his confidence y'know?\" Tommy felt a rush of pride for Brendan, the toughest brother on the planet. \"I thought Midnight trained in Chicago?\" questioned Tommy, taking another bite of burger- he sure was glad to be off military rations. \"He was,\" explained Chad \"But after Sparta he ditched his trainer and came straight to Frank- tryin' to get a piece of the Campana magic.\" \"And he's improving again?\" asked Tommy. \"Scoping out the competition already?\" grinned Jay. \"You have to know who you're getting into the cage with, right?\" \"Well, as long as you're not planning on fighting your brother again I don't think you have to worry.\" Jay chuckled, the deep bass vibrating the whole table. \"Say-\" asked Jay tipping the waitress as they made to leave, \"Your brother ever getting back in the ring?\" Tommy shrugged slipping on his jacket in preparation for the cold Pittsburgh air. \"I don't think so, not after Sparta.\" He didn't add that Tess would probably never forgive him if he did. \"So you really are in the running then for the five million?\" \"I guess, have to see how my shoulder heals up and if I can get back in shape in time.\" The other men nodded together like bobbing dogs on a dashboard. As Tommy and the others headed back across the road towards the gym, they all chanced a last look at the dancers at the bar caught each other looking and laughed. Maybe , Tommy thought, things might be looking up . The girl with pink lips caught his eye as he looked back at the café for one last time. Things were definitely looking up. A/N Thanks for reading (I will totally respond to any reviews so if you have any comments/critique please don't hold back) xxx[Chapter 6] Disclaimer: I own nothing Chapter 6 January 30 th Fudge! Crud! Crap! Katrina tried to think of every not-too-rude word she could as she felt her last pair of pointe shoes give way under her toes. Shit. That did it. They were practicing turns in the soloist's studio and by now everyone was drenched with sweat and several pairs of dead pointe shoes languished in the trash. \"Again!\" cried Madame B; over the past few days Katrina had learned a few things about the temperamental ballet mistress. Firstly that her full name was Bertoli, she was from New York and ha several cats. More importantly, Katrina had learned to keep well out of her way during a class. The woman's mood swings were the stuff of legend and Sonja had recounted to her a number of particular dramatic episodes where someone had either been hit over the head with a slipper or Madam B had stormed out of the class. In first class after hearing Sonja's lurid tales, Katrina had practically hugged the wall for the first half an hour. \"Mam?\" Katrina raised a slightly shaky hand and Madame B rounded on her. \"Yes?\" \"My pointes have just died on me can I-\" but Madame B interrupted her. \"Go! Go! You may as well get out if you don't have another pair, we finish in ten minutes anyway. Go on.\" Madame B started flapping and shooing her out of the studio. Without waiting to be told twice Katrina nodded mutely and scurried out. She only removed the offending shoes when she was safely in the concrete corridor outside. She sat on the floor, brushing a few damp strands of hair out of her eyes working out the knot of the ribbons at her ankle. Just as she got the fist shoe off and was flexing her sore toes she heard the sound of approaching footsteps. Footsteps with a heavy tread and the tap of hard soled shoes. She looked up and saw Daniel Kline approaching her, a wide smile on his tanned and handsome face. \"Hello little Katrina\" he called jovially. They hadn't spoken a word since her first day and she felt heat rising into her cheeks and she tried to gracefully scrabble up the wall. He chuckled softly and her efforts and took her hand to help her up. His hand was very warm and dry; she felt the power in his grip as he pulled her to his feet. \"Thanks\" she said looking at the ground; her hand tingled as he let it go. \"You're welcome,\" he frowned, \"Aren't you meant to be in class?\" gesturing to the door which she had recently come through. \"Yeah- my last pair of pointes died so I got sent out .\" Being in this company is just like being in school; I feel like I should have a hall pass! Katrina thought. \"Oh, that's a shame\" Daniel said, \"Do you have more pointes at home, I realize that we haven't given you an allowance to get any. I'm sorry, I should have organized that, it's been busy around here.\" He grinned sheepishly and looked so boyish that her knees all but melted. \"That's alright Mr. Klien-\" \"Daniel, please, we are friends yes?\" \"uhh, yes. Daniel…\" Actually you're my boss she thought \"Anyway don't worry about it, I have a pair in my locker… an allowance would be great though.\" \"I'll organize that tonight got to have you in good shape for the season so no dancing on ruined shoes you hear me?\" he tried to sound stern but smiled again and she really did melt that time. \"Of course…\" Just at that moment every soloist in the company poured out of the doors just next to them and filed past sneaking covert looks, some, like Lauren Meyers, openly glaring at her. Suddenly her position, backed against a wall with Daniel Kline, the director of the whole company almost chest to chest with her, seemed highly inappropriate. She felt her cheeks blanche with acute embarrassment, and looked at her feet, one in a pointe shoe and one bare. \"I'd better go.\" She said quietly wishing he were standing a little further away now that everybody could see. \"Of course, you should go for lunch I, uhh need to speak with Madam Bertoli right away.\" Daniel quickly turned and entered the studio, shutting the door behind him. As she was busily undoing her second pointe shoe she felt a hand on her shoulder and looked up sharply but it was Mark, coat and scarf on, obviously ready to go for break. He was making himself busy, wrapping up her shoes and putting them into her bag. \"Thanks\" she said touched by his helpfulness. \"Its quite alright doll\" he said, his deep voice soothing her slightly frazzled nerves \"That was quite a show you were putting on there \" he grinned up at her to show he was joking. \"Its not what it looks like.\" she countered, \"He was just offering to get me a pointe shoe allowance.\" \"Sugar daddy!\" teased Mark handing her the bag as she glared at him \"Now, are you coming to lunch or are you gonna sulk? All alone- with no one but Lauren Meyers for company?\" Lauren Meyers had fast become a running joke within the group; from her fist sight of Katrina she had disliked her cordially and never missed a chance to make her feelings known. Lauren, as Katrina had learned too late, was the new principal at Pittsburgh Ballet replacing the well-liked Joanne Billings who was on an indefinite maternity leave but kept sending in postcards and photographs of her growing bump which the other dancers shared around and cooed over. Lauren on the other hand was the very epitome of the wonderful word \"standoffish\" , borderline rude with every word that came out of her mouth. Thankfully no one else liked her much either with the notable exceptions of Dorian Toulouse and Daniel Kline, both of whom had been spotted checking her out as she passed in the corridors. \"Do you think Lauren was jealous ?\" asked Katrina. \"Jealous? Darl, why should she be jealous of something she's already had? \" \"Seriously? You think she and-?\" \"You are so naive sometimes Katy, breaks my heart.\" Mark rolled his dark cat-like eyes at her \"How else do you think she made principal?\" \"I dunno she's a good dancer?\" \"Sure sure.\" By that awkward point in the conversation they had reached the greasy spoon café where Sonja, Danni and Vlad were waiting. Sonja and Vlad were sitting with Danni in between because they were \"on the rocks\" as Sonja had confided that morning in the dressing room. Vlad had forgotten their six-month anniversary. Katrina ordered a Cesar salad and settled next to Danni whilst Mark joined Vlad on the men's side of the table. It had turned out, that first day, that Sonja had been wrong about auditions. They'd been called into the main rehearsal space after their abbreviated lunch hour so that Daniel could welcome them back for \"What he hoped would be a very exciting and successful season with the Pittsburgh Ballet.\" He'd also introduced Lauren as Joanne's replacement as their new head soloist. A move, which Sonja had whispered, was tantamount to promising her the lead role this season and had caused many hushed whisperings amongst the crowd. Since then the company had been conditioning and training hard every day, stretching and strengthening muscles which had grown comparatively soft after their Christmas holidays but still there was no mention of their next show. The company was starting to get antsy; Katrina noticed how everyone's eyes scanned the noticeboard at the entrance everyday looking for a hint as to what was planned for the months ahead. Finally, after what had seemed a truly interminable wait, Katrina arrived early one morning and had spotted a sign on the notice board announcing that the forthcoming production would be announced that afternoon after lunch. \"You know,\" Katrina said to Sonja who was moodily toying with her sandwich \"I was so exciting about this afternoon. I woke up this morning and rushed straight out of the house without any breakfast or even a coat!\" she giggled. Sonja and Vlad's stony silences to each other were making her a little nervy. Mark smiled encouragingly as Sonja cracked her first smile of the day. \"I know right?\" Sonja agreed. \"Especially since that Toulouse guy was here, he's such a famous choreographer and I know he was just meant to be visiting Daniel and sight-seeing but I bet he's come up with some of the choreography for the show. They spent an awful lot of time in that office.\" Dorian Toulouse's visit to Pittsburgh had piqued everyone's interest. The choreographer's work was often featured on the stages of Paris, London, and New York and his exploits in the pages of Dance weekly. As troublesome as he was brilliant, Toulouse was often pictured falling out of clubs and hotels with dancers and models on his arms. His stay in Pittsburgh had kept all the female dancers, and some of the men on their toes. Full make-up and even false eyelashes and nails had been worn with gusto but unfortunately the object of all their affections had remained cloistered in the office with Daniel Kline almost all week, causing much frustration. \"I agree with you there Sonja, but do you think we will be doing an original piece of his or an adaptation of a classic?\" asked Danni. She had her nails painted in stripes of blue white and red in the style of the French flag in Toulouse's honor, much to everyone's amusement. \"I dunno… I think a classic, you sell more tickets that way.\" Vlad made a noise of agreement from across the table and Sonja glared at him. They paid and left soon after that, all eager to get back to the studios and find out the news. As they walked, Vlad throwing Sonja sidelong looks every five seconds, Sonja took Katrina's sleeve and drew her to the back of the group so they could talk in private. \"What is it?\" Katrina asked, looking down at her redheaded friend, with raised eyebrows. \"Okay, I have a proposition for you.\" \"A proposition?\" Sonja had a twinkle in her eye which Katrina had a feeling would lead to nothing but trouble. \"Yes, so- you know this job doesn't exactly pay much right?\" \"Yeah?\" Katrina was accustomed to the genteel poverty of a dancer's meager wages. \"Well, how would you like to earn a little extra money?\" Katrina gave her a swift look. \" From Dancing! I'm not offering you a job in a strip club or anything!\" \"That's a relief.\" They both laughed, their breath making clouds of steam in the cold January air. \"No. No stripping. It's a sort of dance team , we do half-time shows at local sporting events… football, basketball, that's the big one actually and even some boxing matches. Just to keep the crowd entertained.\" \"I'm guessing its not much ballet then?\" Sonja snorted in a very unladylike fashion, \"Not much, more shaking yo' booty and some acrobatics even some cool air stunts, lifts and throws. I think you'd be good.\" \"Thanks,\" Katrina smiled \"it sounds like fun, lots of fun. But when do you guys find the time to rehearse?\" \"Of course it sounds like fun! We rehearse on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, the routines aren't hard or anything so we do just one or two hours at a time.\" \"Okay… and what about when we have the show to do? We're going to have some pretty crazy hours to keep.\" \"Its not a problem, the whole group is from the PB so we can be flexible. Some days we practice before coming to work.\" \"Wow, dedication.\" Sonja shrugged her tiny shoulders \"It's a good earner, there's only eight of us at the moment but we're a popular group and its nice to have some money that doesn't go on rent or insurance or the gas bill y'know?\" \"Yeah, I totally know what you mean. So do I have to audition?\" \"Nah… just come along on Wednesday and we'll work you into the routine. I already recommended you.\" \"Oh my gosh, thank you! This sounds so great.\" Katrina clapped her hands in excitement. \"Just you wait till you see our uniforms.\" chuckled Sonja. \"Oh my god what are they? Katrina came to a halt. I'm not dancing in my panties, my mom watches the TV y'know and she'd never forgive me.\" \"Oh no\" said Sonja reassuringly, taking Katrina by the arm and leading her back to the rest of the group as they rounded the corner back to the studios. \"Its not underwear, but- crop tops, booty shorts… the girl who came up with the group, Lacy, you know her right?\" An image of a tall girl with lots of dark curly hair and a flirty personality came to Katrina's mind. \"Yeah?\" \"Well she's in charge and she's from Georgia, loves that whole cheerleader thing so expect sparkles. And spandex.\" \"Sparkles, spandex… okay… I can deal with that.\" Katrina smiled at Sonja as they passed back through the stage doors into the main hall, shedding their coats and stood waiting for the big announcement. A/N thanks for reading! please leave a review! x[Chapter 7] Disclaimer: I own nothing Chapter 7 January 30 th Tommy and Brendan were in the doctor's waiting room, Brendan pretending to read a magazine but really he was watching Tommy from the corner of his eye. He was amazed at the change in his brother over the course of their six-month separation. The man he had battled with at Sparta, the man with whom he had traded bitter words on the beach was gone. All the anger and spite that Tommy had kept bottled up against Brendan and their father, had seemingly drained out of him. The rage, which had been barely under control in the young marine, the rage which had fueled his fighting was gone. Instead, Tommy seemed oddly directionless to Brendan, tired, almost passive; agreeing to stay with Brendan, accepting his financial help and even agreeing to visit a doctor, something they both knew Brendan would have to pay for. Brendan had also realized just how shy Tommy was around new people, he recognized that Tommy's \"tough guy\" reputation preceded him and that Tommy hid behind it totally, allowing people to come to whatever assumptions about him they would, never reveling anything of his personality. Brendan smiled wryly to himself, this general reticence was nothing new with Tommy, even when the boys had been young Brendan had been the outgoing one, the football captain, prom-king type whereas Tommy had been quite the opposite. Quiet, intense and brilliant at sport, Tommy had had few friends at school, especially after he started competitive wrestling whereupon his obsessive training had claimed every scrap of his time and of course Paddy's attention. But, it was too late to be having thoughts like that Brendan remonstrated himself; when he thought of Tommy's last few years he knew how little there was to be jealous of in his younger brother's life. Brendan felt a surge of protectiveness towards Tommy just as he had at the final of Sparta when he had half-carried his sobbing brother out of the cage and into an ambulance. At that moment he'd wanted to shelter Tommy from a world that had been so hard to him from such a young age, wanted to atone for the years of abandonment because, no matter what he said to Tommy about only being a kid when he'd left Tommy and their mother to escape Pittsburgh without him, he still felt the shame of his betrayal. Now in the sterile, featureless waiting room, this shame stabbed at him afresh. It was his fault that Tommy was here. His fault that he may never fight again as he so desperately wanted to do. The memory of the sick cracking sound as Tommy's shoulder dislocated and his brother's cry of agony echoed inside his skull and Brendan shut the magazine with a snap. Leaning back in his seat with a sigh, he rubbed his eyes. \"Hey Bren?\" Tommy looked up, \"You alright?\" \"Yeah. I'm fine… not the one seeing the doctor am I.\" Tommy cracked a grin, \"That's true.\" Then, seeing the look of pity flashing across Brendan's face Tommy understood. \"You're not feeling guilty are ya? Not after six months?\" Brendan sighed again \"Yes I still feel fucking guilty. How could I not? You were in the hospital Tommy! And that was my fault!\" Tommy sighed too, looking hard at Brendan. \"Look. Bren, I won't say I wasn't angry. Okay? The first few days when I was out of hospital I must have cussed you out a thousand times. But now? Its okay. You did what you had to do, for your family. I can respect that, would have done the same.\" \"But you didn't though…\" \"Nah, never got the chance, you're a slippery bastard in the cage.\" Tommy shrugged nonchalantly with one shoulder, picking up the magazine that Brendan had abandoned. The news was good. Tommy came out of the doctor's office with a script for sleeping pills, which he would never take, and one for painkillers, which he would have thrown away if not for Brendan's intervention. The doctor warned him that getting back the full range of mobility not to mention the strength in his shoulder was going to take some time. He would have recommended physical therapy but, he recognized that if the shoulder could stand up to six months of drills in the marines then physio was unlikely to do much good at this stage. The doctor simply told Tommy to go easy on the weights and to do at least three weeks of some special resistance training exercises before the heavy punching and weight-lifting could begin in earnest. All in all , thought Tommy, not too bad . In fact, for once in Tommy Riordan's life he could say that almost everything was not too bad . His work for Frank, although dull at times would get him back to the training he craved, his shoulder was on the mend and so was his relationship with Brendan. Tess was helping that gap heal even better and seemed to be the glue that kept the Conlan family together. Jay and the other heavyweights had kept on inviting Tommy to lunch, seemingly determined to be friendly and he was starting to feel, much as he had in the military, that he was a part of a band of brothers, people he could trust and relate to. In fact, only thing that Tommy was seriously worried about was Pop. He still hadn't gone to see the old man, unwilling perhaps to burst the small bubble of peace in which he found himself. Brendan hadn't spoken to him either, so neither knew what to expect, except that this time neither brother would be going alone. Tommy privately wondered what they would find, the old man back on the drink as he had been in Atlantic City? Or perhaps Pop would be just as sober and groveling, as plaintive and pathetic as he head been the first night Tommy had seen him in Pittsburgh. Neither thought cheered Tommy much and as the brothers made the drive from the surgery to Frank's gym, Brendan noticed his subdued mood. \"What y'thinking about?\" he asked. \"Pops… not even sure I want to visit him. But we gotta.\" \"We don't have to, not if you're not ready.\" Brendan appreciated that although he had plenty of problems of his own to do with his father, Tommy's were fresher, sharpened by their mother's death. Tommy nodded wordlessly, settling deeper into his seat, his expression unreadable. Brendan dropped Tommy off at the gym and drove off to collect the girls from a friend's house. Inside a fight was in progress and most of the men had abandoned their weights and punching bags to have a watch. Midnight Lee, sweat dripping and fists flying was slugging it out against a heavily muscled man with tattoos on his face. The two were circling each other like tigers in a pen. The tattooed man kicked out at Midnight who was not quite quick enough to dodge it, he doubled over momentarily which gave the other man an opportunity to throw him to the floor. But, the burly fighter wasn't beaten yet. As quick as a flash Midnight was back on his feet, rallying, he applied his fists to the tattooed face with the swift efficiently which he traded on; Midnight was not a flexible fighter, his strength lay in his fists and feet. The other man staggered back and by the time Tommy had reached the side of the platform with the sound of Beethoven echoing from Frank's speakers, the tattooed man was out cold. \"Go on Midnight!\" yelled Frank, evidently elated that his new high-profile fighter was back in the game. \"Finish him!\" yelled the crowd, fists pumping into the air. Midnight obliged by kicked the tattooed man in the ribs. In an instant Frank was in the ring with the two men and breaking up the scuffle. \"Okay, okay! Back to work!\" he yelled, and the knots of bystanders dispersed slowly still pumped up by the display in the ring. Tommy passed by the ring, nodding a brief greeting to Jay and the heavyweights as they sloped off, back to their punching bags. He saw Frank exchanging words with Midnight whilst he un-taped the fighter's hands. Witnessing the fight had reminded Tommy about his own ambitions, he was itching to get back into the ring and, after the doctor's good diagnosis that morning he saw no reason not to get back in training; if Frank would have him that was. Tommy's time at Camp George had cost him near a stone in weight, a far cry from the condition he had been in for Sparta. All the work he'd done had been erased in only a few short months leaving him at square one. Tommy sat down in the office with a sigh, waiting for Frank to come in and tell him what needed doing. He stood up again moments later, rolling his shoulders and cracking his neck, never able to stay still for too long. At that moment Frank burst into the office, grinning broadly, \"He's good isn't he?\" he said, evidently speaking about Midnight who was warming down outside. \"Yeah, real good.\" Said Tommy scratching the back of his neck. \"So, you working all day today?\" asked Frank, shuffling through some papers and pulling out yet more fighter's entry forms. Tommy glared at the offending slips of paper before nodding. \"I went to the doctor's today, with Bren… \" Frank's had jerked up as though pulled by a string. \"Yeah?\" \"Well, Doc says that my shoulder should be almost back to normal in a few weeks, got some strong painkillers for it-\" \"So you want to get back in the ring?\" Frank gave him a level look as Tommy nodded. Then he sat down with a tired sigh. \"Look. Seven months ago you were potentially the best middleweight fighter in the country, if not the world. But now ? I don't' know. You've been out of the game for six months, lost a lot of condition and you've had this injury... It's going to take a while to get you back to the shape you were in for Sparta, maybe about a year.\" \"I know I'm ready for that.\" Tommy deadpanned. \"Yeah, I think you are too…\" Frank smiled slightly then stood up and came around the desk next to Tommy. \"If you're going to train here Tommy, I'll be your trainer but that means Beethoven, and a lot of work on your technique, I saw you fighting out there in Sparta it was all instinct and I think we can work with that. Deal?\" \"Deal.\" Said Tommy, shaking Frank's hand. A/N Oooh, two chapters in a day! I just thought these guys were a bit short to go up on their own, so enjoy! xx[Chapter 8] Disclaimer: I own nothing (life's just not fair!) Chapter 8 January 30 th Katrina and the other dancers assembled in the main studio, cheeks and ears pink from the cold outside. Daniel Kline walked amongst them, stopping here and there to talk to a dancer and welcome them back from the holidays. When he reached the front he turned to face the group, arms spread wide like the messiah. \"Company!\" he said in a ringing voice. \"I hope you had a wonderful Christmas, and rested well. You will need it. This season we are going to do something a little different, a little avant-garde. So, a fusion piece, a post-modern ballet for this industrial city but with a traditional story. Snow White, done to death I know but, not like this. We strip it down, make it visceral, real.\" A frisson of excitement passed around the room, everyone whispering to each other the sound rising like a swarm of bees. Daniel Klein's voice rose higher above the buzz. \"We use mostly the Angelin Preljocaj choreography, with a few of my own adjustments,\" more whispering ensued, louder this time. \"Company!\" Daniel Kline's voice rose above them again forcing silence. \"I know it's unorthodox, different, but I think that is exactly what this city needs from us, so we take a risk . Soloists if you could accompany Madam B to the first studio we can begin work on audition pieces. The rest of you, to class!\" He clapped his hands together and everybody bustled off, stripping off jumpers and coats, getting ready. Katrina and Sonja made their way hurriedly to the soloist's dressing room to prepare. \"Exciting isn't it?\" wondered Sonja aloud \"I love Preljocaj's work, no pointe shoes, its so fluid and so romantic.\" \"I've never seen it but I heard its way hard . \" added Katrina, slipping on her leotard with a wriggle, \"there's so much acting in it, I always hated that, I always get shy on stage if I'm in a character role.\" \"I'm sure you'll do just fine\" Sonja reassured her with a smile, \"maybe you'll be a sexy nymph in the forest, that'd be fun.\" \"Sexy nymph? I don't remember that part,\" asked Katrina non-plussed. \"Haven't you seen Snow White?\" Sonja asked, slipping on her \"lucky tights\", when Katrina shook her head she continued, \"you should, it's super sexy, there's even like lesbian action. \" She giggled. \"Lesbian action ? This is a ballet!\" \"A sexy ballet. God, I wish I could be Snow White, maybe Vlad could be my handsome prince?\" \"I thought you two were on the outs?\" \"Yeah, but he's still the one right? Sometimes I worry that we fight too much.\" \"You two definitely have the chemistry, what's romance without some sparks anyway. You'd be great together, but I wouldn't put it past you to get carried away on stage and offend the censors…\" They'd finished getting dressed by this point, except for pointe shoes, Karina fished her very last pair out of the back of her locker and sent a silent prayer up to heaven that they would last for the rest of the day. There was a tense silence in the soloist's studio when Katrina entered. All the dancers were ranged against one wall whilst Madame B walked them through the audition pieces. The music poured out of the piano like honey and Madam B was thoroughly enjoying herself. The dance she demonstrated looked monstrously difficult to Katrina; it was the part of the ballet where Snow White had fallen into an enchanted sleep and her prince was desperately trying to wake her. The female dancer was required to slip and slide in absolute passivity whilst at the same time being lifted and turned at lighting speed. \"Do we actually have to dace it with our eyes shut?\" Katrina asked Sonja in a whisper. \"I think so…\" she replied, eyes glued to the demonstration. The music ended and all the dancers applauded politely as Madame B took a deep curtsey and the male dancer who had been playing the part of the Prince, bowed. The rest of the session was spent paired up and practicing for the auditions, pairs were random so as to be as fair as possible and Katrina found herself partnered to Vlad. This would have been great had not she felt Sonja's laser-beam stare digging into her spine. She winced at the stretch in her back as Vlad lifted her one-handed and she flopped backward as though in an enchanted sleep. Next moment she was on the floor with a thud. \"Ouch!\" Katrina cried sitting up. \"Sorry sorry!\" Vlad was kneeling beside her in a flash, \"Are you hurt?\" he asked, checking her for cuts and scrapes. \"No no, I'm fine\" Katrina giggled as he lifted her to her feet and brushed her down like a small child. \"Try it again?\" \"Yeah. Again.\" They practiced, running the short routine again and again, Vlad bending her back until her head almost touched the ground and then pressing her close, every inch the heart broken prince. \"Careful,\" she warned him, after a particularly tight clinch, \"if you make Sonja any more jealous she might kill me in the locker-room.\" \"Well, I hope to make her jealous, maybe find my way back into her affections?\" \"Have you tried flowers and chocolates? Or any other plans which don't put my life so directly at risk?\" \"ermm… no.\" \"Well I suggest you start there- I bet Sonja is a sucker for a teddy bear.\" Vlad grinned, picking her up and twirling her around as they finished the routine yet again. \"I will take your advice to heart my lovely Snow White. A teddy bear it is.\" The day ended in a flurry of excitement, the dates of the auditions had been put up for exactly one week's time and everyone was trying to fit in extra practice time with their partners. Katrina jogged to catch up with Sonja as sped out of the changing room. \"Hey!\" she called, tapping Sonja on the shoulder, the tiny red-head whirled around to face her, close up Katrina could see that her friend was on the verge of tears. \"What?\" she asked. \"I was just wondering if you were okay? About me doing the duet with Vlad… I know you guys aren't speaking but-\" Katrina was well aware of the minefield of emotions that surrounded the \"on again/ off again\" relationship. \"Yeah…\" Sonja broke off and the two began to walk out towards the street. \"I guess I just really miss him. I know it sounds stupid but seeing you dance with him kinda hit a nerve.\" \"I'm sorry, but, I it's any conciliation, I know he's desperate to get you back- asked me for advice and everything.\" \"Really?\" Sonja's eyes shone with fresh tears. \"Hey hey hey-\" Katrina dug in her handbag for a tissue, \"no crying!\" \"I'm sorry!\" groaned Sonja, dabbing at her eyes, \"I'm not usually like this, must be audition stress.\" \"I know what you mean, but I think you'll be amazing. You've got a great partner and it'll be fine.\" \"Well look at you- miss motivator.\" laughed Sonja wetly, tears abated. \"To be honest I don't think it really matters how well any of us dance next week, Laruen only has to bat her eyelashes at Mr. Kline and she'll get the part.\" Katrina was surprised at the bitterness in her usually up-beat friend's tone. \"Has that been going on for a long time?\" she asked, intrigued. \"Oh yes,\" Sonja looked around as though afraid that Lauren might be hiding behind a trashcan waiting to pounce. \"For ages, even before Joanne left to have her baby. Daniel would single Lauren out, give her all the best roles… they even go out for lunch sometimes- I think he likes Lauren's ice-queen thing.\" She sighed. \"That must be so annoying for the rest of you,\" \"Oh yes, and it'll only get worse now that she's taken Joanne's place.\" The pair said their goodbyes as Katrina's bus pulled up at the stop, Sonja reminded her to stay after class on Wednesday so that they could practice for the team. Katrina promised to put it in her diary. As the bus pulled away Katrina spotted Sonja wiping her eyes again and hoped that Vlad would hurry up with that teddy bear. The bus pulled up at Katrina's stop and she jerked out of a doze, only just managing to scramble off before the doors snapped shut. She trudged up the many flights of stairs to her apartment and once inside flopped straight down onto the couch. The room was still full of the empty boxes that she hadn't found the time or inclination to take down to the recycling depot a few streets away. Curling into a little ball on the couch Katrina let her eyes drift shut. Just five minutes rest she thought. By the time she woke up night had fallen and the stars were just visible over the lights of Pittsburgh. She sat up, very stiff from being curled up for so long, and padded over to the kitchen for a glass of water. She checked her phone- three missed calls, two were from Casey and one from her mother. She sent Casey a quick text, filling her in on the events of the day, Snow White, the auditions and her moonlighting as a cheerleader. She knew Casey would get a kick out of that. The two girls had been utterly inseparable at the Joffrey School and later in the company, often spending their holidays together and even sharing a flat. Katrina missed Casey like she was missing a limb, the other girl's confident, strident attitude had been the perfect antidote to Katrina's occasional shyness; saving her from bullying at school and helping her make friends later on. Now Katrina had to strike out on her own. For her mother, Katrina left a voice mail, knowing that her mother never checked her texts. She tried to reassure her that she was eating enough, getting enough sleep, and otherwise being very healthy. Her mother lived in constant fear of Katrina falling ill whilst she was away from home and sent her constant reminders to wrap up warm against the cold Pittsburgh weather. She smiled, listening to one of her mother's more anxious voicemails, it felt nice to be fussed over, even if the parent dong the fussing was hundreds of miles away in Maine. She flipped through some of the pictures on her phone of her last visit home, her and her mother wrapped up against the cold having hot chocolate at a café in Rockland, the view on a clear day over the water to the mainland from her mother's tiny house on the island of North Haven. She sighed, flipping the phone shut, it had been too long since she had been at home. Katrina had left her mother's house on North Haven when she was eleven years old, taking the overland train across state lines to Chicago to attend the Joffrey School. She'd hardly been back since, staying at school for the holidays or living with Casey as the years went by but she still missed the quiet of the island. She missed the sound of the waves against the shore, the occasional buzz of the water planes landing, the smell of salt in the air and the swishing of long grasses against her legs as she ran down to the edge of the water to greet the ferry. She pulled herself back to the present, opening her eyes and trying to push the sounds of her childhood out of her head before she got too emotional. She refused to be homesick but all the same she listened to her mother's message again, just to hear her voice. Wednesday dawned cold and clear through Katrina's cheap net curtains. The first rim of pink was just visible over a horizon of trembling blue-green, like light shifting thorough the shallows of North Haven bay. Katrina rolled off her bed and headed straight for the shower- it was getting increasingly chilly in her apartment as another cold front moved inexorably across the eastern seaboard. Getting dressed and packing her bag for the day she paused, thinking about what she might need for her first practice with Sonja's \"dance team\", she tried on few different combinations- booty shorts, a little skirt. In the end she packed a pair of black Lycra shorts and a black tank top into her bag along with jazz shoes and her lucky sequined scrunchie that she's worn to her first Joffrey audition. It was a slow day, everyone was stressed about auditions, Madame B was shouting more than usual and Vlad kept on breaking off during their practices to go and talk to Sonja with whom he had finally made up. Apparently a very large teddy bear had been involved along with some jewelry. Katrina was pleased that he'd taken her advice and happy for her friends, but all the same- fifteen minutes of uninterrupted practice time would have been nice. Katrina's whole body ached from being picked up and tossed around over and over, they finally called it quits for the day when Vlad's arms all but gave out under her weight. He was sweating profusely, skin pale, and shining with the effort, his tattoos standing out like brands. \"I think it's time to go home don't you?\" she asked after being deposited unceremoniously on the floor. \"Definitely\" Vlad agreed, wiping his forehead and helping her up. \"I was planning on going home with Sonja but you all have that dance team thing tonight don't you.\" \"Christ!\" gasped Katrina, nearly flopping to the floor again, \"I'd forgotten about that- it's my first time.\" \"Well I hope you have fun, we've watched the girls in action a few times, they did the half-time show at a few football games last year, even got in the papers.\" \"Wow, that's cool, bet you boys are jealous .\" Katrina joked, stretching out her cramping legs. \"Oh yes, especially about those cute uniforms.\" \"Oh, Sonja warned me about those, can you tell me more?\" But Vlad just laughed archly and waved her goodbye, heading off towards the changing rooms. The studio was now empty except for Lauren who was doing a few stretches at the barre; a look of utter concentration on her face. Whatever the others thought, Katrina had a feeling that Lauren worked very hard to earn her position at the company, in fact she wondered if it wasn't the extra pressure that made the girl so rude and bitchy, people always say it's lonely at the top. Katrina left her to it and hurried off to shower. When Katrina looked up from lacing her jazz shoes she saw Sonja and Danni standing in front of her waiting. \"Coming?\" Danni asked, tapping a foot impatiently. \"Yeah\" she replied and straightened up to follow them. When the trio entered the main studio Katrina saw that seven other dancers, all girls she recognized, stood about. Everyone was casually dressed, gone were the leotards and in there place were band t-shirts and booty shorts. Katrina breathed a sigh of relief that she wasn't going to stick out from the crowd. Sonja introduced her to Lacy, the tall dark girl who had thought of the team and was acting as their \"Head Cheerleader\". Lacy's southern accent was thick enough to cut with a butter knife as she shook Katrina's hand warmly and welcomed her to the team. Everyone took their positions in the center to start a warm up, Katrina stayed at the back, observing everyone's movements, they cycled though plies, tondous and drilled some more contemporary steps. Katrina had to concentrate extra hard on those, her body unused to the hip-hip style. They crumped, shuffled, twisted and charlestoned; the music moving seamlessly though genre after genre. After half an hour they stopped for a break, Lacy being much less of a slave-driver than Madame B. \"What do you think?\" asked Sonja, sidling up to Katrina. \"I love it,\" she confessed, taking a pull from her water bottle, \"are we about to start the routine?\" \"No, we do that on Fridays, I think Lacy wants to run some stunts first.\" Stunts? Katrina wondered silently, but there wasn't time to ask, as the music started again and girls started to spread out along one wall. Katrina followed, leaning against the barre as she watched the other girls perform flip after flip. \"Wanna try?\" asked Lacy noticing her. \"Umm, sure,\" Katrina had done plenty of tumbling in the past at the Joffrey but it ha been a long time since she'd used the skill. \"Its easy, come on.\" And indeed it was, by the end of the practice Katrina was remembering everything she used to love about tumbling, flying through the air and landing as light as a cat. On and on they went; the heavy beat of the music giving new life to the tired dancers as they practiced combination after combination, pyramids, cascades, and lifts. A/N: Hang in there guys, more juicy bits coming up xx AI[Chapter 9] Disclaimer: I own nothing Chapter 9 February 6th Tommy let a rare smile break over his face as he finished his last set of weights and sat up cracking his knuckles. \"What do you think?\" he asked Frank, who had been spotting him. \"I think Marco Santo had better watch his back,\" replied Frank, holding out a hand to help Tommy up. The two had been working-out after hours, rehabilitating Tommy's shoulder and starting to work on his general condition. Frank, disagreeing with the doctor's \"no physical therapy\" diagnosis had given Tommy a long list of exercises he could do every day to strengthen the damaged muscles. He pushed Tommy hard but that was the way he liked it, the exercise took his mind of his other troubles. The two men had sort of become friends, Frank admired Tommy's work ethic, his willingness to do the desk job he was so clearly unsuited for and his quiet sense of humor, a trait that Tommy reveled as rarely as his smile. On Tommy's part he was starting to enjoy working for Frank, being back in the gym where he was most comfortable and being on the road to competing again. Tommy respected Frank's training abilities, drawing out the best in each fighter: Jay's quick fists, Midnight's strength, and Brendon's technique. He longed to be in training properly, sparring in the ring, or working out the day's frustrations against a punching bag. However, Frank had been adamant; he had to wait at least a month for his shoulder to heal after the re-setting and even then would have to be careful. It was at times like these that Tommy wondered why he was still talking to Brendan. The brothers had grown yet closer over the last few days and Tommy was now picking up his nieces from school so that Brendan could stay late and coach the new after-school MMA club. The pair had talked about Tommy coming in to do some demonstrations at the club but so far Tommy had postponed any trips until he was back in professional training. Brendan had fielded endless questions by the kids in his physics class about his younger brother's whereabouts in the months after Sparta and he knew the boys would enjoy meeting their idol. Frank let Tommy head back to the changing rooms whilst he locked up the gym early for the night. Tonight was something of a special occasion for the gym owner, one of his best fighters, Marco Santos, was competing for a UFC title right in Pittsburgh. In honor of the event Frank had organized tickets for everybody and had let his fighters off their strict \"no alcohol\" rule for the night; it wouldn't hurt them to have a beer once in a while. Tommy emerged from the changing rooms in an unassuming black t-shirt and jeans, baseball cap already pulled low over his dark hair. \"Is Brendan coming tonight?\" Frank asked, locking the office and starting towards the door. \"Nah, Rosie's sick so he's staying at home.\" Frank looked concerned. \"Its just chicken pox, nothing too serious this time.\" The little girl had come down with chicken pox only the night before and was currently driving both her parents to distraction with her wails and constant scratching. Frank started the car; he had offered to drive Tommy to the event since Tommy didn't have any means of transportation. Tommy in fact had no intention of buying a car any time soon as he had recently put most of his severance pay into leasing an apartment for the rest of the year. Brendan had helped him pick it out, searching through realtor's magazines in the evenings and discussing the various merits of furnished or unfurnished lets. Considering it was the first place Tommy had ever owned, and the first place he'd ever had to himself, he thought it was very respectable. A small, one room apartment, all open-plan with a mezzanine level for the bedroom, Brendan told him there wasn't room to swing a cat in the place but Tommy liked it for the view and the privacy. He was looking forward to moving out of Brendan's house as well, as much as he was grateful the Conlon family's generosity in letting him stay it would feel good to have his own place As the two men approached the CONSOL Energy Center, where the competition would be taking place Frank started to look around for a place to park. \"Place is packed\" he complained. \"Yeah, Pittsburgh really likes the UFC,\" replied Tommy, pointing out a parking spot to their left. The two of them got out of the car and started towards the stadium, Frank switched direction, heading away from the front entrance and around the side of the colossal building. \"We're going the back way\", he explained, holding up his pass to the security guard at the door. Tommy followed him through the maze of concrete hallways until they reached the locker room housing Marco Santos. The roar of the crowd was muffled by the concrete over their heads and it gave Tommy the strange feeling of being underwater. It reminded him of how he felt before getting into the cage in Sparta, disconnected from the world, alone, and waiting. The lockers were crowded with men, all Frank's professional fighters had been invited to the event, and Marco was so well liked that everybody had come by to wish him good luck. Frank crouched down beside Marco, and started prepping him, wrapping his knuckles and warming him up. Tommy wandered over to Jay, Joe, and Chad, the trio had occupied one corner of the room and were chatting amicably, all taking advantage of Frank's relaxation of the \"no alcohol\" rule for the night. Jay offered Tommy a beer and he accepted, snapping back the top of the can. \"Have you placed any bets?\" asked Jay swigging back his Carlsberg like a pro. \"Yeah, put five dollars on Santos to win his first round.\" \"Who's he up against?\" asked Chad. \"Mad Dog Grimes.\" Grimaced Joe, \"What an asshole.\" \"Just makes it even better when you put a beatin' on him.\" Said Tommy, grinning at the memory. He didn't really have anything against the mohawked fighter but the satisfaction of beating him sure was sweet, the man needed taking down a peg or two. The crowd of well-wishers around Marco was starting to thin out, Frank was shooing people out of the changing room so he could start getting Marco focused for the challenge ahead. Tommy and the others gave the increasingly nervous-looking Marco a wave and a clap on the back before heading up into the stands. As they climbed the last staircase and headed into the stands the noise of the thousands of spectators washed over them like breaking waves. The men started edging along the rows of seats until they reached the ones closest to the ringside- reserved for the fighter's entourage. Within moments of them sitting down Jay offered another round of beers. They talked, drank, and people watched for the half-hour before the fights were due to start, Jay pointing out hot girls in the crowd. The place was filling up, the rumble of the crowd grew ever louder, and Tommy checked his watch, any moment now. As the time reached nine o'clock, the presenter, a local tv-personality, leapt up onto the podium and announced the fighters for the first round. With a rumble of drums Mad Dog Grime's entry music started- Down with the Sickness by Disturbed. The fighter emerged from the tunnel surrounded by his entourage. Tommy noticed that he'd dyed his mohawk bright red and black stripes to match his sponsor's colors. They all booed enthusiastically, Chad shaking a fist at Mad Dog as he passed close by them to leap into the cage. Tommy caught Colt Boyd's eye and nodded at him as the trainer mounted the steps into the cage to prep Mad Dog he'd have to catch up with the old man sometime. \"We got good seats.\" Remarked Joe as they watched Mad dog warming up. Marco's entry music, Beethoven, surged through the speakers and they turned to watch him make his way towards the cage. Unlike Mad Dog, Marco got terrible stage fright until he was safely in the cage and Frank was having a hard time keeping him calm as he half dragged him from the tunnel and within reach of thousand of adoring fans. It seemed that Marco was just as popular with the public as he was at the gym. \"Looks nervous.\" Murmured Chad, concern in his voice. \"Always does,\" replied Jay, \"he's a complete pussy about the crowd but a beast in the cage.\" \"Better than the other way around I guess.\" said Tommy and the others nodded in agreement. Once in the cage, they could see Marco's demeanor change, he straightened up, handed his hoodie to Frank, and returned Mad Dog's glare unflinchingly. The commentators were making much of Mad Dog's return to form after his humiliating defeat in Sparta and this being Santos's first fight after a bad knee injury which had kept him out of the very same tournament. One thing they all seemed to agree on was that this would be a very close fight. The two men met in the middle of the cage, both radiating aggression and trying to stare the other down. The referee had to separate them a little to keep the fight from starting early. \"Gentlemen, I want a clean fight, obey my commands at all times, defend yourselves at all times. Touch gloves, move back… Fight ! \" The fighters exploded into action and the stadium shook as twenty thousand people leapt to their feet. By the second round neither fighter had managed to find a significant hold over the other. They circled the cage like sharks in a tank, sometimes striking out at each other with lightning quickness. Mad Dog tackled Marco to the ground, locking him into a submission hold. Everyone in Marco's entourage jumped up to get a better look at the two fighters, now locked together. Marco wriggled like an eel but Mad Dog's hold tightened inexorably around his throat. He had him deep and Tommy could see Marco beginning to loose consciousness. Thankfully the bell rang for the end of the round and Marco was allowed to struggle woozily to his feet. He staggered to his corner of the cage and was immediately given water by Frank who started mopping at a nasty cut above his eye. \"It's getting serious in there.\" said Chad, shaking his head, he and the other men in Marco's entourage would have much preferred a quick fight, since his injury Marco wasn't as fit as he had been and everyone could see him starting to flag a little. Frank was giving a pep talk; eyes flashing with conviction and the dizzy fighter seemed to rally a little, his eyes focusing. As the bell rang for the start of the fourth round Marco leapt up to meet Mad Dog with a barrage of punches. Mad Dog went down with a kick to the chest, smacking against the side of the cage. Now the fight was even again, both men swaying with the effort of the bout, Mad Dog shaking his head as though to clear water out of his ears. Everybody leaned forward; on tenterhooks as the two rallied and lashed out again, Mad Dog dragging Marco down to the mat for another submission hold. This time however the returning fighter flipped him over and slammed him to the ground with a force that made the arena shake on its foundations. Mad Dog was out cold. It was over and the crowd leapt to its feet again as an elated Frank vaulted into the cage and dragged Marco's arm into the air. The whole entourage followed the victorious fighter back down the tunnel for a victory celebration before the start of the next rounds. The hooting and hollering followed them all the way down to the dressing rooms where everybody milled about congratulating Marco and cracking open a few fresh cans of beer. Finally Frank shooed them all out again so that Marco could have his face stitched up in peace. The brawny fighter was smiling so hard that the nurse was already having a hard time working on his cuts. Tommy left the others for a moment as they mounted the steps to get back to their ringside seats. He was glad for Marco, the man had worked his ass off to get back into shape after the injury that had kept him out of Sparta, and it was always nice to see Mad Dog Grimes beaten into the mat. He wandered down a hallway looking for a men's bathroom, he'd had one too many of Jay's beers. As he rounded a corner he was surprised to see a group of girls, young women really, all dressed in tiny red shorts and crop tops. Just as he'd hoped to get past without them noticing him checking them out, a petite redhead marched right up to him, her hair clashing violently with her outfit. \"Excuse me mister, we're a little lost.\" He looked her up and down, \"yeah, I can see that-\" \"We're looking for the athletes entrance… you know, the tunnel?\" \"Uhh, yeah that's around the other side of the building, just keep on following this hallway until you get to the steps then, take a right.\" \"Thanks, that's really helpful- we're the half time show, don't wanna miss our slot.\" The girl smiled, flashing a set of very white teeth, and sped off with the rest of them. As Tommy stared back after the he realized that each girl was wearing fish-net tights, he grinned to himself as he continued on his way- he would to be sure to get back to his seat in time for the show. Five minutes later and Tommy was ambling back to the stands. He'd taken a wrong turning somewhere in the labyrinth of corridors and was struggling to get his bearings. Up ahead he saw someone round the corner and hurrying towards him. It was a girl, dressed the same as the one's that had asked him for directions. As she neared him, he called out to her. \"You lost?\" The girl jumped a bit, eyeing him up then smiled. \"Totally, and late.\" \"Half-time show?\" \"Yeah.\" She nodded and grimaced- \"I've got five minutes to get on stage and I have no idea where I'm going.\" Tommy didn't want to admit that he was also completely lost so he told the girl to follow him. He glanced at her as they walked together in silence down the corridor. Her slippered feet didn't make any sound and she shadowed him like a ghost. He glanced back at her again, something about her seemed familiar. \"Say, do I know you from somewhere?\" he asked. \"I dunno,\" the girl fixed her doe-brown eyes on his, studying his face; Tommy flushed under her scrutiny. \"Maybe from somewhere- you live in Pittsburgh?\" \"Yeah, work at a gym.\" \"Cool- like a boxing gym?\" \"MMA.\" \" Ooh , so you're scoping out the competition here.\" Tommy nodded \"yeah, something like that.\" Suddenly they turned a corner and Tommy could see the steps leading out to the Tunnel, a tight knot of fishnet-clad girls was waiting at the entrance. \"Wow, you really know your way around here!\" exclaimed the girl, \"Thanks for the help, I'm Katrina by the way.\" She stuck out a small hand for him to shake; up close he could see that her pretty face was covered in freckles. \"Tommy- good luck with your show.\" \"Uh uh- not good luck-\" \"Break a leg, I know.\" Tommy quickly corrected himself. \"That's better, see you around Tommy.\" She flashed him a quick smile and sped off to join her friends. Tommy watched her go, not quite able to stop himself from checking out her ass as she went. Shaking his head he climbed the stairs in search of his seat. He was sure he knew that girl from somewhere- something about her seemed so familiar but he couldn't think what. \"What took you so long?\" asked Jay as he settled into his seat. \"I was a rescuing damsel in distress,\" deadpanned Tommy. \"Ooh, a lady .\" \"Yep. One of them cheerleaders.\" \"Cheerleaders?\" the others chorused, Tommy nodded towards the stage where the girls were filing out onto the raised dais, that held the cage. Their entrance set the crowd cheering again, this time mixed with lewd catcalls and wolf whistles. After a moment of complete silence to let the anticipation build, music started- a high-speed mash-up of Katy Perry's \"E.T.\" with a bas line to make your back teeth rattle. \"Hey, we know that girl!\" Joe pointed to one of the dancers, almost spilling his beer in excitement. \"What girl?\" the others chorused. \"The blonde one, look she's getting lifted up by the others.\" \"That girl?\" asked Chad in disbelief. The girl in question was stretching her leg behind her head in a way that Tommy was sure was not as nature intended. \"Yeah, from the café.\" \"The ballerinas?\" the others chorused again, squinting to get better look. Something clicked into place in Tommy's brain. Of course, the girl he'd helped out was the hot brunette with gorgeous lips and the blonde one was the girl Joe had talked to that one time. \"Wow,\" he said, \"we should go out for lunch more often.\" \"Maybe we should go see the ballet more often.\" countered Jay, with a wide grin. The dance ended with a loud car-crash sound and all the dancers tumbled onto the mat, the crowd cheered and whistled as the girls filed out of the stadium swinging their hips and swishing their hair. The rest of the night was a blur to Tommy; fights came and went, he and the others drank their way through Jay's extensive beer cooler. Alcohol didn't usually go to Tommy's head, being mostly muscle did that much for him, but after his seventh beer he realized he'd had enough. \"Oh man this is going to be brutal.\" Said Chad, Rampage Jackson was squaring up to Marco Santos. The two men were getting in each other's face like pit bulls in a dogfight. \"hmmm?\" replied Tommy distractedly, his head wasn't in the game, he was still stuck on that girl. \"You all right?\" asked Jay. \"Yeah, yeah, how you think Santos goin' do against Rampage?\" \"I dunno man- dude's a monster.\" \"Yeah…\" Jay looked at Tommy sharply, \"I know that look man- you still thinkin' about that girl.\" Tommy blushed, suddenly very interested in his shoes. \"Who'd have though- hard man Tommy Riordan, hung up on a damsel in distress?\" \"I'm not hung up on her- don' even know her.\" Tommy mumbled. \"You thinkin' about her though?\" \"Y- no?\" \"Oh come on, don't have to be a chick about it. How 'bout you get her number?\" \"Her number?\" \"Yeah- come on Romeo, you think she's gonna turn you down?\" \"I bet five dollars that she does.\" cracked Joe, earning him a glare from Tommy. \"Yeah me too\" piped up Chad, clapping Tommy on the back with a hand the size of a dinner plate - \"It's about time you had some fun. Bet she runs the other way though.\" \"Okay okay, challenge accepted .\" He acquiesced with a sigh. \"But if I win, that's five dollars from each of you.\" They all agreed and shook on it. Tommy left the others in the parking lot, he had to take the night bus back to Monroeville, Frank lived in the opposite direction so he couldn't catch a lift. \"You sure you don't want a ride man?\" asked Jay, leaning out of the window of his hulking SUV. \"Nah man, its cool- could use the time to think.\" \"About your girl?\" \"Bout winning that bet.\" Tommy tried to rescue his street cred. \"Sure man whatever you say.\" Smirked Jay. \"Night Jay\" replied Tommy with a wry smile. The bus stop was crowded with people fresh from the fight, still rowdy and pumped up. Still, they left Tommy alone; with his baseball cap pulled low over his face he hopped to avoid recognition and his tattoos seemed to warn off most people. Tomorrow, he vowed visit his father; he'd put it of long enough. Images of the brown-eyed girl darting away from him to join her friends flashed through his mind. He smiled to himself- that was one bet he would make sure to win. A/N In this story I have used a line from one movie and one book (although the line in the book refers to a boy not a girl). First person to find either one or both of the lines gets a virtual gold star and preview into the next chapter. Happy hunting![Chapter 10] Disclaimer: I own nothing! Chapter 10 February 7th Katrina packed her kit-bag extra carefully that morning, lucky scrunchie, lucky tights, thee pairs of pointes, best leotard. She took a few calming breaths. Its just another audition Katy, you're only the junior soloist, there's no pressure… Her audition wasn't until ten and the waiting about in her empty apartment was killing her.Her thoughts drifted back to what Daniel Kline had said on her first day about seeing her \"grow as a dancer\" and about her job not being permanent. It was obvious he wanted to be impressed. That thought was enough to get Katrina heaving over the toiled brown for the third time that morning. The last few days had been almost ridiculously stressful, but exciting at the same time. Her and Vlad's partnership had really gelled and they had the audition piece down pat, unfortunately so did everyone else- competition was going to be fierce. There had also been the matter of the half-time show they'd performed last night, the practices for that had left her dead on her feet for the last few days but, as Sonja had predicted, the pay was good. She'd been able to pay all her bills up front, her landlord gave her a very suspicious look when she paid him in cash. As she locked up the house he though back on last night's performance, the roar of the crowd, the beat of the music, it was nice to dance without having a boss to impress, to do something that they'd all had a hand in choreographing. She smiled to herself, may have also been other perks of the job. The ruggedly handsome man who had guided her to the tunnel entrance when she'd gotten separated from her group was still at the forefront of her mind. His crooked smile, dark grey eyes, tattoos… stop it Katy she remonstrated herself, realizing that she had spent a whole minute standing with her key in the lock. Once safely the bus to work she let her mind wander again. She wondered if she'd ever get to meet Tommy again, he said he lived in Pittsburgh and worked in an MMA gym. She wondered if it would be weird to Google him, there couldn't be that many dedicated MMA gyms in Pittsburgh. No, she decided after a moment, that's definitely weird. The last time Katrina had had a relationship, a real one with promises and flowers sent on Valentine's Day she had been eighteen. Since then a sorry parade of men had straggled through her life most of them lasting only a night, some the whole weekend and once a whole winter. It was the job she reasoned to herself, late nights, antisocial hours, cracked toenails, strict diets, most men got tired of her pretty quickly. Also, sharing an apartment with Casey hadn't helped; Casey's bedroom eyes and long blonde hair drew men's gaze like moths to the flame. Katrina had realized early on that there was only so long a man was going to stick around if there was a \"better deal\" down the hall. She huffed audibly, she had bigger fish to fry today. Today she had an audition to rock. Getting out at her stop, Katrina noticed a crowd of dancers milling around the entrance to the studio. Vlad was amongst them and Katrina tapped him on the shoulder in greeting. \"Hi\" \"Hey\" Vlad ran a hand over his close-cropped hair, up close he looked ill. \"Are you okay?\" she asked, steering him through the entrance to the studio. \"Yeah…\" he answered vaguely, not looing at her. Katrina squared her shoulders and planted herself in his way as he tried to wander off to the men's locker rooms. \"What is it Vlad? What's with you today?\" He looked at her, surprised \"Didn't you hear the news?\" she was about to speak when he cut her off \"Of course not otherwise you wouldn't be asking… anyway, Lauren arrived with Daniel Kline this morning- got out of his car. Its so obvious that they're together or something… anyway, some of the dancers have said that they're not going to audition at all.\" \"Sonja?\" \"Yeah\" he shook his head. \"Wow… I'll talk to her, maybe me and Danni can bring her around.\" \"Maybe, I just don't want her to leave - you know how emotional she gets, might do something she regrets…\" \"Yeah I understand, we'll talk to her. But you- get ready for this audition. We're rocking it yeah?\" \"Yeah. Rocking it.\" Vlad managed a half smile at Katrina's pep talk and turned down the hallway. Katrina found Danni in the changing rooms smoothing down Sonja who was near purple with rage. Neither noticed when Katrina came and sat next to them. She let Danni finish the \"don't throw your career away for nothing\" speech she was giving, nodding in all the right moments and making approving sounds when Danni hit upon a particularly good point. Katrina felt selfish even admitting it to herself but she couldn't help but be annoyed with Sonja. Couldn't she just keep her problems to herself, just this once? Why did she have to go causing trouble on audition day, disrupting everyone else's preparation just so that she could have her temper tantrum? She took a deep breath and turned to Sonja with a smile. \"Do you really want to let Lauren win?\" she asked. Sonja starred at her, tears clinging to her eyelashes \"she's already won Katy, that's what's so unfair.\" \"No, she hasn't won, if you really want that role you have to be prepared to go and get it. Play dirty- just like she does.\" \"Play dirty?\" asked Sonja and Danni together in synchrony. \"Yeah. Go out there, rock your audition with Trev, and then… go and talk to Daniel, voice your concerns like an adult. And don't be afraid to dress up a little\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean , Daniel is a lady's man, he likes to think that we fancy him. So, flatter his ego… you never know where it might get you.\" \"Ego, okay…\" murmured Sonja, wiping ruined makeup off her face and fixing her bun. \"Okay. Thanks guys.\" \"You ready?\" asked Danni, noticing Katrina packing up to go. \"Yeah\" she replied with a false smile, her insides felt as if they were in a blender, \"My number is almost up.\" \"Ooh don't say that, its bad luck!\" gasped Danni, crossing herself. \"I'll say a Hail Mary for you while you're in there.\" Katrina smiled at her to show thanks and nodded to Sonja who was reapplying makeup with a determined zeal and seemed not to notice. Nearing the soloist studio's entrance, Katrina saw that her number was indeed nearly up and she hastened to stretch and warm up, cursing herself for being late out of the house that morning and cursing Sonja's amateur dramatics all the more. Minutes passed, the shivering string music of the audition dance poured from the speakers again and again as pair after pair of dancers took to the stage. Fully warmed up, Katrina sought Vlad in the crowd. He was leaning against a far wall in deep conversation with Mark. As she approached Vlad's eyes snapped up to meet hers. \"How did it go?\" he asked. \"It was fine, she's dancing, but Lauren would do well to avoid her. Where is she by the way?\" \"I don't know, no one's seen her but she should be here soon, She's dancing with Mark.\" \"Oh, right.\" They lapsed into silence, watching the dancers though the glass pane in the studio door. Lacy and her partner Oliver were performing the duet with a fluidity and passion that spoke of Lacy's modern dance experience and Oliver's obvious crush on her. \"They're making a splash,\" noted Mark cricking his neck. \"Yeah, its pretty saucy.\" Smiled Katrina, stretching out her back at the barre, they didn't have long now, only a few more couples to go. Vlad had hurried off to talk to Sonja who had just come in, her make-up reapplied to perfection and game-face firmly on. Mark continued to watch Lacy and Oliver until the end of their routine, whilst Katrina began the task of wrapping up her toes and ankles. The familiar routine reminded her of the fighters from last night. She could imagine them waiting in their own dressing rooms, taping up sore knuckles, psyching themselves up to meet an opponent. The whole team had stayed to watch the fight, the larger fighter, Rampage Jackson , slowly wearing down the other man until finally catching him in a chokehold that offered no escape. The brutality of the sport hadn't shocked Katrina as much a people's obvious enjoyment at such brutality, simulated violence wasn't really for her, she'd experienced enough of the real thing to last a lifetime. Images of the man from last night swam momentarily before her eyes, a crooked smile, tattoos etched onto sculpted arms… I obviously need a boyfriend, this fantasizing is getting out of hand , she thought to herself, shaking her head to clear it of any further thoughts of muscle-bound men. Vlad reappeared in front of her, and offered her and hand to help her up. \"Its time\" he said, voice a little shaky. \"Okay. Let's go.\" She replied, none to steady herself. As they entered the room, Katrina's field of vision seemed to narrow, blotting out the people ranged along the walls of the studio. For a moment she could see Daniel and Dorian and Madame B at a table against the far wall and then everything was dark and still. It took a moment after the music had started to realize that she had not yet shut her eyes. She did so in the heartbeat before Vlad touched her hand and the dance began. Dancing with your eyes shut is not like dancing in the light, your partner is not another person to be accommodated, and the music is not another entity separate from yourself. All parts of the dance have the same origin, and the same impetus, Katrina barely heard the music but she felt it deep within her, suddenly she wasn't acting a part but experiencing the real thing. She felt Vlad's hands under her back and let herself bend, as though in an enchanted sleep, almost to the floor. Her muscled engaging and disengaging to hold a pose one moment and flop lifelessly the next. As the music quivered to its climax and Sleeping Beauty awoke from her slumber Katrina leapt into Vlad's outstretched arms and in that moment she imagined them to be the arms of her handsome stranger. It was over, the shivering string music fading from the speakers. Daniel and the rest clapped politely from their table, Katrina's vision had cleared enough to see them, color slowly refilling her world. Vlad, ever the gentleman, opened the door of the studio and ushered her out. \"What did you think?\" He asked her. \"I should be asking you, I've ha my eyes shut they whole time\" she joked, giggling nervously. Behind them Sonja and Trev were entering the studio, she waved encouragingly and Sonja nodded back. \"I think it went okay, you were really good, rocked the acting and you told me that was your weakest bit.\" Vlad was saying. \"Yeah, I think it went okay as well… we really have to hang around here all day to wait for the results?\" \"Yeah, no class, just auditions for today.\" He replied, running a hand though his buzz-cut. \"Okay, I might go for a walk or something…\" she realized that Vlad was looking at her closely, almost expectantly. \"You were awesome by the way, great lifts.\" \"Thanks\" his expression cleared. They went their separate ways both promising to be back for four when the roles would be announced. Vlad went back to the studio where Sonja was coming out of her audition, Katrina didn't stick around to see how it had gone. She was feeling selfish again, rushing off without stopping to talk to her best friend, she vowed to make up for it later; maybe she'd bring Sonja a coffee or something, just to lift her spirits. By the time she'd made it back in to the changing rooms she was chastising herself again; stop being pathetic Katy! What would Casey say if she saw you acting like a little doormat, pull yourself together and get changed without having some kind of guilt complex about it. She huffed to herself, pulling off her tights and inspecting herself in on of the dressing room's many mirrors. Her thighs were looking a little bigger than normal; she twisted around to get a view from the back. Out of the corner of her eye she spotted someone sitting on the far side of the dressing room, behind the lockers, fear, surely irrational, rippled over her skin. \"Who's there?\" she asked, trying to sound brave. No one answered but she was sure that she'd seen someone sitting there. Abandoning her search for thigh fat she tiptoed over and peaked into the recess behind the lockers. It was Lauren, the girl glared back at her like a cornered ally cat. \"What?\" she asked. \"Are you umm … okay?\" ventured Katrina. \"I'm fine.\" Lauren replied, her argument was made somewhat less strong by the recent tear-tracks outlined in mascara down her cheeks. \"Really?\" Katrina didn't mean to sound skeptical but it must have sounded like that to Lauren because suddenly the girl rounded on her, enraged. \"Come to laugh at the slutty girl have you?\" she hissed. \"What? No!\" Karina backed up a few paces at the venom in Lauren's voice. \"Sure. Everyone's been looking toady, trying to find out why I came to work in Daniel's car- peering in the windows of his office like they're going to snap pictures of us having sex. Disgusting.\" She collapsed back onto the bench, all the fight drained out of her. \"And are they going to find what they're looking for?\" Katrina asked, too curious to be quiet. Lauren looked her up and down for a moment. \"We're in love. He says he loves me.\" Her chin lifted, eyes flashing. \"Well that's good… are you going to audition today?\" Katrina tried to steer the conversation into safer waters. \"I will, with Mark.\" Lauren sighed. \"Its going to be perfect… I could be Snow White.\" She looked Katrina dead in the eye, \"I just want people to believe that I earned it.\" \"Well… the only way to do that, is to earn it. People will see.\" Lauren looked skeptical, \"People will see, even Sonja.\" Lauren nodded, her eyes a little bright then headed into the bathroom where Katrina heard the sound of the faucet running. She turned back to the mirrors and began to pull off her tights, folding them up and pulling on her street clothes. Lauren reentered the dressing room just as she was at the door, the girl offered her the smallest of smiles and Katrina returned it. Katrina looked at her watch; she still had hours to kill. The auditions went on until late in the afternoon, every dancer getting a shot at the roles of nymphs, dryads and royalty. She decided to sit herself down for another coffee. It was strange being out in the city all alone, usually Danni, Sonja or someone would tag along, on their days off the other dancers had been inducting Katrina into the wonders of Pittsburgh culture, they'd been to a number of many of the clubs and bars; \"blowing off steam\" Mark called it. But today everyone was too wound up and stressed out to be good company, no doubt Vlad and Sonja would be either bickering or making out. Danni tried to put on a brave face but Katrina had seen her coming out of her audition as she left the studios and she was pretty sure the girl was on the verge of tears. It was better to wait alone for the news, no good them all sitting around speculating over the decision and picking apart their performances. The hours slipped by as she wandered from shop to shop, distractedly looking at clothes and shoes, frustrating shop-keepers by trying everything on and buying nothing. Eventually she headed for the bus stop to take her back to Liberty Avenue, heart already starting to race. By the time Katrina reached the doors of the studios her pulse was throwing its self against her skin, the pressure starting to build up behind her eyes. She stopped for a moment, breathing in the fresh February air, calming herself before pushing open the doors and entering. The first thing she noticed was a huge crowd of dancers around the receptionist. Mrs. Lawrence was looking more harassed than usual, her red lips pursing. \"No. For the last time, the list goes up when it goes up, and not before four o'clock! So now shoo, scat, go away !\" She swatted at the people nearest with a stapler and the dancers scattered before they could be further verbally abused. Katrina followed the crowd, giving the receptionist's desk a wide berth. The clock ticked slowly down to four, the dressing room was silent although packed with people. Most girls were feigning nonchalance, texting boyfriends, or painting their nails. Katrina however had spotted Danni sniffling in a corner and wordlessly joined Sonja in handing her tissues and rubbing her back. According to Sonja she'd been crying ever since she'd left her audition. Dorian Toulouse, the visiting choreographer had started laughing half way though as she'd fluffed a jump, after that the whole thing was just a lost cause. Poor Danni's French-flag manicured hands were still shaking. Someone poked their head around the door, from her position at the back Katrina could just make out a mass of dark, curly hair. It was Lacy, her normally tanned skin almost milk-white. \"It's up!\" she stage whispered and then vanished back around the door to avoid being trampled by the hoards of dancers. \"Should we go?\" Sonja asked the others, hanging back from jointing the crowd of girls fighting to get into the hallway. \"Sure.\" Said Danni, a resigned look upon her face, \"I may as well see just how bad the damage is…\" \"I can't believe he actually laughed in your audition.\" Katrina said as they joined the back of the line for the door. \"I mean, that's rude .\" \"It sure is\" agreed Sonja. Because this production of Snow White relied so heavily on a small cast of main dancers it had been decided that two dancers would be cast in every main role, each cast performing on alternate nights. This offered everyone a double shot at the best roles. As the nervous trio approached the list pinned to the wall outside the director's office they ran headlong into a seething mass of people; some celebrating, some commiserating and all in the way. Vlad was near the front and reached back to pull Sonja and the others through the mass of people. Being so much smaller than most people Katrina had to hang on tightly to Danni's arm to avoid being swept away in the crush. Before Katrina had even got a chance to glimpse the list it's self Danni threw herself into her arms with a sob before dashing off weeping openly. Christ almighty! Thought Katrina, as she dove through the crowd again hoping for a better look. And then she saw it. Katrina Christensen- The Deer (1) (Snow White alternate 2) Whoa. Katrina spent a long minute rooted to the spot with shock. A solo and an alternate role? A huge grin spread spread its self over her face. Before fighting her way back thorough the throngs of dancers she took a moment to scan the list for familiar names, she was ashamed to say that she still didn't know the names of everyone in the company. There, Mark was one of the two Princes, Katrina knew he and Lauren had had a stunning audition. A tidal shift in the crowd pushed Katrina off her prime spot and she found herself on the outskirts of the group. She didn't wait to talk to anyone else, keen to keep this moment of joy all to herself. She waltzed off down the corridor, feet barely touching the ground, she had her own solo and an alternate role for the main part! Katrina was under no illusion that she would actually get to dance Snow White in front of an audience but , one could dream. Dark was gathering on the way to the bus stop soon it would be night, eager not to be out too long after dark, Katrina hurried home, not stopping to talk to anyone outside the dance center. Out of the corner of her eye she spotted Lauren getting into a dark sedan an expression of triumph on her usually impassive face. It was fully dusk by the time Katrina arrived home, few people were about on the streets but the thumping baseline of a house-party reverberated though the night air from one of the apartment blocks. She enjoyed the short walk from the bus stop, down the long Oakland Avenue, shaded with trees. The air was chilly, clouds of steam rising in front of her as she breathed. As she came within view of her apartment building Katrina saw a car pulled up outside, someone had been unpacking boxes onto the street. Maybe they're moving in she though idly, pulling out her keychain as she approached. The car pulled away, leaving the lone person with their boxes on the side of the road. He stepped under a streetlamp, the orange light leaching the color from his red Tap out Crew t-shirt and all of a sudden, Katrina knew who he was. \"You want some help?\" she asked masking her surprise and drawing level with the man who was struggling to open the front door with two boxes balanced in his hands. \"Sure\" he replied gruffly, throwing her a cursory glance. He almost dropped both boxes on the double take. \"Say, haven't I seen you before?\" He looked at her properly now. \"From last night?\" Katrina asked unlocking the door and standing aside to let him in. He didn't move. \"Yeah at the tournament.\" Tommy pointedly stood back to let her go first through the door and, getting the hint, she stepped inside. \"So you're Tommy?\" she asked once they were both safely in the bright lights of the foyer. \"Yep. And you're Katrina, right?\" Under the lights Katrina could see that the t-shirt he was wearing was several sizes too small for him, it hugged every inch of his torso as if it were painted on. She tried not to stare. \"And you're really moving in here? \" she asked. \"What does it look like I'm doing?\" he asked, a slight quirk to his lips now. \"I just…can't hardly believe it. Weird coincidence right?\" \"I guess it's a small world.\" Tommy said, pushing the lift call button. \"Very small.\" Katrina was tempted to pinch herself to make sure she was awake. She was afraid that the stress of the auditions might have kicked her already active imagination into overdrive. The pinch hurt, she was definitely not dreaming. There was an awkward silence in the lift until the third floor where Tommy made to get out. On some crazy impulse Katrina reached out a hand to stop him. \"Is that all your stuff?\" she asked. He looked at her, surprised. \"Yeah? Why?\" \"Well how about you come up for a coffee- when you're done unpacking.\" She asked, trying to sound more confident than she felt. He flashed her a lop-sided grin and stepped out of the lift. \"What's your number?\" \"37.\" \"I'll see you there.\" Katrina fell onto the couch in a daze as she reached her own apartment but after sixty seconds of immobility she leapt up. Dashing up to her bedroom, such as it was, she stripped off her worn sweater and picked a burgundy camisole from the draws. Jamming that over her head she scurried back down the tiny staircase and into the bathroom. Good she looked a mess. She quickly brushed her hair, applied a slick of lip gloss and mascara before remembering that she hadn't brushed her teeth and having to apply the lip gloss all over again. Not that anything was going to happen, but it still had to be done. After a once-over in the mirror she headed to her tiny kitchenette where she set to tidying with a fervor her mother would have been proud of. Just as she'd managed to throw the last of the dirty dishes into the washing machine, someone knocked on the door and she jumped about a foot in the air. Be cool Katy she reminded herself as she took a calming breath. He's just a guy… a hot guy… really hot guy… but just a guy. With one last deep breath she unlocked the safety chain and opened the door. A/N Sorry for the wait guys, this chapter was sooo hard to write but in the end I had to stop obsessing over it and just post it, so here it is, hope you like it![Chapter 11] Disclaimer: I own nothing Chapter 11 February 7th Tommy awoke with resolve firmly in place. Today he would visit his father and Brendan would go with him. It was strange, he thought to him self as he shaved in the mirror, that the bombs and bullets of Afghanistan scared him less than going back to the house he'd grown up in. His nightmares were as constant as ever, although he was better at hiding them, he no longer cried out in his sleep and when he woke in the dead of night, he forced himself to remain still and silent. Tommy didn't suppose the dreams would ever stop, the images of his friends bleeding out in the sand were as fresh in his mind as the day it had happened. All the same, the broken nights were catching up to him, dark circles etching themselves deeper under his eyes. By the time he was dressed the rest of the house was waking up, he could hear Emily and Rosie bickering as they got ready for school and Tess scolding one of them gently. Tommy almost smiled to himself; he would miss the sounds of family life when he moved out even if Tess's voice sometimes was sometimes so like his mother's that it brought a lump to his throat. There had been plenty of those moments, and Tommy could see now how a sixteen year old Brendan would chose to stay behind to be with a girl like that. Tess's presence softened the blow of loosing his mother, and his father also. Tommy could see himself being jelous of that, having that constant person in your life- somebody to trust. He wondered if he'd ever find a girl like that, someone to take the pain away. There had been plenty of women in Tommy's life; he had needs after all like any man and was charming enough when he wanted to be. Some girls were drawn to the damage, had been since high-school where he was a quiet, intense loner. No friends but some girls just couldn't help themselves, he hadn't treated them well- fear of cruelty making him cruel himself. Once, a girl had tried to stop him as he got out of bed, putting his clothes on as soon as they were finished. She'd tried to be kind, hanging around him at school, helping him with homework, never asked for anything she was younger, inexperienced. Tommy knew when he was taking advantage. He could have loved her, given her the things she deserved, he didn't. The guilt only hit him as he walked away. He was like his father wasn't he? He'd stayed out all night not able to face his mother and her illness. When Monday rolled around he'd he found he couldn't face the girl either, so he dropped out of school. Since then it he'd ben all about the physical, no feelings just sex, or so he hoped. Manny had tried to set him up with a few of Pilar's friends, all very pretty but he never really took an interest. He wasn't cut out for a relationship, all that sensitive stuff. You're no good at it, and you don't need it he told himself firmly, getting up and going down for breakfast. All his things were packed up for him to go to his new apartment. Brendan had made him go to Costco to buy some crockery and bedding for his new place. Now he had some boxes as well as his duffle bag, it was a first for him. Tess was staying home today, looking after Rosie whose chicken pox was still in full swing. As Tommy came into the kitchen he saw her and Rosie sitting together at the table, Brendan and Emily must have already left for school. \"Good morning\" said Tess brightly. \"Morning.\" Tommy returned putting some bread into the toaster. \"How you feelin' Rosie?\" \"Itchy and scratchy.\" The little girl replied grumpily, she held up her hands to show him how they were now incased in mittens. Tommy laughed and Rosie stuck her tongue out at him. \"Are you going in to see your dad today with Brendan?\" asked Tess, joining him in the kitchen for a fresh cup of tea. \"Bren tell you about that? Yeah, we are, It's about time I guess.\" \"Well I hope it goes ok.\" She said her eyes full of concern. \"Thanks.\" He said quietly. He knew that caring about everyone and everything was only part of Tess's nature, but sometimes she came too close, looked too close. Tommy had to fight down the habitual anger that he threw against anyone who dared show him compassion, push down the walls that threatened to rise up against her. One day he'd get that all under control he told himself. \"You're moving into your flat today?\" asked Tess, putting some dishes into the sink. Tommy nodded in place of a response. \"We'll miss you around here, you have to promise to visit yeah?\" she looked at him seriously. It was nice, Tommy thought, she meant that genuinely. \"I will, definitely.\" \"Good.\" She smiled and left him to his breakfast. Rosie finished her cereal, complaining all the time about the lack of Lucky Charms in the house, apparently all the cool kids in first grade had them for breakfast then took the marshmallows in to school for break. Tess was having none of it and Rosie had to suffer on with All Bran or Weetabix. \"One day you'll thank me for this\" intoned Tess as the two climbed up the stairs so that Rosie could go back to bed. Tommy watched them go, finishing his toast in solitude. As she reached the top of the stairs Rosie suddenly turned and sprinted back down. To Tommy's great surprise she threw her chubby arms around his knees. \"Miss you uncle Tommy!\" she told him, giving him a gap-toothed smile. Tommy leant down and picked up the little girl, ruffling her curly blonde hair. \"I'll miss you too Rosie, now you be good y'hear?\" he set her down and let her run off back to bed. Tess caught his eye with a smile. Tess was letting Tommy borrow her car as she was staying home with Rosie so the commute in to Frank's gym was quick. Tommy fiddled with the radio, switching to a local DJ who was talking about last night's fights and the CONSOL Energy Center. It was a shame about Marco loosing, the man had tried his hardest but coming back from an injury in the end he was no match for the brute force that was Rampage Jackson. Marco had made it into the third round, putting up a good fight but everyone could see he was the under dog. Eventually Jackson got him deep in a chokehold until he tapped. Oh well , Tommy thought to himself, at least he beat Mad Dog. Watching the fights had reminded him exactly what he was missing during his recovery. His desire to fight again burned somewhere deep in his chest, to Tommy fighting had long been his only means of expression. It was his only safety valve against the anger that had pulsed and coiled under his skin since before he could remember, the anger that, when unleashed, turned him into someone he didn't recognize. Going to the tournament had been fun for Tommy, it was a long time since he'd been able to hang out and have a drink with friends. He hadn't had anyone to hang out with since Manny died, nor the inclination. He hadn't always been a loner, the men he'd known in the Marines had been closer to him than brothers, he wasn't sure that he'd ever have friends like that again. Their deaths had changed him, hardened him to the world. He fiddled with the radio again, narrowly avoiding being blindsided by a car crossing lanes. The thought of seeing his Pop again was making him nervous whether he liked to admit it or not. Having Brendan with him was going to be weird too, his brother had been so adamant for so long that he would never speak to his father in person again. And now, he was willing to let go of that to go with Tommy. The brothers hadn't spoken about it, the Conlon family habit of silence prevented it but Tommy knew Brendan was feeling at least as bad as he was. His brother had rushed out of the house like it was on fire that morning if the sounds in the kitchen were any indication, no doubt wanting the distraction of his job. Work was slow, Tommy was too uptight about seeing his father that evening to be much conversation. Jay was on his day off- apparently spending the day in bed with a girl he'd picked up last night after the tournament if Chad was to be believed. The place was mostly empty today- Frank was in his office talking to sponsors so Tommy waived at him through the window. Frank had finally let Tommy off desk duty, they'd agreed that it wasn't exactly his strong suit. Instead he had Tommy in full time training- rebuilding the strength he'd lost in the past six months and getting back the range of mobility in his shoulder. Without the prescription of painkillers given to him by the doctor Tommy could still feel he bones grinding against each other as he lifted weights. He welcomed the pain; it helped to keep him focused. It wasn't as if he had much choice, painkiller, mood stabilizers, anti-depression drugs- he'd been down that road before. After he'd deserted his unit in Afghanistan, still reeling from Manny's death he'd turned to pills to dull the pain, make him functional. He hadn't appreciated until months later just how dependent he'd become to them. Not until Pop had forced him to give them up so he could train again. the withdrawal symptoms hadn't been so severe that he couldn't hide them but the sweating, shivering nights up in his old bedroom had been enough to convince him never to touch the stuff again. Days like today though, he wished he still had some codeine in his jacket. It was about four when Tommy spotted his brother entering the gym, he caught his eye and then went straight for the showers to get cleaned up. Dread pooled in the pit of his stomach at the thought of going back to that house, maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all. Stop being a pussy he told himself, standing up heading for the car. It was dark in the house, all the blinds drawn down. Pop lead them into the sitting room where he collapsed back into his easy chair, bloodshot eyes peering at them through the gloom. Brendan was looking around, examining old family photos he hadn't seen for twenty years. Tommy on the other hand couldn't tear his eyes from his father. This was a shadow of the man who had trained him for Sparta. The dad Tommy had known from six months ago had been as fit and strong as an aging ex-alcaholic could be expected to be, he'd taken care of his car, his house and, although Tommy hated to admit it, his son. Now, that man was gone. In his place was the father of their childhood nightmares. He reeked of sweat and stale liquor; his clothes, obviously slept in. As Brendan switched on the overhead light, Tommy could see that his father's eyes were red as the devil, bloodshot and struggling to make them out. He came closer, kneeling at the man's feet. \"Hey Pop, how've you been?\" he asked quietly. His father looked sharply down at him. \"Fine Tommy. Been wonderin' when my boy was gonna come see me.\" Tommy threw a glace over his shoulder at Brendan who didn't react to their father's choice of the singular. \"I'm here Pop. I'm back. You been takin' care of yourself? Been going to the AA?\" Tommy hated to hear himself ask. Why should he care if the old man was going to his damn meetings? Anger, undirected at anyone in particular, rose in his chest. He pushed it down. \"I ain't been goin' any more Tommy. It's no good, I ain't sick, just tired. I had one thousand days sober before Atlantic City, ain't had one since. Don't want one neither.\" With a shaking hand the old man reached under his seat for a hidden bottle, raising it to his lips he took a deep pull. Smiling absently, he offered it to Tommy who shook his head. \"What's the matter? I'm just tryin' to show you a little hospitality.\" \"I'm fine.\" \"What'sa matter?\" Pop's voice rose, the color rising in his bristled cheeks. \"Too good for it? Or do you only take those damn pills now?\" Brendan looked up sharply from the other side of the room. \"I'm not takin' no pills Pop.\" Replied Tommy evenly, standing up away from his father. He was fighting the urge to be sick, so strong was the smell of filth clinging to the man. Brenan took Tommy's place in the small circle of light thrown by Pop's reading lamp. Their father's face broke in to a smile, the lines and crags lifting somewhat. \"Brendan, my boy. You here too?\" \"Yeah Pop, I'm here. I'm here to get you some help, we think you need it. Get you back into the AA?\" Tommy looked sharply at Brendan, trying to warn him off the topic, but the damage had been done. Pop bristled visibly, fingers clenching around the whisky bottle. \"Get out. \" he growled, Brendan didn't move, Tommy had to hand it to him, the man had balls. \"Get out!\" their father roared, spit flying. With a crash the whisky bottle smashed against the nearest wall, staining the pale wallpaper and splattering family photographs. No one in the room flinched. Pop deflated somewhat. \"Brendan, you can't… you can't. I'm your father .\" The pleading voice that Tommy had grown to so despise was back but this time their father wasn't begging for forgiveness. The two younger men looked at each other for a long moment, the only sound in the room was the ticking of the old grandfather clock in the hallway. All of a sudden, Tommy began to feel claustrophobic. The weight of their shared and painful past in this house pressing down on him, smothering him. Without another word he stood up and left slamming the front door behind him. Sitting down on the steps he watched his breath cloud in front of him. It was just like the night when he first returned to Pittsburgh, waiting with a bottle of whiskey for his father to come home. It had been as cold that night as it was now and he'd almost given up before he saw the old sedan wending its way down the street. The car was up on blocks now, a dustsheet covering the paint. \"Fuck\" Tommy swore out loud. The anger he'd been denying himself was burning in him now- he'd never wanted to hit someone or something so badly. He clenched his fists until they hurt, forcing himself to stay sitting and silent. Still, Tommy knew that the rage he felt now towards his father was the easy part- the guilt would come later, would leach into his bones like an acid. This was, after all his fault. The old man was doing fine without him- going to meetings, trying to make things right with Brendan and Tess. That was until Tommy ruined all of that for him- destroying everything he'd worked to rebuild. No wonder he couldn't stay sober now. Light spilled onto the porch behind him as Brendan stepped outside and sat down. Neither man said a word for a long moment. Tommy looked over to see that Brendan's eyes were very bright. \"You alright?\" it took him a moment to bring himself to ask the question. Brendan took a deep breath before answering. \"Yeah, just give me a minute.\" They sat in silence once more. \"What are we gonna do?\" asked Tommy when Brendan seemed more recovered. \"I dunno. We don't have to do anything.\" Tommy raised his eyebrows, he'd never thought of his brother as hard-hearted. \"Okay, we do have to do something. We can put him in rehab- there are some residential programs.\" \"He won't thank us for it.\" \"Not right now, no.\" the knowledge of their father's anger seemed not to phase Brendan, which made Tommy wonder how bad things had been after he and mom left. Brendan was always the one who idolized pop, never seemed to blame him for what he did. But, Tommy wasn't ready to ask, and Brendan wasn't ready to tell. \"Okay, lets go,\" said Brendan after a long moment. Neither man looked back towards the house as they got into the car but Tommy could swear he felt his father's gaze on his back. It was a quiet drive back to Monroeville and Brendan's house. Tommy stared out of the window, purposely avoiding his brother's gaze, hoping also to avoid any conversation. The guilt, long anticipated had settled like a mantle over his shoulders. The sight of his father's bloodshot eyes boring into his, the smell of stale whiskey and unwashed clothes clung to him. It was a while before he realized that his hands were still clenched into the fists he'd made on the porch. His fingers were stiff as they uncurled. The anger was gone now, dissipated and directionless but the weight of the guilt more than took its place. This was his fault of course, pushing the old man to have a drink again and again. Six months ago the sight of his father drunk, ill and helpless would have given Tommy and intense sense of satisfaction, it would have been just what he deserved. Now, this long-sought victory didn't bring any pleasure, especially knowing that Brendan would shoulder this new responsibility for the both of them. \"You got everything you need for the new apartment?\" asked Brendan, breaking the quiet. \"Yeah. It's all in the back.\" Replied Tommy glancing over at Brendan at last. The other man was still slightly pale but his grip on the steering wheel was steady. Tommy felt a bit sorry for his brother, being dragged back into their uncomfortable family history despite the fact that it was the last thing he'd wanted. Now Brendan's moral conscience would demand that he look after the father he'd grown to despise, provide for the man who'd made his life a misery and left scars on him that even Tommy didn't know about. \"I'd better get back to Tess once I drop you off.\" Said Brendan, pulling onto Oakland Avenue at last. The sun had just dropped behind the rows of skyscrapers in the distance and dusk was falling. A party was going on in one of the apartment blocks, the heavy bass music rattling the windows of the car. \"Its okay, I don't have more stuff than I can carry up myself.\" Tommy replied. Neither man wanted to stay long in the company of the other. The knowledge of their father's situation was wedged uncomfortably present but impossible to broach. Brendan nodded and parked under a streetlamp. He didn't get out as Tommy opened the trunk and removed his two boxes and duffle bag or clothes. Tommy wondered if deep down Brendan didn't blame him for their father's relapse just as much as Tommy blamed himself. Brendan rolled down the driver's side window and leaned out to say goodbye. \"Tommy. We'll figure something out okay?\" Tommy nodded wordlessly. \"How about you come to dinner on Sunday night?\" Brendan ventured, \"The girls are going to be missing you…\" Tommy smiled, touched. \"Yeah, I'd like that- need to sort myself out a car one of these days.\" \"Yeah, then you can drive the girls to school for me.\" \"Well I don't know about that , but I will visit.\" \"I'm glad. Gonna miss having my little brother around.\" Brendan smiled. \"You take care okay?\" \"You too\" said Tommy, \"thanks for the lift.\" Later, in a matter of months, maybe a year the brothers would have hugged goodbye but not tonight. Tommy gathered his boxes into his hands, slinging the duffle bag over his shoulder. It was going to be a long night- as pleased as he was to have his own apartment, Tommy wasn't looking forward to the solitude as much as he thought he would. The thought of living entirely on his own, the quiet, the privacy- he hadn't thought about the loneliness, it hadn't occurred to him that he would have anyone left to miss. Tommy's hearing, honed by years in Afghanistan, only caught her footsteps moments before she stepped into the pool of light by the apartment doors. Jumping slightly at the sound, his key slipped out of the lock. \"You want some help?\" the girl asked from somewhere on his right. \"Sure.\" Tommy glanced at her as she fished in her handbag, sleek brunette hair, doe-brown eyes. Where had he seen that before, he whipped around to look at her properly, so fast he almost dropped his boxes. \"Say, haven't I seen you before?\" He tried to be cool as she unlocked the door, seemed like he might win that bet sooner than he thought. \"From last night?\" the girl, Katrina, he remembered, stood back to let him in. \"Yeah, at the tournament.\" The image of her in the tiny red shorts and fishnets swam in front of his eyes. It took Tommy a moment to realize that the girl wanted him to go through the door first, he stood back deliberately- Ma had taught him better manners than that. As the girl stepped into the lobby, Tommy had to stop himself from checking out her ass again, three times before knowing her last name seemed ungentlemanly. In the lights of the lobby he could see the girl looking at him intently if he didn't know better he would say she was checking him out- he felt his ego swell up. \"So you're Tommy?\" she asked. \"Yep. And you're Katrina, right?\" she was even prettier than he remembered, without all the stage make-up on. \"And you're really moving in here? \" \"What does it look like I'm doing?\" he felt himself start to smile. The girl moved towards the lift, swinging her long dark hair over one shoulder. She was saying something about coincidences, Tommy found himself more interested in the sway of her hips. \"I guess it's a small world\" he supplied, in answer to her question. The lift was tiny- Tommy, feeling totally off his game had nothing to say and silence fell between the two. He racked his brains for a way to ask for her number without coming over too strong, and drew a blank. The lift doors opened for the third floor, Tommy's floor. He was about to get out, ticking himself off for missing an oppertunity, when the girl reached out as if to hold him back. He turned. \"Is that all your stuff?\" she asked. That wasn't the question he'd been expecting. \"Yeah? Why?\" \"Well how about you come up for a coffee- when you're done unpacking.\" She caught his eye, then flushed it suited her. He smiled, \"What's your number?\" \"37.\" \"I'll see you there.\" As the doors closed Tommy allowed a wolfish grin to break out over his face. Jay and the others be dammed, lady luck was on his side for this one. Unlocking the door to his new apartment, Tommy ventured inside. It was small, all one room really with a mezzanine level bedroom and a big window overlooking the street. To give himself something else to think about than coffee with Katrina, Tommy set to quickly and efficiently unpacking his boxes. First went the sheets into the cupboard, then the single set of plates, cutlery and glasses into the kitchen. He made his bed, put his clothes in the closet and contemplated changing out of his ratty t-shirt. Girls could always tell if you'd made an effort to look good for them- not wanting to give anything away, he decided against it instead washing his hands briefly. He passed, back and forth around the living room, such as it was. Tommy didn't want to be early and look keen, but he didn't want to keep her waiting either. The suspense was killing him, patience was never his strong point. Unable to take it any longer he gathered up his keys and headed upstairs to 37. She opened the door almost as soon as he'd finished knocking. As soon as he saw her he wished he'd changed his shirt. The red top she was wearing glowed against the smooth skin of her bare shoulders, chasing most coherent thought out of his mind. Tommy forcibly pulled himself back together, it had been way too long since he and Manny would pick up girls in bars. \"Hey.\" He ventured, his voice very rough. \"Come in.\" she replied. Her apartment was just like his in proportions except that it faced the opposite side of the building, facing across the rooftops into central Pittsburgh. It was warm in the apartment, warm in the way he was sure his could never be, a lived-in feeling that put him at ease. \"So…\" the girl started, leading him towards the kitchenette, She brushed aside his offer of help with the coffee and steered him towards a stool. \"Its ok, I can manage.\" He sat, watching her quietly as she gathered things, hands quick and light. \"So…\" she ventured again, \"where did you just move from?\" \"Was stayin' at my brother's house before now.\" \"That's nice,\" said Katrina from over by the sink. \"so you're from the area?\" \"You could say that.\" Tommy realized that he was being unnecessary cryptic, \"I was away a long time.\" \"And now you've come home.\" \"Yeah, I guess I have.\" \"It's never the same as when you left is it.\" said Katrina, stirring sugar into one mug, the kettle was starting to steam. \"I dunno about that, sometimes its like nothing's changed at all.\" She nodded, to show she understood. \"And you're a fighter?\" she asked, pouring out the water. \"Yeah, I had an injury though but I'm back in training now.\" \"So I might see you in the ring sometime- here\" she pushed a steaming mug towards him. \"Thanks,\" Tommy wasn't really much of a coffee drinker but if it kept him up all night tonight, he'd be happy. \"So what do you do when you're not dancing at the CONSOL center?\" She laughed, \"I'm a ballet dancer with the Pittsburgh company.\" \"Really?\" so Chad was right then. \"Yeah, I just started there a few weeks ago actually.\" \"So you're new to the 'burgh?\" \"Pretty much, lived in Chicago before this so it's not too much different.\" \"Chicago… never been.\" \"Well, its nothing like the musical. I moved there to got to the ballet school when I was eight and then danced in the company when I graduated.\" Tommy's eyebrows rose. \"You started at eight? Seems kinda young to be away from home.\" \"I guess, my mom lives in Maine, on one of the islands, there's no school there or anything really so she was happy I didn't have to be homeschooled,\" If Tommy had been anyone else he might have asked about her father, as it stood, he didn't. \"What about you, said you've been away from Pittsburgh for a while?\" He nodded, not saying anything for a moment, choosing his words carefully. \"I was in the military- did a couple of tours before getting into fighting.\" \"Wow, military,\" she took a gulp of coffee, seemingly about to say something- Tommy got the feeling she was going to ask why he left and was about to cut her off. \"When'd you get your tattoo?\" she asked, tilting her head to the side the get a better look. \"This one?\" he pointed out the dark tribal markings on his right arm. \"Yeah- it's a lot of ink for one guy.\" \"I got others.\" \"Seriously?\" Unconsciously he lifted up his shirt a little to show her the masks on his chest and the words across his abdomen. \"You weren't kidding\" she stepped closer, coming to his side of the bench. Tommy felt heat rushing to the surface of his skin, wondering what her hands would feel like on his chest. He dropped his shirt and reached for his coffee. \"You got any ink?\" She shook her head, \"Scared of needles, I don't know what I'd get anyway.\" \"That's smart- I got my first one at sixteen, no real meaning behind it\" he gestured to the tribal tattoo, \"kinda regret it now.\" \"I dunno, think it looks pretty cool.\" Katrina said, catching his eye. \"sounds like you were a bit more of a badass teenager than me- my major rebellion was dying my hair blonde., nothing so permanent.\" He laughed, Christ, he didn't think he would be laughing today, but here it was, right in a cute girl's kitchen. \"Can't imagine you as a blonde.\" \"Don't, it was horrible.\" She giggled. \"the principal of my school made me get a boy's haircut so it would grow out faster.\" \"Seriously?\" it was his turn to be surprised. \"Yup. It was so embarrassing.\" They'd both finished their coffee and Katrina offered him another which he accepted. It was strange- half an hour ago he'd felt the weight of the world pressing down on him, but now, well, this girl was a good distraction from all that. They finished their second cups in relative silence, Tommy guessed that she'd had a long day by the look of the dark circles under her eyes. She yawned. \"Sorry.\" \"All that coffee not doing you any good?\" \"Its decaf.\" \"Decaf? What's the point of that?\" \"Well I'm not going to ply you with caffeine at this time of night am I?\" \"'Spose not… decaf … do you have a cell phone?\" She looked at him, thrown by the change of topic. \"Yeah… doesn't everyone?\" \"yeah I guess so… anyway, what's your number\" he didn't mean to blurt it out like that- maybe he should have planned something smoother to say. \"Umm…\" she tipped her handbag over the table looking for her phone. \"Here, the number's on the screen.\" He took it, their fingers brushing ever so slightly. \"I'll have to take you out for a real coffee sometime.\" He said, handing the phone back. She blushed again, Tommy had the feeling he was too. \"I'd like that,\" \"Yeah me too\" of course you do or you wouldn't have suggested it idiot! Tommy mentally berated himself. \"I umm, should probably go, its getting late.\" He set his mug down. \"Thanks for the coffee Katrina\" \"You're welcome,\" she showed him out, he hesitated a split second at the doorway. Would any other man kiss her on the cheek goodbye? He was close enough to do it, tantalizingly close. He decided against it, bidding her goodnight gruffly. \"Bye\" she replied softly, smiling. The image of her in the doorway would haunt his dreams that night, chasing away thoughts of his father's house. A/N sorry about the wait guys! Hope you like it- this chapter was so hard to write so any comments/ critique would be very welcome xx[Chapter 12] Disclaimer: I own nothing Chapter 12 February 8 th Katrina pulled her jacket tighter around herself- the bitter wind was starting to bite that morning and her fingers were going numb in their mittens. She was sitting on the steps of the dance studios re-reading a text. It had arrived whilst she was on the bus, her loud ring-tone prompting the pensioner next to her to give her a truly disapproving look. It had been so crowded on the bus that morning that she couldn't even reach her handbag to pries her phone out of it so she'd had to wait. The text was from Tommy, debunking all the myths that men never called you when they said they would. Hey Kat, it's Tommy here's my number Have a good day. It made her feel all funny inside when she read it and she kept grinning to herself like a complete idiot. It wasn't exactly the most romantic of messages, no kiss, no declaration of undying love… maybe she was getting ahead of herself? She flipped the phone shut and went reluctantly in to work. Katrina walked into the soloist's dressing room and was at once struck by the uncharacteristic silence. Everyone was getting dressed very diligently and quietly, looking no one else in the eye. Rounding the corner of the lockers Katrina froze. The \"WHORE\" was emblazoned on Lauren's locker- in blood red lipstick. Lauren herself was nowhere to be seen but her bag was sitting on the bench, some of the stuff spilling onto the floor. Katrina picked up what had spilt and placed it back inside. She caught Sonja's eye- the redhead shook her head and placed a finger to her lips. Five minutes later, just as Katrina was putting her hair up into a bun, the door flew open, banging off its hinges and making her jump-spilling bobby pins everywhere. Lauren stalked in, her eyes red-rimmed and cheeks blotchy with crying. She glared accusingly around the room before snatching up her bag and stalking out. What in the name of God is going on? Katrina wondered. She dragged Sonja into the loos with her so they could finally talk. \"What happened?\" she asked, avidly. \"Well you saw her locker didn't you?\" Katrina nodded. \"Lauren went crazy, literally, I've never seen anything like it. You know she got snow white?\" \" Really ? Not surprising though, she's an amazing dancer…\" Katrina kicked herself for not checking the cast list properly. \"Well now she's claiming she's being bullied- just can't handle people knowing she screwed her way to the top.\" Scorn laced Sonja's voice. \"Oh I don't know Soni, I think she worked hard to get where she is.\" Sonja jumped down from the counter where she'd been sitting, \"believe what you want- you shouldn't be so trusting Katy.\" She headed for the door, leaving Katrina alone and feeling vaguely guilty, both for arguing back to Sonja and for not sticking up for Lauren. Doormat alert , her conscience warned her and for once she had the good sense to listen, squaring her shoulder and going into class with head held high. Her inner serenity didn't last long. Madame B had her practicing balances for her deer's solo. Up on tiptoe with the other foot behind her head, Katrina's knees began to shake and the older lady pursed her lips. \"Again\" she ordered and Katrina restarted the sequence, transitioning through the agonizingly slow pattern of movement. Inner peace was the key to this- an empty mind made the balancing easier just like yoga. Unfortunately Madame B's baleful stare was making unwanted thoughts whizz around her mind like a swarm of hornets. She stumbled and tripped into the next pose. \"I've seen enough.\" Declared the ballet mistress, throwing her hands up in despair, \"go and practice on your own!\" Grateful not to have been hit with a slipper, Katrina scuttled for the door where she went slap into Lauren coming in the opposite direction. The blond girl glared at her before pushing past into the studio almost slamming the door on Katrina's fingers. Christ no wonder everyone hates her thought Katrina, heading to an empty studio for some more practice. Settling her self in, she fished the CD for her solo out of her handbag. Digging deeper she found her phone, flipping it open and reading Tommy's message again. Tentatively she began to text back. Hi Tommy, Thanks for the text How about that coffee? She read it and shook her head- coming on too strong. Starting from scratch, she wrote- Hey Tommy Liking your new flat? The area's not great but the neighbors are fantastic K This sounded better, so with a quick prayer she hit send. Katrina stuck on the music and got up to practice but before the first bar had run though her phone chirped, sending her scuttling back to check it. The flat's great but I don't know about the neighbors Decaf? She blushed to the roots of her hair clutching the phone to her chest- immensely flattered that he'd messaged back so quickly. Not wanting to come off needy she set her phone to one side and put the music back to the beginning. It was hard to focus when all she could think about was what to say back. Should she remind him that he said he would buy her a drink? Should she ask how his day was? Should she play it cool and not say anything at all? The music ended and she realized that she was standing on the wrong leg, facing the wrong way. Concentrate! Katrina chided herself, looking hurriedly at the windows to make sure no one was watching. Ok try again. The music started and she raised herself up on tiptoe leaning and reaching and tipping to the left but before she could complete the next step, inspiration struck. Abandoning the dance she leapt back to her phone-texting at lightning speed. Well maybe you should show me how it's done? Stopping to reread it she grinned to herself, perfect. She wouldn't send it yet. The music was almost over and Katrina was feeling foolish- like a little girl with her first crush. Putting the phone firmly back in her bag and burying it under a pair of tights she applied herself to practicing with renewed zeal until lunchtime. \"Katy!\" someone was running up behind her as Katrina exited the studios for lunch hour. She turned, nearly sliding backwards off the icy steps. \"Woah there\" Sonja caught her hand just in time. \"Thanks.\" Said Katrina, stepping safely away from the stairs. \"You dropped your phone by the way.\" Sonja's eyes were sparkling mischievously. She held it out but as Katrina reached for it she whipped it away. \"Who is Tommy?\" she asked, phone behind her back. \"Give it Sonja!\" Cried Katrina, trying to reach around her friend but Sonja laughed and danced out of reach. \"Who is he?\" she asked again. Katrina briefly buried her face in her hands; she'd never hear the end of this one. \"Do you remember the guy who showed me where to go when I got lost on Saturday?\" \"Yeah? The hot one with the muscles?\" Sonja was now so curious that she didn't notice Katrina's fingers inching toward the phone until she whipped it out of her grasp and scampered down the steps. Sonja gave a squawk of temper and set of after her in hot pursuit. \"Tell me tell me tell me!\" she cried as they raced down the icy street. Katrina, having the longer legs pulled away from her but, as they slowed down Sonja caught her arm. She was strong for someone so small. \"Alright alright.\" Conceded Katrina. \"So Tommy , who is gorgeous by the way, is now my next door neighbor!\" \"He's stalking you?\" asked Sonja. \"That's what I thought at first but actually it's just the world's hugest coincidence, way weird right?\" \"Weird good though.\" \"Weird amazing . Except that I'm gonna have to wear full makeup when I'm at home just in case he knocks on the door.\" Sonja laughed, breath solidifying like a cloud in the freezing air, the temperature had fallen again and flakes of snow where lazily drifting down. \"I feel like we should be doing the nutcracker again with this snow.\" sighed Katrina, snow always reminded of the rare Christmases at home. \"I'd probably get cast as a rat.\" Replied Sonja, somewhat dourly. She'd been cast as an evil queen for the forthcoming production. Privately, Katrina thought it was just the part for her, not that Sonja was complaining, next to Snow White it was one of the best roles. The group had done well in general; Mark was a prince opposite Lauren, Vlad was a satyr and totally psyched at the possibility of furry trousers. Danni on the other hand had only managed the most basic of background roles and had reportedly been caught crying the bathrooms between classes. They were almost at the café when Sonja spoke again. \"So are you and Tommy… you know…\" \"you know- what?\" \"you know … doing it… and by it I mean sex.\" \"uh thanks for that clarification… no, I don't think he fancies me.\" Sonja raised her blue eyes to heaven. \"Oh Katy, is he gay ?\" \"not that I could tell…?\" \"Then he fancies you.\" Sonja said with finality, opening the door of the café and darting into the warmth. \"How can you know that, you haven't seen this guy up close, I bet he has women coming out of his ears- groupies. \" \"Groupies?\" asked Sonja as the slid into the booth, she snuggled up close to Vlad. \"Do you mean like he's someone ?\" \"Everybody's someone Soni.\" Replied Katrina, pretending to peruse the menu, she didn't want the rest of the group interrogating her too- especially as she hadn't sent that text yet. Nothing was on a firm footing. \"But… do you mean he's like famous? A fighter ?\" asked Sonja loudly as though she'd just heard Katrina's thoughts and as deliberately sending her up. \"Well I don't know about famous, but he's a fighter yes.\" By now the whole table was hanging on her words, Danni's fork was suspended half way to her lips. \"What's all this?\" asked Mark, amusement sparking in his cat-like eyes. \"The world's most gorgeous man has moved into Katrina's apartment block.\" Gushed Sonja, Vlad frowned at her. \"Okay, second most gorgeous.\" Mark pretended to pout. \"Alright, alright, third best then- but still a knockout. And that's funny because he's a fighter and has groupies !\" \"I never said he actually had groupies, I was just speculating!\" interjected Katrina, feeling her ears go red. \"Never mind, I'm sure he does.\" Chuckled Mark, \"even I have groupies- have to keep passing them off to friends.\" The table burst into laughter- earning them a few looks from builders and auto shop workers massed at the bar. Katrina's good mood carried her for the rest of the day, not even much dented when she sent her text after lunch and didn't hear back. She floated back to the studios and got on with stretching and warming up her muscles of the evening class- technique and conditioning with Daniel Kline and Madame B. This was the one everyone dreaded. Madame B pushed the dancers to and past their limits in an effort to impress Daniel and the dancers in turn wrung every drop of energy from their already tired bodies in an effort to shine. Katrina had taken to saying a quick prayer before each of these classes- asking God to protect her from making a fool of herself; as though God had anything to do with her petty concerns. Today however, her hands strayed from their rosary beads and into her handbag to check her phone. It was as though God really was watching over her, she had one new message. How do you feel about Irish coffee- tonight. Dirty thoughts about Irish cream cropped up in Katrina's mind, she could practically see his crooked smile on the other side of the line. How was she supposed to concentrate in class now? Her rosary winked accusingly at her in the dressing room lights. Muttering a Hail Mary as she pulled her hair into a bun, Katrina left the dressing room. This class was going to be the longest of her life. Much later, after broken toes, after tantrums that shook the studio windows, after Madame B walking out and much impassioned Latin argument, class was over. Katrina slouched at the back of the bus on the way home, legs crossed on the seat, head resting against the window. She'd pushed herself hard and was already starting to feel her muscles cramp in the tight space. The bus was almost empty, only a few elderly women sat in the rows ahead. She stretched, clicking her knees loudly, flexing her back. Everything ached but in a good way, the ache of hard work, all the same a coffee would do her good. Pushing open the door to her apartment she bustled inside, dumping her dance bag on the floor and heading into the shower. Soothing her aching muscles under the hot water, she wondered what she should wear to see Tommy. The man slightly unnerved her with his magnetic good looks and intense gaze. Her eyes were always drawn to him wherever he stood, whenever he moved with that strange grace for a man so large and strong. She dithered over what to wear before realizing she was being silly, this wasn't a date. She firmly put back the pretty pink lip-gloss she was about to put on and reached for a cardigan to put on over her blue strappy top. Putting her thick, dark hair up into a ponytail and putting blusher onto her pale cheeks. She stopped in front of the mirror again; pulling out the pony tail she piled her hair up on top of her head. Satisfied, Katrina made to go. Not a date she reminded herself, just coffee with a hot guy… Really hot guy… Reaching Tommy's she knocked softly for a second all was quiet, maybe he wasn't home. Then the door opened and there he was, Tommy had obviously just got in from work he was still in tracksuit and t-shirt. \"Hello.\" he said, voice gruff, moving aside so that his bulk didn't block the door. \"Hi\" Katrina slipped by him into the flat. It was a typical bachelor's pad, no decoration other than two framed photographs on the mantelpiece. Tommy hovered behind her as Katrina looked about; he hadn't been lying about those two boxes being all he was moving in with, all the shelves that in Katrina's flat were stuffed with photos, mementos and farewell cards, were bare. \"Coming?\" Tommy led her into the kitchen where the kettle was boiling, a bottle of whiskey stood, mostly empty beside two mugs. Katrina settled on a stool at the table, Tommy busied himself at the kettle. The silence between them stretched, oddly comfortable for two people who were virtual strangers. Tommy flexed his shoulders, straining against his slightly too small t-shirt, Katrina's stomach flipped over. Tommy pushed a mug of coffee at her across the counter. \"Here\" \"Thanks\" she took a sip and nearly choked- \"Tommy! This is err…\" she coughed, \"strong.\" The corners of his mouth twitched. \"Too much whiskey?\" he asked. She giggled, alcohol warming her chest and burning down her throat right down to her toes. \"I dunno, I kinda like it.\" she took another tentative sip and nodded in agreement. \"Just what the doctor ordered\" said Tommy, raising his own mug in a toast. They settled on the couch facing each other, Katrina sitting Indian style with a cushion on her lap. \"So, how was your day?\" she asked, not sure of the etiquette for non-date conversation. \"Was alright.\" Tommy nodded thinking for a moment. \"Been in the gym today, been sparring for the first time in a while…\" he took a swig of coffee. Katrina could see the bruises forming along his knuckles. \"That's exciting, so you actually fight for a living?\" she asked in wonderment, \"Don't you ever worry about getting hurt?\" She felt stupid of asking but Tommy didn't seem to mind, in fact he laughed, somewhat bitterly. \"Already been hurt, dislocated my shoulder last time I was in the cage. Been recovering ever since.\" He patted the offending limb fondly. \"I guess it don't bother me any more.\" Katrina nodded to show she understood, taking another gulp of Tommy's lethal coffee. She felt her throat burn as it went down but that was nothing to the burn must have felt as his shoulder popped out of the socket. She suppressed wince at the thought. Alcohol working in her blood she told him about her day, auditions, class, the gossip at the studios, being chased down the street by Sonja. Somewhere along the way Tommy admitted that he'd never been to the ballet. \"No surprises there.\" She laughed. \"Well you never know, I could be a real sensitive guy\" he flashed her one of his rare, crooked smiles. \"Sure, and I might secretly be into weightlifting\" Katrina countered, she got a laugh with that one. \"Do you want to go somewhere?\" Tommy asked suddenly, Katrina realized that his mug was empty. \"Where?\" \"I dunno, out for a walk?\" Tommy's knee was bouncing now. \"It's snowing! And minus a million degrees out there!\" \"You can borrow a jacket.\" Not going to take no for an answer Tommy was already up and moving. \"Okay, wait.\" Katrina drained her coffee. \"You okay to walk after that?\" he asked concerned as she swayed a little on standing. \"I'll be alright, its not like they can charge us with S UI.\" \"What?\" Tommy looked stumped, \"Strolling under the influence.\" \"Oh-\" the crooked smile was back- Katrina felt it was a bit of an achievement to pries it out of him. Tommy lent her a big black fleece that reached almost to her knees like a dress when she zipped it up. Donning a black skull cap and jacket he made to leave, holding the door open for her. \"You look like a burglar.\" Katrina noted as Tommy locked up. \"And you look like a twelve year old,\" he countered, \"are all ballerinas this short?\" \"I'm not that short. I'm tall enough for the New York and Paris companies- grew an inch in my final year at school and that saved me, I'd have been too small otherwise.\" \"So you can be too short? What happens then?\" asked Tommy out of curiosity. \"I dunno, it's harder to find a job I guess, there are rules about how you have too look.\" \"Sounds a bit of a shit job. If you've got a talent that's what matters.\" He said bluntly, ushering her down the stairs. \"No worse than getting beat up for a living though.\" He nodded in agreement. The cold them like a slap in the face as they stepped out of the front doors and Tommy steered her across the street and off into the night. Looking back the next morning, Katrina couldn't be sure of exactly what they talked about. The events were slightly blurred in her hangover-fogged brain. The pair had wandered down town through the quiet streets. All the normal sounds of the city slightly muted by the fresh fallen snow and lowering clouds. After the initial shock, the whiskey and the bulk of the man beside her kept Katrina warm. She had vague recollections of strolling through a silent park, laughing about something, she did most of the talking but about what she couldn't remember. One thing however did stick out in her mind, as she lay tangled in her sheets the next morning throat dry and eyes itchy. She'd asked him about his family, tired of talking about herself. For a moment Tommy's eyes were almost black in the hash orange glow of the streetlamps. He was a silent a long time, the only sound being the tramp of their footsteps on the fresh snow. \"My father and brother live here in the 'Burgh… my mom's dead, long time ago.\" \"I'm sorry to hear it.\" Katrina said, giving him space to continue. \"This wasn't such a great place to grow up…\" Tommy looked away from her, out into the gloom. \"Mom and I left the old man behind, then she got cancer.\" He sighed, plowing on. \"After she died I joined the Corps, barely waited for the funeral.\" She looked up at him and he caught the sympathy in her expression. \"I don't want pity.\" He said shortly, \" There ain't nothin' will change what happened but me n' Bren are on good terms now.\" Katrina took that to be the brother, Tommy's eyes softened slightly as he mentioned him. \"And your dad?\" she asked tentatively. \"Not worth talking about.\" Tommy hunched his shoulders against the cold. They didn't speak much on the way back, the dark of the night was broken only by the streetlamps and their dull reflection off the snow, a diffuse, soft glow of light. Katrina knew that Tommy hadn't told her the whole story about his family, she didn't blame him, they were almost strangers after all. She hadn't told him everything either. She remembered Casey chiding her about keeping secrets in school \"secrets don't make friends Katy\" was what she'd always said. Glancing at Tommy next to her, his eyes staring far ahead into the darkness, looking across at her every now and when he thought she wouldn't notice, she wanted to know him, wanted him to know her even, secrets and all. What was the best way around this man's armor? Katrina knew the walls around Tommy's heart were as strong as Fort Knox, she knew men like that. He's just your neighbor her inner voice reminded her, emotional healing is off the cards. Tommy walked her to her door and waited as she slipped off the fleece and handed it to him. \"Thanks for the coffee, I'll sleep well tonight.\" \"Me too, it was nice to see you...\" Katrina could swear he was blushing. As if an inner voice brought her down to earth. \"See you soon?\" she asked, feeling a fool. He nodded wordlessly, his gaze never leaving hers, then he reached down and squeezed her hand briefly, his warm hand dwarfed hers totally enclosing it. This close Katrina could feel the heat coming off him like a furnace. Before her heart had time to skip a beat Tommy turned and headed off towards the stairs. Katrina tingled where he'd touched her a glow in her chest burning like she'd swallowed a whole vat of whiskey. A/N Sorry for the wait guys! I've been away (excuses excuses!) anyway I hope you can forgive me xx[Chapter 13] Disclaimer: I own nothing Chapter 13 February 8 th It was early morning, Frank's gym was still quiet, but for the grunting efforts of the true fanatics who turned up to hone their bodies before most people were even out of their beds. Tommy padded quietly across the carpeted gym floor and into the locker rooms, choosing a bench close to the back. He started to change out of his street clothes into board shorts and a wife beater, stopping occasionally to stretch the stiff muscles in his neck and arms. Used to the atmosphere of a military base he didn't usually mind the crowded, noisy gym full of frat boys and \"hard\" men, today however he was glad that it was mostly empty- mornings were his time to think, to train in peace before Frank needed him to work in the office or on the front desk. This morning he had more to think about than usual. His very distracting neighbor for instance; the girl flitted through his dreams and kept him awake for hours at a time. He knew it was stupid, letting some girl he didn't even know under his skin but there she was, he'd even got half-made plans to see her again. She wasn't his type, he usually went for leggy, busty, blondes with low morals to match his own \"las putas\" Manny used to call them. Nevertheless, the knowledge that she wanted to see him again had been the biggest boost to his ego since beating Mad Dog Grimes into the mat at Colt's gym. He smiled slightly to himself, he'd even won his bet. With this happy thought Tommy made his way into the main body of the gym to train. Anyone watching Tommy that morning would have detected a bit of extra swagger in his step as he stalked towards the weights. He sat down on the bench-press nearest the wall, looking around at the other men. This was an old army habit, he hated to feel exposed and having the wall on one side of him was almost like someone having your back. Jay and the others hadn't arrived, usually they congregated around the bench presses, betting on who could lift the most, larking about and making a nuisance of themselves. The place was strangely quiet even for this early in the morning- the scrape of the bar as Tommy lifted it seemed to echo around the warehouse. He counted lifts in his head, anything to block out the burn in his shoulders and arms, and the sneaking suspicion that he was being watched. Fame did not suit Tommy Conlon well, he avoided crowded spaces at the best of times and didn't appreciate strangers coming up to him on the street. Usually it was just well-meaning kids wanting an autograph or to ask about Brendan, he never knew what to tell them about his brother and always ended up being much blunter than he'd intended, rude even. Occasionally people would get aggressive, trying to square up against him, he always set them straight. It was the lack of anonymity he hated- before Sparta he was nobody, a deserter from the army, a blank spot on the map; now he felt like someone had trained a spotlight onto him, he had that constant creeping feeling of being watched. He knew this was mostly paranoia but it didn't stop him wearing a hoodie most places that he went. The doors banged open and Jay hurried inside, rubbing his gloved hands together to ward off the chill winds of the morning. He waved at Tommy before disappearing into the locker rooms. Tommy thought of the bet they'd made at the fights the other night- he hoped Jay remembered to bring his wallet to work. He wondered how his neighbor was doing, was she up yet? He set the weights back on the bar, sitting up and cricking his neck- Frank had been upping his workload like a slave driver recently. He reached into the pocket of his hoodie and drew out his cellphone, a beat-up Nokia that had seen better days. He had Katrina's number already programmed in, he started to compose a text. What the hell was he supposed to say? His fingers, already too large for the Nokia's tiny keys became clumsier still in his indecision. With a sigh he deleted the text- seven in the morning was probably too early for that sort of thing anyway. All the same, he should probably work out what he wanted to say, a little planning never hurt. Not being hugely communicative or prone to making friends, Tommy had only ever owned one other mobile phone, his mates in the Marines ganged up and bought him one for his twenty first birthday saying that he needed dragging into the twenty first centaury. Tommy lost that phone the day he lost every one of his friends to the desert in that rain of fire and heat. Unbidden the image of Manny coughing out Pilar's name along with his last breath came to his mind, the cloying heat of midday in Basra Province and the smell of burning flesh. His hands jerked suddenly as though trying to catch hold of Manny's jacket one last time, the phone clattering to the floor. Someone laid a hand on his shoulder and Tommy's head snapped up. \"You okay?\" It was Frank, he handed Tommy back the phone. Tommy nodded wordlessly, half his mind still lost in the past. \"Sure? You looked a million miles away there.\" Frank continued, adding more weight to Tommy's bench press bar. \"I'm fine.\" Tommy said roughly. \"Okay, have a go with this.\" He gestured to the weights and Tommy lay back, taking them up with a grimace. \"You're killin' me here Frank\" he said, starting the set with difficulty. \"Gotta get you up to strength if you're gonna be sparring again soon.\" Frank answered with a slight smile. \"How soon?\" asked Tommy, lifting the bar again, feeling his muscles burn in protest. \"How about today? You can go against Niko at twelve- get you back in the game.\" Tommy nearly dropped the bar. \"Seriously?\" \"Would I lie to you man?\" asked Frank with a grin, he obviously liked dishing out good news. Tommy said nothing but his nod was enough. The morning passed without incident, Tommy did his morning's training, pumping iron endlessly before catching up with Jay by the punching bags, the pair only made it five minutes before Jay got it out of him about Katrina. \"She's yo' neighbor man?\" the big fighter asked, stopping dead mid-punch. \"Yup.\" Replied Tommy turning back to the bag. \"And you got her number?\" asked Jay. \"Yup.\" \"And?\" Jay let the question hang in the air until Tommy stopped punching his bag and fixed him with such a dead-pan look that he almost didn't ask again. \"And?\" \"And… nothing.\" \"you haven't called her?\" \"Nope.\" Jay reached into Tommy's pocket and pressed the phone into his hand. \"Well that's gotta change- I did not bet five dollars on this for you to screw it up first chance you get.\" \"Oh come on, what am I gonna say to her anyway?\" Tommy felt the heat rise into his cheeks. Jay shrugged his massive shoulders, \"I dunno- just tell her this is your number, no big deal.\" \"Yeah, no big deal.\" Tommy began laboriously to text- his fingers were much too large for the keys and every second letter was a mistake. Finaly he re-read the message; Hey, This is my number Tommy He was about to press send when Jay put a hand out to stop him, Tommy reluctantly handed over the phone, this is like fuckin' high school all over again he thought mutinously. Jay sighed, tuning to him. \"Do you like this girl?\" Tommy looked at him blankly, \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, do you want to sleep with her? \" Jay sounded like he was explaining algebra to a five year old. \"Yeah?\" Tommy replied, non-plussed and frankly a little pissed off. \"Then write somthin' nice for love of God!\" \"Nice?\" Jay sighed again \"you ever date a girl before?\" \"Yeah?\" \"I'm gonna take that to mean no.\" \"But-\" \"Just say, have a nice day . Simple.\" Tommy nodded, typing it in with difficulty. It took a good half hour for Tommy to convince Jay that he wasn't still a virgin. By the time they'd finished with the punching bags, worked on the tread mill, warmed down, and were heading to the locker rooms for a break Tommy was pretty sure that putting a beating on his friend might just be the quickest and easiest way to make his point. Suddenly his phone rang, digging it out of his sweats he saw that it was a text from Katrina, Jay tried to read it over his shoulder until Tommy hit him with a towel. Hey Tommy Liking your new flat? The area's not great but the neighbors are fantastic K Tommy felt a stupid grin break out over his face, Jay wolf-whistled, smacking him on the back but Tommy said nothing, just sat down and applied himself to texting back. When Tommy stepped out of the showers ten minutes later, the steam rising from his skin he found the locker rooms were full of people. The bulk of Frank's professional fighters were here along with a smattering of enthusiastic amateurs training over the lunch-break. Tommy dried off and pulled a t-shirt over his head, digging boxers and sweats from his bag. After dressing he checked his phone, the drop in his stomach when his inbox came up empty surprised him- why should he care if she didn't answer straight away? Because then you know she doesn't like you as much as you like her, his conscience told him. He was feeling stupid again, Katrina was just some chick- there had been plenty like her and there would be plenty more in the future. That he didn't fully believe this worried Tommy, getting attached to women, especially ones he barely knew, was not a thing he did, not now and not ever. Scowling slightly, Tommy strode out of the locker rooms back into the main body of the gym. Abandoned in the bottom of his kit-bag, his phone chirped. Frank was waiting for him as Tommy mounted the steps up to Ring One, it stood on a dais in the center of the warehouse. Niko, his sparring partner, was already there- diligently wrapping up his knuckles and strapping on sparring shields. Tommy squared his shoulders, taking the tape from Frank and wrapping up his own hands. \"So remember what we talked about, nice and slow right?\" Frank was saying, the rushing of blood in Tommy's ears was drowning out the sound- it was always like this before a fight. Tommy nodded mutely to show he was listening and ducked under the rope to meet Niko. Any fight in Frank's gym always attracted a lot of attention, the professional sparring sessions were usually attended by a small crowd of hangers-on and groupies. Frank tried to keep the place quiet but they always got in, it was common knowledge that Midnight sold tickets to his sparring sessions on the quiet. This session was no different- many men had set down their weights and abandoned their punching bags get a good view of Tommy \"soldier\" Conlon's return to form. Tommy stood in his corner, bouncing from foot to foot with anticipation- the ring was where he felt most at peace, only when he was fighting did he really feel in control. As the bell rang and he and Niko touched gloves the sound of the surrounding crowd faded away and he let instinct take over. This turned out to be a mistake. The stone in weight that Tommy had lost during his time with the Marines in the past six months was never more obvious than when he was matched against the man-mountain that was Niko Chambers, Frank's heaviest middle-weight fighter. Tommy was used to being the strongest man in the ring, to being the aggressor, setting the pace. What Tommy was not prepared for was Niko picking him up chucking him across the ring like a rag doll, the back of his sparring helmet smacked hard into the ground and black spots clouded his vision for a moment. The next moment he was back up and swinging, going for Niko's legs with a quick kick that connected hard with the shin guards and sent the man sprawling, like many larger fighters, speed was not Niko's strong point. Not wanting to get pinned by his opponent, Tommy stood back and let him get to his feet before attacking again with a barrage of punches to his head-guard. Again, Niko's strength worked in his favor and he dragged Tommy down to the mat. Tommy felt the other man's forearm bend his collarbone to the point of snapping. What would Brendan do? he wondered dimly, the black spots were back and the cheers of the spectators were starting to echo in the background. Copying a move he'd watched Brendan pull in Sparta, Tommy slid an arm under Niko's chest and used the pressure to flip himself up out of the hold. He staggered to his feet, black spot clearing from in front of his eyes and head back in the game. Thanks Bren he thought, laying Niko out with a vicious punch to the gut, the man reeled back against the ropes but rallied and Tommy had to duck quicly out of the way. The bell rang and both fighters retreated to their corners, chests heaving with exertion. \"Move or die Tommy.\" Chuckled Frank, handing him some water, \"You're gonna have to find another way to beat this guy, don't do the same things, I want to see you try a different thing.\" Tommy nodded, handing back the water. \"I gotta fight like Bren.\" He mumbled almost to himself. \"Thattaboy.\" Frank clapped him on the shoulder and sent him out into the ring. The second round was just as brutal as the first, still wrapping his head around this new fighting style Tommy was dragged to the mat twice more, both times wriggling like an eel to free himself. He began to watch Niko more carefully, trying to pre-empt him, striking on the side he left exposed before backing off. Eventually he found his chance, the larger fighter threw Tommy to the mat for the third time but this time Tommy managed to twist around so that he had Niko in a headlock, he twisted again, pressing his elbow into the hollow of the man's throat, sweat was now dripping into his eyes. After half a minute of increasingly desperate thrashing, Niko tapped. Both men righted themselves, gasping for breath. \"Good fight.\" Rumbled Niko, offering Tommy a hand the size of a dinner plate. \"You too man.\" Tommy returned the handshake before ducking out of the ring. Most of the men were leaving the ringside now, bloodlust satisfied, Jay however remained. \"Brilliant! You were killin' it out there!\" he whooped, punching Tommy in the arm. Tommy grinned, spitting out his mouth-guard and undoing his helmet. \"So, you going pro now?\" asked Jay, helping Tommy un-tape his hands. \"Yeah, reckon so.\" Frank was bearing down on them so Jay left them to it, ambling back to his punching bag. Frank punched Tommy on the shoulder in a friendly sort of a way. \"You were great- I like seeing a fighter who can think on his feet.\" \"So what now?\" Tommy felt himself relax. \"Now you train, spar, we'll get you up to weight and into matches- if you're sure about trying Sparta again that is.\" Tommy nodded wordlessly. \"Okay, then we need to have you back in the ring professionally in at least three months time- sooner would be better but I don't want to push it.\" \"Good. Great\" Tommy cracked a smile which Frank returned. \"Get on then- warm down.\" Suitably dismissed, Tommy left the ring the combined rush of the sparring session and knowing that Sparta was once again on the horizon making him almost giddy. Tommy unwrapped the last of the tape from his hands and ran them under the cold tap- bruises were already forming across his knuckles after the sparring session. He rolled his shoulders, gratified that the pain was not too bad, Frank's exercises had obviously been working. The energy of the fight was still singing through his blood making the world seem brighter and sharper than before, he'd missed this. He bent over the taps, intent on washing off some of the blood from a split lip. The adrenaline still numbing any pain but it would catch up with him eventually. Straightening up, he caught sight of Niko on the far side the changing rooms; the man was inspecting a cut across his left eye. \"You alright?\" Tommy asked. \"Yeah- I won't be sparring against you again in a hurry though.\" chuckled Niko in a deep bass voice. Tommy left him to it, rummaging around in his kit bag for his towel. His phone clattered to the floor and he picked it up, cursing. His frown soon turned into a smile as he saw that Katrina had texted him back. Split lip forgotten, he opened her message. Well maybe you should show me how it's done? He grinned, then winced, tasting blood. By the time Tommy got home it was nearly dark outside. The beating he'd taken from Niko was starting to tell on him, the back of his head still throbbed from being thrown into the mat. He let himself in, dumping his kit bag on the floor. Having already showered and changed at the gym there wasn't much to do but wait for Katrina to turn up. He pulled a half-drunk bottle of whiskey from one of his mostly-empty cupboards and emptied a considerable amount of it into two mugs. He resisted having a few shots himself to calm his nerves. Tommy looked around his flat, there wasn't much in it, just a few photographs on the mantelpiece and some crockery in the cupboards. He wished now that he'd never invited Katrina over to see it- the contrast between her warm homey apartment and his only threw his situation into greater relief. Before he'd much time to brood over this, before he'd had time to put the kettle on or to rub Deep Heat into the bruises forming across his ribs, someone knocked lightly on the door. Tommy crossed the room and pulled it open, on the other side stood Katrina, hand raised to knock again. Tommy had nearly forgotten how pretty she was. \"Hello.\" He said, lamely. \"Hi.\" As Katrina slid past him into the flat Tommy caught the smell of her perfume- it reminded him of the flowery sent his mother used to wear on special occasions. For a moment he was catapulted back into the memory of his mother kissing both her sons goodbye before she went out to dinner with their father on their last anniversary together. The sent still clung to her the next day when Tommy and Brendan visited her in the hospital. Shaking his head slightly as though to clear it, Tommy started for the kitchen. Turning he saw that Katrina was intently looking around the flat, taking in the bare shelves and walls with those luminous deer's eyes of hers. \"Coming?\" he asked. They didn't speak again for several minutes. The silence wasn't awkward the way it was between he and Brendan, full of things unsaid, instead it was relaxed, just enjoying each other's company like old friends. \"Here\" He passed her a drink and Katrina thanked him, then took a sip and almost spat it back out again. Tommy knew he'd been overgenerous with the whiskey out of nerves. Her cheeks went bright pink after the second sip- Tommy decided that it was his new favorite color. They moved to the couch, Tommy knew his habit of fidgeting would turn into pacing if he stayed standing much longer. He noticed as they both settled down that Katrina was small enough to sit cross-legged without her knees going off the edge of the couch. The alcohol was starting to work on him, blurring the edges of everything, bringing him down off the high he'd been on since sparring at the gym. He told her about it, showed her the fresh bruises on his hands and was surprised by the concern flashing across her face. \"Don't you ever worry about getting hurt?\" she asked, eyes full of worry. Tommy was momentarily stumped- did he? As far as he was concerned if a fighter was worried about getting hurt then he wasn't in the game. Sparring was all the preparation you needed to know what you were getting yourself in for. He told her about his injury in Sparta, leaving out the part where his brother had been his opponent, he wasn't ready to talk about that yet. Something in his voice must have come across to Katrina because suddenly, and to Tommy's relief, she changed the subject. He listened as she filled him in on her day, nodding here and there to show he was paying attention. In truth he was enjoying watching her lips while she was talking. Ballet was something his mother liked, it seemed like another world to Tommy. He remarked to Katrina that he'd never been. \"No surprises there.\" She giggled. Tommy had to defend himself from that one \"Well you never know, I could be a real sensitive guy\" he smiled at the thought. \"Sure, and I might secretly be into weightlifting\" Katrina raised her skinny arms in a mock-heroic pose. Tommy laughed and she laughed along with him. Tommy glanced out of one of the mullioned windows and realized that it was snowing heavily outside. All of a sudden he had the urge to be outside and moving. \"Do you want to go somewhere?\" he asked. It took a bit of convincing to persuade Katrina that she wouldn't freeze to death on their walk. After a moment she agreed, draining her mug and swaying dangerously. \"You okay to walk after that?\" Tommy asked, he'd forgotten that alcohol worked quicker on girls, she'd think that he was trying to get her drunk- not that he was above that sort of thing. She made a joke of it and Tommy supposed that if she could still joke, she'd be fine. The cold night air whipped around them as they exited the building blowing snow into their faces that stuck in Katrina's hair and on her eyelashes. Tommy led the way, heading north towards the park. Katrina did most of the talking and for that Tommy was thankful, she was incredibly easy to be around, filling in the spaces in their conversations as though she knew he didn't like to talk. It was only when they'd almost reached the end of the park that she asked him a question. \"So where are your family now?\" Tommy glanced up at her in the harsh glare of the streetlights. It was a moment before he could answer, he weighed his words carefully starting with the basics. \"\"My father and brother live here in the 'Burgh… my mom's dead, long time ago.\" Her platitude of sympathy was entirely lost on him. \"This wasn't such a great place to grow up…\" he began, not knowing how to proceed so he just died straight in with it. \"Mom and I left the old man behind, then she got cancer. After she died I joined the Corps, barely waited for the funeral.\" Tommy old guilt he felt at leaving his mother's fresh grave stirred in him again. It was perhaps because of this that he snapped at Katrina \"I don't want pity.\" Because you don't deserve it Tommy thought to himself. , \" There ain't nothin' will change what happened but me n' Bren are on good terms now.\" He felt it was important to show her that he wasn't a complete lost cause, at least his brother he could talk about without wanting to hit something. \"And your dad?\" Katrina aksed in a very small voice, Tommy felt bad about snapping at her now. \"Not worth talking about.\" He replied bruiscly, guilt making him less communicative than ever. It was a quiet walk back to the apartment building, Tommy kept glancing over at his pretty neighbor when she wasn't looking. Her eyelashes were so long they kept catching snowflakes that she had to rub away as they melted. She started to shiver, rubbing her arms to keep warm. \"You're cold.\" Tommy said, feeling bad about dragging her out on such a freezing night. She nodded wordlessly and he picked up the pace, anxious to get her home before she froze. He left her at her front door. \"See you soon?\" she asked, Tommy felt his ego expand in his chest. He nodded touched that she wanted to see him again especially after how he'd acted. Before he could stop himself he'd reached down and squeezed her tiny hand in his. Her fingers were freezing; they were so close together that he could have kissed her without taking another step. He let go of her hand and backed off, down the hall. It was only a moment later that he'd been holding his breath. Later, lying in bed, Tommy picked his phone off the bedside table, turning it over in his hands. He wondered if she was still awake, then felt stupid stop acting like a chick! He berated himself. All the same he couldn't stop himself writing her a text \"Goodnight\" He didn't send it. A/N phew! This chapter was so hard to write and I think it's the last time I'll tell anything from both their perspectives- expect the story to pick up the pace from here on out! P.S. I re-uploaded this chapter because I realised that Tommy goes to Iraq not Afghanistan so Helmand Province was completely wrong (silly me!)[Chapter 14] Disclaimer: I own nothing ALSO this chapter is a little graphic both in terms of blood and language (tbh if you watched the film I doubt an f-bomb here or there is gonna phase you but just so you know!) Chapter 14 February 13 th Rain poured down the sides of the bus as it stopped at the end of Oakland Avenue, Katrina steeled herself for the deluge before hopping off and running full-tilt for her building. The last of the snow was melting underfoot, compacted on the pavements into sheets of grimy ice. Katrina had to clutch onto a telephone pole to avoid sliding over as she rounded the corner. Jesus! She thought to her self, what a day! Developments at the studios had thankfully been less stormy and, as she turned her key in the lock Katrina thought she might just be in for a quiet, restful night. No tearful phone calls from Danni, no bitching about Lauren from Sonja or Mark who was having a rough time of it as Lauren's handsome prince. Just peace and quiet- bliss. The six days since the casting of the production had been some of the busiest in Katrina's memory. Endless classes and rehearsals and conditioning to get them ready for the opening night which, as everyone kept reminding her, was only a month away. Four weeks to make everything step, note and word perfect. Her evening conversations with Tommy were a welcome respite, the two neighbors met up almost every night for a drink. After the Irish coffee incident Tommy began letting her add her own whiskey when she came to his apartment but he still dragged her out for walks in the snow virtually without warning. Katrina smiled, her friends at work were getting increasingly suspicious every time her phone rang during the day- they all insisted that she was dating the brawny fighter. Katrina told them repeatedly that they were \"just friends\", trying to stress just how out of her league Tommy was but everyone remained uniformly unconvinced. Pushing open the door to her apartment she was greeted by the unwelcome sound of water dripping. A large puddle had formed on the living room floor and a damp patch on the ceiling told her that more water was yet to come. Sighing deeply, Katrina dumped her bag on the floor and went to fetch a bowl to put under the leak. Must be all this rain she thought. Knowing that she had a quiet evening to herself, Katrina took the time to do some of the things that usually got neglected. She had a long, hot bath with some of the bath salts that her friends in Chicago had given her as a leaving present- the lavender sent made her all sleepy and worked to relax some of the tight muscles in her legs and back. It was late by the time she got out, fingers and toes wrinkled by the water. She was just getting out he French manicure kit when she heard a knock on the front door. Katrina opened it, suddenly very aware that she was in pajama shorts and an old Joffrey Ballet t-shirt. On the other side of the door was Tommy, in a t-shirt and trackies looking mightily put out. \"Hi.\" \"Hey, come on in.\" Katrina said, leading the way into the kitchen. Tommy followed, Katrina noticed that his shoes were wet even though the rest of him was dry. \"So, Katy,\" he began suddenly, taking a seat at the kitchen table, \"my apartment's flooded, can I sleep on your couch tonight?\" \"Uhh, sure no problem, is everything soaked?\" she asked. \"Pretty much, gonna have to call the landlord tomorrow, dry the place out.\" \"Oh dear, do you want to go and rescue anything before it gets ruined, clothes, pictures?\" \"Nah, I think it's just the floor and all the furniture that's wet.\" \"That's okay then.\" Out of habit Katrina put the kettle on. \"Do you need a toothbrush, want to take a shower or anything?\" \"I brought my own-\" Tommy ruefully held a crumpled plastic bag. \"Always prepared- just like a boy scout.\" \"I weren't never a boy scout.\" Smiled Tommy. He'd unbent a bit over the last week, still loath to reveal any details about his past but quicker to laugh, less edgy. Katrina supposed he was a bit shy, and used to flamboyant \"theater-types\" she'd forgotten that some people take a while to get to know. After all, it wasn't as though she was exactly an open book about her childhood either- the pair of them were experts at avoiding the subject. \"It's kinda late for coffee, even for you and also I've run out so, how about some tea?\" Katrina asked, rooting around in her cupboards for the teabags. \"Tea? Uhhh, sure?\" Anyone would think she'd offered him arsenic. \"Cool.\" Katrina opened yet another cupboard in search of teabags, spotting them she cursed. They were on the top shelf. \"How did they get up there?\" she asked. Tommy rounded the bench to stand next to her. \"Need a hand?\" he asked and next moment he'd got his hands around her waist and picked her up. \" Kr-ist !\" Katrina squeaked, suddenly aware that she wasn't wearing any knickers. \"Got it?\" Tommy asked from somewhere beneath her, Katrina quickly grabbed the packet. \"Got it, thanks\" Blushing furiously Katrina bustled about getting mugs and milk. She saw Tommy smirk to himself as he returned to his seat. They got through the rest of the night with much less embarrassment then even Katrina could have hoped for. They didn't talk much, the sound of the driving rain on the windows soothed them both like a lullaby. They half watched some game show; not really paying attention. It was almost midnight when, after her fourth cup of tea, Katrina noticed how late it was. \"Do you mind helping me make up the couch?\" Tommy followed her with out a word to her improvised linen cupboard- more of a shelf if she was honest. \"You don't have to go to all the trouble.\" He said, gruffly. \"Don't even think about it, you're a guest- my momma taught me manners.\" \"That she did… What's she like? Must be missin' you out on them islands.\" \"Yeah, I guess so- but she's not alone out there, lots of friends, church… you know and I've been gone a long time. But what she's like? French.\" \"French?\" \" Oui - naturalized citizen when she married my dad, moved here with me when she was seventeen.\" \"That young?\" Katrina nodded, spreading out the sheets with Tommy's help. \"My dad went to France on holiday after collage, came back with a wife and a baby.\" \"Wow…\" Tommy thought for a moment before asking, \"where is he now?\" \"He died, pretty soon after I was born- Mom only stayed in the states because her parents wouldn't take her back, still don't talk to her, or me.\" Tommy frowned, \"twenty years later?\" \"Yup, you know how family can be.\" \"Yeah, that I do.\" Katrina yawned, dropping her edge of the blanket to cover her mouth with both hands. \"Sorry.\" \"Don't be, I'm keepin' you up. You should get some rest.\" \"Yeah, goodnight Tommy.\" \"G'night Katy, thanks for letting me crash here an' everythin'.\" \"What are friends for right?\" With that they parted ways, Katrina taking the tiny spiraling staircase to her bedroom and Tommy throwing himself down on the couch. In the total quiet all she could hear was Tommy shifting around to get comfortable and the drip of water from the leak in her ceiling. Drip drip drip. Katrina snuggled deeper under the covers. Drip drip drip, she felt her eyes closing. Drip drip- she was asleep before she knew it. February 14th Katrina woke, suddenly. Something was definitely not right her whole body tensed up, listening for noises in the dark. It was so pitch black that when she opened her eyes the gloom seemed to settle over them like a shroud. Then she heard it, a low moan and then again louder. Labored, rasping breathing turning to wrenching sobs. What was going on? She flipped on her bedside light and got up. Looking over the balcony from her bedroom she could just make Tommy on the couch below. He was thrashing like a madman, blankets tangled around his legs. Without thinking Katrina dashed down the steps and knelt by his side. She grasped his shoulders and shook him violently. \" Tommy wake up! \" she whispered. He jerked back, from her, wrenching himself out of her grasp. For a long moment he stared at her, breath coming in great, shuddering gasps. \" Manny? That you?\" he whispered, into the blackness. \"Tommy it's me Katrina, your neighbor.\" She reached out and touched his arm, he jerked back. \"Katrina?\" \"Yes. You're in my apartment remember.\" She could just see him nodding. \"I woke you up.\" He replied tonelessly. \"It's okay. Are you alright?\" Tommy nodded again, breathing easier now, he'd nearly stopped shaking. Katrina reached out, one hand finding his chest in the darkness, he was drenched in cold sweat. \"You're freezing.\" \"It's fine.\" He put a hand over hers. \"Go back to sleep.\" Tommy lay back down but didn't let go of her hand. She could see his eyes glinting in the darkness, still half wild with fear. His heart was beating unnaturally fast under her fingers. \"Move over.\" Katrina whispered, acting on instinct. Cautiously she climbed onto the couch next to Tommy, drawing the blanket over them both and laying her head on his shoulder. Tommy hesitated before wrapping his other arm around her. \"No more bad dreams, promise?\" she murmured. \"Promise.\" He whispered back. When she woke Katrina was instantly aware that Tommy not with her. She felt his absence beside her, the fading heat on his side of the couch. She sat up and saw him, sitting on the end of the couch head in his hands. She rubbed her eyes, they were itching with tiredness. \"Good morning\" she croaked. \"Mornin'\" Tommy grunted, standing up and walking to the door. \"Thought I should stick around least 'till you woke up. Tell you thanks for lettin' me crash here last night.\" Something in his voice put Katrina on edge \"Okay?\" She slid off the couch and padded across to join him near the door. \"Tommy, are you alright? What happened last night was pretty intense…\" Tommy's mouth tightened, \"I'm fine.\" \"Sure?\" He turned, making to leave. \"Who's Manny?\" She knew she shouldn't be asking this but wasn't prepared for his response. He turned back to her suddenly cold and expressionless, \" That is none of your damn business… got it?\" he stepped closer, suddenly towering over her. Katrina stood her ground, willing her knees not to shake. \"Why do you care anyway?\" he growled. Not waiting to hear an answer Tommy wrenched open the door and slammed it on his way out. Katrina couldn't stop her hands from shaking all the way in to work, trying to put her hair up into a bun she kept dropping all the pins until Sonja had to come over and rescue her. \"Katy are you okay?\" she asked, taking the hairnet that Katrina was twisting in her fingers. \"Yeah, I'm good, fine… yeah.\" \"Sure you are.\" Sonja carefully put up Katrina's hair, pinning in the loose ends and wrapping the hair-net over her bun with expert ease. \"Pointes? Or do you need me to tie those too?\" she asked, getting them out of Katrina's bag. \"I think I've got this one thanks.\" Katrina smiled gratefully at the red-head. Sonja's solicitous mood lasted all day, from cuing her in class when she spaced out to bringing her a salad in the lunch break when Katrina said she would really rather be alone for a bit. She even managed to keep from gushing about the pair of earrings Vlad had given her for Valentine's Day, all in the name of friendship. \"You're the best Soni you know that?\" Katrina said, taking the salad her friend passed her and tucking in immediately. \"Are you going to tell me what's got you all screwed up?\" Sonja asked, helping herself to a little chicken Ceaser. \"Boy, well, man trouble.\" \"Trouble in paradise?\" Sonja was instantly all ears. \"What paradise? We're just friends, well, we were friends I don't know about that now.\" \"What happened?\" Katrina filled her in on the action of the evening, Tommy coming by because his apartment flooded, watching TV, and then the terrifying nightmares. By the time she'd finished her friend's eyes were the size of dinner plates. \"And then he just yelled at you and stormed off?\" \"Pretty much.\" \"Bastard.\" \"I think he's been through a lot... some… family troubles or something…\" \"You're making excuses for him?\" \"Okay I'll stop.\" Said Katrina quickly. \"Push over. Look, every great guy comes with some baggage… in your case lots of baggage. You have to decide it he's worth the extra-effort. Katrina thought for a moment, munching on some lettuce, \"Ninety nine percent of the time he's great, quiet but funny, very sweet you know? I would miss him if he wasn't around and I fancy him like crazy … but this... this really scared me, maybe too much.\" \"Well, I'm sure you'll find out how much is too much soon enough.\" This troubling prophecy rolled around in Katrina's mind all through rehearsal like a marble in a tilt-a-whirl. She should have never gotten this involved in the first place, letting a virtual stranger invade her thoughts and feelings. She didn't know whether she was angrier with herself or with him. She danced harder, throwing her body around the stage with renewed animation. There were still three hours left of rehearsal maybe if she danced hard enough he would be gone like some sort of exorcism. She leapt into the air, twisting before landing cat-like at center stage. If only she could leap free of her feelings so easily. I wish I'd never met him in the first place she thought, pirouetting. No you don't her inner voice chided. Why is everything with him so complicated? She wondered, throwing her body to the ground to end the sequence, her hip hit the floor with a crack that effectively ended any more inner monologue. Things went sharply down hill. Katrina was on her last pair of pointe shoes for the day, they were already wearing out a little, the hardened soles starting to give way, increasing the pressure on her toes. She raised her self up, wincing slightly but they would have to do. Going to her last class, conditioning, as fate would have it, she noticed a tight knot of gossiping dancers congregated outside the studio doors. Getting closer Katrina could see that Daniel Kline was in the studio, the man still caused a stir wherever he went. He was seated at a small table at the far end of the room in deep conversation with Madame B, a stack of files balanced between them. \"What's going on?\" Katrina whispered to Sonja who had appeared at her elbow. \"Contracts.\" Said Sonja, voice quavering slightly. \"What?\" \"He likes to bring them out sometimes to let us know that were all under review- everyone's replaceable .\" \"But my contract doesn't come up for renewal until next year.\" Said Katrina, uncomprehendingly. \"Doesn't matter, he's fired lots of people mid-contract says he'll ruin any dancer's reputation if they try to sue, so it's never contested.\" \"Just like that?\" \" Gone. \" Sonja replied in grave tones. They filed in, all the dancers unnaturally subdued. Katrina tested her pointes a few more times with trepidation, not at all sure they would get her through the class. Daniel still hadn't come up with that allowance money, she wished he'd hurry up. They started to train, the music, now familiar flowed through Katrina like water. Over and over she raised herself up onto pointe and twirled and twisted, was picked up or dragged down. Thoughts of Tommy slamming his way out of her flat receded as she finally lost herself to the movement. The studio was heating up, sweat gleaming on the skin of the dancers as they pushed their bodies with desperation under the ever present beat of the music and the barking of Madame B's voice. Then, Katrina felt it. Crunch . The pain shot like white lightning from her toes right up into her legs making her knees buckle. She knelt, pressing her hands to her mouth to stop herself from screaming out loud. The beat of the music now making her teeth chatter she dragged herself over to the wall at the back and propped herself against it. Pulling off her shoes she saw blood seeping through her tights, she shuddered. Dragging herself up to standing she slipped out of the doors to her left and headed for the dressing room. Footsteps behind her should have warned her of someone coming but at the touch of a man's hand on her arm she yelped turning to face any would-be attacker. It was the director, Daniel Kline, looking immaculate in pewter-grey suit, dark hair slicked back from his predatory face. \"Something the matter?\" he asked, not taking his hand off her arm. \"Umm, I think I might have broken a toe in there…\" Katrina mumbled, gesturing to her stockinged feet, which were leaving stains on the concrete. \"Will you be coming in tomorrow?\" Daniel asked. \"I guess so?\" \"Your contract is up for review you know- you do want this job don't you?\" \"Yes absolutely.\" \"And you'd do anything to keep it?\" His thick fingers hand found purchase on her arm now. She nodded, not trusting herself to speak. Daniel lent down until his lips just brushed her ear, \"Anything?\" \"No.\" Karina suppressed a shiver but Daniel just smiled genially, letting her go and backing off a few paces, all charm again. \"You should think about it, not so easy to find a new job these days.\" He called over his shoulder. Down in the changing rooms Katrina peeled off her tights and saw the damage, it was a few moments before the tears started but once they did, she couldn't stop. Katrina traipsed up the street, coordination all but lost to her tiredness. The lights of the apartment block seemed to be getting father away rather than closer as she walked. She groaned softly and sped up, pulling her jacket tighter around her shoulders as the cold started to bite. She'd just reached the doors and was pulling them open when a large figure loomed out of the darkness, she leapt back with a yelp. \"Hey calm down.\" Tommy murmured, stepping into the light with his hands up. \"Just me.\" Katrina stared at him silently for a moment, heart still hammering. \"Hi.\" She muttered, going for the door again. Tommy was too quick for her, opening the door and standing back to let her in. They stood face to face for a moment in the entry hall, Katrina was vividly aware that she must look terrible in the unflattering strip-lighting. She was sure her eyes were still red with crying and her cheeks blotchy. Unfortunately she was absolutely right. \"You okay?\" asked Tommy after a moment, ducking his head to look her in the eyes. Katrina avoided his gaze, tightening her jaw to keep back the tears that threatened to spill again. \"I'm fine.\" She forced out trying to walk past him to the lift. Tommy watched her go and then hurried to catch up, his longer legs covering the ground much more quickly than hers. \"I'm coming with you.\" He said, his tone brooking no room for argument. He led her out of the lift, taking her bag and slinging it over his broad shoulder. \"Thanks\" Katrina said quietly. \"S'okay\" Once inside Tommy lead her into the kitchen, the couch where they'd slept last night was still made up, the sheets rumpled. The pain in her feet and ankles was starting the burn as she took a seat at the counter. Tommy filled up a glass of water and pushed it towards her. \"You're limping.\" He said, coming around the bench to sit next to her. \"Probably.\" Replied Katrina, still not looking at him. \"Come on, shoes off.\" \"What?\" she asked, alarmed. \"Come on.\" Tommy left her, going back to the sink where he filled up a large bowl with water. \"No way, my feet are a mess.\" She protested. \"Don't argue.\" Replied Tommy, fixing her with another no nonsense look. Katrina stared at him for a moment before slipping off her sneakers. \"Shit.\" She hissed in pain, her socks were now sticky with blood. She tried peeling them off and felt the broken parts of her toenails pulling out of the nail beds. She felt the room sway a little. All of a sudden Tommy was back by her side. \" Fuck \" he hissed under his breath, lowering the bowl to the floor, \"we'll soak 'em off.\" He said, gently guiding her feet into the water, which was mercifully warm. Katrina felt herself shudder all over as the water touched her skin, it burned a little but not more than she could stand. They sat in silence for a moment before Katrina realized that Tommy was staring at her. \"You wanna tell me what happened today?\" he asked in his low gravely voice. \" Ballet happened. Its not as glamorous as it looks.\" She attempted a smile. \"Your coach know this is happening?\" he asked. Katrina nodded, \"It's normal.\" Tommy's expression darkened. \"Were you cryin'?\" he asked suddenly. Katrina hesitated a moment before nodding again, miserably. \"'Bout this?\" he pressed. \"It's just been a tough day at the studios- lots of pressure, everyone's stressing.\" Tommy nodded before kneeling down and gently taking her feet out of the water. Katrina was struck by the intimacy of this gesture; the Bible passage about the immoral woman washing Jesus's feet came to her mind. All your sins are forgiven Tommy she thought, the pain forcing her mind to wander. Tommy's voice brought her back through the fog. \"What happened?\" he was asking, now peeling her socks very carefully over her toes. Katrina got the feeling he wasn't talking about her injuries. \"My boss- Daniel, dropped the bombshell that my contract is up for review and that he could fire me any time he wants...\" She sighed, Tommy waited for her to continue, \"He got a bit umm…\" she broke off the push her hair of her face, \"physical… I told him no but I want to- have to, keep my job.\" Tommy's eyes hardened as he looked up at her, his grip on her ankles tightening. He nodded, his normally full lips disappearing into a tight line, Katrina saw the anger in his face and all of a sudden wished he wasn't holding on so tight to her legs. He looked at her sharply, \"Do you want me to talk to him?\" \"Talk?\" Tommy shrugged in a non-committal way. \"I don't want you to go to jail.\" \"Thanks.\" He set her feet back into the water and stood. \"You sure about that?\" \"Sure. I'm a big girl, can handle my own drama.\" \"Shouldn't have to.\" He said quietly, he turned and dug around in a cupboard under the sink returning a minute later with a first aid kit. Silently he knelt down and with a care and dexterity that surprised Katrina began to bandage up her feet. \"You gotta take better care of yourself,\" he said. \"Yes doctor.\" Katrina replied, she reached down, running a hand over his hair, \"hey,\" he looked up, \"thanks for this, you don't have to do it you know.\" He shook his head, \"least I can do to apologize.\" They sat in silence for a while, Tommy quietly finished his bandaging and emptied the bloodied bowl of water back into the sink. He threw himself onto a stool across from her with a sigh. \"Tommy.\" Katrina felt this had gone on long enough. \"What's going on with you? Like last night, this morning, what was that all about?\" \"It's nothin'\" Tommy muttered, suddenly very interested in paint chipping off the bench. Katrina forced herself to continue, if she stopped now she would loose her nerve. \"It was a lot of things, but nothing wasn't one of them.\" Tommy said nothing, continuing to chip away at the paint until Katrina put a hand over his. He tensed up, glaring at her but she didn't let go. \"What's it to you? You don't know me.\" The anger of the morning was back in his voice. \"I want to know you Tommy, that's why I'm asking. I care about you, okay?\" There was a long, tense pause before Tommy stood up and began to pace, running his hands through his dark hair distractedly. All of a sudden he started speaking, all in a rush as though the words had been waiting years to come out. \"It was in Iraq, my second tour. We were out on patrol, the whole unit, Manny, and me. Just routine, nothing going on...\" He threw himself back onto the stool for a moment before standing again. Katrina stayed quiet, waiting for him to continue. \"Then we see the planes overhead, American jets so we got out our flags, started waving 'em.\" He sat down again, all the fight going out of him. \"When the bombs started falling I couldn't move, couldn't do nothin', the guy next to me was blown to bits but I couldn't run… Manny started pushing me in front of him, getting me to run. I fell, he pulled me up. He was behind me the whole time until the last bomb.\" Tommy drew in a great shuddering breath before continuing. \"When I woke up he was in the bomb crater, all burned up, no legs, but he was still alive…screaming' for his wife… and I…\" Tommy swallowed, shaking his head as though to get water out of his ears. Katrina could see that he couldn't continue. She slipped off her stool and put her arms around his neck. He tensed for a moment, unused to this sort of gentleness before wrapping an arm around her waist. She could feel him shaking all over, as if something inside him was breaking. She rubbed circles on his back, trying to soothe him, his arms tightened around her, their bodies fitting together like puzzle pieces. Eventually his breathing returned to normal, the grip of the memories loosening its hold. \"You should sit.\" He said finally, scooping Katrina up and carrying her bridal style to the couch. They settled down, half sitting, half lying, arms around each other. \"He saved my life\" Tommy said finally, his voice barely more than a rumble. \"Paid for it with his own.\" \"Hey, that's not your fault.\" Katrina knew that saying this wasn't going to convince him, but she had to try. \"I'm sorry\" Tommy mumbled, cheek resting on top of her head. \"What about?\" she asked. \"Bout everythin', being' a jerk to you this mornin', worse than a jerk. For actin' like a fuckin' baby right now… everythin'.\" he sighed. Katrina turned to face him, putting a hand on either side of his face; she wanted him to listen to her, to understand. \"Tommy. You've been through a lot, seen way more than anyone should, and I know it's been hard on you just don't apologize for it. Okay? You don't have to carry everything by yourself- if you don't want to. But you can't take it out on me either, we clear?\" Tommy nodded jerkily, his dark blue eyes never leaving hers. Before she could catch her breath he'd wrapped both arms around her waist and dragged her into him. His lips were so soft that Katrina didn't mind how roughly they were kissing. She slid her hands into his hair, drawing herself closer to him. Kissing Tommy was like drowning, Katrina's every sense was full of him. The way he felt under her hands, hard muscle and warm skin, his heart beating so hard she could feel it through his chest and right into hers. The way he smelled, clean and smoky like cigarettes and the gym, his lips were so warm against hers. She didn't realize she'd been holding her breath until she had to pull away gasping for air. Tommy tightened his arms around her as she drew back, only allowing her the briefest gasp before they were welded together tighter than before. His warm hands roamed over her back and down to her ass before scooping her up so she was sitting on his lap. She pulled away again, pressing her hands against his chest to push him back a little bit. He barely budged but seemed to get the message. \"Tommy,\" \"mmm?\" he smiled at her, respectfully moving his hands from her butt to her waist. \"What are we doing?\" she asked, it seemed important to know before his lips tempted her back again. \"Kissin'.\" Said Tommy simply, he stroked her cheek with one callused thumb. \"You're shaking.\" \"It's been a while.\" she admitted dropping her eyes. \"Hey,\" Tommy slipped his thumb under her chin, lifting her face back up to meet his for a kiss. \"It's okay.\" After that nothing else seemed important. A/N- Love it? Hate it? let me know![Chapter 15] Chapter 15 February 15 \"Good job Tommy, now give me eight-\" Frank held up his mitts and let Tommy strike eight against them. \"Nice work today.\" He said clapping the panting fighter on the shoulder. Tommy nodded at him, a weary smile on his face before turning and heading towards the showers. Tommy turned the shower up to full heat and let the water sooth his aching muscles. It was no use, the tension wouldn't go away no matter how hard he trained in the gym or how hot the water had called that morning, leaving him a long messages about picking Tommy up from the gym and them going to see Pop. Apparently Brendan had found him a live-in program to help him sober up. Tommy felt in hindsight as though he should have been the one to help their dad out, since it was mostly his fault that the old man was back on the bottle again. The ever-present guilt about his words and actions towards his father gnawed at his gut yet again. He sighed, shutting off the water and reaching for a towel. Brendan was waiting for him in Frank's office by the time Tommy was finished getting dressed. He could see the two of them through the window, laughing about something. Tommy dug his hands deeper into the pockets of his jacket and caught his brother's eye. Brendan quickly said goodbye to Frank and hurried out of the office. \"Hey Tommy, how you been?\" he asked, pulling Tommy into a one armed hug. Tommy awkwardly clapped him on the back \"s'been okay, trainin' hard.\" \"Frank treatin' you alright?\" asked Brendan, leading Tommy out to the car and throwing his bag on the backseat. \"Yeah, yeah, he's a good guy- and a good trainer.\" \"He definitely is,\" agreed Brendan. The pair didn't talk much on the way to Pop's house. Tommy knew that the tension from seeing their father again was making him uptight but he couldn't manage to break the silence. All of a sudden he wished Katrina was there, she always seemed to know when he needed her to talk because he couldn't or when he needed someone to listen. He felt himself smiling involuntarily at the memory of Monday night- kissing her on and on until she was breathless. They'd lain together on the couch, the TV on low and she'd fallen asleep in his arms like she was always meant to be there. \"What are you smiling about?\" asked Brendan, his voice bringing Tommy back to the present. \"Nothin'\" he grunted. \"Sure its nothin'… I know that look.\" \"What look?\" \"That sappy look when you got a crush on a girl.\" \"What am I, thirteen?\" \"You'll always be thirteen to me Tommy.\" Tommy snorted in disgust and went back to staring back out the window. \"What's her name?\" Brendan pressed. Tommy considered telling him to mind his own, but he'd have to tell Brendan sometime if he ever planned on taking Katrina home with him as he fully intended to do. \"Katrina, she's my neighbor.\" \"Girl next door?\" \"Pretty much.\" \"And?\" \"God Bren, I swear if you were any more of a gossip you'd turn into a chick .\" Brendan just grinned, \"I guess we'll be meeting her soon then.\" To that Tommy had no answer. By the time they pulled up at Pop's front door it had started to rain, heavy drops of water pummeling the car and soaking through Tommy's t-shirt in seconds as both brothers ran to the door. They stood shivering on the front porch before Tommy squared his shoulders and knocked three times on the front door. For a long moment there was no answer but they could hear the shuffling of feet as someone approached. The door creaked open and Tommy could see his father's face on the other side. He was struck again by the contrast between the man who had trained him for Sparta and the man before him today. \"Whad'ya want?\" the old man asked, voice slightly slurred with drink. \"Can we come in?\" asked Brendan. The door was thrown open and they followed Paddy's retreating back into the kitchen. The house was in an even worse state than when they'd last visited. Persistent damp was starting to stain through the wallpaper and leave dark patches on the ceiling. The kitchen its self was cluttered with unwashed dishes and trash, old whiskey and wine bottles were huddled around the dustbin. The smell was terrible, stale alcohol mixing with old take-out. Brendan coughed, \"Pop, what's going on here?\" \"Nothin' much son,\" their father replied, \"why'd you come to visit your old man after all this time?\" The brothers looked at each other uneasily, neither knowing quite how to breach the subject. Tommy shifted from foot to foot before beginning, \"We were thinkin' you might need a little help Pop.\" \"Help? What kinda help?\" the old man grumbled, taking down a bottle of Johnny Walker and pouring a generous amount into a mug. He offered it to both sons, each of whom refused. Privately Tommy though he could have used a drink right about now. \"Well y'know Pop, maybe to help you get this place cleaned up a bit, cut back on the liquor…\" Brendan tried to explain. Their father rounded on them brandishing the bottle, \"I don' need no help of any kind- s'pecially not from you .\" He clumped off towards the living room, the boys followed. They sat in silence, words unsaid echoing in their ears the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece the only sound in the room. \"How 'bout if Pop?\" asked Tommy, feeling he should at least back Brendan up. \"How 'bout what?\" \"Gettin' sober- you had almost a thousand days last time I was here-\" Paddy laughed darkly and poured himself another shot of whiskey. \"A thousand days eh? And what good did it do me? One thousand days of apologizin' for what I done to you boys growin' up. One thousand days of tryin' to be a different man, a better father. I give up- you've got no use for me now nowa days.\" He sighed and lapsed into silence. \"Heard you got a new trainer Tommy, you thinkin' of fightin' again?\" Tommy nodded. \"I'm gonna be tryin out of Sparta again.\" \"That's my boy- never gives up…Theogenes\" Paddy smiled vaguely, eyes starting to drift shut. The pride Tommy felt at his father's praise, a remnant of the times when his father had coached him almost all the way to the Olympics faired in Tommy's chest, quickly turning to ash. \"You want to see me fight again Pop?\" his father nodded, eyes closed now, he seemed almost asleep. \"Go back on the program then- sober up and we can talk.\" \"Why.\" Paddy asked, his voice no more than a rumble, \"I thought you liked me better as a drunk?\" and he was asleep. Tommy sat back in his seat with a deep sigh, \" Fuck .\" \"Yeah.\" Agreed Brendan standing up and draping a blanket over their father. Tommy rested his head on the palm of his hands, he really just wanted to go to sleep or go for a long run, anything to take his mind off the situation right in front of him. He could feel Brendan's interested gaze on his back, no doubt wondering what their father had meant about liking him better as a drunk. All of a sudden Tommy just didn't want to deal with it. He rose and strode into the kitchen. Gathering up all the old drink bottles he threw them into a bin-bag and lugged the whole thing outside chucking it with a crash into the front lawn. Then he ran a skink full of hot water and began to wash the piles of dirty cups and plates that were in the skink. The water scalded his hands but he couldn't bring himself to care, a little bit of pain always cleared his head anyway. It was a moment before he realized that Brendan was standing by his side drying up the plates. \"So, what are we gonna do?\" Brendan asked finally. \"Dunno… but he's going to that clinic whether he wants to or not.\" \"He better, I already booked him a place.\" \"You did?\" Tommy looked over at him, surprised. \"Yeah- \" \"Without tellin' me?\" \"I had to make a start with the paper work Tommy, its no big deal.\" \"At least let me pay you half for the deposit.\" Brendan waved him away, \"You don't need to do that Tommy, I got this.\" \"No I should be the one payin' for this- it ain't your fault the old man's back on the sauce.\" \"Ain't your fault neither-\" protested Brendan. \"Yes it is.\" Tommy twisted off the faucet and stalked off back into the living room, throwing himself down on the couch Brendan followed, taking the easy chair opposite. \"What do you mean Tommy?\" Brendan asked after the silence stretched to breaking point. Tommy didn't reply but got up and started to pace, anger knotting the muscles down his spine. The tinderbox of anger he always harbored towards his father had found a spark to light it. \"All of this is about me and Pop, not you. You never got involved in the past and y'shouldn't try now. I know why you're tryin' to help but payin' for Pop's treatment ain't gonna undo what you did Bren.\" He ground out, he was too angry now to admit to his own shortcomings, it was easier to take it out on Brendan. Brendan leapt to his feet, \"What are you talking about?\" Tommy stopped pacing a rounded on his brother, \"I'm talkin' about you abandoning us, me and Ma, we needed you then not now. Throwin' your cash around ain't gonna bring her back.\" He growled. Brendan's jaw clenched in anger as he stepped into the path of Tommy's pacing. \"Fuck you Tommy, I didn't even know she was sick! You kept it from me- that was not your decision to make.\" \"Yes it was, I was there- you chose the old man over us.\" \"And what about Tess?\" The two brothers stood toe-to-toe glowering at each other. \"What about 'er?\" Tommy respected and liked Tess too much to say anything against her- try as he might he couldn't resent her for her part in his brother's abandonment. He dropped his gaze heaving a deep sigh. \"Tommy you know I only stayed for Tess, that was the only reason, I love her you can understand that, can't you?\" Tommy nodded grimly, sitting back down on the couch. \"I'm sorry. I shoulda called you, said something.\" He muttered. \"S'okay- I shoulda told you I wasn't comin' along… shoulda told you I booked Pop into this rehab place.\" \"I'm still paying half of that y'know.\" \"How about you owe me?\" Tommy raised an eyebrow. \"After your first fight you'll get sponsors and then you can pay me back when you have the money.\" \"Alright- until I have the money…\" Tommy nodded in agreement. They both jumped as a voiced croaked from the corner. \"What's this rehab you've gone and put me in?\" Brendan clenched and unclenched his fists before turning and facing their father who, befuddled by drink was looking surprised to see them. \"Whadda you doin' in my house?\" he rasped, hand already groping for the bottle beside the chair, Brendan snatched it up. \"We're here to get you into a program Pop- for the drinking.\" Their father's face darkened with rage but Brendan held up a hand to stem the torrent of abuse coming his way. \"We mean it Pop, its either this or we call APS and have them take you.\" All the red drained out of Paddy's face, leaving it an ugly ashen, puce. \"Y'woudn't. My own boys?\" His voice turned pleading but Brendan was unmoved, he nodded grimly. \"We'll come by tomorrow to pick you up- three o'clock?\" Paddy couldn't do anything but sit in shock, gaping at the two of them. Tommy rose from the sofa, padding across the living room. It was strange to him- seeing Brendan and Pop together, the icy hatred Brendan held for their father was really the only ugly side Brendan had, but Pop did have a way of bringing out the worst in everyone. \"You alright with that Pop?\" he asked quietly, crouching down so he wouldn't tower over the old man. Tommy would later reflect that where their father was concerned, he and Brendan switched roles, Brendan was the angry messed up one and Tommy had to walk in his brother's peace-keeping shoes for a mile or two. He was sure the experience probably did him a world of good. \"Alright?\" Pop asked gazing blearily up into the concerned face of his youngest son, \"You're sending me away… my own boys…\" he trailed off muttering incoherently. \"It's not far Pop and then you can move back here again- when you've dried out.\" \"Well I'll be the driest old drunk they ever saw then,\" mumbled Pop, eyes starting to close. Tommy hiked the blanket higher over his father's chest and stood, glad to get away. Brendan was already waiting at the door to go. \"I can't stand this place.\" He admitted as the pair walked to the car. \"I can see that.\" replied Tommy, \"you're hard on him you know- I know the old man deserves it but-\" Tommy broke off, catching Brendan staring at him. \"Since when did you care about Pop?\" his brother asked bitterly. \"Since when did you?\" Tommy said goodbye to Brendan in front of the red-brick apartment buildings. The streetlights were already on, turning the last of the dirty snow bright orange in the half-light. It was a quick goodbye- Tommy knew that Brendan was eager to get back to Tess and the girls, might still be angry about the fight they had earlier and was definitely still angry at Pop. He watched his brother drive away before climbing the stairs up to his apartment. The place was still slightly damp- maintenance had done a good job draining the floodwater after the storm but the job wasn't done yet. Tommy was still sleeping on the couch until his mattress dried out. He changed quickly into a pair of worn sweats and collapsed on the couch with a deep sigh, he didn't think he could take many more days like today, dealing with Pop really took it out of him. It was like re-opening an old wound and rubbing salt into it. He suspected it was much worse for Brendan who'd so long tried to cut himself of from their father for reasons Tommy wasn't quite sure of, the pair hadn't spoken much about life after Tommy and their mother left Pittsburgh but from what Brendan had told him it had been rough. All the same, Pop was getting old, his shouting and drinking days were behind him. I must be getting soft if I'm sticking up for the old man he thought. He flicked on the TV, scrolling past the news and old western movies that were always on this time of night, finally settling on the highlights of a Formula One race from earlier in the evening. As he watched the cars whizzing around the track his mind wandered back to last night when he and Katrina had done much more interesting things on her couch. He smiled remembering how her lithe body felt under his hands, how she shivered all over with nerves and excitement. It was like kissing a livewire; she was so much stronger than she looked, and so in the moment her hands wandering over his back and under his shirt, her back arching to bring their bodies closer together. They'd only kissed last night, Tommy hadn't made-out with a girl since high school and he'd started to worry seriously about the possibility of blue-balls, but he knew that this was different. He was different around her, in only a few weeks Katrina knew more about him than almost anyone else in the world, even Bren in some ways. He'd told her more about Manny's death then he'd told even Pilar, then he could ever tell anyone else. That was what made the difference- Katrina knew his secrets and he couldn't hide behind the hard and indifferent mask that he showed to the rest of the world, the girl was officially under his skin, but Tommy couldn't find it in him to care. Christ you really are getting soft he thought to himself. Katrina had eventually fallen asleep in his arms; knocked out by the two painkillers he'd made her take. Her tiny, warm body curling into his like a kitten, and he'd wrapped his arms around her. He smiled remembering how her long eyelashes cast shadows on her cheeks. His arms felt empty with out her when he'd finally set her down and left her to sleep, they still felt empty now. You've got it bad he thought, maybe it's not too late to go and see her? Tommy checked his phone for the time, not having a watch. It was ten thirty. Katrina's probably still awake , that he knew what time his neighbor usually went to sleep was slightly alarming, maybe he could just swing by and see how she was doing? Tommy quickly quashed this idea, hauling himself off the couch and cricking his neck, he should let her sleep especially that injury she'd been carrying last night. He felt a sick squeeze in his stomach as the memory of Katrina's battered feet flashed through his mind; he'd never minded blood before but about seeing her bleed didn't sit well with him at all. At least with fighting the risks were pretty obvious, Tommy had never thought of ballet as dangerous before but now he guessed it was. It was different, Tommy thought to himself, seeing big guys like Rampage Jackson or Mad Dog Grimes, even his own brother getting beat up, and carried out of the ring, they were meant for that, tough enough to take a beating. Katy was plenty tough herself though, mused Tommy, hard as nails in her own sweet way, even so, seeing her hurt had affected him, more than he'd expected. A/N oh my goodness that was a doozie- writer's block is kicking my ass right now! Sorry about the wait- hopefully things will get quicker from here (promises promises…) I read and edited this chapter until I thought I was going crazy last night so please let me know if its cr*p! Thanks to LeavesofYanara for pointing out a mistake! xxx[Chapter 16] Disclaimer: I own nothing Chapter 16 February 16 th Katrina woke up and stretched, wincing, the muscles in her back and legs were cramped beyond belief. It was a moment before she realized that she was curled up in an armchair in her tiny living room. Bonjour Tristesse was lying on the floor at her feet; she must have drifted off reading. The last twenty-four hours had been a blur of classes, drama, and rehearsals. Just thinking about it made Katrina's head ache. However, today, she decided, would be different. Today everything was going to absolutely to plan; she might even get up the courage to go around to Tommy's flat. Probably not. The pair hadn't spoken since Monday night when they'd lain for hours tangled together and kissing on her sofa. Every time Katrina looked at it the memory of Tommy's touch ran over her skin once again. The man himself however hadn't been in contact. Typical guy move , she thought, sitting up and cricking her neck. She decided to put Tommy out of her mind, something she'd been deciding almost every day since she'd met him. I mean it this time , she vowed to herself, no more crushing on this guy like a little girl , you are an adult and a strong woman Katrina May Christiansen and you will act like one. Lecture to herself over, Katrina set about getting ready for the day. It was going to be a long one- Lacy had announced that their little dance troupe had another job which was just as well as Daniel their director was still stalking the halls with their contracts under his arm. This was a sure sign, Sonja assured her, that someone was for the chop. That conversation was in fact the cause of Katrina's late night- comforting a sobbing Danni on the phone until two in the morning. Sonja, Mark and even Vlad who was notoriously softhearted, had all been screening Danni's calls for this exact reason. Katrina wandered into work almost an hour early and idly painted her nails while she waited for the others to arrive, trying to clear her head. She kept having to stop herself from checking her phone, wondering if Tommy might have sent her a text or left a voicemail, he hadn't even left her a note but she was much too proud to call. She knew the way with men like Tommy was patience; he'd been through a lot- physically and emotionally and was only just starting to heal. If what had happened between them had felt intense to her, it must have been a hundred times worse for him Still, her own heart was feeling distinctly bruised. The soloists began to fill up the locker room chattering about the latest gossip from the upcoming production- most of them were in a tizzy because a group builders were coming in to the studios to get started on the set. Katrina heaved a sigh, sliding in one last bobby pin and standing up. \"Ready?\" asked Sonja who was engrossed in the latest edition of Vogue. \"Ready.\" Replied Katrina, glancing back at her cell one last time- the blank screen mocking her. Put him out of your mind, remember? She thought to herself. She forced herself to focus in class, allow the rhythm of the music to transport and carry her- no need to think. For her, this was the real magic of dance, completely emptying your mind of everything except the dance and the steps, while the music was playing nothing else mattered. Unfortunately the machine-gun-fire of Madame B's voice was totally ruining her vibe today. The woman was in a particularly foul mood, screeching at two of the male dancers when they talked at the barre and driving the poor pianist to his wit's end by demanding the same sections of the music be played over and over until every dancer completed the exercise perfectly. On days like this Katrina usually made sure to stay well out of her way, hugging the back wall and keeping her head down. Somehow however, the movement of the crowd pushed her to the front like penguins huddling for warmth. Crap , she thought as the music for a particularly challenging exercise clanged through the studio, she was right in the front and in the firing line. Squaring her shoulder she launched into the pattern. By some God-sent miracle Madame B's eyes glanced straight over her into the third row where she picked out some unfortunate girl and made her do the whole thing over on her own. Katrina vowed to go to mass on Sunday if she could keep up this run of luck. \"Katy!\" Katrina looked up from where she sat undoing her pointe shoes, her toes were still swaddled in two layers of bandages but she could never seem to get them on as well as Tommy had. \"What's up?\" she asked, looking around for who had called her, the soloist's changing room was packed to bursting just before lunch hour with loudly chattering girls. \"Katy!\" Sonja squeezed onto the bench beside her and presented her with her phone. \"You've got a missed call.\" She smirked as Katrina snatched up the phone and pressed re-dial. It went to Tommy's voicemail so she hung up with a sigh. \"Who was it?\" asked Sonja. \"Tommy.\" Replied Katrina, feeling she should at least tell someone. \"Tommy, the fighter?\" Katrina nodded, not able to stop the smile that came to her lips. Sonja gasped, \"Katy why didn't you tell me something happened? I want to know everything!\" It was sometimes hard to believe that Sonja was twenty-four years old. \"Okay, things happened on Monday night.\" Admitted Katrina with a wider smile, \"It was… beyond amazing.\" \"And you waited a whole day to tell me?\" Sonja's eyebrows shot into her hairline. \"I'm sorry, it was just so… intense- I guess I just needed some time to process everything.\" Sonja nodded understandingly, \"Has he redeemed himself for being a jerk then?\" \"Oh yes, absolutely. We talked and sort of started to unpack the baggage.\" \"Thattagirl.\" Katrina was glad that Sonja didn't want to know what sort of things came to light during that conversation. Sonja and Danni spent the rest of the walk to the dancer's favorite greasy spoon café pestering Katrina for details about her \"raunchy night\". She'd eventually had to disappoint them by telling them that she and Tommy were only on \"first base\", sometimes Katrina longed for \"grown up\" conversation. It started to rain, tiny droplets darkening the pavement, the heavy black clouds obscuring the sun plunging them all into an artificial dusk. The dancers settled into their favorite booth at the back of the café, the rumble of trucks outside making the cutlery shake on the table. Vlad and Mark were sitting with their heads together having an deep \"guy talk\" about their fantasy football leagues from last season which left Katrina at the mercy of Danni and Sonja. Thankfully her friends had stopped interrogating her inquisition-style and had moved on to speculating about the next show they were putting on with Lacy and the others. They were saying something about a football stadium getting new uniforms to match the team they were supporting- Katrina wasn't really paying attention. She was sitting closest to the aisle and took a moment to gaze out over the sea of people crowded into the small café for lunch. Most of them were men from the steelworks a few streets away, marked out by their thick, slightly singed work coats. There were always a few older men at the bar who never seemed to leave, they were the ones who nursed a pint all day and knew the bar man by name. As she looked over the sea of bent heads and broad backs one group of men stood up from their table, getting ready to leave. Three of these men were unusually tall and hulking, they seemed to be laughing about something- clapping each other on the back. The fourth man stood slightly apart from them shrugging on a thick jacket and pulling up his hood in preparation for the rain outside. He had his back to her but Katrina would have known him anywhere, the unaffected slouch with his hands in his pockets and his hood up. Tommy . \"You okay Katy, you look a million miles away?\" asked Danni. \"Yeah, yeah I'm fine…\" she glanced back up to where Tommy was standing. He turned slightly as though he could feel her gaze on his back, his eyes landed on hers. He immediately started over, weaving quickly through the throngs of people at the bar. \"Who's that?\" asked Sonja, following her gaze, then, before Katrina had time to answer comprehension dawned on he face. \"Its Tommy isn't it?\" Katrina only had time to nod before he was at her side. Tommy had taken his hood off, his dark hair sticking up at angles, she itched to smooth it down. He was shifting nervously from foot to foot, shoulders hunched and hands in his pockets. \"Hey.\" He started. \"Hey… umm, these are my fiends- Sonja, Danni, Mark, Vlad.\" Tommy tensely nodded at them not smiling. \"Do you wanna go outside?\" he asked his eyes never leaving her face. Katrina looked out of the window- it was raining more heavily now. \"Uh, sure.\" Standing outside the restaurant, Katrina turned to face Tommy, pulling her jacket tighter around her shoulders. \"You feelin' better today?\" he asked. \"What?\" \"Your feet.\" \"Oh, yeah, well no, not really but it'll get better with time.\" \"You work too hard.\" \"So do you.\" Katrina's eyes strayed to a fresh bruise forming across Tommy's cheekbone. \"I thought you were just sparring in the gym.\" Tommy shrugged, \"It's a violent sport, people get hurt.\" \"Yeah. I guess.\" \"Katy.\" Tommy stepped closer to her, close enough that she could feel the warmth rolling off him. \"I'm sorry I didn't call you earlier… had some stuff to do with Bren an' Pop.\" \"It's okay.\" \"No it ain't\" he insisted, \"at least let me make it up to you.\" Katrina had to smile at that, \"And how do you plan on doing that?\" she asked. \"Take you out to dinner.\" Tommy replied, \"This weekend, we'll go somewhere real nice- you pick.\" He looked hopefully down at her. \"Okay, I'd love to.\" Tommy relaxed visibly, his full lips arching into a smile. Before Katrina had time to think he'd pulled her into a deep kiss. Her arms instinctively went around Tommy's neck, her body pressed flush against his. Tommy's warm hands found her hips and drew her even closer. Far too soon, they broke apart for air and Katrina could see all their friends faces pressed, grinning to the window. \"Looks like we got an audience.\" He murmured into her hair. \"You want to come sit with us?\" she asked. Tommy shook his head \"I gotta get back to the gym, tell Frank I'm taking Saturday night off.\" \"Friday night- I'm working Saturday.\" \"Friday then. See, you work too hard.\" Tommy said with a crooked smile and then he was gone. February 18th Friday night couldn't come quickly enough. Sonja and Danni insisted that she go home early from work to get ready for her date. Katrina spent the first hour of her free afternoon in the bath washing her hair. Then she shaved her legs and everywhere else. She had a feeling this wasn't going to be your typical first date. As good as his word, Tommy let Katrina pick out the restaurant. She'd settled on a small gastro-pub that she passed on the bus every day on the way to work, it looked cozy inside and not to fancy. This made finding an outfit easier, she didn't have much that would have been suited to an up-scale restaurant anyway not usually having the money to spend on clothes. On her way back from work however she had stopped at a shop on fifth avenue and bought a pretty white-lace top that she could wear over jeans. The top was cut low enough that it made the most of her underwhelming cleavage without being tarty. She slipped it on over her head, assessing herself momentarily in the mirror before getting on with blow-drying her hair. She had the dryer on at full force when Tommy knocked at her door so at first she didn't hear him. He was early and when she opened the door she could see that he was nervous. He wasn't the only one, her stomach flip-flopped over at the sight of him. The man cleaned up good. Out of his customary sweat pants and bulky jumpers Katrina could appreciate just how much muscle Tommy had gained since they first met. The black button-down shirt he was wearing over jeans looked like it might tear off if he breathed too hard. He looked even more attractive than usual clean-shaven for once, Katrina thought she might have trouble getting through dinner without jumping him. She drew in a slightly shaky breath, \"Hi.\" \"Hi.\" He replied, rubbing the back of his neck apprehensively. \"Come on in, you'll have to wait a bit- I haven't got my makeup on yet.\" \"Look pretty good to me.\" Said Tommy, kissing her on the cheek as he stepped into the apartment. She smiled, feeling any nerves subside before slipping back into the bathroom to make up her face. \"You ready?\" Tommy asked as she stepped out of the bathroom five minutes later, he'd been pacing up and down her living room. \"Ready.\" She answered, slipping on her coat and grabbing her purse. \"You won't need that.\" Smiled Tommy, \"I got this one.\" \" Christ the cheque hasn't even come yet- shouldn't I at least get the chance to offer to pay?\" Tommy smiled again, relieving her of her purse \"No point, you know what I'm gonna say.\" \"I guess I do.\" Katrina laughed as Tommy threw her the keys to her appartment and chucked the purse on the couch. \"You're a true gentlemen then.\" \"You're not the only one who was taught some manners by their mother.\" Replied Tommy as he ushered her out of the apartment. The pair chatted idly as they ambled along the streets, it was nice, as though nothing had changed between them and they were still just friendly neighbors. This illusion was shattered when Katrina caught Tommy looking down her top. She felt her cheeks flush and caught his eye, grinning. Tommy at least had the good grace to look somewhat abashed. The restaurant, obviously a neighborhood favorite, was tiny and packed when they arrived. The waiter led them to a table at the back and left them with a pair of menus. Katrina picked hers up and perused it for a moment, she could feel Tommy's eyes on her. \"What?\" she asked, looking up. \"Nothin'.\" He mumbled, looking away hurriedly. Thankfully the awkwardness was diffused by the waiter turning up and asking them what they'd like to drink. \"I'll have a glass of white please,\" said Katrina. Tommy chose a beer and the waiter serving them bustled off into the throng. The conversation flowed more easily after that, Tommy shed his nerves and told her all about MMA; the grueling training regime and the men who he might be facing in SPARTA and upcoming bouts. To Katrina it was like another world, she'd never even seen boxing on the TV much less a sport that could leave it's contestants out cold. Nevertheless, she could picture Tommy in the ring perfectly steel-grey eyes locked on his opponent, the aggression that he carried just under the surface being channeled into violence. Katrina didn't quite know when Tommy's hand found hers over the tabletop. Was it during her salad or afterwards when the conversation turned to past relationships? His fingers tangled with hers, sending her mind completely off track and into the gutter. Somewhere along the line, Tommy admitted that he'd never really had a girlfriend. \"Really? I don't believe it.\" Said Katrina, surprised, \"good looking guy like you?\" Tommy laughed softly, his thumb smoothing the palm of her hand, the action made in incredibly hard for Katrina to concentrate. \"It's true. Just never found the right girl. You?\" \"Find the right girl? No.\" She grinned, \"But I did have one proper boyfriend. Its not easy finding a man to put up with a dancer's lifestyle- you know, training, injuries all the rest.\" Katrina didn't really want to think about the real reason so many of her relationships ended. \"I know what you mean, most people don't understand what it's like bein' an athlete but I s'pose its all you've ever known.\" \"Yeah, and you too I guess.\" Tommy had told her all about how his father coached him to three junior Olympic titles in wrestling when he was young. His voice hardened slightly as he talked about the old man, his drive, and his dreams for his sons. Katrina got the impression that there was a lot of emotion there, some anger, lots of pain- fresh wounds laid down over the old. The waiter deposited the cheque on the table and Tommy took out his wallet. Their eyes met across that table and Katrina laughed. \"One of these days I'll be the one to take you out Thomas Conlon.\" She teased. \"Not gonna happen, as long as you're with me you can leave your purse at home.\" \"I should just start calling you sugar daddy.\" \"What? Cuz' I'm so sweet?\" Tommy smiled, showing his slightly crooked teeth. Katrina loved his smile, it was just as dysfunctional as the rest of him. \"So tell me,\" Tommy asked as they exited the restaurant into the gathering night, \"do you actually speak French?\" \"You've been waiting ages to ask me that haven't you?\" replied Katrina, Tommy nodded. \"Yes, I do speak French, with my mom. Its sort of my first language- when I went away to school I got teased by the other kids because they couldn't understand me.\" She laughed bitterly. Tommy took her hand in his, squeezing gently; Katrina wondered how he was always so warm- even on a night as cold as this one. Their fingers laced together as they walked on in silence. It reminded her of the first time Tommy had dragged her out of the apartment to take a walk in the snow. The snow was all gone now, the last of the grimy slush melted away with the rainstorms that flooded Tommy's flat. The feeling between them though was the same, that excitement and nervousness of discovering something new. She glanced at Tommy and caught his eye. He smiled then stopped walking, turning to face her. \"What?\" she asked, perplexed. Tommy said nothing but cupped her cheek with his free hand and pressed a soft kiss to her lips. Katrina slipped a hand into his jacket and around his broad back, leaning into him. She could hear her heartbeat pounding in her ears as desire began to pool in the pit of her stomach. They broke apart, both gasping for air. \"Been waitin' to do that all night.\" Said Tommy, his voice rougher than usual. They made it back to Oakland Avenue in record time, only her utmost self control stopping Katrina from jumping Tommy in the elevator. In the end they barely made it through the door of her flat, falling though the door and kicking it shut behind them. Katrina's jacket hit the floor with a thud followed by Tommy's as they backed into the living room. Tommy sat down on the couch and pulled Katrina down on top of him. All the best things happen on this couch Katrina thought. Her mind had been kicked into overdrive by Tommy's touch, all her senses on high alert. Feeling bold she started to undo the top buttons on his shirt, tracing the smooth skin across his collarbones and down his chest. She felt Tommy moan into her mouth, the deep, vibration of his chest reverberating into hers. His lips wandered down her neck leaving a trail of electricity in their wake. She swiftly undid the last of the buttons on his shirt, her hands grazing his lower stomach, making him shudder. His kisses became more insistent, bruising almost and Katrina moaned softly with pleasure, her head falling back. Tommy stood up, slipping his hands under Katrina's ass; he carried her up the tiny winding staircase to her bedroom and laid her down on the covers. In the half- light Katrina could see the dark outlines of Tommy's tattoo's writhing over his skin. Feeling fearless, she reached for him, taking his hand, and drawing him down to her; his hips settling in the cradle of hers. Her breath hitched as his weight pressed on the bruise on her hip- pain and pleasure mixing dizzyingly together. Tommy pushed the straps of her top off her shoulders pushing the material to her waist. Katrina arched into him at the touch of his hands on her chest, her legs wrapping around him. \"God you're gorgeous\" she heard Tommy murmur, his words slightly muffled in her cleavage. He helped her out of her top and slid the jeans off her legs until she was lying just in her panties looking up at him. She sat up, legs hanging off the edge of the bed and fumbled with the buttons on his jeans, pushing them off his hips and to the floor, placing a shaking hand on his stomach she felt all his muscles tense and jump at her touch. \"You sure about this?\" he asked, bending down to look into her eyes. Katrina nodded jerkily, realizing that she was shaking all over. \"Just nervous.\" Tommy smiled, pressing his lips to hers briefly, \"don't be- I got this.\" Going to bed with Tommy, Katrina later thought, had definitely ruined her for all other men. Maybe it was his fighting experience or lots of practice or his natural talent, but he seemed to instinctively know the ins and outs of her body, read her every sigh and moan, know exactly what she needed. The heat that ignited between them scared Katrina a little; she'd never felt like this before, the raw need for a man's touch. It was like a fever dream, like dancing with your eyes shut, all her senses were filled up with him, the way he felt; rough and smooth, skin on skin. They lay together, breathing hard both their bodies slicked with sweat Katrina's heart was beating as if she'd run a marathon. Tommy pressed a warm kiss to her collarbone, wrapping his arms around her waist and pulling her flush against him. She listened to as his heartbeat slowly returned to normal, one of her hands tangled in his hair, which needed cutting. \"Mmm,\" Tommy's rumbled, \"you alright?\" Katrina had to smile at that, \"more than alright .\" There was a long silence, Katrina got the feeling Tommy was working up to saying something. \"I know I ain't exactly the romantic type…I wanna be the kind of guy you deserve if you'll let me try…\" Tommy murmured. \"I think you're a lot more romantic than you let on Tommy Conlon\" She felt him smile against her lips. A/n What do you think? Love it? Hate it? Let me know! Xx P.S. Shout out and many thanks to all my beautiful reviewers- I really appreciate that you take the time to react to my work, it means the world to me![Chapter 17] Disclaimer: I don't own Warrior *shock horror!* Chapter 17 February 19th Tommy woke up in the dark. He was warm, almost too hot, he was instantly aware of the woman sprawled across his chest, her soft skin under his hands. Perfect , he thought, stroking his way down her spine. Katrina shifted gently against him and Tommy felt his blood flow south. He checked his watch. Shit, he groaned, it was already five thirty, time to go. He mulled over his options; eight-mile run in the freezing cold or… Katrina shifted her body over his again, one of her legs wrapping around his hips, bringing their bodies closer together… Tommy sighed, sitting up and groping for the bedside light. He scooped his boxers off the ground and slipped them on before looking around for his jeans. Putting them on he stood up. He turned around; she's cute when she's asleep he thought with a smile. He hitched the blankets higher around Katrina's shoulders, not wanting her to get cold. He dropped a kiss on the top of her head still not wanting to leave. She stirred slightly but didn't open her eyes. Although Tommy wouldn't think of it until later, this was only the second time in his life that he'd slept through the night with a woman. Usually after the passion wore off Tommy was straight out the door, he didn't waste time feeling like a jerk. This time though, Tommy found a pen in the desk draw and a post-it. His lips pulled into a grimace as he tried to think of the right thing to say. He hesitated before starting to scribble. Hey K, Last night was great, Great didn't really seem like the right word to use but he'd written it now. I've gone on a run, see you soon. Tommy He put down the pen. Katrina knew he wasn't exactly good with words, but it was the thought that counted right? March 4th \"I'm thinkin' of getting' a new tattoo\" said Tommy to Katrina as they lay in her bed watching the sun come up on a Sunday morning. \"You are? What of?\" she asked, stretching sleepily before snuggling deeper into his side. Your name right over my heart Tommy thought. \"I dunno.\" He replied. \"Not a clue?\" she pressed. \"A lot's happened since I last got ink…\" Katrina's fingers brushed his collarbone where Manny's dog tag numbers were etched, raising goose bumps on his flesh. \"Maybe it's time to, I dunno, write it down.\" \"On your skin?\" \"Yeah…\" Katrina nodded, fingers still tracing the outline of his collarbone, \"where would you put it?\" she asked. \"Probably down the side.\" Said Tommy, indicating his ribs. \"All the way down?\" Tommy shrugged, wrapping his arms around her more tightly. It was still early spring and Katrina refused to put on the heat in her apartment, Tommy could have sworn it was colder inside than out. He was distracted by Katrina's hands dipping under the covers and sliding down his abs making the muscles jump and tense. He felt most of his blood surge downwards turning any further thoughts to white noise. \"I think it's a great idea.\" He felt her whisper against his neck. The last two weeks had been some of the happiest in Tommy's memory, determined to do things by the book Tommy took her out on a second date. Two dates turned into three and before a week had passed they were spending almost every night in bed together. It was getting harder and harder to leave her for work at the crack of dawn, usually they stayed at her place and Katrina had taken to cooking him breakfast in the mornings. Breakfast always seemed to turn into something more and Katrina's couch now had a permanent dent to the cushions. As it was still early and a Sunday neither of them had to get up and Tommy was treated to the sight of Katrina fast asleep. Her hair fanned out on the pillow like a halo. The neck of his Tap-out T-shirt that she was wearing had slipped down over her shoulder, Tommy brushed the exposed skin with the tips of his fingers, not able to resist but trying not to wake her. Tommy had learned over the past two weeks that she was almost as light a sleeper as he was and predictably her eyes fluttered open at his touch, she smiled. \"Hey.\" She whispered, \"What time is it?\" Tommy checked the cellphone he'd left by the bed, \"six thirty.\" Katrina sat up, running her hands through her hair. \"Time to get up.\" \"Seriously? On a Sunday?\" Tommy could feel the heat already leaving her side of the bed. \"Gotta go to mass.\" She replied, voice muffled from the huge sweater she was pulling over her head, a jumper that Tommy recognized to be his own. \"Do you want to come?\" she asked. Tommy sat up and pulled on his boxers to stall having to give an answer. Thankfully Katrina's phone rang just as he was trying to think of a polite way of saying no. \"Sorry\" Katrina mouthed, the person on the other end of the line hadn't given her time to get a word in yet. Judging from the fact that Tommy could make out a voice, the person seemed to be shouting. Katrina wandered downstairs, still listening patiently while Tommy looked about for the rest of his clothes, he sighed, she was wearing his t-shirt and his sweater. Well I'll just have to go and get them… he thought to himself, following Katrina down the stairs. Tommy padded downstairs, sneaking up on Katrina from the back. He pressed a kiss to her neck, just above the collarbone and slipped his hands under her sweater. She squeaked with surprised, jumping like a scaled cat. \"Tommy don't sneak up on me like that!\" she gasped, leaning against him. \"Sorry.\" He replied, gripping her waist more tightly, pulling her close. Katrina sighed, melting into him slightly. This was how it always seemed to be with them in the mornings, Frank was starting to notice how many times Tommy had turned up to work late. Whoever was on the other end of the phone started shouting again, this time much louder. Katrina frowned, holding the phone slightly away from her ear. … calmez-vous si vous plait maman! Mon dieu, c'est pas seriouse! .. From the language Tommy realized Katrina must be talking to her mother; suddenly having his hands up her top seemed really inappropriate. … maman c'est vulgaire! ne me demandez pas ça! ... Tommy tactfully stepped slightly away as the family argument stepped up a notch. … Ne demandez pas si je suis vierge! Je te hais! ... Not giving the other woman time to respond, Katrina shut the phone with a snap. \"putain!\" she spat with surprising viciousness. Then she sighed, \"Sorry about that.\" \"S'oaky, was that your mom?\" Katrina nodded, biting her lip. \"I don't like fighting with her but sometimes…\" \"Families fight- I get it. Never heard you speak French before…\" He tried to reassure her but Katrina just shrugged. \"Well you just heard about every French swearword in the book.\" She replied bitterly. \"What were you fighting about?\" Tommy put his arms around her waist again, resuming their earlier position. \"You.\" She replied miserably. \"My mom just realized that we sleep together and now she's convinced that I'll go to hell.\" \"Go to hell ?\" he asked, \"d'you really believe in all that?\" Katrina paused, \"I try not to think about it… I used to, was terrified of hell when I was younger… but now, I don't know.\" Katrina's eyes flickered to his for a moment, before fixing on the floor. \"Do you think what we're doing is wrong?\" Tommy asked, waiting apprehensively for an answer. \"I know it is. I know I shouldn't, but I like you too much to stop. I just can't think of being with you as really being a sin…\" There was a smile in her voice now. \"Although what we did last night was pretty sinful . \" Tommy kissed her then, holding her close. Knowing that Katrina felt guilty about what they did together roused some strange emotion in him. Was it jealousy? Was it possessiveness? He didn't know, what he did know was that it hurt, deeply, knowing that he might loose her like this. Words not being Tommy's strong point he knew that he could never hope to put into words how he was feeling, what he did with his body would have to be enough. Half an hour later Tommy wandered downstairs to his own flat; the place was getting a bit neglected, glasses piling up in the sink and the sheets needed changing. He supposed that his military past still required him to keep a certain standard of neatness around him at all times. He liked things to be orderly and clean, in fact the more complicated his life got the more he tended to focus on that. A psychiatrist would likely tell him he had a problem, needed to loosen up but he was set in his ways now. Anyway, cleaning things up was a good outlet for his energy, it would help him work off some of the emotion of the morning in a productive way. Tommy thought that should be good enough for any psychiatrist and set to rolling up the sleeves of his reclaimed sweater and starting to wash up. The elastic of the sleeves bit slightly into his forearms, he was finally putting on some real muscle, filling out as he had been before Sparta. He'd got his appetite back, training with Frank was intense, almost more so than training with Pop. They had different styles but after loosing to his brother Tommy felt ready to switch things up a little in the cage. The training he was doing now was as much mental as physical, the Frank was tough, but nothing compared to Pop's levels of slave driving. The trainer's real magic lay in how he taught his fighters to think in the cage rather than just rely on instinct as Tommy had for so long, he was getting the hang of it slowly, sparring with men of Jay's size had certainly put his own strength into perspective and forced him to work harder on his technique. His body was definitely changing though and he had a feeling that he was going to come back even stronger than ever. The phone rang- the landline call meaning it could only be Brendan on the other end as only he had that number. Tommy quickly dried his hands before picking up. \"Bren?\" he asked. \"Tommy? Good, I thought you might be out- you never pick up these days.\" Tommy smiled, he was never home these days. \"Sorry about that, why'd you call?\" \"Other than just wanting to talk?\" Tommy could hear Bren laughing to himself, \"Tess wants to invite you to dinner, says the girls are missing you.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah, I think she's worried about you not having a home cooked meal in too long.\" Tommy smiled again, it turned out that Katrina was an excellent cook so Tess needn't be worried. \"That'd be great.\" He paused, inspiration striking, \"D'you know what?\" \"What?\" \"I want you to meet someone.\" \"Someone? Who?\" \"Umm…\" tommy swallowed thickly, \"A girl- we're dating… or something.\" \"oh… a girl … well congratulations little brother!\" Tommy snorted, \"stop it Bren, we're not gettin' married or anytin' just casual y'know?\" \"But you're showing her off to all of us ? Sounds pretty casual.\" Tommy barked a laugh at his brother's sarcasm. They agreed that Brendan would pick them up a five; it was a long drive out to Monroeville and even longer if you had to take the bus. Tommy vowed in return that he would sort out getting a car in the near future and get the broken down \"piece of trash\" he'd driven to Brendan's house in off his brother's lawn. The car had broken down immediately after he turned off the engine, Brendan's house was the first stop he'd made after leaving Camp George, driving through the night and all day to cross the country back to his only family. Tommy couldn't actually remember much about the trip- too strung out on the pain meds and anxiety pills that the military doctors made him take. The whole memory was blurred and jittery as though filmed on a shaky hand-camera. It was sort of a relief when the ache in his shoulder came back, meaning that the drugs were wearing off. Unfortunately as his body cleared its self of the narcotics, the fog of pain, both physical and mental almost sent him right off the road. It was a miracle he didn't crash really- maybe he should've taken Katrina up on her offer of going to church. The image of her sprinting out the door stuck in his mind as he dried the last of the dishes in the sink. St. Paul's cathedral in down town Pittsburgh was apparently a very \"big deal\" as far as churches went so Katrina was obliged to dress up a little. Tommy had time to drink two whole cups of coffee as she dashed around the apartment frantically pulling out clothes and doing up her hair. He had never seen her in anything so nice- a pretty blue dress and heels that made her higher than his shoulder for the first time. He liked the heels- it made it easier to bend down and kiss her. Although it was nice to see his girl all dressed up, in a way it made her guilt about their relationship hurt all the more. The church was never something that particularly called to him, especially after the death of his mother Tommy had felt abandoned with God. Angry with him for letting his mother die in agony and for turning him into an orphan at the age of seventeen. His mother's faith had scared him near the end, the gleam in her eyes as she told him about heaven. It wasn't healthy he decided, especially Katrina's fear of hell, she'd told him she didn't really believe in that anymore but he'd seen the dread in her eyes. He'd have to talk to her about that. Tommy spent the rest of the day exercising. He went on a long run using the route he used to go on with Pop who'd drive alongside him hollering encouragement. It really wasn't the same without the old man there but he made it around just the same, all ten miles of it. After that it was weights at Frank's gym- the place was open on Sundays really just for the professionals and to give Frank a chance to keep up with the paperwork. Tommy had a quick shower before changing into a fresh pair of sweats and a vest. The place was mostly empty- even the pro fighters had to go home sometime, even if just to keep their wives and girlfriends happy. Tommy wondered what it would be like between him and Katrina when he got back into the cage again, if even lasted that long. When they were together Tommy never thought about the possibility that things wouldn't work out in the long run. When he was with her he never had any doubts, in fact he rarely worried about anything when she was around it was like being invincible. It was a different story though when they were apart though. Tommy couldn't stop himself from thinking of all the ways that things could go wrong, all the ways he might drive her away; his PTSD, the nightmares, his crazy pre-fight training schedule, and his nasty temper which she'd already had to deal with. He was completely out of his depth with this, fucking inexperienced. \"Tommy?\" He whipped around at the sound of someone calling his name. It was Frank, come out of his office and grinning like a cat with the cream. \"What's up with you?\" asked Tommy, turning to face him fully. \"Good news.\" Smiled Frank, \"I got you a fight- here in Pittsburgh in three weeks.\" \"Who against?\" asked Tommy, the news not really sinking in. \"Forrest Griffin, the brawler from Georgia.\" Frank was evidently very pleased with himself. Tommy felt a smile break out over his face, \"Thanks man, really means a lot y'know. Three weeks y'say?\" \"Three weeks my man.\" Answered Frank, slapping Tommy on the back, \"you'll be ready.\" \"I sure will.\" With a final nod, Tommy strode purposefully to the weights. Forrest Griffin wouldn't know what'd hit him. A/N well this was a long time coming- I hope you guys haven't completely given up on me! I'm not really sure about the faith aspect of this chapter you'll have to tell me where you guys stand on that but given the direction I'm thinking of going with this story I think a little background on Katrina's family and beliefs is necessary. (idk?) I'm not entirely sure about the characterization with this chapter- I know that usually if Tommy is upset about something then that generally comes out as anger but I don't really see them having a fight about their issues just yet… Also a note about the French, I didn't translate it basically because this chapter is from Tommy's point of view and he doesn't understand a word it. When its Katrina's view then I'll translate and all will become clear! Heads up- if anyone has ideas for scenes you would like to see between the lovebirds, now is the time to make your requests- I'm in serious need of inspiration for the coming chapters before the sh*t hits the fan! Thanks again for everyone who's stuck with this story and put it on favorite or story alert and an extra-special thank you for all you beautiful reviewers, I really couldn't write this without your help and support! xxxx[Chapter 18] Hey guys, just wanted a quick head's up before this chapter starts- I think I might have given people the wrong idea with my last A/N, this is not going to be a \"religious themed\" story, so no worries about that ok? I'm still debating starting over with that chapter but it's done now so…. Onwards and upwards! Also all your suggestions as to what should happen next have been great and really gotten me back on track! Chapter 18 February 19th Katrina stood joined the steady stream of people exiting the church as behind them the last bars of Abide With Me rumbled from the organ. As she left the building shrugging on her jacket, the cold wind whistled around her, throwing her long hair into disarray, sticking it to her lip-gloss. Katrina dug around in her handbag for her cell phone. One text from Tommy flashed up on the screen and she felt herself smile as she opened it. This smile quickly turned faded as she read- he wanted her to meet his brother? Katrina didn't know much about the Conlon family history; Tommy wasn't exactly loquacious and didn't like to talk about the past. She did know however that he and his brother were very close, the very first place he'd gone after getting out of the Marines. Katrina felt herself getting apprehensive; this was all going a little fast wasn't it? Given Tommy's relationship with his father meeting Brendan was kind of like going home to his folks. She blew out a long breath into the cold air and watched it curl away like smoke. It'll be fine, she tried to reassure herself , they're lovely people and you'll all get along perfectly. She didn't give her insecurities time to get the best of her but texted back her answer immediately. She looked at her phone again, one missed call from her mother. She'd save that conversation for later, still a bit too angry to be grown up about the situation. Katrina's child hood, isolated on the tiny islands of Maine had been molded and defined by her mother's break with her own family. As an adult Katrina could see how a scared, single seventeen-year-old mother would welcome the small tight-knit community of North Haven. She could see how the church became her backbone and its teachings her guidance. Nevertheless, there came a time when you had to take off the training wheels. You only live once right? Katrina looked up at the sky as though it might give her some sign, the sun was starting to break through the lowering clouds. That's good enough for me she thought. Katrina was made sure to be ready long before six when Tommy's brother was due to pick them up. Her apartment was littered with clothes that she'd tried on and discarded. Knowing Tommy she doubted that this would be any sort of fancy affair but she wanted desperately to make a good impression. After all, she thought, you only get to make a first impression. She settled on wearing her hair down as she'd just been to the hairdresser the other day and it was looking reasonable for once. She'd just decided on a pair of flats to go with that white top she'd worn for her first date with Tommy when the doorbell rang. It was Tommy; looking slightly tense Katrina realized that this must be nerve-wracking for him too. \"Hey, come on in.\" she said. He pressed his lips to her cheek as he passed her, he'd shaved, and Katrina could smell the Imperial Lather soap he always used, clean and fresh. She caught his hand to stop him moving away and kissed him properly. \"I'm sorry about this morning.\" She whispered between kisses. \"S'okay.\" He replied, his voice more felt than heard. \"No, I was being… weird, I'm sorry.\" Tommy's eyes flickered up to meet hers; he was frowning slightly as he always did when he was thinking about what to say. Then he shrugged, expression clearing. \"No need to apologize.\" The pair of them moved against the couch, the back of Katrina's knees hit the seat and she almost collapsed into it. Tommy was absentmindedly rubbing the nape of her neck with one callused hand and she leaded into him in silent encouragement. Outside a car horn sounded, catching Katrina's attention. \"Time to go\" Katrina said, checking her watch. It wasn't until Tommy squeezed her hand that she realized that they'd been shaking. \"Nervous?\" he asked with a wry smile. Katrina nodded, and felt rather than heard his quiet laughter rumbling through the both of them. \"Don't be.\" Brendan's house was a real reflection of the man himself Katrina thought to herself as they arrived. It had been a quiet drive, eager to beat the traffic they hadn't stopped for proper introductions just hopped in and got on the highway. Brendan was different to his brother in looks, much fairer and less angular, a kind and open face, perfect for a kind and open-hearted man. The house was inviting, all caramel woods, and warm colors. There were kid's toys in the front yard and finger paintings in picture frames along side the family pictures. Before she'd had time to take in much else a pretty blonde woman who could only be Tess appeared, beaming at the end of the hallway. \"Tommy, it's great to see you!\" she rushed up and hugged Tommy who reciprocated with a smile. \"So you must be the girl Tommy wanted us to meet huh?\" asked Tess turning to her. Katrina smiled a little, feeling shy, \"Yeah, I'm Katrina, its lovely to meet you- you have a really great house here.\" Tess beamed again, \"Well its lovely to meet you too Katrina- can I call you Katy?\" \"Yeah sure, everyone does.\" She found herself warming quickly to Tess's unstoppable charm. \"Great, come on in out of the cold and we'll introduce you to the girls.\" The girls it turned out didn't need any introducing as next moment two tiny creatures came sprinting down the hallway with twin cries of \"Daddy!\" and \"Uncle Tommy!\" They threw themselves on their uncle and Katrina was treated to the sight of Tommy well out of his depth. He hoisted both girls up into his arms and gave them a hug. \"How've my favorite girls been huh?\" he asked them. \"We've been good!\" the older one replied, pigtails askew. \"Glad to hear it.\" Tommy chuckled before setting them down and crouching down so that he didn't tower over then. \"I want you to meet my friend, Katy.\" Katrina blushed at being introduced and held out a hand for them to shake. \"I'm Emily,\" the older girl said, shaking Katina's hands solemnly. \"And I'm Rosie, my birthday is next week.\" Said the smaller girl, her words slightly muffled by the thumb in her mouth. \"Nice to meet you Emily and you too Rosie, have you thought about what you want for your birthday?\" Rosie shook her head, eyes wide; \"Daddy says it's a surprise so I hope it's a puppy.\" She smiled, showing astoundingly grapy teeth. \"I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.\" Katrina promised, both girls giggled happily and darted away into the sitting room. \"They're sweet.\" Katrina said. \"Yeah, they're great.\" Smiled Brendan, leading everyone into the family room where the Emily hurriedly switched the TV from a re-run of Mean Girls back to the game before taking her little sister's hand and scampering off for the play room. \"You're good with them.\" Murmured Tommy, his hands finding that favorite spot on Katrina's waist as he passed behind her. \"Thanks,\" she whispered back. The two brothers settled themselves on the couch to watch the pre-game talks and match analysis as Tess led Katrina into the kitchen across the hall. Pouring Katrina a large glass of white wine she turned to her in a conspiratorial manor. \"So,\" Tess began, \"tell me all about yourself.\" \"Umm,\" Katrina flushed again, not knowing what to say, \"I dance with the Pittsburgh ballet company…\" Tess interrupted her, \"For real?\" \"Yeah, for real.\" \"Wow, a real live ballerina,\" Tess laughed and Katrina knew that they would be friends, \"what about you and Tommy?\" Katrina took a sip of her wine before answering, \"I met him the day he moved in, just bumped into each other… I guess one thing just lead to another?.\" \"That's sweet\" said Tess, topping up their wine glasses, Katrina could feel the alcohol bringing a flush to her cheeks. \"He must like you a lot to bring out all the way out here.\" Katrina giggled self-consciously, \"Well I don't know about that, but I do like him.\" \"Good.\" Said Tess, \"I haven't know Brendan's brother a long time and lord knows we didn't meet under the best of circumstances but if anyone deserves a happily ever after then it's got to be Tommy.\" Katrina took a gulp of wine, \"well I'll have to see what we can do about that.\" She changed the subject, curious suddenly, \"so tell me all about you, did I really see a prom picture of you and Brendan on the mantelpiece?\" Tess settled herself on the kitchen counter top and regaled Katrina with the highly amusing story of her and Brendan's first date at a McDonalds down town. Only half way though she leapt up with a curse and sprinted to the oven only to wrench it open and be engulfed suddenly in a cloud of smoke. \"Do you want some help?\" Katrina asked. \"Sure!\" Replied Tess from somewhere in the cloud, she managed to rescue a slightly burnt pie from the oven before turning on the smoke extractor above the range. Katrina busied herself locating knives, forks, and plates from the cupboards. She was surprised at how clean the place was considering that they had two children; she didn't think that her own house had ever been a tenth this orderly when she was growing up. Katrina helped Tess and the girls set the table; Tess gave the girls the cutlery and then had to go around after them fixing when they put the knives and forks the wrong way around. \"Its still kind of early to eat don't you think?\" asked Katrina, looking at the clock on the wall. \"We'll wait until the game is over I think.\" Replied Tess, motioning to the two men on the couch both waving their arms and shouting at a perceived injustice by the umpire. \"Don't worry,\" smiled Tess, \"the boys have to do the washing up.\" \" Oh I see how this household works, I like your thinking Tess.\" With the food safely in a warming oven and the places set Tess was free to go back to her story about her first date from hell with Brendan but instead she topped up Katrina's glass, ignoring her protestations and turned to her with a very serious expression. \"So Katy, you know that Tommy's a fighter don't you?\" Katrina nodded, not knowing where Tess was going with this. \"And you're okay with that, because I know when Brendan was fighting it really tore me apart to see that.\" \"Brendan is a fighter?\" asked Katrina, looking over at the man on the couch in surprise. Brendan was a big guy for sure but he seemed far to gentle to make a living with his fists. \"Was a fighter… Tommy didn't tell you?\" Tess's eyebrows disappeared into her fringe. \"Tell me what?\" asked Katrina, curiosity piqued. \"Yeah tell her what?\" Came a deep voice from the doorway, it was Tommy leaning on the frame. \"Brendan said there's beers in the fridge… \" \"Oh, right yeah there is,\" Tess stepped aside, \"I was just talking about you and Brendan in the Sparta finals. You guys didn't talk about that yet?\" Tommy fixed her with an inscrutable look. \"Nope we didn't.\" Then he sloped off, Katrina could read the defensiveness in his posture, could see that his walls were already springing back up. \"Shoot,\" said Tess. Katrina could only nod in agreement. Neither woman brought up Sparta again in their conversation as the football match slowly wound up to it's conclusion, the Pittsburgh Steelers wining the day. Dinner started off relaxed, the positive outcome of the football match giving them all lots to talk about around the table and the questions of the little girls putting them all in fits of laughter. Katrina was sitting in between Tommy and Emily, who had taken pride of place at the end of the table. She could see Tommy smiling and laughing along with the others but could also feel the tension radiating off him. Eventually the conversation turned to work, Brendan told them a little about his time as a physics teacher, he'd been promoted to the head of department at Monroeville High. Katrina could hear the pride in his voice as he talked about the students who were making so much progress before their mid-terms. It was nice, she thought, that a man could have such a vocation that even after becoming as rich as Croesus he still devotes himself to the day job. Tess fired a few questions at her about her life as a dancer and she was happy to oblige, sugar coating it shamelessly for the benefit of Emily and Rosie who were listening with rapt attention. \"So you're like Angelina Ballerina?\" asked Rosie, eyes like saucers. \"Yes just like that.\" \"Do you think I could be a ballerina?\" asked Emily, gazing up at Katrina with big blue eyes. \"Of course you can doll, maybe you could come and see where I work someday?\" She glanced at Brendan and Tess to see if that would be alright. They smiled and Emily nodded enthusiastically. After desert, a slightly singed pumpkin pie, Tess put the kids to bed and Brendan opened another bottle of wine. The conversation fell into a lull and Katrina could feel Tommy's incessant need to fidget starting to get the better of him. His leg was tapping under the table at increasing speed. She put her hand on his knee. \"So are you getting pumped up for your first fight then Tommy?\" asked Brendan. Katrina choked slightly on a sip of wine and Tommy patted her hastily on the back. \"Yeah, I guess, I only found out today…\" Katrina turned to Tommy, finally able to breathe. \"You're fighting again? You didn't say!\" \"Yeah… found out this mornin'. Forrest Griffin.\" He replied somewhat gruffly. Under the table Tommy's leg started to bounce again. \"Griffin?\" Brendan asked, eyebrows raised, \"the ex-sheriff?\" \"Yep. In three weeks.\" Three weeks? Katrina thought. \"That's really soon.\" Said Brendan, voicing what Katrina was thinking. \"I s'pose so. Fight's in Pittsburgh so I don't have to travel for this one.\" \"You ever seen Tommy fight?\" asked Brendan to Katrina who was glad of the escape from her thoughts. \"Not yet but I guess I will be soon.\" \"You never got curious and Googled him?\" said Brendan with a wry smile. Katrina felt Tommy up tense slightly next to her. \"Nope.\" The conversation lapsed again. Katrina was starting to feel really awkward; she could tell that Tommy didn't want to talk about his past fights so she let silence fall. Tess broke it, ever polite and seemingly un-phased by Tommy glowering over the table at her husband. \"How's about you guys get to cleaning up while Katy and I have more girl-time.\" She cast a slightly forced smile in Brendan's direction. Before leading a helpless Katrina into the family room. From the room behind them they could hear the brothers arguing in terse under-tones, too quietly for Katrina to make out what they were saying. Not that she was eaves dropping or anything. Tess was chatting a mile a minute, seemingly her defense mechanism whenever things got awkward. Katrina nodded and smiled, not really taking in what she was saying. After about twenty minutes of watching home movies of the little girl's last school-play, a shadow fell across the doorway. Again it was Tommy, scowl lifted slightly. He looked rueful if anything and Katrina hoped that he and Brenan's argument had managed to sort it's self out. \"We've gotta go if we're gonna get the last bus into town.\" He said gruffly, nodding at Katrina who felt half-relieved and half sad to go. They said their goodbyes quickly before slipping into the freezing night air. They walked in silence for a few minutes, breath clouding in front of them like unfilled speech bubbles. They'd almost reached the bus stop when Tommy's hand found hers and squeezed it tight. She knew that tonight was not a night for questions, the argument was still too fresh and painful, but with his hand in hers she knew that they could bridge the gap. I love reviews like a fat kid loves cake- and I should know all about that! xx[Chapter 19] Chapter 19 February 24th Tommy knew something was up when he woke excruciatingly early on a dim Saturday morning to find Katrina pacing up and down the length of her tiny bedroom. He sat up but she didn't seem to notice, just made another trip around the room, running her hands through her hair and muttering indistinctly to herself. Tommy watched her for a moment before rising to meet her. She stopped short, startled. \"Did I wake you up?\" Katrina asked. Tommy shook his head, \"come back to bed?\" \"I can't sleep.\" She said as Tommy took her hand and drew her back under the blankets. It was still bitterly cold in the apartment and Tommy jumped as Katrina's freezing feet made contact with his legs. \"Sorry.\" She whispered. \"S'okay… what's goin' on?\" Tommy knew that something had to be wrong to get Katrina out of bed early on the weekend. Katrina groaned quietly, eyes closed as though blocking out some intense pain. \"The show starts today… great …\" She brought her hands up to cover her face before peeking out at him. Comprehension dawning, Tommy understood what she was talking about, first night of Snow White, of course. Then a thought came to him and he frowned at her. \"You didn't get me a ticket.\" He tried not to sound accusatory but he'd already asked Frank about inviting her to see him fight against Forrest Griffin in two weeks time. To his surprise Katrina smiled, \" actually I did, but not for tonight, it's bad luck.\" \"Bad luck. Really?\" Tommy could feel the edges of his mouth curl into a smile at her superstition. \"Don't you dare laugh! I'm stressed out enough already.\" she tried to smack him but he caught her hand, so small in his that he could fold his fingers right over hers. \"Well let's see what I can do about that then.\" Tommy mumbled, stealing a kiss. He heard Katrina's intake of breath as his lips began to travel lower, down her neck, shoulders, cleavage, stomach… by the time he was finished she wouldn't even remember her own name. Tommy stayed awake staring into the darkness; he'd been sleeping better than usual lately. He attributed it to all the late-night \"workouts\" he'd been having between the sheets. All the same, on the nights he slept alone he still woke to the sounds of screams and gunfire. Occasionally the nightmares were so vivid that he swore he could feel the sand creeping into the crevasses of his body armor and the heat of the day beating down on him. After those dreams he'd wake and have to force himself to lie still and wait until his body stopped shaking. The muscles so tense it was painful, the nightmares still clawing at his consciousness. Trapped in the darkness with only his rising panic for company, it was on those nights that he wished he hadn't chucked all his Oxycodone down Brendan's sink. Katrina shifted, frowning in her sleep. Tommy hesitated for a moment before starting to rub wide, slow circles on her back with the hand that wasn't tangled up in her hair. She sighed softly, stretching like a cat. Tommy took a deep breath; if she kept that up he'd need a cold shower soon. He pressed a kiss to the top of her head, pulling her closer, their limbs entangling. Even after three weeks Tommy was still surprised by how her tiny body could be so fragile looking but so wonderfully strong. He was still afraid of hurting her when they were together of crushing her or holding her too tightly. When the sun came up they both rose and Tommy started to make breakfast. He usually had bacon and eggs to start off the day, his mother had taught him to cook that much at least. It was quiet in the kitchen; Katrina was slumped on one of the stools, nursing a cup of the blackest, sweetest coffee. Usually, Tommy reflected, she was the chatty one, taking him out of his moods and getting him to open up. The silence stretched out with only the sounds of cooking in the background, not a comfortable silence, but the kind that needs to be filled. Katrina was the expert at this and as Tommy cast about for something to say, he drew a blank. \"Tommy,\" he turned quickly from to stove to look at her. \"Yeah?\" Katrina looked at him over the rim of her coffee cup, from the way her knuckles had turned white around the handle, Tommy could see that she was nervous about something. \"What?\" he asked. \"Last weekend, when we went to your brother's house… what was that all about?\" Tommy had wondered when she was going to ask this but still hadn't come up with a good answer. The truth, unbidden, sprang to the forefront of his mind. \"You wanna to know what happened at Sparta?\" Katrina nodded. It took Tommy a moment to find the right words, rubbing both hands through his hair distractedly. \"Brendan and I were in Sparta together, Frank was his trainer back then and I was just out of the Marines.\" He paused, trying to fit the facts together in his mind, the story came out haltingly, and Tommy kept glancing up at Katrina to see if she understood but every time he looked her dark eyes were still trained on him. He started with deserting his unit, picking up where they'd left off last time, in the desert. He told her about going to Colt's gym and beating Mad Dog, about training with his father, staying in his childhood bedroom. He told her about seeing the poster for Sparta and seeing the adverts on TV, he told her about his promise to look after Pilar and her kids after Manny died. He had to pause then, voice threatening to break. He took a deep breath, Katrina's gaze never left his face. He continued, describing in a low voice how Brendan had beaten him in the final of Sparta, dislocating his shoulder. He was about to tell her about Brendan's own troubles when Katrina interrupted him. \" Brendan put you in the hospital?\" she asked, aghast. Tommy nodded, then shrugged, \"Don't matter now, like I said, we're on good terms now and he had his own reasons.\" \"I'd hate to see what bad terms is.\" Tommy smiled slightly, coming over to sit opposite her, he put his hands over hers, still gripping the coffee cup tightly. \"I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier… but you can see why I didn't want you to know right?\" She nodded, turning her hands over so that she could lace her fingers though his. \"It's alright… as long as you're alright\" Tommy's heart seemed to constrict in his chest, almost painfully. He was wondering whether to lean over and kiss her when a strong burning smell reached them. \"Shit!\" he swore, leaping up and throwing a pan-full of burning eggs and bacon into the sink. Katrina didn't stop laughing at him for the next ten whole minutes whilst Tommy cleaned her pan and scrubbed the burned fat off of her stovetop. \"You'd make quite the house husband.\" She remarked as Tommy threw himself down into the seat opposite her. He shrugged, a slight smile quirking his lips, \"old habits.\" \"Do you want some cereal or something? It's in the bottom cupboard there.\" Tommy shook his head, \"Don't worry about it, I should probably be off anyway.\" Katrina nodded, checking her watch, Tommy saw her cheeks blanch. \"Sugar.\" \"What?\" he asked, helping himself absently to the last of her coffee. In answer Katrina jumped up and started pulling clothes out of the dresser. She mumbled something incoherently about being late. Tommy gathered his apartment keys off the bench and let her hustle him to the door, helping her pull a t-shirt over her head as they went. He brushed her hair away from her eyes as they stood facing each other from opposite sides of the doorway. As usual when he knew he should say something, Tommy couldn't come up with the words, he trusted his gut instead. Her skin was gorgeously soft under his hands as he kissed her, gently, urgently, trying to show her how much this morning had meant to him. Katrina's finger tangled in his hair, tracing lines across the nape of his neck, melting into him as she always did. All too soon they broke apart, the sound of their breathing filling the space between them. \"Good luck tonight darlin'.\" \"Thanks, don't wait up for me, I'll be out late.\" she whispered. And with that they parted ways. February 25th It was dark when Tommy heard a sharp rap on the door and his head jerked up from where he'd been almost asleep on the couch in front of a late-night darts tournament. He heaved himself up, feeling the cramp in his back flare and burn. The person knocked again. Tommy felt himself getting irritated, what the fuck was so important at this time of night? He sighed and unlocked the door, throwing it open. On the other side was Katrina, leaning against the doorframe as though it was the one thing stopping her from sinking to the floor. She was soaking wet from the rain and the tiny red dress she was wearing clung to every inch of her body. \"Hey!\" she said brightly, smiling at him with wine-red lips to match the dress. Tommy raised his eyebrows. \"Hey.\" \"So… sorry to turn up this late but-\" she sighed, \"the lift's broken and three floors is more than I can handle.\" He had to crack a smile at that, three in the morning or not. \"So, can I come in?\" she asked, attempting another winning smile. \"Course.\" As it turned out he practically had to carry her to the couch, as Katrina's co-ordination was not up to the challenge of six-inch heels. She giggled, flopping down unceremoniously. \"How was it?\" he asked, helping her take her shoes off. \"Oh my god… amazing… I barely remember any of it.\" She giggled again and Tommy noticed that she was shivering badly. \"Cold?\" \"Yeah, I had to walk the last few blocks.\" She tried to wipe away some of the makeup that had smudged under her eyes. Tommy frowned, \"By yourself?\" She nodded, \"I'm a big girl Tommy.\" This didn't sit well with Tommy, he didn't like to think of her out in the dark alone in this part of town, but he realized that it was a conversation for another time, when she wasn't plastered. \"How 'bout I run you a bath?\" he asked as her shivering worsened. She nodded distractedly, slipping off her jacket and starting to peel off her tights. Tommy stood and retreated to the bathroom, he realized his t-shirt was soaking wet from carrying Katrina and covered in her makeup. He stripped it off adding it to a pile of dirty clothes that he needed to take to the launderette. When he returned from the bathroom he found Katrina curled up on his couch in only her bra and pants, she'd pulled a blanket half over herself and seemed to be asleep, her chest rising and falling gently. The dress, if you could call it that, and jacket were on the floor along with her soaking wet tights. Tommy wondered for a moment if it was all right to check out a drunk and passed out girl if she was your girlfriend. He shook that thought out of his head and tried to wake her. \"Katy come on, get up.\" He shook her gently. She groaned, frowning, \"Fuck off.\" Tommy let out an exasperated sigh, \"come on Katy time to get in the bath.\" \"I'm asleep.\" She mumbled, rolling over \"Come on,\" Tommy scooped Katrina up into his arms, shuddering slightly as her freezing skin came into contact with his own. The sensation was short lived however, steam had filled the bathroom turning it into a sauna. Tommy deposited Katrina on the edge of the bath, crouching down so they were at eye level. \"You alright?\" he asked. She nodded, \"fine, just a bit dizzy is all.\" When she stated to remove her bra Tommy stood up, Katrina was strictly a lights-off girl. \"Do you want me to go?\" he asked. Katrina looked up at him, a wicked smile playing across her lips. \"Come in with me.\" \"What?\" \"Come on, there's space for us both.\" She turned and dropping her knickers, faced him with such an uncharacteristic lack of shyness that it almost made him blush. \"Alright.\" He agreed, stripping off with a grin. Katrina turned over in the water with a splash that went all over the floor. They were pressed together now, front to front. Tommy automatically wound his arms around her, running them up and down her back. He wondered when that had become second nature to him. To reach out and pull someone closer, rather than pushing them away, to let his hands find that spot on her waist she especially liked, he didn't know nor did he much care. The here and now was much more important and here and now they were tangled together in Tommy's bathtub, soap slicking their skins and clouding the water in one of the most peaceful moments of Tommy's life. Katrina ran her fingers in a slow pattern over the tribal tattoo on his forearm and shoulder, leaving a trail of goose bumps that even the warm water couldn't take away. She sighed, breaking the rhythm of their slow, shared breathing, looking up at him. Even now her eyes were slightly unfocussed, glazed. In a way though, Tommy felt as though he was seeing her more clearly, almost for the first time. Her defenses were finally down, the walls that she'd built were being shed as suddenly as the clothes that lay discarded across the floor. Katrina smiled, and Tommy felt his chest constrict just as it had that morning, as though someone had squeezed his heart with their bare hands. Without thinking about it he hoisted her up the last few necessary inches and kissed her full on the lips. She wound her arms around his neck, their bodies flush together sending a heat wave of lust straight down into the pit of his stomach. I love you. The words flashed through Tommy's brain like lightning, searing everything in its path. Tommy kissed Katrina again, occupying his lips before he said something stupid. A/n- So happy Christmas and New Years guys, so sorry that this update took forever! My life has been under some serious renovation, moving countries and getting ready for uni but hopefully this chapter will go down well and I'll get on with the next one! Tell me what you think xoxo[Chapter 20] Disclaimer: I own nothing Chapter 20 February 25th Katrina woke the next morning to a pounding headache. Last night the two of them must have found their way up the stairs and into Tommy's bed, the sheets were tangled around her legs. She sat up, wincing, her stomach churning. Tommy was fast asleep beside her, sprawled on his back, taking up most of the mattress as usual. With a start she realized that they were both stark naked, this was hardly a rarity for Tommy, who seemed to shed clothes like leaves in the autumn, she on the other hand had never slept naked in her life. The memories of the previous night started to play through her mind, strangely distorted as though a carnival mirror. Things started out relatively tame, after the show there had been a cocktail party to commemorate the occasion. Katrina slipped on her now ruined red dress and heels straight after the last act, leaving on her stage makeup for dramatic effect. She had vague memories of speeches and donations being made and the polite applause of well-heeled society ladies. Things hadn't really got going until Vlad swept them all out the door to go clubbing at midnight. Already over the top on two glasses of champagne and still buzzing with adrenaline, Katrina had allowed herself to be hustled into a taxi. She checked her wrists, the bath water had smudged the stamps from the clubs they went into, smearing the words and pictures, and turning her arms and hands into an inky mess. Things had really started to blur after the third round of shots, she remembered seeing Mark making eyes at the handsome bartender and being sent a cosmopolitan by some men in suits down the bar. The strobe lights and thumping bass of the last place they went into had started to make her feel dizzy, the dance floor tilting at strange angles. Katrina remembered saying a quick goodbye to Sonja and the others before trekking up Fifth Avenue in her heels. A walk in the cold might have been sobering had it not been for the whiskey and sodas that were going two for one. A blush crept up her cheeks as she remembered turning up at Tommy's apartment at three in the morning, undressing in front of him, she'd been bold and strangely shameless, pulling him into the bath with her, running her hands over his chest… it wasn't only her face that was burning now. She slid out of bed, pulling on one of Tommy's discarded gym t-shirts as she went, it smelled of him, which was strangely comforting. Tommy stirred but didn't wake as her weight left the bed, she let him sleep, pressing a kiss to his stubble-roughened cheek. Katrina stayed with him a moment, watching his chest rise and fall as he breathed. She laced her fingers through his listening to the even rhythm of his heart before rising and tiptoeing down the stairs. Katrina scooped her handbag, dress, tights, and shoes off the couch before heading for the door. She didn't bother looking for her underwear as it could be anywhere. It was raining outside as it so often seemed to be in Pittsburgh, a fine mist sifting down from low, grey clouds. The damp reached its fine fingers inside Katrina's jacket as she left for the bus, up the sleeves and down the collar. She shivered, wishing she'd worn a scarf. The bus stop was empty when she arrived, so she slipped on a pair of headphones and started up some music on her phone to pass the time. It started mid-way through her solo music from last night. Shivering strings giving way to flutes and clarinets with none of the orchestral grandeur of most of the other scenes. She smiled to herself, resisting the urge to begin dancing along incase anyone was watching. She wiggled her toes in time with the music, trying to keep warm as much as anything. She wished now that Tommy had seen her perform, it seemed silly to still ban people from the first night on the strength of a childhood superstition. All the same, it was a relief to have the first night out of the way, the dry run her mother had always called it. Now she could focus on perfecting her solo, fine-tuning before tomorrow night. The music ended, fading away like dream after waking but Katrina hit the back button and listened to it again, determined to get the music into her head. Easily bored by anything that resembled repetition, her attention soon wandered. She was brought back down to earth by her phone buzzing. It was a text from Tommy. K, You left your panties here, I'll be training late tonight Key is under the mat. X Katrina felt herself warm from the inside out as she saw that he'd signed off with a kiss. This was so completely unlike Tommy, given usually to only the gruffest of endearments. She knew their relationship was progressing quickly, in a few weeks they'd gone from complete strangers to leaving keys under mats. It didn't feel rushed though; waking up next to Tommy felt natural, as though she'd been missing him all her life. Neither of them had talked about where they were going in the long-run, there was no use in looking too far into the future. Anyway, Katrina was having a hard time thinking any further ahead than three weeks when Tommy would get into the cage to fight Forrest Griffin. The bus came but Katrina got on in a daze. She'd told herself a thousand times not to worry about Tommy's fighting, he was a grown man, able to take care of himself. She could just about manage to hide her feeling when he came to her with bruises on his face and knuckles or welts the size of fists across his ribs. She was proud of him for how hard he trained, the hours he spent in the gym or on the roads running, all the same, she knew it would be a completely different matter when it came to watching him fight. A few nights ago she'd let curiosity outweigh her better judgment and looked up some of Tommy's fights on YouTube. It was a terrible decision. MMA didn't look anything like boxing or wrestling, the violence of these fights was really something else. She almost spilt her mug of tea down herself when she saw Tommy's dispatching his first opponent with one punch nearly breaking the man's neck. Other videos showed men whose noses were broken, lips split and bleeding. She knew that when Tommy started fighting again this would happen to him too, he'd be coming home to her with a lot more than a few bruises. Katrina didn't let her mind wander down that road, picturing broken bones and brain injuries, Tommy in the hospital. She knew how strong he was, how determined, that worried her more than anything, he was too hardheaded to back down. She sighed, imagining the worst never did anyone any favors so she settled deeper into her seat and tried to block out any more images of emergency rooms and the sound of broken bones by listening to Avicii remixes for the rest of the bus ride, her head bobbing along with the beat. The main studio was packed by the time Katrina slipped into the back, trying her hardest to be quiet. She joined the barre just behind Danni who shot her a quick smile before getting back to the warm-up. The day passed slowly, technical classes in the morning turning out to be just what she needed to get over the last of her hangover. Everyone was feeling rather flat after the excitement and heart-pumping adrenaline of the first night. Katrina noticed some of the dancers and stagehands in dark glasses and even caught Sonja napping during her break. When lunch rolled around no one could be bothered schlepping through the rain to the local café or even out to get sandwiches. They huddled around the vending machine and Katrina split a chocolate bar with Sonja. No one talked much, everyone was still pretty washed out after last night's excitement, and even Mark was looking a bit pale. \"Are you going off to practice after?\" asked Sonja through a mouth full of chocolate. \"Yeah, don't want to let last night be just a fluke.\" There were nods all around and one by one the dancers peeled themselves off the floor to go and practice their various parts. All except for Danni who didn't have a solo, Katrina shot her friend a sympathetic smile but wasn't sure if she saw it. Katrina wandered back to the locker rooms, still licking chocolate off her fingers. She shouldered her way into the room before digging around in her locker for the CD with her solo music. She found her phone in the search through her handbag and stared at it for a moment, working out a text to send back to Tommy. See you tonight X Short and sweet she thought with a smile. Maybe she would drag him into the shower this time. She shook her head, thoughts like that would only get her distracted. Fully distracted already, Katrina drifted back into the corridor with her CD and was almost flattened by two dancers coming in the opposite direction. By the blonde hair Katrina recognized one of them as Lauren, as they passed she caught a glimpse of the girl's tear-streaked face. What's going on now? She wondered. Most people had long since stopped trying to keep up with Lauren's temper tantrums, they were common enough in the studio what with the pressure of the new show weighing down on everyone. There was a strange silence in the halls as Katrina made her way to a small practice studio on the bottom corridor. Any dancers she passed were speaking in hushed tones, like children listening out for the strains of parents arguing. She shut the studio's door behind her, flopping onto the floor and tying on her pointe shoes, she had new ones today and so spent a few extra minutes flexing the soles and softening them with a little water. Satisfied at last she stood, stretched and pressed play on the stereo. The quivering string music started up at once and Katrina took a moment to listen. Fifteen minutes later and Katrina was stretched out on the floor, resting her feet for a moment, she rolled her ankle, feeling the bones move and click. The sound almost but not quite masked the sound of the door being opened, quiet as it was, Katrina heard it and sat up. Her boss, Daniel Kline sauntered in, his hands in his pockets. Katrina noticed a large gold wristwatch peeking out beneath the cuff of his shirtsleeve. He didn't speak for a long moment but stood looking at her with an oddly intense expression, evaluating and cold. She shivered, standing, wishing suddenly that she had a t-shirt on over her strappy leotard. As she stood, Daniel's trance seemed to break and a wide smile broke out over his tanned face. He shut the door. Katrina let herself into Tommy's flat; she only realized that her hands were shaking when it took her three tries to fit the key into the lock. Inside all was dark and quiet. She thought briefly of taking the bottle of whiskey from Tommy's cupboard and pouring four fingers into a glass, thinking better of it, she flopped down on the couch for a moment, hands over her face. She curled up into the arm of the couch, pulling a blanket over herself. The shivering worsened, more out of shock rather than fear or pain. Her upper arms were still throbbing where Daniels's hands had grasped her, dragging her towards him. She swallowed back disgust at the memory of his lips on hers, brief and brutal, tasting of cigarettes. She touched her mouth, feeling a cut lip where he'd bitten down on her. As she curled up further, burying her head in her arms. Shame gnawed at her, what had she been thinking? How had this gotten so far out of control? Her stomach churned, and she let out a low moan, which turned gradually into sobs. When she next opened her eyes the sky outside was dark, rain lashed against the windows of Tommy's apartment, wind rattling the glass in the frame. She needed to go, before Tommy came back and saw her like this. Quickly she slipped off the couch, wiping her eyes with her sleeve as she did so. She was just collecting her underwear from the counter and turning for the door when she heard a key in the lock. She froze for a moment before mentally shaking herself; she'd just have to brazen it out. Tommy stepped through the doorway, awkwardly carrying his kit bag in one hand. \"Katy?\" he asked, stopping short. \"Hi, I got your text…\" she held up the neatly folded bra and pants. \"Oh, right. It was pretty lonely waking up without you this mornin'.\" Tommy gave her a crooked smile. He started forward, dumping his kit bag on the floor with a thud. Next second he had his arms around her, so strong and sure that Katrina felt tears welling up again, she clung on to his shoulders, resting her head on his chest for a moment, breathing him in. Tommy's callused hand found her cheek, tipping her head back so he could kiss her and Katrina tensed for a moment before kissing him back. She drew back, flattening her palms on his chest so he wouldn't follow her. \"I should go- I have some things I need to do tonight.\" She didn't meet his eyes but she could still feel him looking down at her. \"Ah come on Katy,\" Tommy groaned, drawing her back to him. She relented, moving where he lead, and allowed Tommy to lay her down on the couch. His skin was cold, he'd obviously walked home from the gym, Katrina was vividly aware of every place that their bodies touched. Tommy's hands roamed over her back and felt her own fingers clutch involuntarily at his t-shirt in response. Katrina was struck by the casual intimacy of this moment; there was no rush, no nerves, nothing to prove. Tommy sat up, pulling her with him so that she was straddling his lap as he lifted her shirt over her head. \"Thought about you today,\" He said, his deep voice sending vibrations through the both of them. \"nearly got knocked out in in the ring 'cus of it.\" \"Am I that distracting?\" Katrina asked. \"Oh yeah,\" she felt him smile against her skin. Tommy's hands gently grasped her upper arms and Katrina suddenly gasped in pain as he squeezed down on the bruise that she hadn't realized was starting to form. \"You okay? Did I hurt you?\" Tommy looked up at her, blue grey eyes searching her face as though he could find the answer there. She shook her head, leaning down to kiss him again but Tommy gently pushed her back. \"Katy, what happened to your arm?\" \"It's nothing.\" \"Let me look?\" Tommy asked, quietly. She ducked down so he couldn't see her as well, \"It's fine.\" \"Look at me.\" He asked, she felt as much as heard him. \"I told you it's nothing.\" Katrina repeated, she didn't quite know why she was hiding this from him, instinct maybe, a sense of self-preservation. \"Don't look like nothing.\" \"I fell…\" the lie was out of her mouth before she could stop it and she saw immediately the look of disappointment on Tommy's face. He knew of course, knew immediately, and assumed the worst. He let her go, hands dropping to his sides. \"No you didn't.\" Something flickered behind his eyes. \"Tommy.\" A moment ago Katrina couldn't wait to get away but now she reached out towards him. Tommy wouldn't look at her, brushing her hand off his arm. She sighed, trying again, \"It's nothing Tommy I promise.\" He looked at her; eyes more grey than blue \"I never took you for a liar Katy.\" Katrina couldn't deny it and didn't try to. She moved away, sitting up and jumping off the couch, she heard Tommy stand behind her. For a moment he just stood there, and there was a silence except for the sound of their breathing. She jumped when he touched her shoulder. \"Come on Katy.\" Something in his voice pulled her up short, she turned but Tommy wasn't looking at her, his stared at the ground between them, his eyes somehow distant. He looked back, much more directly now and Katrina felt herself blush. She crossed her arms over her chest as though that would hide the mark on her skin. It didn't. Soundlessly, Tommy reached over and turned on the lamp beside the sofa, bathing them both in its orange glow as the filament warmed up. She felt Tommy tense and she looked down to see what he was seeing. There, imprinted just above her elbow, like blue ink on a white page, was the perfect shape of a man's hand. \"Jesus,\" Tommy breathed, taking her arm and pulling her farther into the circle of light so that he could see. He looked sharply up at her, the rage that often pulsed under his skin now flickering over his face. \"Is this what you call nothin'?\" Katrina shook her head, fighting down the urge to cry, standing in the light with Tommy looking at her hurt, for a reason she didn't understand. Shame, unexplained and unwarranted washed over her. She couldn't meet his eyes, not without crying, not without the whole sordid story coming out so she brushed past him, taking her things with her as she went for the door. He didn't try and stop her, move a muscle as she slid out into the corridor. As Katrina paused to collect herself in the hall she heard the crash of something being thrown across the room in the apartment behind the door. A/N: What do you think? Dramatique? Romantique? Crap tastique? University is starting to make me go slowly crazy and it's only the first week![Chapter 21] Chapter 21 February 25 th Tommy thought he was going to throw up. The sound of the door slamming echoed through the suddenly empty apartment. All at once the rage he'd tried so hard to control burst its banks and he hurled a glass from the kitchen counter across the room. \"Fuck!\" he said out loud, his heat hammering in his ears. \"Fuck!\" He stood in the living room, old feelings of helpless rage paralyzing him. All at once it was as though nothing had changed and he was a little boy again watching as his mother rubbing cream into the bruises on her face. He drew a long, shaky breath, he wasn't a kid anymore, there was something he could do about this, and he was going to do it. He started for the door, shrugging off his jacket as he went and letting it fall to the floor behind him. At times like this he wished he still had Manny to talk to, he was always the expert with women, wouldn't have made such an ass of himself as Tommy already had, and would know just how to fix it. Manny was always the calm one, whilst Tommy was the hothead, sometimes Tommy missed him more than he could stand, what he wouldn't give to be able to pick up the phone now and ask him what to do. Never mind that , he thought, already halfway up the stairs, you'll come up with something . Tommy took the stairs two at a time, his heart thudding against his ribs, palms going clammy with sweat. Several emotions seemed to battle at the forefront of his consciousness; the first- anger. Anger at himself, at his father, at his mother, at his brother, at Katrina for not trusting him with the truth but overwhelmingly at himself. What the fuck is wrong with me? Tommy asked himself in a rare moment of introspection. No answer was forthcoming, the truth was too mired in a childhood punctuated by arguments and beatings, and an adulthood that wasn't turning out any better. He paused for a moment outside Katrina's door. Just go in there and apologize , he told himself firmly. He knocked, for a long moment there was no answer, then there was a shuffling of feet. \"Hello?\" as voice asked and Tommy could hear the Katrina had been crying. \"It's me.\" He replied \"What do you want Tommy?\" Katrina asked flatly from the other side of the door. \"Can we… talk?\" Tommy asked. \"Go away Tommy I don't want to talk.\" \"I ain't leavin'.\" He replied, Tommy wasn't about to take no for an answer. \"Seriously Tommy what the fuck is your problem?\" Tommy winced, Katrina almost never swore and the words sounded harsher coning out of her mouth. \"Will you let me in, please?\" He heard a sigh, then the lock clicked and the door creaked open. Katrina stood on the other side, gazing warily up at him. Tommy noticed that she had put on a long-sleeved sweater, one of his, it swamped her completely, making her seem absurdly young and small. Tommy found that he couldn't meet her eyes, he took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry.\" The words hung in between them, filling the small space. \"Okay.\" \"Okay?\" Tommy asked. \"Let's talk.\" Katrina retreated into the apartment, laving Tommy to shut the door. She curled up on the couch, arms around her knees. Tommy sat opposite, not too close even though the only thing he wanted to do was put his arms around her and take her to bed. \"Tell me what happened.\" \"It's complicated.\" Sighed Katrina. \"No its not, someone hurt you, who was it?\" Katrina buried her face in her knees, long dark hair flopping forward. When she started to speak the words came out muffled. \"The director of PDC- Daniel Kline\" she paused, \"I don't know how it happened, one moment I was warming up in the studio and we were talking about the first night, the next moment.\" She shuddered, \"he was kissing me… holding me down. I just panicked because I slapped him. He didn't seem to mind though, just sort of laughed and left. I'm sorry.\" Tommy got off the couch, and knelt down in front her. \"Don't apologize, please don't.\" He murmured, pulling her to him until they were locked into an awkward sort of embrace. \"I shouldn't have been angry at you, I was bein' a jerk.\" He felt Katrina nod into his shoulder. When Tommy raised his head he found himself almost nose to nose with Katrina. His eyes drifted down to her lips and he noticed something he hadn't seen before. Under the bright lights of Katrina's apartment, Tommy could see that she had a split lower lip, red and swollen. Tommy felt all of the anger the he'd worked so hard to tame come rushing up to the surface. As though sensing this Katrina drew back away from him. \"He split your lip.\" Said Tommy quietly, trying hard to control the rage coursing through him. He could barely remember ever being so angry, suddenly Katrina was far too close, he needed to be away from her. \"Tommy?\" through the haze of rage, through the ringing in his ears and the strobe light of bad memories, he heard her voice, small and somewhat afraid. Then her hand touched his chest, he hadn't realized that they were standing. \"What?\" he asked. \"Calm down… please?\" He looked at her, at her big brown, worried eyes and pale, freckled cheeks and her full pink lips and felt the anger drain out of him as though someone had pulled a plug at his feet. He pulled her into him, kissing the top of her head, he needed to breathe, to collect himself, to be out of the searchlight of Katrina's gaze for a moment. That twinge in his chest that he'd started to feel the first time he'd came to suspect the he loved her, it was back again. Stronger now and more painful, a dull hollow, aching in his chest that only she could fill. She was warm and Tommy breathed her in, calm slowly returning, the red tinge clearing from his vision. They stayed like that for a long time, how long Tommy wasn't exactly sure. They didn't talk as he rubbed long slow circles across Katrina's back. Her warmth seeped into him, even though the thick sweater. Tommy knew he loved her now, he couldn't explain how or why but he didn't trouble himself much with the particulars, only love could be this painful and still be welcomed. As though seeing his future clearly for the first time, he saw the two decisions he could now make. He could still leave Katrina, tell her he wasn't cut out for relationships, lie to her, push her out of his life, dull this ache in a bottle of whiskey. He would spend all his time at the gym or with the guys. He would train longer hours, take on more shifts in the reception. He wouldn't take so many trips out to see Brendan and Tess at first, they'd want to know what had happened to Katrina, maybe they'd stop asking if he was rude enough. Eventually the pain would subside, as all pain did, like a wound finally scabbing over, blood clotting and skin knitting back together. He could heal if he walked away now, stopped twisting the knife, never kissed her touched her or spoke to her again. He couldn't do it. \"Tommy?\" Katrina's voice brought him back to himself. \"Yeah?\" \"Thank you.\" She rested her head on his chest. The words that had been going around in Tommy's head for what seemed the longest time, stuck in his throat on the way out. He didn't say anything, couldn't- so he settled for giving her another squeeze. After a long moment they drew apart and Tommy saw Katrina wiping her eyes with her sleeve when she thought he wasn't looking. \"Want a drink?\" she asked, a smile breaking out at last. He nodded and allowed Katrina to lead him into the tiny kitchen area, settling on a barstool to watch her fill the kettle as he had so many times before. In a minute they were settled back on the couch, mugs of tea in their hands; Tommy was finally getting used to the herbal stuff. Katrina flicked on the TV and started going through the channels, Tommy wrapped his free arm around her waist and she snuggled into him with a sigh. \"You okay?\" he asked after a moment. \"Yeah. Not exactly looking forward to work tomorrow.\" \"You don't have to go y'know.\" \"Yeah I do, but\" Katrina shrugged, \"I'll be okay\" Tommy resisted the urge to disagree, nodding blankly at the TV screen. \"You don't think so?\" Tommy shrugged, \"I just don't like to see you go back there… seeing that guy day after day…\" \"Its okay babe, I'll be fine.\" \"I think might come in and see this guy.\" \"Oh, Tommy no, I don't think so.\" \"What?\" \"Somehow I don't think you'd like jail very much.\" Tommy saw Katrina's smile out of the corner of his eye. He shrugged in acknowledgement. \"Probably not.\" And with that they would both have to be content. February 26th Tommy was half asleep when he felt Katrina slip out of bed in the morning, the fist fingers of light just starting the inexorable creep around the blinds and into the semi-darkness of her bedroom. He felt the side of his body that she'd been curled against start to cool and heard the muffled sounds of dressing. He allowed himself a moments more sleep before getting up and heading downstairs, pulling on boxers as he went. Katrina was almost out the door, jacket and scarf on, kit-bag slung over one shoulder. \"Hey.\" Tommy murmured, kissing her cheek. She wrapped her arms around him, leaning into him for a moment. \"Hey yourself. I'm about to go, are you working late tonight?\" Tommy had to think for a second. \"Yeah, I think Frank wants to take all the fighters out on for hill training…\" \"Better you then me\" Katrina laughed. Tommy waved one last time as she vanished out of the door a slight twinge of unease in his stomach. He didn't like to think of her going back to work with that man Daniel, not at all. He comforted himself however with the thought that if seeming were to happen, he knew where the man worked. Tommy privately thought he'd hold up fairly well in jail. Tommy killed time, he went for a run. Pushed him body around the park and over near to where Pop's house was, taking longer than usual. His breath was coming in short sharp gasps by the end of the eight-mile track, burning in his lungs. He left for the gym shortly after eleven, nothing going around in his head except for the thought that he needed to tell Katrina that he loved her and that he had no idea how to do that. Once at Frank's gym he had bigger concerns, the place was packed with casuals, the type of men who like to relive the glory days of high-school wrestling or semi-pro boxing, the type of men who worked nine to five on offices and spent their lonely or overwrought weekends listing to antiestablishment music from the nineties and trying to regain some semblance of manhood and street-cred. The kind of men, in short that Tommy despised. He tried to play nice, keep the annoyance at their unabashed hero-worship from the surface but on the whole he preferred to avoid them. He gave a cursory wave to Jay and the others over by the free weights before heading in to the changing rooms. Once there he collapsed on a bench, checking first that he a alone; the place was mercifully empty. He dialed Brendan and thankfully his brother picked up after the second ring. \"Tom?\" he heard Brendan's voice, slightly muffled by static. \"Yeah Bren it's me.\" \"What's up?\" Tommy hesitated for a moment before asking the question that'd been spinning around in his brain for a while now. \"Bren, when you were sixteen, how did you know that Tess was the one?\" There was a long pause, the crackle of phone line interference the only sound between the two brothers. \"I dunno… I guess\" Brendan sounded uncertain, \"I couldn't imagine it being anyone else, waking up next to any other girl, making big decisions, buying a house… I picked out the names for our kids y'know?\" \"Really?\" Tommy snorted, \"you were always such a girl…\" \"Fuck off.\" He could here the smile in Brendan's voice. \"Nah, man thanks…\" \"Is this about Katrina?\" Tommy nodded for a moment, before realizing that his brother wouldn't be able to hear that in Monroeville. \"Yeah… it is.\" \"Good choice brother.\" A/N Okay so this has been a long time coming and I know that Tommy is moving pretty fast but I feel like he's a bit of an all or nothing kind of guy? Thoughts? xxx[Chapter 22] Chapter 22 March 1st As it was a Wednesday, and there was no show on that night, Katrina got off work early. It had been a short day but intense, classes, conditioning and fittings for costumes all packed in with no time for a lunch break. The ever-present challenge of avoiding Daniel was also proving particularly wearing, the man was everywhere, watching classes with increasing regularity, loitering in halls talking to dancers, forcing Katrina to get pretty creative about her route to and from the dressing rooms. She sighed, taking the last of the bobby pins out of her hair and shaking it out of its net. He hadn't spoken to her since that night in the studio but occasionally she felt his eyes brushing over her body like wandering fingers and would glance up to meet those cool appraising eyes with a glare of her own. She couldn't be rude, couldn't complain, she needed this job and needed it badly to work out. \"What's up?\" asked Danni, appearing at her elbow, half in and half out of a leotard. \"Nothing,\" replied Katrina, \"just tired is all.\" She hadn't told anyone but Tommy what had happened between her and her boss, didn't really trust anyone to keep the secret well enough. Gossip would spread around the company like wildfire and then, well, then she could pack her bags and go straight back to Chicago. \"Sure?\" asked Danni, searching her face, \"you seem a little down recently.\" \"Really hon, its nothing, too many late nights, maybe you me and Sonja should have a girls night in?\" she forced herself to smile. Danni laughed, \"Good plan, can we watch Pretty Woman and eat Cheetos?\" \"Definitely, as long as there's chocolate I'll be happy.\" \"I'll hold you to it y'know.\" warned Danni, reaching for her phone to text Sonja about their plan, pink and green manicured nails flashing across the tiny buttons. Katrina said her goodbyes to her friends for the day before heading out of the dance center. Tired as she was, her spirits couldn't help but lift at the thought of her next stop for the day, she was getting her hair done. She did it exclusively for herself, Tommy had never noticed the subtle highlights and lowlights she had put in every few weeks, she doubted very much if he'd comment if she went and cut it all off. Still, she liked to look her best for him and for herself. The bell over the door of the salon tinkled as she let herself in, the place was quiet, the after work crowd having yet to roll in and the lady at the counter greeted her warmly. \"Hey, you must be Katrina right? Four o'clock?\" \"Yeah that's me.\" She replied. \"If you'd like to take a seat over there we'll be right with you.\" The receptionist flashed her a winning smile She hadn't been here before; the salon she usually went to had shut down after a rent-hike by the landlord. Overhearing Katrina complaining about the state of her highlights Sonja had recommended her own hairdresser, \"A gem\" she called it. Katrina sat in the waiting area, looking around. Everything was pristine and painted in varying shades of pink and purple, very girly, it was being stuck inside a box of violet creams. With highlights newly refreshed and her hair carefully washed and blow-dried, Katrina flipped to the back of the news paper as Laura, the hairdresser, started to hot-tong her hair perfectly straight. She skimmed past the football results and the racing pages until she was at the back of the sports section. Her eyes alighted on a short article about upcoming MMA fights in the Pittsburgh area and she felt her heart turn over as she spotted Tommy's name in print. A list of upcoming fights in Pittsburgh wouldn't be complete without mentioning the scheduled fight between Georgian ex-sheriff Forrest Griffin and local boy, military hero and Sparta finalist Tommy Conlon… We hope to see a return to form for Tommy Conlon after his tap-out to brother Brendan Conlon at the Sparta finals last June… Military hero? Katrina frowned slightly, Tommy had told her a few things about his time in the Marines but judging by the tone of this article there was a lot more to the story. That aside, she wondered when Tommy had planned to tell her that it had been Brendan who'd fought against him at the Sparta finals, she'd started to guess that after the argument between the two when they'd been over for dinner but all the same she'd have preferred to hear it from him. \"Everything alright mam?\" asked Laura, noticing Katrina's frown. \"Oh yeah, those highlights are coming out real nice, I was just reading this article.\" \"About the MMA?\" asked Laura, peeking over her shoulder, \"My boyfriend just loves that kind of stuff.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah, I got him tickets to go see Sparta last June with the guys, he was so excited that that Brendan guy won in the end.\" \"That's so sweet of you, so him and Tommy are really brothers?\" Katrina pried. \"Oh yeah, that Tommy guy was a real hero- deserted his unit in Afghanistan but then saved a bunch of guys out in the desert, ripped the door off of a tank they said.\" \"Ripped the door off a tank ?\" Katrina asked, mouth agape. \"Yeah, it was all over the news when the guys he saved recognized him from his fights and got on TV to thank him.\" Laura smiled, obviously happy to be imparting such thrilling knowledge and got back to her straightening. Katrina sat back in her chair, re-reading the article a few more times and sure enough there was a reference to the \"tank incident\" as the writer called it. In her minds eye she could see Tommy, in his uniform out in the desert, muscles straining and bulging as the wrestled with the tank to free those inside. She shook her head slightly, that was impossible, no one was strong enough to do that, were they? Well if anyone is, Tommy is , she thought. She remembered that time he'd given her a boost to get the tin of coffee of a top shelf, he'd picked her up as though she were a doll. This will be an interesting conversation for tonight… Katrina let herself into her flat a little after seven, her eyes itched with tiredness, back and legs ached but her hair was looking fantastic. Sonja had been right about the salon doing a good job. She threw her keys and handbag onto the table before kicking off her flats and switching on the main light. She started for a moment to see Tommy sprawled out across her couch, clearly fast asleep. His gym bag was next to the door. Katrina smiled slightly to herself, tiptoeing across the floor as not to wake him. It was no good; Tommy hadn't spent all that time in the Marines to be a heavy sleeper. \"Hey.\" He croaked, not opening his eyes. \"Hey yourself.\" Katrina replied, flopping on the arm of the couch with a sigh. \"Long day?\" Tommy asked, opening his eyes blearily and sitting up, Katrina notice that he had a freshly minted black eye. \"Yeah, long, but still fun.\" Tommy smiled, somewhat lopsidedly at that. \"Do you want some ice?\" Katrina asked. \"Ice?\" he replied, nonplussed. \"For your face?\" Tommy raised a hand to his eye, as though noticing it for the first time, he winced. \"Yeah, thanks.\" By the time Katrina had retrieved an icepack from the freezer Tommy was up and pacing, as he always did when indoors for too long. Katrina stepped into his path, bringing him up short. \"Sit down.\" He listened to her, flopping back on the couch. She iced the newly forming bruise spreading itself across his cheekbone, by tomorrow his eye could might well swell shut. \"What happened?\" Katrina asked, continuing in her ministrations. \"Was just a sparrin' match.\" Said Tommy, voice still gravelly from sleep. \"Did you win?\" \"Nah, big Niko knocked me out.\" \"Ah well… next time then.\" Tommy nodded in silence. \"How was your day?\" he asked at length. Katrina shrugged, \"long, conditioning class- rehearsal, notes and I got my hair done….\" She flipped it, L'Oreal style before glancing up. Tommy looked at her for a second and Katrina realized what he was really asking. \"Nothing happened- nothing okay?\" \"Okay.\" His brow furrowed, \"Are y'sure you don't want me to come down there, just to talk to this guy?\" Katrina shook her head, \"definitely not. I barely see him now, it was just a one off, I promise.\" Tommy seemed to consider this nodding to himself. \"Aight. I'll stay away then.\" He smiled slightly, \"your hair looks real pretty by the way.\" Suddenly Tommy stood, pulling her with him and wrapped his arms tightly around her waist hands spanning across her back. He kissed her, none too gently, as though he'd been waiting all day for this moment. They broke apart, gasping for air before Katrina reached down and grasped the hem of Tommy's t-shirt pulling it off over his head. He shivered slightly as her cold hands trailed up and down his chest. She caught sight of his cocky half smile before he was all over her again hands running up and down her back as he eased the skirt off her hips and started playing with the waistband of her tights. As heavenly as this was Katrina knew that there were things at hand to discuss. She pushed him back; it took some doing, the full force of her hands against his chest not registering for several moments. \"What is it Katy?\" Tommy asked. She sighed, not really wanting to do this but knowing it was unavoidable. \"Tommy when were you going to tell me about what happened when you were overseas?\" \"What?\" Tommy's eyes darkened. \"You ripped the door off a tank Tommy, you didn't think that was important to mention? That and the fact that Brendan was the guy who beat you in Sparta last year and broke your shoulder- here I was thinking Brendan was a physics teacher. \" Tommy slumped back down on the couch, his knee immediately began to bounce with pent-up energy and he stood up again. He sighed, running his hands through his hair distractedly. \"I wanted to tell you… its just…\" he broke of again and Katrina knew better than to rush him. She waited. \"I didn't know how.\" He shrugged, \"everything after Manny died, it's just a blur Katy, I hardly even remember getting in the river to save those guys.\" \"But you did do it.\" She said. \"Yeah. And then took off stateside.\" They sat there in silence for a long moment before Katrina asked, \"do you want to talk about it?\" Tommy looked up at her, forearms on his knees, classically defensive, shutting her out. \"Wouldn't know what to say.\" He mumbled at length. \"I didn't know Bren was goin' to be at Sparta until the day we both showed up. Another fighter dropped out… I was just, I dunno, didn't expect that, after all these years.\" She kissed his cheek, roughened as it was by a five o'clock shadow and he put an arm around her. The silence between them stretched, full of unanswered questions and half-truths. \"You still comin' to watch me fight?\" Tommy asked her. Katrina smiled slightly, he sounded so young and unsure when he asked her like that. \"Of course.\" And kissed him again. Afterwards, after what felt like a long, long time they lay together in the quiet, Katrina listening to the sound of Tommy's heart, strangely loud at close quarters. She traced random patterns over his skin, let her fingers find the tattoos, now so familiar to her and trace over them. He was asleep, or she though he was, chest rising and falling steadily, eyes moving behind pale lids. She shivered suddenly, it wasn't warm that was for sure and spring was slow to come in Pittsburgh. Tommy opened his eyes, \"cold?\" Katina nodded. \"Let's go to bed.\" Tommy stood, totally unselfconscious and held out a hand. Katrina stood and crossed her arms over her chest out of habit. Tommy looked down at her for a moment, expression softening. He raised his hands to her arms and gently pulled them down to her sides, his hands found her hips and he pulled her close for kiss. \"You ain't got nothin' to hide Katy.\" She smiled against his lips, hands finding his biceps and then sliding around his neck. Tommy pulled away from her for a moment, not meeting her eyes, being about eye level with his shoulders, Katrina could see the pulse in his neck pick up, thrumming urgently under the skin. \"What is it?\" she asked, her thumb tracing his jugular, his skin broke out in goose bumps under her fingers. He didn't answer for a moment, taking a deep breath then he looked up. Tommy cleared his throat nervously, ducking his head again. \"What Tommy?\" Katrina raised his chin. \"Nothin'… just nothin'\" He said, voice very low. Katy saw a dull flush colour his cheeks, she smiled, \"Okay then.\"[Chapter 23] Chapter 23. March 9th Tommy slept in the morning of his fight, it wasn't until that night and Frank had given him the day off from work to rest. He sat up, stretching. Katrina and he had spent the night apart, she had been performing didn't want him to stay up for her night after night. It was strange to him how long it took to fall asleep alone these days, nightmares reaching him far more readily without Katrina's warm presence beside him. As the echo of gunfire and screams jerked him out of sleep, he felt himself reaching for her but his hands clasped only empty sheets. He sighed, sitting up and stretching, his neck cracked in a satisfying way and he ambled down to the kitchen. As he put the kettle on to boil Tommy checked his phone, rubbing his thumb absent-mindedly over the crack in the screen. There were two messages, one from Katrina and one from Brendan, he saved them both for later, being a strong believer that if something was ever urgent, people would find the time to call. As it always had been before a fight, Tommy felt himself withdrawing from the world, into the bubble. Other fighters liked to go out the night before, listen to music, get pumped up to meet their opponents, but not Tommy. He remembered Pop understanding this, how he'd kept the locker room quiet at Sparta, any talking to a minimum, had Tommy run familiar drills again and again or simply prepared in silence. This had always been their routine, since Tommy's wrestling days when Pop had pulled him out of school days before any match, to get him into the zone. Sometimes Tommy couldn't help but wonder if he would have made it to the Olympics. Caught up by a sudden rush of rare nostalgia he tore off a sheet of paper from the pad he kept by the landline and rustled up a pen. Tommy vs. Theognis he wrote laboriously, a quick copy of the poster still had hanging in his childhood bedroom. He doodled a small picture of the legendary wrester on the margin of the page, hands held high in victory, his drawing skills certainly hadn't improved since grade school. He snorted, feeling foolish but smiling to himself. He counted up his lifetime of fights in his head, high-school scrimmages when some unwise bully picked on the new kid, scuffling with boys in the trailer park where he and his mother had finally settled. There had been bar brawls, too many to count, a fight with Manny on the first day of basic training that landed them doing endless drills where they had become firm friends. The pen tore the page at that last memory and Tommy set it down, a task for another morning. After a quick breakfast Tommy went for a run, rugging up against the cold in track-pants and his favorite black beanie. He hadn't meant to go far, just a quick jog but his feet had other ideas, bringing him all the way around the park and up towards the Manchester neighborhood, closer to his father's house. Before he knew it he was standing in the weed-choked front yard, Pop's car, still up on blocks, covered with a dustsheet. With no one at home the place was looking more dilapidated than usual, he noticed that the porch was starting to sag on one side, the cold of winter having weakened the supports underneath. He hesitated for a moment before loping up the steps and fishing a spare key out of a plant-pot by the door. Before he knew what he was doing, the door was open and he was inside. The place was tidier than when Brendan and he had gone to see their father, dishes were no longer piled into the sink; the empty scotch and beer bottles had long since disappeared from the counter-tops and kitchen table. Dust had settled in his father's absence, coating everything in a fine grey film. Tommy wiped it from the framed family pictures, already yellowing with age. He paused by the mantle-piece, there was a new photograph amongst the old, unframed and propped up against Brendan and Tess's wedding photo. He looked closer, surprised to see that the picture was of himself, in full dress blues, sitting apprehensively in front of that mottled-blue background of a mall-photographer's studio. Tommy remembered having this taken, just before his third tour of duty. Pilar had wanted a picture of Manny in uniform for her mantle-piece and Manny in turn had dragged Tommy off with him to get it done. He looked younger somehow, still boyish with hope and excitement. Of course that was before the tour had come to its awful conclusion, before all Pilar had left of her husband was that photograph and a folded flag. He wondered if she still kept it above the mantelpiece in New Mexico, he hadn't seen her since before he left. Tommy frowned, where had this picture come from? He certainly didn't remember keeping a copy, maybe Pilar had sent it? Shaking his head Tommy set the picture back where he'd found it and turned to leave, locking the door on his way out. Tommy swung by the apartment, staying just long enough to pack his kit-bag and neck down a protein-shake, he'd always hated the taste. He threw the sports bottle into the sink, he'd do the washing up later, and headed for the door. The rest of the afternoon was lost inside his own head, getting ready for the fight. He'd always had a knack for disappearing within himself and he practiced it now, doing endless reps at the gym not talking to anybody. At exactly five o'clock he got bored of waiting, curtly declining Frank's offer of a lift to the fight he trudged up the street to the bus stop that would take him into the center of the city near Whitehall. He took a seat at the back, one knee bouncing in time to the turning over of the engine as the old bus lumbered up the road. It was almost five thirty by the time Tommy got to the downtown center of the city and to the Hilton hotel located there. He was early but already a throng had started to form around the doors, people milling about, camera crews unloading rigs and equipment from the back of trucks. Frank had already given him his information pack, security lanyard and all the rest. Tommy fished it out of his duffle bag and put it in his jacket pocket, then, pulling his hood up, he walked briskly around the crowd and through a side entrance, down into the bowls of the Hilton's underground parking. It wasn't a particularly dignified entrance to his first fight but Tommy would do anything to avoid the inevitable throng of admirers if he was recognized. Thankfully he'd kept a low enough profile since leaving the military that he wasn't instantly recognizable to most people, even truly die-hard MMA fans. He hadn't posed for any pictures at Sparta, and skipped the press conference. Even after the fight, when reporters had swarmed around he and Brendan like flies, no one had managed to get a decent shot of the two of them together. He bounced on his heels, shadow-boxing for a moment in the elevator ride up to the second floor where the fighters were being checked in. The hall was already a hive of activity, there were three rounds to this tournament, and a number of fighters had turned up early to miss the crush, inadvertently creating a crowd of their own making. Attendants, organizers, trainers and entourages milled about, all getting in each other's way. Tommy couldn't see Frank although he knew that the man must be here now, having driven. He cast about, searching fruitlessly, his eyes did however catch on a flash of bright red, he looked closer, flash of red disappeared into the throng for a moment before reappearing, a handbag. Katrina's handbag to be exact, Tommy had seen it enough times slung over the back of a chair or over his girlfriend's freckled shoulder. Tommy weaved through the mass of people, following her, he kept his hood up, hoping to escape people's notice. He could see her clearly now, in black jeans and that oversized denim jacket she always wore when it got cold. She certainly cut a different figure to the girls milling around the place, dressed up to the nines, all long bleach-blond hair and Malibu tans. Katrina reached behind her and fluffed up her hair, a movement so familiar to him now that he smiled in spite of himself, hurrying to catch up with her. The most beautiful girl in the room without even tryin' he thought. He caught her hand, the one that wasn't holding her fire-truck red handbag that was, and she whirled around with a gasp. \"Hey stranger.\" Tommy chuckled, \"what are you doin' here so early?\" Katrina smiled giving his hand a squeeze, \"I sent you a text this morning, told you I was coming?\" \"Oh, sorry, I didn' check my phone.\" Katrina shook her head, rolling her eyes in exasperation, \"you pay that phone bill for a reason Tommy.\" \"Okay okay.\" Tommy shrugged, conceding the point and glancing around for Frank. \"I gotta go find Frank and sign in.\" he told her, drawing an arm around her to protect her from a particularly large group of people squeezing their way past. As they past, Katrina squeezed into his side and Tommy felt the now familiar ache in his chest at her touch. It occurred to him then that having Katrina around for the hours before his fight might not be the best thing for his concentration. He didn't know how to tell her this though so settled for silence. Before long, Tommy spotted Frank, over by one of the sponsorship tables, deep in conversation. He looked up and, spotting Tommy his prematurely lined face broke into a wide smile. \"The man of the moment! Come on over Tommy.\" A little way off, Tommy could see Midnight Lee, newly representing Frank's gym signing autographs and chatting with fans. \"Hi, I'm Katrina, you must be Frank.\" Tommy stood back and let his trainer and his girlfriend make their introductions. He couldn't be sure if he'd ever mentioned Katrina to Frank directly but he was sure that Brendan had filled his best friend in on all the details, as Frank didn't seem at all surprised to see Tommy with a girl. \"Frank\" His trainer introduced himself with a smile, shaking Katrina's hand before turning back to Tommy. \"Have you signed in yet?\" he asked. Tommy shook his head. \"The desk's over there,\" Frank pointed. \"I'll wait.\" Said Katrina, giving Tommy a little nudge to get him going and he ambled off. Tommy hoped that Frank could come up with some half-way decent answers to the questions Katrina was surely asking him about the coming fight. They hadn't spoken much about his upcoming bout and Tommy always avoided her questions, not wanting her to worry. Tommy loitered at the back of a large entourage surrounding some fighter or another, from the thick southern accents and number of men sporting Sherriff's stars Tommy realized with a start that the thickset man signing paperwork ahead of him was his competition for the night. He skulked, there was no other word for it, waiting as form upon form were signed and Forrest Griffin's hangers on had had their fill of flirting with the small army of dolled-up secretaries on offer. He made his way to the front. \"Hi, can I help you?\" asked the receptionist behind the desk, smiling up at him. \"Yeah I'm here to sign in…\" she looked perplexed for a moment. \"To fight.\" He clarified. The young woman's very well groomed eyebrows disappeared under her fringe. \"And who…?\" They both knew it would be rude of her to ask who he was. Realizing he was being unhelpful, Tommy pushed back his hood and took of his beanie, \"Tommy Conlon.\" Eyes widened even further the receptionist rifled through the catalog of bouts, searching for his picture, not finding it she asked for his ID. He gave it, lanyard, key card, info-pack and all. \"Okay Mister Conlon,\" the ready smile was back, \"I just have these forms for you to sign.\" She handed over a small pile of safety wavers and insurance disclaimers along with a pen. Tommy got to signing, the too-narrow pen slipping occasionally in his callused fingers. As he worked his way through the forms Tommy became gradually aware of people looking at him, recognizing him. A crowd was forming around the desk, where people were slowing down to look at him, the back of his neck prickled but he pushed the feeling away, retreating into his pre-fight bubble. Forms signed, Tommy crossed the conference room, it was much fuller now as VIP guests flooded in, dressed up and taking pictures with grinning, trash-talking fighters. He found his way back to Frank, deep in conversation with a man in a dark grey business suit. Tommy noticed the regimental tiepin and straight-backed manner, reflexively; he rolled his own shoulders back. Frank beckoned him over, \"Tommy, this is Kyle Harrington, sponsorship rep for Dodge.\" Kyle Harrington stuck out a hand and Tommy shook it. \"Where did?\" he asked, but Frank beat him to it. \"Got a phone call\" Tommy nodded. He would have preferred to keep Katrina close but restrained himself from looking around to find her. \"So,\" Kyle began, \"we have a few basic plans.\" Frank let Kyle talk for a good five minutes, laying out the benefits of various sponsorship plans, Tommy was impressed with the money they were prepared to offer, thinking of Pilar and his as-yet-unfulfilled promise to her. At the end of the man's spiel however he was rather taken aback to be presented with quite such a large stack of information packs. Frank took them, bantering with Kyle about \"getting the jump on all his best fighters.\" Tommy realized that the two men must be friends and was thankful to Frank for not hawking him around every sponsor he could find, even though it was in his interest as Tommy's manager. \"Time to get ready?\" Frank asked. Tommy nodded, pulling out his phone and sending Katrina a quick text to say where he'd gone. Then, finally, he scooped up his kit-bag and escaped the bustling hall, descending into the relative calm of the bowls of the hotel. They soon reached his dressing room, just one corridor behind the main room, which was set up with rows of seats, bedecked with TV-recording equipment and papered with the scowling posters of fighters. Tommy set down his bag and cracked his neck, preparing for a long wait, he and Griffin wouldn't the first to take to the cage that night. \"Don't get too comfortable,\" warned Frank, loosening his tie a notch, \"there's a press-conference soon- did you bring a shirt?\" \"No?\" Frank sighed, \"You have to go you know, give an interview, let people take some pictures.\" Tommy shrugged \"never done it before,\" thinking of Sparta. \"I know, but this is how you make the money out of fighting, you can't live of your winnings, not unless you want to work the smokers and strip-club parking lot bouts.\" Tommy had to crack a slight smile at that \"Okay, okay-\" he tugged off his hoodie, shivering slightly at the chill. Underneath he had on just a plain t-shirt, for some reason he'd chosen camo-green that afternoon. \"You'll do.\" Said Frank, taking off his tie all together with visible relief. \"What d'you want me to say in the interview?\" asked Tommy, refusing to show any nerves. \"Just answer the questions, reporters on the MMA circuit are used to dealing with fighters who've had one too many to the head so there'll be no hard questions.\" Tommy nodded, mulling it over. \"Ready to go?\" asked Frank. Nope thought Tommy, tucking Manny's dog-tags, worn for luck, under his shirt before following Frank out the door. Tommy joined the throng back in the conference room, looking around as he did so for Katrina, she must be around somewhere, he thought, scanning the crowd. Frank propelled him up to the front where, behind a long table sat the fighters and their managers. They had to fight thorough the journalists, tv-crews and excited fans to get there, wending around camera rigs and ducking under sound booms. Not wanting to draw attention to himself, Tommy took his seat at the very end of the table, gazing nervously over the crowd. Not even in Sparta had been up in front of such a crowd. Then he'd had the luxury of anonymity, skipping the press conference and skirting the cameras. The journalists immediately started taking pictures of the newcomer, a thrill running around the room at the infamous Tommy Conlon finally stepping into the limelight. Tommy forced himself to sit still, not fidget around in his pockets for a toothpick or just straight up walk out of there, he clenched and unclenched his fists, waiting the flashing of cameras to stop and the barrage of questions to begin. Finding himself with six microphones pointing his way, Tommy looked to Frank for guidance. \"Start on the left.\" His trainer advised, and Tommy nodded wordlessly at the outermost microphone. The first few questions went by hesitantly, not planning ahead for anything but the upcoming fight its self, Tommy hadn't prepared any kind of answers. He mumbled out a few things about training at Frank's gym, living in Pittsburgh how much weight he was lifting and how many reps he could do. Any personal questions he simply ignored, the press could speculate about his private life on their own time. Aware of his composed discomfort Frank nodded along to all his answers elaborating here and there whenever Tommy looked to be about to dry up all together. Finally, it was over and the fighters, trainers and entourages started to get up and leave, people swarmed around Tommy again, reporters, photographers, sponsors and well-heeled VIPs. Tommy attempted to wend his way through the throng but it was no good, waylaid and asked for pictures, signatures, and quotes, the door was looking further and further away. Suddenly, he felt a hand on his own started slightly, looking down he saw Katrina, smiling up at him. He put an arm around her, not wanting her to get swept into the crowd around them and cameras flashed left and right like lightening strikes. The ducked away and Frank left them to it, indicating \"five minutes\" on his fingers. \"Hey.\" Mumbled Tommy, finally weaving past the last few people and making it to the elevators. \"Hey yourself.\" She replied, \"You did amazing up there.\" \"Thanks.\" Tommy felt himself flush slightly. Tommy had an hour before his scheduled fight, he started to get into the zone again, composing himself. Endless press-ups and shadow boxing in the quiet of the changing room cleared his head. Occasionally Frank would pop in making sure he had everything that he needed, water, towels, quizzing him about his walk-out song. Tommy hadn't chosen one and, in keeping with his style at Sparta, he wasn't planning to. Katrina watched him, mostly in silence, perched cross-legged on the dressing room table, handbag on her lap. If he hadn't been so wrapped up in his oncoming bout Tommy might have noticed how white her knuckles were, clasped around the handle of her bag or how pale and quiet she was. As it was, he didn't. At quarter to, when the last of the commentary from the previous bout was drawing to a close, Tommy started to wrap up his hands. He hadn't realized how was nervous he was until Katrina had to help him with the task. \"Thanks.\" Tommy mumbled. She smiled, winding the bandages around his knuckles in the same pattern as she used for her feet before dancing before securing the ends with a long strip of sports tape. Frank was out of the room again, talking to the crowd of people milling around outside, Tommy had asked not to have anyone in the dressing room pre-fight. He caught her eye as she finished wrestling with the tape, smiling slightly, his first real smile of the day. It would be so easy to lean in and kiss her but, just as that thought was coming to the forefront of Tommy's mind, someone knocked on the door before entering, they sprang apart, both slightly sheepish. It was Brendan, very windswept and red-faced from the cold outside. \"Tommy.\" Brendan came over and hugged his younger brother slapping him on the back. \"How are ya?\" He asked. Tommy shrugged, \"Gonna be a long fight. Griffin probably thinks he's got my number.\" Brendan grinned, \"Well this will come as a nasty surprise to him then.\" Tommy nodded, wordlessly, hoping that all the hours in the ring against Niko and Frank's relentless insistence on new fighting styles and techniques would be enough to give him the upper hand now that he wasn't the proverbial \"biggest fish\". Even when given free reign by Frank to bulk up his meals and weights to his heart's desire and even given Katrina's regular home-cooked dinners, Tommy's weight loss at Camp George was still telling. In diversifying his fighting style he was working around the issue, playing to his new strengths but in the back of his mind he still wondered if that would be enough to compensate for the loss of his old ones. \"Come on Tommy,\" it was Frank, back from placating reporters desperate for a pre-fight interview, \"time to get this show on the road.\" \"I'm going to get to my seat, good luck.\" Katrina said softly, giving his hand a quick squeeze. Frank and Brendan became suddenly very interested packing away bandages, weights and water bottles. Tommy took their momentary inattention as a cue and kissed her on the cheek. She blushed, smiling and slipped out, Tommy felt his heart flip-flop around in his chest for a moment before quashing the feeling- it was time to focus on the task at hand. Even bracing himself for the noise, Tommy was hard-pushed to appear immune to the uproar as he entered the hall. He was walking out second and had already heard the bag-pipe and heavy-metal thrashings of Forrest Griffin's walkout song, \"I'm shipping up to Boston\" reverberating around the dressing room. It didn't intimidate him at this point though, Tommy was in the bubble- totally focused. The singing of marines however, took him by surprise, just as in Sparta a whole section of the crowd was decked out in kaki and insignia, roaring out the Marines' Hymn. Unbidden, Tommy felt his heart swell with pride as he stood at attention on the steps of the cage, acknowledging his comrades before stepping inside. He caught the sound of the cage being locked shut behind him over the final \"ooh-rah!\", before all noise faded into the background and he finally got a good look at his opponent. Forrest Griffin, the ex-sheriff turned MMA light-heavyweight, was taller than Tommy at six foot three but their builds were well matched. Tommy's eyes tracked his every movement as Griffin warmed up a little, stretching his neck and arms and bouncing on the balls of his feet. Time stood still inside the cage as the cheers died down and the commentators had their final say. The referee beckoned the two men to within handshake distance. \"Alright gentlemen, I want to see a clean fight, obey my commands at all times\" Tommy nodded, \"defend yourselves at all times, touch gloves move back-\" The two fighters briefly bumped fists before stepping back. As their eyes met Tommy saw his own determination reflected back from his competitor. He really thinks he's going to win this Tommy though, cracking his neck as the shrill bell echoed around the cage, no chance mate. A/N We're back! A massive thank you to everyone who reads/follows/story alerts/ reviews- you guys inspire me to write! xxx[Chapter 24] March 9th Katrina The starting bell rang and the crowd roared it's approval and the two fighters in the ring sprang at each other. Tommy came out swinging, forcing Griffin against the chain-link fence almost immediately, raining punches onto the man's ribs and face. Vaguely Katrina recognized her own voice amongst the baying of the crowd around her. Suddenly the fighters were down on the mat, Griffin on top using Tommy's old technique- the ground and pound. Katina counted five times the man's fist made bone-crunching contact with Tommy's face and chest before Tommy rolled them over and had Griffin in a hold. The roar of the crowd increased as the two men thrashed on the mat and Katrina could see blood running freely down Tommy's cheek, her stomach clenched, roiling. The wrestling hold didn't last and all of a sudden the fighters were breaking apart, springing up to their feet. Tommy was shaking his head as though trying to get water out of his ears. The fighters reengaged, arms grappling, Tommy finding purchase on Griffin's neck and forcing his head down, swinging a knee up to connect with his face. The sound of bones crunching made Katrina's stomach clench and the two men sprang apart. Having both drawn blood the boxers seemed to find some equilibrium, circling each other, both looking for an opening. Just as they both prepared to leap at each other again the bell rang to signal the end of the round. Katrina watched Tommy retreat to his side of the ring, Frank dashing over to give him water and wipe the blood off his face. The two men exchanged words, heads bowed together; Frank straightened up and slapped Tommy on the back as he jumped to his feet, hopping from one foot to the other and cricking his neck. The next round was, even more fiercely contested. Forrest Griffin managed to get Tommy up against the fence early in the round, getting in several punches before Tommy twisted away taking the taller man down to the mat, arms locked around his neck. Katrina could see Griffin's face, bright red, slowly turn purple as his oxygen was cut off, his eyes glazing over. Then he twisted, gasping and staggered to his feet, kicking out at Tommy as he scrambled up. The two fighters circled like sharks; there was blood in the water now. The huge digital clock on the wall counted down the seconds until then end of the round in red illuminated numbers. Katrina watched the resolve harden in Tommy's eyes; this fight wasn't going to a third bout. He rounded on Griffin, hitting him with a right hook. Griffin hit back but Tommy was ready for him, dodging and countering with his left. The muscles in his back tensed and flexed as he rained a barrage of punches down on his opponent. Without realizing it Katrina was on her feet with the rest of the crowd, hands pressed to her mouth. The sounds of bone hitting bone jolted her again as the two men in the ring went on trading punches as though in a bar brawl. Both trainers were on the sidelines bellowing words of encouragement and behind them the final ten seconds of the round were ticking to a close. Caught on the nose by one of Tommy's right hooks, Forrest Griffin staggered and Tommy, seeing his chance, pounced, dragging the taller man to the ground. Tommy seized onto Griffin's arm, twisting it as he dug one knee into his spine; Katrina could hear the bones grinding and Griffin's short howl of agony before he tapped. It was over, punch-drunk with relief Katrina watched, dazed as the referee pushed the fighters apart and Frank Campanna vaulted over the fence and into the ring swiftly followed by Brendan. Tommy's arm was lifted high in victory, chest heaving and skin running with sweat and blood as he embraced his brother and trainer. Katrina found she could breathe again, gasping and dragging her shaking hands through her hair. She couldn't take her eyes off him, pride swelling in her chest as Tommy shook hands with the referee and a long-faced Forrest Griffin, even exchanging seemingly civil words. The crowd around her turned, and she with it as the group of men made their way down the tunnel and out through the double doors at the end of the hall, the last strains of the Marine's Hymn echoing after them. After a moment's hesitation she gathered her self up and slid out of her seat and into the crush. Weaving around the mass of people going the opposite way she elbowed her way to the doors going down the to locker rooms and used the pass Tommy had given her to get past the curious security guard. On the other side of the double doors she could hear the heavy thud of music and see people spilling out of Tommy's room, some in suits, others clearly fighters and even a fair number of scantily-clad groupies. The locker room was packed with people all intent on congratulating Tommy and Frank so Katrina waited, hovering at the door. A group of incoming reporters brushed by her, pushing her more fully into the locker room and Tommy spotted her, catching her eye and waving. He looked pretty good Katrina noticed, despite the rapidly developing black eye. She skirted around the edge of the crowd towards him and Tommy reached out to take her hand. He curled around her protectively, kissing her cheek with split lips. \"Oh Tommy no!\" she squirmed away, wiping her face but he just grinned at her and pulled her into a sweaty hug. \"I won.\" He said, as though he could hardly believe it. \"I'm so proud of you.\" Tommy smiled and leaned in for a kiss, he hesitated for a moment, frowning, then straightened up and spat a tooth out into his palm. \"Seriously Tommy?\" He shrugged, turning to his trainer Frank to get the medic to come back and Katrina saw him grimace as he swallowed the blood filing his mouth. He squeezed her hand quickly as the medic arrived to take a look at his mouth, tipping his head back and pressing the tooth back into place. As Tommy was occupied Katrina took the chance to cast about the room. When she did so she realized that a good percentage of the people were staring back at her, a few people had their phones raised and she realized that people were probably photographing her and Tommy together. She blushed, looking at her feet. \"Hey,\" Brendan popped up at her shoulder beaming. \"He did well didn't he?\" she smiled up at him, pleased to see a friendly face. \"He did amazing, half the people in here are sponsors and scouts.\" He squeezed her shoulder briefly before moving off to talk to one of the men in suits hanging around the edges of the room. Katrina was just about to go and see how Tommy, still spitting blood, was doing, when a woman in a well-tailored blue suit blocked her path. \"Hello!\" the woman introduced herself cheerily as Sharron and stuck out a hand for Katrina to shake. Before she knew what was going on a beaming Sharron was peppering her with questions. \"How long have you known Tommy Conlan?\" she asked, taking an iPhone from her jacket pocket to record. \"Errm,\" Katrina glanced helplessly over at Brendan and Tommy, both of whom were otherwise engaged. \"A few months…\" \"And can you give us any juicy details about him, the man's a mystery and my readers love an insider's perspective.\" Katrina frowned at her; the woman's smile didn't quite reach her eyes, which were rather cold and calculating. \"Sorry no, I've got nothing to say…\" She backed away, wrapping her denim jacket more firmly around her for protection as she went to check on Tommy. He smiled as she approached, front tooth missing now and as Katrina sat down next to him she could feel the collective weight of the reporter's eyes following her. Tommy followed her gaze and grimaced, motioning to have Frank come over. \"Do you think we could get some of these people outta here?\" he asked \"Of course man, it's your show\" Slowly the room around them emptied, reporters and hangers on returning to the main hall to watch the next fight. People kept coming up to Tommy to congratulate him and Katrina was impressed at how he was handling all the attention, calm and polite. Finally, after the last sponsorship reps were persuaded to leave and Brendan dragged Frank under the pretense of watching the next fight, they were alone. \"How's the tooth?\" she asked. Tommy grimaced, spitting it out. \"I can afford to pay for a fake one now.\" Katrina shook her head boys she thought in exasperation, when will they learn . Silence stretched between them, outside was the muffled roar of the crowd and the shrill bell as one round of a fight ended. Tommy shivered, Katrina could see the sweat rapidly cooling on his skin. \"Cold?\" \"Yeah.\" She got up and fetched the black hoodie he wore so much from a nearby table, when she turned back he standing. Tommy reached for her and Katrina stepped easily into his embrace. \"You did so amazing out there-\" \"Thanks, I saw you, when I was in the cage…\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah it was… it was nice, you cheering for me\" he smiled down at her, the look in his grey eyes was doing something funny to her heart, surely it wasn't meant to beat that fast. She rose up on her toes and kissed him, feeling the space behind his lips left by his front tooth. His hands wound around her waist, gently squeezing. Katrina sighed contentedly, breaking the kiss with a smile. \"I'll always be cheering for you.\" She whispered into the space between them and felt, rather than heard Tommy chuckle, his laughter vibrating from his chest into hers. \"thanks.\" \"I mean it.\" She said with a further smile, dropping a quick kiss onto his collarbone, the highest point on his body she could reach on her tip-toes without him bending down. Tommy took her face between his hands, she could feel the calluses left from months in the weight room, graze against her cheeks. Tommy seemed to be searching her face, as though looking for something. \"What?\" Katrina asked, blushing under his scrutiny. Tommy didn't answer for a moment, looking down, then to her. \"I love you.\" He whispered, letting go of her all of a sudden and stepping away. The cold air rolled in, replacing the place where their bodies had touched. She reached out for him, grabbing his hand, holding tight. It took a surprising amount of her strength to pull him back, he wouldn't look at her as she wrapped one arm around his back, not letting go of his hand. \"I love you too Tommy Conlon.\" Still kissing when Frank and Brendan returned to the room, banging the door loudly on their way in, the two of them sprang apart like guilty teenagers at the sound of their knowing laughter.

It was early morning, pale sunshine refracting around the empty gym through the high windows, making the space seem cold despite the late summer warmth that lay languid in the streets. While it was tolerable now, the heat would quickly begin to build as the gym filled, and so he chose to get his sessions done early in the morning and late at night. Plus, it was easier to zone out and fall into the cadence of his own movements when he was alone. Currently, the only other person in the building was Colt, the manager. Tommy had expected to be dropped when he lost the title at Sparta but it seemed that Colt wasn't ready to give up on him just yet. Despite the odds, the pair had struck up a relatively stable friendship, something that Tommy usually wasn't very good at. Though he'd lost the competition, Colt didn't want him to run off to another gym and so was eager to keep Tommy's attention - and loyalty - which is from where the discussion of 'income' had sprung. Throughout the entire ordeal, Tommy's intention had been one thing and one thing only: victory. Thus he had forgone sponsors and interviews, which meant he had also forgone profit. While some cash had come in due to it all being televised and Colt being able to talk the talk, the whole thing had left Tommy with little more than a dislocated shoulder and an empty wallet. So, when he had been released from hospital, Colt had been quick to pull him aside and start talking income. In return for Tommy keeping the gym clean, acting as spotter when required, and manning the front desk, a weekly wage would appear in his account every month, keeping things ticking over. It wasn't much but in the world that he lived in, Tommy was grateful for every cent Colt spared him. Aside from the money, having a reason to get up and out of the house in the morning, and something to think about other than, well, anything else, was a relief. Sparta had been more mentally challenging than physically and the maelstrom of thoughts it had triggered weren't as quick to go as they had been to appear. Fires that he had believed to have been smothered out years ago flared up, burning just as strong if not stronger than the first time around, old wounds tearing open to bleed just as fresh. Since he had been fourteen years old, Tommy had carried around a casket of conflict and by stepping in front of the camera - and his brother - it had been thrown open for the world to see; and while he supposed that the silver lining at the bottom of unleashing such a Pandora's box unto himself was the chance to have his brother back in his life, he couldn't deny that Conlon men had one defining trait: abandonment. When Brendan had held him tight after that fight, breaking and remaking him simultaneously, Tommy had clutched onto the whispered promises with a child's hope that maybe it was going to be okay. That he had lost the fight but he had won so much more, and the two men that had meant everything to him only to be lost were suddenly there again, flawed but present, and that took him higher than any morphine the doctor could prescribe. He allowed himself to remember the fairytales his mother told him as a kid, that love conquered all, and all sins could be forgiven. And so, together, the two brothers had walked away from the cage. Brendan's strength had encased him the way it had when he was just a boy, and Tommy wept for the path his life had taken. When the doctors took him into surgery, Brendan promised him that he would be there when he got back and Tommy believed him. As he'd faded into oblivion, he'd seen a fragile catharsis hang above his head like a halo and he'd thought that this was - finally - the end of him. When he woke in the hospital bed, he heard rather than saw Brendan outside the door. It didn't take Tommy long to work out that his brother was speaking to his wife, and as he'd blinked away the remnants of sleep, he realised that it hadn't been catharsis hanging above him after all but rather the collision of time. After going so long without even acknowledging the existence of a brother, the missed years of their lives had met, warped and imploded inside the cage, all with an audience as witness. They'd tried to play catch up but you can't miss out half the book and expect to continue the story. No, there was no catharsis here; the tragedy played on. Still, Brendan tried, Tommy had to give him that much. He sat by his bed for over a week, handing out apologies with every meal, pleading for his baby brother to understand why he'd had to leave him all those years ago. He spoke of his daughters, his wife, his family 2.0 and Tommy could only count down the days until Brendan would leave, afraid that the antiseptic of the place would leak into his wallet and bleach the faces of his loved ones away. Brendan was sorry but he did not regret, and what kind of person would Tommy be if he expected him to? He knew better than most that you could not wish away a family, even a bad one. Thus Tommy forced himself to shoulder the pain. He took Brendan's apologies and ate his hospital food like a good patient, and he made himself numb. Not that he could do much else: his blood had turned to sand a long time ago, and no amount of holy water tears could bring him salvation now. On that last day, Brendan gave his final apology, his breath rattling through his lungs like old pennies. Tommy accepted it wordlessly, wondering whether being blown to pieces with his unit would have hurt less than this. Still, when Brendan hugged him close, Tommy held on for dear life, sending a choppy prayer to whoever the fuck was listening that this would be it. That he had paid his dues, that he had collected enough demons to satisfy the devil and that this would be it. Whether or not it was answered was something only time would tell. When Brendan dropped him outside Paddy's little home, Brendan told him that he was going to donate a percentage of his winnings from the fight to Pillar and her family, in honour of Manny. There was little Tommy could say to that accept a tight-throat thank you, for it didn't matter whose bank it came from, as long as those beautiful children could have the life and opportunities they deserved. And as Brendan drove away, promising his little brother that there would always be a place for him at his table, Tommy told himself that he was okay to always be the one left behind. The walk from the ring to the hospital bed was long enough; second best was good enough. Time passed, as it does. It took about twelve weeks of physical therapy for Tommy's shoulder to finally start to get back to normal and he hit the gym as soon as he was able. During those few months, Tommy tried to keep out of the path of his father as much as possible, the pair of them caught in the steps of an awkward dance that moved from one extreme to the other with no grey area in sight. They spoke the language of coffee and long silences, never quite looking each other in the eye but trying not to avoid each other to the state of blatancy. When the sun was bright, they would attempt to settle into the mould of any dynamic they could: father and son, trainer and fighter, but the suit never quite fit. Thing was, the fundamental parts of their existence hadn't changed, nor, perhaps more importantly, had they been addressed and as such it was hard to shake the feel of what they had once been: abuser and survivor. That atmosphere was another reason why Tommy was grateful as hell to have a certified excuse to be out of the house: even his Pop couldn't argue with him leaving to go to work. Plus, it allowed him to train when he wanted which kept him in shape, and with the guys that worked out there having already known him before Sparta, it allowed him to keep his head down. Occasionally a passerby would stare at him or a fan would come into the gym but his ferocity and the lack of communication he'd had with the media gave him a large enough buffer to avoid any publicity, though the one or two letters he'd had from viewers were sweet enough that he kept them in his bedside table. Which brings us back to now. Tommy threw his last punch just as the clock struck nine and began to unwrap his knuckles, enjoying the small comfort in regime. Knowing the doors would be opening soon to the regulars, he quickly hit the showers, appreciative of the hot water as it soothed his muscles. Afterwards, he dressed in silence before walking out to take his place at the front desk, anticipating the cool breeze from the AC to probably be the best part of his day. He nodded his greeting to those that walked by and pulled out a pile of membership applications that he was hoping would take up the rest of the morning to process. With only the sound of abused punching bags to distract him from his own thoughts, the creak of the door sounded too loud in his ears and he sharply looked up, realising only then it was approaching midday. He was surprised to see a young woman, perhaps in her mid twenties, barking a goodbye down her cellphone as she stepped into the gym, bringing in a wave of heat from the outside. Sighing, she dropped a satchel down by one of the waiting chairs then headed over to where he was sat. Tommy looked her up and down as she approached, not recognising her at all. He wondered whether she was a fan but there was a hardness in the lines of her face that made him think otherwise. \"Can I help you?\" he asked, watching her. Tiny beads of sweat lined her forehead and her mascara was smudged under her eyes from the heat, enhancing the shadows lurking there. \"Er, is Colt here?\" She had an accent but it was the exhaustion in her voice that Tommy heard, and it took him a second to register her question. \"Name?\" \"Harley Sinclair. He knows me.\" Her tone was dismissive, her body turned away from him as if she would rather be somewhere else. Tommy thought about asking what she was here for but decided he didn't actually care. Instead he got up and told Colt he had a visitor. As the two greeted each other, he told himself he was only listening in on them because there was nothing else to do. \"I thought you were gonna be here yesterday,\" Colt said, holding the girl at arm's length to give her an appraising look. She just shrugged, her eyes darting over to Tommy for a tiny second, her face devoid of emotion. \"Things took longer than I expected. You still okay for me to crash at yours?\" \"Yeah, 'course.\" Colt's tone was softer than Tommy had ever heard it and when he pulled the girl in for a hug, Tommy thought that maybe he should make it less obvious that he was watching them. \"Take as long as you need,\" he said before checking his watch. \"I've got to make some calls. Gimme twenty minutes and I'll take you round. That okay?\" \"Sure,\" the girl - Harley, Tommy remembered - said, moving to take a seat, visibly uncomfortable with being left alone. She took out her phone, unlocking it then locking it again without actually looking at it. After a few more rounds of this, Tommy cleared his throat. \"Do you need anythin'?\" he asked her, trying to be polite. Harley put down her phone and sent him a smile, tucking a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear. When she shook her head, Tommy decided to busy himself with more paperwork, not wanting to waste more time staring at some random girl. Soon enough, Colt reappeared and ushered Harley out of the gym, calling over his shoulder that he'd be back later. As the girl closed the door behind her, she sent Tommy another warm smile and he couldn't help but return it. By the time Colt returned, the gym was empty and Tommy was stashing away his gloves in his locker having finished his late night workout. His manager was leaning against the front desk when he walked out. \"You alright, man?\" he asked. Colt shrugged and ran a hand over his bald head. \"Yeah, I'm good. Just had some late nights, that's all.\" There was a pause and then Tommy found himself asking the question before he even realised he was going to. \"Who was that girl?\" Colt gave a short laugh, shaking his head. \"The daughter of an old friend,\" he replied vaguely and Tommy leant against the wall, raising his eyebrows at his boss until he continued. \"I was friends with her mom when we were kids. Now I think about it, Lily lived not that far from your old man's place.\" \"She looked rough, man,\" Tommy said, recalling her face: gaunt, pale, dark circles under her eyes. \"I know. I got her some food though and then she practically passed out on the coach. Runnin' on fumes, as always.\" Colt looked like he was gonna say more but then turned away. \"Right, I've got some business to tie up then I'm out. I'll see ya tomorrow?\" Tommy nodded and headed out with a goodbye. When he got home, the smell of coffee hit him hard and he could hear the Moby Dick audiotape coming from his father's bedroom, which meant that it was a tough night for his Pop. Tommy hesitated outside his door, knowing that a good son would go in and see if he was okay but then he decided that bad fathers don't get the luxury of good sons, and so he climbed the stairs, undressed and fell unceremoniously into bed. The sound of muffled voices coming from downstairs reminded him of being a boy with a family again, and he drifted off into darkness, not awake but never quite asleep.

He stopped in his tracks, taken aback at how ordinary a sight it was, and he dared to wonder whether she had been sat there every day and he had just never noticed. When she glanced up, the force of those bright green eyes made him look away and he busied himself with collecting the equipment cupboard keys until he no longer felt her stare. It was early in the morning, not even gone seven, so Tommy was confused as to why the woman was there in the first place. Colt was in but had already locked himself away in his office so there was absolutely nothing for her to do unless she wanted to kit up and go work out, which didn't seem very likely. As he went to the set up the equipment, the forever grumpy part of him snidely hoped that he wouldn't be expected to babysit the girl during his shift. When he returned to the front desk, he saw that Harley had thrown away her magazine and was now sat staring out of the window with a distant look. She was perfectly still like a renaissance painting, and even from where he was standing, Tommy could see the weight of exhaustion pulling at her shoulders and for the smallest of moments, he felt like he knew her. But then the moment passed and he shook his head, moving past her to open the door - it was too damn hot - and it was then that Harley decided she'd had enough of the silence. \"Tommy, right?\" He nodded but didn't look at her. \"Have you known Colt for long?\" A weak ice breaker but he decided to humour her, and shrugged. \"Not really. Half a year, give or take.\" \"Oh, right. So, are you fighter too?\" Tommy couldn't help but glance over, surprised - and so fuckin' relieved - that she didn't know him. Not that he was that arrogant, it was just refreshing to be a blank page. He nodded and she seemed to appraise him, looking him up and down, which made him decide to take his turn. \"You from England?\" \"Mhmm,\" she hummed, a strange look flashing across her face. \"What brings ya here?\" he asked innocently enough, and was taken aback by the sudden harshness of of her gaze. \"My mum wanted to see the States again,\" she replied after a long pause, the words forced through gritted teeth. There was a warning there, bright within her tone, and though he thought it unnecessary, Tommy heeded it nevertheless. Then, not wanting to carry on a conversation that all of a sudden had rules, he turned his back on the girl and disappeared into the main hall to begin his work out. Harley watched him go, the stony expression fading into a small smile. Interesting . Later, when Tommy returned from his workout, hair damp and muscles warm, Harley was nowhere to be seen. Colt mentioned in the midst of a conversation that she had gone to visit her mom but before he had time to even soak in the words, his manager was pushing into the ring. A new fighter had joined the gym the week before and was all talk. While he'd held his own against some of the others, Colt wanted to see how he fared against a real fighter. The man was out cold within forty seconds and Tommy stared down at the limp body impassively, not invested enough in the fight for it to have stirred any unbidden emotion. He stepped out of the ring, wondering only a little bit whether he'd always feel this cold. The day passed; it always did. Brendan called during the evening and Paddy handed him the house phone with hands that were steadier than they had ever been despite his relapse a few months prior. Sparing a grunt to express his gratitude, Tommy grabbed the phone and lay back on his old bed, staring up at the same ceiling he had stared up at as a child. Brendan's hesitation was tangible but Tommy didn't help him, remaining silent as he waited for his brother to speak. \"Tommy... how are you, man?\" Not perfect but it did the trick. \"Fine, you?\" \"Good, man, I'm good. Er, I'm phoning to ask you something, actually. We were wondering whether you wanted to come visit for a few days?\" Tommy stiffened and his voice was rough when he replied, asking for a timeframe. \"Oh, er, not until October. Just wanted to give you a heads up. It's, um, it's -\" Tommy cut off his stalling, already knowing what he was going to say. \"It's your birthday.\" \"Yeah.\" Brendan sounded surprised and relieved as if he had expected Tommy to have forgotten his own brother's birthday. Tommy held back a scoff of contempt; as if he had forgotten a single thing about his older brother - not a single thing. \"I don't know, man,\" he began, ready to turn down the offer. It felt too forced, like Brendan was only making the effort out of guilt. Though, he supposed, what else was there in their family if not guilt? \"Just think about it, okay? You've got a month or two to think about it. I would really appreciate it if you came, Tommy.\" There was an undeniable note of pleading in his brother's voice that made Tommy wince. No matter how much resentment he had for Brendan, he couldn't just flat out refuse him when he sounded like that. \"I'll think about it,\" he acquiesced, rubbing a hand over his eyes, and Brendan's sigh of relief meant more to him that he would ever know. \"Great, man. I'll talk to you later, okay?\" They said their goodbyes and Tommy found himself once again alone in the dark of his childhood bedroom. It was barely big enough for him and he had contemplated the idea of moving his and his brother's old beds together but when it came down to it, he couldn't fathom moving anything around. He was afraid that if he touched it, it would just collapse into ash and sand. He looked around him and was again hit by the horrible realisation that the empty bedroom and the crowded gym were all he had. His time was split between the two places, both of them just a necessity. Both of them full of anger stemming from the same things, both of them with the same beginning and ending. Before that room he'd had the Marines - and before that, he'd had that room. That room inside that house which had been built with dysfunction and broken whiskey bottles, shot glasses lined up on the kitchen windowsill like fairy lights. Tommy lay in his bed, his hand over his eyes and he thought that there had to be something else, something other than those four walls and the lingering promise of regret. It was over a week later when Tommy next saw Harley. It was nearly lunch time when she came through the door of the gym carrying too many bags as she talked to someone on the phone that was caught between her ear and her shoulder. He could see the handles of the bags digging into her pale skin but she didn't seem bothered as she traipsed across the foyer, laughing down the phone with more energy than she'd had before. Still, Tommy got up and took most of her bags, his lips twitching at the corners when she gave him a beaming smile of thanks. She quickly hung up the phone and shoved it into her pocket. \"What's with all the stuff?\" he asked her. \"Colt asked me to pick up some things, though at the time I didn't realise 'some things' constituted an entire shop. I also brought some food since he was being grumpy.\" She lifted one of the bags Tommy had left her with and it didn't take long for the aroma of whatever was in it to hit him. Harley pushed into Colt's office without knocking and dropped the bag in front of him, rolling her eyes as he immediately began digging through it. He quickly found a burger with all the sides and didn't even look up before he started shoving it into his mouth. It was like he was a starving child and Tommy watched him eat like a wild dog with a raised eyebrow. Harley saw his expression and laughed, grabbing the bag again. \"Jesus, don't choke,\" she said to Colt who just gave her the finger. Harley rolled her eyes and left the office, Tommy moving out of her way as she went to put the bag on his desk. \"Here, come get some food.\" Unable to resist the smell, Tommy shot her as he went to check out what was on offer. There was chicken salad, seafood paella and some kind of steak fajita that was overstuffed with roasted vegetables. At Tommy's questioning look, she explained. \"I assumed you fighters would be as pernickety about food as dancers are, so I just grabbed whatever looked the healthiest. There was a party where my mum's staying and they had loads of leftovers. Help yourself.\" Shooting her a grin, Tommy pulled up a spare chair for the girl and they sat down together in comfortable silence, delving into their meal with enthusiasm. It tasted as good as it smelled and soon enough the other gym patrons began to drift towards them. Seemingly ignorant of their stares, Harley threw some napkins their way, gesturing with a wave of her hand to tuck in. It was only when she slipped into Colt's office to grab some water did the questions Tommy had been anticipating started. \"Dude, who's the chick?\" asked Dennis, one of the regulars. Tommy shrugged, not really knowing the answer, and looked over his shoulder as if he could see her through the office door. \"She's a friend of Colt - s'all I know.\" \"Damn, she's a bit young for ol' Colt!\" Mad Dog exclaimed, the others chuckling. \"Don't blame him though - did you see her ass?\" The laughter diminished just a little bit and Grimes glanced up at Tommy, pleased to see the disdainful expression. It was always fun for him to wind up the competition, especially when it was so easy to do. \"Lay off,\" Tommy grunted, pushing away from the desk just as Harley returned, her car keys in hand. Mad Dog stood up straight and shot her his best smile, giving her a little wink when she caught his eye. \"What dya say, sweetheart?\" he asked, looking her up and down in one slow, obvious movement. Harley raised an eyebrow, cocking her hip a little as she waited for him to get to the point. \"Wanna try a real fighter?\" Harley's expression was comical as she frowned, feigning confusion. \"I thought a real fighter was supposed to win their fights?\" The glint in her eye was mischievous as the others howled in laughter, slapping Mad Dog on the back as he shrugged nonchalantly, shaking off the dig, though he couldn't hide the tiny bloom of pink that tinged his cheeks. Not able to look either Harley or Tommy in the eye, he loudly changed the subject and ushered his gym mates back into the main hall, eager to move past the little scene. Tommy couldn't help but grin at his retreat. \"Your mom always did say you were a sarcastic little bitch,\" Colt called from his office, prompting Harley to snort as she headed to the door. With a wave of her hand, she disappeared down the road. \"Can't quite figure 'er out,\" Tommy mused as he handed his boss some documents to sign. Colt sighed then laughed a little to himself. \"Tell me about it. I only met her once when she was a toddler but even then she had been a fiesty lil' thing. I can see a lot of her mom in her, too. \" His tone had turned thoughtful, inward, and Tommy paused, staring hard at his own hands. Unable to stop them - and not quite wanting to - he was hit by the memories of his own mother, cancer-riddled, coughing up blood, and mumbling broken words as she cried herself to sleep; cold sweats and chunks of hair on the pillow. Tommy felt a surge of empathy for the girl. \"Is that why she's staying with you?\" Even to his own ears, Tommy's voice was cracked and rough. If Colt heard it, he didn't show it. \"Yeah. Her mom is at one of those psychiatric places for the moment so she's tryin' to find a place for both of them to stay to avoid rackin' up more costs. I felt I owed it to Lily - she saved my ass many a time back in the day. It's a shame how she's turned out.\" He sighed and stepped away, hiding the concern in his expression with an offhand shrug. When Tommy headed back to the front desk, Colt closed the door behind him with a firm click. Tommy stared at the wood panels for a long moment, wondering how many stories were hidden away in that office, wrapped around his desk lamp like an old power cord, and whether his was one of them. No matter what time Harley pulled up to the hospital, it was always full of hovering relatives with grim, confused expressions. People didn't understand their own brains and they certainly didn't have a clue about anyone else's, especially when they worked in different ways. The nurse at the station just waved Harley in as she approached, a sign of how often she'd been hanging around the place in the short time since she'd arrived. After exchanging quick pleasantries with her, she ventured off to her mother's room. Painted birds and flowers followed her path, creating an almost eerie sense of forced joy. When she got to the room, she saw that the curtains had been drawn, allowing the patient to sleep undisturbed. Harley let out a sigh: her mum always seemed to be asleep when she came to visit, no matter what time of the day it was. The nurse said it was a mix of her medication and general weariness, nothing to be concerned about, but Harley couldn't help worrying. Then again, her mother's lucid periods had been getting few and far between before they'd arrived in Pittsburgh, so perhaps it was a good thing after all. \"Hi, mum,\" she whispered, tiptoeing around to the visitor's chair. The slumbering woman looked quite peaceful, her long mahogany hair draped across the pillows like Sleeping Beauty, her body relaxed and still. The resemblance between mother and daugther was uncanny, sharing the same green eyes, pale skin, plump lips. But where Harley was strong, Lily was fragile, life and love having ground away at her for too long, wearing her down to nothing but fear. Once the lively beauty, here she was, wasting away in a psychiatric ward. \"Don't worry,\" Harley told her, taking her hand. \"You'll be out of here soon. I've got some places to look at this week, I'm sure one of them will be perfect. It will just be the two of us; I can sing for you, like I used to, and I'll look after you. You'll be okay, mum. I promise.\" Her eyes blurred for a second but she blinked away the tears, not wanting to cry. Things could be worse, she told herself. She didn't stay long, unable to stomach the sympathetic looks for more than a couple hours. When she walked through the doors, she let out a deep sigh, trying to force all the tension to leave her body. It didn't work, but hey, it's the thought that counts. It was funny how things changed. Her mum had been begging for them to return to the States for years, having grown up there, but Harley had hesitated, nervous of how much it would cost to not have free healthcare at her disposal - not that they provided much for the type of care her mother needed. Still, Lily had been adamant, wanting to see the city where she'd spent her childhood, and so here they were, their life savings draining away almost as quickly as her mother's sanity. Plus, it didn't hurt that she had Tommy to stare at during the day. That face paired with that fighter physique? She didn't think it could get better than that but then they'd started interacting and it turned out that he was nice too - something that was hard to come by in any four corners of the world. But here, in Pittsburgh of all places, she'd stumbled across Tommy Conlon and she had to admit, she was finding herself becoming more intrigued with the man each time. Quiet but not shy, there was something under the surface that had caught her eye, and she wanted to see more. He was a hard man, not through training or some hypermasculinity kick - life had made him that way. He carried his experiences like tattoos, an expanse of artwork that detailed his history. When she'd questioned Colt about who he was, he'd just brushed off her queries and told her to talk to him herself. That kind of protectiveness was rare for him, which made her all the more curious. So, when she turned up at the gym the next day and Colt wasn't there, she didn't hesitate to approach Tommy instead. \"Since Colt isn't here to take me to lunch and I have no idea where to eat in this town, how'd you fancy taking me instead?\" She gave him her sweetest smile but when she saw the shutter draw behind his grey eyes, she immediately back-tracked. \"You don't have to if you don't want to, don't worry about it.\" She stepped back, intent on leaving the gym as swiftly as possible so she could berate herself in private, but then for a reason unbeknownst to her, the hardness in Tommy's eyes twisted into something softer. He grabbed his wallet and stood up, swiping up his jacket in the other hand. \"Sure, I can do lunch.\" While Harley stared at him in disbelief, he called through to the others to let them know that he was going out and the desk was unmanned, before the two of them walked out together. \"There's an alright diner just two blocks over from here.\" \"That sounds great,\" she said, perhaps a touch too enthusiastically. She hadn't done this sort of thing in so long and despite never being one to lose her cool before, she was rusty with social interaction outside of healthcare professionals. \"Thanks for coming with me. I know it's probably not what you wanted to do for your lunch,\" she said, making sure to keep her voice at socially acceptable enthusiasm levels. \"I just get lost so easily around here and Colt is awful with directions.\" Tommy chuckled softly. \"I'm havin' lunch with a pretty woman at somewhere that ain't the gym. I think I'm okay.\" Harley blushed but didn't look away when she grinned at him, appreciating the small tidbit of humour. He had his hands tucked into his pockets and his head was dipped slightly, his shoulders hunched, but when he smiled at her it was the most beautiful thing she had seen all day. When they got to the diner, they were sat at a booth and they both studied their menus in silence. Harley looked all the options and sighed: everything looked so good. Still, when the waitress came to take her order, she picked the first thing she saw and went with it, plus some water. Tommy ordered his meal and soon they had no excuse for silence. \"So, how long you stayin' in the 'Burgh?\" he asked her. Harley bit the inside of her cheek and fiddled with the corner of the menu, and Tommy instantly understood that there was more to that question that he might have thought. Harley thought about how she should answer, because 'until my mum dies' was probably not a suitable response inside a family diner. \"Depends,\" she finally replied and Tommy nodded, sensing not to push it. \"You been here long?\" she asked in return and Tommy scoffed, looking away. \"Born here. Got out for a bit but now I'm back,\" he answered, not hiding the obvious fact that he wasn't happy about it. \"Got out how?\" \"Joined the Marines.\" His voice was low and cautious, and Harley sat back to study him, thinking that he definitely suited the role. Perhaps that was the reason why he had all that pent up anger just festering beneath the surface; those who knew death had sorrow, but those who well versed in dying knew anger. Harley wondered how many times Tommy had died. \"Oh, right. Is it like a family thing, or?\" she asked, recalling the male tradition of an old friend's family back home. \"As soon as I could, I joined,\" Tommy told her, his voice quiet, wary. Harley could tell they were treading dangerous waters for the both of them and this made her lips quirk into a strange sort of smile, because this wasn't how socialisation or lunch dates were meant to go. Her elbows were on the table and she swirled the ice around in her water, staring blindly at the glass in her hand. There was a long moment of silence and it was Tommy who broke it. \"What brings ya here, then? I doubt it's for a vacation.\" The absurdity of it being a holiday for her made her snort in derision and Tommy's lips pulled up into a cold smirk because he knew that feeling well. \"Definitely not a holiday.\" She paused before continuing on with a gentle shrug. \"My mum was born here, she would always talk about this city. Apparently I've been here before but I was too young, I can't remember it. Anyway, she's been wanting to come back here for a couple of years now and with the way everything is going, I just thought now was the time.\" \"Yeah, Colt, er, Colt said your Ma was sick.\" The unease in his posture, the gentleness in his tone, the compassion in his grey eyes, it was enough to stop her from being irritated at the intrusion. Not that she would normally mind but talking about her mum always made her think things she'd rather not. \"Mmm, yeah. The hospital she's at is meant to be one of the best in the country for her type of illness but they say there's not much more they can do. I've come all this way, paid all this money, just to be back at square one. I don't really know what I was expecting.\" She sighed, disheartened, and Tommy didn't know what to say next. Luckily, the waitress appeared with their food, providing them with a decent distraction. \"Sorry, this isn't really lunch talk,\" Harley apologised after a couple of bites, forcing a small laugh. Tommy just smiled at her, hoping it seemed natural. \"It's fine. I get it, don't worry.\" Without having to explain, Harley had no doubt that he did. The rest of the meal was spent talking about menial things and enjoying their food, taking it slow. Despite the awkwardness of their unsteady conversations, they ended up spending over two hours sat in the booth, reaching a level of comfort with each other that allowed them to laugh and smile at the small things. It was a reprieve that neither of them got the chance to have often, and they took advantage of it. Harley said goodbye to him outside the gym and Tommy watched as she climbed into her car with an innate grace that only came from someone who had been trained to be hyperaware of their body. He waited until she had driven off before going back into the building. As he threw his jacket over the chair and sat himself down at the desk, he thought about Harley and how, despite the eggshells that had been generously littered around their booth, he had enjoyed himself - and that was so unexpected, so out of the ordinary, that just for a second he wasn't angry anymore. This chapter was rewritten on 8 February 2016. The quote is from the poem collection Crush by Richard Siken. xo[Chapter 3] REWRITE THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) oh, when will you start believing there are monsters beneath your bed and all the voices of self-destruction don't begin inside your head - 3 - After the success of her lunch with Tommy, Harley took it upon herself to declare their ice officially broken and started to sit with him whenever she visited the gym. It wasn't often but whenever she did turn up, Colt would pointedly close his office door, clearly desperate for some 'alone time' since she was still crashing at his place, so she was grateful that Tommy didn't seem to mind. More often than not, it was early morning when Harley would arrive so they would sit together at the front desk, filing the paperwork and making small talk until Tommy began his workout. It took her a week or two before Harley gathered the confidence to venture in after Tommy when he disappeared into the main hall. Not that she was particularly nervous around people but she wasn't keen on answering the inevitable questions that are asking during introductions. Everyone always asked her what had brought her to the States and even the thought of piecing together a polite response was exhausting. Still, most of the other patrons recognised her by now so except for a few curious looks and offhand smiles, they didn't really acknowledge her presence. Pleased, Harley adjusted to her slowly expanding environment and took to sitting ringside to watch the fights. While Harley thought her presence went unnoticed, Tommy quickly picked up on the way a few of the fighters, mainly the young amateurs, would change the way they held themselves when she sat herself down on the bench. The distraction caused them to lose their form and they became sloppy, something that was exasperating for Colt but hilarious for everyone else. \"Focus on your opponent, not her ass!\" Colt would shout if he thought that their gaze was drifting. Harley would blush, the others would laugh; the whole thing quickly became a friendly routine, allowing her to settle down. Every so often as the fights went on, she found herself looking round the room for Tommy, oddly reassured when she spied him at the punching bags or lifting weights. A few times she caught his eye and he would shoot her a bemused smile, making her turn away quickly, hiding a grin. When she wasn't watching the fights, Harley would flip through newspaper after newspaper, circling potential accommodation with a thick black pen. It was mostly just to pass the time as she wasn't technically allowed to take up permanent residence due to being on the VWP but it couldn't hurt to look, right? Her mum was so desperate to stay in Pittsburgh and if she got her way, it would mean finding somewhere to live as it would be unreasonable to assume she could stay at Colt's for any longer than she had to - it was bad enough already and it had only been a couple of weeks. Thing was, finding somewhere to live would also mean finding some way to make money - which was conveniently another no-no on the VWP list. That in itself was a pain because between a full time student and her dance classes, the only money she had was the small amount she'd saved when working her weekend job back home, and those funds were very quickly diminishing thanks to the hefty hospital bill her mum was wracking up. To think, all the wishing and dreaming Lily had done about returning to the States, and all she'd done so far was lie in a bed - a very expensive bed. Harley asked herself every day what was the point in spending all that money and coming all that way just to move her from one hospital to another, but what could she do. All she wanted was for her mum to be happy, and despite the drugs and the bills, she did seem to be calmer in the city where she'd grown up. Better memories here, Harley supposed. Anyway, whatever the outcome was, Harley would need to make a plan. Her mum could stay in the States as long as she wanted thanks to the wonders of dual nationality, but Harley only had ninety days on the clock and a lot of restrictions on top of that. If she was going to stay there for that whole time, she needed to be smart. Hey, who needed to eat, right? It was just then that Tommy sat himself down next to her on the bench, jolting Harley up from the newspaper and out of her thoughts. When she glanced up at him, she found herself staring directly at his shirtless chest, still damp from his shower. Her eyes followed the dark aggressive lines of the myriad of tattoos that covered most of the skin she could see seemed to swirl and slash in an almost bitter fashion. Numbers and words and images that together hinted at a story that she had no right to guess at but was suddenly desperate to know. Her fingers twitched and she raised her hand without thinking before becoming painfully aware that Tommy was staring at her, paused in the middle of towel drying his hair, expression cautious and uncomfortable. Embarrassed, Harley sent him a sheepish smile before lowering her hand back down into her lap. \"Er, what?\" Tommy rolled his eyes and carried on drying his hair as he repeated his question. \"What you lookin' at?\" It took Harley a couple seconds before she realised that he was referring to the newspaper and not her little spaced out session. She sighed, her distraction over, and put the paper on the bench. She felt hot spots of exhaustion burn in her shoulders and absentmindedly rubbed at them. \"Nothing really. Planning for a future that probably won't happen - and even if it did, I'm not sure I could afford it anyway,\" she said it with a half-hearted laugh. Tommy threw his towel into one of the laundry bins by the door and began to pull on his t-shirt. \"Don't you have someone to help you out? Siblings, father, friends? … A partner?\" Tommy cringed at the way he'd asked that last part, the awkward hopefulness that had somehow slipped into his voice, surprising even him. It wasn't like he cared, right? Right. \"Nope.\" Luckily Harley didn't seem to notice his weird tone, or if she did, she didn't show it, and Tommy relaxed a little. \"It's fine, I'll work it out. I always do.\" It was obvious that she was trying to sound confident but to Tommy, the forced resignation clinging to each word was as clear as day. He'd said the same thing in the same way many times in his life, and watching this girl try to shrug away whatever it was that she was carrying was like looking into the past. It was unsettling and he shifted in his seat, clearing his throat to dislodge the bizarre feeling that had come over him. \"You'll be okay,\" he murmured without meaning to, and it came out like a promise. \"So will you,\" she replied as she stood up, and the smile she shot him was radiant. Sunlight streamed through the windows and speared the ground where she walked, glancing off her hair like water, shrouding her in a pale glow. It was as if she was a ghost spun of gold, gliding through his wasteland of spent glory and unspent dreams. Watching her then, it dawned on him that the strangeness he was feeling was familiarity. He didn't know this woman but he knew the story she was writing: he'd written the same damn one years ago. He didn't realise he'd gotten to his feet until he was stood behind her in the foyer. He said nothing but she knew he was there, and when she turned to face him, her expression was in such contrast to the regal straight of her spine that he took a step towards her without thinking - and then he was there and she was there, breaching space and thought with a stranger's intimacy. There was intrigue and something akin to shame in the woodland of her eyes. \"Who are you?\" she whispered, conflict clouding her gaze. When she spoke next, her breathing was quick as if they had been chasing each other for miles. \"I feel like I know you. You hardly speak but I want to tell you everything, my story hanging on the tip of my tongue just with one look from you because I feel like you'd understand-\" She abruptly cut herself off and snapped her head to the side. A blush darkened her cheeks and when she stepped back, there was a learned submission to her stance. Tommy realised that she felt she had spoken out of turn and expected to be punished for it. Standing there, he could see their story typed out in the tense tendons of her graceful neck, in the bruises awning his knuckles. He heard an echo of a scream in the fogs of his memory and he knew that while his story was over, her ink wasn't yet dry. Fuck, he thought, and closed the distance between them. Harley expected a reaction from him and so he allowed himself to react, and never once did he regret it. Tommy had to duck his head to press his lips to hers and he was struck by the push and pull of drowning and flying at the same time. Harley tensed but didn't move away and he took that as permission to knot his calloused hand in her wild hair, the other pressing at her waist to pull her body to his. There was roughness in his grip but his kiss was gentle; and when he pulled back to gauge her reaction, it was she who brought him back to her with a fierceness that he had already come to expect. Fire was left in the wake of where her fingers lay and each breath that fanned across his cheeks was gilt. \"Mmm,\" Harley hummed when they parted and Tommy looked down at her with a lopsided smile she hadn't seen before. She could feel the thrum of his heartbeat beneath her palm where it rested on his chest and it suddenly hit home what had just happened. \"What was that?\" she found herself asking. \"Your story.\" He caught her hand, held it. \"I don't know who you are, Harley,\" he said quietly, \"but for once in a long time, I think I wanna find out.\" \"I think I want to let you,\" she whispered, biting her lip with a belated shyness. Tommy smiled and he hadn't smiled so much in one day since Manny had been alive, but maybe that was okay. Unable to help himself, he dipped his head for a second time and pressed his lips against hers. Her hands reached up to tangle in his damp hair and he stroked his thumb across the smooth line of her jaw, his fingers tilting up her chin as his tongue traced over her bottom lip. Harley let slip a small moan and leaned into him, hoping that the rest of the world would just fade away into the background like it did in the movies, because being in the arms of Tommy Conlon was by far a better way to spend the rest of her day than what she'd had planned. But then a loud cheer from the gym as a fight was won startled them both to come up for air. Momentarily stunned by what just came over them, they just stood there, staring at each other. Harley licked her lips, enjoying how they tingled, and Tommy's eyes flickered down to watch the darting movement of her tongue, his pupils dilated. He didn't say anything and Harley wondered what it all meant: maybe there was nothing to it, maybe they were just two people who needed a break from their loneliness; maybe she was just a body for him to use, for him to step out of his skin so that he might invade hers. The thought scared her and she instinctively went to step away as if to distance herself, but Tommy wouldn't let her go. \"Stop panickin'. It's okay,\" he reassured her in the voice that he had only ever used with two other people in his whole life, both of whom were dead. It wasn't often that Tommy stepped into the role of the comforter but he felt like he owed it to her somehow. He didn't know her but he felt like he did and he was inexplicably scared that this girl was going to end up with the same scars he bore. When Colt stepped out of his office a few moments later, they were standing far enough away from each other for him not to notice the electricity sparking between them, and he gestured to Harley with a wave of his hand. \"Come on, let's go. I need to get out of this fuckin' office.\" He slapped Tommy on the back as he left, unaware of the way Harley lingered, her fingers curling against his star fighter's bicep of the briefest of moments before she turned to leave as well. It was a small gesture but one that spoke volumes, and Tommy was overwhelmed by the weight of that single touch. From his childhood to the Marines and back again, he had never had the time, stability or inclination to become involved in a relationship with someone. One night stands had been regular occurrences over the years, because the mindless, faceless release of energy into another body was in the same vein as a good fifth of whiskey. He was well versed in sex and fucking and everything else in between, but romance? The few times he had trodden the shallow waters of something similar to a so-called serious relationship, it had been like taking one step forward and three steps back. Women didn't want a man who pushed them away, who had nightmares and flashbacks and mood swings, who fought for money and repentance. The few who had stuck around in his life and bed for more than one drunken night had been lulled into a false sense of romanticism because of his tragic past, thinking that maybe they could be the heroine in their very own chick flick. They offered shoulder rubs and puckered lips and sympathetic nods but they didn't really understand. They didn't understand what it was to be a soldier, a fighter, a carer and a victim all at once; they didn't understand what it felt like to lose their mother, their father, their brother, their best friend. So when they realised that they weren't taking on a fairytale but a horror story, they packed up their shit and left, and Tommy was all the more glad for it. But then Harley had walked through the gym door like the last words of a dying man. She may not understand any of those things either, but she sure as hell seemed to understand a lot more than any of the others. There was knowledge there, hanging heavy in her bones, pain that had been carved into her spine and he knew nothing about this woman but he was terrified she was going to walk the same path he did all those years ago. He knew what it was like to have to drag yourself out of the mouth of hell, and he wanted more than that for her. Why? He didn't know. Maybe that wasn't the way a relationship was supposed to start but he was more than willing to plead ignorance if it meant he got to kiss her again. From the moment she turned away from Tommy, Harley couldn't keep that bloody smile from her face. Even through Colt's dreary rants about fights, even through doing the dishes and curling up on an old pull out sofa, she couldn't stop smiling. She held on to it all night and bounced through the house in the morning, laughing in the way that Colt remembered from when they first met. It was folly really, how she'd managed to let a boy affect her mood so, but she couldn't help it. Tommy was hot and he was nice, and he'd kissed her - twice! Through all the shit that she'd had to put up recently, it was nice to just be happy for once, even if it was short lived. And it was. Just as she climbed into her car to head over to the gym, her phone rang. The words she heard next were enough to wipe that smile right off her smug face. When Tommy fought that afternoon, things weren't much different. His anger still fuelled his fists, his regret, guilt and loss forming a bottomless maelstrom that tore through his muscles and seeped into the flesh or fabric of whatever it was that he was fighting. He was just as animalistic as ever, his infamous carnal ferocity still pulsing through his body like a poison - but it kinda felt like he could breathe easier this time round. His mind was always clear during fights but his chest felt lighter somehow, like it wasn't going to cave in each time his heart beat. His hands were still covered in blood, sand still rubbed in the joints of his bones, but he could breathe. He could breathe. Afterwards, when he stepped out of the shower, water dripping from him, he felt refreshed. He wondered if this is what normal people felt like. It was nice, and the good mood followed him in his walk home. The stars were starting to come out, the evening air still warm. He even allowed himself to look forward to a good night's sleep. When he got home, the lights were still on and the smell of coffee had gone. The door swung on open with a creak, glass dusting the carpet and he stepped across the threshold into the neverending retelling of his childhood. As he closed the door behind him, he struggled to breathe. The scream hung in the pristine corridor like a demon, its claws sharp in the flesh of Harley's back as she banged her fists on the wing door to get someone's attention to let her in. As she was buzzed through, the lead nurse ran over to her with a clipboard, curls of hair sticking to the sweat on her forehead, her scrubs rumpled and her eyes wide. Harley nodded along to whatever she was saying but didn't really hear any of it, too focused on the sound of yelling. \"Help me! I'm being kept here against my will!\" a woman shouted, followed by the sound of crashing. \"She's building up a tolerance,\" she caught the nurse saying before she rounded the corner into the private room. The first thing she saw was her mother thrashing on the bed, trying to buck off the restraints two men were trying to force onto her wrists. Her long dark hair was tangled around her neck, and her gown was caught up between her legs as she kicked at anything that was near. \"Lily, you have to calm down!\" the doctor was saying, hand on her shoulder. A vial with a syringe lay discarded on the table next to him. Harley pushed past the two assistants and latched onto the side of the bed, putting a hand on her mother's forehead. \"Mum! It's me, it's Harley, I'm here. You need to calm down, okay? You're safe, no one is going to hurt you. This is the hospital I brought you to, remember? They're trying to help you, okay?\" Lily twisted her head and stared at her daughter, her struggling coming to a stop. \"Baby girl?\" she asked, voice hoarse, eyes wild. They were a vivid green, as clear as the sea. No matter how far gone she was, her eyes were always lucid. \"Yeah, mum, it's me,\" Harley whispered, forcing a smile to curve her lips. \"I don't want to be here!\" Lily cried out, agitated. \"I need to get out of here! Please don't let them keep me here, baby girl, please!\" Harley sighed, heartbroken. \"I'm sorry, mum, just a bit longer. They can help you, you need to trust them. Just while I figure out the next step, alright?\" It was then that Lily started to cry and she went limp, no longer needing the restraints. \"I hate it here, I hate them, I hate it,\" she sobbed, and Harley nodded at the doctor who waved away the assistants. He hooked up an IV with a sedative and switched over the fluids while Harley comforted her mother; as he left the room, he sent the girl a sympathetic look before leaving them alone. Harley remained there at her mum's side until the medication started to work and Lily succumbed to sleep. When she was sure that no one would hear her, Harley bowed her head and cried. One thousand days sober had meant very little against his son's anger and once the glass had been broken, it was hard to miss the cracks. Paddy Conlon had truly believed that he had found his way, that the light was back in his life and he could relearn how to live again. But then he had felt the bite of coins thrown in his face and suddenly the mirror of sobriety was as shattered as it perhaps had always been. The AA had been his map but Tommy had taken it from him and now he got lost at every single turn. This was something that was nobody's fault but yet everyone was to blame. Tommy had felt the cold touch of regret when he had held his father's drunken body back at the hotel, and he felt it all the more every time he found his father passed out when he came home. It wasn't often and it wasn't for nothing but it was, all the same, just as he expected. Once a drunk, always a drunk. Tommy hated being right and he hated being the reason for it. Whiskey bottles lay discarded and half empty on the living room floor, the television throwing a white static over the darkened room. The kitchen lamp was bright and harsh, lighting the way for Paddy as he crawled across the floor on his hands and knees, chasing after a bottle of liquor that had rolled under the table. Tommy watched his father for a long while. His eyes burned and his hand stung from where he was gripping the doorframe. Then, with painful clarity, he knelt down and pulled his father into his arms. Paddy caught hold of his son and began to sob, his face flushed and his hands shaking as he told Tommy over and over that he was sorry. The words were slurred but the meaning was there. This wasn't the drunk man of his past. Paddy didn't drink because he was angry, he drank because he was sorry, and as Tommy held his drunken father on their kitchen floor, he wasn't sure which one was worse.

It grinds against your bones as you march across the dunes, half blind from the glare of the sun. Vultures circle nearby and you do an automatic sweep to make sure all your men are still at your flank. Their hazy silhouettes, all present and accounted for, comfort you. On your left is Manny. He's your best friend, your brother, the only family you have left. He's running his mouth about something, shooting you a smirk and a wink as he makes some comment that has the others groaning. When he nudges your shoulder with his, you can't help but laugh. It's been a long day - a long tour - but the end is in sight, and it's unsurprising that the conversation turns to what's waiting for you all when you get home. Wives, children, families, friends, you name it, your men have it. What you lookin' forward to, Manny? Me? Man, I can't wait to see my girl again. The wistful tone in his voice makes all the men scoff as they turn to you. What 'bout you, Tommy? Me? Man, I can't wait to see Manny's girl again. The men laugh as Manny takes a playful swipe at your shoulder, not letting the teasing before him. The banter continues around you and you have this feeling like you've all walked off the face of the earth, like you've ascended somehow. You've all seen and done things that the people back home couldn't even dream of, and it's like it's changed your DNA somehow. You've learned to breathe in the sand, to see through the scorching sun, to carry the weight of your gear as if it was nothing. Your unit has been made and unmade together, been broken and reborn together on the battlefield and you know you could conquer the world with these men at your side. The days seem longer under this sun which seems to hang forever in the sky, no matter the time, so you're not sure how long it is before you find the abandoned collection of wood shacks that are half buried beneath the sand. Adjusting the firearm in your grip, you gesture for your men to be on their guard as you approach the tiny village. Most of the structures have collapsed or are about to, though they don't look that old. You feel odd and just as you're about to suggest you move back, Manny calls you over. You find him kneeling inside one of the shacks, holding open a covered ditch in the ground in which you see rudimentary materials that could be used to make explosives. The odd feeling solidifies and you snap out commands for your unit to vacate the area; it's then that the sound of aircraft steals your attention. They're mostly just blotches of shadow against the sun but Smithson is peering through his binoculars and he calls over to you, relief clear in his voice. Friendlies! I can see the flag! When you confirm this with your own pair, you let the tension fade away, grateful to not be thrown into your third firefight in as many days. Manny slaps you on the shoulder and you feel a bit light-headed like you've had too much to drink. You hear laughter as the others whip out their own flags, ready to wave them high and proud in the air. Watching them, you think that you're still too close to the village and you open your mouth to tell them to move back. Before you can get the words out, the first bomb is dropped. Get down! It hits the ground like an earthquake, sending columns of burning sand shooting up into the sky. Manny stumbles beside you from the shockwave and you drag him back to his feet by the lapel of his vest. The men start running, shouting things that you can't hear over the ringing in your ears. You feel Manny push on your shoulder and then the pair of you are being thrown to the side through one of the shacks, and all the sound around you dies with a clap of thunder. You're covered in debris and you're struggling to breathe in. When you look to the side you see one of your boys - Campbell? - and his uniform is crimson, and his mouth is open like he's screaming but you can't hear anything except a shrill keening and when you try to reach out to him, he is swallowed by a hungry mouth of sand. You crawl out from under the rubble, wiping sand from your eyes with the back of your hand, and you slowly drag yourself in the first direction you think of. You try to form words, a name, but your throat is burning and you keep swallowing something metallic each time you cough. Just when you think your legs are going to give out, you see someone lying face down beneath some planks of rotten wood. You don't need to turn them over to know who it is but it still feels like a punch to the gut when you see his face. Manny cries out his wife's name, your name, and his hands are scrabbling at your chest as you try to soothe him, spitting out muffled promises that everything is going to be okay. Your training is racing through your head in sporadic spurts but all you can focus on is the piece of gnarled metal that is protruding from his rib cage and there is so much blood that you can smell it over the burning. You tell him help is coming but when you squint through the smoke all you can see is bodies. Manny stops crying and you hold him tighter just as he goes limp, and you think you're screaming his name but all you can hear is silence as his eyes close and his head falls back. You shake him but he just lies there and your fingers are sticky with his blood, sand in your mouth, and the planes are circling round. You could try to signal them but instead you pray that they have one last bomb to drop because your unit is dead and this is one battlefield you're not planning on leaving alive. It was still dark when he woke. The house was quiet, like the first snowfall in winter, and Tommy walked through the house like it was made of glass. When he poured the alcohol into the sink, he didn't pull the plug. He just let it sit, the smell seeping through the walls like rain, the carpet damp with it. The house creaked and groaned as if the foundations were made of old bones, soil caught in the cracks, whiskey stained marrow. The kitchen floor was scratched from all the broken glass swept under the rug, a faint bloody hand print that had been furiously scrubbed at staining the wall. The man who had made it many years ago was carefully tucked into bed, a pint of water and some aspirin waiting patiently on his bedside table. Unable to remain in that room any longer, Tommy retreated to the stairs and sat down heavy on the bottom step. As he stared out into the darkness before him with burning eyes, he began to shudder. It felt like insects were burrowing around his lungs, biting and consuming as they went; he was a rotting, hollowed thing, his humanity festering in the empty pit of his stomach. Broken; lost. He didn't know what to do and it scared him. His whole life had been one loss after the other, each one bringing him to his knees and now there was no one left. No one except him. He had died a thousand deaths and yet still he remained, begging for an end that was never granted. When he had woken in the hospital after his unit had been killed, he'd asked the nurse if this was the afterlife. She'd laughed and said no. They had all been so clean and sympathetic, treating him like a child with the flu, even when he screamed and threw chairs across the room. When he asked them why his bed was filled with sand, why the water from the tap ran red, why the planes overhead were flying so low, they would just tell him to rest. When he asked them why he was still alive, they had nothing to say. A few days in, some official looking people had sat across from him, using words either too fancy or too dumb for him to understand. He spent the whole meeting staring at his hands. They spoke about apologies and certificates and medals and friendly fire and honourable discharge or leave or whatever it was that he wanted - there was only one thing he wanted - and that he was to get better because they cared about him and because he was a good soldier: it was all bullshit. It was a group of dogs with their tails between their legs because they'd fucked up and he hadn't had the good nature to die with the rest of the sorry cunts in his unit, so the officials actually had to raise their hands and acknowledge their mistake, god forbid. When he healed up, they had sent him on his way with a band-aid and a lollipop, ruffling his hair and ignoring the gore that dripped from his hands. Not knowing where else to go, Tommy had fallen back into the lap of his childhood - and only now was he realising what a huge mistake that was. He had only ever thought about how it would affect him but now he was seeing the impact his presence had on the others around him. Maybe if he had won Sparta it would have been different but in that moment, sat on that step, he couldn't picture tearing his brother apart the way he had wanted to inside the ring. Now, with only a loser's title and an unconscious father in the other room, Tommy could see the mess he had made. His father would still be sober if he hadn't arrived. Brendan would still have won the competition, he was sure of it, and - well, there was no one else in his life, not really. Just a boss, some guys he worked out next to and a pretty girl that he didn't know the age of, and he definitely didn't want to drag her down with him. He wished that he had died. While he was pretty sure that was different from wanting to die, it all boiled down to the same thing. He was here and he didn't want to be. There was no romance or poetry to be found in this wish, just fear. The nurse was wrong: this was the afterlife and his demons knew him well. The devil sang his lullaby and he wanted it to stop. At some point during the night, Tommy wiped away his tears and forced himself to get up from the stairs. His feet dragged and he stumbled against the wall like he was the drunk one, his head spinning as he found himself back at the kitchen sink. The horrific stench of booze had sweated into every pore of the room making him feel sick. He stared into his distorted reflection for a long time before it became too much and he plunged his hand in and wrenched out the plug. The whiskey drained away with a hiss but the smell refused to dissipate. As if on autopilot, Tommy grabbed the bleach from the cleaning cupboard and began pouring it on every surface. He got on his hands and knees like his father and scrubbed the liquid into the dirty tiles. The sweat began trickling down his forehead and he kept seeing drops of blood appearing out of the corner of his eye, making him turn around and clean that bit all over again. Yet even when he had cleaned the entire kitchen, he could still smell the alcohol. Thinking that maybe it was on him, he ripped his shirt off and threw it into the sink, bleaching it and disinfecting it and soaping it down until the material had curdled and gone a sickly white - but the stench was still there, except now it wasn't alcohol but burning flesh he could smell. He didn't stop to think and suddenly the bleach was on his skin and it was burning like sand and the sun and he could hear explosions shaking the floor beneath his feet. Tommy collapsed, panting, hands slipping against the damp floor as he tried to pull himself into the present. He focused on the sting of his skin and it took a few seconds for it click that he had bleach on his arms, and he quickly ran out of the kitchen and into the bathroom where he stripped off his trousers and threw himself into the shower. He turned it to as cold as it went and stood under the water until the burning went away. It was still dark when he got out of the shower - when would it be day again? - and he didn't watch where he was going as he stumbled, shivering and soaking, through into his bedroom. His feet caught on the door frame and he pitched forward onto the nearest bed, face hitting the pillow with perfect accuracy. His eyes closed and he took a deep breath, a new smell filling his senses, one that was familiar but distant, like a forgotten memory. Exhaustion rattled through his bones like a cold wind and he let himself give into it. He turned his head so that he was facing the wall and his body relaxed into the sheets. Just as he felt the heavy drag of sleep pull at the edges of his consciousness, Tommy realised that he must have fallen onto Brendan's bed because he was surrounded by the childhood scent of his big brother and in that last moment before he succumbed to his exhaustion, Tommy felt like he was fourteen years old again. He felt safe. This chapter was rewritten on 30 May 2016. The quote is a poem by Edna St Vincent Millay. AN - you will notice that I have deviated from the canon here by not having Tommy go AWOL but rather be discharged. xo[Chapter 5] REWRITE THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) large moon, the deep orange of embers also the scent, the grief of others beautiful but at a distance - 5 - It took Harley a long time to gather the sufficient courage required to get out of the car and walk into the gym. There was no reason for her to be getting herself worked up like this but she was nervous all the same. It had been over a week since she had seen Tommy which wasn't a big deal at all, but the last time they had seen each other, he'd kissed her. Then she'd kissed him. Then she'd fucked off without a word. Bloody hell. Those kisses seemed like a lifetime ago. Thinking about them was like looking through the window into someone else's life because it had been so perfect that it just didn't sync with everything else that was going on. That tiny moment of happiness had come and gone, and she was left with an unquenched desire to have more but it just didn't seem possible. Things like that didn't happen for her. So much so that she had genuinely considered never returning to the gym. Harley was prone to moments of spectacular cowardice and for a good few days, she'd convinced herself that it would be better for everyone involved if they went their separate ways. Tommy obviously had a lot going on and she sure as hell did, so perhaps it was easier for the both of them to focus on their own lives before delving into someone else's. After all, they'd only kissed. Nothing else, nothing more. Nothing to get her hopes up over. They'd only known each other for three weeks, for goodness sake! That wasn't a relationship. That was little more than bumping into a stranger. With their mouths. Twice. But whatever. It wasn't like she'd be throwing anything away! It made sense, it really did. At least, that was what she told herself over and over again until it sunk in, but no matter how hard she tried to talk herself out of it, there she was, sat outside the gym. There was just something about Tommy that made her shiver at the mere thought of him. She'd so neatly slotted into the space next to him and now she didn't want to leave, regardless of how little they knew each other. And so. It was early but she knew Tommy's schedule well enough by now that she was certain he'd be there, working out. Setting her shoulders, she got herself out of the car and entered the foyer, eyeing Tommy's jacket hanging on the back of the front desk chair. Already she could hear the quiet murmur of the patrons and she peeked round the corner as subtly as she could to count a handful of guys milling around the large room, doing their own thing. She spotted Tommy easily, attacking the punching bag as if it had done something to personally offend him. A few of the others glanced at him, picking up on the same anger she was feeling all the way from across the room. Hmm. Perhaps not the best time to make her grand reappearance after all. Deciding to cut her losses and head back to Colt's place, Harley turned on her heel when the call of her name stopped her short. Straight away she knew who the voice belonged to and she rolled her eyes, cursing that he was the one of all people to notice her. As she slowly pivoted round, she saw Mad Dog leaning over the ropes in the ring, a wide smirk greasing his face. She felt rather than saw some of the others look over at her and she prayed that Tommy wasn't one of them. \"Mmm?\" Nonchalant, that was the way to play it. If she showed even a hint of misplaced enthusiasm, poor ol' Grimes would just get spurred on and she did not have the energy for that oversized puppy to be dancing at her heels. He beckoned her over but she remained by the doorway, feet glued to the floor. \"Aw, come on doll, I just wanted to see how you're doin'.\" His gaze climbed up and down her frame and she wondered why the hell he was pretending to be interested when she was only ever dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. She hadn't bothered with much makeup that morning and her hair was thrown into a messy bun at the back of her head - nothing that merited a call back. \"I'm doing fine, thanks,\" she said back, hoping he would let it drop. Instead he raised an eyebrow. \"Really, doll? You don't look like you're doing too hot.\" There wasn't anything malicious in his tone but being called out in front of a room of men like that was pretty embarrassing, and she fought back a blush. \"Good thing I don't care about your opinion,\" she retorted, refusing to look over to where Tommy stood. \"Oh baby, you shouldn't lie to yourself,\" he drawled with a wink and Harley rolled her eyes. \"Get over yourself, Mad Dog, I'm not fucking interested,\" she snapped back, thoroughly irritated. The man's sense of humour finally broke and he stood up straight, scowling. \"Right back at you, bitch. I don't know who the fuck you think you are but you have some nerve comin' in here and actin' like you're the queen of the damn place!\" Harley rolled her eyes, cursing her decision to go to the gym in the first place. \"Okay then, bye,\" she said as she turned away, not interested in dragging out such a stupid fight. \"There she goes, thinkin' she's better than the rest of us!\" he called after her, voice carrying. \"Stuck up slut.\" The ridiculous insult didn't even faze her and she had no intention of turning back when she heard his voice, low but firm. \"Don't talk to her like that.\" She wheeled around and darted back into the hall to see Tommy stood by the ring, watching Mad Dog with a cold, calculating look. Anger seemed to radiate from him, crackling like a wood fire, but there was a preternatural stillness to him that you only ever saw in those trained to be unseen. \"How 'bout you mind your damn business, Riordan,\" Mad Dog spat, clearly affronted to his professional nemesis stepping on his toes yet again. He climbed out of the ring and came to stand directly before Tommy, purposefully getting in his face. The others had stopped what they were doing now, inching closer though not making any further move to get involved - Harley didn't blame them, for coming between Tommy and Grimes would be like coming between a freight train and an angrier freight train. Clearly these two were not friends and jumped on any chance they could to knock each other around, but Harley could easily see that there was something else going on with Tommy. It wouldn't take much to trigger that hot anger building up inside him. When Tommy continued to stare at Mad Dog in that unsettling way he did, the older man did the only thing that came more naturally to him than fighting - run his mouth. \"What does it have to do with you, anyway?\" he sneered. \"What, you fuckin' her now? Jeez, that didn't take long did it -\" Harley didn't even see Tommy move but when she blinked Mad Dog was on the floor, clutching his nose while the ex-Marine stood over him, breathing hard. Two of the bystanders came forward to help Grimes sit up, one of them grabbing ice for his face. When another told Tommy to walk away and he just stared at him in that same way, Harley lurched forward to wrap her hands around his arm. After a few insistent tugs he seemed to notice her presence and let her steer him into the foyer. She pushed him down into the desk chair and grabbed his fist to inspect his knuckles, stroking her thumb across them to feel for a break. Tommy watched what she was doing intently, trying to suppress the shiver that raced up his spine at her touch. \"What the hell was that?\" she asked him without looking up, focused on her task. \"He insulted you,\" Tommy said slowly as if it should be obvious. Harley snorted, not at all impressed. \"Bullshit. There's something going on with you, more than some stupid grudge with that guy.\" Tommy shrugged but didn't reply and Harley sighed, letting his hand drop, satisfied it was okay. \"How'd you know to do that?\" he asked her as she looked down at his blood splattered hand with a strange expression. \"Did it for my dad all the time.\" Tommy frowned and looked up but at Harley's expression, he didn't push it. \"Why'd you come back?\" he asked instead, watching her watch him. \"Why'd you punch Mad Dog?\" she retorted and he couldn't help but smile a little at her tone, at the bittersweetness of the moment. \"I'm going to figure you out, Tommy Conlon,\" she assured him, smiling with challenge in her eyes. Tommy shook his head, smiling wider now, letting her earth-cool presence draw the heat out from his bones. He could hear muttering of the guys inside and realised he really didn't have the inclination of dealing with the aftermath of his little smackdown, so he made a snap decision and stood up, grabbing a hold of Harley's hand as he did so. \"Come on, let's get outta here.\" Harley brightened at the prospect and followed close behind him, letting him lead her to the sidewalk. The morning sun was still shining, the birds singing from the trees in a cheerful tune that put her into higher spirits, enjoying their casual closeness. \"You hungry?\" he asked her and she scoffed. \"Honey, the first thing you need to learn about me is that I'm always hungry.\" Tommy laughed and gestured to the west, saying there was a good breakfast place a short walk away, and she grinned, pleased that he wanted to spend time with her. For a little while they said nothing because there was too much for them to say. So many questions were building up behind their teeth but they didn't want to have to answer any themselves, so they held them back. They walked in time with each other, their arms brushing, finding that easy cadence to being together that gave them both a small thrill. They kept expecting the whole thing to be difficult, to be painful, but so far it was shaping up to be the least painful thing either of them was having to deal with; an unexpected respite that was as needed as it was wanted. The air was getting cooler as clouds started to roll and when Harley shivered, Tommy quickly pulled off his jacket to drape it over her shoulders. She smiled at him so warmly that he didn't think he would need a jacket for the rest of the day. They arrived at a small but cute cafe that boasted the best pancakes and they were not wrong. Their conversation was mild but enough to not be awkward, and Tommy laughed as she drowned her breakfast in maple syrup, and Harley teased him as he took an age to find the healthiest thing on the menu. There were still rules to the allowable topics of conversation but they were learning how to navigate them now, settling for details about themselves that didn't hurt. Harley told Tommy how much she loved his laugh, giggling when he blushed, and he admired the leonine wildness of her hair that turned auburn in the sun. It wasn't until the walk back that Tommy touched her gently on the small of back for half a second, causing Harley to look up at him. \"I didn't think you were gonna come back,\" he admitted quietly. \"I was always going to come back. You don't walk away from a kiss like that.\" Tommy grinned a little, tucking his hands into his pockets. \"You liked it?\" he asked, trying so hard not to sound shy. Harley smiled to herself and decided this was a moment she wasn't going to be a coward. \"Tommy. It's all I can think about,\" she said seriously. \"Same,\" he murmured, not feeling guilty that he was lying because he had thought about it, just alongside sand and demons and death - but he'd save that gem for another day. \"Really?\" she asked and he was astounded to hear the uncertainty in her voice, the lack of self belief. It seemed so unlike her that he stopped dead in the street, pulling her round to face him. \"Really.\" Without sparing a thought to who would see, Tommy pulled her mouth to his, the softness of her lips already committed to memory. He cupped her face with one hand, wrapping the other around her waist, enjoying how he was pressing against him, trusting and eager. When she wrapped her hands around his neck, holding on tight, he thought how perfectly they fit. He heard someone tut as they walked by but he didn't care and just kissed her harder, allowing himself this one indulgence. \"I think we're going to get done for public indecency in a minute,\" Harley whispered in his ear when they pulled away. Tommy smirked and let her step away though he kept his hand around her waist, not ready to let her go just yet. They walked back to the gym like that, comfortable in their silence. Harley said goodbye to him at the door and he caught her glancing over her shoulder at him as she climbed into her car. Even after she had gone, Tommy rested against the doorway for a long while. He could hear Mad Dog bitching even from outside but he refused to let him or anyone else disturb his dormant anger; he knew it was only a matter of time before his control cracked and he wanted to take advantage of this calm before the storm that Harley had granted him for as long as he could. Harley drove away wondering how long it would be until she next saw Tommy, but it turned out that she didn't have to wait very long at all. It was only when she got to the hospital to see her mum that she realised she still had Tommy's jacket on. She texted Colt for Tommy's address and when she left the hospital, she drove over to his house. It was a small house, sandwiched between a line of others like a row of boxes at the back of an abandoned warehouse. There was only one car in the driveway and the whole street was quiet, unnervingly so. Back home there had never been a quiet street, no matter what time of the day or night it was. A pale dancing light from the window implied that someone was watching the television so Harley steeled herself and knocked on the front door. No one answered for a long time and Harley wondered whether she was at the wrong house or if it was too late for people to be knocking on doors, but then the lock was pulled back and a man with white hair and a face like weathered stone appeared. His expression was expectant but guarded, and he smelt very strongly of coffee. \"Can I help you, miss?\" \"Hi, um, is this Tommy's house?\" The man swallowed, paused then nodded. \"Is he in?\" \"Who's asking?\" His question was quite blunt, almost rudely so, but Harley supposed that it was a reasonable one to ask and she sent him a bright smile in an attempt to get him to relax. He seemed really uptight and nervous and she guessed that he was Tommy's father. Maybe they'd had an argument or something. \"I'm Harley Sinclair, I know Tommy from the gym? He left his coat behind so I just wanted to drop it off.\" The man looked down at the jacket in her hand and he quickly reached forward to pick it up. Harley let him take it, a tad put out at his standoffish attitude. She sighed and took a step back down the stone stairs and put her hands out in a submissive gesture. \"Sorry if I disturbed you. If it's not too much to ask, could you just let him know that I dropped by?\" The man watched her for a minute or two and Harley shuffled her feet under his gaze, but then he sagged a little and glanced over his shoulder. \"No, I'm sorry, miss,\" he sighed. \"It's just that every so often some girl will turn up outside this house begging to see my son. Fans, y'know? Some of them are quite pushy and Tommy's sleepin'... he needs his sleep, I don't wanna disturb him.\" Harley smiled and stepped back up, emitting the calm that she used when dealing with her mother. \"No worries. It was lovely to meet you…\" \"Paddy, Paddy Conlon.\" They shook hands and when she leant forward, the light from the hallway splashed across her voice and Paddy's eyes widened in recognition. \"I know you!\" \"Er, do you?\" \"Yeah, I do! I've seen your face before, a beautiful face. Though the hair was more red… what did you say your name was? Sinclair? Are you a relation, by any chance, to Lily Sinclair?\" Harley dropped Paddy's hand like he had burned her and Paddy lost his smile at her cold expression. \"How do you know my mother?\" \"Oh, er, sometimes the AA visits the hospital, y'know, to keep the patients company. Lily is a kind woman - I read her some Moby Dick the other week. She said she liked it very much.\" \"The AA?\" Her tone was flat and sharp like a sheet of black ice. Paddy flinched and wrung his hands. \"So they're letting random drunks into my mother's room?\" Paddy cringed at how she worded her accusation and hurried to correct her. \"No! There's a hall we sit in with any patients that want to join, and there's doctors and nurses there, we're never alone with them… and we're not drunks, we're recovering alcoholics!\" Harley let out a disbelieving bark of laughter that sounded like the noise a condemned man might make, and whirled away, head spinning. \"Miss, I'm sorry! We had permission from the hospital, we thought everyone knew.\" Harley ignored him. A small part of her suspected that she was being irrationally emotional but with everything that she was dealing with, the weight of caring for her mother - who always seemed to be screaming or crying whenever she turned up but was apparently well enough to hang out with the fucking AA - was getting the best of her. \"She's in there because of people like you,\" she heard herself spit, covering her face with her hands. Paddy couldn't believe that he had somehow managed to make this girl cry within the space of a few minutes, when all she had wanted to do was drop off his son's coat. He swallowed thickly, anxious. Tommy was going to be angry with him, more so than he already was. If this woman really was friends with his son, then he wasn't going to take kindly to his father having made her cry in the middle of the street. He didn't know what to do. Part of him wanted to just shut the door and pretend like it never happened, because that was how he dealt with most things – but then he heard movement behind him and the next thing he knew, Tommy was pushing past him and running out after the girl. \"Harley!\" he called out, his hair ruffled from sleep and his chest bare. \"Wait, Harley! Hey, what's goin' on? Why you here? Why you cryin'?\" He grabbed her elbow and pulled her round to face him, and something funny in his chest lurched at the sight of tears running down her face. She hastily wiped them away but they were just replaced by new ones and it looked like she coming apart at the seams, collapsing into herself. \"I came to give you your stupid coat back,\" she snapped, gesturing wildly to where Paddy still stood in the doorway. Tommy glared at him and waved him away. \"Did he say somethin' to upset you?\" Tommy asked and Harley clawed at her cheeks as if trying to rip her own skin off rather than just her tears. \"No. Yes! It's just - my mum has been spending time with his goddamn AA group, listening to Moby fucking Dick like everything's fine and here I am, running around like an idiot trying to figure out what the hell I'm going to do with a shit ton of hospital bills I can't afford to pay, nowhere to live, a ninety day visa that's quickly running out and no one to help me except my fucking father who is the reason we're in this mess in the first place! She screams every time I see her and yet alcoholics get to sit and read with her? Why? How is that fair?\" She was crumbling now, the words pouring from her like ash as she sobbed in a way that people could only do if a part of them had died. Normally so confident, she was now so small in Tommy's arms. Not knowing what else to do, he reacted purely on instinct and pulled Harley against his chest and held her as tight as he could without hurting her. Her hands curled around him like she was afraid she would drown without him, and he rested his chin against her temple, feeling the way she shook in his arms, fragile and trembling as if she was held together by a single thread that was beginning to splinter. He held her the way he'd held his mother when she cried and he stroked her hair the same, and he didn't let go until she had cried herself out. It was the second time that day that Tommy had held Harley in the middle of the street without a care in the world for what anyone else thought, but the circumstances were so vastly different, he could barely comprehend it. When Harley pulled away, she was quiet, too drained to feel as embarrassed as she normally would have at her breakdown though she did avoid his gaze. Sighing, Tommy put his fingers underneath her chin and guided her head up so that she had to look at him, and then he stroked his thumb over her bottom lip. The intimacy of the gesture made Harley blush but instead of pulling away, she gave him a shaky smile, hoping to convey her gratitude through that one look. \"How do you do that?\" she whispered. \"Do what?\" \"That.\" Tommy shrugged, unsure at first of what she meant but when she reached up and kissed him hard, he thought he had an idea. \"I should apologise to your dad,\" she murmured but Tommy shook his head. \"Leave it. You did nothin' wrong.\" Harley sighed and slipped back against his chest, and they wrapped their arms around each other, allowing themselves that one moment of shared vulnerability. Something had changed between them as if a small seed had taken root within them. There was an energy in the air, one that crackled with an untold stress and pain they were loathe to confess to, but Tommy had seen her begin to break before his eyes and his first reaction had been to put her back together – and he would do it again and again if he had to. It didn't take him long to realise that, in that moment, his desire to fix Harley eclipsed his desire to die, and hell, if that wasn't a sign then he didn't know what was. This chapter was rewritten on 30 May 2016. The quote is a poem called Sonoma Fire by Jane Hirshfield. xo[Chapter 6] REWRITE THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) the mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive but finding something to live for - 6 - It was exhausting trying to ascertain whether he cared too much or not enough. Tommy had never conquered the art of finding a middle ground, raised instead to swing violently from one extreme to the other, never settling, never really knowing how he felt. He'd just seen Harley break down before him, but that wasn't what shook him. Tommy had spent his life standing witness to the collapse of a congregation, men and women falling under the hardship of grief. His waking hours were saturated with the grief of those he had once known, his hands soaked with their tears. He'd felt the tremor of earth and man alike torn asunder; they all bled the same. If there was one thing that Tommy knew, it was blood. He knew the way it dripped like hot wax, the heat of it against his fingertips, the penny tang of it on his tongue. He knew that whether it was spreading through bed linen, combat green or desert sand, it was all the same. No, it wasn't her breakdown that had him frozen in the middle of the road. When Harley had scrawled her phone number across his forearm before leaving that night, Tommy had scrambled for some semblance of clarity of what this meant to him. He stood far too long in the falling night, arm upturned as if her pen was still scratching across his skin, staring at the blue ink of the odd string of numbers. Despite it all, he still yearned for connection. He ached for someone to be there. Sometimes he wanted it so bad that it would choke him in his sleep and he would wake, gasping and shaking from the cold truth that he was alone and would always be alone. How could he ask someone to walk behind him when he left nothing but ruin in his wake? To be with him was to skirt the edges of death and not even man trained to kill could condemn someone so absolutely. But Harley - fuck . She was just a young girl, barely in her twenties, and already she had one hand behind the curtain, fingernails turning black. So quickly she had let her cracks show, too easily she had let him put her back together… she was so young, so innocent - too innocent for him to stain her with his bloodied hands but she had tied red string around his wrists, binding them together. How long, he wondered, before it became a noose and her china doll neck would shatter from the weight of his demons? He would remain; there was no doubt about that. He had a habit of being the last one standing, cursed with the immortality of survival. Yes, he would live on through whatever tragedy Harley would suffer, continuing on without substances, just his old boxing gloves and a knot of red string in his pocket. And yet he couldn't turn away. There was something about that woman that got under his skin, messing with his reason. She was a speck of sunlight through thick smoke and he had been breathing in the fumes for too long. Where he bore gaping wounds, she had only shallow fractures and he'd be on the field long enough to know that you could fix that, easy. Was that what he wanted to do? Fix her? He didn't know. Maybe there was still that part of him that was desperate to believe that there was more to life that grave dirt. Perhaps there was one person that could sidestep the noose, loosen the anchor, and with her soft lips and bright eyes, he wanted that person to be her. When he washed the ink off his arm in the shower, pink raised lines were left behind. They'd faded the next day but he could still picture the numbers as if she had tattooed them there, so no matter how long he procrastinated, he had no excuse but to pluck up the courage and call her. \"Hello?\" She sounded distracted and Tommy could hear cars and wind in the background as if she was walking. He swallowed, ran a hand through his hair and decided to just put himself out there, just for once. \"Hey, Harley, it's, uh, it's Tommy.\" There was a small pause on the other end and a million scenarios, most of them bad, ran through Tommy's mind in the space it took Harley to respond. \" Oh, hi! \" she chirped, sounding happier. \" I'm really glad you called! For a while there, I didn't think you would, \" she said with a small laugh. \"Of course I was gonna call.\" Was he? \" Well… good. I'm glad I haven't scared you off yet. \" She laughed again, sounding a bit awkward, and he knew she was recalling last night. He relaxed a little when he realised that she felt as out of her depth as he did. \"You've still got time,\" he teased, shamelessly wanting to hear her laugh again, pleased when she did. \" What, is it a 'three meltdowns and you're out' kinda deal? \" \"Eh, I'll give you four, 'cause you're cute.\" He had no idea where that came from but fuck it, he'd said it, he was going with it. \" You're not bad yourself, \" she retorted, a tad shy. When he hesitated, she continued. \" So, did you call me for a reason or did you just want to shower me with compliments for the fun of it? \" There she was, that mischief back in place now that they had found their equilibrium. The only thing was, he didn't really have a concrete reason to call her: 'to hear the sound of your voice' was something you kept to the seventh or eighth date, not ten minutes into whatever the hell their 'thing' was called. He hesitated, frantically trying to come up with a pragmatic answer. As the silence grew longer, he got more nervous, until he landed on the last idea to run through his head. \"Well, um, I'm lookin' for places, y'know, to live, an' was wonderin' if ya wanted to tag along?\" Harley stifled a laugh. She could practically taste his awkwardness, the way he struggled to act like he was completely comfortable in their impromptu little tête-à-tête, and it relaxed her somehow. He was a breath of fresh air in a world of smog, a pause in the constant rush of her life. Knowing that this was all new to him was comforting, reassured her that he was a good guy. She didn't know who he was or where he'd been, but she wanted to find out. There were secrets stuffed into his stitching, but if he'd let her, she had the patience to unpick every one. \" Yeah, sure! \" She didn't dare hide her enthusiasm, guessing correctly that Tommy needed every bit of encouragement she could give him that this was okay. He cleared his throat and Harley imagined that he was smiling. \"Okay, um, good. I've got a viewin' on Thursday if you're, er, if you're free?\" Tommy cursed his sudden inability to spit out a fucking sentence. \" Yeah, definitely! Just send me the address and time, and I can meet you at yours? \" Tommy agreed a bit too quickly, his fingers tapping a nervous tune on his thigh as they said their goodbyes. When Harley hung up, he stared at the phone in his hand for too long before placing it delicately on the bedside table. It felt as if he was hanging from a precipice, gazing into something he couldn't colour. Talking to her felt like slowing after a sprint, breathing hard, heart racing but endorphins running. Maybe he was just latching on to the first person outside his fucked up family to show him attention, maybe he was just so desperate to escape the death lurking on his shadow that he would drown himself in the first thing to feel like life - maybe this was all a big fucking mistake, but he couldn't help but think, what if? What if it was time to move past the graveyard he'd been living in, to let himself believe in the possibility of there being something more than this life he'd condemned himself to, these four walls and the smell of burning. He was the last one left and, God help him, maybe that meant something. Tommy had never believed in second chances but he knew that if there was one out there for him, it was in Harley. A hand on her shoulder startled Harley from her dream. It dispersed quickly as she sat up, groggily blinking at the face before her that she took a while to place. \"Sorry to disturb you,\" the man said and she shook her head, yawning as she swept her hair back into a ponytail. As her head cleared, she realised this was her mother's consultant and she immediately sat up straight. \"Doctor Warren! I'm sorry, I was expecting you until tomorrow.\" The man smiled, crows feet crinkling around the corner of his eyes. \"I thought since I was here, I'd see how everything was going. I've been looking at her chart, but wanted to hear from you.\" Harley shrugged, turning to look down at her slumbering mother, studying the way her hair coiled across the standard issue pillow, fingers twitching as she dreamed. Lily seemed younger in sleep, peaceful. \"The same, really. Apparently she's been building up a tolerance to the meds, so her hallucinations have been coming back, and her paranoia. She keeps going on about mics and cameras - I had to check all the cupboards and the wardrobe this morning, just so she would let the nurse change over her IV.\" \"I expected as much. In order to keep her stable, she requires a mix of anti-depressants, anti-psychotics and mood stabilisers, all of which she is reacting less and less to. If we keep upping the dosage, she's going to start losing parts of herself. That's something you're going to need to start asking yourself, Harley. Where do you think the balance lies?\" Harley sighed, dragging her fingers through her hair as she let the doctor's words sink in. It wasn't the first time she'd spoken to him about how far she should go with keeping her mother medicated. Her mind was so splintered that she needed so much to keep her calm, and her personality would start to drift away like wisps of summer cloud. Did she keep her sedated and watch her mother turn into a vegetable, or did she pull away from meds and watch her soar and drop like a rollercoaster, believing she could become the next President one day then trying to hang herself the next. \"Look, Harley. I'm going to tell you this because I know you can handle it, and you need to start coming to terms with it: Lily is not going to get better. She has suffered horribly and no matter the treatments she's undergone, either here or back home, she is not responding to them and us keeping her full of drugs all day isn't going to help that. Your mother is very ill, both mentally and physically, and she is always going to be that way - there isn't much we can do for her anymore except make her comfortable - something that is going to cost you a lot of money. Money I don't expect you have.\" He took a deep breath as Harley leant on the bed railing, head in her hands. It was hard, but he knew he had to carry on. \"Really, there are only two options here: either you need to completely hand her over to the pysch institute, or you need to take her home.\" \"But I don't have anywhere to take her to,\" Harley whispered, and she was appalled at the way her throat closed up, making her voice break, \"and I can't put her in an asylum, I just can't.\" The doctor sighed and squeezed the girl's shoulder. \"It's a psychiatric institute, not an asylum, and they're good, supportive places,\" he gently chided, wishing, as he always did, he could do more to help. \"If you're planning on staying in Pittsburgh, you're going to need to decide what you're doing - and I recommend that you do stay. Your mom isn't fit for travel, especially not international. We can keep her here as long as you need, but I strongly suggest you decide on your next option.\" Harley nodded, miserable, and the doctor nodded to himself before leaving her alone, closing the door behind him as quietly as he could. \"What would you do, if it was me?\" Harley wondered, brushing her fingers through Lily's mahogany hair. Shaking her head, she stood up and turned away from the bed. The clock on the wall said that it was getting near the time that Tommy said her to meet him, and she didn't want him to see her get upset again. It had been horrific enough the first time. With not that long to go, she ducked into the small en suite bathroom that was off her mother's room and quickly freshened up her makeup, dragging a brush through her wild hair in a futile attempt to tame it. She was dressed in some jeans and a t-shirt, not the flashiest of outfits but she was too drained to put much thought into it. Harley kissed her mum's forehead, and threw a hurried goodbye over her shoulder to the nurses as she rushed out to her car. It didn't take her long to drive round to Tommy's, and she suspected he'd been waiting for her seeing how he opened the door half a second after she'd knocked. She said hello and Tommy just smiled a little, making a weird kind of shiver tumble down her spine, like she was nervous and excited all at once. They didn't really say much as they made the way to his car and as soon as they clambered inside, Tommy switched on the radio to save them from any awkward silence. Some small talk was attempted but when it was obvious that they were both lying through their teeth, they stopped. Luckily it didn't take long to arrive at the small flat on the outskirts of town. It looked pretty nice from the outside and better on the inside: plainly decorated with decent sized rooms and only a few things that needed fixing. The landlord seemed pleasant enough, happily showing them around as he explained that he had used to live there with his wife but now that she was pregnant, they had moved somewhere bigger and were looking to bring in a bit of income. Still, Tommy didn't seem to be overly impressed though Harley liked the character the place seemed to hold. \"It's further out than I wanted,\" Tommy grumbled as he looked out the living room window. Harley leant on the wall next to him, watching the way he clenched and unclenched his jaw saw he thought. \"Don't get it then,\" she said with a shrug. Tommy sighed, glancing at her. \"I gotta move out,\" he said more to himself than her, expression sombre. She thought of his dad, the way they had moved around each other, trying to keep that perfect distance. \"Not happy at home?\" Harley asked, intrigued. Tommy scoffed and stood up straight, looking down at her with a frown. \"Nah. It's too crowded in there, him an' me…\" and the ghosts that hid around each corner. \"Tell me about it,\" Harley agreed, offering a little bit of empathy in the only way she could, \"living out of a hospital room and on someone else's couch makes you crave just one place to call your own.\" She laughed a little, shooting him a warm smile when he seemed to appreciate rather than reject her attempt to connect. \"I feel that,\" he murmured, taking another look around. The place wasn't too bad, nicely sized and well furnished. He had a car, so really the dsitance thing wasn't an issue, it would just cost more for gas but it wasn't like he was completely strapped for cash. Brendan had given him some at the end of the fight and though most of that had gone to Pilar, he'd kept a small amount for a situation just like this. When he'd come back to the 'Burgh, he hadn't expected to move into his Pop's house, just wanted to utilise his special set of 'skills' before the match. Now that it was all over and done with, he was desperate for his own place in the city. \"Hmm. I'll think 'bout it,\" he said and Harley nodded, moving towards the door. When he didn't follow straight away, she held out her hand for him to take and his hesitation was barely noticeable as he took it. She smiled bright and guided him out while he just focused on the sensation of her hand in his, smooth fingers against his rough callouses, warm and firm. When she pulled away to get into the car, he held back a small pout, aware of how stupid he was being. Still, he couldn't deny how much he enjoyed the closeness so as he got the car back onto the road, he quickly made up his mind and moved his hand from the steering wheel to her thigh, just above the knee. Harley stopped mid sentence - he couldn't even recall what she'd been saying - and looked down at his hand before turning her gaze to him, clearly taken aback. Fearing that he was being too forward, he went to remove his hand but Harley placed hers over his before he could. She opened her mouth to say something then changed her mind and instead leaned her head against the window, opting for an air of nonchalance. Tommy glanced at her out of the corner of his eye and smiled, appreciating her insight. During the drive, Tommy found himself thinking once more about what if. The naturalness of their touch, the ease of which they navigated their quiet rules, the gentle fire that was beginning to smolder between them - it wasn't enough. He wanted more. Just this small taste of her and he was already addicted, bordering on fearful of being left bereft if she came to her senses, if she looked too close at his fine print. Thing was, she was so deserving, made for the likes of a hero to sweep her off her feet and offer the world, radiant and peaceful. He was surprised she wasn't already tied up in such a reality, someone praying at the altar of her feet - and he started to think about what relationships she had already experienced. Had she been someone's girlfriend before? Did she want to be his? Girlfriend. The word was foreign to him. He had never been worthy of such a thing, knew he wasn't worthy of it now. His brother had been a boyfriend, Manny had been one, lots of the guys in his units had been, but not him. To have someone that was completely yours, someone to see the good and the bad, he couldn't imagine a world in which someone would want to take that on, not for him. But then, here was Harley, sat hand in hand. Maybe he was jumping the gun a bit, maybe she didn't feel that way about him in the slightest, but… maybe she did. She'd kissed him, more than once, and here she was now. Here she was. Tommy glanced over at her again. Maybe girlfriend was a bit strong, but he wanted to be in his life, to be his. It was a strange feeling, to want someone alive so much. He was used to wanting the dead, but not Harley. She was light and life and laughter, the lullaby his mother had sung to him when he was scared. But… a relationship? He didn't know how to do that shit, the only thing he did know was that he would let her down. Again and again until she finally got sick of him and would leave, fulfilling the prophecy that haunted him. Manny had said that things like sharing and honesty were key to a healthy relationship, but how the fuck could he expose this woman to his truth? He was jumping ahead again. They had spent barely any time with each other and he was already panicking about being in a relationship. Harley might not even want to be in a relationship with him. Maybe she was just being nice. Maybe she was seeing someone else. Unable to help himself, Tommy frowned at the thought. He knew that he had no right to know, to be bothered if she was seeing someone but he couldn't stop himself from picturing her sharing some stranger's bed, taking off her clothes - \"Tommy? Are you okay?\" Harley's voice startled him out of his masochistic thoughts and brought him back to reality. His fingers tightened on her thigh before he forced them to relax, taking a deep breath through his nose. \"Yeah, I'm fine,\" he replied quietly, jaw tight. Harley frowned, not believing him. \"Are you sure?\" Tommy sighed, not replying until he pulled up in front of his father's apartment. He turned off the engine and sat in silence for a moment. \"I'm just thinkin' 'bout… 'bout us.\" The words may have been forced out through gritted teeth but he was smart enough to realise he was going down a dangerous path. It wouldn't be fair on himself or her to keep her in the dark. \"Okay,\" Harley replied, drawing out the word. \"That sounds awfully serious. What type of 'us' were you thinking about?\" She realised belatedly that she had on her 'sensible voice' but she was feeling a little bit out of her depth; she couldn't discern the expression on Tommy's face and it had her on edge. \"I was thinkin' 'bout where we're goin', y'know?\" He cleared his throat, ridiculously nervous, not able to catch her eye just yet. \"An' how serious this is. Is this goin' somewhere or are we just messin' around?\" \"Well, I don't think we're messing around,\" Harley said slowly. \"I don't think we're really doing anything yet… I didn't even realise there was an 'us'.\" Tommy deflated a little and she rushed to explain. \"Not that I don't want there to be an 'us', I do… I just think that we should sit and talk about this properly. Just… not in a car.\" Her words not quite reassuring him but still determined to see this through, Tommy gestured over his shoulder. \"Wanna come in? Pop's out.\" Harley smiled and nodded, biting her lower lip as she turned to get out. Tommy watched her go before joining her, hyperaware of her presence at his side as they walked to the front door in silence. There was nowhere left for them to run. It was time for them to show their hand and they were terrified. Yet, they couldn't stop themselves from hoping that maybe, just maybe, there was something beautiful in the making. This chapter was rewritten on 3 July 2016. This chapter's quote is by Dostoyevsky. xo[Chapter 7] REWRITE THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) forever alone until i found you and now you're always there voice in the air, scent on my clothes - but when the sun exposes all my demons will you stay or run away? - 7 - His house smelled like stale coffee and bleach. When the lights blinked on, they were harsh, too white, cutting through the shadows that crawled beneath the aged furniture. Dust coated every surface, hung unmoving in the air like a haze, obscuring the flat faces of empty photo frames that were lined up like obituaries on the side table. Everything was still as if the house was waiting, waiting. When Harley stepped onto the threadbare carpet, Tommy stared at her like she was an intruder. Uncomfortable, she turned to survey the hallway, her gaze snagging on the patchwork wall by the staircase, squares and rectangles of paisley wallpaper paler than the rest: ghosts of where photos used to be, faces that were no longer welcome. There was a coat stand by the corner that had one hook broken off, and the understairs cupboard looked to have been kicked in a long time ago. \"It's nice,\" she found herself saying, the compliment bleak at best. Tommy didn't even bother to humour it as he watched her appraise his home, learned eyes spotting her discomfort like she was a target and he was lining up his shot. Then, as if suddenly remembering who she was, he took her jacket and hung it over the bannister. \"Want a drink?\" he asked her, sounding solemn. Harley sucked in a breath, the sound rattling around the hallway like a copper penny in a beggar's tin, and clenched her fists tight. The amicable air between them was curdling in the cold, Tommy visibly withdrawing from her and she knew she had to grab onto him lest he bow out before they even sat down. \"Sure! Coffee, if you have any?\" He nodded and disappeared into the kitchen without indicating where she should go. Feeling silly lingering by the front door, she wandered into the living room that looked out onto the dark, empty street, and perched on the corner of the lone couch. The leather squeaked as she pulled her legs up underneath her, folding in on herself in that way she did so well. Tommy entered in silence, the steam of her drink wisping around his jawline like smoke, and Harley thought that he looked too big for the room, too much for the four walls. He handed her the coffee and sat down next to her, keeping his feet firmly on the ground. Perhaps she should have thanked him for inviting her in, but it sounded false even in her head so she kept her mouth shut, deciding instead to watch him. Or, rather, observe him. It was clear to see that he was not in his natural habitat. It might have been his house but it was not his home, moving as he did through the space like he was a guest, afraid to settle, afraid to leave a mark. She wondered what stories were hidden here, in the depths of the brick and mortar. \"Is this your childhood home?\" Harley was intrigued when Tommy's gaze snapped to her with a trained precision, that deep expanse of grey blue threatening to swallow her whole. \"Yes.\" There was a warning in his tone, though it was more habitual than anything, Harley decided, and she was struck at how a whole lifetime lay buried within that single word, spoken with such acrid articulation it made her toes curl. \"It is just you and your dad that live here?\" She thought of the man that answered the door to her, face like a history book, voice like gravel, and she watched as Tommy's lips pursed for the briefest of seconds. \"Yes.\" \"Have you always lived here? When you weren't with the Marines, I mean.\" \"No.\" Jesus, Harley thought. Maybe she should stop. It was barely ten minutes in and he was drawing up the boundary marks, leaving very little room for her to stand. Maybe she should stop, but she thought that whatever there was between them deserved better than that. \"Ah, right. Did you move as a family?\" Tommy twitched, her questions burrowing like parasites into his flesh. He hesitated, breath hissing between his teeth as he tried, tried to be normal but then Harley tilted her head, brows furrowing in a sympathetic kinda way and he stopped trying so hard. \"Depends what you call family.\" Harley's lips quirked, pleased at the little teases she was getting, so she decided to play fair. \"Hmm. Okay. Your turn.\" She wasn't exactly an open book but clearly she was more used to this game of give and take than he was. \"Huh?\" His confused expression made her grin, and shrugged, shifting on the seat to get comfortable. \"This ain't the Spanish Inquisition, honey,\" she said lightly. \"You get a turn.\" Tommy watched her for a moment, weighing up his thoughts before turning the tables. \"Why'd you come here?\" Harley raised an eyebrow at his choice of question, a little taken aback at the ruthlessness of getting straight to the heart of the matter, but knew that if she was going to get anything out of him, she had to lead the way. \"I already told you... mum was born here. She was desperate to go back to where she grew up and since the best hospital for her type of care isn't far, I made it happen.\" She was as open as she thought the situation deserved and watched how Tommy tried to read between the lines, though it didn't reveal more than what he already knew: her mother was sick. So he tried again. \"How you long you gonna stay?\" Oh, well. Wasn't it obvious? She felt like she had it plastered on her forehead, an anchor tied around her chest that she carried everywhere she went and my god, wasn't it obvious? She hadn't offered the information before, she avoided the subject, but who the hell takes their sick parent halfway across the world to stick them in a hospital for a goddamn vacation? \"I can only be here for three months because of my ESTA.\" \"That's not what I meant.\" Tommy tilted his head, mimicking her earlier action in an almost mocking manner. \"What did you mean?\" She knew what he meant and was dumbstruck. Was he so cruel? She thought of the way he'd held her, he'd kissed her, the broken skin of his knuckles after he'd defended her, and she didn't understand. \"You know what I mean.\" His tone made her sit back, nails digging into her palms, expression hard. \"Is this how's it going to go?\" she asked in return after a long pause, words like glass. Tommy clenched his jaw and looked away, trying to ignore the alarm bells that were burning in the back of his throat. When he said nothing, Harley put down her coffee and leaned forward like she was eager to a share some otherwordly secret, the weight of her gaze forcing Tommy to turn back to her. It was then she smiled, and it was beautiful, radiant, but it held no warmth. Tommy felt struck to the bone, unsure whether it was the smile of prey resigned to being devoured, or the smile of the predator, hungry for blood. \"You want to know whether I brought my mother here to die, is that it? To be honest, I don't know. The illness isn't terminal but she wants to die so who knows whether I'll have a travelling partner on the way home. I guess I'll have to get back to you on that one, if that's okay with you.\" Not even waiting for him to acknowledge her words, Harley swung her legs round and stood up with a grace that seemed more deadly than her rage. Without looking back, she left for the front door. It took Tommy a second to realise what he had just done, the reality of the situation startling him as if he was waking from a dream, and he sprang from the couch to grab her wrist. She was radiating fury but her bones were slender and delicate beneath his calloused fingers, and he was suddenly very afraid of how badly he had hurt her. When she tried to pull away, he used his other hand to gently twist her around to face him. \"Harley, I'm - I'm sorry,\" he said - begged - the words leaving him in a rush. \"I don't know what I was doin'.\" \"You were trying to prove a point!\" she exclaimed, and he realised her hands were shaking. In the stark light of the hallway, she seemed very young. \"I don't know what you want from me, Tommy. One minute you're kissing me in the street, the next you're trying to push me away. I'm not your emotional rag doll and if you're going to treat me like one, then I'm gone.\" Tommy moved his grip from her wrist her to her hand and tugged her close. This wasn't something he was comfortable with in any sense but the idea of her just walking out that door and not coming back made him panic. He couldn't let her go, not even if it costed him the truth. \"I'm sorry,\" he breathed, trying to shake off the chains that held him. \"Seein' you here, in this place… you don't belong here, you're so much better than this shithole and I just - you're so much more than me, than all this…\" The words were thick, sticking in his mouth like sawdust and he didn't know how to say it, but then Harley sighed, shaking her head. \"You wanted to bring me down.\" Her anger sparked like an electric flame, scaling Tommy's skin but he refused to let go, preferring to suffer her fire than the ice of the absence that haunted these halls. He realised that beneath her fury was a bottomless sorrow that he had forced her to swallow, and he wanted her to know that he knew, he knew that taste of it well. \"I don't tell people shit, Harley, I don't spill my sob story like some goddamn chick flick, but you were just takin' it from me so easy and I…\" He trailed off, took a breath. \"I don't let people in, Harley. I don't talk t' people, I don't have 'em over for coffee, I don't show 'em this - any of this. But here you are, makin' me do it anyway.\" Harley sighed, swiping her hair out of her face. It was then that Tommy noticed how her makeup was smudged, purple circles heavy beneath her eyes that were red from lack of sleep, face gaunt and pale beneath the artificial light. She looked so small braced in his shadow and yet there was strength in how she held herself on the verge of shattering but refusing to break. It was like seeing her for the first time and he thought her beautiful. \"Neither do I, you know. Let people in,\" Harley replied pointedly, sounding irritated now rather than angry. \"It's hard, I get it, but I want to be with you.\" She looked away, embarrassed, and Tommy smiled despite himself. \"I'm not expecting your life story right away but you've got to work with me here. I can't do this by myself.\" \"You won't have to,\" Tommy promised quietly, determined to end the vicious circle he had fallen into. There he was, standing before a brilliant flame, a light in his shadow, and he had been ready to extinguish her fire because of, what, jealousy? Was he so far gone that he would tear her down so heartlessly, after everything she had given him? Seeing her standing there, so clean and pure amongst the filth and rubble of his past, he had felt that broken part of him twist, and like a jealous child he had tried to take from her what he couldn't have. He had wanted to hear her say it: admit that she was at the mercy of her mother's death, trapped in a long, slow procession towards the graveyard. For the smallest, darkest of moments, he had wanted to see that light dim, all because he had been desperate for someone else to feel his pain. Harley, in all her beauty and grace, had breezed into his home with a face full of pity and mouth full of charity, moving over the floorboards that were stained with his mother's blood realising they had picked the wrong house. Tommy had seen her pluck out missing photographs, scrunch her nose up the stench of bleach, appraising what she saw and finding it wanting. She had expected more and he hadn't delivered, and just for a minute, he had loathed her for her disappointment. What right did she have, he asked himself, to act like she knew better? There was tragedy in her wake but she controlled the shift of it so well that she seemed almost at ease. Yet here he was, the years he spent growing up in this house carved into the walls and she had expected him to decipher his child's scrawl; and where she had confused his invitation into his house as an invitation in his life, he had confused her courage for arrogance. And so, yet again, Tommy had erected his defences too quickly and nearly smothered out the one light that he had in his life. If he had just thought about it for two seconds, he would have known that Harley didn't feel like she was superior to him. He had seen her break, held her in his arms as she crumbled within herself and the sound of her crying had wrenched at him, so why he had so quickly pushed her towards breaking point again was beyond him. \"You don't have to tell me everything, you don't even have to tell me anything if you don't want to. I just - I want you to know that you can tell me anything, Tommy, and I won't judge you for it. If you need someone to just listen, I'm here.\" Harley looked down, fidgeting with the hem of her shirt. Who is this girl? Tomy asked himself. He ached to find out. Discarding the last of his doubts, Tommy cupped Harley's jaw, his thumb raising her chin so that he could look her in the eye. She looked up at him from under thick eyelashes and her gaze was so full of hope that the words just came out without any effort at all. \"Ma died when I was eighteen. Cancer. It was just me an' her, my brother an' Pop were still here. We left to get away from Pop an' his drinkin'. When she died, I joined the Marines an' - an' when I left, I came back here. Been to warzones an' battlefields an' towns you don't even know exist, but I ain't really been anywhere. Just the same four walls that follow me no matter where I go.\" The effect was instantaneous. The tension that had been gripping Harley's body vanished and her wary, anger-lined gaze softened into a sad yet warm smile. She tilted her head so that she was pressing against his hand and she lifted her own to run it through his messy hair. It was an intimate gesture, a gentle caress, and Tommy could only hope that she would do it again. \"I'm sorry about your mum. It's very brave of you to come back here to live with your dad, even if you had no other choice.\" She stopped and watched him for a moment; he wondered what she saw. \"Anyway, we came here to talk about us, not our pasts.\" Tommy looked at her in surprise, having expected her to push the matter. Instead, she reversed their grip so that she was now holding his hand and she led him into his own living room. They sat back down on the couch and this time Harley crossed her legs and sat facing him. \"I'll go first this time. Right.\" She took a deep breath as if to steady her nerves then looked him dead in the eye. \"This is probably hasty and reckless of me because I haven't known you for very long and I don't know you that well... but I feel like what I do know is more than enough. I was attracted to you the moment I walked through the gym door,\" she said without shame, a slight smile pulling at her lips. \"I like when we hang out. I look forward to seeing you even if I do end up making a fool of myself sometimes. I like the way you talk, the way you smile, the way you laugh. I like how even when you're really pissed off, you're still crazy-polite, like you don't know how not to be. I like how you've got all this strength but you're never rough. I like the way you light up when you're with me, when no one else is looking.\" It felt like there was a thunder storm taking place in his chest, lightening racing up and down his veins with a white-hot electricity, and all the while Harley was sat there smiling at him in that coy, mischievous, tired, warm way that she did and it was as if a flare had been lit in front of him, lighting up his darkened world with a fierce green light. In his foolishness, he had wanted to smother that fire but now it blazed so brightly before him and he wanted nothing more than to fan the flames. Tommy's thoughts were endless but words were finite and they escaped him now; how could he vocalise the tumbling, burning, pouring hurricane that had suddenly erupted just from the way she looked at him? Instead, without thinking about what he was doing, Tommy launched himself forward so that Harley was pinned beneath him, one of his hands cupping the back of her head. Harley's seawater eyes widened at his spontaneity but then he was pressing his lips against hers like the world was imploding all around them. Tommy kissed her with an almost animalistic ferocity; he kissed her like he was dying and she was his last chance at redemption. His body was hot against hers, burning through her skin as she arched up into him, arms wrapped around his neck so that she could pull him closer, and just for that moment, he and his touch were the sole reason for her existence. The Devil was in his lips, sinful and lusting and searching for more as he pressed them against her jaw, her neck, her collarbone, the bare skin of her breasts, and Harley thought that if this was Hell, even eternal damnation wouldn't suffice. When they broke apart, Harley was breathing heavily, her chest heaving against the weight of him above her. Tommy kept staring into her eyes and she knew that he was waiting for a reaction, and that no matter how strong the man against her was, she had full control over him now: her next words would either make or break him. It was a power that tasted like his lips, that felt like his hand pressing into her side. She stared unabashedly back, unable to hide her smirk. \"And I really like that.\" Tommy grinned down at her and it sent her reeling, her thoughts moving through her like whiskey. \"So is this happening? Are we...?\" Tommy shrugged then lowered his head so that his lips brushed against hers. \"We are,\" he murmured, and he kissed her again, more tender than before. He kissed her like he meant it and in the end that was all she really wanted. She could feel her body reacting to his touch and when he adjusted his position above her, she could feel his react too, and yet he did nothing more than kiss her. Harley was pretty sure that she would have done anything he asked of her in that moment but he didn't move and so neither did she. Tommy pressed his face into her neck and raked his teeth across her skin, making her moan and writhe, and she could practically feel him smirk against her. \"Bastard,\" she gasped and he laughed before capturing her in a kiss once more, biting her bottom lip when she ran her nails down his muscled back. He was built to destroy, to take down any opponent, and yet here he was, hovering above her like she was his only reason to breathe. When the fire got too much for either of them to stand, they sat up. They glanced around the room and as if looking through the same eyes, they saw that it was no longer so cold. Their heat had melted the ice and it seemed that things really did look better in candlelight after all. They stayed on the couch for a while longer, Tommy playing with a lock of her hair while Harley gave them questions to answer. Both of them felt more comfortable than they had in a long time, and they were content with just finding out the little things. Harley spoke about her home city, her love for dance and how she regretted not finishing her degree, and Tommy told her about MMA, what it was like being a Marine, and how his talent for cooking was a closely-guarded secret. They talked about silly things, things that didn't really matter, but it was those little things that really made them who they were. It was things like favourite colours, guilty pleasures, laugh out loud moments and embarrassing memories that filled in the spaces around their pasts. They didn't know it yet, but as they shared the small things, they were slowly coming to realise that it wasn't their most tragic experiences that defined him: they were more than the things they had lost. After a while, they drifted into comfortable silence. The cold had started to creep back in but they kept each other warm, and when Tommy next looked down, he found Harley asleep against his chest. She looked so calm and peaceful, the lines of her face smoothed out, and Tommy took a moment to watch her to just appreciate her stillness. Unable to bring himself to disturb her, Tommy carefully turned and slipped his other hand underneath her knees and brought her up into his arms. She stirred as he got to his feet but she didn't wake, and Tommy was able to walk through the house and gently lay her down onto his bed. He pulled his covers up over her shoulders and her breathing slowed, her body relaxing into slumber. It was so very ordinary. There was a girl sleeping in his bed. They had talked and fought and kissed and talked some more. He had made her coffee and she had made him smile. He liked her; she liked him back. And that was it. When his father came home, sober but sad, Tommy asked how he was doing. Paddy was surprised at the sincerity in his son's voice but didn't question it. He replied, a mixture of honesty and courtesy, and Tommy answered in kind. The coat over the banister didn't go unnoticed and when Tommy said that the girl from the night before was asleep in his bed because she'd had a long day, Paddy actually smiled. They slapped each other on the shoulder - awkward but passable - and bid each other good night. So very ordinary. Tommy changed into a pair of tracksuit bottoms and a plain t-shirt, then climbed onto Brendan's old bed. It didn't take him long to fall asleep listening the steady rhythm of Harley's breathing, and when his nightmares caused him to wake, it wasn't sand he saw but the smooth outline of Harley curled up in his bed. Her presence didn't keep the memories away but he found it easier to calm his panting when he knew that all he had to do was reach out and she would be there. Tommy lay back down and just as he was drifting off, he noticed that he couldn't smell the burning anymore. This chapter was rewritten on 25 August 2016. The quote in this chapter is from the song I'm Yours Tonight by The Academy Is. xo[Chapter 8] REWRITE THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) because the world is so full of death and horror i try again and again to console my heart and pick the flowers that grow in the midst of hell. – 8 – Watching her wake was like watching the sunrise and Tommy knew without a doubt that a new day had dawned. He wasn't surprised that he was the first to wake, and allowed himself a few quiet minutes to just rest in the presence of the woman in his room, before he moved to dress. Harley was serene in her slumber, one hand dangling from the side of his bed, her hair mussed and golden red for the sunlight that was beginning to peek through the curtains. Though he was mindful to be as quiet as possible, his movements in the enclosed space must have disturbed for she soon began to stir, stretching out like a cat lazing in the sun. \"Good mornin',\" he murmured. His voice cut through her fading dreams and she blinked up at the ceiling, disorientated and bleary. It took her a moment to realise where she was before her eyes landed on Tommy and all the memories from the previous night came flooding back. Something warm uncoiled in the pit of her stomach and she smiled at him, excited by the prospect of having him in her life for good, the idea a pleasant distraction from more pressing things. She was still half-asleep and the knowledge that Tommy had evidently carried her to his bed to let her stay the night made her feel a bit giddy. Tommy was taking in every single detail of the moment, trying to commit it all to memory in case it never happened again. The remains of her makeup from the day before were smudged under her eyes, her hair a tangled mess, and she had stripped off her leggings and bra sometime during the night. There was nothing chivalrous about the way his eyes darkened as she stood up, drinking in the sight before him like a thirsting man. Her plain black panties accentuated the length and smoothness of her bare legs, and he could easily make out the gentle curve of her breasts through the thin fabric of her loose shirt. Something began to ache deep down inside of him and despite all the fully naked women he had ever seen, Tommy thought she was the sexiest one he had ever seen. In the meantime, completely oblivious to Tommy's thoughts, Harley had begun to picture just how horrid she was certain she looked. She was definitely not a morning person - unless morning happened to be around 1pm - and this definitely obvious from how much of a hot mess she was when she woke up. Her hand reached up to scope out her hair (crazy and knotted, great) and her face (stiff from leftover makeup, how attractive), and she didn't even want to imagine how foul her breath must have been since she hadn't brushed her teeth before falling asleep. Harley quickly turned away from Tommy to try and hide her face, and that's when she became aware of what little clothing she had on. Closing her eyes, she mentally pleaded for Tommy to leave because just how fantastic was it that the man she fancied the socks off was getting a front row seat to the shit show that was her morning face, only a few hours after deciding to be in an are-we-are-we-not relationship with her. This was losing her serious flirtation points. \"Can I, er, use your loo - er, bathroom, please?\" Tommy swallowed, shook his head a little to clear away the lustful images in his head, and directed her towards the bathroom. She thanked him without looking back and quickly shut the door in his face. He stared at it for a moment before turning to walk into kitchen, having decided on the spot that he was going to reveal his domestic side, just for her. Cooking always made Tommy think of his mother, a bittersweet nostalgia that he enjoyed nonetheless. When he'd been a kid, his Ma had made him to stand with her in the kitchen so that he could watch and learn the motions of preparing dinner or baking a cake. It had taken him a while to get into it but by the end of it, he had looked forward to getting covered in flour, or sticking his hands into the mixing bowl. It always left him with a grin from ear to ear, a little thing that he alone had shared with his mom. When they'd left and she'd gotten sick, cooking had become his responsibility, though he still tried to find the fun in it, even when times got really rough. You'll make a good husband one day, his Ma had told him, eyes sparkling. Which lead to Harley, once she had gotten dressed and tidied herself up a bit, emerging from the bathroom to be lured into the kitchen by the smell of bacon. Immediately perking up, she traipsed into the kitchen to find Tommy standing by the hob, flipping what looked to be French toast over in a frying pan. Not wanting to interrupt him, Harley leant against the doorframe to watch him work, unashamedly admiring the view. She enjoyed the way his body moved, all power and control, never a wrong move, the streamline of his musculature visible beneath his white vest. There was a promise resting beneath that flesh, one that she wanted to taste. \"You watch me a lot,\" Tommy said, startling her from her admiration. Being caught out didn't bother her and she loped over to stand behind him, moving up onto her tiptoes so that she could see over his shoulder. She leant comfortably against his back and he became very still as if bracing himself. Smiling, she rested her chin on his shoulder and wrapped her arms around his chest, taking great enjoyment at being able to do so. Tommy could feel her breath on his neck which sent a shiver down his spine, and he forced himself to relax. There was nothing unnatural about the weight of her against him, the warmth from her skin against his, their closeness almost reassuring. As he finished up with the toast, he realised that he could be this person. No, he wanted to be this person. \"Do you want me to stop watching you?\" Harley whispered in his ear and it was difficult to suppress his shiver. When she pressed her lips against his shoulder blade, he revelled in the gentle intimacy of the moment. Harley hummed, enjoying the way he was so warm and solid beneath her touch, feeling unbelievably safe despite it all. \"Plates, cutlery?\" she asked him when he didn't reply, the barest hint of teasing in her tone. Tommy hesitated, automatically forming the words to tell her that he would take care of it and that she should just sit down, but if she kept touching him like that, he would going to burn something. So, he quickly told her where she could find what was needed, and he relaxed as she moved away to lay the table. When they finally sat down to eat, Harley made such a show of enjoying her food that Tommy couldn't help but laugh. \"Oh my God, this is amazing!\" she exclaimed, mouth full of toast and bacon. Tommy could only shrug, not used to being praised, though he was still smiling even as he tidied away their plates. When his back was turned, Harley jumped up and began to gather up the dishes and pans he'd used to cook breakfast, insisting that it was only fair when Tommy began to protest. \"You cook, I clean,\" she chirped, filling the sink up with warm water. \"You're a guest,\" Tommy argued but she just did a little half shrug, half wiggle as she flicked her hair out of her face. \"Then I better mind my manners, shouldn't I?\" Tommy rolled his eyes, having a feeling he should get used to letting her have her way. Sensing his surrender, Harley shot him a cheeky and triumphant grin over her shoulder as she moved the washed frying pan onto the drying rack. \"Bossy,\" he muttered, prompting her to flip up her middle finger with a haughty expression, though the effect was greatly diminished by the soap suds that slid lazily down her arm. Tommy snorted so she flung a palm full of dirty water at him, laughing as he effortlessly dodged her attack only to grab hold of her, his hands resting on her hips. Undeterred, Harley stuck her wet hands onto his chest, to which Tommy responded by dunking his hand in the sink and throwing a pile of bubbles onto her face, snickering when she squealed. Spotting an easy takedown, he quickly snuck his hands up her shirt, placing them flat on her back so that she arched into him to avoid the damp. \"Truce?\" he asked innocently as she squirmed against him, pouting slightly. Harley's answer was to grab Tommy by the front of his top and pull him down so that their mouths met with an eager fury, providing suitable distraction from their makeshift water fight, as well as causing bubbles to stick to Tommy's stubble which Harley found almost too cute to be true. Tommy was taken aback for a moment but then it registered that she was kissing him and so he started to move his lips against hers, his hands snaking down to cup her thighs for a moment before he lifted her up and placed her on the counter. Water soaked through her leggings but Harley didn't even notice because he started to trail burning touches down her jaw and neck, gently sucking on her skin and grazing his teeth against it as he pressed his fingertips into her back, his thumb coming round to stroke under the edge of her bra. In response, Harley wrapped her legs around his waist, linking them at the ankle, and she could feel him pressing against her - and it was silly but even that slight pressure made her breathless and hot and lost in his depths, and suddenly she was drowning in him, his searching, strong hands the only thing keeping her from crumbling. She moaned, perhaps too loudly for that time of the morning, but Tommy only let out a wordless grumble against her neck in response and placed an open-mouthed kiss on her pulse point, feeling the rush of her heartbeat beneath his lips. He felt drunk, somewhere between being grounded and weightless, as if he were caught in the tide that dragged him back and forth against the shore. It made him feel powerful and small all at once, and he wasn't sure who was holding up who anymore. He wanted to touch her, taste her, hear her scream his name, and his fingers travelled up to her bra clasp, ready to strip her of that shirt when he sensed movement behind him. \"Jesus, fuck,\" Harley cursed as she spotted their audience over Tommy's shoulder; quickly she uncrossed her legs and pushed at Tommy's chest so she could slide off the counter. Her cheeks went pink and she swallowed nervously, looking away from the man who was standing in the kitchen doorway watching the couple with an unfathomable look. Tommy moved his grip so that his hands were gently resting on Harley's waist, and he turned to face his father, not yet sure whether he was annoyed or embarrassed at the interruption. \"Sorry, I - I came to get some coffee,\" Paddy said quietly. Tommy nodded and stepped to the side, bringing Harley with him so that she was kept half out of sight at all times, though he wasn't really sure why he felt the need to. Paddy hesitantly walked across towards the coffee pot and began to pour himself a cup; the tension in the air was tangible and a million degrees of awkward. \"So, um, you're the girl from the other night.\" It was a rocky start but the old man was trying to make conversation and even though Harley wanted nothing more than to scarper, he looked too sad and worn for her to ignore. \"Yes, Sir, I am,\" she replied even though it wasn't a question, half out of habit, half out of politeness. After all, if she was hoping to remain in Tommy's life for the foreseeable future, it wasn't a bad idea to play nice with his dad. Tommy glanced down at her, watching the way she held herself, the way her lips shaped around her pale words. \"And you stayed the night?\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"You with Tommy?\" Harley sneaked a look at the man in question whose his features had set in a hard, defensive line; she smiled. \"Yes, Sir.\" Her quick response took Tommy by surprise and his expression softened when he gazed down at her, a tiny smile pulling at one corner of his lips which were still slightly swollen from their fierce, eager kissing. Paddy gave them a meagre wave as he disappeared upstairs and the pair waited a moment until they heard his door close before moving. Harley couldn't help it and burst out laughing, slightly hysterical as she threw her face into her hands and shook her head in disbelief. \"I felt like we were teenagers!\" she exclaimed and Tommy laughed, ruffling her hair before moving away. He quickly wiped a cloth over the counter to soak up all the water they had splashed around while Harley straightened her clothing, still blushing from the encounter with Tommy's father. In a weak attempt to change the subject, she asked Tommy what he was planning on doing for the day. \"Gonna go check in at the gym,\" he told her, throwing the damp cloth into the sink. \"Need a lift somewhere?\" \"Yeah, if you don't mind. I better go see my mum for a bit, make sure she's okay. Erm, thanks for letting me stay over,\" she said, coming over a tad shy. Tommy just smiled. Half an hour later, Harley leaned over to drop a kiss onto Tommy's check before she climbed out of the car. He didn't move or reciprocate the gesture but when he leant his forearms on the steering wheel as he watched her walk up to the hospital entrance, he noticed the little swagger in the sway of her hips, the way her shoulders were held back and her back straight. Harley was determined to have a good day and dammit, so was he. It seemed that Harley's good mood was catching. When she arrived at the ward, there were no screams echoing through the halls, the lights seemed softer and the scent of disinfectant was less noticeable than usual - even the nurses were smiling as she approached them. \"She's good today,\" one said, gesturing towards Lily's room. Harley's heart swelled a little in hope and she hurried over to the doorway, only to stop dead when she saw her mother sitting up against the headboard, a book in her hands. \"Mum?\" she called, timid. Lily looked up and gave her daughter a smile so bright. \"Come here, gorgeous girl,\" she beckoned, moving her book to the side, and Harley stumbled forward, overwhelmed at the unexpected gift of seeing her mother so lucid and calm when she had told herself that such moments were gone. She lay her head on her mother's chest, wrapping her arms around her as tight as she dared and just held on for dear life. \"It's okay, honey, it's okay,\" Lily cooed, stroking her daughter's wild, messy waves, and for a little while, neither of them spoke until Harley couldn't hold it back any longer and began to weep. She scrunched her eyes up tight and the cries wracked through her, painful and exhausting. \"I miss you,\" she choked out, struggling to draw in enough breath to calm herself down. Lily continued to stroke her hair, dropping a gentle kiss on her temple as Harley pulled back enough to stare up at her mother. \"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry. Things were never meant to turn out this way.\" \"I just - I just want you to be okay,\" Harley confessed, eyes burning as she dragged the back of her hand across them. Her throat was tight and it felt like there was something catching beneath her ribcage but there was joy here, joy that she had never expected to feel again. \"Baby, as long as you are okay, so am I. Don't worry about me, I've lived my life, I've had my time. You've got the whole world ahead of you, I don't want you to throw that away.\" \"But you're my mum, of course I'm going to take care of you, after everything you've done for me,\" Harley argued, not noticing when a nurse quietly closed the door, giving the pair some privacy. \"Harley, it doesn't matter where I am or where life takes you, I'm always going to be your mother. Nothing and no one on this good earth can change that, you know that.\" With her dark mahogany hair curling around her shoulders, her pale skin and dark eyes, Lily appeared to be more than her years, aged and ruined by the path she had walked but yet there was love and light within her gaze, untouched by the dark years of her life. Harley hoped that no matter what life threw at her, she would always find the same softness within herself. \"But, mum -\" \"Baby, look at where you have been. You were always so defiant, so full of that wonderful fire I saw within you from the moment you were born. You did everything you could to keep us safe, to give us a good life, and I'm sorry that the responsibility of protecting this family feel on your shoulders, baby girl, but I am so proud of you. I always knew that you would find your way to better things.\" Even as Harley buried her face in her hands, Lily kept her voice light but firm: she needed her daughter to know these things before the thoughts in her head were lost forever. The long war she had been waging against her own mind, against the things that broke it, was coming to an end and she needed Harley to hear the things she had never had the chance to say before - before it was too late. \"Just promise me one thing, okay? Don't ever give up. Don't let anyone take that fire away from you. People are going to be jealous of it, scared even, and are going to try to take it from you but don't ever let them - and one day, you're going to find someone you loves you and that fire, and you are going to have a beautiful, wonderful, happy life, you hear? Everything's going to be okay, Harley, it will. I know it.\" Harley had nothing to say in response, could only wipe her tears and remember that she was determined to have a good day. Deciding to not ruin the moment, she picked up the book her mum had been reading and began to read it out loud, letting her mother close her eyes and drift away into a gentle sleep. For a brief second, Harley was terribly afraid to let Lily sleep for fear that she would never have a moment like this again, but then she thought that maybe it was okay. So she continued to read, long into the day. It was a warm afternoon, the streets quiet. Harley had briefly considered calling Tommy for a lift as the distance from the hospital to anywhere of interest was sizeable but decided against it, thinking that the solitary walk would do her good. She took her time, appreciating the need not to rush. Colt's apartment had been her original destination but it was closer to walk to the gym and she figured Tommy would be about finishing up when she passed by. Her timing was pretty much spot on as she arrived, stepping into the foyer just as he was walking out of the hall, his gym bag in his hand. Colt was visible from his office, gesturing angrily as he talked to someone on the phone. Ignoring him, Harley shot a smile at Tommy, liking the warm feeling she got when she looked at him. \"Hey,\" he greeted her, voice gruff, as he put a slightly damp around around her shoulders to pull her in for a quick kiss. Surprised but pleased at the easy intimacy, Harley slid her arm around his waist, revelling in the warmth he exuded. \"Hi. Good session?\" she asked, catching sight of Colt turning in his seat to stare at them, the phone still plastered to his ear. She gave him a quick wave as Tommy guided them out the door towards his car, then heat in the air still lingering despite the fading light. \"Yeah, usual. You? How was… everythin'?\" His sidestepping was sweet, endearing. \"It was, erm, good.\" Tommy glanced down at her tone, trying to judge what she was thinking. \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah,\" she nodded as they climbed into the car. \"She was awake… and lucid. It's been a long time since we've actually been able to hold a proper conversation, y'know?\" Tommy did know. He remembered how his mom's grasp on reality had faded in and out towards the end: sometimes she would wake up in the night, not knowing where she was, who he was. She would call out for her husband, begging him to help her, and Tommy would be left, sitting on the cold floor, unable to tell his sick mother that Paddy of all people was not going to save her. Except he couldn't say that, didn't know how to form the words, so instead he rested his hand on her thigh and squeezed a little. Harley laid her hand on top of his and he thought that maybe she understood. Looking out the window he saw that the sun was beginning to set, the golden reds and pinks blotting the sky and, with his mother still in mind, he had an idea. Without saying anything, he drove them to a little spot by the park where he'd come with his mom before they'd left. \"What's this?\" Harley asked, intrigued. Tommy waited until he'd walked round to open her door to let her out, his hand resting automatically on the small of her back as he led them down to the stream, before he answered. \"I used to come here a lot with Ma,\" he replied as they picked out a bench. There was nothing around except green, the gentle gurgle of water that only thing to disturb them. \"When we just needed to get away from it all. From him.\" He knew he didn't have to clarify for Harley to understand: their history had been hung like shredded banners within the confines of his childhood house. \"It's pretty.\" \"Yeah,\" Tommy agreed with a sigh. \"It is.\" They were silent for a long while, each of them sinking into self reflection as the sun sunk deep down behind the trees. \"It's an odd thing, watching the end come,\" Harley said a while later. Tommy startled, stared down at her. She was staring off into the distance and spoke as if she wasn't really there. \"When you've been fighting against it for so long, but it comes anyway. And you kinda knew it would, deep down, but didn't ever admit it to yourself because then what would be the point in fighting?\" Tommy saw himself washing the sweat off his mother's forehead with a dirty cloth, shushing her pained whimpers as the landlord banged on the door. We're not here, he would whisper, only pennies in his pocket. We're not here, she would whisper back, blood dotting her blue lips. \"I've spent my whole life protecting her, keeping her safe, because she's my mum, and for a long time she was my whole world. There was always something… something I had to fight, always one thing after the other. And I would always win, in the end, but then the next thing would come along… and then the next thing… and here we are.\" We're not here, we're not here. His mom would repeat that over and over until it would just sound, until she would choke on the words. Before he knew the weight of a gun in his hand, Tommy knew blood. He knew blood and sweat and would spent hours scrubbing at the bedsheets to get rid of it until his fingers were raw. \"After everything, I never really pictured a world where it was just me. I always had her, no matter what. The nurses keep calling me a 'survivor' but fuck that. I don't want to survive my mother, I don't want to be the last one left standing.\" Blood and sweat and sand, and a pile of the dead that never stops burning. He could build a coffin with his eyes closed, could name every requiem in the hymn books because my god, he has sung them all. \"She asks me whether I think she'll go to Heaven.\" Harley huffs out a laugh, but it's hollow. \"Like it matters what I think. If I had any say, she'd be the first one up there, ringing the damn bell to those pearly gates, but I can't bear the thought of believing in Heaven, I can't.\" There were tiny bottles of holy water littering her bedside table, however many he could carry in his pockets. His Ma would pray for the Lord to help her, her arms stretching as far as they could reach towards the ceiling as if begging for Him to reach down and pluck her from the world, but not even the holy water would stifle her fever. \"I can't believing in Heaven because then I'd have to believe in Hell but how can I believe in the idea that there is a fate worse than this?\" There was a part of Tommy that furiously angry. He wasn't entirely sure why but the rage rose within him like a wave and he had to walk away. Harley didn't watch him go, just kept staring at the bubbling water, not quite sure whether she'd spoken at all, the words having appeared from nowhere. But she'd hurt Tommy somehow and with that realisation came an understanding. Tommy was a survivor. Harley had lived a hard life but Tommy knew loss like it was his currency, paid in too many pounds of flesh. There, by the water and the trees, she could scent the death on him. It, and the painfully human instinct to overcome it, burned like incense. He walked with a weight no man should bear, and Harley wondered how many corpses he carried on his shoulder. It took a while but he finally came back, sitting down next to her as if afraid she would starting shouting. He radiated emotion but Harley couldn't pinpoint which one, so entangled and ensnared they were within his skeleton that she wasn't sure even he knew. \"It's okay, I think, fighting an end you know is going to come,\" Harley said lightly, as if he had never left, though he knew she was speaking as much for him as for herself. \"When I held my mum today, I realised something. It's not about winning the fight. It's about having something to fight for.\" This chapter was rewritten on 29 August 2016. The quote in this chapter is from the book Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse. xo[Chapter 9] REWRITE THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) a mermaid found a swimming lad picked him for her own pressed her body to his side, laughed; and plunging down forgot in cruel happiness that even lovers drown – 9 – It was getting late but the warmth lingered in the evening air, birds chirping and the water lapping at the bank. Harley's words hung like autumn leaves caught in the breeze and Tommy's anger crackled with a luminosity his dreams did not possess. \"There ain't no fightin' left for me,\" he murmured. \"Mine are all lost.\" He stared hard at the landscape before him: the slope down into the water, the houses littered at the foot of the park, the clouds rolling in. He felt rather than saw Harley look at him then shake her head. \"That's not true,\" she argued. \" Of course that's not true. If you've lost the fight, then what the hell are you still here for?\" Tommy was surprised at the hurt that bloomed in his chest at her question and he quickly crossed his arms in defence of himself, uncomfortable with the spotlight she was shining onto him. \"Says someone who ain't lost any,\" he snapped back meanly, immediately feeling guilty when a wave of unbearable sadness flashed across her face. \"If only,\" she breathed, before continuing louder. \"Thing is, when you lose the fight, you just find another. Otherwise what's the point, and there's got to be a point, right? There's got to be a reason for everything, for all this shit that gets thrown at us. There's got to be a reason that someone as good and kind as my mum, who fought so hard to survive, would be destined to live out her freedom in a hospital bed. Right? There has to be. There has to be. \" Hearing the fervour with which she spoke, the passion in her voice that burned so fiercely, Tommy felt like such an ass having tried, yet again, to bring her down. Here she was, beaten so badly by a hard, unfair life, and yet she was still finding something to believe in despite it all, and even if he had given up believing in anything a long time ago, he was suddenly painfully afraid that she would lose that faith and crumble into the ash he had long since become accustomed. He wanted her to keep that innocence and so he forced himself to relax, letting his arms stretch across the bench behind her. Harley unabashedly turned into his chest and he pulled her close, his hand resting protectively on her shoulder as she leant against his. \"I know I talk a load of shit sometimes,\" she said after a moment with a laugh and Tommy smiled, eyes crinkling at the corners. \"But I don't think you really believe you've lost the fight. You're a goddamn cage fighter! If anyone is fighting the good fight, it's you.\" Tommy shook his head but didn't disagree, not wanting to ruin the moment (again). Instead he just peered down at the girl in his arms. He didn't know her history but there was too much hope within her for her to have experienced the loss that haunted him, and fuck , was he thankful, but where was she heading? He had his past and she had her future, and there were one and the same - and what then? What would happen as she continued to travel this path she had been forced to walk, where would that hope go? When she no longer believed that there was some big purpose behind all the suffering, who would she become? They hadn't known each other for very long but already she was taking over him. Where he had nothing but ash remaining, she still burned, forest green among the bleached sand that weighed in his dreams. She was perched perilously on the cusp of tragedy and he found himself desperate to keep her standing, keep her laughing and living and light. He had never known that he needed her in his life but now that she was here, filling every dark recess, he couldn't be without her. If she had to believe there was a point to all this, then fine: he would be her reason, and where she emitted light, he would consume the dark, existing in unexpected balance. And so, in less than a handful of seconds, Tommy had committed everything - and Jesus, she didn't even know. He studied her profile, the elegant curve her neck, the wild curl of her dark hair around her shoulders. His calloused fingers traced her jawline, making her shiver. \"I wanna take you out,\" he told her, and she turned to look at him, surprised. \"What, like a date?\" \"Yeah. I can do the romantic thing once in awhile,\" he teased and she grinned, visibily happy. \"Okay, yeah! I haven't been on a proper date in forever,\" she gushed, and Tommy laughed, dropping a kiss onto the top of her hair, giving her a little squeeze. He still couldn't quite believe how comfortable he was around her, how easy it was for him to be that guy - how badly he wanted to be him for her. \"Where are you going to take me, then?\" \"Leave that up to me,\" he said, moving to a stand, pulling Harley up along with him. They walked like that back to the car, all entangled together, not quite ready to pull apart. It didn't feel forced, which surprised both of them, so used they were to the lonely life; their hips jostled with each step, their fingers clasped, and Tommy felt like he had butterflies in his stomach (though he'd never admit that out loud) as if he was nervous and excited all at once. The drive to Colt's wasn't long so when Tommy pulled up to the sidewalk, he let the car idle for a bit, his hand on top of where Harley's rested on his thigh. When he looked over at her, he saw that the fire in her eyes had cooled, her expression closed as she stared distractedly out the window into the falling night. \"Hey,\" he said gently. \"You okay?\" Harley turned with a smile, running a hand through her hair. \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just thinking about things.\" At Tommy's questioning quirk of an eyebrow, she continued. \"It was really good seeing my mum today, being able to talk to her like normal, but it's made me realise that I really need to decide what my next step is going to be. I've been procrastinating,\" she said with a sigh, shrugging a little. \"Oh, hey, I was going to ask: what's happening with the flat? I mean, apartment?\" It was Tommy's turn to sigh and shrug. \"I've been procrastinatin' myself,\" he told her. \"I spoke with the landlord the other day an' he's still happy with my offer…\" He trailed off, scratching the back of his neck as he thought about what he was going to do. Harley laughed after a moment, moving into his space to kiss his cheek. \"Look at us,\" she giggled. \"Weight of the world on our shoulders and neither of us can make a damn decision!\" Tommy huffed a laugh, shaking his head as he pulled Harley back to him before she could slip away, enjoying the way his hands fit against her waist, the sensation of her hair against his cheek. Their kiss started chaste but quickly heated, Harley's arms wrapped around his neck and his hand splayed on the small of her back beneath her shirt, and it was only when the windscreen started to fog that Harley broke the kiss, hiding her face in the crook of his neck as she laughed. \"We're making out like teenagers,\" she exclaimed, her laughter infectious as Tommy let her sit back, unable to disagree. \"Ain't it fun?\" he drawled, enjoying the way her cheeks were flushed, pupils wide as she swallowed thickly, gazing at him hard. She licked her lips, Tommy's eyes flicking down to stare at her mouth, and she laughed again, this time the sound a little husky. \"Oh, definitely.\" Then she winked and opened her door, taking a moment to lay her hand on his chest. \"For what it's worth, I think you should take the apartment,\" she said before getting out the car. Tommy leant across and grabbed her hand before she could straighten, holding her down long enough to retort. \"An' I think you should stay.\" Harley smiled, the heat replaced by genuine warmth, showing that she understood what he meant. \"Deal,\" she agreed, before closing the door behind her and heading over to Colt's place. Tommy watched her go inside, waiting until the front door was shut before he drove home. The place on his thigh where her hand had been felt cold; his bottom lip where she had gently bit him burned hot. He thought about what she'd said down by the stream, the anger he'd felt, the fear. Tommy had spent a long time believing that the choices he had made, the choices that had been made for him, had pushed him towards a single irrevocable fate. Desperate to drown the demons that haunted him, he had become lost at sea, doomed to drift alone with nothing but salt water and the dark sky to comfort him. But then Harley had clapped her hands and just like that, the light had come on. Maybe, despite everything, Harley had been right: she hadn't lost the fight - and, as it turned out, neither had he. The sound of knocking on his door startled Tommy from his hazy dreams with a jolt. He sat up, glancing around the room without realising he was doing so, before frowning at the direction of the banging. He was forming the words in his throat to tell the person to fuck off when he noticed the relentless knocking had some sort of light hearted tune to it. \" Tommyyyyyy!\" Harley sung from behind the door, sound far too cheery considering the time. Still, Tommy couldn't help but smile to himself as he got of bed, trying to press down his mess of hair with one hand, adjusting his loose tracksuit bottoms with the other as he made his way to the front door. When he opened it, Harley was stood there, grinning from ear to ear with a tub of paint in each hand and a pack of paint brushes sticking out of her front pocket. She was dressed in a crop top with dark dungarees, and looked absolutely ridiculous, and Tommy was so fiercely grateful she was in his life. \"Let's get paintin'!\" she drawled in an atrocious mock southern accent, and Tommy rolled his eyes as he stepped aside to let her through. She giggled to herself and put down the paint, turning to survey the apartment with critical eyes and hands on her hips. Tommy meanwhile eyed the paint colours, wondering how she knew what to pick up. \"Since you didn't seem sure how long you're gonna stay here for, I picked up neutral colours in case you decide to sell or whatever,\" Harley said without looking at him as if reading his thoughts. \"I got caramel sand for the living area and summer ivory for the rest of the walls. I thought you might wanna pick an actual colour for your bedroom, but that's up to you. Right, come on then, get dressed!\" she commanded, clapping her hands together. \"An' here I thought I'd left the Corp,\" Tommy muttered then winced as Harley smacked him on the arm, apparently having heard him. He shot her a sheepish grin and she pointed towards his bedroom with a scowl, leaving no room for protest as he gave in and went to get changed. When he came back out a couple minutes later, Harley was carrying a huge box of his shit through the tiny hallway, teetering a little as she navigated the boots he had left sprawled by the radiator. \"Harley, put that - Harley! Put that down, would ya?\" he called, rushing forward to try and pluck it from her arms when she wheeled around, moving away from him with an exaggerated eye roll. \"I've got it!\" she sung over her shoulder as she dropped the box onto the kitchen counter. \"You need to wake up and smell the twenty first century coffee, my friend. Girls can lift things now,\" she quipped as he went to scold her for lifting the heavy stuff. Tommy just shook his head, knowing that arguing would just be counterproductive, and instead just cast her another appraising look as she adjusted her messy ponytail: somehow she'd already managed to get dirt on her nose and she had a flush across her cheeks from her struggle with the box, and the whole thing was just so perfect that Tommy had to take a moment to catch his breath. Oblivious, Harley turned the radio as loud as she dared to some country station, then began to set up shop in the middle of the lounge on top of the old sheets Tommy had found in his Pop's place. Together they taped up the edges, organised the brushes and picked out the wall to be targeted first. Just as the sun began to shine bright and crisp through the windows, they started to paint with lazy strokes. Their conversation was light and airy - at least, it was until Harley decided that light and airy conversation was boring, and that it was much more amusing to flick paint at Tommy's head. The way that he froze, turning slowly to give her a stone cold glare was enough to send her into a fit of laughter, which was cut off abruptly when Tommy, with his lightning fast reflexes, ran his paint brush across her cheek, leaving a crisp line of summer ivory in its wake. Suddenly it was game on, and they pair of them began to dart around the apartment, chasing each other with paint and laughter. Tommy knew they were acting like fools but he also knew that he hadn't had this much fun in so long that he could barely recall it. Chasing Harley around as she laughed so hard that she could barely breath brought him a sense of exhilaration - something that normally only happened during a fight, and this was so much better than sweat and blood and fists. \"Aren't you meant to be letting me win?\" Harley flung over her shoulder as she navigated the living room, and Tommy answered by leaping forward to sweep her up into his arms. She was giggling, speckled head to toe in paint, and so staggeringly beautiful that Tommy felt breathless. Harley noticed his expression and went to ask him what was wrong when he was kissing her, hard and hungry. She was startled only for a heartbeat before her body took over, and she threw her arms around his neck, fingers twisting into his messy hair, digging into his shoulders. When he nipped at her lower lip, she moaned deep in her throat, a sound that surprised her but only seemed to spur Tommy on as he moved towards the breakfast counter, sat her down onto it only to reposition her legs so that he was stood in between them. Enjoying the way he was taking control, seemingly already naturally attuned to her body, Harley brought her legs up around his waist so they were flush together, and kissed him back with all the passion he stirred up in her. His tongue was hot in her mouth, her breasts heaving against his chest, and she felt dizzy, drunk on the man in her arms. Pulling away for a second, Tommy looked down at her, lips swollen, hair a mess, and slid his hands along her thighs to lift her up from the counter. \"You're so fuckin' hot,\" he whispered in her ear, sending a shiver down her spine, and she could only moan in reply. When he started to kiss her neck, his heavy lips sucking at the sensitive skin of her pulse point, she felt like she was going to combust, lust and heat and anticipation all roiling around within her like a starved animal. \"God, Tommy,\" she groaned, clinging to him so tight that she could feel him hard and thick at her crotch, pressing against her in a way that made her head spin, and she was overcome by the desire for him to take her right there on the counter, and she knew he wanted it to from the way he held her, moaned her name like it was a curse and a prayer, all she needed to do was - And there it was, that annoyingly sensible part of her mind that knew this was too soon, too fast. She'd been here before and no matter how good - how damn good - it felt, it always ended badly and she liked Tommy too much to risk losing him over a moment of lust. \"Tommy,\" she murmured, unwinding her legs from his waist, but he didn't move, continuing to kiss and nip at her neck and jawline and for a second she forgot why she was trying to put a stop to this. Sighing, she tried again, and this time pushed on his shoulders a little. This got his attention and he quickly pulled away, his expression anxious as he surveyed her. The seriousness of his gaze compared to the complete dishevelment of them both made Harley smile. \"You okay?\" he asked, unsure, and she nodded, trying to seem reassuring because she couldn't quite find the words to explain what was going through her head. Whatever he saw her in her eyes appeared enough to settle him though because he relaxed, and returned her smile. After rolling his shoulders like he was trying to shake away the moment, he held out a hand and lead her back to the living room. \"Nearly done,\" he said lightly, and together they continued to paint the room as the sun passed through the sky. Once they had finished painting, they rearranged some of the furniture and finished unpacking Tommy's belongings - what little he had, anyway. By the time evening fell, the place was done; if not fantastic, his. It had been a long time since Tommy'd had space to himself without sharing it with someone - his brother, his mum, his unit, Manny, Pop. After years of being alone, he really was finally by himself. The thought might have depressed him but then Harley was there, handing him a bottle of beer as the last rays of sunlight caught her wild eyes, lighting them up. \"Let me take ya out t'night,\" he said as he took the beer. \"I owe you that date.\" Harley grinned and tucked her hair behind her ears, looking a little nervous but pleased. \"Sure, yeah. That sounds perfect. It can be a celebratory dinner.\" \"What we celebratin'?\" he asked, quirking an eyebrow. \"That you're still fighting,\" she replied, smiling, and Tommy wondered whether winning a million dollars would have felt anywhere near as good as this moment. He didn't know how to respond, so he gently tilted her face up and kissed her softly. It was a tender thing, and he felt broken and remade in the same moment. Languid, they pulled apart and the air was lighter, somehow. Feeling equally undeserving and selfish, they both knew they should turn away but were unable to do so. They wanted to protect themselves but they wanted each other more, and there was something exciting in that defiance. Harley left soon after to get ready for their date, hopping into Colt's shower as soon as she could, thanking her lucky stars that her host was still not back from work. The feel of the hot water thundering against her shoulders, washing away the paint but never the imprint of Tommy's hands, soothed her into a lull that had her drifting slowly around the guest room as she picked out her outfit, feeling dangerously content. In the end she settled for a deep red dress with a floaty hem that settled at her knees, plus some casual black ankle boots and a choker necklace. Not really having much in the way of makeup, she did the best she could with cheap mascara and lipstick, then pulled her hair back into a quick fishtail braid just in time for the doorbell to go. \"He's here,\" she hummed to herself, feeling nervous despite herself. Taking her time to grab her coat and bag so she didn't appear flustered, Harley opened the door to see Tommy leaning against the opposite wall of the corridor, hands tucked into the pockets of his dark jeans, his long-sleeved midnight blue shirt only slightly rumpled. His head was tilted to the side as if he was deep in thought, and his hair was ruffled as if he had just been running his hands through it, and she had to take a moment just to survey him, enjoying the sight. \"Hey,\" she murmured to catch his attention, and his gaze snapped to her like a crack of lightning and it was as bright as one too. \"Hey,\" he replied, husky and low, and Harley nearly damned swooned right there in the hallway like a teenager. Worth it, she thought to herself. \"You look beautiful,\" he added, moving to stand before her with his hand held out for her to take. She smiled - had she stopped at all today? - and took his hand, letting him lead her down to his car. \"You look pretty handsome yourself,\" she replied belatedly as he held open the door. He raised an eyebrow at her delay before quirking a boyish grin, a lock of hair flopping in front of his eyes, reminding Harley of a puppy. Dear God, she thought, I am so screwed. They didn't talk much in the car, both of them too nervous and excited to appear cool, but it didn't take long to get to the restaurant and Tommy kept his hand on her thigh the whole ride, enough to distract Harley from any otherwise awkward silence. When they arrived, Tommy came round to open her door and help her out, earning a pleased smile that had him sending her smirk that was full of promise, enough to make heat bloom in the pit of her belly. They were greeted by the maitre d' who quickly escorted them to their table which was seated by the window. The ceiling was vaulted but the room still felt cosy and warm, tea lights spotted here and there, and a single white rose stood in a small vase between them. Outside, Harley could see the city lights reflected in the streets damp with summer rain, the moon watercolour in the ink-blotted sky, and everything combined made her feel as if she had fallen away from her everyday life into a sidewalk chalk painting, and she was so very glad. \"This place is gorgeous,\" she exclaimed, unable to hold it in, and Tommy grinned, pleased - this whole romance thing wasn't exactly his forte but he seemed to have pulled it off so far. He continued to watch her as she skimmed the menu, saw the way her nose scrunched up in contemplation, her teeth snagging her bottom lip. The candlelight made her hair seem red, her eyes burning green, almost preternatural, wisps of her hair curled around her jawline and he couldn't help but wonder what the fuck he had done to earn this moment. Jesus Christ, he was on a date. It was almost laughable, but here he was. Sat in a fancy shirt with a beautiful woman in some romantic as hell restaurant, and he was absolutely fuckin' terrified. He could count on one hand how many times he had cared this much, had tried this hard for another person - and each time, when he had, they had left. Whether by choice or by death, no matter how much he put into it, he had been the last one left standing and the concept of putting it all on the line again (again, again, again) froze him to the core. \"Good evening! Would you like to hear the specials?\" Tommy startled as the waiter appeared at his elbow and he had to clench down on the menu in his hands tight to stop himself from flinching. Harley, unaware, nodded at the young man, smiling sweetly when he tripped over his words, the tips of his ears red, and Tommy scowled, wishing just a little bit she wasn't so nice all the time. When Harley looked back at him once she had finished ordering her drink - a glass of rose, he noted for future reference - he forced his expression to relax before ordering a beer. \"God, I am starving,\" she confessed as the waiter left them, and she went back to studying the menu as she curled a loose strand of hair around her finger. Normally Tommy hated when people fidgeted because it put him on edge, but in Harley he found it endearing. Jesus, he thought. I am so fucked. \"Order whatever,\" he said with a shrug and it was Harley's time to smirk. \"Sure okay, I'm thinking… yes, how about the lobster… with a bottle of champagne… ooh, is that oysters?\" she said greedily, making a show of flapping the menu around and Tommy laughed, relaxing a little in his seat. In the end, Harley picked a chicken dish while Tommy went for the steak - what? he was craving protein - and just as he started to worry what they would talk about, Harley led them into easy conversation that had time fading away. Once or twice, Tommy said something that made Harley throw her head back in laughter, revealing the gentle curve of her neck that Tommy craved to press his lips against, imagined her arch up into him, that low moan he'd heard earlier still echoing in the back of his mind. Just thinking about it made him shift in his seat, so when it was time for them to go, Tommy threw down some notes and helped Harley into her coat as fast as he dared. From her quiet chuckle, his efforts weren't going unnoticed. The waiter bid them farewell as they left, his eyes caught on the sway of Harley's hips as they walked by and Tommy speared him with a vicious glare that had the boy stumbling away, and Harley sniggering into his shoulder. \"Oh, stop,\" she teased, earning a dry look that only had her laughing louder. The sound echoed through the still night and the light of the moon was bright in her wake as she headed towards his car. When he went to open her door, she turned into him, her hands on his chest, and peered up at him with those eyes that drove him fucking crazy. Her lips were slightly parted, her pupils wide, and his skin burned where she was touching him. \"Thank you for a great night,\" she whispered, her gaze dropping to his lips, and she had barely gotten the words out before he had pulled her into a deep kiss that she returned with an eagerness he felt all the way down to his groin. Her hands were in his hair, her tongue was in his mouth, and his hips were pressing against hers without inhibition and - \"Get a room!\" Harley jumped back just as Tommy whirled to snarl fuck off at the group of guys who were walking past, making them slink away, and when he turned back Harley was almost bent over double laughing. He couldn't help but shake his head and smile, even if he was annoyed they'd been interrupted. \"Take me home,\" she commanded with a wink when she had straightened up and Tommy was more than happy to obey her, helping her climb into the seat before he was darting around to drive them back to his new apartment. The air inside the car was so thick that it was hard to breathe - until Harley decided that they were being far too serious. She leaned over to switch on the radio, and was delighted at the song that was playing. \" Whoa-ohhhh, livin' on a prayer! Take my haaaand, we'll make it, I swear! Whoa-oh, livin' on a praaaayer!\" she sang, dancing in her seat like a fool, refusing to look at Tommy until she could feel him laughing beside her, fingers tapping almost triumphantly against the steering wheel in time to the beat. \"You're crazy,\" he decided, but she just shrugged, enjoying herself as she launched into the next song (\"I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life on youuuuu\"). Still amused, Tommy didn't interrupt her singing as they approached the road he should turn into to drop Harley off; he slowed down but didn't turn and he half-watched Harley out of the corner of his eye to observe her reaction as he drove past the road completely. Her gaze flickered to him but she didn't show any indication of protest so he relaxed and continued on back to his apartment. Harley only quietened as he pulled in the parking lot, and they were both in silence as he turned off the engine. Neither of them made a move to get out, and Harley stared out at the moon, her expression hard to read. When the moment got too long, he rested her hand on her thigh to catch her attention, then slowly climbed out of the car, pleased that she followed. Together they walked the stairs up to his place, sharing small, knowing smiles as they did so. Tommy kept waiting for it to become awkward, but it never did. \"Nice place,\" Harley commented as he let them in, making a show of appreciating the decor. Tommy rolled his eyes, throwing his coat over the back of the couch. \"I had help from a woman I met,\" he admitted, playing along. \"Oh yeah? What was she like?\" Harley asked with guile, walking towards him slowly, deliberately. \"Beautiful,\" he replied, emphatic. \"Smart, honest, funny… sexy as hell.\" His voice was low and Harley had the look of lust in her eye, head tilted down, eyes peering up at him as she came to a stop before him. Her hands splayed across his chest, moving down, feeling the contours of his collarbone, his pecs, his stomach, his hips. Heat was radiating from her, from him, as he bent his head to capture her in a kiss that began soft but quickly lost any tenderness as she arched into him, his hands slipped down to lift her lightly into his arms, her legs wrapping around his waist, a perfect continuation from earlier. \"Tommy,\" she murmured in his ear, breathing heavily, \"fuck, Tommy.\" That was all the encouragement he needed; he quickly strode to the bedroom, refusing to put Harley down as he kicked open the door and laid her down on the bed. Her head fell back, eyes closed, and he took it as an invitation to press hot kisses down her throat, teeth nipping, tongue wet as he tasted her skin, the feel of her pulse hammering beneath his lips. He brushed aside her wild, dark tresses and began to kiss down from her throat to her breasts, pushing down the top of her dress to reveal her bra; he could see the outline of her nipples, and he mouthed against the fabric that covered them, causing Harley to moan, deep. Tommy grinned wickedly at the sound he was eliciting from her, and sat back to just take a moment and watch her, revel in the moment: her dress, the perfect shade against the paleness of her skin, had ridden up around her thighs, allowing him a delicious view of her panties and the arousal there; she shifted uncomfortably, biting her lip as she opened her eyes to stare at him impatiently. \"Tommy,\" she whined and he laughed, eyes so dark they were almost black, and moved them both forward until she was lying flat on the bed, his body a heavy but safe weight over her. He kissed her again slowly, once, twice, until she was almost shivering with anticipation. \"What d'ya want, baby?\" he asked, his voice more of a rumble against her ear than sound, and Harley could barely think straight as she spread her legs a subtle inch, opening herself upon beneath him, her heart beating so hard she thought it would burst through her chest. \"You,\" she whispered. \"My God, Tommy - you.\" This chapter was rewritten on 5 January 2017. The poem in this chapter is The Mermaid by William Butler Yeats. xo[Chapter 10] REWRITE THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) sometimes i just survive sometimes i stand on the rooftop of my existence arms stretched out begging for more – 10 – CHAPTER RATED M FOR EXPLICIT CONSENSUAL SEXUAL CONTENT. Tommy Conlon was a dangerous man, and Harley knew he could destroy her. Saltwater and ash, he was an oblivion she was happy to fall into, again and again. She was not made for sainthood, sin like dirt under her fingernails, damnation a dress too tight, but my god, he tasted like salvation. Each kiss he laid against her flesh burned like hellfire, fingers leaving bruises in their wake as he held her, held her like she was his, and my god, she was, she was, she was. Control was something Harley wore like war paint; each move calculated, each part of her pristine. She found pride in knowing that people only knew what she wanted them to know, saw what she wanted them to see. It was something she had been confident to utilise in this wicked dance she had found herself engaged in - and, well. Where the fuck was that control now? She had given it up, given every penny of it away the moment that Tommy had touched her and the most painful part of it was that she didn't care at all. Let him have it, let him have all of it, if only he would have her, too. Have her and have her, and have her again until the world came crashing down, sulphur and acid rain into the pit of her used soul. Oh, but she wasn't alone here. Her hands held Tommy's head, fingers knotted in his hair as he sucked her nipple, bra and dress lying discarded on the floor, his teeth grazing just enough to make her gasp his name, a prayer, a magnificat, and she revelled in the sensation of being so equally vulnerable and safe in the same moment - she knew that was him, that was everything Tommy was, and made her be. \"Tommy, please,\" she begged, and he brought his head up to snare her mouth, lips swollen from his attentions, and she moved her hands down to his bare back, drawing her nails hard across the inked skin. Tommy hissed into her mouth and kissed her harder, shifting so that his erection pressed against her hip. The friction made him dizzy and Harley huffed a strained laugh and dripped a hand past his waistband to tease him, touch featherlight against his underwear. It was Tommy's turn to moan, a short, unexpected sound at the back of his throat and Harley knew that he was as lost as she was, consuming and consumed. She laughed again, hanging on the edges of delirium, and took him in her hand, enjoying the way he bucked, muscles going taught as he held himself still above her, eyes closed. Watching his face, she gently ran her thumb over the tip before sliding her hand up his thickness to the base and back down again. Unable to hold himself aloft any longer, he buried his face into her shoulder and groaned, his teeth nipping against her skin as she laughed a little, withdrawing her hand. \"Cheater,\" he grumbled in her ear before moving down, occasionally dropping a heavy kiss against her sternum, her breast, her stomach, the hem of her panties, the last piece of clothing she had on. Leaving them on for the moment, he pressed his tongue against the patch of dampness, tasting the slight saltiness of her arousal and prompting a sharp intake of breath. Pleased he was back in control for the time being, Tommy began to gently bite at the inside of her thigh, making Harley shift and fidget, her hands laid flat against the bedsheets. He took his time, focused on each thigh for a long while before he began to slowly peel off her underwear. Harley made a low whining noise at his slowness and he shot her a dark smirk before running his nose across the small tangle of dark hair, tongue darting out to taste her folds, painfully languid. \"You're so wet,\" he teased, glancing up at her. \"Fuck, Tommy, please!\" she exclaimed, placing one hand on his head to guide him back down, and Tommy laughed at her eagerness. \"Okay, baby,\" he conceded and buried his tongue deep into her cunt. Harley cried out, throwing her head back onto his pillow as he sucked on her clit, eating her like a ripe peach. It didn't take long for the intimacy, the pleasure to take her, and when she told him in chopped gasps that she was coming, he didn't stop. He might have said something but she couldn't hear him, could only feel the vibrations in his throat as she hit a crescendo that took like her a wave, rearing up and crashing down. As she lay there, spent, Tommy lift his head, licking his lips like he had just sampled his favourite wine, his eyes as dark as the sky outside, and when he kissed her, she tasted herself. He pulled back, and Harley could only watch, rendered mute, as he shed his underwear, grabbing a condom from his nightstand and put it on, throwing the packet over his shoulder with a flourish that had her giggling. Though the last throws of her orgasm were still there, leaving her feeling tingly and malleable, she was desperate for this to happen. When Tommy positioned himself between her legs, his rough hands holding her hips steady and slightly aloft, Harley gripped the bedsheets, already feeling breathless. \"You ready, babe?\" Tommy asked, a bead of sweat running down his forehead from the sheer effort of staying still, waiting for Harley to give her go ahead. Sensing this, Harley smiled - my god, she will raze me to ground - and nodded. \"Please,\" she whispered, and it was enough. Tommy pressed into her slickness, gauged her reaction, then pushed in as far as he could go. Harley arched up with a cry and Tommy closed his eyes at the blazing heat that enveloped him, held him tight. Try as he might, he couldn't stop himself and he started to thrust, deep and hard; Harley spread her legs wide and rocked her hips to match his pace, moaning each time they met, pulsing and burning and hot. Wanting to taste her again, Tommy bent over, adjusting his hold on her hips, one arm moving to brace over her head as they rocked together, the bed banging loud against the wall with each thrust. Harley pulled his hair as Tommy bit her neck, and everything around them, between them, inside them transcended into electricity that crackled and warped, the whole universe focused inside one crappy apartment bedroom. Together they climbed and Tommy whispered hot, wet commands in her ear, come for me, come for me baby, and she did, he did, collapsing into themselves over and over until they could do but nothing but lie there, panting and slick with sweat. Neither of them spoke for a while, Tommy lying with his face pressed into Harley's neck, one arm thrown over her waist. The echoes of their cries and moans had faded, leaving a heavy silence in which echoed the drum of their heartbeats; he felt as if he had been drowning at sea, only to wash up at her feet. He thought maybe he should say something but couldn't think of the right thing to break the silence so instead he shifted to the side of her, giving her space - except Harley, eyes closed, grumbled a little and tried to tug him back to her. He shushed her and gently pulled her over to him so that she was draped across his chest. She murmured something unintelligible and tucked her face turned into the crook of his shoulder before relaxing completely, already asleep. Quite unable to help himself, Tommy smiled up at the ceiling, holding her tight. \"You're safe,\" he promised in a whisper. He could hear birds beginning to chirp outside his window, the sky already paling. Then, with Harley dreaming and the world waking, Tommy slept. It was the sunshine, not a nightmare, that woke Tommy. He stirred and tried to use his arm to block the light only to find it pinned; disorientated, he blinked through gritty eyes to peer down at the warm weight tucked against him. It was then that the events of the night before came rushing back and all he could do was stare. The sunlight did nothing to disturb Harley; no, she basked in it. Cast aflame in gold, her hair was a wild crown about the face she had turned into the light, unafraid. During the night she had thrown one arm above her head, crooked a leg at the knee, her body twisted enough that the sheets had slipped down to rest on her hips. Tommy's fingers twitched as he imagined tracing the golden lines that stitched across her bare breasts and rib cage which gently rose and fell under his gaze. He wondered if he would taste the sunlight on her skin: he wondered whether it would burn. It was as if the world had been condensed down into the space inside his bedroom, these four walls that were lit ablaze with the haze of the morning. Tommy felt caught in this inbetween state, neither asleep nor truly awake and he would think that he was dreaming but he had never dreamed like this before. There was the touch of serenity about her, the sanctity of art and he was suddenly gripped with the fear that should he touch her, his fingers would stain her flesh. His mother had raised him on tales of heroes who would fight the good fight, who would stand when all else would falter, and as a boy he would run around the yard, wielding sticks like swords, playing the hero. There was a moral to every story, a reminder to keep the faith, to carry on even when all seemed lost. A handful of deaths later and he knew better: there was no such thing as a good fight. In real life, fights always ended the same way: blood always got spilled. Tommy shook his head, ran his free hand across his eyes. He knew that was true, he knew it… except for those moments. Those moments in which he would read her his story and Harley would read back the same words but this time it would have one of those morals, like she was plucking a dying flower from his hand and placing it in water to heal. Watching her now, so still as she slept, Tommy thought of his mother. Every Sunday his Ma would enter Church and even on the greyest of days, she would find the one ray of sunlight in the whole place and in it she would pray, her shaking hands clasped around her rosary so tight her fingers would go white. Please God, she would whisper. Tommy never asked her what she was praying for, and when she stopped praying, he stopped too. In the wake of her absence, he had never sought out the sun. It seemed to have found him all the same. Before he could lose himself further in the liminal space of his thoughts, Harley stirred then, sunlight dappled in the hollow of her collarbone as she stretched out on his sheets. Tommy squinted, almost repelled by the brightness of her. He knew her tragedy and it was unsettling to know that their stories could be the same except she was the rosary, and he was the bloodied fist that clenched it.

Tommy stared at the place where his reflection used to be, tasting sand. The shock of his knees hitting the ground made his head spin and he hissed in a breath between clenched teeth. The world swayed around him and he fell forward until his forehead was pressed against the cold tile, the bite of broken glass bringing no relief from the hot fog of his dreams. \"Please,\" he whimpered, eyes screwed shut. There was blood in his mouth, grit in his eyes, quicksand sucking at his heels, and he felt like he was falling into an abyss with no one but the dead to hear him scream. Tommy wished that he could call out and hear Harley calling back. He imagined how she would run through to him, her long fingers stroking through his hair as she would pull him back from the crumbling edge. The brightness of her would bleach him clean, the sea salt of her touch would purge the rot from his wounds, anchoring him to her like the ocean floor. But she wasn't here. Harley had left to visit her mother, leaving the apartment feeling hollow. It should have been you. \"Go away,\" Tommy groaned, his hands trembling. Something was scratching in the dark corners of the room, eyes watching him from the shadows. The air was filled with the stench of charred flesh. It should have been you. The festered faces of the dead were before him, eyes sunken, watching. The wind howled, carrying voices from long ago, and then there was a great crack. Tommy threw himself down onto the sand as the earth began to open up, collapsing under the weight of war never won. He could hear Manny calling his name and Tommy tried to reach him, grabbing at his hand but his grip was slack with blood and he could only watch as his best friend was swallowed by the gaping maw of the desert. He tried to dig, clawing at the sand with his bare hands but somehow it had hardened to cool tile. His vision swam, the heat of the sun became cold and the shadows retreated. \"Please help me,\" he whispered but they were gone now; there was no one left to listen. The dream done, Tommy drifted off into an uneasy sleep that was closer to death than he deserved. It was the cold, not the sunlight, that woke Tommy the next morning. It took him a while to orientate himself, slumped as he was against the shower door. His hands ached and he stared down at them, the bruises, the bloody fingernails, and though he knew how he got them, he felt detached from the memory. Ignoring it, he got to his feet and stumbled into the shower, letting the cold sweat and old blood disappear down the drain. The morning was passed by following his usual routine - a dance Tommy had learnt the steps to a long time ago. He gulped down a black coffee shot with whiskey without tasting it before dressing in his gym gear. He couldn't stomach the idea of having to face anybody so instead he jogged around the block, over and over, as many times as it took before he lost count and the cold burn of exercise blocked out everything else. It was late afternoon when he got home, the heat in the day fading fast with the oncoming autumn. Tommy headed to the bathroom to splash some water on his face, when he saw the broken glass. It was uncomfortable recalling the night before, like prodding a wound, and so he switched off. Reverting to autopilot, he cleared away the mess, the sound of the glass hitting the bottom of the trashcan sounding very far away. Looking back on it, Tommy probably got his habit of reverting to cleaning when stressed from his Ma. Whenever she and Pop had had a bad fight, the house would always stink of bleach the next day; when she would hug him goodnight, he would be able to smell it on her like a perfume. Now, when he poured it out onto the floor in great gulps, he got flashes of her murmuring to the ceiling, fixing her apron, smiling that plastic smile she had. When the bleach stung the cuts on his hands, his broken fingernails, he imagined her holding him tight; he scrubbed harder. It was long into the night when he finished, every surface and floor scoured bitterly clean - but nothing had changed. He was just as dirty as he had been before. Some stains never come out. He didn't sleep that night. Like a coward, Tommy couldn't face the long stretch of memory that taunted him when he closed his eyes and he was scared of what demons lay waiting in the shadows. Instead he finished unpacking his things, took his time finding each thing a place of its own. Everyone always assumed his neatness had been trained into him by the Marines, but he'd always been careful about where to put things. If a single toy had been found out of place by Pop, he'd never see it again. When dawn finally came, Tommy stumbled over to the couch and threw himself down, panting like he'd just lost a fight. The apartment was so quiet. The curtains were drawn but a thin spear of morning light broke through and Tommy was mesmerised by the way the dust motes danced in it like fireflies. Beauty could be found anywhere, he thought. Just then, his phone rang. Tommy flinched, hesitating for second before he recognised the ring tone. Lurching upwards, he grabbed at the phone like it was a rope thrown to a drowning sailor. \"Hello?\" he gasped out. \"Honey, you okay?\" Oh, fuck. Her voice shot light through the darkness of him like stained glass and he felt like he was choking on it, drowning. Unable to speak for a moment, he had to lean back and close his eyes, taking a deep breath. He could hear Harley waiting on the other end. \"Yeah, babe, I'm alright.\" \"You sure?\" She sounded uncertain and for a single heartbeat Tommy was ready to let it all out, to say everything he was thinking - but she wasn't ready for it. Hell, he wasn't. So, he lied. \"I said I'm fine, babe. You good?\" \"Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry I didn't call yesterday, I got caught up with mum.\" She sounded so sad, so tired, that it reaffirmed to Tommy that he couldn't be honest with her even if he wanted to: she was already dealing with so much, he couldn't add any more weight to the mantle on her shoulders. \"Harley, it's fine. Don't worry 'bout it.\" \" I know, it's just… she's really bad at the moment and everything's up in the air with having somewhere to stay. Listen, I know I was planning on coming back to yours tonight but I think I need to stay with her, is that okay?\" Tommy's heart sunk, pictured having to lie awake for another night, finding things to stop him from falling asleep. \"Yeah, yeah,\" he ground out against the fear he felt at the things that haunted him at night, the voices and the eyes that always watched him. He couldn't be angry at Harley, he know he couldn't, but he couldn't stop the way his voice sharpened. \"Er, you sure? You don't sound like it.\" Her voice matched his and his skin prickled as if he sensed thunder in the air. \"Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. It's fine.\" \"Are you seriously pissed at me right now?\" Harley snapped, tone harsh. He could hear the temper in her voice, felt his own flare to match. \"No, I ain't pissed at you. Fuck sake, Harley, stop itchin' for a fight.\" \"You know what, Tommy? Whatever. Fucking whatever.\" There was no such thing as a dramatic hang up these days thanks to touch screens but the aggression with which Harley ended the call had Tommy dumbstruck. He went back over the conversation, imagined all the things he could have said. Baby, I had a nightmare. Baby, I'm scared. Baby, I love you. But he hadn't and he was left standing in the dark, alone again. He couldn't stand it. He'd thought having a new apartment would mean a fresh start but it was him not the house that was haunted and he'd brought his demons with him. They were with him now, creeping around corners, ghosts on the stairs. It was too much, too much, so he grabbed his bag from his room and ran to the gym, unable to slow down enough to get into the car. When he arrived at the door, he adopted a strict poker face before heading inside, shoulders stiff. \"Morning!\" Colt called from the office and Tommy nodded at him before heading to the changing rooms. The gym was quiet this early in the morning so he was able to claim the biggest punching bag in the place. He wrapped his frustration and fear around his knuckles like barbed fire, turning his weakness into a weapon the way he always did. The bag swung with each impact of his fists, the creak of the chain echoing around the hall which the other patrons tried to ignore. He was an animal, a beast , raging at the bars of his cage. Hours passed but Tommy only stopped when he heard Colt calling him from the doorway. When he turned, he saw that they were the the last ones left, dusk beginning to settle like snow on the road outside. \"Tommy, I need to talk to you about Torrent.\" It took a moment before Tommy got his meaning and he recalled the face of the man in question, his fists clenching at his sides in anticipation. This was it, this is what he needed: something to funnel his energy, his anger. \"Look, Tommy - I'm not gonna put you down for the fight. I'm sorry, man, but I don't think you're... ready for it, what with your shoulder an' all. You'd be a sitting duck in the ring.\" It was like a kick to the gut, the cherry on top of his already fucking shitty day. At first all he could do was blink at Colt, not believing what he was hearing. He was the best fighter in this dump, more than capable - and willing - to knock that Torrent punk on his ass. The only one there every damn day, he had been working hard to prove himself, but apparently it meant sweet fuck all. \"My shoulder's fine,\" he growled, interrupting whatever Colt was going to say next. The manager stopped and sighed, running his hand over his bald head, visibly uncomfortable. He didn't want to argue with Tommy but he couldn't back down on this. Any opponent would immediately target Tommy's injury and if something happened to his star fighter as a consequence, it'd be his fault. \"As your friend and as your manager, I can't let you participate in this fight until we get proper medical sign off that there is no risk. Maybe next time, okay?\" It was the sorta shit you said to a kid who didn't get picked at soccer practice and it made Tommy's skin crawl. He went to argue but Colt didn't want to be on the receiving end of Tommy's ire so he quickly spun on his heel and headed back to his office, closing the door firmly behind him. The magnitude of his dismissal was almost obscene. It was a thing of pride that kept Tommy rooted to the spot for as a long as he was, seething, silent. To leave was to admit defeat but he wouldn't beg for something he knew he wasn't going to get. So, shoulders tense and fists clenched, Tommy grabbed his stuff and left. When he got back to the apartment, the first thing he did was pour himself a whiskey. He threw it back as he stood braced against the kitchen counter, staring hard at nothing. It went down too easy so he poured himself another and another until the burn of it hitting his throat was enough to break through the haze. After his third, he wandered through to the couch, whiskey bottle in hand, and slumped against the cushions, head tilted back. His phone buzzed, startling him from the half-sleep he had fallen into, and he pulled it from his pocket. Harley's name flashed across the screen, the notification in the corner showing him that he'd already missed a number of calls. His thumb twitched as if to answer, but instead he just waited until her name disappeared. A moment later, the voicemail icon appeared and this time he let it play. \"Hi, Tommy, it's me. I'm sorry about earlier, for snapping at you, it was uncalled for. I'm just - look, are you okay? If something's happened, if you need to talk, I'm here. I'll always be here for you, Tommy.\" He waited until the echo of her voice died before throwing his phone out of sight. This chapter was rewritten on 15 May 2017.

She was sat on the floor, her back against the wall. The hospital was quiet, eerily so, and the moon stood square and bright through the single window, slanting sharp shadows throughout the room. Time felt loose here, something other, uncanny. Everything was still as if the very world was waiting, holding its breath. Exhaustion was a heavy chain around her neck but if Harley didn't stay up to guard her mum, she would slide out of bed and haunt the halls like a ghost. When the nurses had suggested using restraints, Harley had outright refused, not wanting to treat Lily like a criminal. This was her only other idea, and it seemed to work. So, she sat, she watched, and she thought. She was running out of - well, everything. Time, money, options. Lily's lucidity was becoming rarer, her tolerance to the medication meaning she had to take more of the drugs that kept her floating and confused. Her thin fingers would wind around Harley's wrist like a manacle, eyes wide and searching. Help me, she would plead. Other times, she would scream and throw things across the room, cursing her doctor, her daughter for keeping her locked up against her will. Those episodes would remind Harley of when she was a child, hiding in the closet and trying to muffle her tears as her mother went on a rampage through the house. When her father left, she thought she wouldn't feel that fear again but she'd just exchanged one type of violence for another. Seeing it again so close up after all these years was like being drenched in ice water, shaking her to the bone. Harley knew that a rotting terror that lurked in the heart of her mother's illness. The predisposition to it had been passed from mother to child, but her father's fists had only exacerbated the inherited weakness, pressing against the splinters in her psyche until they became cracks then gaping holes that consumed everything that made her who she was. During her childhood, Lily had been a good mother, her gentleness only loosely littered with her fits of paranoia or mania, but it was different now. Now, all Harley could do was take watch, a sentinel in the night, guarding her mother's dreams. She wrapped the silence around her like a cloak, the moon her solitary lantern to guide her through the murky waters ahead. It was in times like these that Harley felt overwhelmingly alone. She was the first person to preach the endeavour of carrying on, keep fighting the good fight. But sometimes, when she wasn't looking, the loneliness would strike like a cold weight in her chest. It had been two weeks since her fight with Tommy, since her anger had coiled around her like a garden snake. Looking back on it now, it was obvious from Tommy's voice that something had happened; he had sounded tired, desperate, frustrated. None of that had been directed at her but the worst parts of her had reacted before the rest of her could, and rather than being supportive or understanding, she'd gotten defensive. No wonder he hadn't taken her shit - she wouldn't have. She was normally so careful to keep her emotions under wraps, to push that unquenchable rage deep down where she couldn't touch it, but there was something about Tommy that got her back up. She knew that it wasn't anything he actively did, she knew that he would never judge her for what she was going through - but there were moments where she felt so… small compared to him. Like she was losing a race neither of them had agreed to. Three times she'd driven past his apartment, but she'd never stopped. She was in the wrong and she was being a coward about it, the fear of complete rejection making her craven. The absence of him was a physical ache. She wished she was braver, that she had apologised, because then he'd be there and she could hide in the safety of his embrace. She missed every part of him: the way he would fold around her to keep her warm, the labyrinth of ink on his skin, the scent of him, the gravel of his voice. God - she missed him so much. Fragility wasn't something she was used to, but she felt it now. It was as if she had been hollowed out, her skin just a sheet of ice ready to fracture. Her eyes burned and Harley pressed the heels of her hands against them, willing herself not cry, but the more she fought it the worse it became until suddenly she was sobbing. She tried in vain to smother the noise but it was no use, so when Lily shifted, Harley scrambled to her feet and staggered into the hallway. The enormity of her hopelessness was crushing. She didn't know what to do, where to turn - she was far from home, with no one to turn to, running out of money and still had nowhere to live. She was stuck on a visiting visa with the clock counting down and a mother who couldn't travel. It was becoming more and more obvious that her plan, which had seemed weak to begin with, was falling apart. She should never have left what she knew. Wiping her cheeks, Harley wandered down the corridor and into the visitor's lounge. She sat on a sofa that had seen better days and took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down. Crying wasn't going to solve anything and her mum needed her to be strong. \"This is bullshit,\" she thought, resting her head back to stare up at the flickering light about her head. Slowly, her tears dried and she fell into an uncomfortable half-sleep. It wasn't long after that she jerked awake, having slipped down to lie against the cushions. Her heart was pounding and her hands trembled as she sat up, rubbing her eyes. Feeling the need to move, Harley lurched to her feet and fetched herself a glass of water from the kitchenette, having to grip onto the counter to steady herself as she downed it in one. Looking at the clock, she saw that it was only three in the morning but she felt like she'd been asleep for days. She could still hear the humming from her dream but it was only now she recognised the tune: it was a lullaby her mum had sung to her as a child. In her dream it had followed her as she'd run through a field under a starless night sky, searching for something she couldn't find. As dark as pitch, she hadn't been able to see but had felt the eyes watching her, dogging her every step. Even now she still felt the cold dread of being hunted. Putting down the glass, Harley straightened up with a sigh. It was cold in the hospital, making her shiver as she slowly headed back to her mother's room, arms wrapped around herself. There was no sound except the dull moan of the fluorescent lights and the quiet beeping of a monitor from a nearby room. When she reached the door, she took a moment to gather herself before pushing it open. With her hair loose and long down her shoulders, lips pulled into an infinitesimal smile, Harley's first thought was that her mother had never looked so serene. The sheets were scarlet around her, rich like wine against the paleness of her skin, frosted by the fading moonlight. A shattered glass at the side of the bed caught Harley's eye and it was then that she saw that her mother's wrists were slashed. Shock flooded Harley with a force that had her stumbling. Glass crunched like snow underfoot as she fell to her knees at her mother side. She felt like screaming but the words wouldn't come, her fingers trembling as she gripped at the bloodied sheets. The stickiness of it made her stomach roll. Everything was blanked out, gone, except for the detached thought that there was a grace in Lily's death, somehow. The blood could have been rubies, poppies, an offering of wealth scattered around her in tribute. When she touched her mother's face, it was cold. The stillness of her was like the end of a poem, abrupt yet also complete. It took a while for Harley to rationalise long enough to press the call alarm, and the shrill voice of the nurse felt far away. Hands were on her, moving her aside, and she watched as people crowded the body, talking over her, feeling for a pulse that wasn't there until, finally, someone draped a clean blanket over her face. They wheeled her out of the room and Harley was left alone, standing with bloody hands and the echo of a life taken. The nurse who had found her first was the one to remember that she was still there. The woman gently guided her to the waiting room and pressed a cup of coffee into her crimson hands, then rubbed her shoulder. She had the good sense not to say anything as Harley stared out in front of her. She was filled with the urge to gouge her own eyes out, to scream and scream and scream until the building came crashing down, to strike out, but she was frozen in place. She was consumed with the image of her mother's moonlit corpse lying like a mermaid about to submerge herself under the ocean foam. This wasn't something she'd ever anticipated, though she realised now what a stupid mistake that was. She'd been so focused on what she was going to do with her mother's life that she had never taken the time to consider what her mother would do with it. \"Honey,\" the woman said eventually, and Harley knew what she was going to say already. She had to leave, right? There was nothing to keep her here anymore. Laughter bubbled up in her throat like vomit and she struggled to swallow it down. \"Do you have somewhere to go?\" It was only then that she realised the hospital had come to mean 'home' and even that was gone now. There was only one other place she could think of but she didn't know whether that was open to her. Either way, she had no choice so she nodded and followed the nurse to the front desk. A man she didn't recognise spoke to her about the procedure, what would happen next, but Harley missed half the words, feeling like she was falling through smoke, out of sync with the world around her. She didn't realise he'd stopped speaking until both the nurse and the man exchanged a look before staring back at her, and she got the hint. Leave. Lily had checked herself out and dead people don't have visitation rights. Her bag and coat was bundled into her arms and with one final pat on the shoulder, she was sent out the door. The moon was beginning to sink but the sky was still dark as pitch, unfeeling. Not knowing what else to do, Harley began the long walk from the hospital to Tommy's place. The roads were empty, only the flickering streetlamps there to guide her way. At one point she thought she should call him but wouldn't know what to say so she just kept walking, eyes down. Each step felt like a blade was being slid between her ribs. When she got to his front door, she hesitated for a moment before making herself knock and it was then she that saw that her hands were stained with blood. It had dried and cracked like rust, and she was still staring at them when the door opened. Sluggishly, she raised her head to meet Tommy's gaze, his expression bewildered as he took her in, blood and all. \"Baby?\" he murmured, the word heavy with concern and suddenly she was crying, arms wrapping around her middle. Tommy caught her when she started to buckle, his skin warm as he held her tight, half carrying her back into the apartment, kicking the door closed behind him. He sat her down on the couch and took her face in his hands but she couldn't stop her crying, the sobs tearing from her throat like great wounds, ripping her apart. There was a wildness in Tommy as he said her name, over and over like a prayer, and Jesus, he was fucking terrified. He'd thought he'd seen her fall apart but this was something else, something ungodly, unholy, almost grotesque in the way that she was coming undone. \"Baby, what's wrong?\" he asked. He used his thumb to wipe her tears and when Harley opened her eyes to look up at him, they were a perfect seagreen and he felt himself drowning in their depths - and then he knew; he knew this basest grief. \"I… She…\" She shuddered and stared down at her hands, seeing the blame cupped on her palms like oil. Her shoulders bent inwards like trees bowing in the wind and Tommy encased her as tight as he dared. There was gasoline in the air and it would only take one spark of the fire that was burning its way through her like a plague, and everything he had come to love would go up in flames. He pulled Harley into his lap, tucking her head beneath his chin and made the same shushing sounds he'd made to all those he'd been afraid to lose. She clutched to him so desperately her nails dug into his skin but he just held her tighter, rocking gently as her cries lasted well into the night. They were even now, Tommy thought, in this competition of loss neither of them had wanted. They were even. This chapter was rewritten on 27 May 2017.

It was bright and sunny, the birds singing through the open window in which came a cool breeze. The radio in the kitchen played an upbeat song and there were people laughing on the street below, taking advantage of the last dregs of summer. It could have been a happy day, Tommy thought, if it wasn't for Harley crying in the bedroom. He was stood outside the door, forehead pressed against the doorframe as he wondered if life really was this cruel. This was a path he'd walked long ago and to see Harley walk it now, he felt so helpless. It was a feeling he'd have thought he would have resigned himself to by now but it still burned to watch suffering and be unable to do relieve it. When he'd heard the knocking on his door, he had assumed it was either some dumb kids fuckin' about or his Pop, probably drunk. If he'd been in bed he would have ignored it but sleep didn't come easy anymore so he'd been sipping whisky in the kitchen. Fully prepared to have to scare whoever it was at the door off, he'd opened it with aggression, the words already forming when he saw Harley. There was the briefest flash of light before he had realised she was staring at her hands - hands that were stained with dried blood. After, she had said sorry so many times into his neck and mumbled something about leaving and he'd tightened his hold on her from instinct. The idea of her going back to Colt's place made him irrationally angry considering the guy was his manager, but he wouldn't understand. So he'd insisted that she stay at his apartment, luckily she hadn't protested much. Now, a few days had passed and Harley's grief was a weight she didn't know how to carry. The wound was still so raw that it was sucking the life from her, leaving her gaunt. He knew that she was trying hard to keep it together but when she wasn't crying she would stare blankly at the wall, and the sight of it, when she had been so vibrant and full of colour, made Tommy feel sick. At night he would hold her tight against him and whisper in her ear, I've got you baby, I've got you. Eventually she would fall into a fitful sleep, waking occasionally to turn in his arms, and Tommy would lie awake, sifting through memories that had been thrown up like a fistful of sand. No matter how hard he tried to dislodge them, they replayed over and over again. He saw his Ma, grey and skeletal, mouth downturned, hands clawed around an old crucifix, bald head covered in a sour scarf that had slipped down over one unseeing eye. Unlike the nightmares of his unit which flickered and flared as he relived them, his memories of his Ma were static, flat like an old television tuned into an empty channel. Somehow, that was worse. He knew that Harley felt that she had let her mother down, had failed in her duty to protect her. He knew, because he felt the same thing when his Ma had died, which was why he had signed up to the Corp: he had needed to be stronger, to fight better. It was always the same, that guilt, and it never really faded. You just learnt how to live with the taste of it at the back of your throat. He hated that Harley had to live with that now but nothing would take it away. There was a part of him, a small part he refused to voice, that was angry with Harley's mum. God knows he couldn't fault someone for feeling suicidal, especially not Lily - she'd been barely living a life, from what he'd been told - but he was pissed that she'd done this to Harley, that she'd left her daughter in that way. Harley's heart was still so soft, and she'd take the action so very personally. There had been a number of phone calls over the last few days: the hospital, the morgue, the hospital again. Harley had suffered through them with a coldness that felt familiar, answering questions delivered with the tact of a school exam. Funeral arrangements, identification checks, bill payments. \"Can't believe how much it costs you to kill yourself these days,\" she'd murmured after the last one, sliding a credit card back into her purse, and Tommy had flinched. It all felt so wrong. It had taken a week to create the world and only one night to destroy it. But maybe, if they were lucky, they might be able to scavenge enough pieces to stagger on. The day before Lily's funeral, Harley invited Tommy into the shower, resting her head on his shoulder while he held them under the water. He washed her hair with calloused hands while she traced lines in the condensation on the glass door, humming a song he didn't know. When he was done, she turned to face him with dilated pupils, her hair dark against the paleness of her neck, her breast. The water clung like diamonds to her skin and Tommy fell to his knees. He ran his tongue across her, barely touching, just enough. Harley shivered and knotted her hand in his hair, resting her head against the door when he gripped her thighs, the water hitting his back as he tasted her. The steam was thick in the small room and it was like breathing in smoke, making Harley pant as the embers were stoked within her until she came long and slow, a wave of sweet hot flame that burned away all thought for the most blissful of moments. Tommy stood and held her until her shudders stopped then kissed her with a force that had the door creaking from their weight. For a terrifying second Harley felt like she would break beneath his fingers but then she was pushing back just as hard, scratching her nails down his back with a ruthlessness that had him hissing into her mouth. She was feline and he was feral, the pair of them a storm that only grew with each lightning strike. When Tommy dipped his fingers between her thighs, licking each one with all the control of someone born into training, Harley watched him through half-lidded eyes. Grieving and glutton, she knew she should give but preferred in that moment only to take. It felt like she was drowning in guilt but Tommy forgave her sins so beautifully; he was her prayer in the dark nights. Sometimes she would wonder if they were creation or if they were destruction, but tonight she thought that maybe they were both. Afterwards, Tommy didn't take her on the floor or against the wall, but that was okay. He got to see her come undone, a blistering heat that never burned but melted away the memories like winter frost. So instead, he turned off the shower and plucked her up into his arms, carrying her through to the bedroom. He placed her down and she curled under the duvet, soaking the sheets but not caring about it. Tommy closed the curtains and climbed in after her, enjoying the feel of her being so close. It didn't take as long for her to fall asleep that night, and Tommy took that as a good sign. The funeral was less of a ceremony than a quiet pause before the body was prepared for the cremation. Tommy had thought that she would opt for a burial, but Harley had shaken her head at the assumption. Lily had always been claustrophobic, she'd told him, and would hate the idea of lying in a box underground for ever. Being cremated would allow her to be free from the confines of the prison she'd been forced to endure for the last decade. It was just the two them who attended. Colt had been mentioned but the idea of having to go through the whole politesse of explaining what had happened made tears burn behind her eyes, so she'd forgone the invite. It wasn't entirely fair to the man who'd known Lily when they kids and let her stay at his place for the past few weeks, but that was an apology for another day. For now, it was all she could do to bow her head while some holy words were read over her coffin. She could have had an open casket but Harley couldn't bear the idea of having to see her mother like that, blue and empty. She wanted to remember her full of warmth, laughing and dancing. So she had left it closed, and at the end of the ceremony she rested her hand over the wood, her chest seizing for one long painful moment before Tommy's fingers grazed her back and she found the strength to move on. The cremation was mechanical, so process driven that there was no chance of emotion to be felt amongst the burning and the smell. When Harley was handed the urn, she was surprised at how light it was. The woman who had raised her had been reduced to ash; and from earth she had come, to earth she would go. \"That is not the sum of her parts,\" Tommy said to her, voice low. It sounded like a mantra and Harley knew that he had told himself the same thing when he had buried his own mother. Their similarities were cruel and she almost wanted to laugh, but the feeling faded as quick as it came. Instead, she took Tommy's hand and held it tight as they walked back to the car, the sun shining bright overhead. The day after, Tommy left Harley asleep in their bed and headed over to his Pop's place. He still had some things to pick up and though summer still lingered, the nights would begin to get cold so he wanted to get his warmer clothes. Plus there was that blanket his Ma had knitted when he was a boy that Harley would like, he thought. He was caring more and more about what she would like, but who could blame him? He was learning the curves of her flesh like a language, collecting the syllables from the hollow of her back, her whispers left behind in rooms like red lipstick on a champagne flute, and he would gather them in his palms to read like sheet music. The cursive of her spine read like a love letter that he couldn't translate. Never one to wax romantic, these were the thoughts that he kept to himself, and where he revelled in silence, words hung from her like blossoms. When the curtains were closed, he would trace the cocaine lines of her collarbones ,and smile when she sighed, head rolling back; an ocean tide. What are you? She sat down beside him and threw him a smile the way light would refract off a diamond ring. He complimented her breakfast even though it wasn't nearly half as good as his, but it was the fact that she'd had the inclination to get up and make it that mattered. She didn't say anything but just bumped him with her shoulder as she whisked away his plate. While she was washing up, Brendan called. Resigning himself to a conversation with his brother, Tommy answered it and listened as Brendan reminded him in that kind of hopeful way he had that his birthday was right around the corner and he still wanted Tommy to come. \"You gonna bring anyone?\" Brendan asked. Tommy looked at Harley who was elbow-deep in bubbles, the pale sunlight making her hair a dark gold. It was still too soon, he thought. \"No,\" he replied. The conversation over, he threw his phone onto the kitchen table and turned his mind to better things. When Harley asked him who it was, he said no one. The rest of the day was spent tidying the apartment. Lily hadn't had a lot of belongings, most of them still back in London, but whatever she had left behind Harley packed away in a box and slid it to the back of the Tommy's cupboard. The only things she kept out were two photographs and a necklace with a small moon pendant that she didn't wear. She was very quiet that day but seemed a little more relaxed than she had been and when she sat at his feet that evening in front of the sofa, Tommy massaged the stress away, his strong hands almost sending her to sleep. \"Thank you,\" she whispered against his mouth when they took themselves to bed. She was curled up against him and her hands pressed against his chest but it wasn't lust she sought but rather the reassurance that she wasn't alone. You'll never be alone again, Tommy promised her in his mind, and she kissed him as if she'd heard him. On the ninth day, Tommy decided Harley would be okay by herself for a few hours and so took the opportunity to go back to his house and get some more of his own things; he hadn't officially moved in but he rarely left so it was safe to assume he would need some more clothes and a clean gym kit. When he assured Harley that he wouldn't be long, she assured him back that she would be just fine without him for a bit, making him grunt a little as she let out a laugh that was fresh like a rush of citrus. \"Where you been?\" was the first thing he heard as he walked through the front door of his house. He winced a little internally but kept up his stoic expression – he had pretty much forgotten about the outside world for the last week or so, had only thought enough about it to send his Pop a hurried text to say that he wouldn't be home for a while. Taking his time to reply, Tommy threw his jacket over the kitchen table and started making himself a coffee, well aware of the eyes boring into the back of his skull. He distantly thought that the house didn't smell of bleach or coffee. It didn't really smell of anything anymore. \"At Harley's,\" he finally said. He hoped that would be the end of the conversation because his temper was permanently frayed when it came to his father, a learned reflex. \"Why you spendin' so much time at that girl's place?\" Tommy felt the tension in his shoulders increase, settling like a weight between the blades, and he took a deliberate sip of his coffee, not quite feeling it when it burned the roof his mouth. \"She's my girlfriend, Pop.\" His words were strangely, overly enunciated and Paddy frowned at the tone, though Tommy didn't turn round to see it. \"You've never been this attached to some girl before.\" \"She ain't just some girl, she's…\" She's Harley. She's his. \"Well, that's great, Tommy. I'm glad you've got someone… but you're spendin' an awful lotta time with her. You haven't been home in over a week,\" Paddy pressed. Tommy shifted his shoulders, put down the coffee. He felt a snarl pull at his lips but then forced it away. This didn't need to be an argument. \"Her mom died, Pop.\" He tried not to spit it out and half-succeeded. He heard the little inhale of breath – not quite a gasp, but the sound of words falling away – and finally pivoted to look his father in his eyes which had become a screen of memory that buzzed past in the space of a heartbeat. Yes, Tommy thought, exactly. \"Oh.\" The word was dropped like a stone to the floor. \"Well, it's good of ya to help her out, Tommy, but…\" \"But, what? \" Tommy couldn't help himself, he really couldn't. \"I know what you did for your mother, Tommy… I don't want you to feel like you have to be someone else's carer.\" \"You don't know what you're talkin' about,\" Tommy ground out, barely restraining the urge to lash out. Paddy sighed, fidgeted with the hem of his old shirt. \"I just don't want to see you get hurt.\" \"Ain't that ironic,\" Tommy spat and his father flinched like he'd struck him. \"She's hurtin' and I'm helpin' her get through it 'cause that's what you do for the people you love. Not that you would know.\" \"Love, Tommy? How do you know?\" The words were soft, gentle even, but Tommy snarled, dropping his mug into the basin with such force that it cracked. \"What right do you have to lecture me on love?\" He was shaking from the rage, new and old, feeling like he was defending Harley, defending his Ma, defending his adolescent self. \"Look, son, I'm just worried 'bout you. Don't… don't confuse love for somethin' else.\" Tommy laughed and it was a horrid sound. \"You already taught me that one, Pop.\" On the way back to the apartment, he thought about the things he had lost, how whole parts of him were made up of those missing, built of empty space. Harley made him want to unbuild himself, start over, but then who would he be? Don't confuse love for something else. All he knew was that love was something to be stolen. Maybe that was what made it precious. He was terrified to find out. He was more terrified to not. This chapter was rewritten on 8 July 2017.

It was a pretty inappropriate place to put the remains of a body but she couldn't think of a better one, so there it sat. Magazines and cold cups of tea were littered around it like it was a houseplant and if she kept looking out the window, then she could pretend it was just that. The grief came at times like this, when she was doing nothing except resolutely not thinking about it. At first she had tried to avoid the sadness but then she released that when she did that, it would harden into anger and that was a heavier burden to carry. The guilt was there too, no matter what she did, but she expected that. She had spent a lot of her life feeling guilty, even when her mother had been alive. It had become a ringing sound in her ear she had grown used to, an aftertaste that was always there. There were kids down on the street below playing soccer and the sight made her smile. There was something about this city that she liked - well, something other than the obvious. She'd waited for it to become 'the place her mother had died' but there was an energy here that had yet to fade. The idea of having to leave it behind was one that was already hard to face, but it would come soon enough. She sighed, running her hand through her damp hair. Tommy had made her shower again this morning - there were definite perks involved - and though getting out of bed these days was a difficult concept, she was so grateful to have him there to keep her moving. Plus, she'd seen what succumbing to tragedy did to a person - that had been the true thief of her mother's spirit away, long before she died. She wondered where her dad was now. It been a while since they spoke which was a good thing, but it also made her feel unsettled. Should she contact him? Lily was his wife after all, they never actually got divorced in the end. When she'd been young, her mum would insist, hand on heart, that her father had been the most charming, loving man she'd ever known. What about now? She'd ask back, a child's defiance in her tone. Lily would sigh and shrug, like it cancelled itself out somehow. Harley had hated her for it, just a little. Now, here she was. Head over heels for a man she barely knew except that he was loving, even charming. Not that she would ever compare Tommy to her father - she knew his father well enough to see the lines he had drawn for himself long before she had come into his life - but then, she supposed, she wouldn't ever find out what kind of man Tommy would grow into. There wasn't long left until she would have to leave the country. Even if her ESTA wasn't running out, there was all the administration of declaring her mother deceased back home - she knew she would have to look into at some point, but didn't have the energy right now to do much else than sit and watch the sun stretch across the skyline, keeping back the autumn chill for just a while longer. Either way, she would have to leave eventually. Oh, Tommy. He'd given her so much and she wasn't sure she could ever repay him for it. This little apartment had become theirs somehow, most of her stuff here instead of at Colt's. She hadn't even see the man since before Lily had passed, Tommy valiantly offering to do the collecting and informing. For somehow who had struggled so much to open up to her at the beginning, he was currently doing most of the emotional lifting in the relationship. She knew that she was forcing him to relive old nightmares but each time she apologised for it, he would frown in that way he did, telling her that she had nothing to be sorry for. It made her fall in love with him a little more each time. \"Baby?\" Harley startled at his voice then sat up to peer over the top of the couch with a smile. Tommy was walking into the kitchen, a bag of his things in his hand. \"Hi there,\" she said, watching as he threw the stuff into the bedroom. There was tension in his shoulders but as he walked over to her, his expression was untroubled. \"You alright, baby?\" She nodded, pleased that she meant it. Tommy shot her a quick beam of a smile that she hadn't seen him use on anyone else except her and she was glad, wanting to greedily hoard it for her own; there was nothing brighter. He made them dinner and told her of his fight with his dad, though he skirted around the exact words that were spoken, and Harley knew that was for her benefit. It didn't really rile her up, understanding that their relationship was rather peculiar. They'd had one date, swapped tragedies the way normal couples would swap compliments, and after only a couple of weeks, Harley had practically moved in. Plus there was a death involved, which usually was left to at least the seventh date by her reckoning. Though, they only had three months so, she reasoned, they were just condensing it all down. It worked for them, that should be enough. \"He'll come around,\" she assured him, touching his arm briefly. \"He's just worried about you.\" \"It's a lil' late for that,\" he replied, darkly. Harley shrugged then nodded. At least he was trying, she wanted to say but decided not to. Tommy had the right to his anger. They slept easier that night, quiet. If Tommy woke to the smell of burning or if Harley woke to the smell of blood and rubies, neither of them said a word about it come the next morning. \"Hey, baby? Wanna meet my brother?\" Harley looked up from where she was folding their clothes, endeared at the sight of Tommy stood in the doorway, nervously shifting. She didn't answer straight away, thinking hard. \"Really? You want me to meet him already?\" What she meant was, at all? She had met his father by accident but Brendan lived a fair drive away so she had assumed that was a milestone in their short time together that wouldn't come to pass. The relationship between the two brothers was strained at best and though she hadn't even heard of Sparta before she met Tommy, she'd watched the clips on the internet. Watching his shoulder dislocating had made her feel sick. \"Yeah, if you wanna. It's his birthday and I said I'd go up.\" He looked about as uncomfortable as he sounded but Harley knew he wouldn't ask if her if didn't want them to go at all. He hadn't forgiven his brother for leaving him but he so desperately wanted to have a brother again. How could she say no to that? \"Sure, if you're okay with me meeting him, absolutely! When is it?\" \"Next week, I'll drive us up there.\" Harley smiled and returned to the laundry, wondering why she felt like she had just misstepped. She didn't particularly want to be introduced to any more family but it was the hard reality that she was going to have to detach herself from her grieving eventually - she couldn't stay holed up in Tommy's apartment for the rest of her time there, and making Tommy stay with her was on the verge of cruel. Yet, as the day to meet Brendan and his family drew nearer, she could feel herself getting more and more on edge. The journey up was almost awkward, something she hadn't felt between them since the beginning of their relationship. Harley kept going to break the silence but then the words would stick in her throat, and she would keep quiet, choosing instead to stare out the window. Tommy's knuckles got whiter as they neared their destination, his shoulders growing more tense which each mile. When they arrived, Harley grabbed the flowers and wine from the backseat - her idea, Tommy had looked suitably bemused at the gifts - and they walked up to the door. Just as he rang the doorbell, she threw him a quick question as a joke, expecting it to be rhetorical. \"You did tell them I'm coming, right?\" Tommy shot her a look then shrugged, and Harley's face dropped. \"Tommy!\" she whined, feeling her cheeks warm. Her discomfort increased tenfold but Tommy just shrugged again. \"It doesn't matter,\" he said, voice gruff. Harley clutched the gifts to her chest like a shield and rolled her eyes. \"Of course they will, if they wanted a family dinner they probably just expected the family to turn up!\" It was Tommy's turn to roll his eyes and he didn't respond, just turned back to the door. Harley huffed, knowing she had been dismissed, and wished she had never said yes to attending the dinner she hadn't even started. The door was opened a moment later by a man she recognised to be Brendan, Tommy's older brother. He looked slightly less haggard than the last time they'd met, Tommy thought, supposing it was because of the prize money. \"Hey, Tommy! Oh, er, who's this?\" Brendan stared at Harley who blushed and looked down, wanting to just hop back in the car and speed away. \"This is Harley, my girlfriend.\" Even to this day, the term always sounded odd coming out of his mouth and Brendan seemed to agree, taken aback as he was. \"Your girlfriend? You didn't say anything about bringing a girlfriend.\" His tone was polite, only surprised, but Harley was half ready to use the bottle in her hand to bludgeon herself to death. Tommy shifted, seeming to grow in size, and his hand came to rest on the small of her back. Immediately she calmed a little, but she still couldn't bring herself to look up yet. \"Slipped my mind.\" Brendan straightened up and smiled, realising his poor manners. He gestured for them to come in and he took their coats to hang up in the understairs cupboard. There was a delicious aroma of cooking food in the air and Harley's stomach growled, making Tommy laugh under his breath. Brendan's home was large and quite splendid, undoubtedly built for family. Photographs were on every surface boasting two grinning girls. Pairs of little pink wellies were by the front door and Harley could see a crate of toys in the next room along with a small arts and crafts station. The walls themselves seemed to radiate happiness, and it was all very beautiful. Every inch of it made Harley's skin crawl. She had never felt so out of place, surrounded by so much sunshine and warmth, that she looked over her shoulder, half expecting to see that she had left ugly, muddy footprints behind her. Tommy caught her eye and she could see that he felt the same: he looked too big for the tidy hallway. \"Please come through!\" Brendan called, grinning from ear to ear, happy to see his brother again. The couple walked into the kitchen and were introduced to Brendan's wife, Tess. She was petite and beautiful, and she held herself with a steely strength. \"Here, these are for you,\" Harley said after a moment, handing over the flowers and wine to the woman who took them with a gracious look. \"I'm sorry you weren't told I was coming, I hope I haven't put you out too much.\" The words tumbled out and she felt more than saw Tommy flash her a disapproving frown, knowing that he felt the apology unearned, but she had to ease the tension somehow. \"Oh, don't be silly!\" Tess said with a laugh, putting the gifts on the kitchen counter. \"I always make extras: Conlon boys are known for their huge appetites!\" Brendan laughed but Tommy didn't, so Tess quickly moved on. \"Please, take a seat, let's have a drink!\" \"Yes, alcohol would be lovely,\" Harley agreed, wincing a little when the husband and wife laughed but Tommy, again, stayed silent. Realising that she would have to play the social one of the two for the evening, she complimented Tess on her lovely home, how good her food smelled, how beautiful her children were. Brendan pulled his brother aside and though Harley watched them with an eagle eye, no fights broke out so she forced herself to relax and enjoy her wine. By the time they sat down for the meal, she had loosened up a bit but Tommy remained as tense as ever. His responses were short and gruff, and though everyone was pretending like that was normal, it seemed to be getting to Tess. Her questions became more and more pointed, and Harley thought that she had good intentions but was going about it all the wrong way. It was halfway through the main meal that the delicate balance started to fracture. \"So, Tommy, why didn't you tell us you had a girlfriend?\" Tess asked as she cut her lamb. \"It didn't come up,\" Tommy said stiffly, gripping his cutlery too tight. He had barely touched his food which was an alarm in itself as Harley knew he loved lamb and Tess was a pretty good cook. \"I asked you on the phone, Tom!\" Brendan contradicted with a laugh, not quite sensing the dangerous road he was embarking on. \"What, not important enough to tell me but important enough to bring to dinner?\" Harley cringed, wondering if it was possible to feel more uncomfortable than she already was. She knew Brendan didn't mean to talk about her like she wasn't in the room but Tommy took offence. \"I didn't think my relationship was any of your business,\" he ground out. Tess looked appraisingly at Harley who kept her attention squarely on her plate. \"But you've only been together a few weeks, you said.\" \"So?\" The single syllable was spat like a curse and Tess let out a heavy sigh, putting her cutlery down. Brendan eyed his wife and brother but kept quiet. \"Oh, Tommy, calm down. It was just a question, no need to have a tantrum.\" It was poor word choice, even Tess knew it, but she didn't excuse the mistake. Harley looked up now, not sure whether to jump in or stay quiet. Brendan seemed to be struggling with the same uncertainty. \"Oh, fuck off, Tess,\" Tommy said with a sneer and all hopes of getting the evening back on track quickly vanished. Brendan scowled, protective of his wife. \"Don't speak to her like that!\" Tommy just scoffed and stared down hard at the table. \"Maybe we should talk about something else,\" Harley tried, hoping to diffuse the situation but instead she got an irritated look from their hosts and she knew then that they hadn't wanted her there at all. She briefly wondered what this dinner would have been like if it had been Tommy alone. \"I'm sorry to be rude but you're not a part of this. This is between family,\" Brendan said, tone firm. Of course it was between family, Harley thought, only family could cultivate this toxic energy at a birthday dinner. \"Sorry, but I think I am a part of this,\" she disagreed, putting her hand on Tommy's thigh. \"I know you don't know me but-\" \"No, we don't know you. Maybe it's best if you leave.\" Harley was gobsmacked as she stared at Tess. She didn't know how to respond but Tommy was biting back before she could form a thought. \"You're kickin' her out now?\" \"She's not wanted here,\" Tess said tightly, not looking at her. Brendan clenched his jaw before leaning towards his brother. \"Look, Tommy. We just wanted to speak to you, as family. We don't want to have to deal with your fans at a time like this.\" \"Fan?\" Harley repeated, the word choking her, her hands grasping the side of the table with enough pressure to hurt. \"I'm not a -\" Tess put up a hand to cut her off and Harley was so mortified that she snatched her hand back from Tommy's leg and pushed her chair back, ready to tuck tail and run. \"Tommy, please, you're my brother. We just need to talk. Just you and me, as brothers. Please.\" Brendan was using the same tone that he did when he dislocated his brother's shoulder. At least, that's what Harley could remember of it. Tommy was remembering the words he was saying instead, the way he held him as they left the cage. \"Tommy,\" Harley said but Tess apparently had had enough of her presence. \"Please, just go. You shouldn't be here.\" Yeah, she could see that, could see how it was a mistake accompanying Tommy at all. She stood up and watched Tommy, expecting him to follow her but he stayed where he was, not looking at her. \"Tommy,\" she tried again but he just dropped his head. \"Right, okay.\" She got the message. Without another word she turned on her heel, collected her coat and bag, then left. The cool evening breeze hit her face on as she closed the door behind her and immediately she began to cry. Her eyes burned as she screwed them up, clenching her jaw tight while the tears fell down her cheeks. She didn't know where to go. Tommy still had the car keys and it had taken a while to get to Brendan's house, so she couldn't make her way back to the apartment. At least it wasn't raining, she thought miserably as she headed down the path and past the car. The street was quiet, very suburban, so she just picked a direction and kept walking. Her coat was thin seeing how she hadn't expecting to be out in the cold for long so she wrapped her arms around herself as she walked, sniffling a little. At the end of the road she turned to stare back at the house, trying to be understanding and not hurt that Tommy hadn't come after her. She knew that he needed to speak to his brother alone, and that Tess and Brendan hadn't meant to be rude and this was the first real time they were seeing Tommy after Sparta… but still. Taking a deep breath, she turned back and kept on walking. Eventually, just as the sun was setting, she came across a little hotel, and she could hear laughter and splashing. She dug around in her pocket and pulled out the crumpled notes she had left there from her last grocery trip and counted them wearily. Enough for a drink, she thought, eyeing the flashing neon cocktail sign. \"Evenin' honey, what can I get you?\" asked the bartender as she took a seat at the bar. The man was cleaning out a glass with a cloth and the smile he gave her seemed genuine enough. \"A glass of your sweetest wine please.\" Her sweet tooth would get her through this, she hoped. The man nodded and set down a glass of pale pink wine before heading towards another customer. Harley slid across some money and started to sip at the wine, staring into the empty space behind the bar. She had put her phone out in front of her but it never lit up, the screen stubbornly dark. Each time she thought about it, the hurt grew a little sharper but she just pursed her lips and kept drinking. \"You waitin' for someone, honey?\" the bartender eventually asked her as night came and she was still there. It wasn't a stretch to assume that she'd been stood up: she was in a pretty dress, a nice if not unsuitable for the weather coat and high heels that were already making her feet ache from the unprecedented journey to the bar. Harley shrugged. \"I suppose I am. Not sure if he's ever going to turn up though.\" She sounded down enough that the bartender leaned against on the bar, face kind. \"Well, what does he look like, honey? He might just be lost.\" Harley laughed a little, shaking her head. \"Tall, big, muscles. Tattoos everywhere you look. Looks like he's going to punch you but he's actually a big softie. He's called Tommy, if he… if he turns up.\" The bartender smiled affectionately and straightened up. \"Sure thing, honey. If I see him, I'll let you know.\" Harley tried to smile but it was more of a grimace but the man didn't seem to notice as he started talking to another customer. After another glass of wine, Harley decided she'd had enough of sitting and headed out into the garden. There was no around, it too cold for anyone else to venture out by the pool, but Harley appreciated the solitude. The air was crisp, bringing her out of her sullen stupor, and she started laughing at herself. Here she was, moping around because Tommy dared to spend time with his family without her. Really, she should have guessed that was Brendan's intention in the first place and showing up unannounced was of course going to cause some tension, and she knew that Tess hadn't meant to offend, that she was trying to get Tommy to engage with them. She knew that, she did. It still hurt like a bitch, though. Her feet traced the edge of the pool as she gazed up at the stars, bright against the black cloak of the sky. She thought of Tommy, the darkness he held within him, the secrets he wouldn't tell. She wondered what kind of life he would have had if you took the death away. He'd experienced more tragedy and suffering than she had thought possible and he had somehow come out at the other end still willing to throw himself in front of the bullet, still so full of compassion and endless patience. Who else would have cared for her the way he did after her mother's death? There were friends back home in London but she couldn't comprehend any of them being able to understand her the way he did then. He held onto life the way a child would catch butterflies, those he had lost strung up like fairy lights in the cathedral of his soul and they shone so bright. Tommy thought he had lost all of his fights but he didn't see that he was fighting one each day and my god, Harley thought, he was winning. Who else, she asked. Who else? Shaking her head, she took another step but there was nothing for her foot to land on. By the time she realised she was falling, the thought was swallowed by a flash of hot pain in her temple and then a flood of water that rushed down her throat. She tried to breathe, choked and then - nothing. This chapter was rewritten on 9 July 2017.

He wanted to get up, he wanted to chase after her but he owed it to himself to hear what Brendan had to say. All his life he had prayed that he would get his brother back, no matter how angry he was with him. When Brendan had told him he wasn't coming with Tommy and their Ma, it had hurt more than any belt from Paddy ever could. When he had stood over his mother's dead body, the absence of his brother nearly overcame the grief of losing her. He had felt like he'd lost his entire family in one go, and it was a pain that had coloured every part of his life after that. Now he had a chance to fix it - or at least get some closure. Their fight at Sparta had been so emotionally charged that coming out the other side was draining enough without rehashing everything else, but so much time had passed now and their empty promises of family and never again were fading fast. There was a quiet desperation in the lines of Brendan's face that had Tommy remaining in his seat, even though it physically hurt to let Harley walk away. He hadn't even been able to look at her, knowing that if he had seen the look in her eye, he would have left the house in a second. But he had to do this. \"Thank you, Tommy,\" Brendan murmured, eyes intense. Tommy just shook his head, feeling like there was gravel beneath his skin. \"Don't. Just - don't. What dya want to say?\" Brendan swallowed then looked at his wife who sighed and stood up. She picked up the plates of half eaten food and went to walk into the kitchen before pausing and turning to look at her brother in law. \"I'm sorry if I came off harsh. I know you've not got a lotta love for me, but I really do see you as part of this family. Just give us a chance.\" Having said her piece, she turned and closed the door behind her, not waiting to hear Tommy's response which was just as well as he couldn't fathom one. Tess had always been the one to steal his brother away, and he hated the idea of her. Yet he knew nothing about her as a person except that she was always there - but hell, if that was her only crime, she was better than most people. It was just the two of them now and it was the least violent setting they'd been in for over a decade which was saying a lot. Brendan looked pained, thoughts racing. He'd always been the smart one, Tommy thought, whereas he'd been the fighter. Still lost though. \"Tommy, I'm glad you stayed. I've been wantin' to talk to you ever since… well, for a while. I made you a promise that I'd be there for you now but I haven't seen you for so long. I don't want us to drift apart again, not after everything we went through.\" Jesus, did Tommy hate talking about this emotional shit. He found it hard to put what he was feeling into words and after years of being taught by every authority figure in his life, including himself, to keep all that shit inside, being invited to put it all out onto the table now felt like hacking open a wound long scarred over. \"I don't want that either,\" he finally got out, jaw clenched so tightly it ached. It got easier after that though, Brendan leading the conversation which really was quite short. It was founded on a lifetime of guilt, Tommy knew that, but he also knew that Brendan needed to act upon that guilt. It was only fair to give him a chance to make things better when it all had stemmed from the decision to stay with the woman he loved. Tommy wondered for the first time what he would have done in his brother's position if he was forced to make that decision now. His brother or Harley? Which was when he realised that it had gotten dark outside and though he had assumed at the time that Harley would have just waited for him in the car, it struck him now that the car keys were still in his pocket. \"I need to go,\" he declared, coming to a stand as he said so. Brendan, who had been about to breach the sore topic of their childhood looked a bit crestfallen before too realising the time. He came to a stand and Tess appeared behind them - had she been listening the whole time? - with his coat in her hand. He tried to take it from her with as little aggression as possible, knowing that really, she didn't deserve it. Her words to Harley had been unnecessarily abrupt but she had been looking out for her husband, his brother. At the door, Brendan pulled him in for a hug that Tommy only resisted for half a second. It felt good to have his brother in his arms again but he also knew that a hug and a conversation wasn't going to heal all that time lost. Still, perhaps they were one step closer to getting there than they had been before. The door closed behind him and the first thing he saw was that Harley was not there waiting for him. It wasn't the night air that made him go cold as he did a sweep of the area, his mind cataloging all the possible ways she could have gone. He was, of course, resolutely assuming she had decided of her own free will to walk away and hadn't been taken. It was too early for that kind of fear. Diving into the car, he pulled out his phone that he had left in the glove compartment and checked to see if he had any messages. None. He quickly dialled her number but it just rang out each time he tried. Next he checked her social media accounts hoping she had checked in somewhere but there was nothing - except, there! She had left a comment on a picture, tagging a person he didn't know, saying me right now with a symbol of a wine glass. That had been only twenty minutes ago. He almost laughed - trust Harley to leave him a trail of emojis to find her. It was the modern day manhunt. The nearest bar was at the hotel on the corner a couple of streets away. He hoped that good fortune would shine down on him and he would find her there, waiting with a glass of that sweet shit she liked to drink, cursing his name. Nothing would make him happier right in that moment. It didn't take long to arrive and he headed straight towards the bar, eyes scanning constantly for a sign of her. The bartender saw him coming and looked him up and down in a way as if he knew him. \"Can I help you, sir?\" the man asked as he approached. \"Have you seen a young woman here, dark hair, red dress, green eyes? Probably drinking pink wine or somethin' sweet.\" He hoped he didn't sound like some creep leering over a girl by herself because that's exactly what he would assume if he was on the other end of this but the bartender just sent him a big smile. \"Let me guess, Tommy?\" \"Er, yeah?\" \"I was asked by a young lady in a red dress to keep an eye out for a guy called Tommy, and I have to say you match the description.\" Tommy couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief as the man pointed towards some French doors at the back of the room that led out into the garden. \"She went that way that not long ago. She's been waiting for you.\" Tommy winced a little but the man just smiled and walked away. Tommy hurried out into the garden, his apology already on his tongue as he looked around, almost excited to see her. Except, he couldn't. It wasn't a large area and it was very still, only the sound of crickets disturbing the silence. \"Harley?\" he called, walking around the picnic benches and sun loungers, squinting through the darkness but he couldn't see anything. \"Harley, baby?\" As he got nearer the pool he could hear the water slap against the side and he glanced over. A dark shape caught his eye and looked harder. There was something on the surface of the water, unmoving, and as he got closer he saw the red of a dress and dark hair - \"Harley!\" Tommy dove into the water, sending it rearing up onto the stone tiles but he didn't even notice, too focused on pulling his girlfriend out of the water. He quickly turned her over so that her face was out the water and the sight of blood on her forehead made his heart clench like a fist inside his chest. Cursing, he waded back to the edge and laid her there, clambering up after her as fast as he could. As he turned her head to the side and checked for a pulse - yes, there! - he could taste the onset of panic but instead he listened to his training and started applying CPR, counting each mouth-to-mouth and chest compression in his head. \"Come on, baby!\" he begged as he took a breath, before beginning again. The third time around, Harley suddenly convulsed, choking on water. Tommy guided her head to the side, allowing her to vomit it up. He rubbed her back, trying to see if there was any blood in the water she was coughing up. When she collapsed back down, he pulled her gently into his arms. \"I've called an ambulance!\" said someone from the other side of the pool. It was the bartender who was clutching a phone in his hand, his face pale as he stared across at Harley in shock, a crowd of guests huddled by the entranceway. Nodding his thanks, Tommy held Harley until the paramedics came. They were kind but focused, asking him questions as they strapped an oxygen mask to her face after checking her airway, then lifted her onto a stretcher and wheeled her through the bar. He hopped in the ambulance beside her and held her hand as they sped towards the hospital. Harley's eyes flashed open a few times but when he said her name, she didn't respond. Her breathing was laboured so the paramedic next to him inserted a tube down her windpipe, saying words like hypoxemia and endotracheal intubation, but they just flew over his head. He knew that it was still serious, that she wasn't in the clear yet, but she was alive so he just focused on that instead. The waiting was the hardest part. Not being able to see her. A doctor came to talk to him after the first hour with an update, telling him that they had done a CT scan to see the extent of her head wound, and that they had her on a ventilator to support her breathing. \"We're going to have to keep her for observation so we can monitor her blood oxygen levels and any onset of ARDS, or any other complications from the near-drowning. The damage so far doesn't seem to be too extensive so it was good that you found her when you did. I'll let you know what the results of the scan show, and if anything else arises. If you have any questions, please ask one of the nurses who will find me.\" It was hard for Tommy to not assume the worst. He was a learned pessimist: the people he loved didn't walk away from things like this. But he couldn't think like that or the panic would set in so he held himself like a Marine and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally, they let him see her. She was still unconscious so he sat at her side and took her hand. It was warmer than it had been the last time he held her and he spied the extra blankets that had been tucked around her, but she was still so pale. Her hair had dried in a wild curly mess which a nurse had kindly brushed back against the pillow. He suddenly remembered Harley saying how senere her mother had looked, lying dead, and a wave of terror threatened to choke him. \"Please, baby, you gotta wake up, you gotta be okay. Don't leave me like this, please, I can't - I can't lose you, too. I love you, baby, I really fuckin' do. I'll give you the world, the whole world, whatever you want, if you just wake up.\" The nurses asked him to leave after that, saying they needed to do some more tests to make sure there wasn't any swelling on her brain. Tommy left, feeling like a ghost chained to a graveyard. It wasn't until a couple hours later that the doctor came to find him, a gentle smile on her tired face. She touched his shoulder to wake him from the light doze he had fallen into and he snapped up, automatically scanning the room for a threat, heart racing. The doctor stepped back to give him his space and he cleared his throat, his mouth full of sawdust. \"How is she?\" he asked and she just nodded towards the room. He followed her soundlessly, fearing the worst, but then he saw her sat up, piled high with blankets and her hair pulled back into a ponytail. \"Harley!\" He darted over to her side, his hand coming up to gently brush her face, relief cascading through him like a fire. She smiled up at him a little nervously but mostly pleased and she leaned into his palm, feeling safe now that he was here. \"Hi,\" she croaked, and the doctor immediately scolded her, saying she would need to rest her voice for a few days. Her throat and lungs had been through a lot and there was still a chance that damage could set in, she said, but that for the moment it was looking good. \"Thank God,\" Tommy whispered and kissed Harley on the temple, thanking whoever or whatever would listen that his prayers had, for once, been answered. Harley giggled a little and kissed his cheek before leaning back against her pillows, looking exhausted. The doctor - Doctor Andrews, Tommy remembered - started telling them of the things they should be looking out for in case any symptoms started to manifest. Tommy made a list in his mind of every single one, and questioned the doctor on what he could do to help. Harley smirked but he was too intent on listening to notice. They kept her in for another few hours before releasing her early afternoon the next day. The nurses bid them farewell as they left, and once at the door, Tommy scooped Harley up into his arms and carried her to the car - he had collected it just shortly before she was released so they wouldn't have to do the long walk back to Brendan's. Once he was sure she was comfortable, they headed back to the apartment. \"I'm sorry,\" Harley whispered as they pulled onto the highway. She sounded so small that Tommy glanced at her, surprised. \"Baby, I'm sorry. I should have gone after you.\" Harley looked down, still feeling the hurt but knowing why it had happened that way. \"Tommy's, it's okay. You found me, you saved my life.\" She rested her hand on his thigh and he quickly covered it with his own. \"If I had come after you sooner…\" \"Don't do that to yourself, baby. You found me. I'm okay, I'm going to be okay. Anyway, I knew you needed to have that talk with your brother, you needed to stay. I should have told you where I was or stayed by the car, or… but that doesn't matter now. I'm okay. You found me, and we're okay.\" Tommy felt the need to argue but then he saw Harley's determined expression and instead he laughed, pulling her hand up to his lips. \"Yeah, baby, we're okay.\" This chapter was rewritten on 8 July 2017. The quote is from the poem Scheherazade by Richard Siken. You may notice I use a lot of his quotes because everything he writes is gold. xo[Chapter 16] REWRITE THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake and dress them in warm clothes again how it was late and no one could sleep – 16 – The bed rocked as Tommy began to twist and thrash in his sleep as if he was being electrocuted, startling Harley awake. She was disorientated for a second but then Tommy jerked again, letting out a whimper, and she sat up, alarmed. \"Tommy?\" she whispered, reaching out to touch his shoulder, his skin damp with cold sweat, but the moment her fingers brushed against him, he flinched and threw out his arm like he was fending off an attack. Harley had to throw herself backwards to avoid getting an elbow to the face and her eyes were wide as saw at the way his muscles strained like a bowstring pulled too tight, his eyes racing behind closed lids. \"Please!\" he cried out, panting hard. \"Baby, it's okay, it's just nightmare, you're okay,\" she tried to soothe but her words couldn't reach him through the sand dunes of a world far from here. There were ghosts in her memory too but none of them had the power she saw here - the terror his incited had sunk talons deep into this man she loved and she didn't know how to free him from it. She'd thought that she'd seen his nightmares but this was something else, something unholy. This wasn't a dark dream but a memory relived, torturing him right before her eyes. The sheets were tangled around his legs and when he tried to kick himself free but couldn't, he cried out in panic. \"No, please, no!\" he begged but what was he begging for? She was afraid to find out. \"Tommy,\" she said again, knowing it was useless. She wanted to cry but knew that wouldn't help so she blinked away the tears and got to her knees on the bed, trying to think how to calm him down without receiving a black eye in the process. She could call for help… but who would come? His brother, his father? For all she knew, they were the villains in his nightmare. How did it get this bad? Well, what a stupid question. Like Tommy would ever want to share this side of him to anyone, even a stranger, she thought. He needed help though, that much was obvious. Oh, why did he never tell her? She wondered whether seeing her in a hospital bed that had triggered such a violent episode, wished that he had said something, anything! Under her gaze, Tommy suddenly went crashing to the floor, pulling the bedsheets with him. Cursing, Harley scrambled after him to see him lying on his side, very still. \"Tommy? Tommy!\" Fearing that he'd hurt himself on the fall, she went to his side and rested her hand on his hip, praying that he could hear her now. Under her touch he started to shiver as the nightmare began to fade. \"Please, baby, you need to wake up,\" she said, trying to keep her tone calm despite how badly her hands were trembling. His eyes opened and she sighed in relief, her hand moving up to brush through his hair like how she would do when they were lying on the sofa in the fading sunlight, with her reading and him just dozing. \"H-Harley?\" His voice was strained from his yelling, and he raised his head a little. \"Yeah, baby, I'm here. You're okay, I'm here.\" His head dropped again into the crook of his arm and his shoulders began to shake. Harley, tears silently dripping down her cheeks, began to hum an old lullaby her mum had sung to her as a child. She couldn't remember the words but the tune was a peaceful one, and for a long while Tommy remained on the floor while she sang, her fingers gentle against his scalp. Eventually Tommy got to his feet, not looking at Harley as he did so. She moved back to give him his space, knowing that uncomfortable he must be feeling having her see this part of him, this terrible secret. He swayed as he stood, casting a look she couldn't see at their dishevelled bed. Then, without a word, he disappeared into the kitchen. Harley wasn't sure whether to follow: she knew that Tommy preferred solitude in these moments but she also remembered how she'd felt when he hadn't come after her and decided that this time he needed someone to be there. When she walked through she saw him hunched over the counter, an already empty whiskey glass in his hand. Ignoring her doubts, she stood behind him and without hesitation wrapped her arms around his chest, resting her cheek against his back. She felt him tense under her touch and she thought he would push her off but then he relaxed and turned in her grip so that he could pull her to him. He tucked her head beneath his chin and held so tight it stole her breath away but she didn't move. She was engulfed by the heat of him and knew that her fear had been only for him, never for herself. \"I love you,\" she told him, her words fierce like she expected him to argue. \"I know,\" he replied, and it felt like a staggering leap of progress. She wanted to say that he could tell her if he wanted to but he seemed to hear the words before she spoke and he huffed a laugh. \"I know,\" he said again, and then he started to tell her. She stayed where she was, wrapped around him as close as she could while he began to unlock all the darkest parts of himself, those secrets she thought she'd never see. He told her the story of Manny and his unit, how he had been in the middle of their massacre, the only one to walk away. How he had been flown out and then released with nowhere to go, so had crawled back to his Pop's, stinking of booze and hate. He told her of Sparta, the casino, the hotel room with Moby Dick, the fight with his brother in the cage. She walked with him all the way up to the day she had arrived at Colt's gym, oblivious to the journey he had been forced to travel and everything he'd lost along the way. It took a long time and the sun was beginning to rise by the time he was done, but they stayed where they were, entangled, until the very end. Harley became a safety net that refused to break beneath the weight of Tommy's grief. She would take it all if she could, every thought of sadness and anger, she would draw it from him like poison from a wound and consume it until he could sleep easy again. But it wasn't that simple, no matter how much she loved him. All she could was be there, listen, love him - and she would do just that. \"Don't leave,\" he whispered into her hair after a stretch of silence. Harley squeezed him even tighter and screamed a prayer in her head, damning herself and the world for the unfairness of it all. \"I won't,\" she promised, not knowing how she could ever keep it. It took a few days for Tommy to stop hovering around Harley every minute of the the day, waiting for her to pass out or develop some horrible illness. So dedicated was he to the task of monitoring the potential onset of any complications from her near-death experience, that he took all of Harley's progressively ruder protests on the chin until finally he could reassure himself that she was okay. Her lungs hadn't sustained any long-lasting damage and the doctor at their local hospital was happy with her blood oxygen levels. The only visible reminder of the incident was the stitches that were to be removed at the weekend. Tommy could barely believe it but she was okay. She was still here. \"So, can I go buy some more bread by myself or do I need a bodyguard?\" Harley asked him, already prepared to make a run for it in case he gave her the wrong answer. Tommy just grinned before shooing her away, acting disinterested when she gave her sarcastic thanks. Turning away, he went back to fixing himself a protein shake, waiting for the sound of the door to close when instead he heard Harley swear in alarm. He moved on instinct, appearing at her side before she had the chance to call his name but he relaxed when he saw who was there. \"Brendan - what're you doin' here?\" Brother stared at brother; they'd come so far but there was still so many years lost in the gulf between them. \"I came here to apologise,\" he said, turning to look at Harley who felt pinned in place by those pale blue eyes, a cold shade in a warm face. Surprised by the turn of events, Harley gathered her composure and stepped aside to grant Brendan enough space to come in. Not that it was really her place to do so seeing how it was Tommy's apartment but he didn't seem to mind. They all headed to the sitting room and watching them then, Harley could see how their differences: Tommy was the broader one, his body lined with thick ropes of muscle, all force and brute strength like a sea storm, whereas Brendan was tall and lean, weathered by a mostly happy life, the ocean in him calm yet bracing. Yet brothers there no doubt were, cut from the same cloth, carrying the same heart, the same knuckles. \"Sorry to just drop in on you like this but I was in the area and…\" Brendan trailed off before catching Harley's gaze with a familiar intensity. \"Harley, I offer you my sincerest apologies on behalf of me and my wife. We handled the situation at the dinner horrendously and our manners were appalling.\" He sounded so sincere that Harley couldn't even take a moment to pretend to think about her answer. \"Please, there is nothing for you to apologise for,\" she insisted, unconsciously wringing her hands. She really did hate being put on the spot and she still felt a little embarrassed at being told to leave, but she'd had this conversation with herself a hundred times already. Wrong method, perhaps. Right intentions, definitely. \"You needed to speak to Tommy alone, that's perfectly understandable. Honestly, no harm came of it.\" Tommy shifted, his face drawn and Harley mentally pleaded with him not to say it but he did anyway. \"Some harm came of it,\" he muttered, watching her, and she sent him an irritated look. Brendan caught the exchange and was confused. \"What do you mean?\" Harley went to give him some fluffy bullshit answer but Tommy got there first and she wanted to strangle him. \"She got rushed to hospital that night,\" he said and Harley groaned out loud. What a great way to paraphrase, she thought to herself, and hurried to explain. \"I waited for Tommy at a nearby hotel and I went into the gardens. I accidently slipped and fell into the pool but Tommy found me and I'm fine,\" she stressed, more for Tommy's benefit than Brendan who was still looking a bit wide-eyed. \"I am sorry,\" he insisted and Harley sighed. \"Yeah, I know. It's okay. Look, why don't I leave you two to it? I gotta go to the shops anyway.\" She reached up to give Tommy a kiss on the cheek and Brendan expected him to be embarrassed but he just held the woman to him for a moment before letting her go. \"Be careful,\" he called after her. \"I am always am!\" she trilled back, rolling her eyes as she pulled the door closed behind her. \"You never are,\" Tommy said to himself before looking back to Brendan who was smiling a little. \"What?\" \"Nothin' man, you just look… happy. You and the guy I met on the beach - it's like you're a different person.\" Tommy shrugged but knew he was right. He could remember how he had felt standing on that beach with the cold sea air not enough to cool the rage in his belly as Brendan showed him pictures of his daughters. How he had loathed those two girls, the jealousy he had felt over children was shameful now but seeing his brother, the one person he had looked up to as a kid, brandish his new family had hurt him. It was like Brendan had upgraded, left all the bad shit behind, including him. But things were different now. He had a job, he had a place of his own, he had a girlfriend who he actually trusted enough to tell his shit to. That woman had seen the worst of his nightmares and had still been there in the morning, holding him just as tight and fuck, that wasn't something even he was dumb enough to throw away. He was able to think about this shit now, not just feel it; he could look past the hurt of a child. He used to spend hours imagining what would have happened if Brendan had left with him and Ma, how all the bad stuff would have turned into good stuff, somehow, and things would have been alright. But he knew enough of life now to know that's not how it worked. Ma would still have been ill, would still have died. He probably still would have joined the Marines - hell, Brendan might have joined too, and what if something had happened to him? Or, without Brendan there to dissuade him, what if Paddy had chased them down - that would have been a reunion he's not sure they would have lived through. Then, without the wonder of Brendan's two beautiful daughters to guide him, would Paddy have ever turned to sobriety? No, the bad stuff wouldn't have turned into good stuff, just worse stuff. Brendan was happy and now so was Tommy - and maybe it was all because his brother had chosen to stay. \"Thanks, man,\" he said after a while. \"Thanks for comin' over. It means a lot to me… and Harley.\" Brendan smile, pleased at the way his impromptu trip was going, and walked over to pull his brother into a hug. This time Tommy held him just as tight, the two of them slapping each other on the backs before pulling away. It was weird but they felt… lighter, somehow. \"I love you, man,\" Brendan said, grinning. Tommy laughed at his dumb expression, just like when they were kids. \"I love you too.\" There, he said it. He could say this shit, he could. \"And I'm glad you two are together. Tess says to tell you that she's sorry she comes across as such a bitch sometimes, she can't help it. She's happy for you both.\" They both laughed at that and headed back towards the door. \"Anyway, I'm hoping we can try the dinner again sometime. Harley is invited, of course, and I promise no one will get told to leave.\" \"Sounds good, just let me know.\" They bade farewell and as Tommy watched him leave, he couldn't believe how damn civil they'd been. It felt good to know that he had his brother back, even after all these years. By the time Harley gotten back, he'd finished his protein shake and was watching the news. She quickly put away her purchases before coming to sit next to him, pulling his arm around her shoulder so she could rest against his chest. He kissed her crown, enjoying the feel of her so close. \"How did it go?\" \"Good, yeah.\" Harley seemed almost surprised and he laughed. \"Yeah, I know, but it was. He said Tess says sorry to you, by the way.\" \"So she should! Like I'm just some fan,\" she snorted, sitting up straight. Tommy feigned hurt and surprise, making her giggle at his expression. \"What, you're not my fan? Get out,\" he ordered, leaning over so that she had to lie flat against the sofa. He kissed her neck as she snickered, her hands in his hair. \"Maybe you should persuade me?\" she asked, her breathing hitched as he gently bit the flesh of her breast. \"Mmm, maybe I should,\" and he already had something in mind. Wrapping her legs around his waist, he stood up and went to the bedroom, kicking the door closed behind him. This chapter was rewritten on 10 July 2017. The quote is from the same poem as last chapter, Scheherazade by Richard Siken. xo[Chapter 17] REWRITE THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) there is an end to you don't fear it, don't wallow; flowers wilt, rivers dry up even the stars extinguish themselves have your time and then let it go – 17 – Where did the time go? Days had turned into weeks which turned into months and now here she was at the end of the line. The piece of paper which allowed her to remain in Pittsburgh was lying crumpled in front of her and soon it would be void. She wanted to rip the damn thing to shreds but that would solve nothing. The flight was already booked, had been since before they'd arrived. When she'd reached the city with her mum in tow, she had immediately started counting down the days until she could go back home. The whole trip had been exhausting and she had missed her own city terribly, especially when she would leave her mother at the hospital, returning to lie awake on Colt's couch until it was time to get up again. Her entire life had been rooted in London with the lights, the people, the attitude. When she had left it all behind she had assured herself and her friends that it was only temporary - but now she wished she didn't ever have to go back. By falling in love with Tommy, she had fallen in love with his city as well. London had always been home to her, no matter what befell her, but now she wasn't so sure. So much would be missing with no way to get it back. Not that it mattered what she wanted. She had to leave whether she wanted to or not, and she had to leave today. They hadn't spoken about it really but Tommy knew this was coming, three months is not long enough to forget where the finish line resides. What was she going to do? This was it, she would have to wait another ninety days before getting a new ESTA and then, what? She would alternate between three months here, three months there? She wasn't sure she had the energy for that life and she certainly didn't have the money. Tommy would say he would go with her, she knew it. It hadn't been long but she knew in her heart that he would follow her if she wanted him to, and she did, she did but… could she put the burden on him to constantly travel back and forth? He had so much potential in his life now: him and Brendan were becoming brothers again, his shoulder was healed enough that Colt was booking him in for fights, his dad was here and she knew he would want to keep an eye on Paddy, no matter how much they argued. After everything he had been through, he was finally regaining a life here in Pittsburgh so how could she ask him to give it all up and follow her across the world just for a chance of what if? Then came the thought that she had desperately tried to ignore but couldn't any longer: who would they be in that type of relationship? From the beginning, they had resigned themselves to three months, condensing all their madness and tragedy into a handful of weeks because they knew that their time had been running out from the get go. There was always an end in sight and that had formed the foundation of who they were together. What if they took that intensity and dragged it out with constant flights, traveling, moving around - would it twist into boredom, even resentment? What if Tommy realised that his love for Harley was just… gratitude? Lust? Maybe even the excitement of it all? She wouldn't survive watching him walk away from her, it would be too painful. No, she couldn't do that to him, to them. It was enough, they were done. By the time Tommy arrived home, her bags were packed and sat on the bed, her passport sticking out the side pocket. She stared down at them as he greeted her from the hallway, dropping his gym kit and shoes at the front door. Her throat was too tight to speak so he came searching for her when he didn't get a reply and she could feel his gaze as he took in the sight before him. \"You're goin'?\" he asked, voice low. It wasn't something he could argue with and he knew that this day would come, but it still made something inside him lurch seeing her stood with all her things packed, the wardrobe empty, the little touches that made this place their's and not his gone. \"Yeah,\" she said finally, her throat dry. \"I'm going.\" When she turned to face him, she was ashen, eyes downcast. Tommy frowned and went over to take her hands, holding them tightly in his own. \"I'll come with you,\" he said without hesitation. He hadn't expected Harley to just pack up without them talking about it first but nevertheless, he had known that he would follow her the moment she had opened her eyes in that hospital bed. He smiled a little, trying to get her to do the same, but when she finally met his eyes, he didn't like what he saw. \"No, Tommy. You won't.\" \"What dya mean? Of course I will,\" he argued, feeling like he was missing something. \"Tommy, I…\" She looked pained and he cast his gaze up and down her, taking in the whole of her. He didn't understand why she was acting so odd; this wasn't the end. \"You can't come with me.\" \"Then I'll get the next flight,\" he said slowly, really hating where it felt like this was leading. \"No, I mean - you can't come with me… at all.\" The moment she said the words, he knew that of course that was what she meant. She was leaving and she didn't want him to come with her. He let go of her hands which clenched into fists at her sides. \"What?\" Harley flinched from the staccato of his tone and took a step back, already trying to put as much distance between them as possible. \"I'm sorry, Tommy, but I can't… fuck, I can't do this.\" She meant the conversation but he thought she meant their entire relationship and as that thought set like the sun on his face, she knew she couldn't correct him. It would be easier for him to let her go if he thought that was what she wanted. It's not, Tommy, I promise you it's not! Tommy almost felt like he wanted to laugh. How else was this going to end? Did he really think that Harley in all her glory would give up her entire life for him? She was destined for greatness, it was written in every line of her body, and that was something he couldn't give her. He would love her, he would love her with every fibre of his being, but he couldn't give her the life she deserved. Instead he would drown in the ocean of her absence, a burning shipwreck left stranded on her waves tempestuous. When she had first crashed into his life, he had been too eager to slake his thirst from her depths and in his madness has forgotten that saltwater never gave, it only took. But God, he would let her take it all. \"I'm sorry,\" she whispered but Tommy turned away, unable to even look at her. He understood but he still hated her for it. He had started to believe that maybe she was different, that she was untouched by the plague that had swept through his life but here she was, becoming yet another name on a list. Everyone left in the end. Everyone. She still had some time before she had to leave but Harley couldn't stomach seeing Tommy so defeated, so angry for any longer than she had to. Without a word, she picked up her bags and made her way towards the door. At the last moment she turned to look back but he was still in their... his bedroom. It was what she knew was best for him but it didn't stop her heart from breaking as she closed the door and made her way down to her car. Tommy watched from the window as she loaded her bags in the back, cast one last look up at the apartment and drove off. He felt something inside him pull away with her and the pain nearly sent him to his knees. She was gone. For a long while, he stayed rooted to the spot, afraid that the world around him would shatter if he made a step, but then the pain turned to anger. He stormed through to the kitchen with the intent of pouring a whiskey but there was none left, the last of it used in the aftermath of his latest nightmare. He remembered how she had held him and he had started to believe that maybe it was all real, maybe she would be the one to break the curse - but that was too much pressure to put on a person. The apartment was too quiet without her. He had always been able to hear her humming or singing to herself, making dinner or reading a book. Now there was just an echoing emptiness and he didn't know how to fix it. He couldn't stop her from leaving and she didn't want him to follow. She deserved to have a fresh start, to move on from the death of her mother, see her friends and begin again. He sat at the table with an empty bottle of whiskey instead an empty apartment. They weren't the same four walls he had always known yet somehow the space between had never changed. It never would. This chapter was rewritten on 11 July 2017.

Not for the first time that day, Tommy had to restrain himself from knocking his manager out cold. Adrenaline had flooded his system and he could smell the blood on his knuckles. \"You've found your fire again, Tom! Back to the beast I saw in the ring on the fated first day,\" Colt chuckled, looking happier than he had done in months. He always got like that when he predicted the money coming in. Tommy just grunted and pulled away, heading to the shower stalls without another word. He washed quickly and threw his clothes back on like he was being timed. If he stayed still for too long, he would start to think and then he would start to drink. Going back to his old life had been hard to say the least, so he had thrown himself into the one thing he knew would get him through it: rage. Fights had been few and far between what with his shoulder and Harley had been around but now he was doing as many as he could, stacking them up back to back. The cash was flowing in but more than that, he didn't have to think about anything other than his fists. When he wasn't training, he was performing, the sound of a full audience chanting drowning out her voice that he kept waiting to hear. But, despite all that, he still had to return to the empty apartment at the end of the day. The smell of her perfume was already fading, the space where her things used to be gathering dust. When he woke up in the middle of the night after having a nightmare, he would reach out to her side of the bed, each time having to remember again that she wasn't there anymore, and he would feel the panic rising. Harley had helped by giving him a rare sense of safety that he hadn't felt for years, and now it was gone. His demons seemed meaner somehow, the ghosts colder in her shadow. Still, every morning he would get out of bed, eat some protein and go to the gym. The reverberation of his punches against a bag or a face, always soothed his nerves. Especially when Colt was dancing around like an idiot, cheeks rosy with jubilation. \"Tommy, my man! I am the best damn manager in the whole fuckin' world because, guess what, I got you a tryout with Troy!\" The way he said the name with some kind of reverence told Tommy he should know what he was talking about but he didn't pay much attention these days. \"Troy?\" he grunted. Colt sighed, exasperated. \"Yes, Troy! It's like a… sequel to Sparta. Same organisers as before but bigger space, bigger fights, bigger sponsors and, most importantly, a bigger pay out. Rumour is they're doublin', man, can you imagine? That would set you up for life. Think of all the media attention we would get!\" Colt slapped him on the back, over the moon. Tommy just shrugged. \"Sure, whatever. When is it?\" Not put off by Tommy's lack of enthusiasm, Colt nudged the new receptionist - with Tommy spending so much time on fights, they'd put some young kid on the desk. He didn't like to think about it because it meant thinking about when Harley had walked through the door, and, well, we all know how that ended - who gave him the gym calendar. \"Next month. You're gonna have to commit to this, Tommy, give it everything you've got. Troy is smarter and meaner than Sparta, so you're gonna have to be the smartest and the meanest. Think you can do it?\" Preparing for a trial like Troy was just what he needed to keep his mind on better things. Focus everything into his fists, blind to all else. It had worked before, it would work again. \"Sure, I'm up for that.\" Colt nearly whooped in delight, fist pumping the air before darting off to his office, muttering about sponsorships and interviews. Tommy just shook his head and began to wrap his hands, the ritual of the moment enough to let him switch off. Here he was again, he thought. Here he was again. It hadn't stopped raining since she had arrived, which was comforting in a way. It was easier to wallow when it was raining. The first few weeks of being back had been a whirlwind of administration, procedures and signing documents. It had been tiring but Harley had appreciated the lack of time to think about anything except the next thing to do. Except now there wasn't anything left on her list and she found herself at a standstill, feeling lost in the one place she knew better than anywhere. She had hoped that being back in her old haunts would be reassuring but they just seemed old now, worn and run down. They had lost their energy - or, maybe she had. Either way, she avoided them, preferring to stay in the house instead. She couldn't bring herself to call it home, not yet. The apartment was home. Tommy was home. The off white place she had lived in for most of her life was just a shell now. Her father was nowhere to be seen and her mother occupied an urn that had been a nightmare to get through security but now sat on the mantelpiece where a broken clock used to be. A few friends had dropped by when they got wind that she had returned, demanding recitals of her time there, each one more painful than the last. She had kept Tommy out of it but she couldn't dodge the hard truth of her mother, no matter how many details she skipped over. When her best friend had dragged her into a painfully tight hug, Harley had finally let herself cry though she didn't mention that half her tears were for a grumpy ex-Marine who she dreamed of every night. \"Girl, you look exhausted,\" Holly said, her shrewd stare making Harley squirm. She had known the mouthy redhead since they were kids having grown up in the same street, and normally she would trust her with her deepest, darkest secrets but Tommy wasn't something she wanted to share with anyone. \"I feel it,\" Harley said instead, looking away. \"I think I need to rest.\" Holly watched her for a beat longer before giving up with a sigh. \"Good idea. You know where to find me if you need me.\" They hugged again and Harley took a moment to appreciate that at least she had someone to turn to if she wanted. She hoped Tommy felt that he had the same, that he would reach out to Brendan, hell even Colt if he wanted to. The idea of him being alone in that little apartment saddened her. Still, sleep was a good idea so she went up to her old bedroom and fell face first onto the bed. The sheets smelled dusty - they were the same ones that had been there since she left - but before she could even muster the inclination to do anything about it, she was out. The next day, she busied herself with tidying up the house to get it back to a semi-decent state. It appeared that her father hadn't been back to disturb the dust as all his things were still gone which she hoped would be a permanent thing. He would have found out by now that his wife was deceased from all the paperwork she had filed, but she hadn't heard anything from him but she took to be a good thing. The last thing she needed was him crawling his way back into her life when she had cleaning to do. The fridge was stocked, the trash had been taken out, the electricity meter was topped up. It was getting easier to think of the house as home and when more people dropped by, she was prepared, able to reel off easy answers and navigate the potholes that Tommy's absence left in her story. She would even crack jokes and when Holly took her out for lunch one day, she had lost that suspicious glint in her eye. The old air of London settled back in her lungs and she let herself be lost in the familiarity. The dreams didn't stop but she didn't want them to. Even halfway around the world he kept the nightmares at bay and she felt a little less alone when she turned the lights off at night, the memory of him keeping her company. It was a pale comparison but she would accept the crumbs where she could, still believing that she had done the right thing. The pain she felt without him was a worthy sacrifice to the life he was now free to lead and eventually, the weight of missing him became just another thing she had to learn to live with.

THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) all the hardest, coldest people you meet were once as soft as water and that's the tragedy of living - 19 - With the Troy tryouts just around the corner, Tommy spent every moment of daylight training for it. If he wasn't at the gym pounding the bags or in the ring, he was running around the block or lifting tires by the railroad. He didn't have a trainer dedicated to him, only the guys that Colt had brought in to look after the team, but he was okay with that. It meant that he had a reason to push himself, to keep his mind only on the task at hand. There was no chance of a pretty dark haired woman slipping into his thoughts when he had the biggest fight of his life on the horizon. Colt was loving his commitment even though he knew where the fire was coming from. Still, from suffering comes victory, he would tell himself as he watched Tommy decimate each of his opponents during practice. He had a list of sponsors as long as his arm calling him every day and he could practically hear the green coming in. He took care to only speak to the ones that he thought Tommy could handle - or who could handle Tommy - just relieved that this time around he was open to sponsors at all. Interviews though were a different story: his fighter didn't want anyone asking questions about his personal life which Colt respected. It was still miles more than he had been given last time. The prize had been confirmed at ten million dollars. Tommy had seen Colt's knees go weak at the prospect of getting even a cut of that sort of money. It was a huge payout but Tommy just cared about the fights. If he got money at the end of it, that was just a bonus. He would take what he needed to get by and give the rest to people who actually needed it. With winter rolling in and the days getting shorter, it would be dark by the time Tommy would get back to the apartment. He would throw his gear down in the same place and go find something to eat. Once he had eaten, he would shower and go to bed. Some nights he slept, some nights he didn't. He had learned to stop counting because he was alone either way. One morning, just as he was about to leave, Brendan called him. Tommy went to hit ignore but then hesitated. He was a man of solitude but for just a moment he felt like a kid again, wanting to hear his brother's voice because then everything would be okay. \"Hello?\" \"Hey, brother. Hope I didn't wake you, I'm just heading to work. I wanted to catch up, see how you were doing?\" Trust Brendan to keep to his promise, to look out for him even now. He kept expecting his brother to disappear again but then he would remember that he had been the one to leave, not the other way around. \"I was about to leave for the gym. I'm tryin' out for Troy in two weeks,\" he added, not sure how Brendan would take the news but then he had his brother give a whoop of excitement. \"I was hopin' you would! You're gonna smash it, Tom, I know you will! I'll be there, rootin' for you the whole way!\" Tommy believed him and that spoke volumes of how far they'd come. To know that after everything, he would have someone in the crowd cheering him on, it meant more than he could probably ever tell Brendan. \"Thanks, man,\" he said, throwing some bottled water into his bag. \"What does Harley think about the whole thing? She worried? I know Tess freaked out when she found out about Sparta.\" Tommy came to a standstill, her name tolling like a bell in his ear. He hadn't told Brendan because he didn't know how to get the words out and that hadn't changed. Colt had pieced it together himself and no one else at the gym had said anything, not even Mad Dog. \"I don't know, she's… she's not here.\" He rubbed a hand over his eyes, hating this shit. \"What do you mean?\" \"She left, went back home and she's not, er, she's not coming back.\" He was trying to convince himself more than Brendan who paused, the static in the line sounding too loud. \"Where's home?\" he asked. Not here anymore, Tommy thought. \"London.\" Brendan sucked a breath in between his teeth and Tommy imagined his expression. \"Yeah, so.\" He shrugged to himself and carried on putting his things in his bag, throwing it over his shoulder unceremoniously. \"Tommy, I don't know what to say. I thought it was serious between you two?\" This was exactly why Tommy hadn't wanted to say anything to anyone, because saying that everyone leaves is the kinda shit that makes people feel they have to argue and why bother when it was true. \"Yeah, well.\" Brendan sighed, sensing that was all he was going to get out of his brother over the phone. \"Okay, man. Hey, how about you come over this weekend, just you and me? We can grab some beers or whatever.\" It was an obvious play and Tommy's instinct was to say no. He wasn't the guy that kicked back and talked but this was his brother. He'd never thought he'd have the opportunity to grab a beer with Brendan but here it was. \"Er, sure.\" \"Great! I'll drop you a text later, alright, man?\" They said goodbye and Tommy forced himself to leave the thoughts of his brother, of her behind in the apartment. If his punches were any harsher that day, no one said a thing. It turned out to be the day for family talks because when he pulled up in the lot at the end of the day, Paddy was stood outside the apartment building. When he saw Tommy get out the car, he pulled off his cap and began to wring it nervously in his hands. His expression was wary but Tommy didn't have the energy for a fight, so he just nodded towards the door with his head and they walked up together in silence. \"Coffee?\" he asked as Paddy took a seat on the sofa. \"Yeah, son, thanks.\" His voice shook from age and it was so different to the man who had screamed at him as a child. Time really had taken its toll on Patrick Conlon. He handed him a steaming cup and sat back on one of the armchairs, his body aching from his workout. \"What you doing here, Pop?\" Tommy sounded as weary as he felt which he supposed was a good thing if Paddy had come here ready to pick a fight. \"I heard 'bout you an' that girl,\" Paddy said, looking anxious. Tommy raised an eyebrow, knowing that he hadn't heard it from Brendan. \"Your manager told me,\" he explained at Tommy's look. \"I came by the gym to see you as you hadn't been over in a while, and that man told me 'bout the girl and your tryout for that new event, er, Troy, is it?\" Tommy nodded, irritated but not surprised at Colt's big mouth. \"Yeah, not long now,\" he murmured, scratching at his face. The atmosphere was uncomfortable but he let his father say his bit, seeing how he'd made the effort to track him down. \"What you come here for, Pop, eh?\" Paddy nodded, fidgeting in his seat. \"I wanted to see how you were… the last time we, er, spoke, you told me you loved that girl. What happened, Tommy?\" Here we go again. What was it with everyone wanting to know all the details about his life. They didn't care before, Tommy thought caustically. But then he sighed. That wasn't fair. Goddammit. It was easier being the angry dick to everyone rather than trying to be rational and understanding. He'd never talked so much in his life. \"She had t'go back to London an' she didn't,\" he coughed, uncomfortable, \"she didn't want me t'go with her.\" \"Why not? Did somethin' happen?\" There was something odd in his tone and when Tommy studied his expression, he knew what it was. There was an expectation there, like when someone was ready to hear the worst. The rage that he had thought he was too tired to feel flared and he leant forward, each word grating. \"Nothin' 'happened', Pop, I ain't like you. \" Even the suggestion that he would ever do anything to hurt Harley made him feel sick. Paddy flinched and dropped his gaze, ashamed. Tommy wanted to tell him to get the hell out but he was too angry to form the words. \"No, Tommy, you're not,\" Paddy said after a moment. He sounded sad, seeming to wilt under Tommy's stare. \"You never were like me, son, neither was Brendan. I've always been grateful for that. Of course nothin' happened.\" This calmed Tommy down enough that he could take a breath, the anger dissipating in a rush, leaving him feeling more tired than before. \"She just… had her own life to lead,\" he finished and Paddy shook his head. \"I'm sorry, Tommy,\" he grumbled, and Tommy shrugged. \"Yeah. Me too.\" There was a long silence but all things considering, it was one of the more pleasant ones between them. Tommy rested his head back and stared at the ceiling while Paddy stared down at this hands, two generations of a broken family, lost. \"I'm sorry.\" Tommy glanced at his father whose hands still twisted and turned his hat. \"I'm sorry for bein' a shit father, for forcin' you an' your Ma to run away. I'm sorry that I wasn't there when she died, or when everythin' happened with the Marines. I'm - I'm just sorry,\" and then he was crying, pressing the cap to his face, bent over as he wept. It was surreal at first and Tommy just stared in shock, watching how the man's shoulders shook up and down, the way his cries croaked in his throat. The last time he had seen Paddy cry was at the hotel but he'd been steaming, drunkenly reciting literature until he was red in the face. He had been able to deal with that Pop but now, this sober shell of a man? It was harrowing. Tommy got off the chair and pulled his dad up from the sofa, wrapping his arms around him. Paddy clutched to him, crying into his shoulder with an intensity that almost disturbed Tommy. Where had this come from? \"Pop, it's alright, it's alright,\" he soothed, the words sounding wrong in his voice. He rubbed Paddy's back a little and then straightened him out, holding him at shoulder length. \"You're sorry, I know. I hear ya.\" He couldn't bring himself to say the words I forgive you because he wasn't sure he did. But he didn't doubt now that Paddy really was sorry and even if that didn't do much to fix everything that had happened, it was something he had expected to hear from his Paddy Conlon. Baby steps. Tommy encouraged Paddy to finish his coffee before he went, watching the older man throw it back like a shot. Old habits die hard, he guessed. Their goodbye was brief but not awkward, Paddy's spine a little less crooked as he left. \"What a fuckin' day,\" Tommy muttered but nevertheless, he slept well that night. This chapter was (re)written on 11 July 2017. The quote is from I Wrote This For You by Iain Thomas. AN - I'm back! I originally uploaded this as a rewritten chapter because I already had up to 21 chapters, but during the rewrite (which is now complete!) I've changed enough of the plot that it was a completely different chapter. Since it's been a while, I suggest you go back and reread because it is pretty different to the story before. Chapter 20 will be up soon, hopefully tonight! Thank you all for your patience, I can't believe it's taken me nearly 2 years to finish this rewrite but after doing the last couple of chapters in a few days, the end of the story for Harley and Tommy is in sight, I promise. Please leave a review! xo[Chapter 20] NEW! THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) i feel like every future i planted was in the row of your palms how am i supposed to move on - 20 - Harley had mastered the art of pretending to be okay and she was pretty impressed with herself considering she held in her hand all the ingredients required to have a fucking disaster. All the money she earned from the job she'd managed to secure at the cafe down the road went straight to paying the mortgage for the family sized home she now occupied alone. The fridge was more often than not stocked with wine and bread instead of any actual decent food, the sofa had broken so she would sit on the floor to watch television, and she kept falling into the holes in her life made by the people she had lost along the way, but no one knew that, so she was doing pretty well, she thought. She had everyone fooled. Well, except for one. That damn redhead and those cunning eyes, they were going to be the death of her one of these days. They were sat eating McDonalds in her kitchen, a half bottle of wine between the two of them. \"You're lying to me, I can tell,\" Holly said for the probably the sixth time the last hour as she shoved some fries into her mouth. Harley just rolled her eyes and finished her burger, hoping having her mouth full would mean that she wouldn't have to respond but Holly wasn't one for giving up. \"You are!\" she insisted, brandishing a pickle like a sword. \"You lost something out there.\" \"Yeah, my mum,\" Harley retorted but Holly just waved her words away, all the tact of a tank. \"No, not that. Something else. You've got the look of regret about you.\" Damn her. \"Come on, just tell me, I'm your best friend. I won't judge.\" \"It's, it's nothing,\" Harley sighed and Holly lit up like a christmas tree, victorious. \"Ha! I knew it, something did happen and it's obviously something or you wouldn't be moping so much.\" \"I'm not moping!\" God, she really shouldn't have said anything, the girl was like a dog with a bone, she was never going to let this go now. In all honesty, she knew she could tell Holly the truth - hell, she would probably feel better for it. But she felt that if she admitted to someone else how much she loved Tommy, how much it was hurting to have to live her life without him… well then she would have admit it to herself, and that would make it too real. \"Yes, you are. You're hurting babe, I can see it. Just tell me, I'm here for you!\" It all came out in a rush, words and stories tumbling together onto the table for Holly to see. She told her everything, left nothing out. Holly sat wide eyed but silent as she was walked down the path of those three months of Harley's life, both the beauty and the tragedy. From her mother's suicide to her own hospital trip, the meeting with Tommy's father, and then his brother, Harley left no stone unturned, no secret untold. It was like she couldn't stop until finally, painfully, she was done. There was a deep gulf of silence as the pair of them digested what had just been said, but then Holly reached out and grabbed Harley's hand. Her bright blue eyes were searching, reading the nuances in Harley's face. \"Harley, for the love of all that is holy, why did you tell him to stay?\" It was the same question that had spun around her head ever since she had gotten back. No matter how many times she reassured herself, she always find her own answer wanting. \"He was doing so well, Hols, he was patching things up with his dad, he was getting somewhere at the gym! You should have seen him when I first met him, he was so angry, so hopeless - but by the end he was lighter, brighter, y'know? He deserved to have that life.\" Holly stared at her like she was a fool, her look almost pitying. \"Harley, babe… did you ever think that maybe he was doing so much better because of you?\" Holly's look was pointed but Harley just scoffed and took her hand back. \"Don't be ridiculous!\" \"Harley, honey, I love you, but you can be such an idiot sometimes!\" Harley looked affronted but Holly didn't give her time to argue. \"When you first met him, he wasn't doing so well, right? And who could blame him? I'd practically be catatonic if I'd had to go through half of what he did, but it seems to me like he wasn't looking to change - but then you come along! You helped him, you loved him, Harley, and it made him better. He was happy because of you - and you just left him!\" Harley stared at her friend, stricken. It had never even crossed her mind that their relationship and Tommy's wellbeing had any correlation… but then she thought about the ways that Tommy had impacted her life. He had been there the whole way after her mother's death and she knew without a doubt that the grief would have swallowed her whole if Tommy hadn't been there to keep her head above water. The way he made her feel reflected on the choices she made in her own life, the strength he would give her just by being there transferring over even into London now. Could she really have meant that much to him? \"You say that you left him behind so that he could live a good life but you're the reason he wanted that life. Then you just… left him.\" \"God, stick the knife in, Holly,\" Harley muttered but she knew her friend was right. Fuck! She had thought she was making the right decision for Tommy but she had only succeeded in making them both miserable. It all became too much and she put her face in her hands, feeling her tears fall between her fingers. She could feel a sob building so she gritted her teeth against the drowning sensation that was overwhelming her. \"I've really fucked it up, haven't I?\" Holly quickly moved to hug her from the side, rubbing her arm. \"You can still fix it! I bet he's waiting for you.\" \"I bet he hates me!\" she cried, no longer able to hold back her sobs. \"I bet he fucking hates me!\" Holly laughed at her dramatics, sitting up. \"Don't be such a drama queen, of course he doesn't hate you. He's probably hurt, maybe a little bit pissed, but he won't hate you, Harley. You love each other! He'll get over it.\" Harley wasn't so sure but she was damn well going to find out. Here he was, drinking a better and sitting in his brother's lounge like they weren't broken people. There were children laughing in the next room, there were goddamn birds singing outside the window; he could almost pretend that nothing was missing, that he was whole. Someone on the TV scored a goal and Brendan cheered. There was nothing forced here, Tommy thought. This home was built on a foundation of happy times, made by people who loved each other. Not for the first time, he wondered what his life would have been like if he had been raised in a house like this. Would the demons have ever learned his name? Tess came by to bring them food and more beer, ruffling Brendan's hair as she walked by. His fingers laced against her hip and for just a second, they caught each other's eye and smiled. Tommy saw it and felt like he had been gutted hollow. Brendan saw his look and when Tess had gone, he turned down the television. \"Talk to me, brother,\" he prompted, looking every bit his age - but with wisdom, not misfortune. Tommy grumbled a little, scrubbing at his face. He hated talking but it was difficult keeping it in after learning how to let it out. Harley had taught him to talk and then had left. Who else was there left to talk to but Brendan? \"I don't know, man,\" he said, because he didn't. Brendan laughed a little and Tommy shot him a look. \"Sorry, it's just… you're so in love, aren't you?\" He laughed again and Tommy groaned. \"I never thought I'd see the day but I hoped, man, I really did. If anyone deserves to find love in this messed up world, it's you.\" \"We've hit this part of the day already, have we?\" Tommy joked but Brendan dismissed his poor attempt to avoid the subject. He didn't have to pretend with Brendan, he'd been through it all: found himself a high school sweetheart, had two beautiful kids and a stable marriage even all these years later. In Tommy's eyes, he was the expert at love. Fuck it, he thought. Now wasn't the time for pride. \"She left me, Bren'. I thought we had somethin' but she just… left.\" \"Tommy, she legally had to leave, it wasn't like you kicked her out of the country.\" Then he winced, recalling the first time he'd met the woman but Tommy didn't seem to notice his poor choice of words. He was staring at the beer in his hands without seeing it. Brendan sighed. Tommy never got distracted: it really was serious. \"She told me she didn't want me to go after her,\" Tommy insisted, like he was trying to get Brendan to admit that there really was no future left for them, that it was over. Maybe if someone else said it first, he could accept it too. Except that he didn't want to. \"Did she say why?\" \"She didn't have to. What did I have to offer her, huh? What life could I have given her?\" Brendan was dismayed that his baby brother thought so little of himself. He didn't know where he would find someone better than the man who stayed by his mother's side, alone and underage, watching her die; the man who ripped the door off a tank to save a stranger; the man fought to get to the top of a championship just so he could donate the winnings to his best friend's widow; the man who invited a grieving girl into his home and cared for her unconditionally. The man that forgave his brother for abandoning him as a kid. \"A great one,\" Brendan proclaimed, his gaze so intense Tommy struggled to meet it. \"Brother, you love her. What better life could she ask for? I saw the way you two were together - she wanted a life with you, Tommy.\" \"Then why did she leave?\" Tommy sounded so miserable that Brendan wasn't sure what to say, but then his beautiful sunshine daughters saved the day, like they always did. \"Uncle Tommy, why are you sad?\" asked Emily from the doorway, Rosie at her side with a toy rabbit hanging from her arm. The innocence in a question so direct had Tommy reeling but Brendan just offered a knowing shrug. The genius of children. \"He's missing someone he loves,\" Brendan finally answered when Tommy didn't. The two girls exchanged sorrowful looks before bounding over, hopping up to sit either side of him. This was the first time he was interacting with his nieces directly and he couldn't believe how beautiful they both were, how… happy. This was how children were meant to be, bold and unafraid. \"Oh no!\" exclaimed little Rosie, her bottom lip coming out. \"That is very said.\" \"Where did she go?\" Emily asked, the pair of them leaning against him without any inhibition. They weren't wary of their bear of an uncle, just pleased to have someone else to play with. \"The other side of the world,\" he replied, his arms automatically coming round to steady them as they clambered onto his knees. Brendan grinned: there was a look of wonder about his brother. \"Well, go get her!\" Emily demanded, a little furrow in her brow. Brendan spread his arms wide, triumphant. \"You heard the woman, brother. Go get her!\" The quote for this chapter is by the amazing Raquel Isabelle de Alderete, also known as r.i.d. or inkskinned. xo[Chapter 21] NEW! THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) everyone wants to be the sun to lighten up everyone's life but why not be the moon to brighten in the darkest hour - 21 - This time, Harley didn't even bother packing anything more than a carry on bag, not wanting to waste time having to wait around collecting her luggage. The sense of urgency stormed like the ocean within her, refusing to abate. She cursed herself for ever thinking that she had the control over what Tommy should do with his life, acting like damn martyr to a cause that wasn't even real. She loved him! She loved him! If only he would forgive her, take her back and she would never leave him again. \"Here, I found something! Your mum was born over there, right?\" called Holly from the kitchen where she was reading through all the immigration pages she could find. Harley had gotten her new application for a visa waiver approved which was all she cared about but Holly was thinking ahead. She didn't doubt that Tommy would take her back but Harley wasn't so sure - she just wanted to have her chance to tell him the truth. \"Yeah, she moved here when she was a teenager.\" \"Ooh, that's good! It says here you can apply for citizenship if you have a US citizen for a parent at the time of birth and they lived in US for at least five years!\" Holly could hardly contain her excitement but Harley wasn't ready to give up her hopes yet. Just one thing at a time, she told herself. \"How about I first see if Tommy wants to see me again, then we can talk about citizenships or whatever.\" Holly tutted at her friend's lack of enthusiasm but kept researching. Meanwhile, Harley was rooting around in her desk for the envelope of dollars she'd had leftover from her last trip and stuffed them into her purse. Her heart was pounding, her hands shaking but she refused to lose her nerve. Her love for that gruff man had knotted itself into every aspect of who she was, it wasn't something she could ignore any longer. In her arrogance, she had pushed him away but nothing could sever the bond they had, not even her own stupidity. At least, that's what she hoped for. Maybe Tommy had moved on, maybe he was thankful that she had decided to leave. Perhaps he had realised in the space she had forced upon him that she was right, he did have the chance at a better life without her around. The very thought made her eyes well up so she quickly cast it away. There was no point thinking the worst until she had spoken to him, face to face. Until then, she would remain hopeful. The doorbell made her jump but she heard Holly scrape back her chair, so she continued to charge around her room, grabbing socks and underwear, trying to find a clean pair of pyjamas. \"Have you booked your flight already?\" Holly called up to her as she passed the stairs. \"Nah, I don't want to be put on hold for an hour. I'll just get on the next one I can when I get there,\" she replied before running into the bathroom to sweep whatever was on the shelf into arms so she could chuck it on the bed. Anything that counted as a liquid she did not have time for and discarded it straight away. The length of the flight was going to be hard enough without holding herself up at the gate because of perfume . \"Hey, Harley? I don't think you're going to need to worry about that flight.\" Harley rolled her eyes impatiently, hoping her friend hadn't 'helpfully' booked her onto a flight by accident. With her luck, she'd end up in a different state. With an agitated sigh, she hurried the stairs to see what Holly was going on about this time. \"What are you talking ab-\" Holly was stood in the front hall, her face lit up with pure excitement, and beside her was a man she had never expected to see under her roof. \"Tommy?\" It wasn't until the plane took off that Tommy had a moment to think about what he was doing, and he was glad for it. He'd been worried that he would talk himself out of it if given the chance so he had got his things, booked a flight and got on the plane as quickly as possible, with Brendan sending him encouraging texts along the way. Now, with over eleven hours ahead of him, he could relax: he was on his way. The city below lit up like fireflies under the night sky, getting smaller and smaller until all he could see was grey and purple clouds. It would be morning in his time when he touched down but afternoon in London, so he knew he should get some sleep to avoid being jetlagged but his mind was racing. He hadn't told Colt that he was leaving, knowing that the manager would have freaked out this close to the tryouts and that was time he didn't have to waste. He hadn't told his Pop either but he probably wouldn't even know he was gone, which he felt almost sad about. The only other person who knew he was leaving was his landlord who he had just texted in case he came round while he was away. This kind of spontaneity wasn't something he was used to. Impulsive choices made because out of anger, sure, but not hopping on a plane to track down the woman he loved who had very clearly told him to not do that. Well, he supposed, she could tell him again to his face if that's how she really felt - which, he admitted, was a possibility. He could be flying halfway around the world just to get rejected again but he had to try. He owed it to them and that time they had spent together to at least try . Brendan had given him something else on his way out but Tommy wasn't so sure. There was being spontaneous and there was being unrealistic. He didn't want Harley to feel pressured or guilted into anything, he just had to know if there was a chance that they could make this work. They could figure out the specifics later. With his thoughts in the clouds, the journey went by quicker than expected and before he knew it, they were touching down. The clouds were grey but the sun was shining and as the Captain welcomed the passengers to London, it hit him that he was really here. Now he just had to find her house. Luckily, Harley had left copies of her travel documents from her first flight back at the apartment which included her home address. Ignoring how damn creepy he felt, he had searched for her house on Google Maps so he knew what it looked like and then had tucked the paper into his wallet. Now, he showed it to the taxi driver at the airport who nodded and told him to climb in. It took about an hour to reach her street and as he paid the driver, the man helpfully pointed at the house he wanted. \"Good luck, mate,\" he said with a wink and drove off, leaving Tommy bemused, and as he stare up at the front door, a little scared. He wasn't sure how long he stayed stuck in the spot until he heard his niece's voice in his head. Well, go get her! His hands shook a little from the adrenaline so after he had rung the bell, he stuffed them into his jean pockets. His reflection was staring back at him through the opaque glass panelling and he wondered whether he should have freshened up first but then the door opened, revealing a tall redhead with vivid blue eyes. \"Hi there,\" she greeted, looking him up and down expectantly. \"Hey, er, does Harley Sinclair live here?\" He prayed she would say yes because otherwise he would start having to go to every door like a madman or, you know, a salesman. For a very awkward minute, the woman just stared at him with wide eyes, then she gawked. \"Oh my God, you're him aren't you? You're Tommy?\" she exclaimed, her voice low. Before he could respond she grabbed his onto his jacket and dragged him unceremoniously into the hallway. His first reflex was to resist but the fact that she knew him was a good sign and she seemed more excited than dangerous. \"Yeah, I'm-\" he started but the redhead shushed him, sneaking a look over her shoulder towards some stairs. His heart began to race - was she here? \"I can't believe you're here, this is so crazy! I knew it though, I knew it!\" Tommy was half amused, half wary of the woman's enthusiasm. With far too much familiarity, she threw her arms around his shoulders, squealing a little in his ear. Tommy tensed but she didn't seem to notice. \"I'm Holly by the way, her best friend. The moment she told me about you, I told her she had to go see you - but here you are!\" Okay, he liked this girl no matter how overly tactile she was. \"Is she here?\" he asked, desperate to see her. Instead of replying, Holly turned to yell up the stairs. Tommy heard movement and then footsteps on the stairs. He had goosebumps, everything inside of him vibrating as he waited to see her, and - There she was. The afternoon sun from the skylight haloed her from behind, her wild hair spilling down her shoulders, green eyes downcast as she hurried down the steps. He saw Holly turn to him out of the corner of his eye with a wide grin but he couldn't tear his gaze away from the woman he loved, descending like a dream made manifest. When she saw him, she stopped in her tracks. He couldn't help but smile as she said his name, the green of her eyes more beautiful than he remembered. \"Hey, baby,\" he said, and then she was there in his arms, shivering like a leaf as she buried her face into his neck. He noticed Holly slip quietly into the kitchen to give them some space and he mouthed thank you as she left. \"You're here,\" Harley whispered into his chest and Tommy gently pulled her back so that he could look at her, his thumb wiping at her tears. \"Yeah, I'm here.\" She looked dazed almost, like she didn't quite believe what was happening. \"But… why?\" Tommy laughed and was surprised at himself. \"Why else? I love you, baby. I know you told me you didn't want me to come with you but-\" He was abruptly cut off when Harley slapped her hand over his mouth, something vulnerable in the seagreen of her eyes, the curve of her lips. \"I was coming back to you, I was just about to leave! Jesus, Tommy, I wish I could take that back, fuck, I wish I had never said that. I thought that by letting you go you would be free to live this…\" she gestured wildly with her hand, \"happy life. Everything was going so well for you, I didn't want to ruin it.\" He couldn't help it: he laughed again. The ridiculousness of it all, of them. Trust them to be given something so precious, so good , and be so damn terrified of it. In the midst of their grief they had found happiness - and ran from it. \"I had a happy life because of you, ya silly woman,\" Tommy scolded and Harley smiled for the first time, still a bit teary. \"I had a happy life because of you, too,\" she whispered, seeming very young in that moment. She was scared, it was easy for him to see and he was determined to prove that there was nothing for them to be scared of, not when they were together. It was then that he remembered Brendan's last minute addition, that little glint in his eye as he'd slid it in the Tommy's coat pocket. Tommy had thought that the timing was wrong, had been afraid of pushing her away further but now, holding her in his arms, damn near screaming with joy, he knew that it was now or never. So, without further ado, he slid out the velvet box and got down on one knee. \"Oh my God,\" Harley murmured, and he heard Holly swear from the kitchen where she was peering out from around the corner. There was a million reasons whirling around his head why this was the wrong thing to do but then he saw the way she lit up like the northern star and decided they didn't matter. \"Harley Sinclair, will you do the honour of being my wife?\" Harley couldn't believe it. She wanted to pinch herself to make sure she wasn't dreaming because that's what it felt like. Tommy, turning up on her door to propose to her after she told him to not come after her? This was the soppy sort of shit she would imagine as she lay in bed, cursing her ability to fuck up every good thing that came her way. \"Really?\" she asked before she even knew the words were coming out. She cringed but Tommy just laughed - my god, she had never heard him laugh so much or seen him so jovial - unphased by her response. \"Yes, baby, really.\" \"But you're not worried that it's too soon? We've only known each other for three months!\" He shrugged and she had to admit, she was liking this side to him. \"It's enough. We've been through hell t'gether, baby. What more do we need to do to prove that we're meant to be together?\" What more, indeed. When it felt like her world had collapsed, Tommy had been the one to help her put it back together again. He had given her his secrets to safeguard and she had walked him through his darkest of nights. Their time apart had been agonising, the ghost pain of something she had thought forever lost, but here he was, kneeling before her like she was the sun and the moon and all the stars, wanting her to share his life. There was good in this world, she thought, and you had to hold on to it. \"Yes!\" she cried and and offered him her hand. The ring was beautiful, a warm gold leaf band with a large inset diamond that had her heart racing, and it slid on like it had been made for her. Harley jumped into Tommy's arms as he came to a stand, wrapping her legs around his waist and kissed him with all the desire, joy and devotion she felt for the man. Her man. Her fiancé . \"Oh, this is so romantic!\" Holly crowed from the doorway, clapping her hands together as the engaged couple kissed and laughed and cried together. \"This is crazy, right?\" Harley said in his ear, sounding breathless. Tommy spun her around and kissed her again. \"The craziest.\" The quote for this chapter is by... well, in all honesty, I don't know. I googled and googled but couldn't find the original author. Sorry! We're nearly finished, guys! The next chapter is the penultimate one, but it's a pretty hefty chapter to get through everything. Please let me know what you think! xo[Chapter 22] NEW! THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) i made this place for you a place for you to love me if this isn't a kingdom then i don't know what is - 22 - Before marriage comes war, they say. They being Colt, and he didn't really say it so much as screamed it. Tommy appreciated the sentiment nevertheless. Once his manager had calmed down enough for Tommy to assure him that he wasn't planning on dropping out of the tournament, Colt managed to actually congratulate him on his engagement. He was engaged. It still didn't sound real to him, like he was caught in a nightmare that started off like a dream. Each morning he would rush to check that Harley was still there at his side, afraid that one day he would see that he had never gone to her, that she had never said yes. But she had. She had. The pair of them had been inseparable in the days after the proposal, hiding out in Harley's childhood bedroom, huddled on her tiny single bed, making out like teenagers, fucking like convicts. They weren't even entirely sure how many days had passed until Tommy turned on his phone to see a load of texts, mostly from Colt panicking that he hadn't turned up at the gym for training, but some were from Brendan demanding to be told the outcome of his impromptu visit across the pond. It was time to face the world, so they eventually got out of bed and started making calls. Harley really only had her boss at the cafe to tell, trusting Holly and her big mouth would take care of their circle of friends, while Tommy told Brendan, Pop and Colt, each of them with their own vastly different reaction. Brendan was unabashedly ecstatic, yelling down the phone so loud Tommy had to hold it away until he'd run out of steam. He took a decent chunk of the credit for the engagement since he had been the one to slide their grandmother's ring into the luggage, which Tommy supposed was fairly due. He could hear Tess in the background laughing so hard at her husband's childlike glee that she couldn't get a word out. Paddy was understandably wary. He'd only meet the woman once and wasn't sure that Tommy could really be so confident in knowing a person in such a short space of time, but he let himself be reassured by Tommy telling him that he was, for the first time since he could remember, happy. \"That's all that matters, son.\" Colt was, well, Colt. The only thing he cared about was whether Tommy was going to get his ass back to country in time for the Troy tryouts. Normally his shitty attitude would have Tommy wound up but this time he just laughed, not even his cranky manager breaking through his good mood. He assured Colt that he would be back in plenty of time for the tryout, that he was planning on seeing the tournament through to whatever end. He had spoken about this with Harley before his call, not wanting to make any assumptions. He had broached the subject with an expectation she would want him to miss the tryout. When they'd been together in Pittsburgh, she had only seen him in working out at the gym as he hadn't done many professional fights while his shoulder fully healed, so he wasn't sure how she would take to the idea of seeing him in the ring for real. Harley's response had surprised him and he remembered to never assume her opinion again. \"Why wouldn't I be okay with you doing Troy? You love fighting, I don't have to have seen it to know it. Anyway, look at you!\" she tried to wrap her hand around his bicep and failed. \"You can't let all this go to waste. You're like a beast!\" Tommy had laughed, rolling them over so that he was gazing down at her, the softness of her curves protected by the size and strength of him. He would never let anyone hurt her, he promised in his mind. \"Plus, that cash prize will come in handy for the wedding dress I've got my eye on… \" \"Oh, I see how it is,\" he retorted, making her snicker. \"You're only with me for the money.\" Harley did her best to shrug with him hovering above her, her expression one of pure innocence before it tumbled into a grin. He bent down to ensnare her mouth with a long, lazy kiss and she almost purred into it, encased as she was. It was precisely where she wanted to be. \"You're too skinny,\" Tommy mumbled against her mouth, making her pull away with an eye roll. \"Way to ruin the moment,\" she muttered but he ignored her. \"I told you, all my money has been going to the ridiculous mortgage my parents had been paying, I didn't have a lot left to play with in the fridge department. Anyway, I was this size when I came to Pittsburgh in the first place - it was you who fattened me up with all those breakfasts you made.\" \"Yeah, 'cause you were too skinny.\" When she went to retort, he just stole another kiss, his eyes mischievous when she frowned. \"I'll just have to make you breakfast more often.\" \"Well, I'm not going to argue with that,\" Harley said with a smile, and Tommy wondered why he felt like he had lost that one. \"In the meantime, you'll just have to make do with what I've got.\" Without hesitation, Tommy began to massage her breast, his tongue darting across her nipple, making her shiver. \"I'm sure I'll manage,\" he said as he dropped kisses along her collarbone. \"Oh, what a hero.\" Her tongue was sharp and her eyes sparked with a wicked look as she wrapped her legs around his waist, arching her back with a moan as he pushed inside her, and together they were lost in the madness they inspired. They returned the following day to Pittsburgh. Harley marvelled at the way this new city felt more like going home than London had, but she supposed that had more to do with the man at her side. She saw the way people glanced at him, the way they hurried to get of his way. It didn't surprise her, he was like a bear in man's clothing and with those granite eyes and hard jaw, he had the look of danger about him. She barely stopped grinning the whole way back to the apartment. The tryouts were like auditions, Tommy explained to Harley while he got his gear together, so it wasn't really the place to bring people with him. His tone had been apologetic, so she had just leapt at him without warning, knowing he would catch her, and kissed him as hard as she could muster. His lips were like a drug to her, leaving her overcome with addiction each time. \"Go win for me,\" she'd whispered after and there was fire in his eyes. He would dare down the gates of hell for this woman, he could sure as hell win a tryout; and he did. The Friday before the tournament began, Brendan and Tess invited the couple round for celebratory drinks. Tommy had told Harley about his conversations with his brother while she'd been away and she was so glad they were facing up to the choices they had made and those that had been made for them. Forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting, she'd said to him, it just means moving forward instead of looking back. They accepted the invitation gracefully, determined to step outside of the shadow their last meeting had cast. If Tommy had thought his sister-in-law would show them her back, he was much mistaken. As soon as they were through the door, she had taken Harley's hands within her own, her face open and earnest. \"I'm sorry for being such a massive bitch,\" she'd said without censure and Harley had laughed a little before pulling the woman in for a hug. \"It came from a good place,\" Harley said as they pulled apart, smiling. Their men had watched on, bemused but relieved. \"That was easy,\" Brendan teased and the women shrugged, sharing knowing looks. Tess had weathered the absence in her husband's life a lot longer than Harley did but they both knew the shape of it well. \"All things are, if you let 'em,\" Tess had replied before whisking the future bride off into their kitchen to show her the wine selection, the first of many Conlon Wife stories already on her tongue, leaving the brothers behind. There was a long stretch of silence as they listened to the sound of laughter and storytelling, the quiet comfortable. Tommy turned to Brendan and nodded as if answering a question that had gone unsaid. \"You made the right choice, Bren',\" he said. \"I can see that now.\" Brendan's eyes glossed and he rubbed them, taking a shaky breath. Tommy hadn't quite realised how much those words would mean to him and was all the more glad for him saying them. Unable to formulate the right thing to say in response, Brendan embraced his baby brother, clapping him on the back. Tommy held and let himself be held, feeling both like the beaten kid and the healing man. From the kitchen, Harley and Tess watched with soft, unsurprised smiles. It felt as if a breath that had been held for a lifetime had finally been released, and the air was so much sweeter on the other side. \"Success,\" Tess whispered in her hair and Harley hid a laugh, the pair of them moving away to fill their glasses, the look in their eye smacking of a hard won victory. Later on, the four of them raised champagne flutes in the dining room with the sound of the newscasters discussing the upcoming tournament in the background. \"Here's to family and forgiveness,\" said Brendan, \"and all the things in between.\" \"Here's to love and war,\" said Tommy, \"and all the things in between.\" \"We made it, guys,\" Harley finished, and they brought their glasses together with a clink. The Troy championship was a hurricane that raged through their lives, throwing everything into the air, refusing to let them settle. Though she wasn't planning on staying for the ninety days this time, just a couple of weeks, Harley had expected to utilise the time she had in Pittsburgh to research into how she would get her green card, how she would sell the house back home, and just exactly what she would do once she had moved over. She had known straight away that it was better for her to move than Tommy because he had a whole life set up in Pittsburgh whereas she had only the frayed remnants of one back in London. It was easier for her friends to travel to see her than it was to expect Paddy or Brendan's family to travel. So, having even a small handful of weeks was the perfect time to get all the preparation in check, or so she had assumed based on only a minor interest in Troy on her part. Turns out she greatly underestimated just how much she of a MMA fan she was deep down. Together with Brendan, she went to every one of Tommy's matches, often with Tess or even Paddy tagging along. There was little room for any awkwardness to settle in between the two generations of Conlons as most of the time was spent on their feet and yelling. Harley had expected the anxiety of watching Tommy fight but she hadn't expected the exhilaration she would feel at seeing Tommy being crowned victor after victor after victor until it all came down to one last fight. \"He's going to win it,\" Tess said very matter of fact from where she stood at the stove. Tommy was finishing up doing the latest rounds of interviews, having already done a photoshoot in the morning for one of his sponsors. She'd tried not to but Harley had to laugh at the petulant way Tommy would deal with the events Colt set up, still hating all the attention even this time around. Nevertheless, Harley would send him off with a kiss and he would get the job done with as little fuss as possible. Meanwhile, Harley was spending a lot of time around Brendan and Tess's house as the stadium was nearer their place in Philly, and the nearly five hour drive had done her in the first time round. The organisers had put up the contestants in their own hotel but it was frowned upon for them to have guests - the reporters that had tented up outside loved it - so Tess had insisted for her to stay with them rather than book another hotel or do the drive for each match. At first she had been worried about intruding but they had all quickly gotten into a routine, plus the two girls loved having yet another playmate, especially one who had endless patience when it came to tea parties and watching Disney Channel repeats. \"Don't jinx it!\" Brendan scolded, looking aghast. Harley laughed as she fetched the dinner plates and began to set the table. The girls were washing up and there was just one last guest they were expecting before Tommy arrived. The doorbell rang and everyone froze, look of doubt crossing their faces, but then Emily was running to the door yelling \"Grandpa!\", Rosie close behind. Brendan shook himself free of reeling thoughts and rushed to get there before his girls, opening the door to reveal Paddy, his cap in his hand. \"Hi, Pop,\" Brendan greeted, trying to invoke as much normality into his tone as possible. Paddy nodded and walked in, giving his coat to his son to hang up. Harley watched from the kitchen as he peered around the house and she was reminded of when she first saw it, the way it overwhelmed her, made her feel very small. Her heart softened against the old man at the memory. \"Grandpa! Grandpa!\" chirped Emily, jumping with her arms outstretched. Paddy hesitated, but his look of approval to Brendan was received with a nod so he crouched down and let the little girls swarm him, holding them both as tightly as he dared. \"Hello there, Emily,\" he said, voice a deep rumble. \"And this must be baby Rosie! Though you're lookin' pretty grown up to me!\" The sweet girl played with the hem of her dress, all demure. \"Come on, Pop. Dinner's nearly ready.\" Harley and Tess stood side by side like their own little army but there was no anger or unease in them as Paddy approached them, bowing his head a little out of respect. These were the women who showed his sons how to love, he knew. They had healed what he had broken. He would always be thankful for that. \"It's lovely to see you again, Paddy,\" Harley said with a look that shone. \"Please, take a seat, I'm just about to plate up,\" encouraged Tess, gesturing to the table. Brendan sat at the head, leaving the other end free for Tommy when he arrived later. Paddy sat to his left, with the two girls next to him, while Tess and Harley took the right side. The conversation flowed as everyone made an effort to keep it so, wanting to focus on the good they had collected between them, not the things that had been left behind. Plus, the cheerful chatter of Emily and Rosie had them laughing often enough, and they were doing just that when Tommy arrived. \"Evenin',\" he greeted, unsurprised by the presence of his father as it had been his idea to invite him. He had already showered and changed at the hotel, so he headed straight over to the table, pausing only to drop a kiss on Harley's temple before sitting down. His nieces waved jubilantly at him and he stuck his tongue out at them, earning himself a giggle while Tess handed him his plate. \"She even made you a special 'healthy' meal,\" Harley told him. \"We got pasta and cheese, so I think we got the better end of the deal.\" There were no fights, no arguments, no raised voices - except when they started to discuss which of the Terminator movies were the best - and at one point during the evening while everyone else was engaged in conversation Harley leaned over to Tommy. \"This is what family looks like,\" she whispered and he kissed her, chaste but filled with all the things he couldn't say at the dinner table. She hadn't been the one to give him this family but she had helped him become the person that allowed himself to be a part of it. The final match took their lives by storm. The very city seemed to vibrate with adrenaline, the evening sky dark and clear, the stadium lit up with lights like stars. The rumble of the crowd and music could be heard from outside and as the Conlons and Harley were led up to their seats, it rolled through them like a war drum. Harley let Tommy have his own space before each match and that night was no different, but she had broken the 'no guest' rule of the hotel to sneak into his room, needing to see him before he left for the fight. He had still been asleep as she had straddled him, littering kisses up his chest until he awoke slowly, groaning a little as she rocked her hips against his. \"My champion,\" she whispered in his ear, her tongue hot against the pulse in his neck. \"I've not won yet,\" Tommy murmured, enjoying being woken up with his woman on top of him. Harley shrugged and pulled off her top, smirking when Tommy's eyes widened at the pretty lingerie she had on. It wasn't the best she could find - she was saving that for their wedding night - but it was enough for Tommy to roll them over, nestling within the crook of her legs. \"You're always my champion,\" she replied with an exaggerated purr and then they were done talking. A few hours later when Tommy really did have to leave, he helped her sneak back out of the hotel wearing one of his hoodies to hide her face from any reporters who might be by the side door. Just as she left, she went up on her tiptoes to give him a kiss on the cheek. \"Go get 'em, tiger,\" she said with a grin and Tommy rolled his eyes, unable to stop from smiling. Her laughter followed her out as she crept back to her car, managing to escape any prying eyes. The whole thing felt a bit scandalous but they were engaged, he thought. Who could blame him? That final fight was nigh on biblical. It was long and hard, tougher than any that came before. Both opponents were fighting for more than just cash, it was clear to see. The commentators fought to be heard over the chanting and cheering of the crowd. There were men and women in uniform, lining the stands, giving their support. But none were as loud as the small family by the front: Brendan and Paddy swung with Tommy, shouting out technical sounding names of moves, while Tess and Harley just jumped and yelled and cheered. Harley felt close to tears but refused to let them fall, not wanting to miss a second of the fight. It seemed to stretch on forever, each punch Tommy took feeling like a stab in the gut. But then the opponent - my God, Harley couldn't even remember his name, she was so shaken - finally, finally hit the mat and stayed down. There was half a second of pure silence and then the ground shook, the room swelling with screams of such volume, Harley's head swam. She wasn't at all suited for the environment but she didn't care and as soon as Tommy was crowned champion, the four of them were pushing through the crowd to get to the cage. Tommy's hand was being held up in triumph and he seemed dazed as if he had never quite expected to see the day. Harley banged on the door and called his name, begging him to hear her, and he did. He turned, their eyes catching like fire, and he marched towards her, throwing open the door with all the flare he was known for. And then he was pulling her up into his arms, her legs wrapping out of reflex around his waist, and he was kissing her, kissing her in front of the whole world. Harley could hear Brendan and Tess laugh at their antics and she smiled into his mouth, tasting sweat and victory. \"You won,\" she said. \"Thank fuck,\" he whispered. \"Don't know how we'd afford that wedding dress otherwise.\" With an extra couple of million in the bank, it was easier to make decisions. Such is privilege, Harley thought as she packed her bags: their flight back to London was the following day. It had barely been two weeks but it felt like a lifetime. Tommy was coming with her since he had six months free reign in the UK before he needed any sort of visa, lucky sod. She originally was going to go by herself so that Tommy could deal with the aftermath of becoming the Champion of Troy, but after discussing their next steps, they decided that it would be easier to get married in the UK. There were a number of routes Harley could go through to obtain a green card: her mother was a US citizen, and there were visas open to her through being engaged to one, but they decided it was safer to wait until they were married and go down the spousal route instead. Tommy had been excited when he'd discovered that as a veteran, they would be able to expedite her naturalisation but Harley had just rolled her eyes. One thing at a time , she said, let's get me living there first . Which meant that wedding planning had suddenly become a priority. On the plane, she had gone through magazine after magazine, trying to get a feel for what she wanted. She had picked up things along the way in her life by seeing what friends had chosen and watching wedding programmes, so she had a vague idea of what she liked. Every so often, Tommy would peer over her shoulder and point out something he thought looked nice, which she appreciated. She had worried he would be one of those guys who just saw a wedding as an expensive party but he seemed to be as interested in it as her. \"I'm on television now, babe,\" he's scolded, semi-serious. \"I can't be seen at no shambles of a weddin'.\" She'd hit him then and he'd kissed her in return, eyes glinting with laughter. The first thing though was to buy the wedding rings. Harley adored Tommy's grandmother's engagement ring, simple yet with a touch of vintage elegance, and so she wanted something that would compliment it. High on his winnings, Tommy initially took her to all the big names in jewellery but Harley wasn't swayed by the modern perfection in the rings she saw. Eventually Tommy found a little quaint jeweller's on a dark corner, one Harley hadn't even seen before, and tugged her inside. Her gasp as she studied the rings was enough to make him smile. In the end, she picked out a slender twisted rose gold band that was dotted with delicate flower-like diamonds, and Tommy selected the same design albeit in a wider, platinum ring minus the diamonds. The man who sold them took both their hands after and wished them all the happiness in the world. It gave Harley a warm feeling as they carried their rings back to the house, desperate as she was to marry this man she loved so much. Time passed quickly as they were too busy getting their lives in order to have much down time and the time they did have was often spent in bed, indulging their addiction of one another in a way they had never dreamed of. To think, Harley thought, the last time she had been at that house, she had thought she would never see Tommy again, and now they were soon to be married, making love every night and nearly every morning, planning the rest of their lives together. When Harley stumbled upon a website for a unexpected wedding venue, she knew immediately it was the one: Mount Stuart House on a small island up in Scotland. She'd never been that far North but loved the idea of the rolling hills and crashing waves as a backdrop for their ceremony. Tommy liked the look of the place and they arranged a trip for a viewing. When they saw the ceiling of the marble hall, even Tommy's mouth dropped in awe, the way the sun hit the stained glass making the whole room flood with colour. \"It's beautiful,\" Harley breathed, their guide smiling. \"This is it, this is the place we're getting married.\" It turned out that recently coming into a lot of money was also a solid way of ensuring they were on the bookings list despite the short notice. The manager's face had lit up at the sum Tommy promised and though Harley scolded him for his flagrant use of corruption afterwards, she'd done it with a wide grin because she was so deliriously happy. The next few weeks were filled with appointments to see caterers and bakers and centrepiece makers. Harley took Holly and Tess, who had flown out especially, to go to dress shopping. There had been a shop called the Blush & Ivory that Harley had walked past as a girl and had fallen in love with the beautiful designs in the window, so it was the first place she had gone to book an appointment. Holly and Tess quickly acquainted themselves over a glass of bubbles as they sat on the white sofa in the viewing room, the consultant whisking Harley away for a fitting. It took a couple of dresses but when she had walked out in a Julie Vino dress to stand before her friends, the pair of them gaped at her in wonder. It wasn't a style she had expected to like as it was a little bit risque, a touch loud, but when she saw herself in the wide mirror, she was certain nothing would compare to that dress. She imagined Tommy's face seeing her walk down the aisle and knew that it was the one. Tess stayed long enough to appreciate the city gilded with Christmas lights and she walked arm in arm with Harley through Oxford Street and on, the pair of them admiring the decorations while amongst the bustle of holiday shoppers. After a while, they found a cafe near Covent Garden and they sat with their hands wrapped around a hot chocolate each, watching the world go by. \"I'm glad you're here,\" Harley said, meaning it. Tess had become an unlikely friend, the two of them bonding over their love for Conlon men. It wasn't an easy love, Tess would tell her, her wisdom well earned, but it was worth it. \"So am I,\" replied Tess with a warm smile, so very happy that her family had gained someone who, fundamentally, understood. They were like sisters now and soon they would be in truth, forever the guardians sworn to protect the ones they love. \"They've seen so much pain,\" Tess told her once. \"It creeps in, even now, when Brendan thinks I'm not looking. Our beautiful girls healed much of it, but it will always be there, a scar that never quite goes away. It hurt me at first but I understand now. Some things, when learned, aren't meant to go away.\" \"They wouldn't be who they are without it,\" Harley agreed, for it was something she had learned in her own life. The things she had experienced as a child, the struggle it had been to care for her mother only to watch her die, it had changed her - but who would she be without it? Her love for Tommy had been formed in the very depths of grief, a love forged in the darkest flame. It was how it had always meant to be. Nevertheless, every so often Harley would have to stop and pinch herself, it felt so much like living in a dream world. The fairytale life had never been on her horizons, so to have it now, to have all the things she had ever hoped life would bring, it brought her near to tears each time she thought about it. Tommy, her champion, her protector, her goddamn soul mate, had promised to always be by her side, to always love and cherish her. He wanted to share her life and what did she do to deserve it? At night, she would worship him like a deity, offering praise as she took him in her mouth, laying her body down like the sacrifice. The failing light of the darkening sun would strike her body as Tommy took her, her spine concaving under his touch, a holy reckoning she never saw coming. Her name fell from Tommy's lips like a prayer and bathed in moonlight she came like the sundering of great cities. When Christmas came, they sat around a small tree glistened with blinking lights of reds and golds, a slightly battered star resting proudly on the top. They didn't go to the effort of having a proper Christmas, knowing they would do it as big as possible next year when they were married, but it was beautiful all the same. Some of Harley's friends came round with presents, all eager to meet her husband-to-be, and though she was sad to have her first Christmas without her mum there, there was so much happiness to be found that she felt filled to the brim with it all, bursting at the seams. Tommy's mouth was on her as the countdown to the closing of the year began, and when the bells tolled in the New Year, she came with a cry that felt like the throes of salvation. When Tommy joined her on the bed to kiss her, he was as one who had been remade. \"Happy New Year, baby.\" It was difficult to organise a proper bachelor and bachelorette party with the half the people on the very short invite list being in another continent, even with all the extra cash. Harley suggested that Tommy fly back to Pittsburgh to see Colt and his brother, but he wasn't eager to spend a whole day in the air just for a party themed on him grieving single life. He just wanted to get married and finally be able to call Harley his wife. \"You're meant to go see strippers and whine about how you'll never have sex with another woman again,\" Harley said casually, but Tommy just scoffed. \"Who needs any of that when I have you?\" he asked, embracing her from behind, kissing the back of her neck. Harley grinned, never getting tired of that drawl of his. \"How 'bout we have a party where you dance around naked and we have sex after?\" Harley laughed loud, charmed in a way. \"Normal evening for us then,\" she teased as she turned to face him and he gave her a lopsided smile that made butterflies flutter in her belly. When he pulled away, something caught her eye, changing her mood. Tommy sensed it but waited while she thought. \"It's not exactly a party, but how about we take a trip somewhere instead?\" she asked, moving into the lounge to gently brush the back of her hand against her mother's urn. Tommy watched her with a soft look. \"I've left this for so long but… I think it's time. I think it's time for me to let her go.\" So, instead of throwing a party to say farewell to the single life, they decided to say goodbye to the lonely life. Together they travelled down to the coast in Dover; Lily had told her daughter tales of visiting the white cliffs where she had walked as a girl with her father whenever she had struggled with being in a new country. Her childhood had been a pleasant one and Harley wanted to honour that time her mother had by letting her find peace in the cliffs for a final time. They made their booking and then one early morning, Tommy and Harley walked up to the very edge of the cliffs. It wasn't too cold a day despite the time of year but the wind was brisk, sweeping past them with a wildness that took their breath away. The sky was clear and the winter sun was bright, a perfect day. Harley held the urn, the weight of it almost comforting. \"Thank you, mum,\" she murmured, her words lost in the great heights of the cliffs. \"Thank you for everything you did for me. I want you to know that I'm happy, just like you wanted. I'm so, so happy. I got my happy ending; now it's time for you to have yours.\" With a deep breath, Harley removed the lid and tossed the ashes out over the edge of the cliff. The wind caught them and swept them up like autumn leaves and Harley watched, Tommy at her side, as they danced in the breeze, almost jovial and quite beautiful, before falling down towards the stormy waves that crashed against the rocks. \"Be free,\" she whispered and she let out a deep breath. There had been a heavy burden in her heart for a long time, and she had thought that her only choice was to get used to carrying it. Now, the loss became light within her, and she didn't feel angry any more. The quote in this chapter is from Snow and Dirty Rain by Richard Siken. I said it was going to be a long one and I hope I delivered. Only one more chapter to go! Please leave a review, I would love to hear what you think. xo[Chapter 23] NEW! THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) one day you will meet someone who will see the universe that was knitted into your bones and the embers of galaxies that glow to life in your eyes and you will finally know what love is supposed to feel like - 23 - The day had come: she was getting married. From the moment the alarm clock went off, Harley felt that if she moved too quickly, she would crack from the pressure of excitement, and shatter into a million pieces. It bubbled inside of her, making her fidget and bounce on her toes as she stared up at her wedding dress hanging on the wardrobe door. It was really happening. In the nature of tradition, Harley hadn't seen Tommy since the afternoon before. She wondered whether he was feeling the same as she in that moment, nervous for the day ahead but in a good way. Only ever in a good way. The venue had hosted the wedding party for the night, a separate wing dedicated each to the bride and the groom which took away the hassle of having to travel. Harley had fallen in love with her room instantly with the huge bed, rose wallpaper and white tulips that filled the space with a delicate perfume. The sun was already shining lazily through the Victorian windows which she threw open, letting the warmth soak into her skin. She allowed herself a moment to think of her mum and it was a quiet wave of sadness that passed over her and was gone. Neither of the couple would have their mothers present for their wedding day but they knew how proud of them the women would be, and that they would honour them with their love. A young woman brought through a breakfast tray with fresh orange juice and yoghurt with fruit, and wished her a very happy day. Harley could only beam back at her, thinking that if she started to say how thankful she was, she would never stop because she was so thankful, for everything. Of all the steps that had led her here, she couldn't bring herself to regret a single one. It was easy to hear the bridesmaids arrive, their excited chatter echoing through the marble hallway. Harley let them in and they leapt at her, screeching in a way with left her in fits of giggles, wiping at her eyes. Tess was the only one who stayed back but only because she was carrying a number of takeaway coffee cups, the nearest one with 'BRIDE' and a love heart drawn on the side. Harley took it gratefully and kissed her almost-sister-in-law on the cheek, so very pleased she had agreed to being part of the big day. \"Right!\" called Holly, clapping her hands together to grab their attention. She had taken her role of maid of honour very seriously, and already she was brandishing her camera, insistent on capturing every moment of the big day. \"The hair and makeup team should be here any minute, so lemme get a pic of us all in our robes!\" They all squashed Harley together in a big hug for the photo and she was gripped with a fierce love for all of them. Along with Holly and Tess, she had two other women, Melanie and Anna, who had been students with her at the performing arts school, one a dancer like her, and one a theatrical singer. Harley had been worried that there might have been some awkwardness as they were all from such different backgrounds but the the four of them had immediately banded together, friendship forged from being determined to give the bride the best wedding there was. Tommy had flown in his family a week before the wedding so they could have a little vacation in London to see the sights before they travelled up together, which allowed for the bridesmaids to meet for the first time. Holly, dismayed that her best friend had robbed her of the chance to throw her a hen party, had dragged the women out for a night of cocktails and gossip, and the five of them hadn't stopped laughing once. Now, here they were getting ready, the hair stylists working their magic while the makeup artists organised their brushes and palettes. There was something very opulent about having a team of people do your hair and makeup, especially when the coffee was finished and the mimosas were brought out. The women worked quickly and soon she was being helped into her wedding dress, careful not to catch the lace as it was fastened. The skirt of the dress was quite revealing and so for the ceremony Harley had opted to have an additional skirt that had a long train to made it most modest and traditional. Plus, she thought it be would be fun to see Tommy's look afterwards when she took it off - she wasn't usually the risque type but it give her a sense of thrill. Next came the veil which was a cathedral style with lace detailing on the edge. The idea of mixing a more modern look with traditional elements was mimicked through the entire wedding, ivories and pastels put against bright shocks of colour. The bridesmaids wore dresses that were long and floaty, each one a different shade of pale dusty blue, peach and cream, and they all wore flower crowns that matched Harley's bouquet. It was all a little bit quirky but Harley and Tommy had liked it that way, the feel that it was all truly individual to them. Once she was ready, Harley was allowed to see herself for the first time as the bride. A full length mirror graced the wall and her little audience watched from the side as she took it all in. Her bouquet was made up of flowers of deep red and peach, mint and faded blue, and long trailing mint green leaves; a happy bundle of flowers that seemed to carry summer within their petals. Her hair had been curled and twisted into an updo, with dainty flowers of white and blush dotted all over. Seeing herself, it seemed to hit her then in that moment: it was really happening. She was getting married to the love of her life, her soul mate, and she had never felt more beautiful in all of her days. It took all of her effort to blink away the few tears that had started to well. She sniffed a little and everyone laughed, sounding like they were having the same struggle. \"You look beautiful,\" Tess told her and the others agreed with so much enthusiasm, Harley chuckled. \"You all look so gorgeous,\" she told them as they collected their own smaller bouquets which matched the flowers in her hair. The hair and makeup team gushed over them all and took a flurry of photos with Holly's careful direction, finishing up any last second tweaks before they had to leave. The bridesmaids left soon after and Harley took a moment on the landing to just breathe, listening to the murmur of their guests below. The ceremony would take place in the old chapel so was to be watched over only by their closest friends and family, with everyone else invited to the party in the marble hall afterwards. It wasn't a huge gathering by any means but that made it all the more special, knowing that all those who meant something to them were able to share in this happy day. The staff had worked tirelessly through the night to set up the ceremony space and as Harley peered down onto it, she had to gasp. She had told them that she wanted fairy lights but that had been difficult to arrange so instead she saw they had lit what looked like over a hundred candles, some big, some small, all with little flames that flickered against the stained glass and vaulted ceilings, giving the impression of a grand painting come to life. \"Do you approve, lassie?\" Harley turned to see her consultant, a stout woman with a warm smile, watching her from the sidelines. She nodded, her throat too tight to speak. The woman just patted her on the shoulder then gestured to the sweeping staircase, the piano already beginning to sound. \"It's time, my dear. We don't want to keep your man waiting now, do we?\" The chamber from which the procession began was small and to the side of the chapel, large heavy drapes hid them from view. Harley arrived just as the groomsmen began the procession with Brendan, as Tommy's best man, the last to go but he saw her arrive and turned at the last moment to catch a glimpse of her. \"Wow,\" he mouthed, giving her the thumbs up before his wife shooed him out. Next went Tess, Melanie and Anna in single file while Holly straightened out Harley's train and veil, making sure they would sweep out behind her as she walked. \"I am so proud of you,\" the redhead told her, eyes glossy. Harley hugged her tight, then with a cheeky wink, Holly glided down the aisle. Rosie, the flower girl, hadn't wanted to be by herself so Emily had graciously deigned to give up her bridesmaid position for one as Senior Flower Girl (as she called it) so she could walk with her sister down the aisle. They both waved at Harley before they grabbed their flower baskets and followed Holly out, leaving Harley was alone. There was no father to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day but she wasn't sad about that. Each one of her steps would be her own; she didn't need anyone to give her away. With the piano as her guide, Harley stepped out from beneath the curtains and began her procession: her one last solitary walk. The aisle to the chapel was carpeted with petals, shadows thrown back and forth from all the candles, and there was the taste of magic in the air. The room fell silent with a hush as the guests turned to watch her but their faces had faded away until it was only her and the man stood waiting. Dressed as he was in a dark teal suit with a grey tweed waistcoat, a deep red dahlia tucked into his front pocket, there was the look of regality about him, her prince, her king. When Tommy turned to look at her, their eyes meeting with a battle clash, Harley felt consumed by fire, burning in the most beautiful way. His jaw dropped at the sight of her, those stormy eyes running the length of her body, and her steps quickened without intent, desperate as she was to stand at his side. Tommy didn't look away the whole time she walked the aisle until she was before him, his gaze raking over her with a hunger she would never tire of. Inside the main chapel where the guests were seated was a smaller, private room which only the couple, the best man, the maid of honour and the pastor were allowed to enter. Having not seen it before, Holly and Brendan hesitated as they followed the couple in and Harley wasn't surprised: the whole floor was made of mirrors so that that it reflected the ceiling which had been stylised to mimic the night sky. In the low light, it appeared that there was no floor, only empty space, requiring a 'leap of faith' in order to enter. Though separated, their guests could still see and hear them, the chapel reverberating their words up into even the lofty rafters. Yet when it was time for them to say their vows, it felt as if the whole world had fallen away, leaving naught but them alone among the stars. \"Harley, baby,\" Tommy began and the seriousness in eyes had Harley holding her breath. Tommy was a man of few words but this was the time he had to lay his heart out for the woman he loved, and nothing but the truth would do. \"You came into my life bringin' light when I didn't know anythin' but darkness. I had resigned myself to a life of solitude and loss, but then you showed me that I still had so much to live for, that I had a family to love and be loved by.\" Brendan smiled, head bowing a little, glancing out to where his father stood next to his daughters. They had all come together in celebration of Tommy's journey and he was so glad for it. \"Harley, you saved me when I thought I was past savin' and for that, I will never stop tryin' to be worthy of your love, to be able to stand at your side as your husband, your friend, and your equal. Throughout our life together, I promise to always be your protector, your supporter, your champion. I promise to always catch the spiders and let you sleep in on Sundays.\" The audience laughed and Harley giggled, wiping away a few stray tears, hoping she didn't ruin her makeup. Tommy grinned and her heart swelled so big, she thought her chest would burst. \"You told me once that it's not about winnin' the fight but havin' somethin' to fight for, and you're it, baby. I will always fight for you. This I vow.\" Harley wanted to sob, to throw her arms around Tommy and hold him so tight that he could never let go. This man, this beautiful, beautiful man had handed her his heart, his damn soul and she swore to the heavens that she would protect it for all time. \"Oh, Tommy! My love, my life!\" Harley exclaimed, her voice raw with emotion. \"I came to Pittsburgh ready to bury a life but I ended up finding one instead. You healed me when I didn't even know I was broken.\" She tried desperately to keep the tears at bay but her voice cracked with the weight of them, and Tommy smiled softly. \"You showed me that strength could be used to protect, not just hurt. That fire could warm, not just burn. Without even knowing it, you showed me that I could trust in a world that I had feared for so long. When I thought I would drown, you pulled me from the waters. When I thought I was lost forever, you found me.\" Many of their guests would assume her words were poetic but Tommy knew how true they were. He remembered the night he had found her, half dead in the swimming pool; the day he had arrived at her house, ring in his pocket - and here they were. \"Tommy, I promise to never judge you. I promise to always keep you on your toes, and to celebrate every victory with you. I promise to be there when no one else is. I promise to love you on your good days and love you more on your bad days. I promise that you will never have to face your demons alone again. This I vow.\" Tommy's eyes sparkled, his expression so tender that it made her heart hurt. She knew that he had never expected to see this day, that even after all her I love you's , he still struggled to believe it. She hoped, prayed, that he believed it now. They exchanged rings and the weight of them was more than the sum of their parts. Harley had to resist holding her hand out to admire the thing, knowing she would have plenty of time to do that afterwards. \"Those whom God hath joined together, let no man put asunder,\" declared the pastor. Then, with a great smile, it was done. \"I pronounce you Husband and Wife: you may now kiss your bride.\" The crowd came to their feet with an applause that echoed as Tommy dipped Harley low for a kiss that had them burning, gasping for breath. There was a wolf whistle and happy laughter, and they straightened up with breathless, sunny grins. Holly and Brendan quickly adjusted Harley's train as she turned and then they were all walking back down the aisle, the bridesmaids and groomsmen following them out. Taking the lead, the best man and maid of honour quickly hustled everyone out of the chapel and towards the marble hall where tables had been set up, while Harley and Tommy headed up the staircase and into the bridal suite. Tommy gave one last wave to their guests before Harley tugged him inside, closing the door behind him. \"We did it,\" she said, feeling lightheaded. They didn't have long until they were expected back down to greet their new guests but when Tommy gazed at her with that half feral look in his eye, already removing his suit jacket, Harley knew that they were going to be late. \"Jesus, baby, that fuckin' dress ,\" he exclaimed and Harley spun for him, the extended skirt and long veil twirling out behind like she was a princess. She was both coy and wild, made of wildflowers and the ocean, Tommy the moon that pulled her waves, magnetic. First she removed her veil and then her train, hanging them both over the back of a chair. Tommy's eyes were wide as he saw how the original skirt of the dress split from the waist down, revealing the length of both her long legs as well as the garter set she had on. It had been a little surprise for her husband alone, knowing that it would be hidden during the ceremony, and when she saw the way his hunger went taut then snapped, it made her feel as water, tied to the push and pull of him, always. Tommy lifted her into his arms without effort, his mercurial wife, and let her fall back onto the four poster bed. Harley sighed and spread her legs beneath his gaze, keeping eye contact as she traced her fingers slowly up her thighs, past her the suspenders and brushed against the edge of her white lace panties that left very little to the imagination. Breathing hard, Tommy went to his knees before her and mouthed against the flimsy fabric, already tasting the salt of her wetness there. Harley moaned, wanton, as he unclipped her suspenders and pulled down the panties enough that he could dip his tongue into the heat of her, sucking at her clit in a way that had Harley crying out, her hips bucking against his mouth. \"So eager,\" Tommy chided, earning a string of expletives that almost had him blushing. Harley pulled at his hair, demanding without words that he join her, and he did so without hesitation, rubbing his hardness against her as he stole a kiss, then another, and another. \"Oh God, please , Tommy,\" Harley begged without shame and Tommy held back no longer. With one hand he undid his trousers and then he was pushing inside her with one long thrust, enjoying the way her back arched beneath him, her head falling back to reveal the curve of her neck. He sucked at her pulse as she clutched at the bedsheets, unbidden, and they moved as one, reaching and reaching, climbing together until they came hard and glorious. After, once they had collapsed onto the bed beside each other, they began to laugh. Harley rolled over to cuddle against Tommy's chest and he kissed her temple. They lay there for as long as they dared, lazy in their contentment, until it was time to clean up and get ready to see their guests. Once Harley was sure that they looked as innocent as possible - a concept to which Tommy could only scoff, everyone knew what they had been doing up there, surely - they left the suite. They were introduced by the band and their guests applauded their entrance, some cheers and whoops thrown in for good measure. Tommy bowed and Harley curtsied before they sat down at the head table, their wedding party on either side. If anyone had worried about the speeches, they shouldn't have done. Brendan's was heartfelt, touching briefly on their troubled childhood in a way that didn't villainise Paddy but merely emphasised how far his baby brother had come. Tess kissed him sweetly when he sat down and Tommy gripped his shoulder hard. Holly's speech was a happy opposite, full of jokes and stories that had the audience crying for a whole other reason. Harley had to hide her face a couple of times, blushing as Holly took them all down memory lane, but she was grateful that she had a best friend able to remind her of all the good times they'd had when it was so easy to only remember the bad ones. After dinner, Tommy took Harley to the centre of the room for their first dance. Though they had never really had a 'song', it hadn't taken long for them to agree on the one they had wanted to play for this moment. When the music began, the lights dimmed and they began to dance in a slow circle, so close that Harley could hear Tommy's heartbeat. Brendan and Tess were the next couple to join them, followed by Holly and her girlfriend, and as the music changed, the rest of the guests slowly filled the floor. When the day came to its natural end, the newlyweds were bid farewell from their loved ones, so many kisses and hugs shared that Harley felt overwhelmed. Sensing this, Tommy quickly pulled her up into his arms, earning another round of cheers, and he carried her down to the town car that was waiting to take them to the ferry. Harley curled up in Tommy's lap for the short distance, hoping she would never come to take their closeness for granted. \"We did it, Tommy,\" she murmured, knowing he would understand. \"I know, baby,\" said Tommy, almost delirious with the wonder of it all. They had won the fight. The quote for this chapter is a poem called What Does Love Feel Like? by Nikita Gill. Final chapter, guys! I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. Please leave me a review to let me know what you think! xo[Chapter 24] NEW! THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) summer is known to be the season for us wild animals who keep our hearts in brambles who gain our magic at the heart of a storm break not, my love, winter has released us and the best is yet to come - epilogue - It was a beautiful day, the sun warm and bright. There was the smell of cooking in the summer air as the Conlon brothers wrangled with the barbecue, beers in hand. Lucky for them, Paddy was there with stern instructions to teach them how to properly grill burgers. Under the gazebo, wine glass in hand, Tess was recounting a story that had Harley laughing as she poured herself another lemonade, her free hand resting lightly on her bump. The pair of them looked up as the dog barked, Emily apparently taking too long to throw his ball. When she did, the golden retriever bounded off to fetch it, only to drop it loyally at her feet again after. Meanwhile Rosie, who was ecstatic at no longer being the baby, was showing her cousin how to make daisy chains, their little brows furrowed in concentration as they pieced them together. Tommy turned to watch the pair of them with a smile, seeing the way the sunshine glinted off his daughter's dark hair, as wild as her mother's. \"Hey, Sophie! Come an' pick your burger,\" he called, and the little girl immediately hurried over, letting him scoop her up into his arms so she could peer down at the barbecue in fascination, her serious eyes the same stormy blue as her dad's. The burgers all looked equally yummy to her so she just stuck out a chubby finger at the nearest one and her daddy nodded in approval. \"Good choice, princess,\" he said, giving her a kiss on the cheek before letting her back down. Rosie and Emily appeared at his side, wanting to pick theirs too. When done, they each took one of Sophie's hands and ran with her back over to the dog who had been waiting patiently by his ball. Tommy looked over at his wife and found her already looking at him. Their gazes caught and Harley winked at him, those green eyes always so full of mischief. Every day, he fell in love with her all over again, and the love he felt for his baby girl and unborn son consumed him so beautifully. Their fights were won. There were no more nightmares to be had. Surrounded by family, the sun warm on his face, Tommy was wholly and completely at peace. The quote is by Raquel Isabelle de Alderete, also known as r.i.d. on her tumblr inkskinned. Okay, so I lied - I had planned a little final chapter all along to show that Tommy finally gets his happy ever after. He deserves it so much, after all! I hope you all enjoyed this story, I'm sorry it took so long to complete but we got there in the end. Thank you for your reviews, I appreciate every single one of them. xo ","Summary":" REWRITE THIS IS MY SKIN (and it's thick. this is not your skin - yet you are still under it.) we al"},{"Movie":"Warrior, 2011","Title":"Violent Delights: Triumph","Author":"Okaybub","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8608694","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph Tommy Riordan/OC Rating: T - As a reader if you're adverse to any strong language, themes of violence or of an adult nature then discontinue reading.

Well you wasted my time too you little bi-' The familiar click of the phone on the other end was harsher than usual but I still slammed mine down too just to emphasize the fact I was very, very pissed off at the womans attitude just a moment ago. 'Lana...' 'What?' I snapped and then recoiled quickly as my boss, looking fairly annoyed and now astonished hovered over my desk. Her coffee was placed calmly on my desk as she cleared her throat and took the seat opposite mine. 'Ms Jamison I didn't mean to-' 'What? Swear at a client or snap at your boss?' I felt my stomach tie into knots and I flushed, embarassed at such a crude but truthful statement. The woman on the other end of the phone just moments ago had only called to cancel her sons AA meeting but with the day I've had already, I wasn't in the mood to play dutiful counsellor. 'Lana you're job is simple. Pick up the phones. You were demoted from desk duty and from refreshments - all you have to do is pick up the phones.' I wasn't a people person. It was just as simple as that. I was sarcastic, rude and my sense of humour tended to insult people - comes with being from England. Ms Jamison stood, brushed a stray hair from her suave grey skirt-suit and picking up her coffee, went on her way after making it very clear how easy and painless my job was. It was pretty obvious that any more complaints from clients who'd been mistreated over the phone, I was walking home with an early paycheck and unemployment stamped on my forehead. 'Rough day?' Glancing over at probably the only person who I got along with in this place, Kelsie McCormack placed her designer jean cladded arse on my desk toppling over some pens. 'More like disastrous.' I rested my face in my hands ignoring the phone that was ringing non-stop beside me. Working in Alcoholics Anonymous wasn't pleasant. People weren't calm, weren't civil most of the time and more often than not, they just wanted to go home and so dealing with people with pent up anger, frustration and a whole lotta issues wasn't new to anyone who worked in the AA offices. But somehow, it was always too much for me. I was the kind of person who will insult the way your hair looks just to overcome an awkward silence or the person who has never drank in their life but decides to joke about the vodka in front of someone who'd only just began the 12 steps. Kelsie rubbed my back comfortingly and with a snort she said, 'why is it the person who hates people can't get along with people who hate themselves?' 'Because their sob stories are boring.' And see, a sarky comment like that loses me a friend. I looked up just as Kelsie rolled her eyes. Kelsie was a therapist and sat in some of the AA meetings sometimes to overhear some of their dramatic stories and how long they've been sober and what abuse someone went through to turn to alcohol. And still at twenty-two years old, I've never drank enough to get drunk. Why do I work here? Because that two bedroom house you live in all alone torments you with a three digit number every month threatening to kick you out on your arse in the street if you don't work. 'There's a discharge this Saturday,' she said flicking through some files on my desk as I glared at the phone that was still ringing, 'wanna watch her go?' 'No,' I said quickly and giving in, I picked up the ringing device that was bound to make my ears fall off, 'Alcoholics Anonymous, Alana Drew speaking, can I help you?' The voice on the phone was one I was hoping not to hear again, 'oh, it's you - why is it every time I call this number, you answer? My son can't go to his meeting to-' I sighed, '-today because he's hungover from relapsing last night. So shove the illness excuse where the sun doesn't shine ma'am and I'll inform his mentor that his 12 steps are to be repeated next week when he isn't tempted by Mr Jack Daniels - thank you madam, have a lovely day.' Hanging up the phone I took a deep breath and looked up at an annoyed Ms Jamison who was in her office doorway. Brilliant... ~VD:T~ When I moved to Pittsburgh I didn't expect the weather being so similar to typical English weather. Constantly overcast, damp and you feel glum just looking at the sky, can't tell the difference between Summer and Autumn and having to carry an umbrella with you whereever you go - except for me who forgot today which is why I'm soaked to the bone and can't see more than a foot away from me. I don't live in the most expensive area but it could be worse. My apartment complex is in a quiet, suburban area where there aren't many supermarkets but there's a small array of necessary shops that get you through the week. Fumbling around for my keys, I unlock my small silver car and sit down with a heavy sigh. I hate rain. It's already dark outside and it's only six but today's work is over and I got away with slandering a client's mother witnessed by my boss...twice. A thump on my window makes me jump a mile and after a quick yelp, I brace myself with one hand on my seats headrest and the other on my steering wheel. 'Jesus!' 'Can you help me?' Because of the rain I can only make out a man... looks kinda old but doesn't look familiar. He doesn't look potentially dangerous but looks can be decieving after all. 'Probably not.' I mutter under my breath and skidding to the passengers chair, I wind down the window about an inch, 'why?' The man looks utterly soaked and he's breathing hard as if he's been running. 'My car broke down.' Resisting the urge to roll my eyes, I look at him blankly, 'if that's not a serial killer line I don't know what is. Phone a pick-up. Goodnight.' Just as I was about to sidle back to the drivers side, I hear a small chuckle and the man bends down so he's eye level with me. Bright blue eyes embedded in wrinkling, withered skin stares into my brown eyes and it's like he's looking into my soul - I totally knew he was a creep. 'I'm Patrick. I think I know you - do you work for AA?' He gestures to the building behind him and I nod slowly. 'Yeah, but I don't know you.' By his expression I could tell I was bothering him, he just wanted some help and I'm keeping him out in the rain accusing him of being a serial killer. 'Can I borrow your cell-phone? Or... are you from America?' 'No and no.' I say slowly and I look at him sheepishly, 'I don't mean to be rude but there are plenty of other people around.' Lie. 'And I don't have a mobile on me right now.' Another lie. 'I'm also in a rush.' And another. 'I can tell I'm obviously bothering you,' he said and backed away from my car, 'I'll just ask inside, I'm sure once I say what excellent service one of their workers provide for a fellow client, they'll be more than happy to oblige to help me. I'll tell them...' He peers into my car to catch a glimpse of my name-tag... Fuck! 'Alana Drew has a way with people.' I glare at him... clever, sarcastic twat. Huffing and cursing under my breath, I turn around in my seat and scamper through my handbag in the backseat pulling out my mobile. 'Cover it, if it gets...' Before I can finish my sentence he hauls the door open and without giving me much time to move over, he plops his backside into my passengers seat and shuts the door shaking his head leaving droplets all over my dashboard. 'Excuse me Patrick.' I'm stunned at this old mans audacity and hesitate for a moment before I give him my phone. 'Your phone would have gotten damaged out there,' his smile is friendly and I can't help but feel a little bad at the way I treated him. He dials a number on my phone and listens carefully. 'Tommy? I know you said not to call... I know. I'm in a spot of trouble. My car broke down...' I sit there awkwardly staring out into the rain as I hear someone on the other side of the phone sound not too happy at all that this man is calling him. Should've called car pick-up. At least they're paid to be nice to you. I glance at him as he rubs his forehead, this guy seems to be giving him a hard time whoever Tommy is. 'Can you just borrow the car in the garage and pick me up outside AA? Keys are in the drawer... It was your mothers.' This was obviously the wrong thing for the old guy to say because even I heard the click of the phone on the other end. This Patrick doesn't show any fault though in his front - he sits calmly and hands me back my phone, 'my son is coming to pick me up.' I sit there for a moment expecting him to get out but he doesn't. I'm not used to being in this kind of position, I've usually intimidated whoever I've encountered by now to have them turning to someone more pleasant to talk to. 'Do you mind if I wait in here?' He finally asks obviously not getting out even if I said no considering his intruding entrance into my car. And life. And credit on my mobile. I wave a hand at him and force a smile, 'obviously not.' 'Are you from England?' He asks after a moment and I nod my head not really interested in a conversation. I want this man gone - I don't care if he threatens me by walking into his meetings to tell his mentor and my boss all about my lack of civilisation. I've done my good deed for the week - now old man, bugger off. Of course I didn't say any of that. I have manners. 'How long is your son gonna be?' Patrick shrugs, 'I don't live far but he'll probably be as long as he can.' Nice kid, I thought with a roll of my eyes. A few minutes go by in silence and it's welcomed by me but clearly not by him. He's obviously used to conversation considering he keeps opening his mouth to say something and then shutting it again. He doesn't look tall or lanky. He looks like he could've been quite athletic at an early age. Obviously an alcoholic or he wouldn't be here. I'll have to check his file tomorrow at work or something. His eyes, although startling are tired. He looks mentally exhausted. Just then headlights appear in my rearview mirror and although I can't see the person inside, Patrick takes his cue to leave. 'Nice to meet you Miss Drew and thank you.' Although our meeting was met on impolite terms, his thank you is genuine and so is my 'no problem' that I say to him before he shuts the door of my car. Just as I'm about to pull away, I look up into my mirror to catch eyes with the driver of the car and his grey eyes meet mine in a kind of secret communication. He's obviously wondering who I am. I can't tell much of what he looks like but his eyes are beautiful - his face hidden by a shadow because of the dark outside and the overhead streetlight doesn't give much away. He also looks really cramped in that car he's driving, his broad muscles clear to see in his shoulders as his sillouhette almost shrouds the whole interior of the car. Hmm, I'll definitely be searching the Patricks in our system tomorrow. From ElloHarley(me!): Whaddaya think so far? I know his car doesn't break down in the movie but sue me, okay? Some events are gonna change. If there are any grammatical errors, I apologize, I haven't got a proof-reader except for myself and sometimes I might overlook something. Alright, so, thanks for checking out the first chapter. Song: Virgin State of Mind by K's Choice[Chapter 2] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : holds me in his big arms, drunk & I am seeing stars : Chapter 2: Meeting Tommy Riordan My apartment was one of the lucky ones. Or rather, I was. It was the kind of apartment with two bedrooms and a set of stairs so it seperated it from the apartments downstairs in the complex because it was more like a house. And everyone hated you for it. 'I don't understand why people give you weird looks,' Kelsie says loudly as Mr and Mrs Shraplot glance in our direction as we head towards the elevator the next morning. 'They're jealous of my crib,' I joke and watch Mrs Shraplot let out a surprised sound as if her and her husband have worked hard to shroud their jealousy and resentment towards me since I moved in. Kelsie holds her Starbucks in one hand and presses the call button with the other. 'So, this guy from last night, what did you say his name was?' 'Patrick.' I tell her pressing the ground button. I didn't mention the fact I'm going snooping into his personal AA file today. 'Patrick...' she urges and I shake my head, she ponders for a moment, 'could be Patrick Conlon. What did he want again? A ride?' 'My phone,' I almost roll my eyes at the upmost audacity the man had shown last night, 'but he might as well have grabbed a lift as well. Climbing into my car like that. What if he'd been armed or something, I could be dead this morning.' She looks at me as if I'm mental as we climb into my car, 'you should lock your doors anyway. Look, this car isn't big enough for a struggle, you'd be dead for sure.' I thank her sarcastically and pull out heading to work, my mission today not to piss off anyone, especially my boss. Later that day, I finally have a chance to check up on this Patrick Conlon. Typing his name into the search bar was the easy part, turns out there aren't many Patricks in AA. Patrick Conlon, coming up to his thousand day sobriety, has two sons and a deceased wife. That's all there is and I let out a disappointing sigh. That sucks. No mention in his file how he's attacked anyone although there's a comment from his mentor at the bottom that he has an estranged relationship with both sons and that he personally asks for no mention of his wife. Well his son isn't so estranged if he's living with him, I think to myself closing down the computer and taking a sip of my coffee. I spot Ms Jamison on the other side of the office and catch her wavering eye. She's obviously making sure I'm not making trouble. Just then as if to prove I'm still doing my job the phone rings. 'Alcoholics Anonymous, Alana Drew speaking, can I help you?' There's a disgruntled mutter on the other side but then a voice speaks up, it's a nice rough kinda voice. But he sounds annoyed. 'I'm calling for Patrick Conlon.' That is so effing weird, I take the phone away from my ear just to make sure I'm not imagining this and then take another look at the closed down computer. 'Erm, o..okay. Is he alright?' For once in my life I didn't make a sarcastic comment. 'His car has broken down so he's going to be late.' And because my stupid mouth hates me, I blurt out, 'Tommy?' There's silence on the other end before he speaks slowly, 'yeah? How'd you know my name?' I turn around in my chair as Ms Jamison looks my way thinking I'm making a personal social call on my work hours, I speak quickly into the phone before she comes over. 'Sorry, I just... I'm... okay, I'll pass the message along. Thank you for notifying us.' And I'm back on professional mode. I'm so embarassed I have to still my knees from shaking and as I turn back around, my curious (downright nosey) boss is stood there tapping her fingers against my desk. 'Who was that Lana?' 'Someone for Mr Conlon. Can you tell his mentor...' I glance at the chart of the list of names next to mentors, 'Paige that he'll be late for the meeting today?' She looks dubious for a moment but nods curtly, 'fine.' Phew, mission acomplished, I didn't piss her off. I did however make a fool out of myself - if this Tommy is hot, I'm gonna shoot myself. ~VD:T~ An hour before my shift ends I pass the meeting hall where all the AA clients are sat in a circle, I can recognize the old man from last night and see him nodding along to something a young woman is saying. I press myself against the glass window on the double doors and see Kelsie look very serious as she listens intently. I wonder if she's actually listening. All of a sudden, she stands up and flicks her blonde hair across one shoulder. My short dark hair that only reaches an inch past my chin is conscious of it and I tug it watching her say something quick and shoots them all a smile. They all bow their heads in thanks and pack their things up. Scooting away from the door before they all unload onto me, I move to the side only to bump into Patrick flipping Conlon. 'Alana Drew,' he says with a smile, 'nice to see you. Knew you worked here.' 'I'd say you're a stalker but it's clear you're here for other...reasons.' I say without thinking and catch his eyes droop the floor as if he's ashamed and I've just reminded him that he's here because he was an alcoholic. I don't bother apologizing. I figure I disappoint a lot of people and hurt their feelings, if I apologize it's a sort of promise it won't happen again and when my foots in my mouth, I can't guarantee that. 'Do you need a ride home?' His eyes look alarmed and he looks around as if I'm talking to someone else. I surprise myself at actually meaning the question. He doesn't say anything for a while and I begin to think he suspects I'm joking. 'Is your son coming again?' 'No,' he says quietly, 'it's not raining so I was just going to walk.' This man has a way of making me rethink the things I say sometimes. My heart strings tug in a way they haven't before. I'm actually feeling sorry for this old man. That's new. 'I can give you a lift.' I say and smile at him so he knows I'm not kidding. 'My car is outside...' I begin walking to the door and he doesn't move for a moment, 'if you'd rather walk...' 'No...' he says and walks next to me, 'last night you were a little...' 'Rude?' I open the door and the cold air hits us immediately, 'impolite? Uncomfortable? Yeah, I'm all those things but I know an old man with trouble walking when I see one.' He looks down at his knees as if I've uncovered a secret and gets into my car when I unlock it. 'Thank you,' he says with a fatherly kind of smile and I choose to only smile back tentatively. I don't need reminding of my father. My non-existent one anyway. 'Now, where we heading?' His house isn't overly big or small. It isn't in an overly rough or posh area either. It's a medium sized family home in a medium sized, normal neighbourhood. There's a car parked outside the house and another in the driveway with the bonnet up. 'This is you?' I ask and cut the engine off. He doesn't get out right away as if he's entitled to hug me in thanks or something and I start to get uncomfortable. I try and control my word vomit but I can sense an awkward situation so I can sense an insult too. 'Pop?' We both look towards the car with the bonnet up and see another man. Another MAN isn't how I'd describe him anyway. This man is a frickin' MAN. He's around six feet with shoulders as wide as a brick wall and a body so toned, it looks like I could run him over with a truck and I'd just bounce off. His tousled brown hair is cropped and his grey eyes are very familiar. Patrick gets out the car and I follow suit in politeness, I don't shut my door though and just lean on it and peer at Mr. Very Toned-Very Good Looking-Very Athletic-I Can Knock You Out With My Little Finger over the roof of my car. He rubs his hands on his grey T- Shirt that looks like was painted on him and grease stains it. He was obviously fixing the car. 'Tommy,' Patrick says, 'I just got a ride home. This is Alana.' So this is Tommy Conlon. 'Alana?' He wondered and seemed to look at me weirdly and then as if we both remember at the same time what happened earlier in the day, we widen our eyes and I look down resisting the blush that paints my cheeks. 'Thanks for the ride, Alana. My meeting is-' '-Monday. I probably wont see you. Bye...' I get back in my car and ignore the way they're both looking at my strangely. Tommy is obviously going to mention I said his name meaning they're both going to be discussing that I've been practically stalking them. I need to leave right now. I drive off without looking back in my rearview keeping my eyes glued to the road. My gut feels weird. Fluttery and tied up. Embarassment in front of an amazingly hot guy never goes down well. Damn my life.[Chapter 3] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : don't you dare look out your window, darling everything's on fire : Chapter 3: Coffee with the Conlons The weekend went by uneventfully and Kelsie called once to confirm our plans Monday evening - meeting at my place for alcohol. Tuesdays were our days off and we never made sure we were sober to enjoy it. When Monday rolled by however, I wasn't expecting to see someone I said I wouldn't. 'Patrick, what are you doing outside? Your meeting starts in three hours.' It was seven in the morning. Old man might not have plans but I have to at least earn my position in this line of work, I can't be seen talking socially to clients. Ms Jamison will have a field day with that, she'd probably think I've overcome by attitude problem and send me on camp with them or something. 'It does but I wanted to be sure to see you.' He tilted his hat off his head in a polite gesture and shifted his weight. I didn't wait for him to finish what he was going to say. I was freezing and although the coffee machine inside isn't Starbucks, it's better than freezing my ass off waiting for an old man to decide what he wants to say. 'Okay,' I breathed past him allowing him to make his mind up. Follow me inside and talk my ear off to go back home and continue our professional relationship. I didn't cease to notice his car parked beside mine either. He joined me at the coffee machine as I collected my coffee, 'your car is fixed then.' He nodded and took a swift look around the place he was due to be in three hours. I don't know how long he's been here, he was probably here before I began working here which is why he's looking at it with a distasteful look on his face. 'My son...' he trailed off and caught my eye but I pretended not to notice the curious look on his face. I am amazing at playing stupid. 'Speaking of,' he says and takes a seat opposite me at my desk. It was nearly empty bar some people who'd probably arrived at six just to make a good impression. Ms Jamison shows up half an hour late anyway, she's not here to appreciate their effort. 'Have you met him before?' 'No,' I say quickly and shake off the feeling he doesn't believe me. 'I barely even know you.' 'You seemed to know him.' 'His name,' I nodded and took a sip from my coffee, 'it's my job to keep up to date with clients files.' Patrick doesn't say anything for a long while and I begin to sense an awkward silence, 'mate,' I grab his attention more with my accent I'm guessing than the way I addressed him and I lean forward leaning my elbows on my desk, 'I don't mean to be rude but what are you doing here?' Again, he hesitates and shifts in the seat. I've made him uncomfortable and I realize he wasn't here for anything in particular. 'My son recently moved back home. Just last week, I'm used to being by myself but when there's someone in the house who doesn't talk much - makes you feel more lonely.' Cool story bro is all I can think and I resist the urge to roll my eyes. He looks down at the ground as if I'll embrace him or start another conversation with him. This guy pulled at my heartstrings, I'm not going to lie but I'm not here for friends. Especially ex alcoholics with family issues as high as a mountain. Clearing my throat, I blurt out something without even thinking, 'shall I crack out the whiskey then?' And literally, I throw my hand to my mouth and stifle a laugh. I watch him squirm in the chair and I inwardly cringe. 'I'm so sorry. I didn't mean- Patrick...' 'You make weird jokes if that was supposed to be funny.' He stands up and puts his hat back on his head, 'I get the message. You think of me as I think of myself. As my sons thinks of me.' The end part is barely audible but I catch it and it isn't difficult to see this guy needs a break in life. 'Alright,' I say and grab my bag, taking a look at the clock I have an hour before I'm deemed officially job threateningly late. 'Let's grab proper coffee then.' The small smile I see as I pass him says at I started the day off well. ~VD:T~ We sit opposite eachother in the small cafe down the street and weirdly, it's not in silence. He actually has a lot to say when he isn't confined to the small, familiar AA meeting place. In his comfort zone, the old guy is actually quite funny. 'So you're from England? How'd you get to Pittsburgh? It's where people are if they've ran away from home.' I put my coffee down and can see myself insulting him. This is treading on sensitive ground. 'I've eloped.' There's a pause and the grin that gradually makes its way onto my face tells him I'm joking and he shakes his head, 'take anything seriously Miss Drew?' 'Not really no, it's a bad habit hence why I'm deemed phone duty.' 'I thought you said your job was to handle the files.' He says curiously and gives me an authoritive look. It's lighthearted but I can tell he's genuinely wondering how much I know about him. 'For the record, I don't stalk you.' I say and just then the bell on the cafe rings and I see Patrick look up as if he's seen someone he knows. The look on his face tells me he's neither happy nor sad to see them. I turn around in my seat to see the broad, tall figure of none other than Tommy Conlon. He catches his fathers eye first and then mine as he halts in his movement to walk over here. I look back at Patrick who looks down and then back up at me. I can take my leave. I dig through my bag but before I can dig out any notes the space next to me is taken. The small sofa chair isn't that big and with the athletic size of the guy next to me, I might as well disappear into the corner. 'I was just leaving.' I tell him as he makes himself comfortable. He's wearing a worn black cap and a leather jacket, joggers and a toothpick in his mouth. This man just screams sex with the way he's panting, obviously been running and I can't help but lose my breath a little bit as his captivating grey eyes skim to mine for a brief moment before he stares right at his father and his look isn't friendly. 'I didn't know you were back on the dating scene Pop, gotta say, she's a little young.' Patrick almost chokes on his coffee and I splutter as well. Who the fuck does this guy think he is? I could tell he was a little rough around the edges but that was damn right rude and yet I can't help but think it's something I'd probably say. 'Excuse me?' I ask incredulously and turn to face him properly, my bag on my lap. He doesn't even meet my eyes and continues his glare at his dad before I get impatient of his ignorance and I poke him in the arm. I can tell by the brief contact he's very chisled underneath the baggy clothes. Slowly as if I wasn't there to begin with, he turns his head to shoot me a look to say 'what is this alien doing here?' 'That was rude.' I tell him bluntly and nod my head at him, 'now move yourself because I have work.' He might be the most good looking man I've seen in my youthful twenty-two years but I don't take rudeness lightly. I now know why I don't have any friends. He moves the toothpick around with his tongue in those lushious full lips of his and mutters something under his breath and yet he still makes no move to vacate the seat and allow me to exit. Patrick was sitting silently but then he perks up, 'Tommy, let her go, son.' His eyes meet mine again and I shoot him a look, he very deliberately and very slowly moves out of the sofa and as if he's turned into a gentleman moves his hands in a mocking gesture to the door. 'Alana,' he says under his breath but I catch it and move quickly out of the sofa. I throw a bill onto the table to cover my coffee and don't bother waving to Patrick who looks like he's about to say something before Tommy blocks my way once again. I sigh and roll my eyes and realize with the close proximity he's very hot (as in temperature) and tall. I have to look up to meet his eyes, like I said, brick wall of a man here. 'People are born assholes,' I say and meet his wavering gaze that I recognize as attempting to intimidate me, 'and some people try to be.' I catch very quickly I wonder if it's there at all a notion of a smirk and finally, he moves fully out of my way. As I reach the door, I take a look back at him to see he's stood there with a wondering look on his face. As if our first meeting wasn't bad enough, the second was most definitely worse. I called him an asshole. In front of his dad. He thought I was DATING HIS DAD. As I head back to work fashionably late, I want to bury myself under ground. This wasn't much of a chapter really - more like a filler but I wanted to just include a little bit from the film. I promise it will get better.[Chapter 4] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : sorry baby but I'm a bad boy, this a problem because you're a good girl : Chapter 4: Crushing on Tommy Riordan? 'You what?!' Kelsie spluttered and I made a face at her putting my own vodka shot down to wave my hands at her. 'Don't spill the vodka!' She takes a moment to establish herself and shifts on the stool in my kitchen. We always agree to meet at my place considering her dingy flat on the other side of town (the dodgy bit) isn't exactly friendly. Especially once we've downed a few shots and we decide to go wandering around, her area isn't the best place to do that. 'I called him an asshole.' I mumbled again and downed my shot before pouring another. My head was feeling lighter due to the three I've already downed and the liquid was beginning to make me buzz. Kelsie was still on her second and she looked as if she wanted to continue this conversation properly which I won't be able to do in a few more shots time. 'I can't believe you,' she laughed and gestured for me to pour her another, 'you call some guy you like an asshole. Good way to get him to like you.' 'He's rude,' I say kinda out of it that Kelsie has to grab the bottle herself to keep me from spilling any. I laugh weirdly and slump on my seat, 'I'm bored.' 'Let's go out,' she suggest and she grabs the vodka bottle and takes a swig before grabbing her jacket and walking out of my two floor apartment. I don't grab my jacket, purse or front door keys before I drunkenly stumble out to follow her. She's holding the only important thing right now - the alcohol. ~VD:T~ 'STOP CALLING... S-STOP CALLLLLING - I... I DON'T WANT TO THINK... I DON'T WANNA THINK ANYMORE!' Kelsie stumbles in front of me, the vodka tossed away at the last night club we stumbled into and puts her hands up towards the sky. 'I GOT MY DANCEFLOOR ON THE HEAD!' It takes a short moment for us to realize she got the lyrics jumbled and after a pause we both burst into hysterics. We're just outside the bus station that's a few blocks from my apartment. This is the signal of the end of our Monday nights, we will walk to the bus station and I'll wait until her bus arrives before I stumble back home and sleep for about an hour before I wake up and want to throw up. 'What's...' I hiccup slightly and grab the bus stop pole to keep myself from falling over. It's around midnight and the roads are silent. Well, they were before we sang Lady Gaga. Kelsie stops laughing to listen to what I'm about to say until she thinks of something else that seems more important to her right now. 'Oh! My bus.' We turn around to see the begrudging face of the bus driver who reluctantly stops next to us. The bus is almost empty and Kelsie steps on with great difficulty. For a moment I think the driver is going to wave us away but he doesn't and I bid my best friend goodnight before bursting into laughter again when she almost face plants the floor when the bus moves too quickly. I can feel my head spinning and I want to sit down but I tackle the internal struggle that is to walk ten minutes down a straight road. Just as I grasp my head to try and keep it steady, I hear a low mumble as if someone is shouting but they're far away. Their voice is muffled. '-llo! Bitch...deaf?!' All I heard was an insult and I whirl around to whoever called me a bitch only to come face to face with a very tall skinhead. His attire was typical of someone who looked like him, screwed up wifebeater as if he'd never owned an iron in his life, too low jeans and scragged leather shoes. He looked mid thirties and down right weird. 'Excuse me,' the alcohol in me said and held a finger up in front of me, 'I would like to go home,' hiccup , 'and die. Goodnight.' 'You drunk?' He said with an ugly smirk and my head was buzzing so much it was muffling the alarm bells that this guy in the middle of the night who'd already cursed at me could be ultimately dangerous. But I carried on walking and only spun around again when I felt a strong grip on my arm that forced me back. The Earth was spinning and I closed my eyes with a moan to keep from falling over. I wanted to sit down, right here in the concrete just until the houses around me stopped blurring with the stars but the man had his hands on my shoulders now, hard and painful. 'Let me go now,' I said quietly and still had my eyes shut. The world was still spinning that I more focused on my eyesight than the man in front of me. 'Perfect,' I heard him purr and I felt tugging on my cream long sleeved jumper. I wasn't dressed for a nightout, I was wearing skinny jeans and a sweater. 'Hey,' I slapped his hands away and went to move back but the man kept me in my place. Still, my brain wasn't quite registering what was going on but my subconcious was beginning tell me I had to get away and home very quickly. I just had to get this mans hands off of me. 'Don't fight darling.' He said and I felt tugging again until a brush of the freezing air caught my stomach and I snapped my eyes open, he hadn't quite taken my jumper off but he'd lifted it enough to see my white shirt underneath. Suddenly, I felt sick. Obviously the air sobered my up too quick but throwing up was the least of my problems because even though the Earth had stopped spinning, it occured to me my surroundings were very clear and that was the smirking skinhead was still trying to take my clothes off in the middle of the street. Bringing my hands up, I managed to force his arms away and I took a step back. The smirk on the mans face dripped off as he realized I was no longer out of it and he snarled but I managed to step back and away before managing to turn and begin to run. I obviously wasn't completely sober though because as soon as I was off I had to stop and the man came to stand in front of me again. I inwardly groaned, 'oh my God, go get a life.' 'What the fuck you saying to me, bitch?' He brought his hand up but I flinched just in time to miss it. Okay, this man was about to strike me and I widened my eyes in fear. No time for sarcasm right now. His hand came up again and he grabbed my jumper forcing me to him, his breath stunk of whiskey and I whimpered. 'Hey.' I breathed a sigh of relief when I realized that although this other voice was a man, I recognized it immediately. Tommy. It surprised me I could distinguish it so quickly after only hearing him speak like twice but I somehow felt really safe. Footsteps alerted me that I was still being held by this skinhead although the grip was loosened. 'Let her go,' Tommy said who was now stood next to me, his figure extremely close to me that I could tell me was wider and taller than this skinhead. 'Fuck you man, you can have her after. When I'm done with-' A blur in front of my eyes made me yelp in surprise and I was uncerimoniously thrown backward. I didn't hit the floor though and instead into someones arms. They were strong and sturdy and I wasn't stupid, I knew they were Tommy's but I played the damsel for just a moment longer. 'What the hell?' I breathed, putting on a good show until a smack on my backside told me I'd been dropped. Well fuck you very much, Tommy! I looked up to see Tommy landing another blow on the skinhead who clearly thought he'd try his luck to hurt him but the uppercut on his jaw made him scamper away before a very immature finger gesture in our direction. Tommy hovered over me and his grey eyes clear even in the nighttime looked concerned. Not sorry though. 'Are you okay?' His hand reached out for mine but I narrowed my eyes at him and got up myself having to steady myself before I spoke, 'you dropped me, fuckface.' His expression looked momentarily bewildered and he looked in the direction of where the skinhead ran off and back to me, 'but I saved you.' 'Still dropped me,' I said bluntly brushing myself off. 'Did he...' I looked up at Tommy who seemed to be scrutinizing me, 'did he hurt you? Or... tou-' I held my hands up with a quick affirmation that the man did not touch me or hurt me in any way. I made to walk away before stopping and looking back at him expectantly. 'Walk me home then. You dropped me, it's the least you can do.' He looked uncomfortable for a moment but began the slow walk home beside me. He was wearing jeans and a black short sleeved shirt under a grey hoodie. His dark brown hair fell on his forehead, he looked good as always. 'Where did you come from?' There was a silence but for some reason I didn't feel the need to ruin it by a sarcastic comment, I actually waited patiently for his response for once. 'Gym.' The wind picked up and I rubbed my arms for warmth - why didn't I bring a jacket with me again? Tommy stopped and I was about to turn around to ask him what he was doing and that I wasn't home yet when I saw him unzip the rest of his hoodie, I tried to drag my eyes away from his bulging arm muscles and the fact that his torso looks delightful in that tight T-shirt but I couldn't help but openly stare. He thrust the hoodie in my direction and then was about to drop it before I caught it, looking at him all confused. 'You might be hot but I'm not carrying this for you,' I held it back out to him, 'carry it yourself.' He rolled his eyes at me, 'put it on.' Oh. I did so without being told twice, I was freezing and I'm still a girl, I want to smell this ruggedly handsome man. Mmmm, he smells... manly. 'What are you doing outside all alone in the middle of the night with no jacket... no bag?' I shrugged and the hoodie fell heavilly around my shoulders. 'I was drunk.' By the close proximity of our walking together, our arms brushed now and again and I felt him stiffen although he recovered quickly. 'Do you... do you drink often?' 'Naah,' I said with a small laugh, 'only Monday nights really. And even sometimes that's rare if Kelsie has other plans.' I realized we're outside my apartment building and stop. Tommy looks at me and then at the building, gestures towards it, 'this you?' 'Yep,' I say and then literally face palm my forehead, 'shit!' 'Something wrong?' 'I forgot my keys!' I run to the door and buzz on my apartment as if someone is going to magically be inside and let me in. 'You live with someone?' 'No,' I groan and slump on the floor, nestling comfortably on the cold concrete step, 'I was just hoping God will give me a break.' I probably look a mess right now. And homeless. Tommy shifts his weight and takes a look around the empty street before sitting next to me on the step. He's sitting quite close and I'm tempted to rest my head on his shoulder. 'What're you gonna do?' Sleep, I think and close my eyes only to regret it when I don't want to open them again. I'm exhausted, have endured a slightly traumatic experience and was awoken from my drunken state way before schedule when I was in the comfort of my own home with paracetamol, water and a warm bed. I felt groggy, sick and... 'Are you sleeping?' I shoot my head up from his shoulder and quickly deny the question. 'You were.' There's a cheerful tone to his voice and I couldn't hide the smile I shoot him when he glances at me. There's a hint of a smile back and I yawn into my hand. 'I'll wait.' I say tiredly and rest my head on his shoulder again. 'Someone is bound to come in or out sooner or later. I have a spare key into my actual apartment under my doormat.' There's a pause and I make my head more comfortable on his broad shoulder, 'I probably shouldn't have told you that Tommy Conlon.' Before I can even register his chuckle, I'm a goner. ~VD:T~ Oh the sun. Bright, bright, bright. I roll over and hug my sheet to me in an attempt to deter the sick feeling longer so I can sleep more and then as if I've been shot, I shoot up in bed and take a look around. That's just the problem. I'm in bed. My warm, double bed under the covers. My jeans are still on but my shoes and my sweater is off and folded messily on my desk chair on the other side of the room. What the... But I'm off - towards the bathroom and see yesterdays meal in the toilet before flushing it away. I won't ever drink again, I tell myself like I tell myself every other time I'm in this position. I clean myself up at the sink before stumbling through my apartment to try and remember how the hell I even got inside. There's not a note or anything but there's a glass of water and a single white pill - my paracetamols - on the coffee table in the living room. Beside it is my phone with a text message. From Tommy. He must've put his number in my phone. 'Nice place you got. Give me a call when you're not throwing up to thank me.' There's no kiss or smiley face although that's not really like Tommy to do that. There is a little PS message though. 'It's Riordan. Not Conlon.' I put my phone down and try and hide the stupid grin that made its way onto my face. Wow, I'm crushing on the guy. I watched Warrior again with my friends. We started off in an argument because they favoured Brendan and then as soon as Tommy was injured and was said to be in custody after the fight, they balled their eyes out with one of my friends even saying, 'FUCK BRENDAN. PILAR AND TOMMY 4EVA.' I don't ship Pilar and Tommy. I ship Alana and Tommy. Talana. Anyway, hope you enjoy the chapter. I hope it's not like all the other fics out there - and thank you so much for the reviews so far guys! They mean a lot considering I'm only on the 4th chapter![Chapter 5] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : pardon me if I'm a cocky prick - now you wonder why he does it - all I want to see is a sky full of lighters : Chapter 5: You're Alana Drew, not Easilly Woo'd. I saw Patrick Conlon on Wednesday. His meeting was at 1 in the afternoon and conveniently that's when I decided to step out of my confined work space to talk to Kelsie. 'Alana,' he nodded his head in acknowledgement, a smile playing on his lips. Did he know what happened with his son? The rude yet chivalrous behaviour he showed not two days ago. Kelsie was stood on the other side of the hall talking to another AA member so I figured I could spare him a few minutes. 'Hey Patrick.' 'You can call me Paddy, y'know?' He says taking his worn hat off and smoothing down his hair, I eyed him carefully ensuring space was between us, he didn't intimidate me in the slightest but he was still a recovering alcoholic. 'So Patrick,' I said and caught his smile fall for a brief second, 'meeting soon, eh? All completed twelve steps and rearing to go?' I resisted the laugh that was about to burst through my lips and made a small, woe is me, sound before shifting my weight, uncomfortable underneath the heavy silence. Patrick cleared his throat and took a glance around the room before he leaned a little closer, I backed away slightly. 'Alana, did you wanna grab coffee after my meeting again?' Perve. Maybe his son was right. But wait a minute, my subconcious kicked her way through the defensive barrier in my mind, he said before he's lonely. Sighing I brushed a hand through my short hair, 'you know those things people have to earn money to buy coffee... it's called work.' 'Oh right, when do you get off?' That sentence sounded rude and I resisted the dirty thoughts to save my sanity, 'later. Look, Patrick, are you alright? Is it Tommy?' Why? Why for the love of God do I mention Tommy? It's just a reminder I still haven't called him yet. 'Tommy is fine,' he says quickly and studies me curiously, 'why?' 'No reason.' I say and catch Kelsie's eye across the room. She looks surprised I'm actually having a conversation with someone who isn't running for the hills due to a comment I've said and urges me to continue. Fuck you, Kelsie. 'Coffee sounds fine,' I blurt just to save any more questions about Tommy, 'meet you in an hour?' Patrick beams and putting his hat back on treads back into his meeting. I roll my eyes at his retreating back and puff out a breath. 'I didn't know you had a thing for... wait a minute, is that... That's the guy you're crushing on's dad!' Kelsie stage whispers and I smack her on the arm to calm her down. Ignoring everyones weirded gaze, she still has a stupid grin on her face. 'Good plan,' I catch her mocking eyes, 'get in with his dad. I'm impressed.' 'I don't think Tommy is too friendly with his dad,' I say quickly, 'to be honest, I don't think me having coffee with his dad is going to do anything but drive him away.' Kelsie looks around at the sound of her name and Ms Jamison is stood there pointing to the meeting that needs Kelsie's presence to start. 'You said he wants you to call right? So call.' Maybe I should, I dig my phone out of my jean pocket and check for messages. There is none. Figures. In the brief time I've known Tommy... Riordan. He doesn't seem the type of keep on for attention. You either like him and make the effort or don't. Simple as. I wait until Jamison walks away and I pop outside again without a jacket in the freezing air to make the call. He answers after a few rings. 'Yeah?' I recognize his phone voice. It's sexy phone voice. I have a sudden urge to change his name from Tommy on my phone to something more appropriate. Sex God. Oh, shut up Alana. 'Hey Tommy? It's Alana.' 'I know, I have your number saved.' I hear him drop something on the other line and he seems out of breath. There's a pause before there's quiet on the other line and he speaks again, 'took you long enough to call me. I'm still waiting.' Jerk. 'I'm not thanking you. You saved me, that I'm thankful for. Then you dropped me and broke into my apartment-' 'To put you to sleep. You were drooling on my shirt.' I drool? Do I drool? I seem to be more concerned about the fact whether I drooled on him or not that his chuckling on the other side of the line. My, it's a wonderful sound. 'So if you didn't call to thank you - why are you calling me?' Why am I calling him? I pause for a moment, 'I'm having coffee with your dad in an hour after his meeting. I was wondering if you wanna come.' The friendly tone he had before is gone and he grunts something inaudible. 'Why you so friendly with him?' Why am I so friendly with him? I shake my own conversation with myself in my head and focus more on the annoyed handsome man on the other end of the phone. 'I was only asking. I only accepted his offer because he brought up you...' 'What about me?' Shit, I need to stop this word vomit. 'Look, do you want to come or not? I'm not even sure if I'll go-' 'No, you should go. He...' he stops and sighs, 'he doesn't get much company anymore. But, can I see you afterward?' I scrunch my eyes and feel butterflies. Calm yourself. 'I figure you can treat me to a drink tonight to thank me instead.' Jerk. I'm working tonight but there's not a chance I'm skipping this opportunity. 'Fine. Well, you know where I live, you can meet me outside my place around seven?' 'Seven is good.' He doesn't say bye and hangs up instead. I'm noticing that's a common thing for Americans. I glance back inside and see Ms Jamison pop her head out of the meaning to glare at me. I put the phone back to my ear quickly and burst through the door as if I don't notice her and shout into my phone, 'yeah? Well you shouldn't have slept with her!' I pretend to hang up and catch her shocked expression. Tapping my phone, I stop and pretend to wipe my devastation from my face, 'boyfriend trou-' 'Cut it out, Lana. You don't have a man, get back to work.' She shuts the door behind her and leaves me stood there, flabberghasted at her audacity. I need a man. ~VD:T~ Coffee with Patrick is uneventful. He doesn't talk much about himself or his sons or even his meetings, he seems more interested in me. A conversation I also want to avoid. 'It was nice to see you,' he says as I go to get up and gather my jacket and bag. He seems so genuine, he's a nice old man with sky high problems but he's nice. I tend to avoid old people, they're too needy, dependant and irritable. But he's the exception. 'Yeah,' I shoot him a smile, 'I have to go, I have plans later tonight.' 'Are you...' he trails off and I put some money on the table waiting for him to finish, 'are you and Tommy together?' I can't help the laugh that escapes my lips. I stifle them when I see he's honestly curious and I shake my head. 'Not together, together. But we have spoken on several circumstances. He actually saved me Monday night from some drunk guy.' He bows his head and shakes it as if he's finding that hard to believe, 'is he who you're going out with later? Please excuse my prying.' I won't excuse it lightly, but I'll ignore it. 'Yes.' 'Be careful.' I want to ignore that too but I don't. I sigh and take my seat again, 'is he... is he dangerous?' He looks up with wide eyes and almost splutters, 'no! No no no. He's not... He isn't dangerous. He isn't the easiest person to communicate with. Enjoy your date.' Date. I don't say anything else and skip the goodbyes too as I get up and leave. I'm not sure I want to hear much else. It's obvious he isn't social. But he's talkative, well he is to me anyway. He's just a little bit of an asshole. But every rose has it's thorns. ~VD:T~ 'How'd you get into my building?' I ask, keeping myself between the wall and door to keep him from looking into my disarrayed apartment. I had trouble finding something to wear. I wasn't expecting him to knock on my front door and spent most of the evening checking if the buzzer worked to let someone into the building - nope, he got in somehow. 'Some lady was leaving. Let me in, can I come in?' He shifted his weight and his smirk and grey eyes almost had me fall over but I shook my head and slammed the door in his face. 'Two minutes,' I called from the other side bracing myself against the door. I look down at my outfit. Dark skinnies, black flat ankle boots and a white off the shoulder jumper I'll probably regret later considering just the draft outside had me shivering. But hey, I didn't fail to notice Tommy had a black leather jacket on. He's a tough guy, perhaps he'll give me his jacket and I can smell him again. Oh, shut UP Alana. You're not woo'd easilly, alright?! Grabbing my bag off the kitchen counter, I expertly opened the door and skidded out so he couldn't see into my apartment. He was leaning against the wall opposite, his hands deep in his jean pockets and he had a toothpick in his mouth. 'Ready?' I ask and lock my door behind me. When I turn around, he's already half way down the hall towards the building front door and I have to jog to keep in step with him. By the time we're near the bar, I'm out of breath and turn around to face him before we walk in. 'Wanna slow down? Or I might as well have taken a taxi here on my own.' I don't wait for him to respond and walk straight into the bar that I know a little too well thanks to Kelsie and my antics on Monday. We take a seat at the bar, the buzz of the friendly atmosphere making us comfortable and our drinks are ordered. I stick to light things first, white wines and lemonades before moving swiftly onto vodka and cokes. Tommy, like a man, orders the typical ciders. 'How was coffee with my dad?' He asks finally. I spin the ice around with my straw in my drink before answering him, 'he told me to be careful.' He nods his head and looks a little angry so I bow my head to catch his beautiful gaze, he follows my gaze up and I smile comfortingly, 'he meant well.' Tommy doesn't say anything else on the matter but it's okay because we focus more on eachother. 'So where are you from originally, here?' Nodding he takes a sip of his drink, 'Pittsburgh. I moved away for a while when I was twelve.' He takes a bigger gulp of his drink and I understand it's a sensitive subject for him. I move on quickly. 'So, what do you do?' He smiles slightly and turns to face me, his smile is contagious, 'what if I told you I'm a fighter?' I laugh once and lean back a little, 'I'd ask Rocky or Tekken?' He seems to be midly impressed and thinks for a moment, 'alright, I'm in training at the moment. For this tournament. Think MMA.' I was never into WWF or UFC as a kid, I mean, my idea of a fight is when another girl at school brought in Polly Pocket and said it was Barbie's sister. I can see he's obviously not fully comfortable talking about the subject but I think it's more to do with the attention he'll gain if this tournament is successful. 'You don't like attention much, do you?' 'Depends what kind.' He shoots back at me with a smirk and I bow my head to hide my face which I'm sure is red. I decide to crack a joke under the pressure as pure usual. 'So, MMA. Male Mating Academy?' Someone behind me clears their throat before Tommy can retort and I turn around when I see Tommy's eyes flash at whoever it is stood behind me. Patrick Conlon. 'Patrick...' I trailed off and saw the old man look innocently at us. I'm beginning to think this was a purposeful encounter. And Tommy doesn't look too pleased with it in the slightest. Shit...[Chapter 6] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : did you stand too close to the fire ~ like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone : Chapter 6: Patrick Conlon vs. Tommy Riordan The atmosphere in the bar suddenly grew very cold and I shivered from it. If Tommy noticed, he made no way of showing it, instead his grey orbs were fixated only on Patrick. Patrick still had on the Bambi eyes as if he'd done nothing wrong and had not in fact intruded on our evening and made Tommy quite stand-offish. He ordered an orange juice and because I'm fucking stupid, I had to say something, 'oh don't order the kiddie drinks because of me Mr Conlon, if you want that Jagermeister right there you...' His smile grew as Tommy's frown deepened. I realize I should've stopped way earlier but the joke was too tempting. 'I didn't know you two would be here.' Patrick attempted to console the situation but Tommy was having none of it. I was in between a father and son who walked on glass with eachother 99% of the time. 'I said training only, Pop.' Tommy muttered, his eyes still glaring at the man in front of him, 'training only.' Patrick was nodding before the last words were out of his sons mouth and I rubbed my arms now, the tension in the room dropping below 0. I knew I'd regret the jumper but I was hoping the jacket that sat on the back of Tommys stool would be around my shoulders by now. Perhaps he isn't one for showing affection in front of his dad. 'I know, Tommy. I honestly didn't know-' Tommy stood suddenly, his stool toppling over. The busy crowd glanced at us but it was probably nothing they hadn't seen before and blaming it on a drunk, they went back to their conversations surprisingly fast. 'Tommy,' I made an effort to calm him down before he looked about to explode and Patrick, sensing the timebomb stood as well ignoring the juice that was put in front of him. He tossed a bill on the bar and held his hands up. Tommy made a quick movement as if he was about to leave but I grabbed him. A really bad idea when you're balancing on a stool and a brick wall of a man decides to storm out. I fastened my grip on his white cotton T-Shirt that looked as if he'd squeezed into and made a little sound as I nearly fell completely off my chair. 'Wait.' And surprising both me and his dad, Tommy did. He stood still, he actually listened to someone other than himself. I didn't spare Patrick a glance as I got up off my seat, my hands still firmly on Tommy's abdomen, I could feel his harsh breathing as if he was trying to calm himself down and the only way he knew how to do that was to punch someone or walk away. And I was letting him do neither, this was a breakthrough for him. Standing right in front of him, his eyes were staring at the door behind me but I leaned real close and touched his cheek with a finger so his eyes slowly met mine. 'Let's go somewhere else, alright?' Moving my hands intimately up his stomach, over the plains of his muscles until they were planted on his chest. I had no idea what I was doing, I'd never had to calm down someone as built as Tommy. The people in work who got a little out of control once their daily dose of Jack was taken away were scrawny ass people with absolutely no upper body strength whatsoever - watching Kelsie calm down those people looks easy as pie. But whatever I was doing right now, touching Tommy in subtly intimate ways was calming him and his eyes went back to that normal grey colour, not the flash of red he had before. He nodded and grabbed his jacket and placed it around my shoulders - thank the heavens, he grabbed my hand and pulled me out of the bar. Patrick didn't say another word as we left, he was probably as dumbstruck as I was with the display I put on in there. Me and Tommy weren't even officially dating yet and I'd touched him more than I'd pet a new kitten. Don't get me wrong though, I inwardly smirked and noticed he hadn't let go of my hand, I'm absolutely loving it. I laughed so hard that I had to cover my mouth in fear the Italian pasta I'd just put in my mouth would spray all over my hot date in front of me. Tommy, without trying can be funny. I notice his sense of humour when it comes to jokes and sarcasm is a little dry but he has an opinionated mind although he doesn't let it on which is why when the skinny, big faked boobed blonde walked in this classy Italian restaurant on the posh side of my area, her mini skirt and boob tube didn't go unnoticed and before I could comment, Tommy rolled his eyes at her. I caught it immediately and had put my fork down to peer closer at him, 'what was that, Tommy Riordan?' I'd teased him and he looked at me innocently and confused at what I was talking about. Gesturing my head in the direction of the stereotypical slag who took a seat opposite an elderly man - can you SAY sugar daddy - I smirked at him. 'Did you roll your eyes at what my best friend is wearing tonight?' His face went from confused, to flustered and ended on defensive, 'you should tell your friend to dress right for a place like this.' I burst into laughter right then and Tommy caught on quick and I managed to get a chuckle out of him. He's a funny guy, he doesn't sweeten up his dates, I notice. He's a real gentleman, sure. But he doesn't kiss their asses - or he hasn't kissed mine.. I resist the unfortunately part. 'Although,' I take a sip of my cola, sobered up from when I was a litle buzzed before back in the bar, 'I can't say we look the part either.' His expression seems to register what I said but he doesn't comment and instead looks like he is thinking he wants to say something else. I cock my head, 'you alright?' 'Your accent is...' Ah yes. I smile a little and take another sip of my drink. 'England.' I recall this type of conversation with Patrick over coffee - Tommy is more reserved than his dad, seems to tread carefully over personal topics of conversation. Mind you, Patrick is still my exception of befriending old, alcoholic people. But tonight was weird and he almost ruined our evening. He's silent and I decide to take the reigns to let him know I'm okay with talking about it. With him, anyway. 'I moved to Pittsburgh two years ago. I went through multiple shop assistant jobs until I met Kelsie. She got me a job in AA.' 'Managing the phones?' His comment was serious but I caught the smile and matched it. Well, might as well be honest with him. 'My boss when she first met me found me quite funny. Thought I was a people person,' I scoffed a little, 'she was way wrong. I got demoted from desk to refreshments until I handed a water to a guy who was on this thousandth day and I made the stupid comment of, ''I snuck in a little vodka just for you.'' And that was the end of my people associating days.' Tommy's laugh was contagious. He didn't laugh often and it wasn't obnoxious, can't control yourself laughing. It was tame and controlled and manly almost as if he didn't want to laugh but couldn't help it and then didn't mind a select few hearing it on occasion. 'Don't you have to talk to people on the phone?' I held my drink at him and stated, 'ah. But according to my boss, it's the perfect plan. She will most likely fire me by the time the year is up anyway.' There was a pause as the waiter collected our food and he waited until he was gone to comment, 'Alana, I think you're pretty funny.' There was some sense of deeper meaning in that innocent compliment but I didn't ask for any more and just thanked him. It was a start. He bowed his head and then got up, 'shall we leave?' At my door, there was no awkward fumbling of keys or the stammer over conversation. I wasn't into that whole cliche of kissing at the door. And it looked like Tommy wasn't either. 'Tonight was nice. Didn't start off too well,' I remember Patrick and move on quickly, 'but the ending was good. I give his jacket back and grinned at him, 'thank you.' Tommy stands still with a small smile on his face and then surprises me with a hesitation - he doesn't want to kiss... Does he? I wouldn't mind but I wasn't expecting it.. I should've popped one of those mints- 'Thanks for... y'know...' he stops and reconsiders what he wants to say. Instead he stops and looks at me expectantly with a small grin, 'wanna finish that sentence, Lana? Lana? Lana... I like it! 'Alright, alright,' I laugh, 'thank you Tommy for saving me that night and gracefully dropping me on my ass and then breaking and entering my apartment to take advantage of me while I sleep.' He looks taken aback for a moment and the smile disappears before I realize I probably went too far. Seeming to read my thoughts, he nods once, 'you're right. You went too far.' I want to laugh at that - he read my mind. I stand on my tiptoes and kiss his cheek gingerly as if he's going to step away, he didn't. Our evening is officially over and I walk up the steps looking back once to catch his eye as he walks in the other direction. Tommy Riordan and Alana Drew. We have an incredible couple name. 'His dad was there?' Kelsie makes a face and I nod eagerly, 'yes! He claims he didn't know we would be there but I can't see him innocently walking into a bar alone to order orange juice, can you?' She pets her chin as she leans forward onto my desk, 'not to mention he's surrounded by all that temptation. He must've had a reason.' I glance outside and catch the subject of our conversation. 'Oh for fuck sake.' I run a hand through my hair and Kelsie follows my line of sight. 'That's weird,' she says and stands up, 'he doesn't have a meeting today.' 'Of course he doesn't,' I stand up too, 'don't worry. He's probably here to see me anyway. Do me a favour and throw your hands in the air if you see Jamison coming out of her office.' She mockingly salutes me and plants her perfect bottom on the chair again as I make my way over to Patrick Conlon. 'Morning Alana.' His blue eyes don't look phased in the slightest that I look pretty mad, 'you don't have a meeting today Patrick.' 'I came here to apologize. I shouldn't have interuppted your and Tommy's date. I could tell I wasn't wanted.' I didn't miss the training comment Tommy made and assumed that Patrick is training Tommy for that MMA competition he was talking about. Obviously, that's the end of their interaction. It was none of my business but it bothered me a little bit. 'No shit,' I mumbled under my breath but Patrick caught it with a sad smile, before he could leave though, I spoke up, 'look, Tommy and I are just friends but no offence, I'm not interested.' Patrick seems to think about something and takes his worn cap off his head, ' Miss Drew, I need to clarify that I am indeed old enough to be your father and would never...' I see where that conversation is going and hold my hands up, 'yeah alright, grandpa,' another joke that would've lost me a friend if Patrick wasn't so down to Earth, 'I get it. What were you doing there last night then?' 'I told you to be careful,' he said slowly and put his cap back on, 'I wanted to keep an eye on Tommy. Looks like I don't need to.' Damn straight. 'Why's that? Your overview analysation of me states I'm not a secret man, I'm not a rapist and not a terrorist?' Patrick fights a smile, 'because when he was as mad as he was last night, nobody has ever managed to calm him down.' Oh. Alrighty. I hope everyone liked this chapter - ticket sales for Big Bang are today and to get over my frustration that I cannot afford to go, I'm writing a chapter about my other boyfriend - Tom Hardy. Song is 21 Guns by Green Day. Oh! And that Derren Brown: Apocalypse is on tonight. I dunno if this is weird but I've always wanted, more than anything, to have one day caught in the middle of a zombie apocalypse just to see if my days of playing Resident Evil, Left 4 Dead and watching Walking Dead and 28 Weeks Later will pay off.[Chapter 7] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : i don't want the world to see me 'cause I don't think that they'd understand : Chapter 7: Lunch for two and eaten by one It didn't take long for me to work out which gym Tommy goes to - after he saved me, he'd told me he just came from there, in that kind of area there's only one and that's Colts Gym. A rough kinda place if you ask me but then again, if I'd seen Tommy at a club I'd probably be too intimidated by his muscles to chat him up and yet here I am, stood outside the gym he goes to holding a Starbucks and their famous chicken bento box. The place looked grimey from the outside but from the window I was staring through perhaps like a lemon you could see the typical new gym equipment that looked expensive. Throwing hell to the wind and holding my head up high, I walked through the door almost cussing the bell that jingled to notify the man at the desk of my arrival. He was a tanned Asian man, looked kinda skinny to be working in a gym, then again I probably look too sober and normal to work AA - oops, lucky I didn't say that in front of Jamison. 'Can I help you, Miss?' The Asian asked politely, his eyes brightening a little bit when he noticed I wasn't some bulky dude wanting to vent some anger into a punchbag. 'Is Tommy Conlon here?' My accent must've momentarily startled him because he paused, hesitated and then looked behind him through the glass. I tried to look as well but couldn't see much. The gym was practically bustling with hormonal, angry men and you could smell the sweat from here. Remind me why I decided to think that Tommy would work out in some uptown gym with benches to eat lunch and not a twenty-odd men throwing punches around you. Because Tommy isn't like that. The Asian looked amused by my uncomfortablness and to make it worse, instead of calling him to me, he pointed through the glass and said, 'he's right in there. You can go in.' I can't look intimidated by all these men, so I swallowed the pressing feeling in my stomach and shot the Asian man a sarcastic look, 'thank you.' If I thought outside was smelly then inside wasn't much better. The smell of wet towels, sweaty men and bruised leather filled my nostrils and I hugged the lunch and coffee to my chest tighter. If I didn't look out of place before then I looked out of place even more when the sniggering men caught sight of what I was holding. A chick in what seemed to be an all male gym holding Starbucks coffee and a posh bento lunchbox. Soon enough I spotted... Patrick? He was leaning on some ropes yelling to someone passionately. As if everything he was saying, he meant it and it would change someones life. I'd never seen him so.. eager before. Then I caught sight of who he was yelling at. Tommy was punching blows into a leather punchbag, each blow sending the bag backwards even more and it was swinging violently to the point it looked as if another blow would send it crashing to the ground. I'd seen Tommy send a punch before but this was new. He was throwing his entire body weight into each thrust of his shoulder, his back muscles in his black vest flexing and for a moment, I was stunned by the mans ferocity. It was absolutely mesmerizing... and hot as hell. Ignoring further sniggers from the men, I made a bee-line towards them. Patrick saw me first and his eyes widened when he saw me. 'Alana?' Standing right next to him, I nodded with a small smile. At the sound of my name, Tommy immediately stopped and looked in my direction having to catch the punchbag quickly before it knocked him on his ass. 'Lana, what're you doing here?' His tone wasn't unkind, more protective. Over what? His gym? He cast a quick look behind me and his shock faded to a scowl. I turned my head to see what had made him cross and saw a man leaning against the side of a ring, his arms crossed across his chest and he was smirking... at me. His hair was a mohawk and looked frankly quite stupid - he was tall and broad but not as much as Tommy and he had a fading black eye too. The man might as well have a placard around his neck that says, ' I HAVE MY HAIR IN THIS DUMB STYLE TO SCARE PEOPLE.' Turning back to Tommy who was unwrapping the bandages on his knuckles, I tried to catch his eye but he continued to focus solely on his hands. 'I brought lunch.' From the corner of my eye I saw Patrick look at me, to Tommy and then me again as if unsure to tell me to leave or to leave his son to do it on his own. I didn't realize my presence here would be such a problem. 'I can tell when I'm not wanted,' I said slowly and began to backpedle, I wasn't offended, more disappointed, 'I should've called first...' Tommy's head snapped up when he realized I was actually walking away and casting a quick look from his dad, he took a step forward so he was closer to me, he leaned down so only I could hear and said, 'I appreciate this, I do but...' I put my hand on his chest and smiled at him, 'seriously Tommy, it's okay. I didn't even think about how this would jeopardize your man-cred with some girl you're not even dating bringing you a stupid Starbucks lunch.' He must have thought I was being sarcastic because his eyes narrowed, 'you think I don't want you here because I care what these punks think of me?' Behind Tommy I could see Patrick walk towards a gym bag and take out a bottle of water, he's obviously trying not to listen but Tommy had raised his voice resulting in a few guys halting their work out to glance at us. 'No,' I said quickly, 'I mean, I probably wouldn't like it much if you strolled into my work with lunch when I was busy.' 'You're phone duty, when are you ever busy?' His tone had now taken on an impoliteness and I wasn't liking it. I raised my eyebrows and scoffed, 'yeah? Well you're not even getting paid for this. What makes you think all this unpaid training is going to pay off?' 'Oooh your girl got some spark, Rock.' Tommy's eyes flashed as we both turned to the other side of the gym to see mohawk man standing a little closer to us than before, he was still smirking but his elbows were resting on the ropes of the ring. Peering down at us... spooky. 'I'll leave,' I said quietly not wanting an audience for our little... discussion and just as I turned to leave, I heard that smug voice again. 'Wait baby, I was just getting turned on. You're a little spitfire - Austrailian too? I hear you girls can never keep your legs shut.' I stopped in my tracks and glared at the smirking imbecile who thought it would be funny to stand there and slander me when I was already having a bad day, my potential boyfriend-but-not-really rejected my lunch and now insulted my work - not that I like it to begin with but having to tell people you were demoted twice is embarassing alone. 'I wouldn't know, I'm British and we're classier than that. But while I go and sip tea may I suggest a hair salon? Or a hat shop?' His smirk looked as if I'd slapped it off and I made way to leave again before I heard Tommy yell but it was too late, I was grabbed by my forearm and I was getting a strange sense of deja vu. His face was threateningly close to mine that I could smell his peppery breath, from the corner of my eye I saw Tommy stalking towards him. I didn't need him to save me this time. Without thinking much about it, I raised my knee and hit home, the pained expression and the slacked grip told me I'd gotten the jackpot and as Mohawk Man fell to his knees, I unpeeled myself from his loosened grip, held up my hand to stop Tommy in his tracks ignoring the shocked yet impressed look on his face and said, 'for the record, this is very good coffee and this bento box cost a lot of money I can't afford so I'm going home to eat it... alone.' I shot him a filthy look and before I reached the door, I turned again to clip back, 'and if you must know, I'm a very busy and important woman!' ~VD:T~ The next day at work, I realized just how right Tommy was. I was bored out of my brain and found dull interest in the way my electric pencil sharpener would only sharpen for four precise seconds before you had to remove and start again. There'd been no word from Patrick or Tommy but I'd had fun in telling Kelsie the brunt of my afternoon yesterday. It was only when I was telling her did I realize it probably wasn't a good idea to go barging into his environment with a fucking Starbucks and expect him to eat lunch with me in front of all those guys but he could've been a little nicer about it. As for Mohawk Man, I'd be happy to confront him again about his absurd comments and crude stereotypes. I don't think Austrailian women are like that at all. However, next time I decide to knee slam his prize jewels I'd prefer it wasn't in front of Tommy - I don't want him thinking I'm some violent woman along with being rude and inappropriately sarcastic. 'Alana, there's a guy for you in the lobby.' I nodded my head towards the young intern and headed towards the room where most AA clients decide to meet and socialize before heading into their meeting. Assuming it was Patrick, it hit me like a ton of bricks when I saw Tommy with a Krispy Kreme bag, smiling shyly. 'Tommy - what are you doing here?' I approached him quite stunned by this gesture assuming the doughnuts and coffee were for us and not someone else. 'Yesterday,' he said simply and I nodded in understanding. He wasn't going to apologize, he wasn't like that, he wasn't going to say anything else on the way he acted, this itself was his apology. 'Let me grab my coat,' I grabbed my black jacket off my seat and made my way back to Tommy who was clad in dark jeans and a grey cotton T-Shirt under a black jacket, the frosty air was reminding my that bonfire night is just days away. We didn't walk far and instead settled for a bench in a nearby park - the air was chilly but the coffee warmed us up, I'd noticed Tommy is more a sugary person anyway, he'd prefer doughnuts over chicken ceasar salad anyday. 'Mad Dog was pretty pissed yesterday.' I sipped my coffee and furrowed my brows, 'excuse me?' 'Mad Dog,' Tommy told me, 'he's the one who you...' he cleared his throat hoping I would catch on and even though I did, watching him struggle was entertaining. I feigned confusion and shook my head. He looked at me helplessly and kind of shook his shoulders around as if preparing for an arm wrestle, 'you hit him in the balls.' 'Oh,' I said unable to resist the knowing grin which made Tommy chuckle, 'well, he was rude to Austrailians.' 'And you.' I looked up at him and saw him look down at his iced doughnut. I didn't say anything else but felt the butterflies flutter around my stomach not a care in the world I'm trying to keep it cool in front of this guy. After twenty minutes, the food was gone and our coffee's were drained and again, the air was beginning to bite through my jacket. My teeth chattered and I laughed softly, 'it's weird, I like the cold yet it's the worst feeling in the world when you're freezing.' Tommy moved from his seat from opposite to me to take the remaining space on the bench beside me, he didn't make another move leaving it up to me to decide whether I wanted to continue our embrace. Blaming the cold and the fact I just wasn't myself whenever this guy was around, I slowly got closer and closer until I could wrap my arms around his broad shoulder and tucking my legs underneath me, I was hugging his arm to my chest. Strangely, he was warm and my teeth stopped chattering. I rested my head on the top of his shoulder between it and his neck and realized that this was the BEST FEELING EVER! I felt like a teenager again. Not twenty two years of age and just beginning the first of a potential serious relationship. I've had guys in the past. None that have made me feel the way I feel around Tommy. Soon, Tommy's other arm came up to caress my cheek and I closed my eyes tightly realizing that something could happen right if I lift my head. We could kiss. Hesitantly, I looked up and saw his grey eyes look at me expectantly, he was expecting me to look away, not to close the distance between us and take his full lips between mine. Which is why it took him a millisecond longer than I would've liked for him to respond but soon, we were chastely kissing, not obnoxiously making out on a frosty morning in November in a park. And although some will say Tommy is anything but romantic, I couldn't have asked for a more perfectly romantic moment to share my first kiss with him. Sorry it took so long guys. How was everyones Halloween? Song is Iris by Goo Goo Dolls. Also - bonfire night on Monday, please stay safe ladies and gentleman. There's already been a boy over here in the UK that has his face damaged. OH! Also, my thoughts go out to the people who have been affected by Hurricane Sandy, RIP to the deceased and to those who are reading my story and have been affected, my thoughts, prayers, hopes and wishes go out to each and every single one of you.[Chapter 8] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : i'd like to get to know you in some kind of way, some kind of trouble in some kind of way : Chapter 8: Movie & Chinese food, no thank you. 'Alana, do you have a moment?' Jamison looked impatient with the way she was tapping her foot, I smoothed down my jeans and approached her by the door. She looked out the door and I followed her gaze to Patrick who was sat in one of his meetings with Kelsie. 'Do you know that man?' Nodding, not sure where she was going with this I crossed my arms over my chest, 'Patrick Conlon.' 'He seems to like you. He complimented your... people skills to one of my colleagues.' He did? Jamison met my gaze, 'do you have meetings with him outside of AA?' 'Yeah,' I scoffed, 'we meet up, hook up, you know the drill.' She didn't catch the funny side and I fought the urge to roll my eyes, clearing my throat I continued. 'Ma'am, we had coffee. Twice.' Raising a severely plucked brow it looked starving, she mumbled something. 'You're his mentor.' If I'd been in the middle of a drink, she'd be drenched. 'Excuse me? Ms Jamison...' WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT? 'Tell me Miss Drew, do you like working the phones?' Her tone was cocky and I could sense the trick question a mile off. Reverse psychology - fuck you Jamison. 'No.' She turned once more to Patrick and gestured towards him, 'mentoring starts as of immediately. Kelsie can teach you as you go along. It's a temporary placement - I never know with you. As for the phones, I'm sure one of our interns can handle it, they are only phones after all.' With a flick of her hair, the bitch walked off and left me stood there, wondering what in the hell I was going to do now. Mentoring Tommy's drunk father in AA when he already has a rocky relationship with him not to mention he seems to be put off by the very idea of me and his father associating. 'Patrick!' I called when his meeting was over. Again he was wearing that same cap, 'that cap has moth holes in it.' I began to laugh but saw the serious look in his eyes. O...kay then. 'Alana.' He greeted politely and looked a little awkward. Me and him hadn't spoken after he told me about how I'd calmed down Tommy in the bar. The altercation wasn't unpleasant in the least but I could see why he'd still be a little uncomfortable. I was too. 'I've been given a temporary position here.' He looked genuinely interested and I glanced at the other AA members who seemed to be passing too slowly. 'I... you know what? Wanna get some coffee?' ~VD:T~ 'So what does that mean?' 'I monitor you.' Patrick took a sip of his coffee while mine went untouched. He seemed just as confused about this as I did but he wasn't rude about it. 'Monitor me? I'm coming up to almost a thousand days soberity, I don't think I need monitoring. I'm flattered though.' I tapped my fingers on the table, this wasn't going particularly well. I wasn't expecting a huge happy jump in the air of joy but I wasn't expecting him to be so put off. Although something told me he was more offended by the fact he had to still be monitored rather than it was me doing the whole mentor thing. 'You hate people.' I had to laugh at that and he shared a smile finally. I shook my head, 'I don't hate people.' 'Alright, you're bad with people.' 'It doesn't matter,' I offered a genuine smile for once, 'I don't have to be good with people. I have to be good with mentoring you.' 'What does a mentor do?' He asked and I paused. I wanted to laugh really but that would just prove that I honestly had no idea. Kelsie did mentoring for some select individuals but she never had to do much. She used to say it's like counselling only less professional. You sit and listen whenever your client feels the need to resort back to alcohol, you monitor how well they're doing, their sober days, etc. 'Basically, I do exactly what I do right now. Sit with you and listen.' He seemed momentarily shocked by this as if nobody had said they'd listen to him before. 'Okay.' 'Yeah?' I grinned and felt a surge of determination inside, 'let's tackle this together then.' ~VD:T~ Tommy had called several times in the three days since we kissed in the park. I didn't expect him to, especially since he always came across as the kind of guy who wouldn't. We hadn't arranged anything but I felt the need to tell him about Patrick and my new position at work. I didn't want this creeping up on us at some unfortunate time in our... whatever we were. I couldn't officially claim us as a couple because we'd kissed once, been on one proper date and shared food twice. As if Krispy Kreme doughnuts even count though. 'What're you doing tonight?' 'Nothin'.' Tommy said and I sensed a small smile, 'why? You wanna do somethin'?' Tommy had told me the other day that he'd be heading off somewhere over the weekend due to some publicity thing - part of the tournament or something but he would back the following Monday for a week before he'd be flying off to Atlantic City. There'd been no further discussion on the matter and Tommy and I both seemed content in keeping it that way. 'Mhmm,' I tucked the phone between my ear and shoulder and held up a few newspaper articles where I'd circled job offers. I would never apply for them but the fact they were there made me feel better about my life if someone happened to visit and see them. As if anyone but Kelsie came to my apartment. 'Dinner?' A traditional dinner date didn't suit Tommy and to be honest, it didn't suit me either. Banqueting at fancy restaurants never appealed to me when I thought about going there with a guy I was potentially dating. I cast a look around my apartment and saw it was relatively clean. I had an idea. 'What about my place? Movie and Chinese food? You can drive back to yours later.' I made the last part clear so that he didn't come round expecting anything. I wasn't a prude but I wasn't the kind of person who fell into bed after a guy gave me butterflies even if they were as good looking as Tommy... Riordan. 'Sounds good. See you at 7?' 'See you at 7.' 7. Gave me two hours to clean, tidy the apartment and myself and settle on something comfy and movie-comfy to wear that wasn't just unflattering sweats but that looked like I hadn't made much effort either. After showering and giving the living room and kitchen of my apartment a quick hoover and polish, I settled for black leggings with wooly socks and an off the shoulder white see-through long shirt with a black tank underneath. I usually wore this when I visited Kelsie sometimes but he didn't have to know that. He just had to know that this was me with minimum effort even if I did spend 45 minutes on choosing the outfit not to mention washing and blow drying my short dark hair. At 7.12 Tommy knocked on the door again and I was beginning to feel like the woman who he claimed kept letting him in had an obsession with him or something. 'Perhaps she fancies you. She thinks she's letting you in so you'll visit her afterwards.' I said as I let him in and made my way over to the TV. I sat crossed legged in front of it and the cupboard that contained my DVD's while he casually put his jacket over the back of the couch and then sat down. He looked out of place in my apartment - everything was kinda organized due to my OCD. Not to mention that most things in my place was white or beige. It's been a pet peeve of mine since I was young to have mismatched furniture and home decor. Call me crazy. 'Alright, movie or food first?' I took a look at him, he was watching me closely and I felt weird. Good weird. 'Or both?' He nodded and I grabbed the menu off the counter before settling beside him, enjoying his warmth and the comfortable presence he had. He may look out of place but he certainly didn't feel it. With the right side of my body pressed against his left so we could both study the menu, it just felt right. We chose carefully and I noticed that we both tended to eat a lot. I wasn't overweight but not insanely skinny either. I was average - I like to eat, sue me. It took every bit of willpower to climb back off the couch and settle back in front of the DVD's. I wanted to stay with him sharing his warmth. I opened the cupboard and then lay on my front as I began humming to myself. 'You don't seem the kind to watch something like 10 Things I Hate About You so...' I smirked and pulled a cover out, 'Titanic?' Tommy couldn't hide the smile that graced his beautiful face and I took delight in the fact that it was caused because of me. I felt giddy inside - that never happened. I threw it back in the cupboard with a laugh and scoured through them again, I could hear him moving and he was soon sitting with one knee up and the other leg stretched in front of him, his arms resting on his knee as he sat next to me and looked for himself. 'West Side Story.' I said and caught his confused look, 'it's got fighting in it.' This perked his attention and I watched his eyes glide over the case before he caught on. 'It's a musical, isn't it?' 'I think so,' I shrugged innocently, 'I don't think I've seen it.' Throwing it back, I pulled out another, 'oh I bet this ones your guilty pleasure,' I tossed him Pretty in Pink and watched him throw it back at me gently so it landed on my back. I was having a laugh now and was more interested in making him laugh than actually picking out a movie. 'Oh no wait,' the Covenant now sat in front on him and he looked up at me with those amazing grey eyes as if I was taking the absolute piss which I absolutely was. 'Oh yeah?' The smirk on his face could've made me die right there. He nudged me out the way and I rolled over to my back as I heard him shuffle through my DVDs until he found one that made him chuckle. I wasn't ashamed of any of my DVDs except... wait... Before I could even sit up, a case cover was hovering over my face and I laughed in embarassment. Tommy's face was above mine now and I covered my face as I could feel my cheeks heating up. 'It was a gift...' I mumbled and felt my hands getting peeled away. I looked up into Tommy's eyes my laughter suddenly dying down as he moved his body so that one knee was either side of my hips and he was technically straddling me. He didn't put any weight whatsoever on me until he leaned down and his torso pressed into mine sensually. It was an intimate moment for both of us and I held my breath anticipating his next move. I wanted to kiss him and the way his eyes kept looking at my lips, I took the initiative. Leaning up, my hands were still above my head being pinned by his but as I kissed him, he let go of my hands allowing both of us to explore. I put my hands on his neck and shoulder as he quite adorably hovered around my neck before he must've grown more brass and soon made his way down my sides to settle at my hips. For the first time, our tongues were able to delve into eachothers mouths and I could feel my stomach doing flips that it was almost distracting. The buzzer broke up apart - our breaths jagged and uneven. He didn't move right away and he looked a little unsteady. He looked as if he went through girls as if they were turkey strips in a buffet but this seemed new to him. I smiled at him to let him know everything he did was perfectly okay and he offered a small one back. The buzzer sounded again and this time, Tommy got up and allowed me to get up. Suddenly, I was no longer interested in movie or food and more concerned in how I was so unable to control my actions around this man. This was going to end one of two ways. Uncomfortable silence throughout and a chaste, awkward kiss as he leaves or I most certainly wasn't going to bed alone tonight. Hellooooo, sorry it's been so long. Anyway, I'm not sure if the first SPARTA event is in Atlantic City, I think it is. I'm not sure. Also, I was thinking about the outcome of this story. Tommy in the movie (spoiler) is undoubtedly hellbent on vendetta's. Getting back at his brother and his dad and there's no doubt about it that the man is driven by pure anger and the need to destroy eveything in his path. There's no way I can incorporate this kind of cute personality that results in Tommy getting a girlfriend if he is still that kind of fighter. Therefore - this story is going to skip a bit. I won't tell you how or what is going to happen but I'm warning you now, in a few chapters time, there will be a time lapse where the time frame will skip ahead perhaps a few months? If this is a huge problem, please don't hesitate to review and let me know - anyway, hope you enjoy the chapter guys. Oh song is One Engine by the Decemberists. It's from the Hunger Games but it seems appropriate for Tommy's character.[Chapter 9] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : i'm falling for a monster - somehow he's scaring me to death : Chapter 9 - Sex and Secrets I don't think either of us were interested in the food or the movie we'd settled on watching either. It wasn't one of my DVDs, it was on the television and it wasn't particularly exciting considering it was still only 8PM. Not being able to help myself, I kept taking glances at Tommy who sat beside me and at the spot on my floor where we'd started something... it was like opening a door to something new and before it closed again, we wanted to take a peek inside. Which is why I forgot all about the real reason I'd brought Tommy here in the first place and why our discarded chinese food was sitting on my coffee table. I was on Tommy's lap, straddling his legs as we fought for dominance in eachothers mouths. His full lips were killing me and before I knew it, fingers were at the hem of my blouse slowly lifting it. Tommy removed his lips from mine and settled for gently nipping and sucking a certain spot on my neck, he was still lifting my blouse agonizingly slowly until I just said, 'it's okay,' and then it was like woop, where'd it go? When I first met Tommy I didn't think he'd be the type of guy I'd sleep with. I had a habit of sleeping with those who were too nervous to do much - but Tommy wasn't nervous, he was only seeming to make sure now and again that what I was doing right now wasn't a mistake - hell no it's not. Me in my sky blue bra and leggings and Tommy in just his jeans were now on my sheets in my bedroom and we weren't planning on stopping. I didn't know if we were even properly dating to be honest. You're such a slut. Tommy managed to shut that nagging voice in my mind up when his tongue made it's way to my chest and then, I just gave in. Like I'd mentioned before, I was never interested in wrestling. If I thought Tommy looked hot throwing punches in a gym though, he was certainly irresistable when it came to him in bed. He wasn't primal, he wasn't an animal and he only went rough when he knew I was alright with it, most of it was just experimental territory. Both of us testing eachother to see how far we'd let our limits go, touching eachother because it was all so new - Tommy in a nutshell was just fantastic in bed. End of. ~VD:T~ 'I'm a slut.' 'No you're not.' Kelsie seemed annoyed I'd called her so early in the morning. She was probably due for work this early Saturday morning and instead of letting her get her 10 minutes of snoozey time, I'd called her at 6.30 to self depricate myself. 'I am,' I hushed into the phone as I made a cup of tea for myself, as I waited I went upstairs and poked my head around the bedroom door to see Tommy laying on his side, his back to me, the tattoos were rippling every time he breathed - can you only imagine what they look like when they're rippling when he's engaging in other things? I don't have to. 'Alana, you're twenty two, haven't got laid in ages let alone even went out with a guy - I mean, have you even dated since you got to America?' 'No,' I groaned and rolled my eyes before heading back to the kitchen, 'not the point. I wasn't even planning on staying here long. You know that.' 'But you did,' she said distracted, she was probably getting dressed and the, 'fucking belt,' confirmed it as she recovered and continued the conversation, 'you can't run away from home forever but enjoy it here. With Tommy.' 'Tommy and I aren't-' 'Aren't?' I turned around to quickly that I almost spilled my tea all down the front of my long sleeved night shirt that went down to my mid-thighs. I'd expected to look more decent before Tommy woke up but he was only clad in his jeans again - only he worked the morning after look better than I did. 'Kelise I have to go,' I muttered and hung up before I could listen to her protests. 'Tommy, morning. Tea?' He shook his head and I noticed he seemed back to his stand offish ways again. Wow, was last night really just that? A one night stand? I mean, Tommy came across as someone who didn't do the dating scene, perhaps he tried it, liked it and then I gave him exactly what he wanted out of it - sex and now he can go on his way. Realizing this was probably true, I turned back around again to hide the shame on my face. 'Erm - do you...' I paused and although I didn't feel like crying because I was sad this thing whatever me and Tommy had was over, I had a lump in my throat because I was right. I'm a slut. 'Last night wasn't a mistake, Lana. If that's what you're embarassed about.' I forgot it's like he can read my mind. Turning around I forced a smile, 'embarassed? No way - you should be,' I held up a pinky finger with a laugh but noticed his scowl and quickly mumbled a 'kidding' under my breath. 'I just...' I was doing this a lot. Stammering. 'I wanna let you know that last night doesn't happen often for me.' 'Sex?' His smirk caught me off guard and I took a breath. 'Not just that - sex after knowing a guy for about a week and a half.' Tommy walked slowly towards me and braced both of his arms to the counter pinning me to it, he bent his neck so his eyes were level with mine and I held my tea to my chest as a kind of barrier. 'I never said you did and for the record, you aint no slut. How can you be a slut when you sleep with someone you're datin'?' Hold up. We're dating? 'We're dating?' Tommy looked to the side of me before looking back at me a little lost, 'isn't that what we're doing?' Relief flooded by entire body and I had to lean a little backwards on the counter to stop myself from falling down. Thank God - he's a grown up. And interested in dating me. I fought the urge to make a joke about him being my boyfriend and instead pecked him on the lips tentively before he eventually deepened it. This was confirmation enough that what we had most definitely wasn't just some one night stand. A knock on my door interuppted us and I cocked my head around Tommy to glance at the door. Tommy looked behind him as well before lifting his watch up, 'it's like 6.30...' I didn't move and Tommy looked at me weirdly. 'I never get visitors.' I said bluntly and he could tell I was a little hesitant about answering it. He rested his forehead on mine for a moment before making his way to the door and opening it a little. Tommy didn't speak but I could hear a startled gasp from the other side of the door. Making my way over, I pressed myself against Tommy's side and one of his arms went around my waist. Mrs Shraplot. I wanted to laugh hysterically right then and there and a little snigger errupted that Tommy heard before I raised my head once more to face the elderly woman who had a curious but overall pissed off look on her face. 'Miss Drew, I would like to let you know beforehand that I'll be making a formal complaint to the building supervisor this afternoon.' 'Oh really?' I asked not bothered in the least and I let a grin slip, 'about that baby next door who just cries and cries, yeah, tell him from me that the baby's gotta go.' Mrs Shraplot wasn't impressed and obviously not interested in joking right now. Tommy's grip tightening letting me know he was finding this thoroughly enjoyable. 'Alana-' 'It's Miss Drew to you,' I shot back at her with such a mesmerizing smile I thought she was going to slap it off. 'Last nights ruckus was intollerable.' She had her nightgown on and she looked tired and I for a split second felt a little guilty. Me and Tommy weren't quiet last night that's for sure, I probably kept her up. Just as I was about to genuinely apologize though, she held her hand up. 'I think I've heard enough of your voice from last night, Miss Drew,' she cast her eyes towards Tommy, 'young man, the words you said last night are sin.' With that, she walked off and Tommy shut the door. It took a whole three seconds to ensure she'd gone before we burst out laughing. I wasn't sorry anymore. Last night was totally worth it. 'My Gosh - I hope your dad doesn't get tired of me talking a lot though otherwise this whole mentoring thing isn't gonna work.' Tommy recovered quickly and as I turned around to see what had made him halt, the look on his face told me that I'd let it slip. The reason I had called him over in the first place. 'You're... doin' what?' Shit. I ran a hand through my hair and looked away from him. This would probably end in an argument and after such a lovely night and amusing morning, I didn't want this to be over so quickly. 'Lana.' I met his gaze again and what made it worse were his eyes were hopeful - hopeful I was joking. He was hopeful that I wasn't mentoring his dad. 'I've been asked to mentor your dad - it's not a lot of work. I just have to sit with him... and listen to what he has to say!' Tommy was talking over me before I'd even finished. He was pacing and I could feel this anger coming off of him. Because I was the reason this time, I don't think it would be wise to try and calm him down. However, I didn't want a hole in my wall. 'Tommy-' 'Lana, the guy... he aint whatcha think.' I crossed my arms across my chest now and leaned back on the kitchen counter, 'enlighten me then Tommy. What's bad about him? He's been going to AA for almost three and a half years - he's really changed.' 'You think he was just a drunk?!' Tommy was beginning to frighten me now, he hadn't raised his voice to me in this way before. At the gym, it was a simple fall-out, this was becoming a full blown argument. There was silence, 'Tommy, me and you don't really know eachother, do we?' He didn't say anything just proving to me that my intention of keeping personal things hidden was just another mistake. 'Alright,' I said and moved into the living room, he followed me and at first didn't move. But I was being patient with him. When he was ready, he can move to sit down beside me and before long but what felt like hours, he finally and slowly made his way over but he didn't sit beside me. He took the armchair across from me. 'I moved to Pittsburgh two years ago but you knew that. My family live in London, England. I haven't spoken to them since I've moved here.' Tommy's piercing gaze didn't leave mine but nor did that everpresent frown on his face. He was still angry but he was listening and that was a start. If I want him to open up, I have to do the same. I wasn't going into the gory details but I figured a brief overview wouldn't kill us. 'My younger sister got involved with some bad people and my dad had left us and my mum found solace in going out with guys every night. As soon as I finished my first course in University, I moved here.' Tommy and I didn't say anything for a while but I allowed it - welcomed it. After telling someone other than Kelsie, it felt liberating but like I was betraying myself for allowing someone else who already made me feel out of control the power to know something that personal about me. 'Pop beat my ma.' Those four words bounced off the walls until it settled. My face didn't change to let him know the words had shocked me although they had. I could tell there was more to this story but at the moment, that was the end of his dad. 'I was in the army for a while. I still get nightmares - my best friend died. Friendly fire.' He said it all so casually, it was like he was reading a shopping list but the look on his face told me that he felt the same way I did. He was scared at allowing someone else to have this much over him. The permission to judge you on something you can't control, the permission to throw it in your face during an argument. 'Tommy - my job is to talk about Patrick Conlon's drinking. To him I'm Miss Drew, his mentor. Not his sons girlfriend. Anything he says stays within my line of work.' I felt like I was explaining to a child how to do a jigsaw puzzle but soon, Tommy's jaw set and his eyes looked away and I could tell I was about to lose him to his anger again so not giving it a chance to blossom, I stood up, crossed the room and knelt in front of him. He didn't look at me but he was shaking - he wanted to hit something again. Grabbing his head, I rested my forehead against his using his method before when we were in the kitchen as a way of comforting him. 'This this we got - it's new. It's weird but it's nice, okay? Don't let your dad ruin something for you again.' This seemed to work and he pressed a kiss against my lips before muttering an, 'okay.' YOYOYO I thought I'd update again because I'm in a good mood and I felt motivated - alright I think the next chapter will be the beginning of what is going to cause the timeframe to jump a little - thank you to those who said they're okay with it - much appreciated. I will update again soon. Song is Black Heart by Stooshe - I think it goes well with this story altogether and although Tommy doesn't frighten Lana all the time, it's kinda appropriate.[Chapter 10] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : i've got real big plans & such bad thoughts - accidents bring the house down : Chapter 10 - I'm jealous and Tommy's lying. 'You home now?' Tommy sounded tired, his trip over the weekend had obviously been long and Tommy admitted to me himself he hated attention, let alone go on a trip with his dad to publicize himself in a tournament. 'Almost. Why, you wanna go somewhere?' I pulled into my driveway thankful to be home from work and cut the ignition, not getting out the car yet. 'Nah, you're tired, I'm tired. We can go out tomorrow.' 'Where?' Before Tommy left for the weekend we hadn't slept together but decided more on going out on dates. Some were dinner dates in restaurants, some were movie nights in my apartment (where we actually focused on the film this time) and others were just strolling around town. 'It's bonfire night. There's gonna be a firework show near mine, you wanna go?' 'You wanna get out the car, babe?' For a moment I actually checked to see if the guy on the line was Tommy. Then for the first time, I noticed a figure sat on my doorstep. Tommy's face was barely visible due to the pitch black of the night but the light above the door illuminated him enough so that the smirk on his face was unmissable. 'Tommy?' I asked with a small smile, I couldn't quite believe he was here. I'd missed him over the weekend. He wasn't allowed to call me and our frequent conversations were almost tradition now. I got out the car and crossed the small carpark towards him where he instantly enveloped me in a hug. I'd forgotten how cold I was but Tommy just smelled so damn good and it felt nice to be hugged by someone who could possibly crush you - it was like sitting too close to a fire. It was so damn warm but leaning too close could burn you. 'You've been gone two days, I think you missed me more than I missed you.' I commented jokingly as he finally released me. 'Bein' around Pop and strangers who just want your autograph di'nt go well.' I nodded in understanding. My first mentoring session with Patrick wasn't entirely successful - he was too used to talking to me as if his drinking problem doesn't exist. It was only when he mentioned Tommy and I'd smiled involuntarily that Patrick realized that drink ruined the relationship he had with his son. As we both went into my apartment, I wasn't prepared for company and flushed at the mess. Papers were scattered on desks and I'd been running late this morning meaning I had been fixing a cup of tea while calling Kelsie while getting dressed resulting in various items of clothing on the floor, a discarded cup of tea and packet of biscuits still lay on the coffee table and shit yep, that was a bra hanging off one of the kitchen stools. Tommy didn't waste time chuckling under his breath and picking it up, 'I think I recognize this one.' 'I was wearing that one when I was a little drunk and you took me home that night,' I said as serious as I could muster, 'meaning you looked under my shirt, didn't you? Pervert.' Tommy put the bra down and looked momentarily flustered. He opened his mouth to say something but my smile slipped and he sighed, running a hand through his dark hair, 'don't do that.' 'You didn't deny it though.' 'I didn't take advantage of you. I wouldn't do that.' He said with a smile but with genuinity. Dumping my bag on the kitchen table, Tommy shurgged off his jacket and took a seat on my couch as if he lived here. 'We arranged to go out tomorrow.' To anyone else, that would have come across as a hint to leave but my boyfriend just shrugged and turned the TV on. I rolled my eyes and started taking off my jacket and jumper, 'I'm taking a shower, just make yourself at home by all means. Don't mind me, I'll just forget you're here,' I was still mumbling when I got into my bedroom. I half expected Tommy to interuppt my shower but he remained a gentleman and obviously didn't want to test any boundaries yet. I can't say I would've minded but I'm tired and shower sex is, well from the look on the movies it just looks like dangerous work. It was when I'd changed into leggings and a comfy jumper that I realized I had a message on my answering machine. Pressing the button, I continued towel drying my hair until the voice made me stop and feel like someone had kicked my stomach. 'Alana? I don't know if I have the right number, if this is Alana Drew's number, it's Belle. Can you call me back on my cell?' The tone went dead ending the message and I removed the towel with haste to delete the message until I saw Tommy from the corner of my eye at the bedroom door. 'Friend of yours?' He could tell by the look on my face that I didn't like the message but I wasn't having some heart wrenching talk with him again. This wasn't like the last time, the last time I told him about my family, it was on my terms. I told him how much I would allow him to know at the moment but this was new. 'Lana?' 'It's my doctor. I had a pregnancy scare.' I told him with a forced laugh and saw the shock on Tommy's face eventually be replaced with relief when he realized I was joking. I hit the delete button without hesitation and Tommy seemed to realize I'd managed to boycott him. 'You sleeping here?' I asked as I climbed into my bed, 'or you can let yourself out. I'm flat out.' 'There I am thinking I'll have a better welcome back than that,' his grin told me he was only minorly joking but he took off his shirt and jeans anyway to climb into bed. His strong bicep was used as my pillow as I rested my palm on his broad chest, how I loved to run my fingers down his abs but I resisted the urge and settled for just sleeping instead. ~VD:T~ In the morning, Tommy wasn't there. A quickly scrawled note telling me that he had to get to the gym welcomed me into the new day and also an annoying beeping sound. That is neither my ringtone or alarm. Completely out of it, I sat up and scratched my head - what the fuck ? I felt around the bedside table until my hand clasped around something unfamilar. Making my eyes focus through sleep, I realized it was a phone. I hadn't realized I'd anwered it until there was someone talking to me. 'Tommy?' 'What?' I lay back down in bed hoping sleep with come while holding the phone to my ear, 'you've reached Alcoholics Anonymous, this is Alana Drew, can I help you?' 'Excuse me? Is this Tommy's phone?' The voice on the other end sounded accented and I suddenly realized I was holding a phone to my ear, I sat up again awake now and held the phone away from me. It was Tommy's mobile. FUCK and I'd answered it. Then it hit me, it was a womans voice. 'Yes, he isn't here right now.' I told the woman on the phone who was relentlessly asking, 'are you there?' into it. 'Who is this?' 'Who the hell is this? You called me.' My defensiveness was coming out again and I recalled deja vu. I was like this at work too. 'Where is Tommy?' This woman was beginning to piss me off and I was becoming really annoyed. Lack of sleep was making me very hostile. And I was beginning to get a little jealous too. 'Are you listening to me? I just said he isn't here - now who are you?' 'Pilar. Can you tell him I want to speak to him?' 'Yes, I'll tell him I want to speak to him.' I said and before the woman could say anything I hung up on her. Resting my head on the pillows, I willed sleep to come but it wouldn't. I was too concerned about that woman. Groaning, I got up, got dressed and headed to Colts gym making sure to grab the phone. ~VD:T~ Storming through the door of the gym, I didn't even spare a look at the Asian man who seemed a little baffled at my entrance. I burst right through the other door and stood there scrutinizing everyone until I saw Tommy across from me furiously jumping rope. His eyes were focused on something on the other side of the gym but I didn't care. I made a beeline for him and although I was running on about 10% jealousy and 90% lack of sleep, I grabbed Tommy's hoodie from the bench behind him where his gym bag was and threw it at him causing the rope to get tangled and him to whip his head around looking as if he wanted to snap the neck of whoever interuppted his staring competition with whatever had his attention. 'Lana, what the hell?' 'Who the fuck is Pilar?' My voice wasn't raised but a few guys stopped their training to look over and I realized that every time me and Tommy seemed to have a falling out, it was always in public, here to be exact. Tommy stared at me if he wanted me to leave right away. He snatched his mobile from my hand and shook his head at me as he shoved it into his gym trouser pocket. 'Don't talk about shit you don't understand, alright? Now get outta here, Lana. I'll see you tonight.' 'No,' I said and crossed my arms across my chest, 'who is she?' Tommy had turned his back to me but his back mucsles were tense and he was breathing slowly as if trying to calm himself. 'Lana-' 'Tommy.' I deadpanned and he turned around. He took a step forward and grabbing my arm, he pulled me into a changing room. There was nobody around and Tommy shut the door behind him, leaning on it to ensure nobody came in either. 'What did Pilar say? Does she need help? Is she alright?' Pardon me? I laughed humourlessly. 'Yeah she's fine and dandy. Sprinkling rainbow drops on merrygold muffins as we fucking speak - who is she, Tommy?' The main part of my anger wasn't jealousy. I didn't get jealous easily - I was more irked about the fact she'd woken me up and had the audacity to ask who the hell I was after I'd asked her. If looks could kill I'd be cremated already. 'Lana,' Tommy looked down and wrung his hands, it looked as if it was a distraction for him, 'don't fucking talk about her like that.' I didn't say anything giving him a chance to elaborate. Soon enough Tommy met my eyes and licked his teeth before he sniffed as if preparing for a fight, 'Pilar is the widow of my best friend who died in the war. Manny. The friendly fire.' WELL FUCKING DONE ME. I felt my heart sink into my stomach and ran a hand through my hair to try and stop myself from crying from embarassment right then and there. Tommy sensed my shame. 'Yeah? Ring a fucking bell now?' He said bitterly and I caught his eye resisting the urge to continue this argument. I was in the complete wrong and I had no right to make this worse than it already was. 'Tommy I-' 'Forget it,' he made a move to step away from the door so he could leave but I caught his hand pulling his arm to me. He could've gotten out of my grip so easilly but he didn't. He shut the door again and stood there, not looking at me. 'Her call woke me up. I'm running on about four hours sleep after... last night.' 'What about last night?' Tommy met my eyes this time and looked adorably confused. I didn't want to tell him but I felt like I owed him some reasoning after my exaggerating reaction to this womans call. 'You had a nightmare last night.' He looked at the wall behind me as if he'd just spaced out and shook his head, 'no, I usually wake up.' 'You did,' I clarified and hugged his arm to my chest, 'you kept yelling out for Manny. Then you just kinda fell back to sleep again.' We both stood in silence until Tommy sighed, 'I should have told you about Pilar.' 'No, you shouldn't. I had no right to go off on you like that. I'm sorry. Did I ruin tonight?' Tommy smiled and put his other hand on my neck bringing me into some weird hug as I buried my head in his chest. He kissed the top of my head and said, 'no way.' 'Good - now, I have to get to work.' Tommy let me go, 'when do you start?' 'About ten minutes ago - you off again this weekend?' I ask as I walked through the door, Tommy following me and I glanced back at him to see him nodding but he seemed deep in thought. 'Did you wanna come?' I furrowed my brows, 'where? With you this weekend?' 'Yeah,' Tommy rubbed the back of his neck, I could tell he hadn't asked someone to join him in something before. I felt confused but overly flattered at the same time, I may have nodded a little too enthusiastically, 'yeah sure. Your Pop too right? Like some family day out.' I closed my eyes and cursed myself, 'Tommy I didn't...' Tommy seemed to finding it quite amusing though, 'it's okay.' The words seemed honest from him but something in his eyes told me that what I'd said meant a little more. As far as I know he doesn't have any more family. I had a meeting with Patrick in a few minutes, maybe he can shine some more light on this weekend than my non-talkative boyfriend. I can't remember if I said I was going to include Pilar in this but I am now. Anyway, next chapter is going to be a little weird, alright? I'm hoping that I'll get everything I want to in there and then commence the jump in time. PSY WON AN EMA. Yeah yeah yeah :) Anyway, I just watched an old video of Tom Hardy on Alan Carr: Chatty Man and it made me so effing hot for the guy that I just HAD to write a chapter also, the amount of reviews I got for the last chapter was amazing - thank you so much guys for all the support. The more reviews I get, the more motivated I am. Song is The Consequence by You Me At Six.[Chapter 11] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : there's something I can't confess, from all the truth that I've said, tell me what you want to hear : Chapter 11 Part 1: Brother Brendan I sat across from Patrick in one of the AA personal rooms. 'I'm sorry I'm late,' I took off my coat and unwrapped my scarf shooting an apologetic look at Patrick who just smiled, 'I was with someone.' Patrick didn't ask who. I don't think he had to if the knowing smile was anything to go by. Tommy probably hadn't mentioned me unless he'd told his dad already that I'm joining them this weekend. The clock read 2.34, I was 14 minutes late and therefore only had 16 minutes left to talk to Patrick about his drinking before we could officially delve into more social topics. I took out his file and ticked a few boxes, behaviour was good, co-operation in meetings I'd been told is satisfactory, I saw a comment from Kelsie in one of the margins: he expressed to group he thinks it's only 'matter of time' before he drinks again - please discuss. 'It says here Mr Conlon that you think you'll slip back into old habits.' Patrick didn't meet my gaze and put his hands out in front of him on the table. He twiddled his thumbs and my time in AA told me he was thinking so I didn't press. I just waited. 'Tommy isn't the best person to live with.' Did Tommy drink? 'Does your son tempt you, sir?' Even though I'd told Tommy I'd keep this strictly professional, the thought of Tommy waving alcohol in his fathers face made me uneasy. It sounded like something Tommy would do to get back at his dad. 'No,' he says gruffly and clears his throat, 'no he doesn't do that.' Patrick put his hands on his lap implying he was uncomfortable with this subject. I moved on. 'Did you want to have frequent meetings during the week? At the moment you're scheduled for twice a week, we can-' 'Alana, I don't need AA.' 'If you believed that, you wouldn't be here. Besides, if you think you coulda done it on your own by all means, stop wasting our time and don't attend any more meetings. Next time you pass a bar, go in and order a whiskey. See how long it will take you to down it.' What I'd said was probably harsh but when a client begins to think AA is unnecessary, it's up to us to convince them otherwise. I cared about Patrick more than any other old ex-drunk. 'I don't have much company.' I crossed my leg over the other and tapped my pen on my pad, 'we can arrange out of office activities for you.' The professional talk was being to bore even me. Patrick met my eyes in a knowing look and we waited until the last minute clicked down and finally, we were able to talk properly. 'You know, you're always okay to drop in here when you feel lonely. You know I'm not busy anymore now that the phones aren't my problem anymore.' 'Working the phones made you busy?' Like father like son. Clearing my throat, I put my pad away and laughed softly, 'did Tommy tell you about this weekend?' 'Sparta.' Patrick nodded, 'he told you?' 'He actually invited me.' The old man furrowed his brow and leaned a little closer to me, 'you sure you wanna go to something like that?' What had I let myself in for? I didn't know much about this tournament at all - I hadn't even had the time to google it either. I was just so flattered Tommy even invited me. 'It's just a boxing match, right?' 'It's MMA.' 'Male Mating Academy,' I laughed but stopped when Patrick looked uneasy. 'Are you alright?' 'Alana, I don't think you should come this weekend. Tommy hasn't told you anything about it.' 'I was actually going to ask you.' Asking Patrick wasn't probably a good idea anymore considering he looked as if my presence there would bother him. I hadn't thought it would be a really big deal. I'd watched boxing matches, karate, fighting in the Olympics, I'd seen Rocky a hundred times, I'd played Tekken, Dead or Alive - fighting didn't bother me. 'I've seen wrestling before...' Patrick shook his head, 'it's not the fighting. I... Tommy isn't the same when he's in a cage. He's nothing but animal. I don't know what he's thinking inviting you.' 'Moral support, you're just his trainer after all.' I bit at him and Patrick looked a little shocked I'd even said that. I was shocked at myself. I was defending Tommy but at the same time defending myself for being so naive. Of course Tommy wasn't going to be my boyfriend in that cage, he was going to be pure, muscular fighter. He was probably going to terrify me. 'Brendan will be there. Tommy isn't even phased by the fact he might have to-' 'Who the hell is Brendan?' Patrick looked as if he wanted to laugh but shout at the same time. 'He really hasn't told you anything, has he?' I was getting angry now, uncrossing my legs I leaned across the table, 'well then enlighten me, old man.' 'Brendan is my eldest son.' Patrick held my gaze without hesitation, he'd obviously had it up to his neck with my retorts, 'Tommy's brother. He's also in the competition.' Oh my God. I leaned back in my chair feeling as I'd been deflated off my high horse. 'And he's...' 'Also in the fighting competition,' Patrick repeated slowly and stood up, gathering his jacket, 'I guess I'll see you this weekend.' The comment was snarky and sounded strange coming from someone who is usually so calm and collected. I'd been put in my place, obviously. I ran a hand through my hair and put my face in my arms on the table. What was I getting myself into? ~VD:T~ The next day, I was tempted to call Tommy and cancel our firework date but I didn't. Instead, I went through the day as normal and continued to get ready. Black skinny jeans, a white and blue stripey long sleeved shirt and a brown pair of flat ankle boots. I wasn't in the mood to impress him and the way I was so eager to say something, the evening probably wouldn't end on glowing terms. The buzzer sounding at 8 signalled he was here. 'Come on up,' I said and pressed the button to let him in. That woman obviously wasn't letting him into the building anymore. A part of me suspected it was a horny Mrs Shaplot. Grabbing my black and grey jacket off the chair, I opened the door before he could knock. 'Hey.' I just forced a smile at him and caught his slightly baffled look as I didn't even invite him inside and just walked out into the hall. 'You okay?' 'Yeah.' I said and started walking, 'why wouldn't I be?' Tommy shrugged and took my arm in his hand linking it through so we were arm in arm. It was a cute gesture and totally unlike Tommy but I couldn't let myself be happy or woo'd by it. It seemed my mood with Tommy nowadays was becoming more and more hostile. 'Where's this firework show?' 'Just down here,' I said but before I could go through the gate which led to a field, Tommy stopped and was looking at something. He nudged my arm and I caught that soft smile before he looked down at me, he had an idea. 'Follow me.' The firework show was a part of the church's way to convince people to attend religious meetings on Sunday mornings - most people in my neighbourhood though just went to enjoy the show. The field was filled with people and boxes and boxes of various fireworks were stacked on top of eachother. Tommy led me through the crowd towards the small church. I stopped in my tracks, 'Tommy we can't go in there.' He looked so hot when he was being mischievious. 'Technically, we won't end up inside.' Before I could question it, he opened the door with ease and pushed it open, the darkness inside suggesting it was empty. I'd never been inside and I'm guessing neither had Tommy yet somehow, he made his way through the darkness, me clutching his arm to my chest in an attempt to keep him as close to me as possible, and he reached a set of stairs. 'Come on,' he whispered into my ear, he turned me so I could go up first and he kept himself pressed to me, his arm around my stomach as I slowly went up the stairs. 'I'm going to jail,' I whispered and laughed as Tommy chuckled under his breath. 'Tommy, what are we doing?' 'I saw a rooftop.' He said as we stood at the top of the stairs. It was cold, dark and there was a set of doors that looked to lead to different places. 'I wanted to watch the fireworks from there.' A firework outside made me jump and Tommy pressed me him as he laughed. 'We're lost.' 'We're not,' I said heading towards the door where the stairs were, 'we just have to-' I tugged on the door and when it didn't budge, I looked desperately at Tommy who went from amused to confused. 'What?' 'Tommy,' I said and tugged on the door somemore, 'it's not opening!' We were still using hushed whispers just in case but I was starting to panic. 'Tommy!' I felt Tommy come up behind me, he was still laughing a little and tried the door, even with his brute strength, the door wouldn't open. 'Maybe it locks.' 'Or you're not strong enough,' I rolled my eyes, the dim light in this tiny hallway we were in making the atmosphere a little cosy but the air was freezing. Obviously one of the three doors led outside. I tried pushing them all but they wouldn't open. We were trapped. Tommy tried the door again and then turned to me, a cocky look on his face. 'I'm glad you seem okay with this.' I shivered and hugged myself as I sat on the cold floor, 'we're trapped in a creepy cold church and there's fireworks going off that I can't see and to top it off, I'm kinda mad at you.' 'When are you not mad at me?' Tommy made a joke. Hallelujah, Tommy made a joke. He crossed the hall and sat beside me, he used his jacket as a kind of blanket and we both hugged it to us. 'Why didn't you tell me your brother is in this Sparta competition?' Tommy's face fell and he shifted. 'I didn't think you needed to know.' 'I'm going to this tournament this weekend with you. A tournament I don't know anything about let alone probably enjoy just because you asked me to. And you couldn't tell me that your brother is going to be there?' There was silence and I rested my head back on the wall behind me. If I wasn't so cold, I would've moved away from him. The confined space we were in forced us to communicate, perhaps that's what it takes. Tommy began to speak. 'Me an' Brendan don't talk much anymore,' Tommy was looking ahead of him and I moved my head slightly to watch him seem to struggle with the words, 'me an' ma made a plan to take off. Bren didn't come.' 'Why?' I whispered. 'Met a girl. A fuckin' girl.' 'Don't curse my gender if you please.' I said trying to lighten the mood, 'you still hold it against him?' I sensed Tommy leaving me, he was distancing himself from me emotionally. Bringing my hand up, I stroked him gently down his spine, he breathed and leaned into my touch a little bit. I drew words, pictures and patterns on his back and it seemed to work. His breathing went steady again and he continued, 'ma turned into my responsibility instead of both of ours. He stayed with drunk Pop and left me to watch her die.' Closing my eyes, I bit my lip, I couldn't begin to imagine what that would be like. But I know what it's like to be abandoned by family. I ran my hand up around his neck and into his hair. 'If you don't wanna come this weekend anymore, I get it.' Scoffing I leaned my head back on the wall, letting my hand fall from Tommy's warm skin, 'I'll come this weekend, Tommy.' Tommy turned towards me and caught my smile, he pressed his lips to mine and I deepened it just to savour the warmth. His arms went around me and he leaned back backwards, his weight not fully pressing down on me. The fireworks outside continued to shrill and explode and although I couldn't actually see them, Tommy's presence right now was making me see fireworks and stars in my head. Moving his lips to my throat and neck, he nipped and sucked the skin there, resisting a moan, I heard a bolt. I sat up with Tommy and we both stood quickly before the door flew open. A man stood there, a broom in one hand and a set of keys in the next, 'you two lost?' Tommy and me exchanged a look before we ran out of there like a pair of teenagers, laughing and making it outside just as a red and blue firework exploded into the sky. Alright, so this is part 1 of Chapter 11. The next chapter will be part 2 and then after that will be a jump in time. So, the weekend that Lana is joining them on is indeed Sparta. Anyway, thank you so much guys for all the reviews. I love updating quicker if it will get me more feedback. Song is Secrets by OneRepublic.[Chapter 12] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : betrayed but not gonna be willing to change & it doesn't seem likely to fade : : i can't seem to understand it how you turned out to be so cold : Chapter 11 Part 2: Tommy Turned Stranger 'You're actually going this weekend?' Kelsie stood with her arms across her chest completely disregarding the instruction I gave her to help me pack. I gave her a look that said, 'don't ask' and continued throwing some things into my suitcase. Tommy told me that the competition would run into the beginning of next week but according to work, my illness is going to get worse Sunday night. 'Am I going to actually meet him at some point?' I stopped what I was doing and sat on my bed facing away from me, I ran a hand through my hair and turned in her direction, 'Kelsie...' 'Don't do that. Don't 'Kelsie' me. You're in over your head and you know it.' 'Okay, I do.' I cried out and stood up, 'Alright?! I do know I'm in over my head and frankly, I can see myself drowning. I can see myself becoming frightened of the one guy who has made me feel sane since I moved here because he's so driven by violence. I can see myself saying something incredibly stupid to his dad and ruining my friendship with him. Keslie, I can see myself leaving Tommy and not even looking back.' 'Then why?' She asked me softly finally realizing I was well aware of everything she was thinking. 'Because I care about him so much.' I said honestly and sat back down on the bed, 'I don't love him yet but I think I can, y'know?' Kelsie was silent and that was my confirmation. She wasn't okay with this but she'd support me. I wasn't one to confess how I felt about a guy and all the minor dates I'd been on since I moved to Pittsburgh hadn't lasted more than dinner and Kelsie knew that. Tommy was different. 'I don't like this,' she said and took a shirt out of my hands, putting it in the bag, 'but I'm with you.' ~VD:T~ Arriving in Atlantic City had been a neither comfortable or pleasant journey. Tommy refused point blank to talk to either me or Patrick, so Patrick decided to engage in conversation with me and Tommy hadn't liked that either. I wasn't allowed to talk to his dad but he didn't want to talk to me either. Makes sense. When we arrived, there was a limo waiting for Tommy. It was like he was some big celebrity. Lots of people were gathered and shouting for autographs. Parick went into full trainer mode, grabbing Tommy who grabbed me and yelling at anyone that, 'Tommy isn't signing anythin'.' I remembered that Tommy said he didn't like attention. That's why this competition was clearly for the materialistic things and the outlet for his frustration. This wasn't for the fame or the fans for Tommy. 'Ya alright?' I looked at Tommy who hadn't spoken to me since the plane and nodded. Truth was, this was a little much. 'You know, fans are screaming my boyfriends name every day.' Patrick smiled a little at the joke but Tommy didn't find it funny. He could read me like an open book. He knew this was too much for me already. Maybe if he made the experience a little more bearable I wouldn't be wishing it was ending right now. The hotel was another awkward moment. Tommy didn't seem ready to admit in front of his dad he'd be sharing at room with me. I settled for a single room next to theirs and paid with my own money. Where is my boyfriend and who the fuck is this guy? I couldn't help but think that back home, Tommy would be much better. More like a gentleman. Patrick was wrong. It wasn't when Tommy was in the cage that he was a different person, it was when he was around his father that his exterior just had a massive wall come up to protect him. He wouldn't allow anyone in or anyone to witness a potential weakness. Which is exactly why he couldn't have his dad see his soft side with me. He couldn't have his dad comment on our relationship because that would mean he's delving into Tommy's life. As I reached my room, Tommy shifted in the hallway before watching his dad give us a minute. I glared at him and smacked my hotel keycard on the locking device before I stepped in, I was almost able to shut the door before Tommy held out his hand to stop it. 'I know ya mad... again.' Tommy shut the door and I threw my suitcase onto the single bed. I watched it roll around and hit the floor with a thump. It wasn't a big enough thump to leave me satisfied, I kicked the thing as well for extra measure. 'I'm furious Tommy.' He didn't say anything and we stared at eachother. It could be mistaken to palpable sexual tension but me and Tommy both knew if he took a step towards me with that kind of intention, I'd hit him. Instead he held his hands up in surrender and bent his head, 'you wanna go home already?' 'No,' I said sarcastically, 'I want to stick around longer to watch my boyfriend ignore me and leave me alone in this fuckin' hotel room. No, Tommy, I don't wanna go home.' I rolled my eyes and sat myself on the bed with a hump. He watched my curiously, 'I have to get ready for my first fight.' I waved my hands in his direction, 'then off you pop, fighter boy. I'll be in the stands, you know, innocent bystander and fan after all. You want me to see you after the show or make an appointment with your trainer?' Tommy's eyes flashed and he glared, 'isn't he the one making appointments with you?' 'Don't throw at me, asshole.' I seethed and looked away, breathing steady to calm my anger. 'As much as I'd love for you to stay, I'd much prefer to watch you leave now.' I didn't have to ask twice. Tommy left with a slam of the door. This was getting ridiculous. I spent more time mad at Tommy than I did happy with him. I'd obviously made a big mistake. ~VD:T~ Credit to Patrick, he'd pulled me aside and asked if I wanted to stand sidelines with him to watch Tommy's first fight. I'd shook my head. 'No,' it had taken a lot to even come out from the hotel room and watch it on TV there, 'I'm fine there.' Making my way into the bustling crowd, there was already lager on my boots and sweat on my arms. Gross. I'd texted Kelsie and lied, the woman would still be able to know I wasn't having the time of my life here though. My phone rang once more although it was barely heard over the chaos of the waiting crowd. It was like a very passionate football game... only they wanted to see blood. 'Hello?' The voice on the other end made me stop as if every inch of my body was thrown into ice. Not right now. Not now. Not when I was already having a really bad couple of days. 'Alana, I've been trying to call you.' I hung up without a second thought. I should have checked caller ID. I'd stil saved her number just as a warning in case she called. I breathed in and out as if I was suffocating. I practically was with all these people and now this... this blast from the past I'd been trying so hard to run away from. The people who kept barging into my weren't helping and I felt sick with all the shouts, the men spitting all over themselves as they cheered on. The commentators were talking flippantly and the lights overhead were blurring together. For a moment I thought I was going to faint. I needed Tommy. Quickly, I made my way out of the crowd and towards the backstage rooms. Just as I was about to barge into Tommy's changing room, I was pulled back by a strong arm. 'Ma'am, no reporters.' 'I'm not a reporter,' I breathed trying to look around the big African man who was in the way of my only chance not to fall down and cry. 'You can't go in there.' He said sternly and I backed away a step before bracing my hands on my knees, for a moment he looked worried, 'are you alright?' 'Please get Tommy.' I breathed and he looked like he was going to back down, 'please, he knows me, please.' The man looked skeptical but turned around and went into Tommy's room. Just as my knees caved, I was being held up and I was surrounded in the scent I knew all too well. 'Tommy.' 'Babe, what's going on?' He was shirtless and looked about ready to go in there. The crowd was relentless, desperate for brutal entertainment but Tommy didn't spare the persistant guy at his side urging him to go to the cage a second look, his grey eyes bored into my brown ones and then that was it. I was okay. The sick feeling disappeared and was replaced with butterflies and I smiled. I pressed a kiss to his lips not allowing him to deepen it or pull away and whispered, 'I didn't say good luck.' He knew I was lying but didn't have time to press it before I ran away and back to my place. Tommy's presence was overwhelming to everyone in the stands. As soon as one person spotted him, the entire crowd errupted into a frenzy, I was beginning to wonder how Tommy had gotten so popular prior to the competition. I spotted a woman to the side of me. Her disarrayed blonde curly hair was bouncing as she screamed like an animal. 'Excuse me,' she spared me an uninterested glance before turning back to the cage, she shouted Tommy's name now. I felt a little jealous and cast a look at the other females in the crowd, there weren't many but there were a few. They all seemed to be ogling my boyfriend. My Tommy. 'How do you know Tommy?' The woman scoffed, 'how can you not know Tommy Riordan?' 'Is he a famous fighter?' I asked innocently and glared at a man who barged into my back. The woman laughed a little manically and turned so I had her full attention. 'A video spread around the internet. He's like an animal in a fight. He beat down some mohawk guy like he was nothin'.' Mohawk guy? Mad dog? 'I see,' I nodded. I'd have to check out this video. Tommy went into the ring, skipping pre match interviews and photo's, he didn't even stop to sign autographs, the only people I spotted him even giving a second look too were the young boys in the crowd who were desperate for his attention. Tommy wasn't someone you could describe as 'all heart,' but he seemed to have a soft spot for kids. The man he was fighting was smaller in size but seemed more agile with the way he was bouncing around on his toes. He seemed cocky and an 'in your face' type of guy. The match began and before I could even blink to prepare myself, Tommy went in with a powerful punch. The man went down. The crowd around me exploded into anarchy. People hugging eachother, pushing eachother, the woman beside me joining many others in screaming in absolute delight. Tommy didn't bat an eyelid, just sniffed and stormed right out of the match. He wasn't much for rules then. The man in the cage was lying there, he seemed to be breathing as a medic assisted him in sitting up. The ride side of his face was turning purple already and it looked as if his jaw was broken. Tommy had done that. My boyfriend had caused that man that agony he seemed to be in as a tear slipped down his face. Whether it was due to humiliation or pain, I didn't care. I glanced around me at all the people who seemed to be enjoying this. I swallowed and bit my lip. I was afraid I couldn't stay. That was just one punch, Tommy wasn't even touched - he wasn't even breathed on by the other guy but yet somehow, it had made me panic again and this time, Tommy couldn't save me. Instead, I settled for getting the hell outta there. I was a second away from the door when I heard his name. Brendan Conlon. Turning back around, I saw the crowd weren't so antsy for the brother of the guy there were just moments ago screaming for. Apparently he was a physics teacher as the commentators continued to make remarks about how he wouldn't last. I saw a close up of his face on the overhead screen and saw no resemblance to Tommy whatsoever. Their eyes could be mistaken for the same colour, their bodies were different, Brendan was leaner, he wasn't so athletically inclined as Tommy was. I hung around as the match started, I was impressed along with some others at the way Brendan held his own but soon the other guy had the upper hand and I watched the mans face get brutally assaulted. I had to close my eyes and I made a disgusted sound in the back of my throat. I'd lied to myself. Convinced myself I'd be okay with this when really, I wasn't. Pushing the door leading to outside wide open, I let it shut behind me, drowning out the sounds of the crowd and the emphasized cracking of the punches thrown. Some people who seemed to be on a cigerette break looked at me weirdly and I didn't have time to think of a smart retort, instead I walked quickly away from the door, away from the arena, well away from Tommy. Atlantic City wasn't anything special at night than it was during the day. Scattered fairground rides, there was a beach nearby but it was way too cold to potter around near the sea. My flimsy jacket wasn't enough to keep me protected from the biting wind. It's not like I can leave without going to the hotel first, my things are there. Did I want to leave? I heard my phone ring and saw I'd had two missed calls from Tommy. I'd been gone for almost three hours. 'Yeah?' 'Where are you?' He wasn't angry, perhaps concerned. 'Out,' I said simply and began the long trek back to the hotel, 'I'm on my way back.' 'Where are you? It's late, I'll meet you.' 'That's okay,' I told him, I didn't want to see him right now, 'I'm okay.' Silence on the other end told me Tommy had an idea of why I was wandering around a foreign place late at night in the cold, 'did the fight bother you?' 'No,' I told him quickly. Too quickly. 'I love watching my boyfriend knock someone out.' He sensed the tone and sighed before hanging up. Tommy's fighting wasn't up for discussion let alone be the topic of an argument. I would lose, there was no doubt about it. I. Would. Not. Win. That. Argument. When I finally reached the hotel, I was shivering and tired. My thoughts were jumbled and my eyes were hurting still after all the flashing lights. My brain was filled with images of Tommy, the guy he beat and Brendan. When I knocked on Tommy's door, Patrick answered it. He was in a dressing gown and held a remote in one hand and a tape device in the other. He quickly swept the headphones from his head when he saw me and looked down, self concious. I waved my hand and shot him a small smile, 'I'm wearing the same thing underneath,' I told him and watched him relax as he took a seat on the couch, me sitting opposite. 'Tommy here?' I asked quietly. Patrick gestured to the closed door behind him and stopped me before I reached it. 'He won't talk about it. Unless you're going in there to congratulate him, don't bother.' Patrick looked at the TV before doing a double take and almost spluttering. I turned around puzzled and saw a news cast with an army cadet on the screen. 'Turn it up,' I said and listened to the army private talk about Tommy. Tommy Conlon. 'He saved my life. He saved all of us. Tommy, if you're watching, we wanna thank you-' I stared at the screen, I couldn't believe what I was hearing and the image cut to a military video of Tommy appearing at the door of a tank and ushering people out of there quickly before it filled with water. I knew Tommy was in the army but he was a war hero. Patrick returned to stand next to me and I felt a pair of eyes on me. Turning, I saw Tommy at his bedroom door, he went from watching the screen to me as if gouging a reaction. I smiled proudly but it was obviously the wrong one, Tommy reached inside his bedroom, grabbed his jacket and went for the door. 'Tommy, where ya goin'?' 'Tommy,' I said and he stopped for a split second before shaking his head and opening the door. 'Where ya goin'?' Patrick yelled. 'For a walk.' The door slammed shut behind me and I offered Patrick a supportive look. He slumped back on the couch as the broadcast ended. 'I saw Brendan.' Patrick looked up at me as I took the seat opposite him, 'oh yeah? He took a beatin' didn't he?' 'I didn't stick around to find out,' I told Patrick honestly. He asked me why with his blue eyes and I felt hesitant to tell him. But something broke in me and taking a deep breath, I swallowed my pride, 'you were right.' Patrick furrowed his brows but didn't say anything to allow me to continue. 'I wasn't ready to see Tommy fight.' 'Tommy didn't get hurt.' My silence made it clear and the old guy nodded, I continued, 'I thought I'd be impressed. Be able to stand there and cheer him on. I can't.' 'Alana...' I felt like I was going to cry and I'd be damned if I cry in front of one of my clients. That was their job. 'Patrick... don't patronize me, alright? Don't tell me it will get better or I told you so.' He shut his mouth and nodded, 'I was gonna tell ya I think ya need to talk to him.' 'You said yourself. Unless I'm wishing him a congratulations, he doesn't care. Fighting is off limits.' 'To everyone else.' I bit my lip, still usure. 'Can you...' I stopped, I had no right to ask something like that. Patrick looked at me knowingly. 'You want me ta say somethin'?' Nodding, I felt something my stomach contract nervously, was this the right thing to do? I didn't have to ask twice. I excused myself and went into my room. ~VD:T~ The door next to me shut and I remembered Patrick was going to see Tommy. Shifting my weight a little, I decided to go after him, let him know that I'll talk to him myself. I had no right even if I was vulnerable to ask Patrick to talk to Tommy. I knew he'd be nasty with him. I followed him to the elevator to see it had already gone down, I watched as it went to the 3rd floor, the Casino. How did he know he was there? I took the following elevator and was met with a friendly hostes. 'Can I help you?' 'Is a Tommy Riordan here?' She looked confused and sighed, 'he's popular tonight. Over there.' I followed her finger and saw Patrick sat with Tommy. I approached them before I heard Tommy's voice and I stopped behind him. 'The only thing me and Brendan Conlon have in common is we have absolutely no use for you.' His voice was low and soft as if he was explaining something simple to a child. I saw Patricks heart break in his eyes and his head was bowed as if he was trying his hardest to keep himself together in front of his son. I'd never witnessed Tommy be so cruel before. When I thought the brunt of Tommy was his violence and anger, I was welcomed with the image of him being an admirable war hero and now here he was. Breaking his father down into pieces right in front of me. 'I liked you better when you were a drunk,' Tommy went back to his casino game and my breath hitched, 'at least you had some balls then. But she's helpin' you, aint she? She's helpin' you become a better man,' I realized he was talking about me now and I fought the urge to make myself known. Patrick or Tommy hadn't noticed me. Patrick was getting humiliated, verbally assaulted and stripped down into pieces right in front of me because of my useless self. I had asked him to talk to Tommy knowing fully well Tommy wouldn't talk to him. I had been so caught up in my thoughts that I'd missed what Tommy had said but all of a sudden, he was raising his voice, 'get the hell outta here.' Then he chucked his cup of coins in his fathers face and I saw Patrick flinch from the blow. I couldn't help it. I let out a single sob. I wasn't crying but that heartbreaking expression on the old mans face was enough to make me want to pound Tommy to the ground. They both turned and saw me. Tommy looked surprised to see me and then for a minute, from the look on my face, he looked guilty. A little part of his eyes flashed in the same way they did when we argued, he felt bad. But it wasn't enough. He didn't apologize, he didn't stand up, he just turned back around back to his game and as Patrick stood up to leave, I flinched when Tommy punched the machine twice, three times before I couldn't take anymore. I took off. ~VD:T~ It was 4AM. A knock on the door was my cue to hang up my phone to the airport and stand up. I stood in the centre of the room as Tommy entered. He was wearing a grey T-Shirt and jeans, his hands were stuffed in his pockets, his expression stony until it landed on my packed bags that lay on the bed. Then he turned angry. He began to shake but I didn't give him a chance to argue with me. 'I don't know you.' My whispered words were like a brick to his skull. He reeled back as if I'd physically struck him. I had no intention whatsoever to hurt him but I couldn't do this. 'We rushed this...' 'Rushed what?' He asked through gritted teeth. It was soft but harsh, enough to make me realize this was the right decision. 'Us,' I laughed humourlessly and patted my jeans. I didn't know where the old me was. Who would crack a joke and the atmosphere would turn back to normal. No sarcasm could remove this tension though. Tommy was scowling. I didn't expect him to drop to his knees and beg for this to work but he was so emotionless now that I was beginning to wonder if he had even taken in what I'd said. Figuring there was nothing else to say I collected my bag and headed to the door of the hotel room. As I passed him, he spoke. 'You goin' home?' 'I think I should,' I said softly and smiled at him as I ran a finger down his cheek, thankfully he didn't pull away. I put my hand on the handle when I finally turned away from him but made no move to open it yet. Instead I rested my head on the wood and felt him come up behind me, his arms wrapping around my stomach as I felt I was finally breaking. I didn't know what I was waiting for. Him to convince me to stay, him to say that this anger inside him was just a fluke and that he would be Tommy again? The way he had spoken to his dad - how he had turned so violently into someone I didn't want to associate with. Patrick didn't deserve to be treated the way his son did tonight. 'Tommy,' I turned around in his arms and he looked at me steadily, I think he expected me to say I'd changed my mind, 'I want you to win this.' He stepped away from me but I stepped forward and brushed my lips on his jaw, 'when you finish this and get all of this anger out of you, find someone. Find yourself a girl, yeah?' I chuckled under my breath but only to stop myself from smiling. I wanted to be that girl. I wanted to be that person he trusted enough to hear about his nightmares, I wanted to continue to sit with him for hours and be the one he claimed as 'his.' But Tommy didn't need or even want a girl right now. I knew that. Patrick even knew that. He wanted the rush that came with the violence of this competition. He wanted the money to help Pilar. 'Go home, Lana,' Tommy breathed and I nodded, understanding. Grabbing my bag, I walked out of the door and left, finally able to cry. That's it. I knew the events were jumbled but it was the only way I could do it. Also, I didn't use word for word in this chapter. Alright, this is where there is a time skip. Only a few months. After the competition and after Tommy finishes his trial. He gets let off due to his war heroism and his shoulder being busted, he doesn't owe the Army anything anymore - alright? So, next chapter will be around four months ahead and won't follow the movie. The events still happened but Lana wouldn't have been there to witness them. Let me know what you think of Part 1 of this story. So, I got another piercing today in my ear and I can't smile. So I refused to watch Lawless because I knew that if I saw Tom Hardy, I'd explode into smiles although I hear it's pretty gritty. Does anyone even read this? Song is False Pretense by Red Jumpsuit Apparatus that sums this chapter up in a nutshell.[Chapter 13] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph Part 2 : i hear you're doing really well, been so long you look good : Chapter 12: Don't ruin my life, Tommy Conlon 'Five more seconds.' I tapped my watch five times before I lifted my head and shot a proud smile at the middle aged man opposite me, 'Mr Kayle, you did it.' 'Thanks to you,' the man breathed and the wrinkles around his eyes were clear when he smiled, 'you helped me.' I shrugged off his thanks not unkindly and stood up before snatching the vodka shot away. Pouring it down the small sink and throwing the glass into the cupboard below it, I crossed the room back to my desk and put a huge red tick on Mr Kayle's sheet. 'Show this to your wife, she'll be so proud of you.' Showing him to the door, Ms Jamison was waiting when I reached my office. She had made herself comfortable in the blue comfy chair and I took the seat opposite her with my hands on the desk, 'something I can help you with, Ms Jamison?' The look in her eyes was enough. I knew what she was about to say. The same thing Kelsie has said, the sly comment from Mrs Shraplot last week, it was the same, 'I don't know what's happened but don't stop,' she laughed, 'you're very popular here, Miss Drew. Clients love you.' Of course they do, I'm polite now. I bowed my head in thanks, 'happy to help.' 'Yes, you are.' She said seriously and then stood up, 'tomorrow's Valentines, doing anything special?' Although the urge to slap her was there or say something remotely sarcastic, I bit my tongue. 'No, I have the day off though.' Humming her acknowledgement, she left me alone and I glanced at the picture frame that held the newspaper clipping. My breath still hitched whenever I saw it but it made me smile anyway. ~VD:T~ The next day, I'd been planning on sleeping in for as long as possible. Ignoring the fact I'd have to leave my apartment at some point to get a new packet of cigerettes, I turned the radio off when all they played were gooey love songs. I planted myself on my couch and settled for watching a Welch channel that looked like it was playing a soap opera. There were no subtitles but there were also no couples, that was a bonus. My phone tone reminded me I was still in this stupid day, in my pj's cooped on my sofa watching foreign soaps. 'Yeah?' 'Let me guess,' Kelsie's voice was loud and a horn told me she was either driving or walking down a busy road, 'you're sat at home, alone as usual in your penguin pjama pants and your Christmas sweater watching some zombie film.' 'Soap actually. Welch,' as if that was any comeback at all, I thought to myself and rolled my eyes, 'alright, alright, you got me. What're you doing? You working today?' 'I'm sick,' she fake coughed into the phone, 'I'm actually on my way to a clients house. He called this morning apparently. Jamison said he asked for you so you owe me for this.' For some reason, this bothered me and it made me curious as to who it was. 'What's his name?' 'Didn't ask. Just got an address here in the 'Burgh. Why?' Her question was simple enough, she was interested into why I was asking her for details. I don't know what I expected her to say. Tell me something I'd dreamed of hearing since I left that hotel room. That Tommy was back home. But he wasn't. Last I heard, he was on his way to Granger Court to fight for his release from the military. The papers kept me well up to date. That's why the newspaper photo of him and his brother hugging after Sparta was sitting on my desk at work right now. 'No reason, I gotta go.' Gradually getting dressed I decided to remove the thoughts of damn Tommy and went out to buy my current distraction. Smoking. It was an unflattering, unattractive and down right disgusting habit but it helped. Soothed. The woman looked up behind the counter when I walked in. The air was still a little frosty but it wasn't as bad as it was over the Christmas. A loose fitting black jacket covered my black shirt and I'd shoved my grey skinny jeans into a pair of brown ankle boots. I'd made a small effort but it wasn't enough to turn any heads. A if I do anyway. 'Morning, Alana. Usual?' Nodding I rummaged through my bag for my money as she placed 20 Mayfair on the counter. The woman let out a small squeak and I looked up with furrowed brows to see the packet of cigerettes was back in her hands as if they'd been thrown at her. 'She doesn't smoke.' That voice. I completely froze and wanted to close my eyes, tell my cruel mind to stop playing such jokes on me when I was still in utter cardiac arrest everytime I thought about him. I'd thought our relationship was way too new for it to have such an effect on my life. When I left, I relived that moment again and again in my mind, in my dreams about what a mistake I'd made. I thought I'd forget about him. But his voice still made my heart jump and I turned quickly to see him stuff his hands into his pockets. He had a slight stubble but it looked good. His light blue jeans and the black jacket looked new, not worn and he smiled. He actually smiled at me. It wasn't a happy smile though, it was a sarcastic smile. 'Or does this new habit go with this new... you, going on?' He gestured to my hair and I fiddled with it self conciously. I'd highlighted it light brown to make it look like a caramel colour and it was styled into a new length. Still short but the strands didn't look so messy. Because of my promotion at work, I had to look the part. 'Tommy,' I breathed out and felt my breath hitch. His name from my lips felt so foreign but my god, I'd waited so long to finally see him again. 'Lana,' he nodded and looked behind me to the woman and then back to me, 'ya done?' He held up a pint of milk, 'I'm waiting.' I don't know what I'd been expecting to be honest. Him to come running back into my arms. Me to fall to my knees and cry. I had left him after all. I'd watched one fight and then walked right out of his life. I bit the inside of my cheek simmering my anger and stepped to the side, 'keep those ciggies on the counter, Mel. I'm paying for them.' I shot him a dirty look and he licked his teeth before sniffing. Mel, the poor cashier looked a little intimidated by the much broader figure of Tommy but obliged with my instruction. When Tommy'd paid he turned to me and leaned his side on the counter. Mel took her cue and I watched begrudgingly as she escaped into the back of the shop. We were alone. 'How you been?' Tommy laughed humourlessly, 'how you been? Peachy. You?' I could see where this was going, 'Tommy I'm-' 'Dont,' he held up his hands and swung the milk off his pinky as a way of fidgeting, 'I'm over it. Took your advice.' 'My advice?' 'Got a girl,' he glanced behind me out the window and I reluctantly turned in fear of what I'd see. A blonde was waiting outside in the cold, her pink jacket was hugged to her body and when she saw Tommy waving she jumped up and down like a little puppy and waved like a lunatic. I scoffed and looked back at Tommy who was looking at me as if he expected me to bawl. 'Nice choice,' I said sarcastically and noticed it was probably the first sarky thing I'd said since I came back to Pittsburgh, 'she borrow that jacket off her Barbie Night Out doll?' He looked momentarily amused before quickly replacing it with a cocky attitude, 'I'm treatin' her. Valentines and all. Where's your guy? He off running errands with his best friend who he is secretly fuck-' 'Tommy.' We both turned to see the blonde poking her head through the door, she bored her eyes into mine and she made her way fully into the small corner shop. Her long fake blonde hair that was tinged with black roots fell into her eyes and her white high heels clacked on the tile floor. This was Tommy's type? I thought I'd be jealous. But nothing about this girl was envious. And then she made her way over to Tommy and put her arm around one of his strong arms like I used to do and I felt my heart strings pang. 'I thought I saw you talking to someone. This your mum or something?' Her laughter was silenced as me and Tommy both let out a sharp gasp. She looked between us and I gouged Tommy for a reaction to the blondes stupid question. His grey eyes did that familiar flash and I saw him shake. She looked startled, 'what is it baby?' Before I could even think what I was doing, I took a step foward and shoved the blonde out of way. I planted my hands on Tommy's abdomen and stood right in front of him. His grey eyes looked into mine and then, in that moment was the time I wanted to cry. Tommy was still the vulnerable boy I'd left at the sheer mention of his mother but he looked good, he looked mature. What I thought would be another relapse resulted in Tommy just closing his eyes and he removed my hands from his body. It was awe worthy how Tommy didn't give in to his anger like he used to. 'Tommy, you-' 'You aren't my girl anymore.' He said harshly and I must've looked shocked because he directed his attention to the blonde who was fiddling with her hair, 'ya never were.' The blonde opened her mouth in a gasp and let out some unladylike expletives before she dramatically ran out of the shop almost falling over due to the ridiculous heels on her feet. Silence overcame us once more and I shifted my weight before Tommy sighed, 'you aren't buying those,' he pointed to the cigerettes and I let out a soft laugh at the look on his face. 'I won't buy those... if you come and get breakfast with me.' For a moment I thought he'd refuse. I thought he would return to the immature, stubborn Tommy Riordan I'd left alone in the hotel room but instead, the man who stood in front of me smiled and nodded, 'alright.' Alright, so I felt bad and decided to update. Okay, so as you can see they've both kind of changed and originally I did want Tommy to be mad at Lana but the whole point of him losing Sparta and him being threatened with the fact he may have to return to the Army which ultimately destroyed him was that HE'S CHANGED. I want Tommy to grow up, is that alright with everyone? I hope the story doesn't lose it's appeal - I have things in store for them both and it will still evolve around fighting, don't worry. And it's nice to know that people actually read my A/N's. I like writing these more than the story sometimes. Thank you again to everyone who is reading, following and reviewing. Means a lot and makes me update faster. Song is Play With Fire by Hilary Duff - that girl had some catchy ass songs in her career.

Tommy sipped his coffee that I'd noticed he'd never done so before unless it was forced on him. Tommy didn't drink coffee unless it was to be polite. He looked confused and I focused back on my cup of tea, I poured three sugars into it and stirred, 'the blonde.' A soft chuckle made me look up and Tommy was leaning back in his seat, his jacket was beside him and I could see his toned muscles, the tattoos poking out of his tight T- Shirt. I'd missed him. 'She wasn't my girlfriend. I saw you walk into the store, she approached me wanting an autograph. Thought I'd try and-' 'Trust me, I wasn't jealous.' The way I'd said it, the most illiterate of person could've sensed I was telling the truth but there was some lingering depth to it. He shouldn't have treated that girl that way. I couldn't help but think it's something the old Tommy would do. You can't change everything, I guess. 'I got that,' Tommy's smile made my heart lurch and I distracted myself by blowing gently on my tea. I thought our reunion, not that I'd thought it would ever happen, would go differently. There'd be yelling and tension and anger and Tommy would walk out exactly like I'd walked out on him and then we'd go on with our lives. There was still so much to talk about. 'You look good,' I said truthfully. He did. His body looked even more muscled, his hair was shorter and more styled, his face looked fresher and his eyes were sparkling. He nodded in thanks and gestured, 'you too. What's with the hair though?' I fiddled with it with a frown, 'what?' He took a lock of it between his fingers and I felt shivers, he tucked it behind my ear and leaned back, 'it was much better natural.' Shrugging I flicked it back out so it went back in my face, anything to hide the growing blush on my cheeks, 'it will grow out. It's only hair.' There was an awkward silence and I breathed slowly, I wanted to ask him the burning question. 'Tommy - how are things now?' 'Good,' he said quickly. Too quickly. I reached across the table and touched his hand gently. Stroking a finger across the back of his hand, I half expected him to pull away. 'Your dad is back, isn't he?' That's where Kelsie was headed today. I knew it in my gut. He'd asked for me and he was back. Patrick was back. 'Pop is...' he turned his hand so his palm was facing up, it seemed my touch was calming him, helping him collect his thoughts, 'Pop is okay. He's better.' 'Did he relapse?' 'When you left,' he said with a curt nod, 'I kinda lost it.' I swallowed and gripped his hand, this time he tensed and his grey orbs stared at me sternly. He waited for me to talk but I hesitated, he looked as if he'd snap at the slightest utter of my words. 'You... you understand why I left, right?' 'No,' Tommy tore his hand away and sipped his coffee, 'I don't, Lana. You'd seen me before knock someone out. You knew the shit between me and Pop was bad.' I was shaking my head before he'd even finished and cast a look at the few people in the cafe, there weren't many and they were too engaged in their own conversations to listen in on ours. 'Tommy, that wasn't it.' 'Explain it to me then.' This was something I'd been planning to do later on. But I owed it to him. 'I was frightened.' Tommy's eyes flashed but not with anger, with something else. Sadness perhaps? 'Of me?' 'No way Tommy. I cared... I care about you so much. I was frightened I would stop caring for you if I stayed. I couldn't witness that animal coming out of you.' He didn't say anything else and I realized he was trying to understand. It must've been killing him all this time he still had no idea why I'd walked out and left him in his hotel room. 'Animal's still there.' I stood up and watched his body tense and I slowly walked around the table, keeping my eyes on him as I sat beside him. He turned his body in my direction but made no move to touch me at all. His eyes were gouging my next action as if he was a deer caught in headlights. Scrunching my brows I tried to figure out what I would say next. 'Tommy, I miss you.' He scoffed but his eyes didn't leave mine and I think I saw a glimmer of hope there. I put my hands on his strong thighs and looked down, 'I get it. I hurt you-' 'Don't flatter yourself.' I stopped, let him have his retort and tried again, 'I don't deserve any of your time but I think there's things we need to talk about. I was still finding out shit about you.' 'Wanna talk about hiding shit, Lana? Who the fuck is Belle? Don't blow me off 'bout some doctor joke excuse either. You have a panic attack whenever she calls you.' I looked at him as if he'd slapped me. I swallowed the lump in my throat and stood up. I wasn't having this conversation. 'I think this was a mistake.' Tommy glared at me and stood up too, 'it's a mistake when we talk 'bout you. But all my secrets and scars you wanna know 'bout.' I made a beeline for the cafe door knowing fully well he was following me. I made it just outside when my forearm was grabbed. I whirled around and kept my head down as my chest clashed with Tommy's. 'Please,' I whispered and looked up at him helplessly, 'please don't do this.' Tommy's breath was coming out harshly and he slacked his grip only to trail his hand down my arm and around my waist. I buried my head in his neck and fought the burning urge of tears. Tommy's breath was soft on my neck and it made all my hairs stand up. 'Lana, I want us to work.' He whispered and then leaned back, 'let's talk.' I nodded and sniffed as I thought about how I could possibly get out of this. Was I ready to tell Tommy about Belle? I glanced at the cafe and laughed and caught Tommy's puzzled smile. 'Tommy, we forgot to pay.' He cast a look around and chuckled as we quickly made our way across the road, the direction of my apartment, 'looks like we aren't going there again, then.' ~VD:T~ 'You went back to Army?' I asked, my legs were tucked underneath me on the armchair while Tommy sat fiddling with one of my cushions opposite me on my sofa. 'Nearly. Got so close. I was in and out of trials before they deemed me phyically unfit 'cause of my shoulder.' I nodded and leaned my head back on the headrest, this was the most information Tommy had told me in a while. He'd talked through the fight, Brendans wife Tess who Brendan had showed a picture of to Tommy before their fight, how the Army said he was a war hero now and needn't go back. 'Do you talk to Brendan?' Tommy leaned back and threw my cushion on my lap before flicking it back up. I noticed he liked to fidget when he was uncomfortable. 'He calls now and again, he's so determined for me to go visit.' 'Why don't you?' Tommy looked at me and caught my gaze. He knew if he didn't answer my question, I had a free pass on one of his when this conversation turned around on me. He shook his head and sighed, 'too weird. I can't stand his wife, I don't know his kids.' 'And you never will,' I stated glancing outside the window to my left when I saw a hot pink hot air balloon catch my eye, I'd forgotten it was Valentines. 'One day. Soon,' he shot me an encouraging smile and I knew he was telling the truth. I couldn't return it though because I knew what was next coming out of his mouth. 'Who is Belle, Lana?' 'My sister.' 'The one who-' 'Got in a bad crowd,' I finished for him and looked down. I couldn't look at him. 'When was the last you spoke to 'er?' 'Two years ago.' 'Before you moved here?' Nodding, I could feel the familiar feeling of guilt and regret fill my body, the urge to get on the next plane and fly back to London. But I couldn't. 'You're far away from them, Lana,' Tommy's voice was soft, it wasn't full of sympathy or pity like Kelsie's had been, 'they can't find you.' I let out a strangled sob. I bit my lip and faced even further away from him if it were possible. 'Tommy, you don't understand. When I left I made a promise they won't hurt me. Just listening to them beg me to come home hurts me.' He looked baffled, 'why won't you go home?' Silence. DON'T SAY A WORD. 'Lana, why won't you go home?' His voice, his sweet voice so full of concern and determination to get to the centre of my problem. 'Lana...' 'Tommy!' I finally met his gaze with a sharp one of my own. My brown eyes bore into his grey ones and I grit my teeth, 'stop.' 'We're halfway,' he said casually, 'dad's a runaway, mom's a whore, sisters on her way to being both - what more is there?' His blunt sentence and crude question made me look at him in shock. 'Don't treat my problems like they're nothing.' 'Now you're being a hypocrite,' he said and stood up to pace the floor as if I was being lectured. I felt trapped, I didn't like it. 'You don't wanna talk 'bout your problems and yet when I say them as they are, you get defensive, which is it?' I kept my mouth shut, he was being impossible. I felt the anger get the best of me but I tried to keep it tame. I wouldn't explode. 'You worried you're gonna get dragged back to London and be like your ma?' Tommy asked, he was leaning against the wall now across the room with a condascending smile on his face, 'or you worried if you sort it out with your family, you won't be the tortured little girl you are now?' 'Fuck you, Tommy!' I yelled standing up, I'd had enough, I grabbed the cushion and launched it at him which he effortlessly dodged, 'I won't talk to them, I won't see them, I won't go back to them because I've finally proved them wrong! I'd been convinced all my life I'm worthless, I'm too ugly to do anything, too stupid to make something of myself. I've done it. It's not the best job but it's a job! I've got an apartment, I'm in a completely different fuckin' country, I thought I found someone too,' I slumped in my seat. 'But he wants to know just like everyone else. What my daddy issues are. Why my mums pictures and porn videos are all over the internet, why half the money I make from work goes straight to my sisters drug problem, why my debts are up to my neck because I'd paid for hundreds of therapists to get my sister out of the same line of work as my mum.' I took a deep breath and stared right into his eyes, 'I had to take off or I'd end up dead.' Tommy didn't say a word and I didn't want him too. I was ashamed, embarassed and downright fucked up for him to have any thoughts on what I'd just revealed to him. After a moment I felt soft hands on my cheeks, lifting my face to be met with the beautiful eyes. 'Lana...' 'Don't.' I wrenched my face out of his hands and let a single tear fall down my cheek. Tommy ran his hands down my arms until he was kneading my hips, he rested his forehead on mine and we breathed eachother in. 'Feel better yet?' 'Yes,' I said sarcastically, 'I feel over the fuckin' moon.' His crooked smile made me smile too, 'there she is.' 'Shut up.' I sniffed, 'you can't say anything at all. You hold a grudge over your dad like a goddamn raincloud, you won't talk to your brother because he chose a chick over you and your mum, which I get it, is a bad move but you still hold him responsible for the responsibility you had to take on for your mum. Your blonde bimbo fan wouldn't know what a fuckin' make-up wipe is if it came and smacked her in the face and don't even get me star-' My rant was cut short when Tommy's warm lips covered mine in a sweet, loving kiss and he leaned back, 'you finished?' 'No,' I said but smiled a little anyway, 'my boyfriends an emotional wreck.' 'And my girlfriends got family shit as high as fuckin' tidal wave but am I still gonna take her in that bedroom right now to prove how much I've missed her?' 'And what shall I do?' I asked cheekily with a smirk, 'make a cup of tea and wait?' 'Come 'ere.' Tommy's hands and lips were covering me in a second and as we made our way into my bedroom, I finally felt uplifted. Relieved. Better. A lot of people have liked to know about Lana's family problems so here they are. Finally they can get back on track a little bit now. Song is Love Is A Battlefield by Pat Benatar.

I figured she finally got the message I wasn't interested in talking. I was evidently wrong as I lay on my stomach, dressed in Tommy's discarded T-Shirt on top of the duvet, watching my phone light up on the pillow in front of me. The caller ID unwelcome. Rolling my eyes I buried my face in my pillow and prayed for it to ring off. When it finally did, movement beside me caught my attention and I lifted my head to stare at a sleeping Tommy. He was laying on his back, the quilt gathered around his waist leaving his wonderfully toned torso bare and I had to stop myself several times from stroking my fingers in between his abs on display. His short hair was tousled from the way I'd tugged on it so many times last night, he looked peaceful when he slept. It was hard to tell he was the same man she'd been with a mere few months ago. All the pent up anger and vendetta's he had seemed to dissipate and although I knew he still had an undoubtedly short fuse and a viscous temper hidden within him, he had better control of it now. 'Don't stare at me.' I grinned and laughed softly into my hands as I turned my face away to put my phone on the dresser. I felt an arm around my waist and I groaned at the realization it was morning and I had work in an hour. 'I gotta go soon,' I told him as he flipped me around so we were laying on our sides facing eachother, his eyes were still closed but a smile lingered on those full lips of his, 'I'm expecting to see your dad today.' Tommy's grip tensed but he didn't say anything. I made my exit swiftly to the bathroom ignoring the burning temptation to ask how his dad has been since but instead I showered leaving Tommy alone to dress. However, my blissful morning ended abruptly when I emerged from the bathroom, dressed in a smart pair of jeans, high heeled ankle boots and a white shirt, and saw my shirtless boyfriend handing a mug of coffee to my very smug looking best friend. 'You're shirtless,' I stated the obvious still a little baffled at Kelsie's presence in my apartment. Tommy just nodded with a cocky smile and passed me to go into the bedroom leaving me alone with her. He was obviously finding this uncomfortable situation amusing. I could lie... he's a plumber, it got hot and he took his shirt off. Play it cool. Of course you can't do that, Alana. Tommy used to be rather famous, Kelsie knows him for crying out loud. 'Well I had a lovely evening,' she began with a quick sip to her coffee I noticed she was making no effort to hide her stupid grin, 'cooped up alone by the fire, lonely on Valentines and the thought that I'm not incredibly sad and lonely because my best friend is doing the same.' 'Kelsie...' But I was cut off as she stared at me with the utmost urge not to laugh and she continued. 'Probably crying while watching Bridget Jones, contemplating buying a hundred cats just for something to pet, a dildo website bookmarked on your laptop and a months subscription to Singleton's Are Us.' I held my stomach in mock offense and threw my purse at her which she easily caught and placed on my counter. 'So, spill then. What's he said to make you go all gooey eyed?' I glanced a look at the stairs where Tommy had disappeared and faintly heard the shower. I turned back to Kelsie about to answer when her eyes widened and she gasped. 'What?' I asked hesitantly. She pointed behind me to the stairs and seemed to be hyperventilating. 'Is he... is he showering?' Furrowing my brows I chanced an answer, 'yes?' 'Alana, it means he's naked.' I spluttered a laugh and nodded, 'no he showers with my bikini on. Of course he is. What's the deal?' 'You got yourself a hot one there, chick.' Kelsie observed and finished off her coffee while I fished around in my bag in my cupboards for the spare key, 'but listen, he hurt you.' 'We hurt eachother,' I said casually and placed the single brass key on the kitchen table. 'You both together could be the best or worst thing for eachother.' Kelsie was serious now and I turned to face her with a confused look. 'How's that?' 'He's got a temper and you like to light people's fuses. You don't know what he's capable of. You left him because you were scared.' 'No,' I sighed, 'I didn't. I left him because I was scared of losing my feelings for him. I wasn't scared of Tommy.' We both stopped talking when we heard him descend the stairs, he was wearing what he wore last night and smiled a little shyly to see Kelsie still here. He shifted and Kelsie decided to break the tension. 'So Tommy, what do you do now?' Shit, that was a question even I hadn't asked. I tried not to look so eager for his answer but he could tell I was when we caught eachothers eyes. He cleared his throat, 'I'm lookin' into being a trainer or somethin'.' His grey eyes didn't leave mine but I looked away to try and look busy as I rummaged around aimlessly in my bag. Kelsie crossed her arms across her chest and nodded, 'so, fighting again?' 'No,' Tommy said really quickly, I could feel his eyes try and sought out mine but I didn't look up. We hadn't even talked about this. I wasn't ready for him to delve right back into the Sparta tournament kind of life, the thought of him following his fathers footsteps wasn't a bad move but he was still going to be around fighting. 'Aren't you afraid of getting a taste of it and wanting back in?' 'Kelsie,' I looked up at her now and gave her a warning look. This was beginning to feel like an interrogation and not only did I not like it, I noticed Tommy becoming fidgety. Kelsie looked at me innocently and then back at Tommy. He was looking right back at her as if daring her to say something else that would tick him off. I didn't like the way any of the them were looking at eachother. Obviously, she knew when to leave and my best friend politely said goodbye before letting herself out. I stood in the centre of my kitchen as Tommy watched me with his eyes, I think he expected me to say something but I couldn't. 'Are you alright?' 'I don't know,' I said honestly, 'you didn't tell me you wanted back in the fighting. After everything last year, Tommy.' 'It's not back in,' he said tiredly as if he was already exhausted from this conversation, 'I don't even know yet. With my track record, what kind of job can I get?' He had me stumped there. He told me he hadn't finished school due to him looking after his mum. He didn't have any qualifications, probably had some petty crimes under his belt, he was threatened with prison after going AWOL in the army, he came second place in a fighting competition with him being notorious for being brutal in his matches. Bottom line was though, he's not like that anymore. Keep telling yourself that, Alana. 'Do you really miss fighting that much?' I asked ignoring the pressing time that threatened my job. Tommy leaned against the counter and rubbed a hand over his face. I knew that look. I nodded and grabbed my bag not wanting to be here anymore. 'There's the spare key there, let yourself out when you're ready.' I turned at the door and offered him a small smile, 'I'm falling for you way too fast to leave you again so therefore, even if I don't like it, I'll support you.' ~VD:T~ Just like I'd expected, Patrick Conlon was first on my list of home visits this morning. I began to think of it as a good thing. Besides, I'd always gotten information out of Patrick whenever Tommy wouldn't say anything to me. I had to remember though he was also the main reason our arguments began. 'Alana Drew,' Patrick said with pleasant surprise and he opened the door wider. There was brief moment when I thought he was going to hug me but he didn't, and I was thankful. 'Hello again, Patrick,' I took a seat where he gestured too and politely declined his offer of coffee. Trick one. Decline offers of beverages, you have no reason to stay longer than needed. 'How are things?' I asked as I got out his previous files and the notes Kelsie made yesterday. He was making unbelievable progress but I remembered what Tommy said about his relapse before Christmas. 'Better than they were,' Patrick took a seat and watched me curiously, 'you look different.' 'Promoted,' I told him and then went back onto the professional talk, 'have you relapsed again since November 28th?' 'No,' he shook his head, 'no.' I caught the look in his eye as he looked down, he was guilty. Good start. I didn't press it though. Trick two. Don't ask questions you already know the answer to. 'Are you returning to AA?' 'I don't think I will.' I closed my file and studied him, 'why am I here then?' 'I asked for home visits. My knees aren't good with driving anymore let alone walking to that place.' I nodded and scribbled that down. It was a fair enough reason to ask for home visits. I'd much prefer to talk to him there than in a stuffy AA client room anyway. 'What about Tommy?' I asked tentatively. 'What about him?' Patrick's voice went into a kind of regretful tone but it wasn't clear. 'Does he live here? Can he give you a lift?' Patrick watched me and then shook his head when he looked down. 'He lives close by. I wouldn't ask him for a lift.' He got his own place? Alright, no sex for a while. Tommy and I need to have a long talk. 'How is your relationship since the tournament?' It wasn't exactly a professional alcoholism related question but I couldn't help it. 'Brendan and Tommy are a lot closer than they were...' he trailed off and seemed to be thinking to himself, 'it will take more time with me.' I looked at my watch and smiled a friendly smile at him, 'it was nice to see you, it's been a long time.' Patrick broke out of his reverie and smiled back at me a lot more at ease now that his family questions were over. I stood up and brushed down my jeans, 'I think that's it.' 'When do you want me?' Patrick asked referring to his appointments but I couldn't help the dirty retort I made. '2 this afternoon, be in bed ready.' I smacked my hand over my mouth and saw Patrick go a little red, 'I am so sorry, I am usually a lot better at keeping those things to myself now.' 'Forget it,' Patrick walked me to the door with a beaming smile, 'I'm sure Tommy likes you better the way you were.' Yeah, he's probably expecting me to like him better the way he was before too. Digging out my phone in my car, I sent him a quick text message: If fighting is what you gotta do. It's what you gotta do. Remember I care. Lana x I wasn't expecting a reply at all but the one that came made me anxious and happy at the same time: Fighting is who I am. We'll talk later. Tommy. PS. I care too. Not the best chapter but I'm writing it at my friends house and she keeps looking over my shoulder at what I'm writing. I hope it tides you over. Alright, so I know it may seem like a cliche story now where Tommy goes back to fighting but stay with me, alright? There's only a number of plots you can do when it involves Tommy's career. I can't imagine him as anything but a cage fighter. So, it's going too AU or Mary Sue, let me know? Song is Six Degrees of Separation by The Script.[Chapter 16] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : it's in his DNA he takes my breath away & that's what makes a man : Chapter 15: Paintballin', Steam(y) and Drinks 'Wanna go paintballin'?' I leaned back on the couch and stuttered a little into the receiver. 'Tommy I wanted to talk.' A sigh on the end told me that he knew we had to, he just didn't want to. 'I know - we can talk after paitnballin'. Get a drink?' It sounded like a pretty cute day out. Tommy and Alana paintballing then drinking. If I was sixteen, I'd totally Facebook that. 'I'll pick you up tomorrow at 3 after work.' Tommy chuckled, 'I'll pick you up.' He was ruining my plan. 'Tommy, it's off putting to know you know where I live and now own a spare key to my apartment and I have no idea where you live.' 'It's nothin' special.' I sensed his wary tone and tried to put him at ease. 'Tommy, you know you don't have to impress me, right? I mean I've tolerated your accent for-' I laughed when I heard his lighthearted protests on the other end. 'Yours aint the nicest to listen to either, babe.' 'A million One Direction fan girls would disagree.' There was a pause and I'd thought I'd won. Then Tommy asked, 'are you from One Direction? Or a guy?' Fuck. I settled further into my sofa with a grin as he laughed softly when I didn't reply. 'Let me pick you up.' A defeated sigh came from him and I knew I'd won our primary argument then. I scribbled down his address and then we said our goodbyes as I actually grew rather excited about the next day. ~VD:T~ When I pulled into the neighborhood I could understand why Tommy might be wary about showing this place off. There weren't many shops except a few newsagents that had those glass windows to protect cashiers from rowdy drunks. A few teenagers hovered around the corners smoking only God will know but there was nothing unusual about that anywhere you go in Pittsburgh. The apartment block Tommy was in wasn't in bad condition at all. It looked like it held only a few tenants and it looked rather nice on the outside. I pressed the number 4 buzzer and waited. The air was moving swiftly into Spring so the air wasn't as cold as it was but still called for a warm jacket. 'Yeah?' His gruff voice made me want to laugh. So serious. 'You order pizza?' I ask in my most masculine voice. There was a pause before a hesitant voice came over the speaker. 'Lana?' 'Hole in one.' I jumped on the balls of my feet beginning to feel a little chilly, 'you gonna let me up or am I gonna continue to get checked out from this weird 17 year old across the road? I think he likes me.' The loud buzzer was sounding before I'd even finished and I laughed when I walked in to see Tommy stood on the top of some steps looking a little antsy. He was wearing a white vest and dark jeans. 'What kid?' I looked at him as if he'd grown another head, 'oh the teenager you're gonna pound into the ground? He is across the road with a big PRISON SENTENCE sticker on his forehead,' I followed Tommy into his apartment as he shrugged on a white shirt and his jacket. 'Seriously, you can't beat up kids.' Although the context was a little disturbing it was nice nonetheless to see Tommy a little protective over me. Even if it was over a fictional teenager story just to get a rise out of him. Tommy's apartment was like him. Clean in some places where everything was in tip top condition and order while other darker places and corners were in disarray. It was small but cosy. There were no stairs like the apartment I had but there was a hall to get to the bedroom and I caught a glimpse of a bathroom as I made myself at home. 'Why paintballing?' Tommy grabbed a set of keys, his phone and wallet and shoved them into his pockets. He shrugged again, 'I'm good at it.' 'Shooting people?' He gave me a knowing look and I facepalmed. Way to go again. I wouldn't have thought that a reminder of his time in the Army would be his idea of a day out but Tommy was an odd one. 'I'm driving.' I showed him my colourful keyrings and my customized car key, 'I drove.' Tommy came closer to me and pressed his front against mine. I didn't look away from his mesmerizing eyes and felt him reach up to brush his hand on my hip, moving slowly upwards before he brush the side of my breast, he grabbed my keys. Our breaths mingled and I felt fuzzy. 'Tommy...' 'Oh look at that.' Tommy smirked and broke our moment when he threw my keys behind him and they disappeared into his couch. I scoffed, 'fine, you drive.' 'I would have fought you for it anyway,' Tommy says following me out the door. 'Oh please. When it comes to me you got as much fight as a teabag.' I stopped at the main building door and gestured to outside, 'well come on then, princess. My carriage awaits and aint gonna drive itself.' I walked outside and heard Tommy laugh faintly as he followed me. ~VD:T~ Truth was I'd never been paintballing before. As I looked around the desk to pay in, there was a large fence and from here you could see paint splatters of different colours and faint screaming. It was like paying to go into a torture champer. I leaned into Tommy and felt our hands brush, 'this is where we come to die.' Our laughter died quickly when the line moved and the woman was looking at us expectantly and sternly. She didn't even bother to tell us the price and instead pointed to the cardboard sign beside her. Eight dollars each. I dug in my bag, 'I got it.' Tommy was shaking his head and shoving his hands into his pockets. At the same time we placed twenty dollars on the desk. The woman sighed and I smiled cheerfully. 'Tommy, you drove, let me pay.' I was directing my hard tone at Tommy while continuing to smile at the woman. Tommy grabbed his money and gave it himself to the woman who eagerly took it and cashed it, returned the change and moved us along so fast I could've sworn sparks came outta her ass. 'I aint one of those feminists out to prove my independence or anything but I can afford twenty dollars.' I was directed into a small booth where there were paintball guns and goggles. Tommy was laughing then, probably the way I'd say dollars. I was about to scold him until he took off his shirt and hung it up neatly on the wall of our booth. I took my time scanning that amazing body of it. The black tribal rippling across his chest and down his arms. We were going to meet up later for the drink so we could change but I didn't fancy getting my shirt paint splattered and instead took off my jumper and replaced it with a worn shirt I'd brought with me. Tommy put a hand on my hip, 'there was no point changin'. I smirked and leaned into him, 'why is that?' 'You aint gonna get shot.' I have to say I was a lot better than I thought. And Tommy was also absolutely right. Me or him didn't get shot once. Tommy was on fire out there. At some points I was worried with how serious he was taking it but then we would find eachother in a wooden shack and he'd beam at me as if he was really enjoying himself. Seeing him in action made me really hot for him. Maybe that's how he expects I should feel when he is fighting. When we were back in the booth, we were both panting hard and I sat down on the stool. 'You were really good.' 'I'd say the same but you're such a damsel,' Tommy said jokingly as he peeled off his sweat covered vest and went about putting his shirt back on. After I'd taken off my worn shirt leaving me in just my bra and thin tank I stopped him and stood up so I was pressing against him. I spotted some cleaning wipes provided on the wall and taking one I started cleaning my hands off and daringly, dipped the wipe onto my chest area getting dangerously close to the top of my cleavage. Tommy glanced out the window quickly - whether it was him being modest or him checking for nosey perks, I wasn't sure. Nor did I care when backed me into the booths wall, his arms on either side of my head and he kissed me deeply, roughly not even asking for permission when he claimed my tongue with his. Oxygen was becoming a problem and he removed his lips only to lean his head on my shoulder, his breath tingling my neck, his body pressing into mine. 'You drive me crazy.' If this was effect it had on me when he was in action, could I get around him being a fighter? Before Tommy was driven by nothing but pure animalistic anger, now he knows what it's like to have family instead of a tournament title and medal. I leaned up and ran my hand into my hair and stroked down his back, 'I want to see you fight.' Tommy's body tensed and his breathing hitched before he slowly lifted his head to meet my eyes. 'What?' I leaned my head back, I couldn't believe I was asking this. 'You practice in the gym right?' 'Yeah,' Tommy nodded, 'my shoulder still gives me some problems but.. Lana, what ya sayin'?' 'I want to see you fight. In the gym, whereever.' His eyes went from confused to relieved and then surprised. I could see so many different emotions in the split second when he was still looking at me until he he kissed me quickly on the lips, 'I'll sort somethin'. Thank you,' he breathed into my neck. I wasn't sure there was anything to thank me for yet. I didn't expect to see anyone different in that ring than the animal Tommy was last year but I was hoping I was wrong. I needed to be wrong for our relationships sake. This story was half typed on my phone during a free period and half written down on scraps of paper on the bus.~ Anyway, I saw an interview with my boyfriend (Tom) and Joel Edgerton talking about Warrior and how each characters attitudes to fighting are different and Tom himself said that Tommy's character literally lives and breathes fighting, war and drama. I can't see how just a mere few months, a messed up shoulder and his brother is going to just erase that no matter how fluffy I want this story to be. Therefore, there will be fighting, if that's alright with everyone? Is that okay? Song is DNA by Little Mix. A really annoyingly catchy song which I thinks speaks for the most part of this chapter. Thank you to everyone who has reviewed/followed/favourited this story and sorry for any spelling mistakes. This story isn't beta'd and my computer likes to change my lexis into American.[Chapter 17] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : tell me like a man - lets have a heart to heart, we need to stay together : Chapter 16: Mad Dog vs. Tommy Tommy picked me up at eight and we got a cab into the high street for that drink we arranged. He was still bewildered by my request back in the booth but he didn't press it. Shakespeares was a high street bar, there weren't many places that were high class in Pittsburgh but there was no in between. You either spent big or spent the evening down the local pub - that's all that's on offer in Pittsburgh's night life. 'You gonna pull rank and argue with me over who is paying for these too?' Tommy pointed to our drinks and I scoffed. 'Hell no. Pay for your own, yours was more expensive.' I caught his proud expression and sat closer to him. We were sat at the bar on two stools that we had shoved together and was enjoying the buzzing atmosphere. I had tried to make myself a little more decent tonight and wore think black tights with ankle wedges and a long sleeved white dress type top finished with a black belt. I had curled the ends of my hair and put on a little more mascara than usual but there was no point. Whereas all the girls in this bar put me to shame regardless of my effort, Tommy who was simply wearing jeans and a black top that stretched over this torso had put every guys intention to pull down the drain. If the girl wasn't looking at Tommy with hungry eyes, they were looking at me with envious ones. And if they were doing neither, they were frantically searching Google Images on their phones trying to discover where the hell they'd seen him before. 'You alright?' I nodded and Tommy cast a quick look around. He spotted something because taking his drink in one hand and my hand in his other I was gently pulled through the crowd and toward a table near the back. There were still stools due to the high table but it was quieter. 'You wanted to talk right?' I couldn't help my soaring feeling at his thoughtfullness and I dipped my head at the drink I had barely managed to pick up before I was pulled away. 'I kinda said what I needed to.' Tommy cocked his head, 'that you wanna see me fight again?' I caught his hopeful look and swallowed, telling him seriously, 'don't expect me to like it. I said I would support you.' 'What if you do?' Tommy took a swig of his Jack, 'like it?' I rolled my eyes and snorted completely unladylike. 'Yeah I like the idea of my boyfriend getting beat up.' 'That wasn't the reason.' Tommy countered evenly and I matched his tone. 'You're right,' I twirled the ice in my drink, 'I am scared you are going to forget everything you lost last year to continue this tournament.' 'Like you?' I narrowed my eyes, 'like Brendan. Your dad relapsing. Your shoulder. You were barely let off by the Army, Tommy.' His eyes flashed and I could tell I was delving into territory that made him uncomfortable. But because I don't control my mouth when I'm already talking, I had to push it. 'Don't get me started on Pilar. 'What has she gotta do with this?' I shrugged, 'what does she think of you fighting again?' Tommy scanned the room as if for a distraction and cleared his throat, he seemed to front a little bit and although he wasn't shaking, this situation was making him angry. I took more of my drink to calm my nerves and welcomed the warm feeling. 'Pilar's fine.' 'Just as long as she gets money, right?' Back the fuck off, Alana. I could tell I was pushing his buttons. This woman hadn't done anything to me. She'd experienced the loss of her loved one, the father of her children, Tommy cared for her. Probably more than me right at this moment with the way he was glaring at me. I hadn't planned for our evening to get so hostile. 'You don't know her, Lana. Jesus! This jealousy act don't suit you. Grow up.' I was just about to retort when a hand clamped down on my shoulder roughly. I jerked in surprise and instinctively turned around to confront whoever startled me. '-the fuck?' Mohawk Guy. What the hell was his name again? Bad Dog... Mad Dog? He was stood behind me with a smirk. I had heard about his humiliating defeat against Tommy in Sparta. Hearing movement behind me suggested Tommy was standing now. 'Hey gorgeous,' Mad Dog directed at me, his smile seemed to get bigger when he saw my drink almost empty. I made a noise of disgust and turned back around to take another swig of my drink. I was beginning to get very buzzed. Tommy was still standing, I gestured to his seat, 'Tommy, sit back down. The moron behind me can take a hint.' Obviously Mad Dog wasn't used to being ignored though and the next thing I know I'm being hauled to my feet roughly with a hard grip on my forearm. I was face to face with Mohawk Man and I don't know whether it was the alcohol in my body or the fact his serious expression was just funny, but I burst into laughter. Tommy was at my side in an instant and I was released when Tommy pinned Mad Dog to the wall behind me by his neck. 'Don't touch my girl.' I fell back into my seat and reached for my drink, downing it and pouting when it was over. I sneakily downed the rest of Tommy's too. I felt warm and fuzzy. People had begun to gather around Tommy's dramatic behaviour towards Mad Dog but I paid no mind. The alcohol had my complete attention as I immediately found a pattern on the wallpaper very interesting. I don't remember drinking this much. I hardly ever get drunk. I tried to think back to how much I'd ordered but my mind started to get cloudy. I turned around woozily to ask Tommy only to see him throw a packet of pills on the ground he had taken from Mad Dog. Oh. I realized that I had left my drink unattended when Tommy was paying for the cab and I'd gone to the toilet. It was only briefly but it started to explain my current wooziness. Tommy was threateningly speaking to Mad Dog before he shoved him away and dismissed the crowd. He turned around quickly back to me and it took me a moment and pain in my arge for me to realize that I'd fallen off my chair. He ran to me and then... does Tommy have a twin? There was two of him. They both looked really worried and they were saying something to me but it was jumbled. I was laughing really hard at the sounds they were making and reached out to touch Tommy #2 but my hand went through him. My laughter continued and then there was black. ~VD:T~ I heard Tommy speaking downstairs. His voice was nice. Really nice. I tried to focus more on it but my head started to pound. I felt bile rising in my throat and I managed to open my eyes. I saw my white ceiling. I was in my apartment. I raised my hand to find it tangled in my sheets, groaning in exasperation as I wanted to sit up, throw up and drink something all at the same time and I can't untangle my hand from this goddamn sheet! I let out a frustrated sob and heard Tommy run up the stairs. He appeared at the doorway with his mobile to his ear and grabbed his head in relief when he saw me awake. 'She's awake. Yeah. Later.' He threw his phone on my dressing table and crossed the room quickly to kneel at the side of my bed. I struggled again biting my lip when my head throbbed. Tommy quickly threw my duvet off leaving me feeling bare in my tank and underwear. But right now wasn't a time to feel unconcious. He'd seen it all before anyway. 'Baby, stop struggling. You're okay.' His tone was concerned but soothing and I gribbed my head. 'What...' Tommy put his hands on my neck and it gave me somthing to focus on other than the agony in my head, '...happened?' Tommy looked away and fiddled with the glass of water on my bedside table. Noticing it I went to grab it but Tommy helped me sit up before passing it to me. I gulped it like it was oxygen and then hugged it to my chest shivering delightfully at the coolness. I looked at him expectantly. 'Mad Dog roofied you.' I blinked. 'He roofied me when I was on a date with you? What was he trying to do? Help you get in my pants or what?' Tommy pursed his lips and ran a hand through my hair. I must look horribled and I excused myself, making my way slowly into my bathroom gripping the wall at some points to steady myself. I closed the door and dared a look at my reflection in the mirror. I groaned and sat on the edge of my bathtub. Tommy didn't bother knock when he came in a moment later. 'I could've been peeing.' He was on his knees in front of me then and put his rough hands on my bare thighs. I looked right at him and saw him look...guilty? 'This wasn't your fault.' I put my hand on his cheek. 'You got drugged when you were out with me.' I sighed and felt my stomach clench. I was falling fast for this man. And hard. Tommy licked his lips, 'I was gonna take you to the gym with me today but...' I stopped him and checked his watch, it was a little after seven in the morning. 'No, I'm feeling better. I wanna go.' Tommy smiled, leaning up and kissed my forehead. 'I gotta go. I'll see you at Colts at 1?' 'Who are you against?' I asked as he walked towards the bathroom door, he grabbed his phone and then appeared again with a grin on his face. 'Someone who deserves what's coming to him today. Later baby.' I heard his descend the stairs and shut the front door behind him. I had to laugh a little at who he was going up against. I think I would enjoy this fight. It's a shorter chapter than usual. I didn't get much reviews for the last chapter. If the story is losing it's touch, can you let me know? You can always give me some ideas on what to include. Someone reviewed for some Mad Dog so I wrote him in. So yeah, I hope it tides you over. I'm beginning to write more on my phone so I'm managing to update a lot quicker than usual even if they were kinda short. I can either write longer ones but not as frequently or write shorter ones where you get an update every other day-ish? What's better? Song is Heart to Heart by the Korean band 4Minute. I got a lot of praise when I included a Big Bang song as one of the songs, it's nice to see some fellow K-Pop fans (if you like Gangnam Style and it's only Korean song you know please don't include yourself as a KPop fan) Thank you again for everyones support.[Chapter 18] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : we all have our horrors & our demons to fight, tell me you love me 'cause you need me so much - stay with me tonight : Chapter 17: 'I Won't Ever Leave You.' I had no idea what to wear to a gym to witness a fight. I mean, a dress is too classy but I don't wanna turn up in sweats. Using the excuse that I still don't feel 100% I settle on a pair of jeans, flat boots and a jumper. Knowing fully well I wouldn't know anyone there, I began to get a little nervous. I'm not good around strangers. I end up saying something offensive. Patrick was living proof of that. I was worried about Tommy though. He had a vendetta against Mad Dog now. There was no way he was going to go light on the guy. Just as I arrived, Patrick called. Luckily, I didn't have to lie about my whereabouts. It seems his relationships with his sons hasn't detoriated and Tommy had in fact notified him about his fight which is a breakthrough. 'Why did you decide to go, Alana?' I felt like I was being interrogated by my father. I felt a pang in my chest and laughed it off. 'Girlfriend and all that.' I flashed a quick smile to the Asian on desk duty and pushed the door to the main gym open. 'Appointment Thursday?' I heard Patrick cough viciously and I winced. 'You alright?' I caught Tommy's eye across the gym, he was leaning against the ropes that circled the ring and he looked sweaty. Gorgeous as hell though in those jogging bottoms and tight grey vest. Before I managed to get my head back into Patrick's conversation, he was wishing me goodbye and hung up. 'Patrick.. Pat-' I shoved my phone away, caught Tommy's eye again and offered a quick smile and thumbs up before walking towards the far wall. I'm happy with watching from afar. I didn't want to go over there and expect PDA. Tommy wasn't like that. He looked momentarily confused but didn't have time to walk towards me when Mad Dog somersaulted into the ring in a pair of tight shorts and circled it like a maniac. He was looking right at Tommy with a cocky grin and was beckoning his hands at him. Tommy ducked his head but I caught his slow, threatening smile before he lifted himself effortlessly into the ring. I knew why I was here. I knew exactly why I was nervous about me being here. I didn't want to see Tommy become who he was. I like him how he is now. But the way he stood still, calm as he waited for Mad Dog to make his move as compared to the way he was running on pure anger when I saw him in Sparta. He was prowling around the ring before, too eager to end the match just to prove a point, just for a moment of satisfaction that he can become someone powerful. Now, I saw him look collected. He looked reasonable in the match like he's fighting for something bigger than just himself and a goddamn title. But I also saw the way Tommy was looking at him. The same look he'd had when Mad Dog had grabbed me - only more menacing. It wasn't as if I was lurking in the shadows, which is why I shouldn't be surprised when someone leaned against the wall beside me. He had a smoke in his mouth but it wasn't lit and he looked as if he saw a woman in a gym to watch a fight all the time. 'You here for Tommy?' I glanced at him and nodded. He was mixed race and the nametag on his camo jacket said, 'Colt.' 'You're Colt.' 'The man,' he smirked and I just offered him a small, half hearted smile. I looked back at the the ring to see Mad Dog getting his hands bandaged up. Tommy's were done already but he wasn't pacing impatiently. He was simply waiting. 'He's different.' Colt stated. I was getting minorly irritated at his presence but I asked why anyway. 'Look at 'im.' Colt gestured to the ring and my eyes focused on the way Mad Dog was lunging, his attacks so fast and unorganized that I could barely keep up. Tommy was only dodging. Wasn't moving too quickly but wasn't moving slow enough to get hit either. He looked so in the game, his mind wasn't boggled with all these other thoughts. 'I'm looking,' I said softly and flinched when one of Mad Dogs fists almost came in contact with Tommy's face. He missed and I saw the way Tommy was fighting. Or lack of fighting, rather. He was looking as if he was biding his time, tiring Mad Dog out. Mad Dog was grunting now, frustrated at his failed attempts of hitting his opponent. 'He talks about you, you know.' At this, I physically turned to gape. 'He does?' Colt nodded and took the cigarette out of his mouth only to tuck it behind his ear. He leaned closer to me and turned me back to the ring. He pointed and spoke lowly, 'I hardly know the kid. He wanted Sparta, I got him Sparta. He came back a week later, messed up shoulder, bruised up face. His brother, Brendan was with him.' I watched Tommy expertly throw off each one of Mad Dogs blows until he finally tired and Tommy made his move, he threw one punch and backed off, letting the shock of being hit sink into Mad Dog. 'His brother,' Colt continued, one of his hands on my shoulder now as we watched the fight, 'put up a hell of a conversation. Getting me to accept the kid back in my gym. He was in and outta here as you know, trials and all that. Hospital appointments. His physio for his shoulder was over quicker but that didn't surprise me, his need to fight, that didn't surprise me either. What surprised me,' Colt looked at me now but I couldn't look away from Tommy, my stomach clenching itself into knots at this liberation, 'was what he answered when I asked why he hadn't pounded every guy in here, wanna know what he said?' Nodding, I glanced at him before looking back at Tommy who clearly had the upperhand in this fight, Mad Dog was struggling to stand. Tommy took it slow and steady but every blow he landed on Mad Dogs face was full of brute force. 'He said, 'I gotta reason to fight now, not an excuse to,' I don't know if that means anything to you but-' 'No,' I said and grinned, holding in tears when Tommy landed the final punch to Mad Dog leaving him on the ground, 'it does,' I smiled and thanked Colt with my eyes before I met Tommy halfway in the gym, he enveloped me into a hug and I was lifted into the air and turned around as his face was buried into my neck. I didn't care I was now covered in his sweat, as soon as my feet were on the ground, I was kissing him with everything. He had to reason to be someone, he had a reason to be a fighter not someone who used to excuse of his alcoholic father or dead mother to punch the living daylights out of someone. And as I whispered, 'I'll never leave you, ever,' into his ear, I grinned at the thought that his reason to change might be me. ~VD:T~ 'Do you wanna meet Brendan?' I looked up over my food and stared at my boyfriend blankly. The flickering light of stupid late night television made his face glow and I put my fork down. 'What?' Tommy shifted in his chair and glanced away from me, we had agreed to eat something at his place and although the invitation for me to stay over wasn't obvious, there was no way I was driving back home at 11 at night. Not when my gorgeous boyfriend was nursing bruised knuckles alone and his tight shirt was just so tempting to rip off. 'Brendan. My brother,' Tommy stated as if it were an easy question for me to answer, 'do you want to meet him?' 'Why, did he say something?' 'No,' he shook his head and went back to eating, he was struggling a little and I wasn't making it easier. 'Do you want me to meet him?' My heart soared when he didn't say anything. He wants me to meet his brother. 'I'll meet him,' I clarified and caught his anxious look. 'You will?' 'Mhmm.' I smiled and turned my attention back to the television. That was enough tense conversation for one night- oh no, he wasn't finished. 'Have you spoken to Belle?' My fork clashed on my plate where I'd dropped it and I whipped my head to face him. 'Wh...why? Why? Why do you say that?' Tommy's eyes narrowed a little at my stuttering and he shrugged, 'I figure it's a two way street.' I scoffed and taking my plate into my hands, I stood up and stopped in front of him on my way to his kitchen, 'fuck you Tommy.' Angry wasn't how I'd describe my emotion at the moment. Confused, most certainly. A little betrayed. Disappointed. 'I didn't ask you to meet Brendan because I want to meet Belle.' Tommy sighed when he dumped his plate into the sink too. I was leaning my back against the counter and looking at the ground. I saw his feet and felt his hands on my hips as he pulled my body flush against his. 'I was thinking if I could talk to my brother, you can talk to your-' 'My time,' I said softly and finally met his eyes, 'it's on my fucking time, Tommy. Don't tell me what to do.' 'Affirmative.' Tommy smirked and then he glanced behind him, whisked me off my feet and turned around, 'shall we just sleep together now?' 'I'm actually watching this,' I pointed to the TV with a cheeky smile. Tommy turned so I couldn't see the television and he asked. 'What movie is it then?' I paused and feigned thinking. 'An old black and white one, the woman has a white dress,' I caught his knowing smile and continued anyway, 'it's my favourite film.' Tommy rolled his eyes and barged into the bedroom ignoring my fake protests. He had taken off his shirt before he replied, 'it was America's Next Top Model, Lana,' and shut the door behind him. Short chapter but fairly sweet, right? I'm sorry I've been a little MIA lately. I've had a lot of work to do and I've kinda gotta think about where I want this story to go. I got a few ideas from people asking me to bring his family in. Brendan will be in this story :) Don't worry, I think he's brilliant. Erm, also, I got complimented on my diverse music taste, thank you so much. Thank you to everyone who has reviewed too. We're almost at 100 people! Song is Don't Go by Bring Me The Horizon.[Chapter 19] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : remember when we made love in roses, thank God for you - we are the lucky ones dear : Chapter 18: Brendan, Tess & the girls Tommy and I hadn't spoken much more about me meeting Brendan. Weeks had gone by, my appointments with Patrick had been shorter and less frequent when he'd constantly call to cancel, his vehement cough along with a promise to reschedule was his usual ending on my voicemail. I was obligated to visit him unexpectedly in four days if he hadn't booked another appointment. If it'd been anyone else, I'd be less likely to be as eager to spring up on someones doorstep, burdening someone like that but this was Patrick Conlon. My boyfriends father and my friend... He was however, talking more with Tommy and I'd noticed Tommy talking more to Brendan. It had been unofficially six months into our relationship counting the months before Sparta when he finally mentioned me. He was on the phone in the hallway of my apartment when he thought I was showering. 'Her name's Alana.' I had stopped towel drying my hair at my name being said and tip toed to my door to peer down the hall to see Tommy leaning against the wall, mobile to his ear. He was talking quietly but I wasn't hard of hearing. 'Yeah,' he laughed, 'she's... amazin'. Shut up Bren. Works with AA - don't even ask, man.' I smiled. 'Pop? Yeah. We don't talk about it. I spoke to him yesterday. Yeah? You wanna meet her?' I put a hand to my chest to calm my breathing and continued getting dressed. That's why me and Tommy were bickering in his car at 6.30AM a week later over directions to Philadelphia. 'He said right at Reyment, Lana.' Tommy took his eyes off the road to tap the map I was holding roughly. I furrowed my brows and hiked it up further in front of my face, I was no good at this, evidently. 'Did not. You told me yesterday to 'keep my eye on the freeway traffic.' There's only one near Reyment and that's left.' The air was warm, blue sky and fluffy white clouds. You'd think it would be a good day. Tommy was getting frustrated and wound his window down. 'The wind isn't gonna tell you where to go,' I said not taking my eyes off the map but saw him shoot me a look in the corner of my eye. I grinned. Tommy pulled into a hard shoulder, dug out his phone and tossed it at me, 'call him.' 'You.' I said shoving it back at him. 'No, you. Guys don't ask directions.' Of course they don't. 'Give me the damn thing,' I snatched it back and dialled Brendans number. It rang twice before someone answered. He didn't have a gruff phone voice like Tommy did. 'Tommy?' 'Urgh,' I rolled my eyes, 'thankfully not. I'm Alana. We need direction help.' There was a pause before the man I assumed was Brendan cleared his throat, 'oh sure. You get lost at Reyment?' We talked directions for a minute or so until he was sure we were on the right track. His tone was friendly albeit a little surprised, he hung up and I could tell he was still a little uncertain whether or not we would make it or whether Tommy would just give up and go home. Tommy had a toothpick in his mouth, an elbow out the window and was looking at me. He looked gorgeous with the sun warming the side of his face, his tribal tattoos sticking out from under the sleeves of his tight black T-Shirt and his light blue jeans. 'Left or right?' 'Neither,' I leaned in the backseat and grabbed a bottle of water, 'we took a wrong turn about ten minutes up. We gotta drive right through Reyment.' Tommy did an effortless U turn and we were back on track. After a calm five minute silence, I glanced at him to see him tapping the steering wheel. 'You nervous?' He didn't take his eyes off the road but he spat out his toothpick, 'more nervous 'cause you're here. Bren's never met... you know.' 'Girlfriends?' The term was a little weird. I was Tommy Conlon/Riordan's girlfriend. Ex soldier gone AWOL, former violent cage fighter, runner up in mixed martial arts championship. Tommy still referred to himself as Riordan as opposed to Conlon. But he didn't seem to mind if anyone slipped up and questioned him calling him Conlon. Not anymore. 'Well there's never really been any.' I laughed out loud at this and hiked my feet up onto the seat, getting more comfortable as I turned, with difficulty due to the seatbelt to face him. 'You can't sit there and lie to me about something like this.' 'Like what?' He glanced at me with a small smile. 'If you didn't have girlfriends, I'm a goddamn hobbit.' Tommy rubbed his lips as he chuckled. 'I didn't call them that.' I caught his drift and did breathed an 'oh' and turned back to face the road. I wasn't put off by the fact Tommy must've had lots of sexual partners before me. But it was always uncomfortable. I mean, I didn't exactly make him work for the prize and I was beginning to feel a little self-concious and embarassed. Perhaps I should've waited longer before jumping the sack with him. Tommy as observant as he diverted his attention between me and the empty freeway before he sighed. 'Lana, you're the first girl I've ever called my girlfriend. Brendan's never met one... officially. I'm nervous.' This made me breathe easier but it still didn't erase my nagging mind from reminding me that I'd slept with Tommy almost the third time I'd met him. 'Don't.' I looked at him to see him gripping the steering wheel, his face was serious when he glanced at me. 'Don't what?' 'Don't regret what we did. I can see you... thinkin' away. Thinkin' what we did was a mistake. I...' he stopped and for a moment I thought he wouldn't continue, but he did, 'I would've came back. Even if we didn't... on that first night.' 'You saying I'm not good in bed, Tommy?' I winked at him to ease the serious atmosphere but caught his scowl. 'You can never take-' '-Anything seriously,' I finished for him with a sigh, 'I know. And I know... you know, I don't regret it. You're too sexy to resist.' Tommy took a sidelook at me and smirked, 'that's the first compliment you've given me.' I couldn't remember if I'd given him one before but I feigned offence. 'I don't see you buttering me up with compliments either. When did a bouquet of flowers ever hurt anyone?' We were laughing as we fake bickered the rest of the way and it made the journey seem shorter. Which was why I was quite disappointed when Tommy pulled into a suburban neighbourhood. The houses were close together with pretty lawns and nice cars. Tommy made a stop outside one of the houses, it was nearing lunch time and my stomach was growling. 'Think they would've made lunch?' Tommy didn't laugh and only stared up at the house before cutting the engine and leaning back. He rubbed a hand through his hair. I caught it before he could lower it and I gripped it in my own, 'you can do this, you know.' 'I've only spoken to him over the phone since...' 'I know, I gave him a reassuring smile, 'but it's a start, alright? After you get this out of the way, it only gets easier.' 'But Tess...' Tommy had filled me in before this visit all about Tess. His brother's betrayal had possibly been the catalyst for Tommy's downward spiral, the death of their mother was the brunt and that was what made Tommy who we used to be. His reunion with his brother however, had been the start of the new 'him.' The him I think I was falling in love with. 'Will be on her best behaviour just like you will.' I gave him one last hand squeeze and opened the door, Tommy following suit. 'You could just intimidate her.' Tommy said coming up behind me, giving my hip a gentle squeeze and he took my hand again. I had a feeling he'd probably let it go when Brendan opened the door but for now, he needed me. 'I think you'll do that on your own.' I knocked once on the door and we waited. Tommy was bouncing on the heels of his feet and I was nervous for the both of us. Then the door opened and we were finally face to face with Brendan Conlon. And Tommy didn't let go of my hand. ~VD:T~ Brendan was tall. Not as tall as Tommy and not nearly as muscled, I had a feeling he'd probably lost a lot of the muscle he had for Sparta since it ended. Considering the guy had money, you couldn't tell by looking at him. He wore a simple grey shirt and slacks. Although I'd seen him before in Sparta, it was new seeing him in the flesh, close enough to touch, knowing this guy was the reason Tommy was the way he used to be, you'd think I'd resent him but I dont make judgements according to other peoples problems with people. 'Tommy,' Brendan spoke first and welcomed us into his home. It was warm and cosy. You could tell he'd splashed a bit of the cash with the way the wallpaper looked fresh, there was a laminate flooring and a few portraits hanging in his hallway. I waited as they hovered between the idea of doing one of those manly hugs. Tommy seemed hesitant but Brendan seemed to think it was necessary and so enveloped his younger brother in an awkward one armed hug since Tommy didn't let go of my hand. Brendan turned to face me and smiled, 'you're Alana. It's nice to meet you.' He stuck out his hand and I took it with a smile. I wasn't uncomfortable around new people, I was more so a little nervous in case I said something wrong. I didn't want to screw this visit up. 'Finally,' I said and nudged Tommy with my hip who was just openly scrutinising his brothers home, he jumped out of his reverie and offered his brother a short smile. Their phone conversations had obviously been the highlight of their building relationship. There was a moment of awkward silence and I could feel word vomit bubbling. I could just imagine myself asking him something along the lines of, 'so where's the homewrecker then?' Instead she, herself, made it known she was still here when she confidently strided into the hallway, a cloth in her hands. She stopped when she saw us and she glanced at her husband briefly. She obviously hadn't been expecting me when she bit her lip awkwardly. 'Oh,' she said and Tommy turned to face her, his grip on my hand a little tight, 'I didn't know you were bringing someone Tommy. Brendan, you didn't say anything.' I couldn't help but look at Brendan incredulously, 'you didn't tell your wife I was coming?' Brendan, a little startled at my open question and his wife's glare shifted his weight and adorably looked toward his younger brother for some help. I felt Tommy's hand on my waist, 'Tess,' he addressed her shortly and I felt his hand lift up to show her our intertwined hands. 'This is Alana, my girlfriend.' Tess was pretty. Blonde and a little petite but her overall presence was domineering and put me on edge. She made it very clear just in the way she stood that when you're in her house, you follow her rules. 'I made food,' she said almost trance like and I rolled my eyes at this mishap. She noticed and offered me a smile, 'no matter. Enough to go round.' I could sense another awkward silence but decided to break it, 'you got a nice hall and everything Brendan but, mind showing us somewhere else?' Brendan laughed a little and nodded, 'sure.' After a brief and quite casual conversation in their living room, with Tess coming in and out while she prepared the food, she finally stood at the doorway and stated that food was officially ready. The table was set for four and I took my seat next to Tommy. The meal was nothing particularly special, chicken ceasar salad and a selection of dressing. I was starving and didn't hesitate to begin eating. Again, conversation was brief and I noticed that the subject of fighting was carefully avoided. 'So, Alana,' Tess took a sip of her drink across the dinner table, 'you're not from here I'm assuming.' 'England,' I said with a polite smile, 'I'm the Princess of Wales.' There was a short pause and my expression obviously made it clear that I was joking because their gullible looks was slowly replaced by laughter. 'How'd you and Tommy meet?' Tommy was eating away and didn't say anything. I noticed he directed most of his conversation at his brother leaving me to talk with the pretty blonde. 'Through work. I work in Alcoholics Anonymous.' 'Tommy said,' Brendan cut in, 'that's a... weird profession.' 'Drunk people always do make the best conversationalists.' I said and cursed myself in my head. I wasn't helping myself. I was digging myself a huge fucking hole. Tess laughed awkwardly and poured more drinks before she decided to ask another question, 'so you know Paddy then?' Tommy looked up now, 'what is this, fifty questions?' 'Tommy,' Brendan warned and I took his hand underneath the table giving him a reassuring squeeze. Tess didn't waver though and continued to look at me expectantly. I was beginning to sense she was testing me or something. Wanting to see how much I really knew Tommy or something. 'Mhmm,' I nodded and leaned back in my chair, 'he's lovely.' I watched Tess exchange a look with her husband before she gathered our plates, she didn't leave the table yet though. I expected that. 'Didn't used to be so lovely.' She muttered. 'Nor did Tommy,' I deadpanned, 'but he's here sitting with you in your house eating your food and being civil to you even though he doesn't actually like you much.' I realized a little too late I may have overstepped my mark. The men seemed surprised at our little argument but Tess just smiled and if I wasn't mistaken, she was a little impressed. 'You're not afraid to speak your mind,' she addressed and nodded, 'I respect that.' 'Thank you,' I said nonchalantly as I raised my glass to my lips. 'But I'd like to make something clear. In my home, it's my way or I'll show you to the door. If you two can understand that, I'm sure we will have a wonderful afternoon. Clear?' 'Crystal.' I downed my drink and smiled, we'd come to an understanding. ~VD:T~ We were sat in the garden after the meal on some deck chairs. Brendan and Tommy were sat a little further away as Tess and I engaged in some more lighter, girl talk. After the little interaction at the dinner table, I'd come to respect the woman and I'd like to think she respected me enough too to know I wasn't going to put up with her 101 personal and relationship questions. 'Have you spoken to Paddy recently?' I shook my head and watched Tommy from a distance as he talked with Brendan. Whatever Brendan had said, Tommy had found amusing. 'I have to visit him in four days or I'll lose my job.' Tess nodded and followed my eyesight towards the man who had so obviously captured my attention. 'Tommy and you serious?' I looked at her now, 'what you do you mean?' She shrugged, 'when he was a kid and I was hanging around with Bren, he was always so violent. Punching anyone who got in his way. He scared off all the boys, broke all the girls' hearts. And then Sparta-' 'Was a long time ago,' I clarified and looked back at Tommy who was showing Brendan something on his phone. 'He's changed.' 'I can't argue with you there. I never thought that he'd-' 'What?' I got defensive, 'be able to have a civilised conversation with his father and his brother?' 'No,' Tess grinned, 'bring a girl to meet his brother.' Oh. Before I could say anything else, a girly squeal echoed around the house and we all turned around to see a girl in a white flowly skirt come running out of the glass screen door and into the garden. She was panting and laughing hysterically before she noticed there were four sets of eyes on her. 'Oh...' She was a pretty girl and she looked like her parents. I was beginning to wonder where the girls were. 'Emily, why don't you go back inside, alright?' Brendan ushered the small girl but she stood her ground and scowled at her dad. 'Rosie's annoying. Who are they?' She had tried to ask quietly but Tommy and I had heard and Tess went to scold her daughter for being rude before I stood up and held my hand out to the small girl. 'Hey, I'm Alana. You're Emily, right?' The small girl looked perplexed before looking at my hand then at her mother before she limply shook it and nodded. Tommy hung back but before long I saw him slowly approach until he was stood behind me, he put a hand on my hip and looked at the girl as if she had two heards. Brendan noticed. 'Tommy, I was gonna wait before you met them.' 'No,' I said brightly, 'he's fine.' I glared at him until he got the message and crouched down so he was eye level with the girl, he offered a hand as well, 'I'm Uncle Tommy.' 'My uncle?' Emily asked as she shook his head, a little more confidently than my own. She seemed to be okay with this new family member before she looked back at me. 'You talk weird.' What is it with these Americans and me talking weird? 'It's annoyin' aint it?' Tommy asked her jokingly and the girl laughed before she shook her head. 'No, it's pretty. You sound like One Direction.' OH PLEASE SHOOT ME. I waved my hand at her dismissively, 'they're my brothers.' She stopped her laughter suddenly and I could see her parents stifling their laughter. She looked at me and then hauled my hand down so that I was crouched beside Tommy, he put a hand around my waist to steady me and the small girl who had grown very serious looked at me. 'Are they seriously?' I shook my head, suddenly feeling a little guilty for messing with the girl but she breathed a sigh of relief and smiled, 'Auntie Alana's funny.' There was a small tense moment as we just realized she'd addressed me as Auntie and I went to quickly correct her when Brendan sneakily ushered the girl inside with the promise of ice cream leaving Tommy and I on our knees in the garden looking at eachother as if we both wanted to ground to swallow us whole. Really sorry for the delayed chapter. It isn't as long either but I'm getting there, alright? Please bear with me. I've also reached 100 reviews! After only 18 chapters! Everyone who has reviewed please treat yourself to some chocolate or a new bra or something. Song is Lucky by Bif Naked. It's a song I've been listening to a lot recently and although it doesn't really fit with the chapters, I really like the song with the tone of this chapter, slow and steady and just a really nice sound to it. Anyway, 1st of December! OHHHMAAAAAGAAAH![Chapter 20] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me, all the roads that lead you there are winding - you're my wonderwall : Chapter 19: My Good Ol' Friend Patrick Tommy and I left shortly after with the excuse that time wasn't on our side and we needed to get back to Pittsburgh. Tess did slip in about a work thing for Brendan, apparently it was a formal event and Brendan was allowed to bring guests, namely Tommy and me. I drove on the way back, the dusk was setting in and I couldn't help but feel awkward. What Emily said was completely innocent, right? I mean, the girl practically hinted marriage but we weren't there yet. I think Tommy's only called me his girlfriend once. I was so deep in thought I didn't hear Tommy mumble something. 'What?' He looked at me and narrowed his eyes, 'I said, you missed our exit. You alright?' 'Yeah,' I answered quickly and nodded, preparing for a U turn. 'Yeah, I'm fine.' I heard him sigh and got defensive. 'What was that sigh for?' He put a hand through his hair and I glanced at him with a scowl. He didn't say anything and an awkward silence fell upon us until I was squirming in my seat resisting the urge to just blurt it out myself. Thankfully, he spoke first. 'I've never done this.' 'Done what?' Our tones were softer now but there was a hint of something a little bit eager in them. We both wanted this out of the way, knowing this conversation had to be done and what better time than another three hours in the car together? 'This,' he gestured to me, 'talk. The 'where are we headin' Tommy?' talk.' I rolled my eyes, not sparing him a look anymore. The roads were near enough empty and I was wishing they weren't so that my attention was distracted. 'Then don't.' I scoffed and finally spared him a long look, he was watching me curiously but confused, 'I'm not expecting you to drop to one knee, Tommy. I'd say no if you did. But it doesn't hurt to address me as your girlfriend now and again. That's what I am, right?' He nodded and I turned my attention back to the road. I didn't mean to say it but I needed to end this nagging feeling in my chest. I swallowed and gripped the steering wheel, 'besides, I think I love you.' I heard his intake of breath and didn't look at him for the long while he was silent. Most times when things come out of my mouth due to word vomit, I regret them within a second. What I had confessed to Tommy wasn't one of those times. I didn't regret what I said, even if he dived head first out of the car window right now. 'You don't have to say it back,' I said cutting through the tension. I couldn't look at him and was thankful when I saw other cars come into focus up ahead. He didn't say it back. ~VD:T~ It was a bright Tuesday morning and I was heading to Patrick's house. Neither me nor Tommy had said anything more about my little heart to heart and I was beginning to suspect that he wanted to completely erase it from his memory. I didn't have time to think about it at present though, I had work. I knocked on the door and waited. I brushed away invisible fluff on my grey cardigan as I heard shuffling and coughing from the other side of the door. Patrick answered it, he was dressed in a white vest that hung loosely on his skinny body and slacks that seemed to be held up by a very clumsy belt. His hair was flat against his head and his eyes looked tired. He was holding a tissue to his mouth while he continued to cough and I caught his surprise when he saw it was me. For a moment, his hand latched onto the door as if he was going to slam it in my face but eventually, he stepped aside and granted me entrance. I took my usual seat in his living room and waited for him to sit himself on the sofa. He didn't. He hovered by the door and looked uncomfortable. 'Hey then,' I said jokingly, 'wanna sit down, Patrick?' His eyes met mine in some kind of desperate plea. Only it wasn't the kind of look you give when you need help, it was the kind of look you give when you want someone to leave. He very slowly took a seat on the very edge of the sofa and I put my bag beside me. Instead of going around my usual regime and getting his file, I just sat silently. Letting him know I wasn't going anywhere. 'Can I get you a drink?' I asked him gently. He turned his gaze to his feet and shook his head, 'you're the guest.' 'And your friend.' I said seriously and felt this was one of the times I should get over myself and I gingerly sat beside him. I watched him tense for a moment then when I put my hand on his shoulder, he relaxed slightly. 'What's wrong?' He laughed but it came out wheezy. 'Drink takin' it's toll on me, darlin'.' I felt my chest get heavy. This was common in alcoholics. Shit immune system damaged by drink made them vulnerable to illness. A simple cough and cold could turn them into dead men overnight. He removed the tissue from his mouth and I looked away when I saw red splattered on it. I got up and shot him a smile, 'tea?' I didn't wait for his reply before I shot into the kitchen. Stop thinking of yourself and your damn issues, your friend needs you. Making tea isn't the longest chore and there was only a matter of time before I'd have to make another appearance. It made my throat close up seeing him like it, my eyes watered a little bit at the time I'd taken for granted with him. The times we'd go fo coffee and all I wanted to do was leave. My visits with him had been strictly work orientated and sometimes the rare occassion we'd talk about Tommy. I brought in two mugs and sat beside him. He was laying lazily on it, his back slumped down against the back and I saw him stuggle to get back up, it looked as if he'd built a pyramid with the amount of effort it seemed to take him to just take a single sip of his tea. I fiddled around with my phone in my pocket. Should I call Tommy? 'Patrick, is there someone you want me to call?' I asked softly afraid the loudest sound would startle the life right out of him. I took the opportunity as he sipped his tea to look around his living room, it looked tidy. Too tidy as if he hadn't stepped foot in it in days. Dust covered most of the surfaces even the coffee table where he'd usually rest his feet. He shook his head in answer to my question and I placed my tea on the table before excusing myself to his bathroom. Tentively, I bypassed the bathroom and quickly found Patrick's bedroom. The intrusion I was knowingly committing wasn't registering in my head and it certainly disappeared as soon as I saw the state of it. A plastic wash bowl was led beside his bed and the smell told me he'd thrown up several times in it. His bed wasn't made and there was a mixture of what looked like sweat and blood covering his pillow. The curtains were drawn right across not allowing any sunlight. I backed out with a deep breath and wiped my eyes when I felt moisture. Patrick... I sat in the hall and closed his bedroom door to stop the smell and cradled my phone in my hands. Should I or shouldn't I? 'Fuck it.' I dialled the number I had on speed dial and he answered within the first ring. I had been sat in the living room with Patrick for ten minutes watching as he seemingly slept. His chest was rising and falling steadily with the slight hitch now and again, he was resting against the sofa and I'd moved myself to the armchair to give him room. He had been sleeping when I came back downstairs. I tidied our mugs and his untouched tea and waited. A single knock later and I shot out into the hall to answer it. Tommy stood there, he was wearing jeans and a tight black T-Shirt, his car was in the driveway beside mine, his fists were still bandaged up, he was obviously in the middle of training. The thought that he didn't even spare time to take them off told me he was just as eager as I thought he'd be to help his father. 'Where is he?' He asked. I gestured to the living room and Tommy stepped in, took my hand and we walked in together. Tommy and I stood at the doorway and looked on as he slept. He rubbed a hand over his face, 'he seems fine.' Taking a step back I led him up the stairs and showed him his dads bedroom. We stopped outside the door and I let go of his hand. 'What's wrong?' 'I cant...' I swallowed and braced myself against the wall, 'I can't go in there again.' I saw Tommy begin to look concerned and I counted three seconds before he came back out and slammed the door behind him. He was leaning against it, I went to approach him but didn't have time when he bolted into the bathroom and threw up. As I waited, I leaned against the wall and felt my eyes begin to water again. Even when I knew Tommy was done and had finished washing himself up, he didn't leave the bathroom. I didn't want him to. We both needed time to register this information. Patrick Conlon was dying. It was a good twenty minutes before Tommy emerged and when I thought he was going to walk right past me, he just threw his hands around me and hugged me tightly. I wound my arms around his neck and buried my head in the crook blowing softly on the skin under his jaw. I felt him relax a little bit. I don't know how long we stood there before I unwound myself, 'what do you wanna do?' Tommy chuckled humourlessly, 'you know, the days I'd wished for this day. When I was watching ma down with her holy water while he was drinkin' himself into a fuckin' rut.' 'Tommy,' I breathed. His grey eyes bored into mine and I watched his wall break, all of his defences he'd had up since he was twelve to help him survive the brutal abuse and lack of affection delivered from his father were crumbling. Since Sparta, they'd talked regularly. As if finally, after all of this time, Tommy was beginning to finally forgive Patrick for his mistakes. 'Lana,' he cast a look down the stairs, 'I don't want him to die.' Tommy didn't cry. He didn't give any indication he was going to. But he fell to his knees and in that moment, his last internal struggle against the forgiveness for his dad was over. 'I know baby,' I gathered him in my arms and he rested his head against my stomach. 'We will help him,' I soothed and ran my hand through his hair. I had no idea what I was saying, anything to soothe both of us but the intention was simple. It was time to show Patrick how much his family cared about him. Alright, I missed Patrick and felt the need to bring him back. Not in the most flattering way I know. Anyway, hope you guys are still sticking with me through this. I didn't get many reviews for the last chapter although I did hit 109 reviews. I hope you guys know that I appreciate each and every single one of you. If you want recognition or something in a chapter then drop me a message with your name (or tell me to use your username) and I will, just let me know :) Song is Wonderwall by Oasis.[Chapter 21] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : you take the breath right outta me, you've gotta fight just to make it through 'cause I will be the death of you : Chapter 20: I Technically Didn't Steal Tommy's Car 'What does that mean?' Tommy wasn't the easiest person to talk to. Especially when you're the bearer of bad news and he doesn't like what you're saying. Dr Greene looked sheepish. He wrang his hands on the desk. He was just as fidgety as Tommy and I took his hand in mine. Tommy's obviously. Not the doctors. Gross. 'Tuberculosis is lethal. If left untreated it can prove fatal.' Tommy leaned forward and sniffed, licking his teeth. Putting up a front, I figured. But the state of his father devastated him no matter he can try and deny it with his nonchalant attitude. I cut in. 'Is it treatable?' Dr Greene looked wary but nodded. 'Treatment is...difficult but when sustained can be beneficial and successful.' I cast a look out the window in the screen door to see Patrick being led down on a hospital bed, a nurse was checking his pulse and he struggled to keep his head up. I was brought back into the room when Tommy was raising his voice. 'What the fuck do you get paid for?' 'Tommy,' I warned and sparing me only a glance, he settled into his seat. Dr Greene cleared his throat and seemed to look longingly at the door as if he wanted out of this room ASAP. 'Antibiotics?' I cut in and both men looked at me. 'Injections, etc?' He paused. Tommy then looked at the doctor expectantly as well. 'Frequently administered antibiotics. Takes time and work.' He glanced at my hands, specifically my left, 'do either of you live with Mr Conlon?' I shook my head and Tommy scoffed, 'he can't do it himself?' Looking at him incredulously I asked, 'are you kidding me?' He didn't even look at me. I ran a hand through my hair. 'He didn't mean-' 'I'm just sayin' I don't have time to give up work.' There it was. The front he had to put up around strangers when it concerns showing affection for his dad. 'You don't even work.' 'I get paid.' He bit back. 'For beating people up in a ring? Awesome profession. What qualifications you need for that?' He glared at me and Dr Greene cleared his throat and shifted uncomfortably. He obviously wanted to disappear into the smoke filled, caffeine stocked staff room. 'Sorry,' I smiled wide, 'is moving in mandatory?' 'Mr Conlon is very sick. He can't manage to administer his medication daily. He might forget or overdose.' Tommy tensed and I rubbed his back, our previous lovers tiff forgotten. Grinning I slapped Tommy on the back, hard, 'call us roomies.' ~VD:T~ As we prepared to leave, a hospital assistant was helping a fragile Patrick into the back of Tommy's car. Tommy and I hovered by the doors for a moment longer. 'His...' Tommy swallowed and caught the attention of Dr Greene who was handing me Patrick's prescription. 'he used to drink. Alot. Can that...' Dr Greene nodded. I winced. 'Alcoholism is proven to be a main cause of TB, yes.' Tommy looked away and slammed his hand against the glass door. It jerked and both me and the doctor jumped. 'Mr Riordan...' Tommy stormed away and I sighed. 'I got it.' He was pacing by his car when I reached him. Patrick sat quietly, half laying half sitting in the back seat, his eyes were closed and he was breathing slowly. I thanked the assistant and waited until he disappeared inside before I slapped Tommy on his bicep. It was nearing evening and the carpark was empty. 'Don't do this.' He scowled and leaned against the car. 'Do what?' Always plays this stupid game. 'Forget he's your father. He's sick Tommy.' 'Whose fault is that?' He narrowed his eyes at me as if I was the villain in this mind game of his. I pursed my lips, 'at the house you told me you didn't want him to die.' His posture softened momentarily, 'he won't. Not if you stay with him and forget this.' He didn't move a muscle and I shook my head absolutely bewildered at his change in attitude. 'Alright, give me your keys.' I held out my hand. Furrowing his brows my boyfriend asked, 'what?' 'You heard me.' He fumbled in his pockets before putting his keys in my hand. 'What for?' I didn't answer him and instead, rounded the car and got in the drivers side. Tommy reached for the passenger door but I leaned over and locked it before he could open it. I started the engine ignoring the rather forceful taps against the window. Winding the window down, he poked his head in. 'Can I help you?' I asked sweetly. 'What the fuck are you doin' Lana?' 'Being a friend.' 'You're my girlfriend.' He growled. My stomach flipped and I looked down, 'before my dad left, he tried to kill himself with vodka and ibuprofen. Didn't stop me working in AA or helping your dad.' Tommy braced his arms on the car, 'you had no choice to work in AA. You're stuck in a dead end job and Pop probably complimented you. Did your daddy slap you about?' I widened my eyes in utter shock at his words and stamped on the gas, 'fuck you Tommy.' And off I sped. ~VD:T~ I'd been at Patrick's home for an hour before the prick of the season stepped through the door. He looked tired and... guilty? I stopped at the bottom of the stairs and silence fell between us. I fiddled with the packet of pills in my hand and stepped down the last step. Tommy broke the silence. 'Where is he?' 'Upstairs.' I sat down on the foot of the stairs and Tommy slowly made his way to sit beside me. 'What I said-' 'Doesn't matter.' I offered him a small smile, it didn't reach my eyes and it must've looked more sad that I thought because Tommy wrung his head and tentively reached out with his hand to place it on my thigh. 'What did you study?' 'Sorry?' 'At University.' I grinned, 'psychology.' He nodded, might I say he looked a little impressed, 'you're good at your job. Even if you don't like people.' I laughed and put my head on his broad shoulder, 'you can do this, y'know.' 'Look after Pop or forgive him?' 'Both. You already forgive him, all this' I tapped his built chest, 'is just front. Call Brendan?' 'Yeah. Had an hour to kill, my girlfriend stole my car.' Vicious coughing from upstairs jerked us and Tommy sprinted up the stairs before I could even stand up. I decided to leave them alone and placed the pills on the kitchen counter. I began cleaning up a little and before long, Tommy appeared at the living room door. 'He okay?' He nodded slowly. 'I can move back in.' 'Good.' 'If you do.' I stopped what I was doing and did a double take at him, 'excuse me?' He leaned against the door, crossing his arms across his chest, 'be a live in carer for him or something. I still got my training to do.' 'I have a job too.' 'Do both.' I flopped on the armchair, 'this wasn't the best preposition of asking me to move in with you.' Tommy widened his eyes a little, obviously he hadn't thought about it like that. 'I didn't mean-' 'I know,' I stood, crossed the room and kissed him chastely on the lips, without me being on my tiptoes he was significantly taller than me and I head to raise my head to meet his eyes, 'besides, we gonna sleep in that single Action Man quilt bed of yours?' Tommy paused, 'we should move your bed in here.' 'Mmm,' I kissed him again and smiled. Sorry for the delay, guys. Hope you like this chapter even though it's short. Christmas soon. Song is Breath by Breaking Benjamin - it doesn't match Lana as much, but Tommy for sure. Thank you to everyone who is reviewing. I was thinking to responding to any reviews in the next chapters, so any questions or queries and I can answer them in the next chapter :)[Chapter 22] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : what do we do when I am so in love with you; if I just save you then you could save me too : Chapter 21: I Love You's Are For Romantics & Movies 'Would you try lifting it, Lana?' I stuck my tongue at him and struggled under the weight, 'I am!' Tommy heaved again and I tried not to get distracted by the muscles in his arms, he was clad in a black vest and jeans only. I'm a woman and those tattoos were my God - RIPPLING. 'Lana!' I yelped as the bed went crashing to the floor and I winced as it chipped the wall a little bit. We were stranded at the top of the stairs, my massive double bed blocking the stairway and the door where it supposed to go. Risking a glance at him, Tommy sighed and scratched his head. 'Your fault.' 'Yeah,' I said not even denying it, 'but I was distracted.' 'Oh yeah? By the amount of weight you weren't holding?' 'Yeah and these,' I showed him my red hands, 'are from jacking you off.' He winced and cast a look downstairs, shit his dad was downstairs. 'Oops.' I giggled a little and sat on the bed carefully so it wouldn't topple down the stairs, I wiped down my sheets and huffed. 'Why did I agree to move my bed out of my apartment again?' 'You're living here,' Tommy said as if it was obvious and braced his arms on either side of me leaning down to kiss my lips. I smiled, 'I feel commitment.' Tommy paused and I felt he was about to back up, I took his neck in my hands and he rested his head in the crook of my neck. 'I'm kidding.' I felt him breathe in and out before he raised his head to look into my eyes, 'don't you think it's a little overrated?' 'What is?' He hesitated and looked away, 'the words.' The words, wow, was I going out with a ten year old? 'I hear they refer to 'the words' as Voldemort in Thailand.' I rolled my eyes and made him look at me, I put my hands on his shoulders and laughed incredulously, 'seriously?' 'Don't laugh at me, Lana.' He looked genuinely hurt. Did he struggle this much with just three words? I lowered my voice, 'it wasn't easy for me y'know.' Tommy looked about to say something, probably argumentative, defending himself so I cut him off, 'not only saying it but you not saying it back.' 'Doesn't mean I don't.' He said quickly and silence fell among us. So he did love me? I resisted a grin and whispered, 'I love you.' His grey eyes widened momentarily before he covered my lips with his own, delving into depths saved only for him, that familiar shiver taking over my senses. Moaning into the kiss, I felt his arms envelope me before he was laying me down on the bed. I felt my body dip before Tommy stayed very still. 'The bed,' he said and my stomach flipped. If we moved anymore, the bed was going to slide down the stairs. Tommy was trying to keep his weight on his forearms so he didn't crush me but I could tell it was getting uncomfortable. I tutted at him, 'it's like press-ups, isn't it?' He laughed under his breath, strain coming through his voice, 'I'm fine.' I dared not look behind me, glimpsing down the steep stairs and instead looked around Tommy to see if I shifted my body outward, it would probably even the beds weight and save us. I smirked to myself. 'Tell me you love me, Tommy.' He looked down, his arm nearly giving out, 'what?' I took his face in my hands and kissed him, 'tell me you love me.' I leaned back and the bed dipped even more, Tommy took a sharp intake of breath and groaned under the pressure his arm muscle was having to go through. 'Lana...' 'You can blame it on the fact I'm basically threatening our lives if you want,' I muttered. 'Youre...' Tommy shifted, 'not really threatening our lives.' 'So tell me you love me then.' There was a moments silence, the tense wait as I impatiently anticipated what Tommy would do. He looked at me, 'I love you.' My heart did somersaults and my stomach fell into my ass as I smiled and completely losing myself, I reached out knocking us both off balance and as we kissed, the bed went sliding down the stairs crashing into the wall at the bottom but we didn't even care. There you go, a reviewer asked for a fluffy chapter. Was that fluffy enough? I'm no good at fluffy chapters, I'm more action driven with just a hug now and again, haha. Hope that was okay, guys. I got a LOT of reviews for last chapter, thank you so much. I can either post this weekend to tide you over for Christmas or... because I love you much, post at 00.01 on Christmas Day :) I wish it was Christmas in the story, that would be so festive![Chapter 23] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : baby you're all I've ever needed, I let them take me down, tell me it's not my fault : Chapter 22: Project Living With Tommy Not that I expected him to but Tommy didn't say I love you often. In fact, since two weeks ago when he'd told me for the first time he'd only said it once more but I was beginning to realize when Tommy said something, it mattered. Unlike my mindless boggling talking, when he spared you a single moment to address you or ask you a question, it was important. It was always for a cause. We went together quite well. Patrick wasn't getting better but he wasn't getting worse which we were considering a good thing. If Tommy wasn't around to give him his pill, I was and vice versa. Tommy was still training at the gym and I was surprised to find out Frank Campana was his trainer now. Brendan had recommended his younger brother to his old trainer a while back but didn't have the guts to tell Tommy until Tommy called him last week to let him know about Patrick. Tommy had said Brendan was visiting this weekend to check up on his dad, it was a nice gesture, but it's always sad to think because of Patrick's declining condition that his sons have finally forgiven him when it might all be too late. 'I was gonna go out this weekend,' I declared, sitting at the kitchen table one evening. Tommy was preparing Patricks pills at the counter and he grunted in reply. 'To give you and your brother some alone time with your dad.' Tommy still didn't say anything and I decided to take that as a confirmation it was a good idea. 'You okay?' 'Is he awake?' He avoided my question expertly and with a sigh I leaned back in my chair glancing down the hall to see the flickering lights of the television from the living room. 'TV's still on.' 'Doesn't mean anythin'.' Tommy mumbled and disappeared to give his dad his antibiotics. Living with Tommy was like living with someone mad of iron in a glass house. He could storm out one second and kiss you on the neck in another but that was Tommy and somehow, I was adjusting to his stoic attitude. I felt his hands on the back of my neck and smiled letting him knead the muscles there, bills lay stacked on the table in front of me and I gasped when Tommy's lips replaced his hands. 'These bills-' Tommy paused and sighed. 'My sponsers can cover them.' He was probably right. Due to Tommy's performance last tournament, his sponsor offers were coming out of his ass. All journalists wanted to know was whether he will be fighting in the Sparta tournament this November. It was months away but the way Tommy had been training lately, it was obvious he was aiming for something higher than small time fights. 'Are you auditioning for Sparta this year?' Tommy took the seat at the table and didn't spare me a look. He just collected some papers in his big hand and pretended to read them. 'How much is this one?' 'Answer my question for once.' His grey eyes flashed but he didn't lash out or say anything hurtful, he just shrugged in his chair. Taking the paper from his hand I scanned it fervently, 'two hundred.' Tommy saw my game. I'd answered his question. He had to answer mine, it was only fair. He paused for a moment, 'I might.' 'Are you gonna tell Brendan?' 'Where are you going this weekend?' He asked quickly. I took a sip of my coffee. 'Out with Kelsie.' Tommy nodded, 'I've already told Brendan.' Which means Tommy made up his mind about Sparta last week for him to tell Brendan. 'Are you going to a club?' 'Probably,' I confirmed confidently, I didn't need his permission to go anywhere, 'do I get a say in whether you do this?' 'No. Do I get a say in whether you go to a club?' 'No.' Silence fell between us, what had started out as a way to get answers from one another had begun to tread on careful relationship issues. Was he allowed to tell me where to go? Was I allowed to tell him what to do? We were living together now, it meant something more than just 'seeing eachother.' 'Be careful,' Tommy eventually muttered, he was staring at me, he meant it. 'I know I don't have to worry about it yet but be careful too. And I wouldn't tell Patrick yet.' ~VD:T~ Weekend arrived quicker than expected and I was getting ready to go out. I was never one for partying or getting drunk, the last time I'd gotten hammered I'd met Tommy - and almost got raped. Brendan was due in an hour and I was hoping to be out the door by the time he arrived, not that I didn't like him but Tommy hadn't gotten around to telling him I live here and he might feel uncomfortable. I was hoping to come home later on tonight with the awkward conversation out the way. Tommy lay on his back on our bed and he watched me as I searched through hordes of clothes in just my underwear. 'You're a perve.' I stated, throwing a black dress back into the closet. 'You're sexy.' I settled on grey skinnies with a white off the shoulder thin shirt and black ankle heeled boots. I wasn't planning on getting drunk, I still needed to be around for Patrick in the morning. 'Is Kelsie picking you up?' Tommy asked as I finished putting on my other shoe, I stood and headed for the mirror without toppling over in front of my boyfriend. 'No, taxi.' 'Don't you dare walk back here alone.' I shot him a look through the mirror and then turned to face him, 'I won't. Are you alright?' He shook his head, 'this is new to me.' 'Being with Brendan?' 'Being protective over my girlfriend going out.' I swallowed and crossed the room to straddle him on the bed. 'I won't be out long, promise. Besides, Kelsie can be a whore, she will probably run off with some guy within the first hour.' His hands gripped my waist, 'promise me you won't walk back here. You get a taxi or call me and I'll pick you up.' I couldn't promise that. Me and Kelsie usually walked back to our apartments because they were close. Now that I'd moved, we'd walk halfway and then go the rest alone, it had never been a big deal. I was saved by the doorbell. 'My taxi.' I gave Tommy a quick kiss and climbed off him shooting him and Patrick a goodbye before getting into the taxi. Phew, I sighed with relief. Sorry for the long wait, guys. I hit Writers Block. I capitalize that because it's horrible. This story has no plot, really. I am trying to incorporate one and hopefully it goes well, stick with me guys? It's short as well. Hope everyone had a great Christmas and it's Boxing Day so hit the sales! Song is All I Ever Needed by Nikki Reed and Paul McDonald.[Chapter 24] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : you say you know love but you are just reflecting words you hear, electricity and wires dictating everything you do; we run around the rules, just behind your eyes there are switches that can turn back on to clear away today, 'til all your memories are gone : Chapter 23: Both Got Our Problems Clubbing was never my thing. Back in England, I'd never gone out clubbing, I was never in the mood for it. Now, I still wasn't. The circumstances were different and through the euphoric pounding of the dubstep, the alcohol running through my veins by the several shots I'd done all I wanted was to go back home and sit on the sofa with Tommy. 'Gotcha whipped.' Kelsie called over the music and smiled as I shot her a look. We were sat at the bar but she was itching to get on the dancefloor to grind with the dark Italian over there. 'Just go.' I didn't have to tell her twice. I sat alone but I didn't mind. I saw a cluster of guys that followed Kelsie as she walked away and when their eyes met mine, I looked down. I heard my name and looked up. 'Ms Jamison?' I was in utter shock. Like when you see a teacher outside of school and they're dressed in a black mini skirt and a pink tank top. Ms Jamison was a whore?! 'Helen.' She ordered a shot of something and I watched in wonder as she downed it. 'But you work at AA.' She shrugged, 'so do you. Isn't stopping you.' Raising my glass of lemonade, she frowned. She didn't have to know I polished off three or four shots as soon as I got here. 'How is Patrick Conlon?' It wasn't a sensitive subject so much for me as it was for Tommy but I appreciated that Jamison had allowed me to be a live in carer. 'Fine. Getting there.' Kelsie tumbled to the bar and spotted Ms Jamison, she was instantly sober and straightened up as she attempted to act a little professional around her boss. It didn't last long as the Italian wrapped his arms around her petite body and attached his lips to her neck. I laughed into my glass as Kelsie looked about to defend herself and shove the man away until she took in Helen Jamisons outfit. She narrowed her eyes, I knew what she was thinking, we were dressed classier than that and we were almost ten years younger. 'Well I'm gonna go,' I said as I downed my drink and did an awkward wave to Jamison, 'see you Monday.' 'Want me to get the taxi with you?' I could clearly see Kelsie was way more interested in Mr Italian who was becoming a little NC-17 instead of PG-13. 'It's fine,' I said as a guilt took over me, 'I might walk.' ~ VD:T~ It wasn't a long walk back to the house. About fifteen minutes but the area Patrick lived wasn't the best for someone who was unarmed. Pepper spray wise not handgun wise. The air was cold and it was almost eleven at night. The trees were even beginning to look scary. Nobody was around and cars were becoming scarce. Wow, Tommy was right. 'What did I say?' A hand grabbed me around the elbow and I was suddenly jerked into someones chest. I immediately knew who it was, the broad sculpted chest and that familiar smell didn't lie. Tommy. 'I'm sorry,' I peered up into his eyes and saw his grey ones only barely from the moonlight flash. He snorted and took off. For a moment I stayed still but quickly followed. We weren't far from the house. 'You lied.' He said as we walked through the front door. The housey comfy feel surrounded me and the flicker and noise from the television told me Patrick was downstairs. 'Don't start right now,' I muttered and took my jacket off. 'Hey Lana, right?' Brendan emerged from the living room a confused expression on his face. He seemed to throw a look at Tommy but he was looking at me. 'What're you...' I glared, 'you didn't tell him? Tommy shifted and avoided my eyes. Brendan put his arms across his chest and slowly shut the door of the living room behind him. 'Tell me what?' 'I live here, Brendan.' Tommy gripped my forearm and went to pull me into the kitchen but I yanked away from his grip. 'You weren't going to tell him? Were you gonna make up how desperate I was when I got out the taxi that I had to visit you?' I ran a hand through my hair and looked at Brendan who looked very baffled but at the same time, a little mad we were arguing when his sick dad was in the next room. 'Brendan, I live here.' Tommy looked from me to his brother before storming into the kitchen. I followed. 'Why didn't you want to tell him?' 'Why did you lie to me?' I flopped down on the seat and took my shoes off as Tommy braced himself against the counter, his back to me. 'Were you ever gonna tell him?' 'Did you know when you promised me you were gonna walk home?' 'Shut up,' I muttered but he caught it, spinning round and he kicked the kitchen stool that was opposite me. The loud crash made me flinch and the chair went rocketing away. 'What the fuck is your problem? You can't tell me what to do!' Tommy got in my face now, I could see his temper flare, I hadn't witnessed all of it yet and wasn't sure I wanted to. 'What's yours?!' 'Guys, fuckin' quit!' Brendan stormed into the kitchen and put his hand on Tommy's chest, pushing him away from me. He turned to me, 'do you have somewhere to go right now?' 'Yes.' I said defiantly and sitting back down, 'my room upstairs. Because I fucking live here.' I stormed away from them and although I felt bad for probably making Patricks condition worsen while he had to listen to all that, I was mad at myself and with Tommy for not being able to tell his brother how serious we were. Our relationship really would go nowhere. Long time no see. I've been writing my Walking Dead story, sorry! Song is Rules by Jayme Dee, it's perfect for Tommy and Lana's relationship and it's also from the Hunger Games. I got a plot worked out so this was more of a filler chapter, I'm afraid.[Chapter 25] Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph : so don't ask me no questions 'cause I don't cry no wolf; you may think she's quite right but my lover is childlike : Chapter 24: He Couldn't Scare Me If He Tried Brendan was going to be sleeping on the couch so when Patrick was put into bed, Tommy joined me in our bedroom. I was under the duvet hiding the fact I was so mad I hadn't bothered to change out of my clubbing outfit or washed the make up off my face. Tommy sat on his side, his back to me as he tore his shirt away from his torso and I had to swallow hard to resist the urge to stroke his naked back. It was so sculpted, his tattoo's tracing his tan flesh and flicking away in perfect intricate patterns. 'I don't wanna argue with ya.' 'We can't anyway,' I said matter of factly and facing away from him when I saw him turn around to look at me, 'Patrick and Brendan are sleeping.' I heard him sigh and the bed dip with his weight. He hadn't taken off his jeans and was laying on top of the duvet. He didn't reach out to me and I was thankful for that. I wasn't sure if I was ready. Tommy was obviously scared of commitment, he hadn't even told his brother his girlfriend had moved in with him, something was nagging away at my mind though. 'Would you have asked me to move in if Patrick wasn't sick?' I felt him turn his head towards me and I faced him again. He lay on his back, one arm under his head and the other by his side in between our bodies. He stared hard at the ceiling and I took a deep breath and waited patiently. 'Probably not here. In this house.' My heart beat rapidly in my chest, 'but somewhere else?' He grunted in reply and the nod of his head made me believe him. 'So why can't you tell your brother?' Tommy glanced at me and in the darkness of the room I saw his eyes flash with something. I could tell he wasn't about to answer and would instead turn this on me. 'Why can't you talk to your fuckin' sister?' My heart would've stopped if it could. 'I told you,' I whispered, 'she got involved in a bad crowd.' 'Bullshit, Lana. What'd she do?' 'I told you,' I repeated, my voice strangled and I went to turn away from him again but he reached out and took hold of my waist, he lay on his side now. 'You told me you wanna prove them wrong. But if your sis is reaching out to ya, don't that prove she knows that? And wants to make up?' My ringtone interrupted our conversation and I lazily reached over to grab it. 'Hey Kelsie.' Tommy rolled his eyes and lay on his back again. 'Did you get home okay?' 'No,' I said sarcastically, 'I'm talking to you from a rapists basement. He says hi.' I felt Tommy tense beside me and decided to take this elsewhere. I walked quietly down the hall and into the bathroom, taking a seat on the edge of the bath tub I sighed and ran a hand through my hair. 'Did Tommy find out you walked?' 'Yeah,' I answered and my throat constricted, my chest felt heavy, I felt like I was about to cry, 'I don't think I can do this anymore, Kelse.' She seemed to perk up, her sober best friend mode switching on, 'Alana? What's wrong? Did he take it really badly?' I felt bad just talking about this. At what I was actually considering right now. I didn't say anything and Kelsie asked, 'do you wanna leave him?' Did I want to leave him? Did I want to walk right out of Tommy's life just as quickly as I'd walked in? 'I love Tommy,' I said meaning every word, 'but I'm not looking for a relationship where I get a stool kicked across the kitchen just because something doesn't go his way.' Kelsie sighed and I could see her in the living room, sipping on a cup of coffee and running a hand through her hair, 'do you need somewhere to go tonight?' 'I'll call you back,' I said quickly and hung up as Tommy opened the bathroom door without even knocking. He was looking down at me and he looked sad. Neither of us spoke a word until I stood and leaned against the sink as Tommy closed the door and leaned against it, 'Kelsie wanted to know if I wanted to go over there tonight. Spend the night.' Tommy only nodded, I was expecting more of a reaction. 'I'll give you a lift.' 'Tommy,' I reached out and took his hand, 'I don't want to. I know if I go over there it's just the start of us ending, isn't it? A night will turn into two and then you'll call and apologize and we'll make up and then I'll decide I need more space and soon I'm living with my whore friend while you... move on.' 'I can't give you what you want.' He said quietly. His tone and expression was stoic, solid but his eyes were giving him away. The grey was misty, a sure sign he was upset. 'You can.' I put my hand on his bare chest, 'you are.' I leaned up and kissed him gently. 'Tell your brother about me. I'll talk to my sister.' He pulled away and stared hard. 'You will? You'll break your stupid promise to yourself and talk to her if I just go down there and admit to Bren that I love you?' It was a deal I was willing to make. I needed something to convince me to stay. This was it. 'Yes.' Tommy kissed me but didn't give me time to deepen it before he opened the door. 'Tommy,' I whispered harshly and followed him to the stop of the stairs, 'now?' 'Yes,' he took my waist in his and pecking me on my forehead, he put his head on my shoulder, breathing into my neck, 'now.' Another really, really short chapter but I got a lot of feedback from the last chapter and felt I owed it to you guys to give you something a little more. Song is Love is Childlike by Low Anthem. ","Summary":" Warrior Violent Delights: Triumph Tommy Riordan/OC Rating: T - As a reader if you're adverse to any"},{"Movie":"Warrior, 2011","Title":"The Warrior's Way","Author":"love.devil.movies.baby","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7976848","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: In my humble opinion, Warrior was one of the best and most underrated films in 2011. The story telling was wonderful, the script suburb, th e performances moving. And the ending left me wanting more. So I took it upon myself to write an epilogue of sorts. I've inserted a character of my own design to move the plot. I hope you enjoy it. If you do, please feel free to leave a review. Constructive criticism is always appreciated and desired. Disclaimer: I do not own the settings, characters or situations in the movie \"Warrior\". This story is an exercise in creativity only and not to be used for profit in any way. It became a rhythm after a while; the familiar lull of casino sounds, the scent of cigarettes. The acidic smell had stopped bothering me by now. It had faded into the background with the rest of my surroundings: the music, the conversations, and the computerized sound of coins clattering in a dish. I arbitrarily push buttons, barely registering my actions as I jerk the handle down. The lights blink, the wheels spin and a series of sevens flash and wink cheerfully at me. An older woman next to me congratulates me on my win, and I offer her a prefatory smile. The elderly woman's face briefly registers recognition. Acting quickly, I cash out, not even bothering to look at the amount. I flash another smile, collect my ticket and haul off as quickly as my stilettos will allow. My heels click quietly on the low pile carpet. I study the pattern—a tacky design of colored circles and swirls—the words of my boss still echoing in my head. I am not accustomed to failure. As a sports reporter and a woman in a predominately male world, I have developed tough skin early on. It took a certain amount of grit to power into the men's locker room night after night and ignore the bare, masculine bodies around me. You do not get the story by hanging out in the background. You elbowed, clawed and sweet talked your way into an exclusive interview. It was a skill that after 5 years I had gotten pretty damned good at. I was becoming a household name, a fixture on ESPN, a figure seen stationed on basketball courts, football fields and college arenas. I never fail to get the story. Except once. It was not my fault, per se. How was I to know that the star player of the MLB's biggest team would be indicted on steroid charges at the exact moment that I had stepped outside to take a call? That thirty second lapse of time had cost me a vital sound bite and landed me in the producer's office, hands folded in my lap, getting scolded like a teenager in detention. You did not make it to the big show by making mistakes. And this mistake had earned me a one-way ticket to Atlantic City. It is not really so bad. MMA fighting is the up and coming sensation and I am at its biggest event. The only trouble is, I know nothing about it. No statistics, no faces. I barely have a grasp of its rules. And there has been no time to prepare. The rookie reporter came down with pneumonia, so here I am, stuck in a smoky casino in Atlantic City, hoping for something interesting to happen so I can wheedle my way back into familiar territory. I fiddle with my ticket, absent-mindedly going over my game plan. All I need is one story, just one . A Cinderella tale would be best, but I will settle for an upset. There has to be a fighter here with an interesting back story, some harrowing tale of a long road to success. I just have to find him and convince him to talk to me. No problem. I stroll through the casino with some vague notion of cashing out my ticket, noticing that fewer and fewer people are occupying the machines as I get closer to the back wall. I briefly note one man sitting alone, seemingly as lost in thought as I am. Something about him gives me reason to pause. He looks familiar. Quietly I slide into a seat adjacent to him. It takes a moment of scouring my mind before the answer comes to me. This man is Tommy Riordan, the black sheep of the Sparta tournament. I had seen him briefly before the opening ceremonies. He is some sort of internet sensation, a nobody who beat a contender to a bloody pulp in some gym in Philadelphia. Now this is something I can work with. I take a moment to study my target. Dressed down in a dark thermal shirt and jeans he does not look like much. One might assume he is just a kid—some out of towner down on his luck, gambling his last dollar away on the penny slots. Riordan shifts his weight, adjusting the plastic cup on his knee. This shift in his posture sends the muscles under his clothing rippling. In that brief moment it becomes clear to me that this is a man of considerable physical power, a man to be watched. Under the guise of rooting in my purse for change, I chance a glance at his face. He has messy brown hair cut in no discernible style, gray eyes rimmed in long dark lashes, full, pouty lips that belong on a model. He makes himself unassuming in everything from his clothing to his posture; his shoulders hunch forward, his head is bowed. He's shutting the world out. What stands out though is the absence of the bells and whistles the other fighters possess. No cockiness, no tight t-shirt decorated in sponsor logos, no entourage, not even a glimmer that he has any particular feelings about the chance to win 5 million dollars. You could walk right past him and the only thing that might register was that there was a very sad looking individual playing the slots along the back wall. A shuffling of feet startles me from my observations. I quickly turn to my game, focusing on the task of gambling for the first time all night. A man is approaching Riordan like he knows him. I make note of his grizzled appearance and also the familiarity in which he speaks to the fighter seated at the slots. Their exchange seems largely one-sided and I feel myself losing interest. My attention snaps back however, when Riordan thrusts the contents of his cup into the older man's face. A host of coins spills out over the carpet, showering the pair. Riordan is staring at the man the way one might look at a cockroach. It is a look that could make a grown man want to run for cover. I am no exception. In all of my years of dealing with competitors who will say anything to intimidate an opponent, I have never seen a look so full of loathing. It makes me wish I had never taken a seat anywhere near the surly fighter. The older man's back is toward me and I find myself wishing I could glimpse his face. It is hard to judge emotion from the back of a man's head. However, the defeated slump of his shoulders and the sad glance he tosses backwards at an impassive Riordan place me in the older man's corner. I wonder how heartless you would have to be to publically embarrass someone like that. \"Enjoy the show?\" a scratchy voice with a thick Philly accent asks me, every syllable dripping with disdain. I will myself to sink into the carpet and disappear. When the universe refuses to oblige me, I do what I always do when I am nervous. I assume my reporter face. \"Excuse me?\" I ask, coolly sliding another coin into my machine. \"You know, you think you're real slick sweetheart, but I could see you over there.\" Riordan spins in his chair, two imposing arms crossed over his chest. \"Really?\" I ask, eyebrow raised. \"I came over here to play the slots.\" I gesture to the machine, mentally slapping myself for sitting down at a game that featured a large picture of a Persian cat. \"Oh yeah?\" he leans forward suddenly and I flinch, fearful for a moment that he will strike me. Instead, he glances at the winning ticket propped up against my purse. \"200 bucks wasn't enough for you? Thought you'd try your luck at \"Kitty Glimmer\"?\" For once, words fail me. \"I like cats.\" I stutter. This comment seems to coax a smile out of him. Or at least his lips twitch at the corners. \"I think you like fights, Nicole Ryan.\" \"You watch ESPN?\" I ask. \"I've been known to.\" He turns back to his game. \"What else have you been known to do?\" I see my opportunity. \"Not talk to reporters.\" His curt statement seems to mark the end of conversation. I am not going to have that. \"Throw coins in old men's faces?\" I question point blank. \"You've got no idea what the hell you're talking about.\" Riordan does not even blink at my accusation. \"Enlighten me.\" \"And see my story on Sports Center? No thanks.\" He scoffs. \"It's going to be on there either way. Might as well be on your terms.\" \"You threatening me?\" I have his full attention again. \"Of course not.\" I wave my hand as if the whole thing is inconsequential. \"Just trying to get a feel for the enigmatic Tommy Riordan. Care to shed some light?\" \"Not really.\" He stands up, wipes his hands on his jeans. \"You know,\" I hurriedly rise after him, not bothering to cash out of Kitty Glimmer. \"the less you say, the more attention you'll get.\" I shove my purse on my arm, barely remembering to grab my 200 dollar ticket. \"So?\" he is moving off quickly now. \"So,\" I maneuver to get in front of him, \"Give them a little something. Might turn the heat down.\" \"Look,\" he pins me with a glare that could make lesser men shit themselves. \"I didn't come out here for popularity and interviews.\" \"What did you come out here for?\" I am intrigued now. \"To fight.\" Without further preamble he shuffles past me. \"Have a good night Ms. Ryan.\" He calls over his shoulder. \"Cash that ticket.\" I watch him disappear into the elevator, my winning ticket in my hand. I glance down at it, reflecting that if I really want to win big in Atlantic City this Independence Day, I will score an interview with Tommy Riordan.[Chapter 2] Author's Note: Constructive criticism is always appreciated and desired. Disclaimer: I do not own the settings, characters or situations in the movie \"Warrior\". This story is an exercise in creativity only and not to be used for profit in any way. I stare at the flickering image on my computer screen in abject shock. Google has never before failed me so badly. I have tried every search I could think of—Google, Facebook, Twitter, public records, service records, arrests—and have come up completely empty handed. Nothing. It is as if Tommy Riordan is some figment of imagination, an enigma with no past. I suppose that is a story in itself, though not a particularly interesting one. I tap my fingers lightly over the keyboard, formulating another game plan. Everyone has a back story. And if Riordan is not going to volunteer his, then damn it, I will find someone who would. I flip through the program lying on the bed next to me, briefly registering the faces of the fighters. The men who had already been knocked out have been crossed off unceremoniously. Losers got a brief press conference afterwards, a few necessary questions. No one cares who lost, unless the loss was spectacular. I had obtained the necessary sound bites from the fallen fighters, including some footage of Mad Dog Grimes being carried dizzily away from the ring. Grimes had talked a loud game about what he would do once he got a hold of Riordan, and all he got for his trouble was a knock out and bruises and welts the size of eggs decorating his face. Riordan is an animal; a silent killer, moving his way swiftly up the ranks. He is the most interesting fighter by far. And no one knows squat about him. I dive for my purse on the nightstand, desperate for answers. And I know who has them. Gavin picks up on the third ring, sounding for all the world like he would love nothing more than to slap me. \"You know it's three in the morning, right?\" he says in lieu of a proper greeting. \"I need your help.\" I cut straight to the chase. \"This had better be good. You call me the night before the 4th of July and expect me to just drop everything—.\" \"I'll buy you coffee every day for a week.\" There is a slight scuffle on the other end. \"Two weeks. And it had better be good coffee. Not that crap they sell at Starbucks.\" \"Fine. \" I acquiesce. \"I need you to find out about someone for me.\" \"Did you try an internet search?\" his voice drips sarcasm. \"Obviously. He's not on it.\" \"Impossible.\" \"Prove me wrong. His name's Tommy Riordan.\" \"No shit?\" I have Gavin's attention now. \"Riordan's a beast. He's been demolishing guys.\" \"He won't talk to the press.\" I say. \"He's the hottest thing in MMA right now. You should interview him.\" \"I'm trying. He's not exactly an open book.\" I try to keep my irritation level to a minimum. I focus on deep breathing as Gavin goes through some typical male ranting. Riordan, apparently, is becoming a god in the MMA world. He is a war hero, a bad ass. I stop listening at a certain point and instead study my reflection in the mirror on the opposite wall. My cocoa colored skin has a sort of ashen haze over it, a byproduct of the lack of moisture in the casino air. It is no surprise that Riordan is not keen on giving me an interview. It might sound cocky, but I am aware that appearances play a large part in television reporting and that being attractive is an asset. At the best of times, my thick mat of black hair is straightened and curled inward at the ends, dusting just below my shoulders. I always opt for minimal makeup, but now my mascara is smudged under my eyes, rimming the dark orbs in a black kohl circle. I look like a college co-ed after a walk of sham, not the put together reporter I normally am. I decide not to dwell on my haphazard appearance and bring my attention back to Gavin. \"God, if you got an interview with this guy…\" Gavin says. \"I'd be forgiven.\" I tell him. \"And then some.\" \"So help me out.\" \"All right,\" Gavin sounds like he is getting out of bed. \"There's not a lot known about him. Let me dig around a little bit, and I'll call you.\" \"The fights tomorrow. Or tonight, rather,\" I glance at the clock. \"The sooner you hang up, the sooner I can get this done.\" Gavin's trademark sarcasm rings in my ears as I lay down on the bed. I have always had a hard time sleeping in hotel rooms. I am a home body at heart and foreign places do not sit well with my subconscious. But the exhaustion of traipsing about in heels all day, diving between huge, sweaty men to get shots and interviews had finally caught up with me. I try to focus on the task at hand. I have less than 24 hours to get a good story, something of substance. There is no time to rest. Groggily, I weigh my options. I can focus on another fighter as a failsafe, a backup plan in case Riordan does not pan out. I look back at the program and find a picture of a fighter staring up at me: Brendan Conlon, a 30-something whose best days look to be far behind him. He has dirty blonde hair and the kind of face that is not unpleasant to look at, but easily gets lost in a crowd. He is not spectacularly muscular, not terribly imposing and is not even posed in a way that might strike fear into a man's heart. He is almost skinny, and even in his picture he projects an air of neglect. Surprisingly, he does not have an X through his name. I have found my underdog. A quick search of his name yields much better results than Riordan. Conlon is a high school physics teacher, a former UFC fighter and a family man. He will be a good one to interview, and I am willing to bet his people will be clamoring for him to get a little media exposure. I study the picture of Conlon, trying to register why his name sounds so familiar. Absently, I flip through the book, scanning a list of coaches and trainers. A name catches my eye: Paddy Conlon. It might be a coincidence, but still, a lead is a lead. I plug the Irish name into the search engine with my fingers crossed. After scrolling through several pages of results, I am about ready to give up. On a whim, I add the word \"Sparta\" to my search. The result flashes on the screen and I find myself lunging for the program. Paddy Conlon is Tommy Riordan's trainer. I picture the defeated old man from a few hours earlier. There is enough resemblance between him and Brendan Conlon that the question arises in my mind. But why would a relative of Brendan Conlon chose to train a rival, especially one who treats him so poorly? The casino scene plays in my mind. That is certainly not how I imagine fighters treating their coaches. There is too much familiarity in that exchange, too much emotion. Following a hunch, I search Tommy again, but add the name Conlon. Google does not fail me this time. My eyes fly across pages of information. Paddy Conlon is Tommy's father. He'd coached him very successfully in high school to several championships. Then there was a period of years where the trail ran dry. I glance through Tommy's service records. Holy shit. \"Gavin?\" I am back on my phone in the blink of an eye. \"I found something. Something big.\" Here is the story I have been looking for.[Chapter 3] Author's Note: Constructive criticism is always appreciated and desired. Disclaimer: I do not own the settings, characters or situations in the movie \"Warrior\". This story is an exercise in creativity only and not to be used for profit in any way. A few hours later, I am showered, reasonably rested and have an attack plan. I have arranged for ten minutes with Brendan Conlon after his first match of the day. Conlon is scheduled to fight the front runner in Sparta, a Russian powerhouse named Koba. Even with my limited knowledge of the sport, I know he has a snow ball's chance in hell of winning. Still, I hope for the best for him. A win means a good story. I stand with the rest of the reporters, watching the fight happen. It is a David and Goliath tale at its finest. I give Conlon brownie points for not pissing himself as he steps into the ring. He looks calm, like a hulk of a man isn't practically growling at him from ten feet away. Conlon's trainer is keeping him focused, playing Beethoven. I scan the audience, my eyes landing on a blonde woman in the second row who is waving and blowing Conlon kisses. I have not seen her all weekend, but Conlon looks at her like the sun is shining out of her hair. His wife, if I had to guess. I make a mental note to try to talk to her later. The fight lasts longer than anyone anticipated. I pride myself on the ability to be relatively objective when watching sports. But watching Conlon take beating after beating is proving difficult. He is absorbing punches like a sponge absorbs water. His face is a road map of cuts and bruises, his features difficult to distinguish with all of the swelling. His wife looks like she is close to biting her fingernails down to nubs. I sympathize, praying for an end to the bloodbath. It comes in the form of a tap out. It is Koba, caught in a web of limbs, who pounds on the mat. The arena explodes. A miracle win, the announcers shout. A Cinderella story come true. The physics teacher is going to the finals. I corner Conlon in the locker room, shoving other reporters back until I make contact with his coach. I have secured the first interview. Jealous glares from other reporters chase my retreating form into a back room where Conlon is being patched up. His wife is a ball of nervous energy at his side, looking at once relieved, elated and terrified. \"Congratulations,\" I offer a smile as my cameraman sets up beside me. \"You're going to the big show.\" Conlon nods, still dazed from the emotion of it all, and I am sure, from the blood loss. \"So tell me,\" I maneuver my mic into position. \"We've heard a lot from the other fighters here, but nothing from you. You've silently defeated men who were sure they were going to make short work of you.\" You can hear a pin drop in the room; every eye is on Conlon and I. \"What's motivated you?\" \"My family.\" The answer is so genuine, sweet in its simplicity. I find myself moved firmly into Conlon's corner. \"It's always for them.\" A bloodied hand reaches out and he grasps his wife, who appears to be crying. We go through the basics, a few questions about his teaching career, a short but moving story about his daughter's health struggles and his struggles to provide. Brendan Conlon is the American dream, a hard worker, an underdog scraping his way to success. \"You're fighting Tommy Riordan tonight.\" My statement sucks the air out of the room like a vacuum. \"His coach is Paddy Conlon; any relation?\" I mean for the question to be a sort of joke. But Conlon glances suddenly at his wife. Even his trainer looks worried. I let the silence permeate, still waiting for my answer. Finally, Conlon clears his throat. \"My father, yeah.\" I quickly regroup, pushing the thousand thoughts that rise up at his response to the back of my mind. \"You father is coaching another fighter? Not you?\" \"He's always coached Tommy.\" Conlon answers calmly. \"You know Tommy Riordan?\" the shock is apparent in my tone. \"He's his brother.\" The answer comes not from Conlon, but from his wife. She is standing there, eyes wide. All at once, I am being forced from the room. Before I know what happened, Conlon's trainer has me on the wrong side of the door. I briefly hear some half-assed apology, something about Conlon needing to prepare, before the door is shut in my face. But I have what I need. I haul back upstairs, desperate for my computer. The raw footage is uploaded and sent to ESPN headquarters before I have even fully processed it. Brothers. Brothers fighting each other for 5 million dollars. My phone buzzes. Gavin yells something into the receiver. \"What?\" my head is swimming. \"Turn on the television, for God's sake!\" Gavin sounds panicked. I fumble with the remote, mashing the buttons until I get to CNN. \"He deserted.\" Gavin tells me the story as I listen to it unfold on the television. \"His whole crew killed in friendly fire. Jesus…this is big. You have to get him before military police do.\" I don't even bother turning the television off. I run, my cameraman Nick in tow, down the halls of the hotel, banging down doors and looking for Tommy Riordan. People direct me, tell me to turn right, go down four doors, second on the left. I pound on the plywood door of room 425, praying someone will answer. I get an answer, but it is not Tommy. The grizzled old man, Paddy Conlon, looks a little worse for the wear. I cannot get a straight answer out of him. He is obviously hungover, possibly still drunk. He seems confused, asking where his boys are. I feel the sudden, sick swoop of pity punch me firmly in the gut. I vow to come back and check on this man. But I have to find Tommy. Back in the locker rooms I finagle my way to Riordan's room. The news has not broken quite yet, but it is only a matter of time. The changing room is empty, and I feel my hear t sink. Nick offers some sort of empathetic pat, suggests we check back upstairs. Then a door in the back opens and Tommy Riordan shuffles in. He looks surprised, opens his mouth to say something. \"I know.\" I cut him off. \"I talked to Brendan. I talked to Paddy.\" There is another long silence. I reflect that my strategy might not be the best under the circumstances. Riordan is capable of beating me to death, and he looks as though he is contemplating it. \"CNN ran a story on you. On what you were doing in Iraq.\" I continue. He purses his lips, shifts his weight. \"You heard the whole story?\" \"Your friend's widow was on the news. She told them.\" \"They're coming?\" he looks like a child. I know he is referring to the police. Guilt seeps into me. I did not contemplate the ramifications of digging into this man's past. And even though it was not technically me who broke the story of him deserting, I feel responsible. \"Probably. And soon, I won't be the only one who knows.\" I swallow hard. I have this one chance to sway public sympathy in his direction. We stare at each other, me silently willing him to agree. \"Fine. I'll talk to you.\" One thick finger points directly at me. \"No cameras.\" Nick and I exchange eye contact. He nods, moves out of the room. Tommy is already seated on a bench, watching me expectantly. \"Well?\" his voice is hard. He hunches on the bench, his shoulders rolled forward, his hands clasped in his lap. I fumble for a notebook and my recorder. It has been a while since I interviewed the old-fashioned way. I hit \"record\" position the device between us, uncap my marker. \"Where do you want me to start?\" he asks. \"At the beginning.\" It is the best I can hope for. It takes coaxing to pry the story out of him. He keeps his voice impassive, like he is telling me things about a stranger, not his own life. He tells me about his mom dying, about joining the Marines. He tells me about his friend Manny, the day he died. He briefly relates deserting, coming across the troops he saved. \"What was I supposed to do, let them drown?\" he asks, his voice almost pleading. I have no answer. \"And then you came home.\" I prompt him. \"Met up with my pops. Joined the gym. Knocked Grimes out,\" he stops suddenly and sniffs. For a moment, I think he is crying. But he wipes his face and looks back up at me. \"And now you're fighting your brother.\" I say. \"Yeah.\" No matter how I try, he refuses to say anymore on the subject.[Chapter 4] Author's Note: Thank you for reading! If you have a moment, please review this story to let me know if it's worth continuing. \"He sounds like a dick.\" It is an hour before the fight. I take a moment to eat something, silently processing the day. Nick is sitting across from me. He takes a bite of his burger, wipes his mouth on his hand. \"You'd think so, but…\" I shake my head. I am too emotionally invested in this, even as I should be applauding myself. I got the story, the exclusive. My producer is ready to throw me a party. I can relax. Instead, I am all wound up. \"Doesn't it make you wonder what happened between them?\" I ask Nick. He shrugs. \"It's none of our business.\" \"Yeah, but…\" I search for a way to express what I feel. \"Paddy Conlon's face this morning, the way Brendan's wife looked, the fact that their brothers and haven't said a word to each other all weekend,\" I tick the list off on my fingers. \"A lot of people can't stand their brothers. Sounds like a family with problems.\" Nick starts scarfing fries. \"It's sad.\" I pick at my own food. \"World's a sad place. But at least you got the story. And you won 200 bucks. It's a good weekend.\" I laugh. Nick fails to notice that my smile does not reach my eyes. \"Stop caring so much.\" My producer tells me later over the phone. I am stationed in the hallway leading out to the cage. There are ten minutes to go until fight time. You can practically feel the excitement pulsing in the air. \"You get yourself in trouble with this. Remember?\" \"I know.\" He does not have to remind me of all the times I have gotten myself in too deep with my stories. It is the reason I went into sports. Hard news used to send me home crying most days of the week. A trip to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina had been my undoing. I resigned within moments of returning to the station and a month later, I was interning for ESPN. Sports are safe. Objective. Unemotional. Or at least, they were. \"You should have seen this guy.\" I tell him. \"I did. I saw him in the footage you sent. I heard his story. It's brilliant. Great stuff.\" \"These are people,\" I impart to him. \"Not a soap opera.\" \"Honey,\" my producer's tone is condescending, \"they put their problems out there. We film it, inform the public. It's our job. And you do it well.\" When I do not respond, he continues, \"film the fight, get the last interview and get back down here.\" He hangs up. I wander back out, unable to shake my feelings of unrest. Nick waves happily at me from his place by the cage. He is excited to be filming the fight. I should be excited too. I got the scoop. The sounds of Beethoven fill the air and the crowd erupts. Brendan Conlon is walking to the cage, head high, arm in arm with his trainer. He blows a kiss to his wife, climbs in. He is focused. An entire section of Marines in uniform begins to sing, heralding the arrival of Tommy Riordan. His father is not with him. He walks alone up the aisle, pausing only to salute his brothers from the Corps. He does not spare his real brother a second glance. What happens next is brutal. I am plugged in wirelessly to Nick's camera, so I can hear every grunt, every sickening smack of flesh on flesh. I can hear the pop of Tommy's shoulder, I can hear Brendan's desperate attempts to make his brother stop fighting. I hear them cursing, sobbing and finally, the sound of Brendan telling his brother that he is sorry. That he loves him. I have no idea what he could be sorry about, but I find myself struggling not to cry all the same. I lean down to compose myself and miss Tommy tapping out. Nick swoops in for the shot of the winner, but Brendan pushes him back. His arms are around his younger brother, his attention entirely focused on him. The fight has taken a total of less than 15 minutes, and somehow, the Conlon brothers have reached some understanding. Brendan all but carries Tommy out of the ring, his trainer in tow. I see Paddy Conlon, a bittersweet look etched on his face. I see Brendan's wife rushing after them. Acting on instinct, I follow them. Not for the story, but for myself. I have to know. I sneak down the hall, encountering little resistance. The brothers are literally and figuratively wrapped around one another. Only Brendan's trainer casts me a warning glance. \"No cameras,\" I hold up my palms. \"I just wanted to make sure they're ok.\" Brendan's wife looks back at me. \"Let her in.\" The trainer looks surprised. He opens his mouth to protest but she cuts him off. \"Frank, Tommy's going to need all the sympathy he can get,\" she glances at a few Marines waiting to take Tommy into custody. \"Tess is right,\" a gruff voice imparts. \"We're going to need help.\" Paddy Conley sizes me up. Four other pairs of eyes join his. \"Well,\" Brendan looks up at me, still holding his bleeding brother. \"Can you help?\" \"Yes.\" I hear myself agreeing. \"I can help.\"[Chapter 5] Author's Note: Thank you for reading and especially to those who reviewed! If you have a moment, please review this story to let me know if it's worth continuing. Thanks! \"He only wants to talk to you.\" The words are like a savior. I am standing in what can only be described as a media circus. The front parking lot of the Marines Corp Headquarters is absolutely bursting at the seams with reporters. There are live trucks, camera crews, and photographers everywhere. And I am standing in the absolute center of it all. I did not bother to bring Nick; cameras will not be allowed in that building anyway. I arrived this morning entertaining the simple notion that I might be able to make contact with Tommy and establish a plan of action. By all rights, I should not even really be here. I am technically on vacation; I was unable to convince the producer that the story was worth pursuing beyond Sparta. So I took my annual vacation, but instead of packing my bikini and heading for a warm beach, I packed some suits and headed for Arlington, Virginia. This is a nightmare. The mantra runs through my head on repeat as I snake around bodies, trying to figure out what I am going to do. Brendan Conlon warned me from the hotel this morning that it might be difficult to gain access to Tommy. Talk about an understatement. I fiddle with my phone, punching in the unfamiliar number that will connect me to the Conlon family. Brendan, his wife Tess, their two daughters and Paddy Conlon are all shacked up in two rooms at an Embassy Suites a few miles away. The family seems to have reached some reconciliation, a truce cemented by their presence here in Virginia. Brendan and Paddy have been allowed limited access to Tommy. They reported to me that he is being treated well. But the reporters are not here just for Tommy. Brendan announced over the weekend that half of his 5 million dollars would be going to his little brother. Tommy in turn announced that his half was going to his fallen friend's family. An emotional interview with the widow, Pilar, had followed in which she confessed the struggles her family had endured since the death of her husband by friendly fire. Her tears had thrown into the limelight the treatment of veterans and their families upon returning from overseas. The nation was in an uproar. This has gone beyond a simple sports story. This is a national calamity. Even the President has issued a statement, condemning the past treatment of veterans and promising legislation and outreach programs for the future. I wait patiently as the line rings, praying someone will answer. A little girl's voice responds on the fifth ring. It takes some coaxing to get her to hand the phone to her father. \"I can't get in.\" I tell him and briefly relate what is going on. \"Give me a minute. I need to make a call.\" He hangs up. I am left alone again, contemplating my next move. My next move finds me in the form of a young Marine standing on an upside down crate. He is bellowing my name. \"Nicole Ryan!\" he yells through a megaphone. A hush falls over the crowd momentarily. I push my way through, trying to be polite and ending up just elbowing my way in. \"Miss Ryan?\" the man with the megaphone is young, almost a kid. He gives me a stern look, reaches down to shake my hand. \"What's all this about?\" I question. \"It's Tommy Conlon,\" he answers. \"He's allowed a half hour to speak with the media. He only wants to speak to you.\" I feel pride swell in the pit of my belly and I quickly quell it. It is not a competition. I am here for a greater purpose than getting an exclusive. I nod at the young man, and proceed through the front doors and the security check point. I surrender the contents of my purse to a guard and am led down a series of hallways by the same officer from outside. \"Thanks for coming out and finding me,\" I tell him, attempting conversation. \"Of course,\" the response is polite but curt. I am just settling back into silence when the young man turns to me again. \"I'm a big fan Miss Ryan. The boys and I, we love Sports Center.\" I find myself smiling. This man, for all his seriousness, is just a kid. The thought of young guys like him overseas, fighting our battles, sobers me. I vow to autograph something for him on my way out. \"Here we are, Miss Ryan.\" He stops in front of a door. He knocks once, pushes it open and sticks his head in. \"Hey Tommy! Nicole Ryan is here to see you,\" he waves me in, gives me one last grin and shuts the door after me. Tommy Riordan, or Conlon rather, is sitting in the middle of what looks to be some kind of presentation hall. The seats are all empty save for the one he occupies. It looks like a miniature movie theatre. There is an overhead projector and some cushioned folding chairs bolted to the ground. He is in the front row, in uniform, his hair cut back into the classic Jarhead style. He looks every part the Marine, except for his still black and blue face and the sling around his left arm. \"Brendan called. Said you were here. Jeremy got the message to me.\" He nods his head in the general direction of the door. I assume the young Marine is Jeremy. \"He told me you'll only talk to me.\" I walk around to the row he is in and sit two seats down. \"Better the devil you know…\" he says in his deep scratchy voice. I choose not to dwell on his words for fear of being insulted. \"How have you been?\" it has been a week since Sparta. Tommy looks at me, one eyebrow cocked. Then he glances at his arm and surroundings. \"Right,\" I admit. \"Stupid question.\" \"Brendan said you came here to help.\" Tommy adjusts his position in his seat. He looks far too large for the chair. His muscular frame barely fits in the allotted space. \"I did,\" I confirm. \"So tell me, what's the plan?\" he drops his good arm into his lap, gives me his full attention. There's something off about it, though, and my hackles go up. \"To garner public sympathy,\" I tell him. He smirks. \"How do you plan on doing that?\" he is definitely mocking me. \"Excuse me?\" I cross my arms over my chest. \"Tell me, Miss Ryan,\" he drags my name out in a condescending way, \"What do you know about the Corps?\" He doesn't wait for an answer. \"Do you think they give a damn about public opinion?\" This time he pauses, driving his point home. \"Tell me, Mr. Conlon,\" I fire right back, \"What do you know about the power of public opinion?\" I sit up straighter, size him up. \"Not much, obviously. But this isn't my first rodeo. I worked in hard news before this and I can tell you, public opinion can make or break you. Do you know how many bad things happen in a day and get swept under the rug?\" his expression makes it clear that he does. \"The only time people in charge take action is when the public knows about it and is pissed off. And to get the American public riled up about something, they have to like you. You have the talent to get their attention.\" \"Then what's the problem?\" he asks. \"You need to keep their attention. And you're not a very likeable guy.\" I tell him. He snorts, not bothering to argue my point. \"And you're going to change that?\" I shrug, \"I'm going to try.\" \"Stop playing the martyr,\" Conlon shrugs me off, fixes me with that intense stare. \"Everyone's after something. You know how many people have been after me lately? Even before Sparta, reporters were at my door, trainers, agents. They're all offering something: fame, women, money. All I had to do was sign here,\" he stabs his finger into imaginary paper in his outstretched left hand. \"promote this, talk to them on air.\" \"What's your point?\" I ask. \"My point is everyone is after something. So don't come up in here, acting like a saint, claiming you're helping me out. You don't know me, you don't know my family, and you've got no reason to care.\" I am in shock. No one has ever spoken to me so crassly, not in my whole career of routinely stepping on people's toes. My mouth is literally hanging open as I try to formulate a response that doesn't involve cursing him out. \"Well?\" he asks, a cynical smirk twisting his lips. \"I came here because I stood in a crowd watching two brothers beat the living shit out of each other. I came here because when I knocked on your hotel room door, an old, sad man answered it screaming for you.\" He has the good grace to look somewhat ashamed. I press my advantage. \"I came here for answers, because all I see when I look at your family is a giant question mark. I see people who need help.\" It takes me a moment to realize that I am virtually yelling at him. \"We don't need your pity.\" He practically growls this at me. \"There's no danger of you having that,\" I harden my voice like his. \"I'm not here to give you that. I'm here because whatever you guys have going on right now is hanging in a very delicate balance. And there's a parking lot out there full of sharks, and they've all scented your blood. They can help you, or they can crucify you. And you need someone who can point them in the right direction.\" \"And you're going to do that?\" \"If you let me.\" He falls into silence, his eyes fixed on a point on the wall. My anger crumbles just looking at him. He is a sad little boy in a man's body, a puppy who is used to being kicked. On a whim, I lean forward and brush my fingers along the sleeve of his tan shirt. He flinches at the light contact, but doesn't push me away. \"Tommy, everyone needs help some time.\" I tell him. A long silence stretches between us. I am losing hope, when finally his head nods almost imperceptibly. \"Ok. What do we do?\"[Chapter 6] Author's Note: Thank you for reading and especially to those who reviewed! If you have a moment, please review this story to let me know if it's worth continuing. Thanks! \"He agreed?\" Paddy sounds shocked. Even Brendan, stationed on a hotel chair, looks surprised. His wife is perched on the armrest and is the only one not giving me a look of abject astonishment. \"You didn't think he would?\" I ask. Their reactions are not reassuring. \"I did.\" Tess says with finality. Brendan shrugs and Paddy grunts. The Conlon family is one of few words. \"He doesn't want to do time. Or be dishonorably discharged.\" I explained. \"Still, Tommy doesn't seem like the type to become a spokesperson.\" Brendan says. \"He won't be doing that much speaking.\" That was a point Tommy and I enthusiastically agreed on. \"Just one big interview. The major networks can fight amongst themselves over who gets it.\" \"Sounds like there's money in that.\" Paddy observes. It is a fair point. \"There is.\" I agree. \"But Tommy's already made up his mind to give it to charity. Veteran outreach,\" I add, when Tess asks which charity. \"So he's agreed to be the face of the cause?\" she asks. \"For now.\" I tell her. \"God,\" Brendan exhales loudly into his hands. \"He's really changed.\" \"War will do that to a man.\" Paddy says knowledgably. \"No one should have to go through the shit boys go through overseas.\" His eyes become clouded, some years old demon settling over him. Brendan gives his father a concerned look, reaches for his arm. At the contact Paddy seems to come out of his stupor. He gives his eldest son a nod. \"You're going to coach him?\" Brendan asks a moment later. \"Well, not exactly.\" I go over what Tommy and I agreed on. He will tell an abridged version of his life story to an undetermined reporter. Any statement from him will serve to whip the public into a frenzy. He will not be accusatory, he will not make excuses. Tommy does not strike me as the sort of man who would make them anyway, and it will not buy him sympathy. He will simply tell events as they happened, lend his story to the public discussion of what is to be done. And hopefully, his tale will rally enough sympathy to make positive change, not only in his trial, but in Congress. \"Sounds like a long shot,\" Paddy says when I finish. \"I have to agree.\" Brendan says. \"I don't know if it will work.\" \"It will.\" I say confidently. \"But there's something you can do to strengthen it.\" I take a deep breath, look at Paddy. \"You tell your story.\" \"Why does he need to do that?\" Brendan is suddenly defensive, seconds away from leaping out of his chair. \"Not the whole thing,\" I hasten to say. \"Just your time in Vietnam. What it was like coming back.\" Brendan speaks. \"That's too much, Pop. You don't have to do that.\" But Paddy only looks at me. \"Will it help, Tommy?\" \"Pop—\" Brendan tries again. Paddy holds up a hand to silence him. \"Will it?\" he repeats. \"It will.\" I say. Slowly, Paddy nods. This time Brendan does stand up, anger apparent on his face. His wife reaches for his arm but he evades her. \"I need to talk to you.\" He grates out. Tess gives me a weary look, but Paddy takes her by the arm. \"Come on, Tess, let's go take the girls to the pool.\" He shuffles through the adjoining door to the next hotel room over. The sounds of Dora the Explorer can be heard as they leave the room. Tess casts a look at me over her shoulder, than a sterner look at her husband. He ignores it. \"Why are you here?\" Brendan asks me before the door is even closed. Here we go again. These questions are working my nerves. \"Tommy asked the same thing,\" I tell him. \"What'd you tell him?\" I want to laugh at the similarities in the brothers' posturing. Brendan's brow furrows in exactly the same manner as Tommy's and they even cross their arms the same way. \"To help. Like you asked me to.\" I emphasize. \"You're prying too much.\" He tells me. \"How the hell am I supposed to know that?\" it is my turn to be angry. Working with these people is like skating on thin ice. They are an emotional tilt-a-whirl. \"You guys haven't given me any back story. How am I supposed to know what's too sensitive to talk about?\" There is a moment of silence as Brendan contemplates this. \"You have a point.\" He admits. He rubs his palm along his brow, sighs. \"You might have noticed by now that my family is kind of…\" he trails off. \"Dysfunctional?\" I readily supply. \"Yeah,\" he chuckles bitterly. \"You could say that.\" \"I'm not asking for details.\" I tell him. \"Just the overview.\" Brendan continues laughing. \"All right. You asked.\" He drops back into his chair. \"Don't say you didn't ask,\" he warns me. He takes a deep breath. And then he begins to speak. His voice is deadpan, much like his brother's was, like he is reading to me from a script. He starts at the literal beginning. He tells me how his parents met. His dad had come back from several tours in Vietnam. His mom had just graduated high school. They met, got pregnant, got married, gave birth to him. Two years later, Tommy came around. He mentions never really knowing a stable environment. His father was always drunk, his mom routinely war sunglasses, even in the house, to hide her bruises. He tells me how Tommy and him used to run from it all, when their parents started yelling. He says they would flee to a park, or the attic and wait it out. He says that when they were very little, Tommy used to cry. He describes rocking his brother, just wishing it would stop. He says there were times where things were almost good. He remembers a vacation to a beach, a few happy days. He remembers his dad teaching him the basics of wrestling. How those brief, sober moments with his father mark the happiest in his childhood. How Tommy joined in one day, what a natural talent he was. How thrilled Paddy was to have such a gifted protégé. How Tommy became the center of their father's attention and how he started focusing on other things, school, football, grades, Tess. How he tried to not begrudge Tommy his success. How they began to grow apart, even before the split. He begins to tear up. I wait with baited breath, not knowing what to say, not wanting to break the silence. \"Pop, he got out of control one night. More so than usual,\" Brendan is saying. \"Ma, she tried to calm him down like always, but…\" his sobs choke him. I feel as though I cannot breathe. \"Anyway,\" he says after a moment. \"Tommy and I stayed up all night. Tommy was talking about running, about stopping Pop next time he lost control. I don't remember what I said.\" He wipes his eyes, straightens up. \"The next morning, I went to work at this little corner shop. Tommy tried to get me to stay home, but I went anyway. I was saving up for school.\" He adds, trying to justify himself. I just nod. \"I got home and they were gone. Pop had a fit. Tore the house up. We figured they'd be back, but…\" Brendan breaks off. His body seems to deflate, as though all the energy has gone out of him. \"I was 16.\" He says. \"Tommy was 14.\" \"And you didn't see him again?\" I don't recognize my own voice. It is high pitched, like a squeak. I realize to my horror that I have begun to cry. I hastily wipe my tears. \"Not until Sparta.\" Brendan turns his head to the window, \"He said I abandoned him. Left him for Tess.\" His chin trembles. \"Brendan, you were just a kid,\" I feel the urge to comfort him, but he is not having it. \"I was old enough. I chose Tess over my little brother. Over my mom. She died, you know? Tommy was the only one there to bury her. He took off to the Marines.\" He is openly crying now, not even trying to disguise the streams of salt tears flowing over his battered cheeks. \"I never got to say goodbye. Not to him. Not to mom. I keep thinking, if I had just left with them, maybe—\" \"You can't think like that. Think of your family, your daughters. They never would have been here if you'd left.\" I picture the cherubic little girls down at the swimming pool, the happiness that is written all over Brendan's face when he looks at them. I think of Paddy, the broken old man. I cannot reconcile the two versions of him in my head. He is so calm now, so sad. He only lights up when his granddaughters or his son are interacting with him. Pieces click into place in my mind. I understand Tommy's anger, Brendan's dedication to his family. \"I know,\" Brendan says. \"I know. It's just I still feel guilty.\" He wipes his face. \"I had Tess, you know? Even when I didn't have Pop, Tess was there. And Tommy….\" He shakes his head back and forth, like he is trying to swat away a bug, \"he had no one.\" I wish I had some words of comfort. Instead, I say the only thing I can. \"It's going to be ok, you know?\" He laughs, but there is no mirth in the sound. \"Is it?\" \"It's going to take work. But you guys are going to make it.\" I nod feverously. \"It might take some therapy though.\" I do not know what compels me to joke, but Brendan smiles genuinely. \"I'm rich now. So we can afford it.\" His smile widens. He begins to laugh. It is a rusty sound, like his throat is not used to the motion. \"See? Silver lining to every cloud.\" We are both laughing now. I rush for the bathroom, still in giggles. I wet a washcloth for myself, then one for Brendan. He catches it as I toss it to him. \"Thanks,\" he buries his face in the fabric. \"Nicole?\" he asks me suddenly. \"Yeah?\" I'm meticulously trying to wipe away the mascara that has run down my cheeks. \"You're an all right person, you know?\" he says. It is the closest thing I have gotten to a compliment from any of the Conlons. I smile. \"You guys are too.\" This time, Brendan looks as though he believes me.[Chapter 7] Author's Note: Thank you for reading and especially to those who reviewed! If you have a moment, please review this story to let me know if it's worth continuing. Thanks! \"Do you even know how to smile?\" My patience is at the end of its rope. Tommy glowers back at me. \"It's been known to happen.\" \"I bet you have a beautiful smile,\" I feel like a mother trying to convince a stubborn toddler to eat his peas. His glower deepens. I sigh. \"These aren't school pictures. I don't smile when I don't want to.\" He leans back further into his chair. \"So you don't smile,\" I tick off on my fingers, \"and you don't tell jokes.\" \"I'm not really in the mood for jokes. It's been a bad couple of weeks.\" He delivers this line so seriously, that I start to feel guilty. Then the corner of his mouth twitches ever so slightly. \"Oh my gosh, that was almost it!\" I am grinning like a fool now. \"You do what you say you can and you might see a few more.\" He scratches the back of his head with his good hand. The other is still confined to a sling, though he insists it's fine. \"Well, that's some serious motivation then.\" Tommy goes back to staring out of the window. On top of being surly and stubborn, he has the attention span of a gold fish. I stare patiently at him like a teacher waiting for the class to calm down. He shows no sign that he notices me. His expression is relaxed and I'm struck by how young he is. In this rare quiet moment, his face is unlined and he actually looks content. \"Tommy.\" He jerks his attention back to me. His chair rocks for a moment and he loses balances. I am treated to another view of him out of his element as he rocks wildly. I begin to laugh at the thought that if his fans saw him now, he would not look anything like the killer they are used to watching in the cage. He gives me a reproachful look as I laugh at his predicament. Rolling my eyes, I watch him wiggle a bit more. I reach out with a foot and catch the chair, leaning it even further back. \"What are you doing?\" he asks. I delight in his rare moment of uncertainty. \"Ask for help.\" I cannot resist the urge to teach a small lesson. \"What?\" he repeats. He tries to swing his weight forward but I kick the chair again, sending him back. \"Ask for help, Tommy.\" He looks as though he wants to curse me out. When his usual glare does not intimidate me into backing down, he considers his options. \"Fine,\" he clips out. \"Miss Ryan, would you do me the favor of lowering my chair?\" he puts on a fake British accent that surprises me. \"Certainly, Mr. Conlon.\" I lower him to the ground. \"You're lucky you're a woman.\" He says to me with no real venom. \"Why? You going to hit me?\" I mean it as a joke but his mood turns extremely serious. \"Never.\" His gray eyes bore into me. I feel suddenly uncomfortable. I have to remember that Tommy is not a person with a regular upbringing. His reality is full of what have only been my nightmares. I want to rectify my mistake. He has gone back to staring out of the window. An idea strikes me. \"Come on.\" I stand up, pat his knee. He looks at me like I am crazy. \"What?\" \"When's the last time you were outside?\" I ask him. He does not answer. \"Come on,\" I repeat, seizing his arm and wrenching him up. Or at least, I attempt to pull him up. He weighs what seems like a ton. Sighing, he drops his legs to the floor and pushes himself to standing. \"You're crazy, you know that?\" it is less of a question and more of a statement of fact. I roll my eyes again and lead him to the door. I poke my head out. Jeremy is stationed there. \"Miss Ryan?\" he asks politely. \"Is there a place outside we can sit?\" Jeremy looks surprised, but recovers quickly. \"Give me a second, Miss Ryan. I'll ask.\" Ten minutes later and Tommy and I are seated in the grass in a courtyard of the complex. A few Marines walk by and look curiously at us. Tommy looks embarrassed; his neck and ears have gone scarlet. I decide not to dwell on it. After all, he has never seemed comfortable with attention. \"Have you decided who you want to talk to?\" I bring his attention back to matters at hand. \"We look like we're having a damn picnic out here,\" he mumbles. \"You'd rather be back in the room?\" he is irritating me again. \"No,\" he looks like a toddler throwing a tantrum. \"It's just-\" \"You're embarrassed to be seen with me,\" I supply, resisting the urge to roll my eyes. \"We look like a couple,\" He blurts out. His face flushes this time. I have no response for this. We have only interacted a few times and I do not think anyone looking in on us would harbor any delusions of romantic feelings. Still, I feel like I need to defuse the situation. \"You could do worse,\" I tease. He raises his eyebrows in what I guess could be agreement and flops backwards into the grass. I get the sense that he does not want to look at me. \"You can pick the reporter,\" he mumbles. \"Are you going to make me do everything?\" I am half-joking, half-exasperated. \"You're the expert,\" He cranes his neck up to look at me. \"You're the one who has everything on the line,\" I need him to understand the seriousness of the situation. \"I've got nothing on the line,\" He tells me. \"I don't have family, a girl, money. Nothing. It doesn't matter what happens to me.\" This pity party has got to stop. Since violence seems to be the only thing he understands, I lean down and smack him on the top of his head. I do not use enough force to do any real damage, but he bolts up like a pop tart. \"You've got a family.\" I say, \"They're sitting in a hotel, ten minutes away, ringing their hands and stressing about what's going to happen to you,\" I look him dead in the eye. He seems to contemplate this for a moment. \"No one from Fox news.\" He says finally. \"Anyone else is fine.\" Now we are getting somewhere. \"You don't have a favorite?\" \"Anderson Cooper.\" He says at length. \"If he wants to.\" He sounds boyishly uncertain for a moment, as though he has no idea how famous he has become over the last the last few weeks. \"He seems to get it right more than the rest,\" His trademark cynicism creeps back into his tone. He flops back to a lying position, seemingly exhausted by the decision making process. \"I'm sure he'd be happy to interview you,\" I make a note to call Gavin and see if he can contact Cooper's camp. Tommy grunts. \"Do you have a daily word quota?\" I ask him. \"Does it physically hurt you to communicate?\" \"I don't have anything to say,\" he tells me. \"I think you've got plenty to say.\" \"You don't know me.\" \"I'm a journalist. It's my job to read people.\" \"Yeah?\" he challenges. \"Read me.\" It's the question I'd been praying he would ask. \"You've got a hard exterior. Obviously,\" I gesture to all of him, \"But you're not as cynical as you want people to believe. You're smarter than you put out there, you're more emotional than you put out, and you're unfailingly polite, even when you're trying to be rude,\" He looks skeptical. \"You're all, yes ma'mm, no sir, thank you,\" he begins to flush again. \"You hold doors.\" \"I pull out chairs too,\" he adds. This time he smiles genuinely. I wish I had a camera with me to capture the moment. Fearless Tommy Conlon, lying in the grass and smiling. \"What else do you do?\" I ask. Tommy smirks, but it is not the mean twist of his lips I am used to seeing. In fact, he looks cocky. It occurs to me that my question could be interpreted as flirting. I feel a blush creeping into my cheeks. Thank God I have dark skin. He might not see it. \"You want me to tell you my deepest darkest secrets. You want me to get on television and tell the world my story, invite them into my problems. But you don't tell me anything about yourself.\" He regards me with a titled head. I have to admit he has a point. \"What do you want to know?\" I am assuming a question about my middle name, my favorite color, or where I am from will come up. \"Why do you care so much, about what happens to me?\" he asks. \"We've been over this.\" \"Nah.\" He sits up and stares me down. \"I get that you see my family is a fucking train wreck. I get that you want to help. But why?\" at my look of confusion, he clarifies. \"What makes you care about other people? Most people will step over anyone to get where they're going. So why do you stop and actually look at the shit around you?\" His question stops me in my tracks. \"I guess….because everyone needs help. And not everyone gets it,\" it is the simplest way I can put it. \"Someone helped you out,\" It is a statement, not a question. \"Yeah,\" I am praying he does not ask me to expand on that. The look he gives me though makes it clear he is expecting me to continue. \"When I was a kid, my dad was diagnosed with cancer. My mom had to take care of him for a whole year. My grandma stepped up, raised me and my three brothers.\" \"They're older than you?\" he bypasses the meat of the story to ask about my siblings. \"Yes.\" \"They're athletic guys?\" \"Yes.\" \"That explains a lot,\" His statement seems to cover more than just my love of sports. \"So why do you joke every time something gets uncomfortable?\" This question honestly perplexes me. \"No I don't.\" \"We've known each other, what, two weeks?\" he asks. I nod. \"Every time something gets even a little tense, you make a joke.\" When I still look skeptical, he provides an example. \"I like cats?\" he quotes, incredulous. Suddenly, and despite the situation, we are both laughing in the grass. He has a nice laugh, not the mocking kind, but the kind where someone is so genuinely happy, you cannot help but to be happy too. \"That's how my brothers and I deal with things. We just make jokes. Just like your family stops talking.\" He nods, understanding. He allows me to steer our conversation back on course as we plan to meet for his interview two days from now. His trial is scheduled for next week. \"You know, they're talking about charging me with desertion.\" He says suddenly. Even with my limited knowledge, I know that this is a bad thing. \"The penalties are a lot worse for that.\" He continues. \"How much worse?\" as it stands, I'm thinking the worst that could happen is some limited prison time, a fine and a dishonorable discharge. \"They can send me back.\" His eyes are fixed on the sky now, his thoughts far away. \"I don't want to go back,\" This admission is so quiet I can barely hear it. \"I don't want you to go back either,\" I tell him. He nods at me. As I prepare to leave a half hour later, the two of us shuffle down the hall together. The guards are back. One of them hands me my belongings as two others prepare to escort Tommy down the hall to where he is being held. \"Your dad,\" he says suddenly as we part. \"Is he ok?\" I am shocked, even touched, that he asks. \"Yeah.\" I tell him. \"He's ok now.\" Tommy grins at me. If the guards are confused by our exchange, they do not show it. We part ways with me feeling better than I have for days. I think that Tommy Conlon and I have finally reached an understanding.[Chapter 8] Author's Note: Thank you for reading and especially to those who reviewed! If I haven't thanked you personally, please know that I appreciate all of your feedback! Thanks so much! \"Anderson Cooper?\" Tess is practically bouncing up and down. \"He confirmed. Tommy's going to be interviewed live tonight.\" I say. We are seated in the back of a little ma and pop Italian restaurant. Tess and Brendan are on one side of the table, Paddy and I are on the other. The two girls are sandwiched, one on each side, between the adults, coloring happily and ignoring us. \"Is he coming here?\" Tess questions again. She is smiling brightly. Her husband regards her curiously. \"No. It's going to be via satellite. But he's invited Paddy and Brendan to appear on his talk show later this week.\" The men react with indifference, but Tess nearly upends the table. \"You guys are going to meet the Silver Fox!\" she is practically squealing. Brendan shakes her head. He turns to his oldest daughter. \"Honey, remind me not to let mommy watch the news anymore.\" He taps the top of her brunette head. \"Ok, daddy,\" She does not even bother to look up at him, but focuses on coloring in her drawing of a red flower. \"Can we see him before the interview?\" Paddy asks. Before I can answer, his youngest granddaughter nudges him. \"Can you draw a house?\" she asks, shoving her brown crayon into his hand. Paddy looks bemused for a moment. Brendan smiles. \"Better draw a house, Pop. The little lady doesn't like to be kept waiting.\" The table is held captive for a moment as Paddy shakily traces the outlines of a square with a triangle on top onto the paper tablecloth. His granddaughter swoops in, adding a green line for grass. I realize that I am intruding on an intimate family moment of sorts. I feel out of place. The moment is broken by the waitress asking for our order. It takes Paddy a moment to recover. He stutters as he moves to his menu. Brendan kindly suggests the lasagna and Paddy agrees, relief clear on his face. What is this family that is so shaken up by the simplest moments of closeness? Brandon's words about Paddy in the past echo in my mind. I choose not to focus on them and replace the image with one of Paddy coloring with his granddaughter. Ten minutes of strained talking later and our food is brought out. The smell of marinara, alfredo and garlic set my mouth to watering. Conversation lulls as we eat, and for once, I am glad that the Conlons are not a talkative bunch. A few minutes in though, Tess goes back to berating me on what questions Cooper will ask and whether or not they are all traveling to New York for his talk show. \"Babe,\" Brendan reminds her gently, \"It's not a vacation. This is for Tommy.\" Tess looks shell-shocked. \"Sorry,\" the mood changes as she studies her food. I feel a moment of companionship with her. Though she has been part of this whole saga for more than a decade, we are both outsiders trying to deal with the shambles that are the Conlon family life. Brendan rubs her arm soothingly and pulls her to him. I look away, allowing them a private moment. My phone conveniently chooses this moment to ring. I answer it without looking at the screen, happy for an excuse to step outside. \"Where are you?\" it takes a moment to place the voice, but then it hits me. \"With your family having lunch.\" I lean against the brick wall of the restaurant, attempting to stand in the shade. The heat is sweltering and the humidity is unforgiving. My hair is beginning to rebel out of its straight style and revert back to its natural curls. \"How's that going?\" his tone makes it clear that he does not suspect it is going well. \"Fine.\" I say honestly. \"You're sister-in-law is really excited about your upcoming interview.\" Tommy grunts. \"Good for her.\" \"She's just trying to help,\" I feel a need to defend Tess. \"Yeah. Sorry,\" he sounds genuine. \"Old habits, you know?\" I do not know. I am not sure I want to. \"They want to all see you before you interview.\" The silence runs so long that I begin to suspect that my phone has dropped the call. Just as I pull it away from my ear to check, Tommy speaks. \"All at once?\" he sounds worried. It occurs to me that the Conlons have probably never been in a room together in a very long time. \"I'm guessing so,\" I say. \"And you're coming?\" he asks. \"If you want me there. I think you're well enough prepared,\" There is no point in over- prepping him; Tommy is going to say whatever he feels like, my opinions be damned. \"Yeah. I mean, it would be nice if you came.\" It is hard to tell over the phone, but he sounds nervous. He blurts the whole sentence in one breath, like it is one very long word. I weigh my options for a moment. I was looking forward to an actual night off tonight, an opportunity to relax in my room without people in it berating me. I also have a bikini in my bag screaming for a chance to get out. It occurs to me though, that I will still spend every second before 7:15 worrying about the interview and every moment after it ends dissecting it. \"I'll be there,\" I say. True to my word, I am stationed in the hallway outside of a conference room at a quarter until 7. Tommy has been in the room with his family for the past 45 minutes. I declined to come in, allowing them whatever small measure of privacy I can give them. My heels are already pinching my toes and my suit is too tight to be really comfortable. I tug the pencil skirt down and shift my weight. I have to focus on something to alleviate my nervousness. My distraction comes around the corner in the form of Jeremy. \"Hi Miss Ryan,\" he greets me like a student would greet their kindergarten teacher. I have a feeling he has developed a little crush. I also have a feeling that Jeremy's influence has made things easier as far as me having access to Tommy. \"It's a madhouse in there,\" he tells me conversationally, \"I don't see how you do that every day.\" \"It's easier than boot camp,\" I say. He laughs. \"For you maybe. Tommy looks like a fish out of water.\" He shakes his head. \"The guy who tried to clip the microphone to his shirt nearly pissed himself when Tommy swatted him away.\" My mind readily supplies a mental image to accompany that story. I join Jeremy in shaking my head. \"His family is still in there?\" I ask. \"Yes.\" Jeremy looks uncomfortable. \"It's a little…tense.\" I would imagine so. I try to smooth the situation over though. \"Well, they have a lot of hopes riding on this.\" He nods knowledgeably. \"This could change a lot, you know?\" Jeremy says. I prompt him for clarification. \"Depending on how this goes, it can change what being over there is like.\" Jeremy gets that same thousand yard stare that both Paddy and Tommy get when talking about war. \"How many tours have you been on?\" I ask him. \"Two.\" \"And you're how old?\" \"22,\" He answers. This hangs there in the air between us. Tommy has more than just his family's hopes pinned on him. Our conversation ends as the door between us opens. \"Nicole,\" Tess leads her daughters out of the room by the hand. \"I think Tommy wants to see you.\" \"Brendan and Paddy are still with him?\" I ask. She shakes her head. \"They're watching from the control room. I'm going to take the girls back to the hotel. Hopefully I'll make it in time to see it.\" I check my watch. It's 6:55. I have five, maybe ten, minutes before a producer is going to shove everyone out of the room. \"I'll see you when I get back,\" I tell her. She just smiles. \"You better go,\" Jeremy says as the three ladies head home. I want to say something more to him, but the moment is lost. I offer a weak smile and head through the door. Studio lights are plugged into every outlet, bathing the room in a harsh white light. Some intern is still fiddling with reflectors, trying to get the perfect shadowing on Tommy's face. He is seated in a simple wooden chair, looking completely uninvolved with what goes on around him. He is wearing an olive shirt that looks like if he so much as breathes too deeply it might simply just explode off of him. A young woman is dancing nervously around him, brandishing a wireless microphone. \"Mr. Conlon, I just need to clip this onto the front of your shirt,\" she is trying to keep her voice steady as she attempts to maneuver around his injured shoulder. I notice that he is not wearing his sling. Tommy spots me. He is not making any attempt to make this poor girl's job any easier. She looks to be on the verge of tears. \"I'll do it.\" I tell her. She looks relieved. I coax the device out of her hand and turn to Tommy with my no-nonsense stare. He does not resist as I clip the mic to the collar of his shirt. I have performed this lackluster task countless time, but I am struck by the awkwardness of it now. His skin feels impossibly hot as I wind the cord down the front of his shirt. I am aware that Tommy is staring hard at me. I try to be gentle near his shoulder, but I am forced to pull the cord, disrupting his arm. He does not so much as wince, but continues following my actions with his eyes. After what seems like an eternity, I get the microphone to the bottom of his shirt. I release the breath I did not realize I was holding. I feel flushed, an irrational reaction. I glance around, fearful that someone has noticed. Everyone is still busy with their own tasks. \"You have to stick it in your back pocket,\" I tell him. My voice cracks a bit. \"You don't want to do that for me too?\" I can't tell if he's joking or not. \"I think you can handle it,\" I fidget with my clothing as he follows my instructions. I am somehow too nervous to look him in the eye. \"3 minutes till start!\" the cameraman yells to no one in particular. The madness around us continues. \"Are you ready?\" the question is almost pointless now; he is going on in 15 minutes whether he wants to or not. \"As I'm ever going to be.\" He wipes his face. I have realized that this motion is his only outward sign of nervousness. \"You'll be great,\" The words come out rushed. I try again. \"They already like you.\" \"You said I'm not that likeable,\" He tries to sound light, as if it does not bother him. I feel bad for ever telling him that. \"I've changed my position,\" I tell him confidently. \"You just take a while to get to know.\" \"So you think they're going to know me in a five minute interview?\" he is talking quietly, making his voice sound like a rumble. I have to kneel down in front of him just to hear what he is saying. \"Be yourself,\" I tell him. \"Don't stress over it. Answer the questions honestly. It'll be over before you know it.\" He jerks his head in a nod. \"All right.\" \"And hey,\" I lightly touch his wrist to bring his attention back to me. \"If all else fails, do that strong, silent, broody thing. You're good at that.\" He graces me with another genuine smile. He flips his arm over and brushes his fingers along the palm of my hand. \"All right people, clear the set!\" the cameraman is yelling again. He is clearly addressing me. \"Give her a second, all right?\" Tommy responds. The authority with which he says this daunts the man into a temporary silence. \"You're going to be fine,\" I say. I begin to push myself back to standing. \"I'll be watching with your brother and dad.\" He nods again and takes a deep breath, sucking his teeth. As I begin to move my hand, he catches it in his broad grip. For a moment, he traces the skin on my hand with his thumb, running the callused surface over palm. The motion is not consistent with what I know of him at all; it is gentle, almost tentative. I am struck by the thought that I am holding the hand that beat some of the world's toughest men into unconsciousness, a hand that has likely killed. All at once he lets go. The moment is over as suddenly as it begins. I retreat to the control room, ignoring the glare of Mr. Uptight-Cameraman, and seat myself next to Paddy. The two men barely glance my way. Their eyes are fixed firmly on the opening of Anderson Cooper: 360 . In his perfect diction, I hear Anderson Cooper announce the guests on the show. At the name \"Tommy Conlon\", everyone in the room seems to hold their breath. \"Please,\" I pray silently, \"please God, let this go well.\" I realize that I have involuntarily raised the hand Tommy was holding to my cheek. I press it against my face, drawing some comfort in the motion. I focus on the lingering sensations his fingers caused, willing myself to calm down. \"Here we go,\" Paddy rumbles out from my right side. I do not respond. I am too busy focusing on why my heart is beating so quickly.[Chapter 9] Author's Note: Thank you for reading and especially to those who reviewed! If I haven't thanked you personally, please know that I appreciate all of your feedback! Thanks so much! I feel dizzy with relief. I am practically slumped over in my chair, devoid of all ladylike manners. It is as if I was carrying a yolk around my neck for the past week and someone has finally lifted it off. I need a massage, a vacation, or at very least a drink. I am seconds away from suggesting it when I remember that there is a recovering alcoholic in the room. Looks like I will be drinking alone tonight. Still, after so much stress, the idea has appeal. Brendan is seated to my left, his head practically in his lap, a cell phone pressed to his ear. \"Did you see it, baby?\" he is asking into the receiver. His face is split virtually down the middle with a huge grin. \"I know,\" he is saying. \"He did great.\" Paddy is ringing his newsboy cap in his hands. It is probably bent completely out of shape by now. He does not seem like he cares at all. He is shuffling around, burning off nervous energy. \"Tommy did it,\" he says to no one in particular. I feel a sudden stab of affection for him. \"Your boy did good,\" I pat his back. \"It'll be our turn next pop.\" Brendan hangs up his phone. He still looks elated. \"You'll coach us too?\" Paddy asks, a tone of desperation in his voice. \"Of course,\" if my smile does not quite reach my eyes, no one notices. Paddy and Brendan are happily chatting away. I feel exhausted. The idea of flopping into bed or taking a long hot bath are so appealing right now, I would happily pay for the privilege. The two men hurry out of the door, shouting their thanks back to me. I know they are going to talk to Tommy. I do not bother following. Instead, I kick my shoes off in the blessedly empty room, throw my feet up on the chair next to me and rest my eyes. Despite my attempt to relax, I begin pulling apart Tommy's interview in my mind. The first 15 minutes of the show were hell; my stomach was clenched in knots, my muscles balled tight. Every commercial break felt like an eternity, but finally, Tommy's interview arrived. As he was introduced, the show cut to a split screen with the satellite image of Tommy on the left and the impeccable Anderson Cooper on the right. Tommy looked as unaffected as ever, though I was pleased to see he had straightened up in his chair. Anderson started off with the basics, a short explanation as to who Tommy was, and a brief video montage of his fights during Sparta. Then the questions began. His camp had emailed a list of nearly 50 potential questions that might be asked. But ultimately, it was the reporter's choice. Cooper did not disappoint. \"Mr. Conlon,\" he had begun. Tommy interrupted. \"Tommy is fine, sir,\" he said. \"Tommy then,\" Cooper looked amused but quickly sobered. \"Tell us what led to your decision to desert?\" There was a silence where I feared that Tommy would not answer. Then he began. \"When you're over there, the Corp, they become your brothers.\" He shifted slightly in his chair, \"You live with those people, you eat with those people, you even kill with them. They're you're family. And in my case, you know, that was almost literally true. I'd spent years with them. And to see them get wiped out, I was prepared for that. We were ready for the possibility that an enemy might pop out, kill us at anytime. That a bomb might go off, a suicide bomber might take us out.\" He trailed off for a moment, \"But we weren't ready for that. We weren't trained for that, you know?\" \"You are talking about the incident with the friendly fire?\" Anderson prompted him to continue. \"Yeah. It was a pretty normal day. We thought we were in the clear. We were ready to head back to base, and it started. Bombs raining down everywhere, bullets. We could see the planes, we knew they were American. We were waving our flags. Guys that I knew for years were falling around me, blood everywhere.\" He broke off again, licked his lips. \"And Manny and I, we were running, screaming, and then it happened. Bullets went right through him. He fell, hit me and we both went down. We were the last two. The planes left, but it wasn't over. Manny was bleeding, coughing, asking for his wife.\" Tommy's eyes were shiny. He focused on a place on the ground. Anderson gave him a second to get himself together. \"What do you tell your friend,\" Tommy asked, \"when he's screaming for his family and you're in the middle of some desert, trying to stop him from bleeding with just your hands? How do you sleep at night when everyone's dead, and just you survived? When you have to walk out of the desert and leave the bodies of your friends out in the sun for the birds? And what do you tell yourself when the people who did that are supposed to be your brothers?\" Anderson did not have an answer. \"We are being told that the Marines are launching an investigation into how it happened.\" \"Doesn't bring anyone back,\" Tommy shrugged. \"I'm not making excuses for what I did. I deserted. It was wrong and I know that. I take responsibility. But they need to, too.\" Tommy looked into the camera. \"Those families? They're owed an explanation. A real one, not some impersonal apology note and some battered dog tags.\" Just thinking about his words gives me chills. When the interview ended, the whole room was silent. The moment the camera was off though, the crew in the room with Tommy gave him a round of applause that we could hear through the wall. My phone is still exploding with text messages, some no doubt from Gavin and maybe a few from my producer. I will answer them later. I just need a moment. There had only been enough time for one question. Tommy had answered it with the brutal honestly I expected, but also a vulnerability I thought he would try his hardest to hide. It is a side I have only been privileged enough to get glimpses of, and he just put it on display for the whole country. I will need to get the tape of that interview. I make a mental note to email Cooper's people for it. But it can wait until morning. I resign myself to a few minutes more work. I put my uncomfortable shoes back on and totter back next door. The crew is packing up lights and cables and dragging them back outside to their truck. I slide in past them. One lone man remains, Mr. Uppity-Cameraman, his camera rolling and pointed at something in the middle of the room. I slowly approach and peak behind him. What I see nearly floors me. Paddy and his sons are locked into what could only be described as the manliest group hug I have ever seen. I do not know what brought it on, but I feel incredibly humbled to just be witnessing it. Tommy is in the middle, sandwiched between his big brother and his father. I cannot be sure, but I think they might be crying. Even the cameraman seems to realize that this is a private family moment. He switches off his camera and slowly begins to back out of the room. He throws me a final look over his shoulder as he leaves, giving me a respectful nod. The door shuts behind him and I am left alone with the Conlon men. I contemplate following the CNN crew out, but Paddy calls me name. \"Nicole,\" he gestures wildly towards me, beckoning me towards them. I shake my head, but then Brendan joins in. I approach slowly, the way someone might approach a wild animal. All at once I am being sucked in, like their hug is a black hole. It is dark and I cannot tell one person from the other. I reach around tentatively, grasping an arm and someone else's back. The smells of Old Spice deodorant and the scent of cologne I cannot quite place overwhelm my senses. I am trapped between three men that I did not even know knew how to hug or even express emotion. \"I have to get back,\" Brendan pulls away first. \"Tess and the girls are waiting for me.\" He looks seconds away from crying. \"But we'll see you tomorrow, before we leave, all right Tommy?\" He looks at his little brother, their arms still around one another. \"See you tomorrow.\" Tommy pulls him in for one last hug. The two stare at one another for a long moment. \"Pop?\" Brendan says finally. Paddy nods, embraces his youngest son and then heads out of the door with his eldest. \"See you back at the hotel, Nicole.\" Brendan calls as they leave. The door swings shut and it is just Tommy and I. \"You did really well, Tommy,\" I tell him. We are standing alone in the room, facing each other. \"Yeah, that's what Brendan and Pop said.\" He looks uncomfortable with the praise, but happy. \"I'm proud of you,\" I say honestly. He smiles, looking so boyish that I feel my heart swell. His eyes are a little puffy around the edges. I can see faint tear stains cutting down his cheeks. That he can find a reason to smile at all, especially with his trial impending, moves me. Without thinking I lean forward and wrap my arms around him. I can feel the muscles in his back flex under my palms as he moves his right arm. His left arm, still sore, hangs loosely at our sides, but the right encircles me tightly. His hand grasps my waist. I press my face into the warm cotton of his shirt, feeling the soft texture against my cheek. His chin comes to rest on my shoulder and he leans down, burying his face in my hair. I vaguely reflect that washing it this morning was an excellent idea. We stay locked like this for a few moments, just basking in the silence. I can hear his heartbeat; it pounds a strong, steady rhythm beneath my cheek. After all he has been through, he is alive, and for the first time since we met, he looks like he realizes it. \"Thank you,\" his voice is so soft it startles me. His mouth is pressed near my ear. I can feel the slight pressure of his lips on the sensitive skin there. \"Of course.\" I nod against his chest. \"And for helping Pop too. And Brendan.\" I continue to nod. I am feeling overemotional. If I do not get control soon, I will be sobbing into his shirt. Pulling myself together, I finally disengage from his embrace. He allows me to step back, but keeps a light grip on my waist. \"Your trial is Monday.\" I know that he is aware of this, but I need to say something. \"Pop and Brendan are going to be in New York for that show.\" He says. It is clear that he is anxious about this. \"I'll be here.\" I tell him. \"They're not going to let me see you, after tonight.\" He swallows hard. \"They're only allowing immediate family tomorrow, and then no one.\" He has a weekend of hellish anticipation ahead of him. \"But after the trial,\" I am trying to sound confident, but a sense of panic is snaking its way into me, \"I'll see you.\" \"If you're still here.\" When I look a bit affronted, he clarifies. \"I mean, depending on how the trial goes, I might be free to walk or…\" \"I'll see you Monday,\" I say. My hand slides down to his at my waist. I give it a firm squeeze. \"Right after your trial ends.\" \"All right,\" he is trying to hide his smile. \"Ah ha!\" I triumphantly gesture with my free hand, \"That's two smiles in one day.\" He tries to coax his face back to indifference but fails miserably. \"It's a special occasion,\" he says seriously but the grin remains. \"I told you your smile would be beautiful,\" I mean to sound teasing but I actually mean it. It is not very conventional; his teeth are not perfectly straight, lending his grin a lopsided tilt. But it is uniquely his. I will have to keep in contact with him and find ways to bait him for his smile more often. Tommy blushes again. His modesty never fails to surprise me. He looks down at the floor, shifting his grip around my waist. My skin seems to tingle at his touch. I suddenly become aware that if someone were to walk in on us now, our behavior would certainly not look professional. Perhaps Tommy comes to this realization as well because he is looking at me hard, his ears still tinged pink. He unexpectedly leans forward while simultaneously jerking my hips toward him. His lips come crashing down on mine. I freeze up, mentally weighing the pros and cons of kissing him back. Certainly the action would be unprofessional, but we have been slowly crossing that line anyway over the past few days. Besides, I am not even working, so it is not a conflict of interest. The most important point, however, is that I want to kiss him. So for once, I stop thinking and just go with it. The kiss is relatively tame, a chaste, closed mouth affair. But just the feeling of his lips, so warm and firm, makes me want more. I am tempted to pull him closer to me but the sound of loud footsteps coming down the hall stops me. We jump apart with only a second to spare. Jeremy has come bursting through the door with a few other Marines in tow. If they notice anything unusual they do not comment. In fact, I might as well be invisible; they crowd around Tommy. I take the opportunity to step back and compose myself. It was just a kiss after all, but my breathing is labored and I feel as though I have run a mile. Tommy looks more put together than I am, but I suppose he is more adapt at disguising his emotions. \"Do you need someone to escort you out, Miss Ryan?\" a blonde Marine is asking politely. I know an invitation to leave when I hear one. \"I'll be fine, thank you.\" I have to marvel at my own ability to keep my voice even. \"I'll see you Monday,\" Tommy tells me. He sounds so casual. \"Monday,\" I confirm. I am still shaking as I walk outside to my car.[Chapter 10] Author's Note: Thank you for reading and especially to those who reviewed! If I haven't thanked you personally, please know that I appreciate all of your feedback! Thanks so much! I am talking a mile a minute as the elevator descends to the lobby. \"Just stay calm and be honest. Lying is the worst thing you can do. You can fact check anything these days. Tell things the way they happened. You can omit details, but don't fabricate them.\" Brendan and Paddy are nodding at me. Tess also hangs on my every word. \"Let your personality show. Don't be afraid to laugh if something's funny. If something makes you emotional, pause, let it sink in. Don't let him bully you into giving more details than you want to give.\" I continue. \"Got it.\" Brendan's tone is all business. I am willing to bet this is what he sounds like when he teaches. He bends down and fusses with his daughters' suitcase. The two little girls look anxious beyond belief. They are positively buzzing with energy. Tess told them last night that they were going to New York. They are too young to see it as anything but a vacation. I convinced Brendan to stay and sightsee after the show. They won't have access to Tommy anyway, and it might alleviate some of the anxiety. \"You'll be watching?\" Paddy asks. \"Not until it airs on Monday,\" I remind him kindly. \"But please call me and let me know how it goes.\" He just nods. They are not even out of Virginia yet and Paddy looks nervous. The elevator dings and we pile out. We're walking quickly through the lobby. They have a flight to catch in 45 minutes. Brendan scoops up his eldest daughter and her suitcase. Tess holds the youngest and Paddy has the rest of the bags. I accompany them to the front drive. A cab is already waiting. \"Let us know, please, if Tommy contacts you.\" Tess says out of the window of the taxi van. I agree. \"If you can get a message to him, tell him that—\" Brendan starts. The cab is already pulling away from the curb. He breaks off his sentence, but I have an idea of what he might want me to say. \"I will.\" I promise. \"Don't be nervous. Anderson's a nice guy. And enjoy yourself.\" The girls cheer happily from the van, but Brendan still looks worried. The Conlon family waves at me when their cab speeds away from the curb. I am left standing on the corner, waving back. Finally, a moment alone. I contemplate what I should do with my time and come up with nothing. I suppose I could phone my parents, check in on my brothers. I have probably got a stack of emails flooding my inbox and some texts and calls need returning. I contemplate this for a minute before I turn around, take the elevator to my room and throw on my bathing suit. If I have to work, damn it, I am going to work from the side of the pool. The pool is relatively empty. I have full run of the place and the best pick of lounge chairs. I select one half in the shade and half out, lay my towel across it, adjust my sunglasses and flop out. By the time I get around to making those calls I am halfway done with my pina colada and my skin is a shade darker than it was an hour ago. I call Gavin first. He is irritated that it took so long, but compliments me on how Tommy did. He informs me that our producer is clamoring for a follow up interview with Tommy. I refrain from telling him that it might be a conflict of interest for me now. By modern standards, what Tommy and I shared was barely a kiss. And there certainly were no promises exchanged, or any words at all, really. Both of us could go on with our lives and call the kiss nothing more than a gesture of thanks. I would be sorely disappointed if we did. I spent the majority of my time in bed last night trying to pinpoint the exact moment when my attraction for Tommy began. It is proving to be a challenge. I retrace our relationship, all the way back to the beginning. Even in that casino something about him gave me pause. At the time, I was sidetracked by his status, by my desire to do my job. But even when I got the interview, I agreed to help him, even jumped at the chance. I used my vacation time and spent it in the sweltering humidity, stressing over the issues of people I barely know. For what? Did I get a glimpse of his abs in the cage and subconsciously decide to chase after them? Am I really so enraptured by his smile? So taken in by his brooding? I am not some teenage girl fawning over the bad boy. So why is it that I am sitting here, thinking about Tommy Conlon? And is he thinking about me? I want to slap myself. I need to get it together. It was a kiss, not a profession of love. It is probably lust more than anything else, or maybe desperation. We got swept up in the emotion of it all and he kissed me. That is all. I should focus on the trial, or the pile of work I will have to do when I get back. Or maybe I should call my mother, or my brothers. I should see how my nephew is doing. I should order those new curtains I need for the house. I should actually pay attention to what Gavin is saying to me on the phone. Instead I make some excuse to hang up and promise to call him back soon. Then I order another pina colada, roll over onto my stomach and close my eyes. I return to my room an hour later, buzzed, tan and still damp from my swim. I take a long hot bath and then lounge around in nothing but a towel. I do nothing. Nothing but think. Monday seems ions away. I amuse myself for the rest of the day with actually doing some work. I write some blog posts on ESPN's website. I return messages and I finally get around to calling my parents. Sunday is more of the same. I manage to find a church nearby and attend mass. It is a nice change of pace. The priest is discussing charity, something that has obviously been close to my heart lately. I listen attentively, drawing solace. I my way out I pause to light a candle. I say a brief prayer for Tommy and another for his family. I walk out of the church and leave my fears and insecurities there. What will be, will be. Stressing about it will not change anything. I take the rest of the afternoon to sight see. Arlington Cemetery is beautiful in a haunting way. I snap a few pictures of the eternal flame at the Kennedy graves, but quickly become unsettled by the rows and rows of pristine ivory crosses spanning over the green hills. With all the war talk lately, those crosses represent more to me than just names. I see the faces of all the young men and women I have come into contact with. I hope that they will not end up here anytime soon. I retreat from the place and hightail it across the bridge to DC. I have already seen most of the memorials, but I spend a pleasant few hours wandering through some of the more obscure Smithsonian museums. By the time I drag myself back to the hotel the sun has gone down and my feet are screaming for a break. Despite my exhaustion, I am too wound up to sleep. I take advantage of the free HBO to catch up on Game of Thrones and then lay awake with the television on low, thinking about tomorrow. The trial is blessedly in the morning, but the anticipation is still awful. I can count on CNN and the other major news channels for limited coverage, but I wish I could be there. It would be awful to stand alone in court, with no support system present. Thankfully, Tommy is a tough guy. He is also used to being alone. The thought makes me sad. I spend a restless night, punctuated by wild dreams. At first there are a few bizarre ones that I forget the moment I wake up. Then the nightmares begin. I dream the worst. I see Tommy losing his trial, being dragged off in chains. My mind conjures images I have only seen in history classes and newsreels—firing squads, hangings, trench warfare. I wake up in cold sweat. The bedside clock informs me that it is just after 6 in the morning. I give up on sleeping. I force myself to eat breakfast and flip on the news. The next few hours are a blur of speculation. I watch every major network, listen to their points. Some seem inclined to think that Tommy will get off free, that public outrage is so great that the Marines will have no choice. A minority believes that Tommy will go to prison. One radical says that he will be going back overseas. I sit cross legged on the bed, hoping for the best. One hour drags by, then two, then three. I doze off once or twice, always waking in a panic. My phone remains silent. Just as an advertisement for Anderson Cooper's show runs, I get a call from Tess. \"How did the show go?\" I refrain from asking about Tommy immediately. \"It went well, really well.\" Tess sounds exhausted. Her tone does not match her statement. \"What's wrong?\" I ask. \"Tommy called about a half hour ago,\" she sounds on the verge of tears. \"What did he say?\" A sickening feeling of dread is settling over me. \"He's going back.\" She says. I can hear her sobbing. Unbelieving, I ask her to repeat herself. \"Tommy's going back.\" She says. \"They're making him finish his tour.\" I begin to tremble violently. All of our work, all of my time, has counted for nothing. Tommy's worst fear has come true. He is going back. I begin to sob, not realizing that I am still on the phone. Tess tries to tell me something about Brendan and Paddy. They are driving the rental car back today. They will be back in a few hours. I hear her girls in the background, asking about what is wrong. Tess promises to call back. It was all for nothing. I collapse into the mattress, tears streaming down my cheeks. I feel sick to my stomach. I bury my head in the pillow, trying to get a grip on reality. I slow down my breathing, will myself to pull it together. Someone is knocking on the door, housekeeping most likely. I lean up enough to ask them to come back later. \"Nicole,\" a man's voice answers. \"Let me in.\" It is Tommy. Even without seeing him, I know. Panicking, I wipe my face and hastily go to the door. I know I look a mess. I am still wearing pajamas, my hair is in unruly curls and now my eyes are swollen. Still though, I open the door. Tommy looks put together in contrast. He is dressed in uniform. The tan fabric is pressed into crisp lines. Even his expression is composed. \"Can I come in?\" he is polite as ever, but there is urgency in his tone. \"I need to talk to you.\" Nodding, I step back and let him in.[Chapter 11] Author's Note: Thank you for reading and especially to those who reviewed! If I haven't thanked you personally, please know that I appreciate all of your feedback! Thanks so much! Did you just wake up?\" Tommy takes in my sweatpants and generally disheveled appearance. I feel very self conscious. I excuse myself to the bathroom where I take a good look at my reflection. Yikes. I look like I have a cold. I turn on the sink, heat the water up and set about correcting my exterior. I brush my teeth again, wash my face, and run some product through my hair. Five minutes later I am still in sweatpants but no longer look like the walking dead. Tommy is seated on the queen-sized bed with a dark grey duffle bag at his side. He regards me coolly as I emerge from the bathroom. He looks composed. I was having what could be described as an emotional breakdown not ten minutes ago and he is sitting there, looking as though nothing is wrong. \"You wanted to talk?\" I ask. I am still standing near the bathroom, my arms crossed over my chest. Tommy shrugs. \"Did Brendan call you?\" he asks. \"Tess.\" \"So you know?\" I nod. \"Is that what you wanted to talk about?\" \"No, not really.\" Tommy stretches his arms over his head. \"I was hoping you'd have a joke for me.\" I am confused for a moment. Then I remember our conversation from a week back. I joke when things become uncomfortable. Desperate to provide some sort of distraction, I scour my mind. I cannot even come up with a riddle. \"I'm sorry.\" I tell him, \"I can't produce them on demand.\" Tommy looks nonplussed. \"You'll have to find some different way to distract me.\" He smirks at me. I cannot understand his behavior. \"Tommy,\" I begin. I cross the room toward him. \"You've got to be feeling something. Don't you want to talk about it?\" His smile drops. \"Of course I'm feeling something.\" He tells me. \"I'm going back. It's a nightmare. I feel scared, sick, and angry. Sad,\" he admits. \"But I don't want to talk about it.\" I open my mouth to protest. \"Tommy—\" \"Don't.\" his command is firm but not cruel. \"Brandon is going to want to talk. And Pop. Probably even Tess. They're going to cry. They're going to worry.\" All at once, the emotion of the day is settling onto his face. \"I have a month,\" he continues. \"And then it's a half tour over there.\" He gestures with his hands. \"And I don't want to spend any more time than I have to thinking about it.\" \"All right,\" I push the fact that I need to talk about it to the back burner. After all, my worst nightmare has not just come true. \"What do you want to do?\" As always, I am determined to help. Tommy considers my question for a moment. \"I want to take you out.\" He says at last. \"What?\" I make no effort to disguise my surprise. \"I want to take you out somewhere.\" He repeats. \"If we met like normal people, I would have hit on you.\" He tells me. \"Maybe bought you a drink. Maybe asked you to come home with me.\" His smirk returns as I begin to blush. \"I might have said yes.\" I am on an emotional rollercoaster. My despair has been replaced by elation. \"Say yes now.\" He prompts. \"All right.\" I nod. \"Let me change first.\" I dive for my suitcase and rush for the bathroom. It takes me only a moment to select the nicest outfit that I brought with me: a white sundress with orange flowers. I quickly throw it on before I can think too deeply about it, swipe on some mascara and lip gloss and hurry out of the bathroom. It seems I change faster than Tommy. He is shirtless and in the process of jerking his jeans up around his waist. I take a moment to admire the masculine curves of his back. The hard lines of his physique contort as he shimmies into the denim. I feel my face begin to heat up along with other, more intimate body parts. I cough, suddenly nervous. \"Hey,\" again, he shows no emotion. \"I didn't want to go in my uniform.\" He gestures to a pile of neatly folded clothing on the bed. He reaches down for an unassuming t-shirt, a navy blue number that isn't as tight as his shirt from the other night, but still is hugging his body like a Koala bear pencil topper. \"Ready?\" he shoves a plain, black, baseball cap over his head and reaches out for me. I grasp his hand and follow him out of the door. It is still early enough in the day where people are either at work, or still asleep. We encounter no one in the lobby and hailing a cab is easy. With my hair curly and pulled back, and Tommy's hidden, no one recognizes us. Tommy holds my hand in his lap the entire car ride over. Even though he is too large for it to be comfortable, he is stationed in the middle seat, right next to me. He holds the door open for me on our way into the Cheesecake Factory. It is not the typical selection for a brunch, but I do not question it. We are the only ones in the restaurant besides an elderly couple. The waitress sits us on the opposite side from them. The woman gives us a smile and a wave as we pass them. Tommy politely waves back. We are seated in a booth. \"Damn.\" Tommy mutters after the waitress walks away. When I glance at him questioningly, he smiles. \"I was counting on pulling out your chair for you.\" I laugh. He seems pleased. Instead of sliding in the opposite bench, he sits next to me. I do not object. I pretend to study my menu for a while, but I am completely focused on the man next to me. The side of his body is pressed flush to mine. I listen to the rhythm of him breathing. His eyes scan over his own menu, pausing every now and again. He looks completely focused as he flips page after page. After a moment he notices me watching him. \"I don't want food.\" He tells me. \"Neither do I.\" I admit. \"Let's get cheesecake. God, I haven't had cake in years.\" He looks longingly at the dessert section. That settles it. We discuss which cake sounds the best before settling on ordering five different flavors (the best as recommended by our waitress). They arrive all at the same time. With a flourish, Tommy shakes out his cloth napkin, tucks it into the neck of his shirt and turns to me. \"Let's do this.\" We laugh and eat cake, pretending that we have forgotten what has brought us together in the first place. It is nice to just talk with no interviews hanging over our head. I am not giving him instructions or arguing about what to say. Tommy is actually smiling, acting silly. He seems young, happy. I am glad I am here to witness it. He asks me the normal first date questions, where I am from, where I went to school, where I live now. Somehow they are more significant though. After nearly a month of prying into his back story, it is nice to share some of mine. \"So, are you dating anyone else?\" he asks, licking chocolate off of his lips. \"It's a little late to be asking that,\" I laugh. I am giddy off of lack of sleep, sugar and his company. \"But no; just you.\" \"Good.\" He leans forward, closing the scant inches between us. He tastes like chocolate and strawberries, with a hint of the pumpkin pie cheesecake he just swallowed. His kiss has more urgency than the last one. His tongue traces my lips and my mouth parts at his command. We are making out in public like a bunch of horny teenagers and I could not care less. Somehow we manage to part long enough to pay the bill, gather up our boxed cheesecake and catch a cab back to the hotel. It takes all of my self control to not jump him in the cab, the lobby or even the elevator. I manage to keep my hand steady enough to slide the keycard into the door. The minute the door clicks shut, Tommy is on me. The leftovers bag gets deposited on the dresser before we begin the awkward dance of disrobing one another. Tommy has an easier job than I do. His hands shove the straps of my dress from my shoulders. Her jerks the material down and it bunches at my waist but he maneuvers it off. It pools at my feet. Tommy lifts me up out of it with his good arm and carries me to the bed. My back hits the mattress and he comes tumbling down over me. \"Your uniform,\" I manage to tell him. I can feel the previously pristine clothing under my back. \"Fuck it,\" he tells me. With a tug, it is out from under me and thrown unceremoniously to the floor. I fumble with his jeans. He is placing extremely distracting wet kisses down the side of my neck and over my chest. I feel my body arch upward without my permission, unconsciously seeking him out. He discards his shirt and kicks his pants off. I help him detangle them from his ankles. I am abruptly struck by the intimacy of what we are doing. The idea that this is just a last thrill before heading off to war enters my mind and I cannot shake it, even as Tommy is igniting my body with his hands. \"Tommy,\" I gasp as his palms skim the bottom of my breasts. \"Yeah?\" his voice is muffled against my skin. \"Would you be doing this, if you weren't—\" \"Getting deployed again?\" he lifts his head long enough to smirk at me. \"I was going to come over here and seduce you no matter how the trial went.\" His cockiness is infuriating, but his answer is comforting. As if to reassure me, he captures my lips in another kiss. \"You've been driving me crazy since we met in that casino. God,\" he groans, rubbing against me. \"I want you.\" I stop asking questions after that. I am grateful for all the time I've spent recently watching MMA because being in bed with Tommy Conlon is like a wrestling match. I hit the mattress so many times in so many different ways that I lose count. By the time it is done, my legs are shaking and I feel like I have some sort of magnificent vertigo. He is lying behind me, his chest pressed to my back, one hand locked firmly around my waist and the other tangled in my mass of hair. He leans forward like he is trying to pull me into him. He drops a kiss on my shoulder. \"You ok?\" somehow I know he is asking about more than my post-coital bliss. I nod slowly. \"Are you?\" I ask quietly. \"No. Not really.\" He admits. I want to turn around to look at his face but I do not seem to have the strength. \"What are you going to miss most?\" I ask. \"I don't know. The little things.\" He exhales. \"Beer, junk food, my family I guess.\" \"You guess?\" \"We were never close. And for the first time, we've got a chance to change that. And I have to go back.\" \"But you'll come back.\" \"Maybe.\" \"You will.\" I grasp his hand tight. \"If I do, I'm still coming back to a pile of shit.\" He says. \"I'm going to need serious therapy.\" It is supposed to be a joke, but we both know better. \"Will you keep in contact with me?\" I ask after a few minutes of silence. \"If you still want to talk to me.\" When I ask why I would not want to talk to him, he continues. \"I'm different over there. You have to be. It's going to be like moving backwards.\" I roll over so that I am facing him. His grey eyes stare into my brown ones. For once, I am the one with nothing to say. There is so much I want to tell him, so much I want him to know, and I cannot even form a single sentence. So I wrap my arms around his neck and kiss him with as much passion as I can muster. He returns the gesture eagerly. We are locked around each other, skin on skin. By the time I pull back we are both gasping for air. \"Thanks,\" he tells me again. \"For everything.\" \"I'd do it again.\" I say. \"I know this is a lot to ask.\" He begins. \"And it's not like we're a couple, or…\" he swallows thickly. I stroke his cheek to urge him to continue. \"Don't forget me while I'm over there, ok?\" It is the last favor he has to ask of me. \"Don't forget me either.\" I tell him. \"I promise.\" He kisses my ear. \"I promise too.\" We drift to sleep in each other's arms.[Chapter 12] Author's Note: Thank you for the reviews and for reading! If you have time, please let me know what you think about this chapter. Tommy is all over the news again. He left the United States to a crowd of supporters and well wishers and even a few protesters. I don't know how it was that they were able to find the time and date of when he was leaving, but they showed up in scores. MMA fans, political aficionados and fan girls brandished signs, played music and blew kisses at the young men and women who will be spending the next year of their life overseas. Tommy only has 6 months to go, but it will be six long, hard months away from home. The emotion in the room was palpable as the soldiers waved goodbye. I was not there. I was in the newsroom at ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut, pretending to be focusing on my job. Very few people know where I spent my last few weeks and I am in no hurry to tell them. Gavin keeps cornering me with questions, demanding that I fill him in on his two new favorite fighters. I give him the outer details, basically reiterating what has already been said on television. He seems to realize something is up. Eventually, I suppose I will have to tell him. He is too sharp to stay in the dark for too long. But I am afraid that if I talk about it now, I might burst into tears. I have not cried at all since that day in Arlington, and I am not planning on it. Tommy certainly did not need to spend the last few hours with me trying to talk me off the edge, and it will not serve anyone if I fall into some sort of depression. I will continue on as if nothing is bothering me and hopefully, in six months, Tommy will be home. Not that his home is with me. He will go back to Pittsburgh while I remain here. I do not know what will happen between us at that point, but for now, I know that I will email and snail mail and Skype with him. We agreed to keep in contact that day in the hotel. His family was due back at any moment, necessitating that we at least put our clothing back on. Before I relinquished him back into the arms of his hysterical relatives, Tommy gave me a lingering kiss and reiterated his promise. And now, I will keep calm, carry on, and eagerly anticipate any contact with him. The first email arrives just as the leaves begin to change. It is already chilly in Connecticut. I rush back into the studio from my car, bundled up against the cold. It is beautiful outside, a sea of oranges and reds and browns. Tourists will be flocking in soon. It is a slow week in the sports world, just the usual line up of football games and speculation on the upcoming NBA season. I have got some highlight reels to voiceover, but nothing too tough. I click on my heels through the lobby of ESPN headquarters, a huge bag of Chipotle swinging from one arm. Gavin agreed to start the editing if I picked up lunch. I wind through cubicles until I get to the editing bays. We are not technically allowed to eat there, but I slide the door shut, lower the blinds and sit down. \"I got you a burrito in a bowl,\" I swing the bag down and start rooting through it. It is not until I notice that Gavin is staring at me that I take a long look at him. \"What?\" One bushy black eyebrow is arched and his arms are crossed over his chest. Gavin strikes an imposing figure at the most normal of times. He is over 6 feet tall, barrel chested and built like a bull. Most people assume he is one of the athletes and not just the camera man. \"You left your email open.\" He tells me. A smirk is starting to form. \"So?\" I shrug out of my pea coat and hang it on the chair. I frequently leave my email open while at work and I generally have no problem with Gavin taking a glance at it now and again. Normally, it is just a note on some story. \"Why is Tommy Conlon emailing you from Iraq?\" he comes to his point at last. \"What?\" I leap over him and to the monitor. In a second I have the window up. I frantically click the mouse to open the message. I am sprawled halfway across Gavin's lap. As I scan the words of Tommy's email a giant grin splits my face. I have not heard from him in a week, not since the night before he left. \"I knew it!\" Gavin throws his hands up like a Baptist choir. \"I knew it!\" he repeats. \"Knew what?\" I am slightly irritated that he is interrupting my reading. \"I can't believe you didn't tell me you were sleeping with him!\" I hush him hurriedly. He lowers his voice, but continues his interrogation. \"After I helped you dig that dirt up on him,\" he puts on a mock pout. \"I thought we were friends.\" Resigning myself to finally telling someone, I sigh. \"Fine, it was just once.\" I say. \"Must have been a helluva time for him to be emailing you a novel like that.\" He gestures to the lengthy email. \"Did you read it?\" I feel my face heat up. There were some…personal details included in that text. \"Didn't have to.\" Gavin wrenches the top off of his food. \"You just turned maroon.\" I blush more. I settle for dignified silence and decide to focus on eating while I scan the rest of the letter. I will have to write back in the privacy of my own home. \"So, are you guys dating?\" Gavin asks around a mouthful of black beans. \"Not right now.\" I pick at my food. \"Well obviously,\" Gavin rolls his eyes. As large as he is, the gesture always looks a bit absurd. \"When he gets back?\" \"We haven't planned ahead that far.\" I say. \"So you, what, just fell into bed with the guy?\" I shrug. Gavin groans. \"I thought women were supposed to gush about emotions.\" \"You hate it when I gush,\" I tell him. \"And now, the one time I want details, you won't give them.\" He does not sound truly angry. In an attempt to change the subject I move my hand back to the mouse and start pulling out sports highlights. Gavin takes my point. We resume working in the well-worn and efficient way that is our signature. It is a relatively comfortable silence, or it would be, if Gavin would stop looking at me and laughing every few minutes. \"Answer me this one question,\" he says finally, \"was it good?\" \"You've seen him fight?\" I ask in return. Gavin nods. \"It was like that,\" Gavin's eyes widen with concern and I feel compelled to add, \"But not painful.\" \"My God,\" Gavin bursts out laughing. Every time he gains composure he looks at me and guffaws again. Tears are streaming down his cheeks. \"Good for you,\" he chortles in between laughs, \"Good for you.\" It takes everything in me to not rush out of the door and speed home. I force myself to cautiously navigate the winding roads that take me to my house. I'm relieved as I turn into my block. My home laptop is practically screaming my name. I throw my front door open, take a minute to hang my jacket on the hooks in the foyer and rush into my living room. My laptop is situated on a small, oval, Ikea coffee table sandwiched between two tan suede couches. The couches are faded and beginning to fray a little bit and there is a stain on the coffee table where I once spilled nail polish remover. My living room will not be winning any prizes in Better Homes and Gardens anytime soon, but it is my home, the place where I am most comfortable. While my laptop takes ages to update, I fix myself some tea, change out of my work clothes and load my dishwasher. I am dying to read Tommy's letter. I pull up the text while the evening news hums quietly from my television in the background. The backlash over the Marine Corps decision to send Tommy back has been tremendous. It has set off protests and angry arguments on both sides. None of this, I realize, will change the fact that Tommy is in Iraq, but it might change something for the next generation. Congress is debating imposing mandatory limits on how many tours a soldier can complete in a 3-year period and there has even been some talk on enforcing mandatory counseling for everyone who has been to war. I've been watching as much coverage on the issues as I can stand, but I am a little worn out from the sheer emotion of it all. Now, I mute the television and turn to my computer. This letter is longer than anything I would ever expect from Tommy. He reports that he is fine. It is hot in Iraq, but relatively quiet. He confides that he is uncomfortable with the attention he receives from the younger men. He feels a need to be a role model, but he just wants to be left alone and get through this. Instead he is running wrestling clinics in his downtime and become a kind of counselor. It seems he is not the only one with family problems. He tells me he has not volunteered any personal information on himself, but that he should start charging by the half hour for all the listening he is doing. I can hear his voice in my mind as clearly as if he was talking to me. I can hear the inflections, the parts where he would trail off or mumble, even picture his shrugs and eye rolls. He signs the letter with a simple \"Tommy\". I am about to scroll up to respond when I see his post script. It simply says \"P.S. I miss you.\" I grin at my computer like the Cheshire Cat. It is like being in high school again, liking your first boy and analyzing his every move. I want to gush to someone, maybe Gavin tomorrow. Gavin at least can keep a secret. I type back my response, including information on what has been going on in the MMA world and at work. I feel elated as I write. I type and delete, add and omit. It is like writing a novel. A half hour later I finally feel comfortable enough to hit the send icon. And then I wait. Over the next few weeks, Tommy and I fall into a pattern of regular communication. Tommy's letters come at all hours of the day, in all different lengths. Sometimes they are a quick anecdote on something that happened to him; sometimes they are longer tales, witty diatribes of Marine hijinks. Occasionally they are serious. He tells about deaths, explosions. The details in these letters are always scarce, as if he is afraid to reminisce too much. He keeps me informed from late August until Halloween. Our correspondences are like punctuation marks on my day. It is a delight to read a message when I'm crowded in a tunnel, hoping the player I need to interview walks by and stops in front of me. It provides a distraction when work gets monotonous, when my producer decides to chew out everyone in the office, when my brother calls to complain about his wife. It feels as though Tommy belongs uniquely to me; I hear people inquire about him from time to time, ask what he is doing for a quick ten second spot on Sports Center. I keep the details to myself. Let them run the clip of him waving sullenly at a camera from the Middle East. Let Tommy keep his reputation as a hard ass. I will maintain my reputation for professionalism. It is a win- win. Halloween is bitterly cold and snowing so trick or treaters are scarce this year. I am holed up in my house with the fireplace going. My oldest brother, Michael, is talking to me on the phone. He and his wife are having problems. I am sympathetic, but I wish there was someone else he could vent these emotions to. He tells me that I am the only one who offers objective advice; his guy friends are telling him to cut his losses and out younger brother tells him to be a man and just suck it up. And so it is me who takes his calls a few times a week. \"I think we need to get out, go somewhere alone to reconnect,\" he tells me. I suggested the exact same thing two weeks ago, but I murmur the affirmative. It takes Michael a while to accept advice, especially from his kid sister. Michael got married right out of college to his school sweetheart. Angela is a nice woman, and the first decade or so of their marriage went off without any major hitches. But now their son (and my nephew) Luke is in his preteens and has become something of a little terror. It took them a while to get pregnant, and after a number of miscarriages, Luke was the only child they could have naturally. Angela has always been sensitive to that fact, treating Luke like a baby boy. Michael is hard on Luke, Angela coddles him and it is driving a wedge between them. I personally think that Luke's discipline issues are nothing that cannot be solved with a firm hand, but then again, Michael and I had the same upbringing. \"I'm thinking we can go somewhere over Christmas break.\" \"Mom and Dad are going to take Luke?\" I ask. I am distracted by something on television, an announcement of some kind by the president. \"I kind of promised Luke a white Christmas.\" Michael suddenly sounds ashamed. \"Mike,\" I groan. We were born and raised in Los Angeles, CA, a place where we had a better shot of running into Ice Cube then seeing any actual ice falling from the sky. \"You don't have to. I know you're busy. We can take him with us or—\" \"I'll do it,\" I kick myself. Michael is clearly relieved. \"He's always asking about you. Maybe you can take him to work with you one day. Luke loves sports.\" My attention is back on the television. A lower third has just run under an image of the president. \"Mike,\" I interrupt him mid sentence. \"Are you watching the news?\" \"Yeah, they keep talking about the president.\" He transitions with me to the next subject, perhaps guilty for imposing on me. \"What's he saying?\" \"Something about pulling out of Iraq. We should be completely out of there by Christmas.\" It is like a white light goes off in my brain. The troops, the president is saying, should all be stateside for New Years Day. Tommy is coming home. He is coming home early. My stomach does a strange sort of swoop. I conjure up images of what he will look like when he finds out. I want to be the one who breaks the news, but of course, I know someone else must have told them already, some authority figure. Still, I am elated. Mike hangs up when his wife returns. The phone is still hot in my hand as I dial the number for Brendan and Tess in Philadelphia. Tess is practically screaming into the phone with happiness. She reports that Brendan and Paddy are already trying to get into contact with Tommy. She asks if I would like to come to his \"welcome home\" party. She's spouting off details and plans, sounding as happy as I am. My affection for her grows. She really is a ride or die supporter of her husband's family. Brendan talks to me briefly. It is clear he is as elated as his wife is. He says that Tommy called already and said he is excited to be returning home. I hang up the phone and check my email. There are no new messages. I suppose that the time difference is to blame and fall into bed, elated. I dream of Tommy's homecoming, what I will say when I see him. My alarm goes off and before I have even started my coffee, I am checking my email. There is nothing. A day goes by, and then a week, and then another. No word from Tommy comes, no old-fashioned notes in the mail, no emails, or Skype calls. I call Tess to see if she has heard from him. She says that Brendan got a quick call, but nothing in the last few days. I am torn between being panicked for his well-being, angry at his brush off and sad. I confide these feelings to Gavin. He tells me to stop being such a girl and just kick Tommy's ass when he gets back. His idea has appeal. I move myself firmly into the angry camp. I am a jilted woman, but I refuse to show it. My work production increases ten-fold. I throw myself into getting the story with a passion that surprises even me. Every interview is a little victory, a little balm to soothe the burn Tommy dealt me. I am even unfazed when my producer instructs me to do a story on his homecoming and what it means for the world of MMA. \"You sure you want to do this?\" Gavin asks for the umpteenth time. I am flying to Philly with my cameraman Nick to get footage of the prodigal son's return. \"I'll be fine.\" \"It's going to look really bad when you slap the shit out of him on live television,\" Gavin jokes. I shoot him a look that could kill. \"Hey,\" he holds his palms up. \"Save that for Conlon.\" \"I'm going to be cool,\" I tell him. \"As a cucumber.\" He looks amused at my predicament. \"Exactly.\" I say. I repeat the mantra to myself as we travel. Cool as a cucumber. Cool as a cucumber. It carries me all the way to the Conlon house. The minute the modest little family home comes into view, I feel my stomach drop. I am beginning to panic. \"You ok?\" Nick looks at me with concern. \"Yeah. Just a little carsick.\" I try to smile. Nick looks convinced, but subtly scoots farther away from me. \"Just try not to throw up.\" He says. \"Right.\" I agree. I contemplate just refusing to get out of the car for the briefest of seconds. Then I take a deep breath, calm myself and put my reporter face on. It got me through my first meeting with Tommy, it can get me through my last. Cool as a cucumber, I repeat to myself. \"Ready?\" Nick doesn't wait for my response before he rings the doorbell. \"As I'll ever be,\" I say truthfully. We stand on the front porch, listening to the scuffling on the inside. For better or for worse, in an hour, it will all be over.[Chapter 13] Author's Note: Thank you for the reviews and for reading! You guys are amazing. It is bitterly cold on the front porch and Nick is already beginning to complain. Philadelphia, though brimming with history, is also full of some of the dreariest weather and down on their luck people to be found. It is a place where the Conlon family is not a unique one. However, Brendan and Tess's home is in a more pleasant suburb a little ways outside the smog of the city. From the look of the yard, it has grass during the warm weather. Now it's covered in ice. The brown remains of the lawn glitter under the afternoon light like jewels. \"It's freezing!\" Nick groans. His breath frosts in a cloud in front of us. He stamps his feet on the porch. \"How long are they going to make us wait?\" To appease him, I ring the bell again though I can hear someone already making their way to the door. \"Nicole!\" Tess smiles at me though she looks distinctly harried. \"It's really nice to see you,\" she waves us inside. Nick practically plows through the door, camera equipment in tow. I shoot him a warning glance to remind him to be polite. He seems not to see it. \"Gotta get the rest of the equipment.\" He rushes back outside without so much as an introduction. Tess looks unfazed. \"It's a little hectic in here.\" Tess apologizes. Her hair is half down, wavy on one side and stick straight on the other. She also is still wearing sweat pants. \"I had to get the girls ready.\" She says by way of explanation. \"Brendan and Pop are with Tommy,\" she leads me inside the living room. I notice her use of the term \"pop\". I take it as a sign that they have healed the rift between them. In comparison to her ensemble, the living room is pristine. It has been polished and shined until it is sparkling, everything in its proper order. It is clear that some of the money that Brendan won has gone to renovations. Beautiful wood floors gleam, tasteful throw rugs accent the furniture and match the throw pillows on the couches. Even the light fixtures look brand new. It is the perfect place to shoot an interview. \"You have a beautiful house,\" I compliment. I know that saving this house was why Brendan entered Sparta to begin with. Tess beams. \"Thanks. It's not much, but it's home.\" \"Where do I set up?\" Nick returns, interrupts our conversation, and crassly drops his equipment on the hardwood floor. Tess tells him anywhere is fine and he starts working immediately. I have quickly learned that the easiest way to help Nick is to back up and let him do his thing, so I set about wandering aimlessly, glancing at family pictures. The photographs on the walls and shelves feature mostly the Conlon girls, but a few pictures are from longer back, including some wedding photos and even a prom shot of Brendan and Tess. I note a more recent photo of Paddy and his granddaughters posed in front of Rockefeller Center. My heart seems to stop when I glance a picture of Tommy. He is stationed in a sunny dessert in a drab t-shirt and khakis. He is smiling his odd little half smile. His eyes are covered in aviators and he looks every inch the Marine. I have not seen him in months and this picture stops me in my tracks. The fact that he and I will be face to face within minutes, that he is probably in the same building that I am now, sinks in. \"Do you mind if I finish getting dressed?\" Tess does not seem to notice my predicament. Startled, I nod, attempting a smile. It must look incredibly forced, because Tess gives me a weird look. \"I think the men are done dressing. If you want to see them.\" She tells me. \"They probably didn't hear you guys arrive.\" \"Sure. It'll be nice.\" I sound as though I am being strangled. Tess squints at me. \"Tommy was asking about you.\" She says. Her eyes seem to be assessing me. \"Really?\" I try to remain cool. \"He said you guys talked while he was overseas.\" She is working her way to her point. \"Every once in a while, yes.\" I swallow thickly. Tess looks unconvinced. \"I think he'll be happy to see you.\" She says pointedly. \"His last month over there was kind of rough.\" It is my turn to be confused. \"Why?\" Tess looks at me hard. \"Go ask him for yourself,\" she says, not unkindly. She points down a narrow hall. I nod and watch her disappear up the stairs. She shouts something up at her daughters who have begun to bump around in what I guess must be their room. I glance quickly at Nick and tell him I will be back. He barely looks up at me while he winds heavy cables around the corners of the living room. Every step down that hallway feels like my feet are made of lead. My anger abated the moment Tess insinuated that something was wrong with Tommy. He had looked fine in the footage of him returning at the airport, but then again, I had not analyzed it thoroughly. Maybe it is an emotional kind of hurt. I feel suddenly selfish for focusing only on me the last few weeks. It was easier to be angry than worry. Now I am sick with it. I knock on the door Tess pointed to. I hear men's voices inside. They stop abruptly. The knob turns and the door swing open, exposing a grinning Brendan. I am being swung into a hug before I even fully register his appearance. \"Nicole.\" He crushes the breath out of me. \"Hello Brendan,\" I wheeze. \"Shit, sorry,\" he lets go. I have to laugh. He looks so absurdly happy. His face seems decades younger since Sparta. The absence of bruises probably helps, but there is also an air of a man who is living the dream. In just a few months, nearly everything Brendan Conlon has ever wanted fell into his lap and it shows. Paddy is the next up. He hugs me a little awkwardly. He too, looks happy. He has his granddaughters and now, both of his sons. I do not know the details of how their relationship is progressing, but if his smile is any indication, it is going well. \"Hey Nicole,\" the voice I now would know anywhere speaks my name. Tommy smiles at me from behind his brother. Almost involuntarily, my eyes sweep over every inch of him, looking for any indication that something is wrong. I almost miss it, but as I come to his neck, there is a corner of fabric peaking out at his neckline. It looks like a bandage. \"What happened to your neck?\" I have not so much as said hello and I'm already berating him. So much for being cool. Brendan and Paddy look alarmed but Tommy gives his brother a level-headed look. Brendan takes his nonverbal cue. \"Come on Pop. The girls have been too quiet.\" He smiles at us and leads his father out of the room. The minute the door closes, I am on Tommy. Gingerly, I reach out and tug his black thermal down, exposing a large tan bandage. It is stained pink in the middle. I am terrified of what it might be covering. \"Oh my God, Tommy.\" I can't seem to arrange my thoughts. He is hurt. He is hurt and he didn't tell me. \"Nice to see you too, Nicole.\" He seems on the verge of laughter. His hand comes up to mine and gently coaxes me into letting go of the fabric of his clothing. \"Tommy,\" I bring myself to look him in the eye. \"I guess I owe you an explanation, huh?\" he seems unconcerned. My expression makes it clear that he does. \"I caught some shrapnel about three weeks ago. It hit me in the chest and some of my neck. I spent the last few weeks under medical care.\" He shrugs, \"I don't think they wanted me to die. It'd look bad in the press.\" He says lightly. \"You took shrapnel to the neck,\" I am having trouble processing this. \"What were you doing?\" \"War.\" He says simply. I feel faint. Tommy realizes something is wrong. \"Hey,\" he says quietly, pulling me into his chest. \"I'm fine. It's ok.\" I squeeze his hand tightly. \"Why didn't you say anything?\" \"I was under strict orders. I only had contact with immediate family. That was pretty much Pop.\" He says apologetically. I feel awful. \"I was so mad at you.\" I tell him. \"I thought—\" \"Yeah,\" he says. \"I figured you might. I was kind of counting on Brendan telling you. I guess he dropped the ball on that one.\" I begin to laugh with relief. It is like a knot in my stomach unties and releases. \"I'm glad you're back.\" I say. \"I'm glad to be back.\" He says. Tommy has seemed to reach the maximum word quota for the hour because instead of saying anything more, he yanks me as close to him as possible and kisses me. All the words I had to say flee from my mind and I focus solely on feeling. I grasp him through the thick cotton of his long sleeved shirt, flattening my palms over his biceps. His hand comes up and cups my chin, pulling my face into his. Kissing him again is like water after a drought. Every nerve in my body relaxes. I sigh against his lips. He must take this as a good sign because his other hand snakes its way down my back, careful to feel every inch of me on its decent. It finds rest on the small of my back, just above the swell of my bottom. I drag my fingers down his arms and to the hem of his shirt. I slide them under, tracing the warm skin and hard muscle. He's lost some weight, but the definition is still there. I take a mental inventory with my hands, confirming to myself that he is still intact. My fingers brush the bottom of his bandage right above his belly button. His injury is worse than he is telling me. I pull back from the kiss. \"What?\" he asks when he sees my serious look. \"Take your shirt off.\" I instruct. He smirks. \"I'd love to, but don't we have to work in a minute?\" \"Tommy,\" his smile fades. \"How badly are you hurt?\" \"I told you I'm fine.\" \"Prove it.\" I challenge. \"Let me see.\" We become engaged in a staring contest. I refuse to break first. I realize that he has been through hell, but it has not been easy for the people he left back here either. I am not about to let him shut me out. Tommy sighs. \"Fine.\" He lifts the hem of his shirt up just below his neck. It takes everything in me to not gasp. The bandage is massive, covering nearly a quarter of his torso. \"Tommy,\" I begin. It is difficult to speak. Nick shouting my name from the living room sends me crashing back to reality. For a moment, I forgot I was here to work. \"We'll talk after the interview?\" I phrase it like a question, though it is more of a demand. \"I promise.\" He tugs his shirt back down. \"You'll tell me everything?\" I ask again. \"If you want to hear it.\" \"Tommy,\" I say seriously. \"I always want to hear it. Even when it's bad.\" He sucks on his teeth and stares at me. I sense that he is coming to some conclusion. \"All right.\" He says. \"We'll talk.\"[Chapter 14] Tommy is shirtless in my bed, but it certainly is not as fun as the last time around. I have unscrewed the top of the hotel lampshade off and am angling the light at the right side of his body. Tommy is gingerly lifting the bandage off. It's obvious he's trying not to wince. With every exposed inch, I feel my stomach roil. His torso is a roadmap of bruises and swelling, criss-crossed with deep gashes and puncture wounds. I am trying to picture exactly what could have caused it. There is a large laceration surrounded by many tinier cuts. It's in various states of healing, coloring his skin yellow and black in some areas, purple in other. Some cuts appear to still be seeping. I feel like I am about to pass out. \"You should have seen it when it first happened.\" Tommy grimaces as he leans backwards. \"What did happen?\" \"Car bomb. I was standing too close.\" He says in a perfectly level voice. It is the tone he uses when he goes away inside and shuts down. It's like he is reading a text book, or reciting lines. \"How many people died?\" I hate to ask the hard questions, but I have to know. \"12.\" He clips out. \"8 were Iraqi. The rest were our guys.\" He begins to roll the bandage back down. \"You were in the hospital how long?\" I help him with his task. It seems easier to focus on that roll of tan fabric than look one another in the eye. \"I was out for two days.\" He says. I swallow thickly, but do not speak. \"When I woke up my ears were ringing and I thought my skin was on fire.\" His hand finds mine almost unconsciously. I squeeze it tightly. \"I had the best medical care I could get out there. And by the time I was healthy enough to get back out, the president was bringing us home.\" I silently process this information. His hand works to cover his wounds but I stop it. I am fascinated by the way his cuts weave in and out of his tattoos. His skin is like a diary of his life so far; major moments are marked in ink and scar tissue. I have a million more questions to ask but they seem stuck in my throat. I content myself with just running my fingers across his skin. It is a coppery color from the desert sun and it prickles with goose bumps as I trace the tribal design on his bicep. \"What are you going to do now?\" the question encompasses everything I want to ask. \"Heal.\" He answers. \"Get back in shape.\" \"To fight again?\" \"Yup.\" He tucks the last of the bandage back over his collarbone. I study a tattoo of two masks on his chest, with the caption \"laugh now, cry later\". It seems to be a motto of sorts for him. \"Where are you going to stay?\" I ask. He shrugs. \"Here. Maybe with Pop.\" I let go of his hand and stand up. \"What?\" he asks. \"Nothing. It's just…\" I try to think of a way to phrase this that isn't insulting. I come up blank. \"Should you be fighting so soon?\" he gives me a baffled look. \"I mean, should you go to therapy…or something?\" He looks angry. I fear I have overstepped my boundary. \"Fighting is my therapy.\" He looks so furious that I become afraid. Acting on reflex, I step backwards away from him, palms up and out. \"All right,\" I do not recognize my voice, it is so small. The anger melts from his face. He looks completely ashamed. \"Nicole,\" he reaches out for me, but I do not take his hand. \"Come on,\" he gestures to me, his voice gentle. \"I'm sorry.\" I approach cautiously, the way one might walk towards a feral animal. The moment I am close enough to him, his hands encircle my waist. He drags me down into his lap, but I do not lean into his chest. I am terrified to hurt him, but also of what he might become. I think about Paddy, about what I have heard about him and who he used to be. \"Tommy,\" I say quietly. \"You need to get help.\" He is silent so I continue. \"Before this gets worse.\" \"Before I get like, Pop, you mean?\" he does not sound angry. He takes my silence for confirmation. \"I don't think it's going to matter.\" He says. \"Of course it will,\" I brace my hands on his shoulders. \"Therapy can help you get over things, in a healthy way.\" He shakes his head. \"The only time I feel ok is when I'm training. When I'm focused on that, I'm not thinking about anything else. I'm not drinking, I'm not popping pills. I take care of myself. And I'm too tired at night to even have nightmares.\" I try again. \"Can't you do both?\" \"Baby,\" it is the first time he has ever called me a pet name. \"You've got to let me do things my way.\" I have nothing more to say. Tommy is a mess, and I am not enough to pick up the pieces and put them back together. His hurt is more than I can heal. All at once I feel like crying. Embarrassed, I lift myself out of his lap and begin to pace around the room. Needing to be alone before I break down, I rush for the bathroom. My eyes are burning and I quickly turn on the faucet and wet my face. Over the rush of the water I hear Tommy walking around. Maybe he is leaving. I do not have the strength to stop him. I am so emotionally involved at this point that it frightens me. Nothing is ever easy with the Conlons, especially Tommy. But I had hoped he'd be willing to cooperate when he got back. I do not want him to turn to substances, like many veterans before him. I do not want to hear a story a few years from now about a breakdown he has had. I do not want to watch him at MMA events, hard and shut down, expressing himself through violence. I do not want rage and anger to be his safe place. I hear his footsteps and a door opening. A moment later, he is behind me. \"Nicole,\" he says with authority. I stall, choosing to wet a washcloth and press it to my face rather than look at him. I am struck by the thought that I have run willingly into a train wreck. There is nothing I can say or do to fix the situation. \"Nicole, listen to me.\" He coaxes the cloth from my hand and tosses it to the counter. It lands with a wet slap. \"I know you want to help. I like that you want to help.\" He lifts my chin with his hand. \"You've done a ton for me, probably too much. But you can't do it all.\" \"I know,\" I sigh, deflated. \"This isn't the first time I've come back. I know what works.\" He is firm but not angry. \"I just want you to be ok,\" I need him to understand my position. \"I'm probably never going to be normal.\" He says pointblank. \"But I'm not going to go crazy either.\" The statement sits between us for a long while. \"Fighting really helps?\" I ask at last. \"Yeah.\" He looks at me. \"It does.\" \"Is it the only thing?\" \"Nah,\" he shoots me a sly grin. \"There's other things. Talking to you, for example.\" He has turned his seductive side back on. I sense it is a way for him to end the conversation, but I am not finished. \"Sex isn't therapy, Tommy.\" I say. \"No?\" he leans down to nibble on my earlobe. I feel a streak of pleasure run down my spine. \"Tommy,\" I brace my hands against his chest and push. He moves back all of a centimeter, but takes my point. \"What are we doing here?\" \"I can tell you what I wish we were doing here.\" His response irritates me. I try to twist my way out of his arms, but he holds me still. I am struck by how strong he is. He leans down until his face is millimeters away from me. \"Nicole,\" he says seriously. \"You know I'm shit with words.\" I am in no way going to dispute this. \"Cut me some slack,\" he says. When I look unconvinced, he continues. \"I need you here. I want you here.\" \"I can't stay,\" I say honestly. \"Then I'll visit you.\" He says. He winds his arm back around my waist. \"For how long?\" I try not to focus on the sensations he is causing. \"As long as you want me.\" He pulls me into his chest. \"And what, I'll go to your fights? Cheer you on?\" I'm speaking into his shirt. \"I'd be cool with that.\" He drops a kiss against my neck. \"That sounds like a girlfriend.\" I say. My heart stops as I wait for his response. He smiles against my neck. \"Do you want to be my girlfriend?\" \"I'd think that's obvious.\" I say. He begins to laugh. I feel myself begin to get fired up. \"Relax,\" he chuckles. \"You've got a worse temper than I do.\" \"Just thank God I'm not some bad ass fighter. Or I'd hit you.\" I bounce my fist off of one of his arms. \"I can teach you some moves.\" He catches my hand. Before I even register what he is doing, I am being picked up, flipped over and marched back into the room. Laughter bubbles from my lips. He drops me on the bed in a move I have only ever seen in WWE. I try to kick free, but he pins my legs. We are rolling across the mattress. I am giggling, content. By the time he manages to get me to stop wiggling I am completely out of breath. \"Tap out,\" he instructs. \"No,\" I stubbornly begin to wiggle again, but only succeed in rubbing my body along his. \"Tap out,\" he repeats, applying slight pressure on my lower body. An idea strikes me. \"I will, if you promise me something.\" \"What?\" he looks intrigued. \"You'll go to therapy.\" He begins to roll his eyes but I continue. \"Maybe just once a month. In three months, if you don't like it then stop.\" He looks down at me. \"What do I get?\" I hook one arm behind his neck and arch my body into his. \"I'll be your girl.\" When he looks skeptical, I add, \"it comes with certain…perks.\" He considers this. \"You really want me to go.\" It is not a question but I nod anyway. He bites his lip, thinking. I content myself with stroking his hair. It is still severely short, but the jarhead cut is beginning to grow out. The new hair is impossibly soft, like baby bird feathers. He closes his eyes and sighs, leaning his head into my hand. He looks like a puppy. \"I'll go.\" He says at last. I smile hugely and try to kiss him, but he stops me. \"Not for the perks,\" he continues, \"But because it means a lot to you.\" The moment this leaves his mouth, he flushed beat red. He attempts to roll off of me, but I move with him. He ends up sitting with his back against the headboard and me in his lap. \"Thank you,\" it is my turn to thank him for once. I lean my head against his good shoulder. \"Anything for my girl,\" he manages to sound grumpy about it, but the tenderness with which he kisses me says otherwise. \"Do you still want the perks?\" I try my hand at being seductive and whisper in his ear. His face splits into a devilish grin as he rolls us both over.[Chapter 15] Author's Note: You guys are the best. I'm glad you're all reading this still. And thanks for all the wonderful reviews. \"Did you pick one?\" I am stationed in my front yard, bundled against the cold, my phone in one hand, the other hand working on covering my plants against the frost. \"Pick what?\" Tommy's voice asks. \"Tommy,\" I sigh. It is taking some time to adjust to his sense of humor. Piece by piece, his hard exterior is beginning to crumble, giving way to a dry humor I did not know he possessed. I love it when he shows me this side, but it is hard to identify at times. Like now, for instance. \"Relax,\" he laughs on the other end of the line. \"I've found one.\" \"And you made an appointment?\" I hate how much I sound like I am nagging, but Tommy doesn't do things unless prodded into it. \"I made an appointment.\" He echoes me. \"What's going on over there?\" \"I'm trying to stop my plants from freezing,\" I curse as the sheet blows off my rose bush. \"That's probably a lost cause.\" Tommy says. \"Especially if the weather is anything like here.\" \"It's it freezing?\" I ask. \"It's so cold I can juice oranges with my nipples,\" he says. The absurdity of his statement sends me into hysterics. \"You know,\" I tell him, \"Once the temperature dips below 40, I'm pretty sure you're supposed to stop running in a tank top.\" \"Who made up that rule?\" \"Nature.\" I say. \"Did nature also tell you to cover your plants in blankets?\" he asks. \"Touché,\" he has me there. I resign myself to planting a new garden in the spring. \"Are you on your way home?\" I ask back in the warmth of my own house. \"I'm going to go to the gym for a little. Then Brendan wants me over for dinner.\" He says. Behind him in the background a car honks and he curses. \"No one can drive in this damn city,\" he laments. I start heating water for tea. \"What are you doing over the weekend?\" it is Friday night. \"Going to that damn appointment you made me make,\" I can almost hear him sticking his tongue out at me. \"And then I don't know. Being a bum probably. You?\" \"Enjoying the quiet.\" I tell him. \"My nephew will be here Sunday.\" \"How long is he staying?\" \"A whole week.\" I explain the situation to Tommy. \"Nice to know that I'm not the only one with family problems.\" \"Yours seem to be going away.\" I say. \"More or less. Tess and I still get into it every once in a while. And sometimes we try to have dinner and no one talks.\" I can picture this perfectly. It makes me want to giggle, but I bite my tongue. \"How's your dad?\" \"Pop's fine.\" He says. \"Happy. He's always at Brendan's house now. I think he wants to sell the old place and move closer to his grandkids.\" \"What do you think about that?\" \"I don't know,\" Tommy mumbles. \"There's a lot of memories in that old shack, but most of them are bad. So I guess it wouldn't be that big of a deal.\" Despite what he says, I know that the thought upsets him. I try to steer his focus elsewhere. \"Are you going to get your own place?\" I know he is splitting time between his brother's house and his dad's. \"I'm in no hurry.\" He says. \"I can bounce around between them and they seem happy.\" \"You're welcome to visit me here, too.\" I say. \"Once I pick a car that can make that drive, I'll be up there more than you want me.\" He tells me. Tommy recently got sponsored by a few different companies to fight. He would not have bothered with them, but he needs the money. I do not think they will ever get a commercial out of him, but he will wear their gear and glower, and that's good enough for them. Now he has change in his pocket and they have a poster boy the nation already loves. \"Well, pick a car fast.\" I say. He begins to laugh. \"You want me up there really bad, don't you sweetheart?\" \"Whatever,\" it's not my best comeback. \"You know you miss me too.\" \"Maybe.\" He says cryptically. I tell him if we were face to face, I would smack him. \"That's not much motivation to come up there and see you.\" He laughs. \"I could probably think of one or two things that might get you up here. Just give me a second.\" His laughter continues. It is quickly becoming one of my favorite sounds in the world. Lord knows it was scarcely heard in the past few years. \"I'll see you soon, babe.\" He says. \"Sooner than you know.\" \"I'm holding you to that.\" I tell him before we hang up. \"Tell me how your appointment goes.\" \"You'll be the first to know.\" He promises. As I go about my day's errands, I contemplate Tommy entering therapy. I do not know what I am expecting to happen; it certainly won't be a quick fix, or a cure all. But maybe it will help. He seems happier by leaps and bounds now, but there are still moments where he slides back into the darkness. He had nightmares the night we spent together in Philadelphia and Tess confided to me that it is not an isolated incident. As far as any of us can tell, he is clean on substances. It is a good step in the right direction. Now we just have to help him continue down that road. Tommy has a great support group. The widow and children of his fallen friend Manny came to visit him the moment he returned state side. They spent over a week with him, treating him to a road trip from Philly to Texas, a way to say thank you for the gift he gave them. He seemed to return a changed man. He smiles more, is quicker to laugh and even joke. While training, he is still the beast he always was, but his personal life is something entirely different. He is molding into a person I only saw glimpses of before he left. He is unfailingly polite, great with his nieces, and apparently (according to Brendan) the kid he used to be. And aside from being a few hundred miles away, he is a pretty fantastic boyfriend. I make the bed in my guest room and run through my house again, making sure it is preteen boy proof. I have my X Box set up (it normally sits idly), snacks in the cupboards and fridge and any late night shows on my cable blocked. I am in the kitchen starting to make dinner when someone knocks on my door. I contemplate letting it go unanswered when the knock sounds again, this time much more insistent. I peak through the peephole and nearly fall over. \"Tommy?\" I swing the door open. He is bundled up in a black NorthFace jacket and a beanie that covers his dark hair. He smiles at me. \"Surprise,\" he says. I nearly tackle him into my frosted over yard. He catches me, but we both fall off of my front step. We plunge backwards, destroying one of the bushes I was earlier trying to save. When we manage to right ourselves, Tommy's Timberlands have managed to completely obliterate my landscaping. \"Sorry!\" I tell him. \"What are you doing here? Weren't you just in Philly?\" Our conversation ended only a few hours ago. \"I was just outside of it, actually.\" He follows me into my house, graciously not acknowledging my loss of decorum a moment ago. He gestures back to the driveway where a brand new black Dodge truck is parked. \"Perk of having sponsors,\" he explains as I ogle the car. \"I got it Wednesday.\" \"Why didn't you tell me?\" I help him shrug out of his huge coat. \"I wanted to surprise you.\" He pulls his hat off and runs a hand through his mussed hair. \"So I made an appointment for a shrink up here. I figure if I've got to do this, I can at least sleep over with you the night before.\" He shrugs and bends down to untie his boots. \"Aw, you did miss me,\" I tease. He glances up at me. \"Nah. I just really wanted to take my new car for a ride.\" \"A four hour one?\" I ask. \"I really love that new car smell.\" He tells me. I tackle him again, this time managing to get on his back and push him to the ground. It is a matter of milliseconds before he gains the upper hand, flips me around and puts me in a sort of headlock. \"You've got to stop being so violent. Maybe you're the one who needs therapy.\" He chastises. \"Stop being such a smart ass, then.\" I tell him. I squirm to get free and he lets me. We go down on the rug in my foyer. \"It's easier being a smart ass then a sensitive guy.\" He says. \"Cut me some slack.\" \"Fair enough.\" I lean down and kiss him, my hands roving across his chest. I am fascinated by the scars there. Some are rippled and bumpy, others flat. But the most important thing is his wounds are healing. \"I'm glad you came to visit me.\" I say. \"I'll be here every other weekend.\" He says. He is flat on his back looking up at me, his hair messy and in his eyes. I lean over, bracing my elbows on either side of his head. \"I like you from this angle,\" he tells me. I roll my eyes. \"How long are you staying?\" I ask him. \"How long do you want me?\" he grins crookedly at me. For some reason this question throws me in a weird space. I am very close to telling him that I want him forever. The words are right on my lips, but I pause. The word forever is a serious commitment. It alludes to love. I stare down at the man who my life has been revolving around for months now. If someone had told me that Fourth of July in the Casino that by Christmas time I'd be straddling that surly fighter in my front hall, I would have laughed in their face. Yet, here we are. \"What are you thinking about?\" he asks me. He is becoming rather adept at recognizing my emotions. \"When we met.\" I answer. He chuckles. \"I was an asshole.\" \"So was I.\" I say. It seems like ages ago that I was hunting him down for a story. \"Makes sense that we're dating.\" He laughs and pulls me down to him. He wraps me in a toe curling kiss. His body is warm despite the temperature outside. I press into him, glad that for the first time since we've been together he is not wincing from any injuries. Tommy is well, and wholly mine. He pulls back all of the sudden. \"Are you cooking something?\" he sniffs the air experimentally. I move with the speed of the Looney Tunes Roadrunner. My pot pie is blessedly not burnt. I fish it out of the oven and set it on a cooling rack. Tommy comes up behind me. \"You cook, you've got a job and a house and you're gorgeous.\" He says. His arms encircle my waist. \"I think I'm going to have to hang on to you.\" He resumes kissing me. As we stand in my warm, delicious smelling kitchen kissing, I am overwhelmed by a desire to hang onto this feeling. I want this, this simple happiness where no one is talking about work or war or responsibility. There is only Tommy and his lips and the promise of a long night alone together. It's startling, realizing that I am falling for him and falling hard. This thought reverberates in my mind as he runs around my kitchen, determined to make dessert since I made dinner. He is standing at the counter, mixing instant cake batter, chattering happily about nothing in particular. I think I love him. It does not make sense. I should pick someone a little easier to be with, someone who can sleep through a night without waking up in terror. Someone who is family is not so dysfunctional. \"You're doing some deep thinking, babe.\" Tommy remarks. \"Want to share?\" Screw logic, I think. Plucking up my courage, I open my mouth. \"I love you.\"[Chapter 16] Author's Note: You guys are the best! Thank you for consistently reviewing! It is like all of the oxygen gets sucked out of the air. There is tremendous pressure in my chest, like my lungs are about to explode. The only sound for a moment is the whirring of the electric mixer. The moment I told Tommy that I loved him, his hand slipped, splashing chocolate batter across the counter. He scrambles to clean it up, pointedly avoiding my eyes. I do not know what I am expecting to happen, but this silence is deafening. I weigh my options, trying to come up with something to say. I could laugh, but that seems inappropriate. I could tell him I was just kidding, but that would be a bold-faced lie. Or I could repeat it. Neither seems the best choice. \"Tommy,\" the sound of my voice hits him like a whip. He jerks up, startled. \"I'm not expecting you to say it back.\" I tell him. \"I just wanted you to know.\" The silence continues, at least on his end. Tommy beats the mixer on the side of the glass bowl. My simple statement has completely shut him down. He looks as though I just hit him in the head with a blunt object. \"You love me?\" at first it comes out so quietly that I can't hear him. Then he repeats his question louder. \"Yes.\" I say simply. Tommy swallows thickly. For a moment he looks as though he is going to be sick. I am up on my feet, unsure of what I am actually going to do, but poised to move. Tommy raises his hands, gesturing that he is ok. His face is down, facing the counter. I'm not sure if he is having a fit or contemplating the fastest way to get out of my kitchen and back in his truck. I should not have said anything. Absurdly, the Frank Sinatra song \"Something Stupid\" pops into my head. I should have thought about that before I blurted out my silly admission. \"Tommy, I didn't mean to…upset you.\" I begin. \"We can pretend I never said it.\" His head swings up so fast it's a blur. \"Don't do that.\" He tells me. \"Don't backpedal like that.\" \"I don't know what I'm supposed to do. You're kind of scaring me.\" I admit. \"Sorry,\" he begins shaking his head back and forth, like there is water in his ears. \"I'm just not used to hearing that.\" He laughs. It is a kind of disjointed sound, almost maniacal. It seems that he can survive war and physical abuse, but my admission of love has completely unhinged him. He wipes his face and begins to move, full of nervous energy. I watch him, my every nerve on alert. \"No one's said that to me since my mom died.\" He says suddenly. I swallow hard. \"Well, I'm saying it.\" \"Yeah,\" he agrees. \"Yeah you are.\" There is a loud bang that makes me nearly jump out of my skin. By the time I realize it was Tommy vaulting over my wood counter, he is right in front of me. I gasp and stumble back. He catches me confidently, pulls me up to him and crushes his mouth against mine. The intensity of his actions robs me of breath. Dizzy, I feel myself beginning to collapse. Tommy lifts my legs out from under me and wraps them around his waist. His arms are bracing my back. One hand is cradling my head and the other is firmly locked on my behind. His tongue sweeps past my lips, all at once aggressive and gentle. I feel a moan escape me involuntarily. The sound seems to egg him on. He tips us both over, pressing my back into my modest dining table. His body comes to rest over mine. I am still woozy and I feel as though I am floating above somewhere, watching us. Tommy scoots us further up on the table. His hand acts as a pillow between my head and the hard grain of the wood beneath us. I am terrified that the table is going to give out. It is creaking and groaning under our combined weight, but somehow it holds. Tommy strokes me through my clothing, running his hands over every bit of skin he can. I am high on emotions—confusion, elation, desire. My body is humming, coming alive under his touch. I reach out for him and pull him down flush against me. I tangle my fingers in his unkempt hair, pepper kisses down the side of his face. He rocks his body against mine and I whimper against him. His hands are everywhere at once, my lips, my chest, my stomach, my waist. I fumble with the zipper of his jeans, trying to push the material down. We disengage for the briefest of moments, just long enough to shed crucial articles of clothing. Then he is on me again, skin on skin. Twenty minutes later I come screaming back down to Earth, completely limp against Tommy's torso. My whole body is tingling. Tommy is still panting somewhere to the side of me, physically spent. I still do not know what has just happened but I am incapable of complex thought right now. I slide limply off of the table, down to my hardwood floor. I lay my head against a chair, close my eyes and try to focus on breathing. \"You ok?\" Tommy asks. His voice is deep and hoarse. He slides down to sit next to me. Gently, he tugs my head against his shoulder. \"I'm…\" I search for words. \"I'm a little confused, honestly.\" Tommy chuckles quietly. He runs his thumb down the side of my face, coming to rest on my lips. He leans down and kisses me again. It is softer this time than the kisses a few minutes ago. \"Come on,\" he stands himself up and reaches down for me. \"Let's clean up a little.\" I attempt to grab a dish towel and wipe up the spilled cake but he directs me firmly to my bedroom. He deposits me on the bed, then marches into my bathroom and turns on the tub. \"Relax.\" He tells me and kisses my hairline. I pour myself into my bathtub and listen to the sounds of Tommy banging around in my kitchen. He has instructed me to not come out until he calls me. I do not have the strength to argue. I doze off a time or two in the hot water of my tub, depleted emotionally and physically. I still have no idea what the hell has just happened between us. I do not even have the strength to think about it. Instead, I climb out of the warm embrace of the water, dry myself off and throw on some comfy flannel pajamas. It occurs to me briefly that I have more flattering nighttime attire, but I honestly doubt this will matter to Tommy. I am braiding my hair back when I hear him calling me. \"Nicole?\" he peaks his head in. \"Hungry?\" He asks. \"Starving.\" I allow him to take me by the hand and escort me back into my kitchen. It is much cleaner than it was before I left, maybe even cleaner than it was before he arrived. I can smell the lavender scent of my dish soap, along with the aroma of reheated pot pie and the sticky sweet smell of sugar frosting. A lopsided, two-tier, chocolate cake is sitting on the now pristine counter. Tommy guides me to the gleaming dining room table, pulls out my chair and gestures for me to sit down. Silently, he doles out portions of food onto out plates. He seems in no hurry to break the quiet. I allow him a few bites of food. \"This is really good,\" he compliments me. I stare back at him. \"Tommy. We just had sex on my dining room table. I think we need to talk about this.\" He chokes. \"You said you love me,\" he says it as though this is some kind of explanation. \"I did.\" I confirm. \"And then you tackled me to a surface that used to only be for eating.\" He looks amused. \"What did you expect me to do?\" he asks. \"I don't know. Most people say something.\" \"I'm no good at saying something.\" He says. \"That's your strong point. My strong point is action.\" He's looking at me hard, like he is willing me to understand. \"So, me loving you, it's a good thing?\" I venture. \"Very.\" He spoons more pie into his mouth. \"And instead of telling me that, you chose to…express yourself on the table.\" I say. He looks pleased that I grasped the concept so quickly. \"It'll make a lot more entertaining story for my therapist tomorrow then just saying, 'my girlfriend told me she loved me and I think I love her too'.\" He says. My heart feels like it has stopped. \"Just to clarify,\" I ask, \"If I were to tell you 'I love you' in the future, you would…\" He smiles. \"Depends on what we're doing. If we're alone—\" he waggles his brows. \"I don't think my table can take much more.\" I say. \"You've got counters.\" He says this completely deadpan. \"I don't get you,\" I say. It's the honest truth, even if there's humor in it. \"You will. Hang in there long enough.\" He says. \"I guess I'll have to. Especially since I find myself in love with you.\" Tommy pauses eating to lean over and kiss me. \"Want cake?\" he asks. That is all the talking I am going to get out of him for now. I know a lost cause when I see one. I chose to eat cake instead. Despite being a tad bit structurally unsound, the dessert is pretty delicious. It is my turn to compliment him on his cooking skills and to delight when he turns bright red. We dump the dirty plates into my dishwasher and retire to my bedroom. We flip through the games for a while, sitting in quiet companionship. Tommy has me pulled flush to his side, as if any centimeter of space between us might be too much for him. I am leaning into his chest, listening to the sounds of the television and the beating of his heart. I am half asleep, exhausted from the day. Vaguely I hear the sound of Tommy turning off the television. He moves over and I flop onto the pillows, too tired to move. The lights in my room flicker off and I feel Tommy pulling my comforter back. He slides us both under the warm blankets and drags me back into him. I snuggle into his side, grateful for his warmth and the fact that he's by my side. There is no chance of having to rush around in the morning and get ready for the real world. His family will not be coming over and necessitating that he leave. I do not have to interview him. It is simply us, together in bed, sleeping. \"Good night,\" I whisper to him. \"Night, Nicole.\" Tommy exhales into my hair. \"I love you.\" I fall asleep with a huge grin on my face.[Chapter 17] The first nightmare I witness comes late Saturday night. Tommy thrashing next to me in bed wakes me up. It takes a moment to process what is happening; I am pulled suddenly from sleep by a flurry of motion. I blink, trying to adjust my eyes to the darkness, still wondering what is happening. I reach out to find that Tommy is covered in sweat, his skin burning. I am immediately alert. His muscles are twitching under my hand, his legs whipping around like he's running. The covers are bunched around his waist, twisted in a knotted mess. I reach down to untangle him and he catches my hand hard. I try to pull back to no avail. \"Tommy,\" I stroke his hair with my free hand. When it does nothing to rouse him, I try again. \"Baby!\" His eyes pop open. I am shocked by the panicked look on his face. His breathing is labored and he is still trembling. He desperately tries to place his surroundings. \"It's ok,\" I soothe, \"you're ok.\" He leans back and exhales hard. \"Shit,\" he breathes, letting go of me. \"Did I hurt you?\" he sits up to look at me. \"No,\" I assure him. \"I'm fine. I'm fine.\" He looks unconvinced. I punctuate my statement by crawling into the cage of his arms. We sit in silence, broken up only by the sound of Tommy's deep breathing. \"I thought that maybe, after therapy today, that I wouldn't…\" he sighs. \"It's going to take a while.\" I whisper into his sleep warmed skin. Tommy says nothing, just presses his face into my hair and inhales deeply. His breathing becomes more regulated. It is like he is melting into me, hot wax dripping down a candle. I gently press into him, lowering us back into the pillows. I sprawl out across his chest, just holding him. He is gripping me like I am a lifeline. \"Sorry I woke you up,\" he mumbles, falling back into sleep. I kiss him at the temple. \"Go back to sleep,\" I tell him. He eventually drifts off, but I lay awake, keeping guard like a golden retriever, chasing away the bad dreams before they can get to him. He has no more fits on my watch. I begin to fall asleep as the light begins streaming through the cracks in my drapes. I vaguely reflect that my brother will arrive within an hour or so. I tell myself I will sleep for a moment or two, then get up and get ready. When I wake up, the sun is high in the sky and half of my bed is empty, only an imprint betraying that I shared it at all. I sit up blearily, wondering what is going on. I glance at my bedside clock. In an instance I am panicked, leaping from my bed like a ninja, shoving my legs into clean pants and trying to coax my hair back into a ponytail. I grab the first shirt I come in contact with, a worn cotton one that belongs to Tommy. It practically drowns me, but I take comfort in the smell, like Old Spice and the mint gum he always chews and something that is uniquely him. \"Tommy?\" I call. My brother was supposed to have arrived an hour ago. I want to prepare him for the possibility of meeting my family. I follow the smell of coffee to my kitchen where Tommy is making eggs and toast. \"Morning,\" he greets in a deep voice. I walk over and he pulls me into him and kisses me. I realize it is his way of thanking me for last night. \"My brother should be here soon.\" I say. \"Let's not mention that you spent the night.\" \"So I just came over for breakfast at 7 in the morning on a Sunday?\" Tommy looks skeptical. \"He's not going to buy that.\" \"Maybe not.\" I acknowledge. \"But that's what we're going to tell him.\" Tommy just laughs and shakes his head. \"All right.\" He says. He is just beginning to spoon eggs onto one of my dinner plates when the doorbell rings. Before I can so much as move, Tommy is up and down the hall. \"Wait.\" I tell him. \"I can-.\" \"I've got it,\" he says. The look on my brother's face when Tommy swings my front door open is priceless. If the situation was not so dire, I might be tempted to run for my camera to capture the rare look of surprise on Mike's face. His wife, Angela, is behind him, fussing with my nephew Luke. They are all dressed as if they've been traveling, which of course, they have. Taking the red eye from Los Angeles has ensured that their little band has ended up on my front stoop early in the morning and in a terrible mood. \"Who are you?\" Mike dispenses with the pleasantries and cuts to the point. \"Tommy Conlon,\" Tommy extends his hand nonchalantly. Mike does not take it. \"And you're at my sister's house because…?\" Mike arches a curt eyebrow. It is like high school all over again when my first boyfriend dared to meet my brothers. \"Mike…\" I warn, trying to shove Tommy out of the way and face my brother head on. Tommy doesn't budge. He is not one to be intimidated. I can tell by the stubborn tilt of his stance and the slight smirk playing on his lips that he is fired up for a fight. Trouble is, my family is just as notoriously stubborn as he is. \"What do you think?\" Tommy asks his own question in return. \"I've got no damn clue.\" Mike says. \"But you've got no business being here this early in the morning. This is a family thing.\" I suspect that Mike is running on very little sleep and very high stress. He is always been overprotective, but I am not some kid anymore. He knows I date, and occasionally even take a man home. But something about Tommy has got his hackles up. \"I'm her boyfriend.\" Tommy says at length. \"Mike,\" I begin, but my oldest brother holds his hand up for silence. \"He's that fighter guy.\" Mike says, staring hard. \"You did a story on him.\" \"Exactly,\" I am praying that now that my brother has realized who Tommy is, he will calm down. \"So now you're sleeping with him?\" Mike hisses in a low whisper. It seems at last that Angela and Luke have realized that I am not the one who answered the door. Angela stares at Tommy in confusion but Luke immediately registers recognition. \"Holy shit!\" Luke points openly, his mouth dangling uselessly. Mike spins on him and smacks him lightly in the back of the head. \"What'd I say about cussing, damn it?\" Mike chastises. \"Real nice, Mike.\" Angela moves between them. \"Angela, let's not start this again.\" \"It's Tommy Conlon!\" Luke announces to no one in particular. Tommy graces him with a lopsided grin. \"What's up kid?\" he extends his hand. Luke grasps it excitedly. \"Why are you here?\" \"Doesn't matter. Your aunt's already got company and you're not staying with some stranger.\" Mike interjects. Angela, Luke and I protest all at once. \"It's not a stranger.\" Angela insists. \"It's your sister. You wanted to go on this vacation. Let's go!\" I am beginning to suspect that Angela might be the reason for my brother's foul mood. That and the fact that Luke is hyper and all wired up like a toddler. If what I witnessed in the past five minutes is any indication of what goes on at their home, Angela is fighting my brother on discipline tooth and nail. Behind her, the driver of their cab honks, impatient. My brother and his wife do not notice. The honking continues, more frantically. Luke is begging to stay at the top of his lungs, Angela is raising her voice to be heard over her son, Mike is gesturing frenziedly, Tommy is watching in amusement and I am wondering what in the hell I have gotten myself into. \"Tommy,\" I tap his arm to instigate him to move over. Instead, he takes it as a sign to go out to the cab and grab the luggage out of the back. \"Hold on a minute!\" Mike yells. \"Mike. He's my boyfriend.\" I yank him by the shoulder. \"Nicole, I didn't know you had company. I'm not going to leave Luke with some stranger.\" Of all the times for my brother to get overprotective this is most inopportune. \"He's not a stranger.\" I emphasize. \"Luke is perfectly safe here. Tommy's going back home at the end of the day anyway. He won't be spending the night.\" Mike's face still looks unsure. \"I don't want Luke exposed to any…hanky panky.\" I resist the urge to burst out laughing. \"He's been more interested in…\" Mike hesitates, \"adult relations lately.\" Angela, finally, comes to her husband's aid. It seems that now that Mike has raised this point, she has concerns too. \"We don't want to fuel the fire.\" She explains. It takes all of my self control to not smile. \"You think I'd just sleep with Tommy with my nephew in the house?\" Mike has the good grace to look ashamed. \"No, I guess not.\" \"Go on your vacation.\" I say. \"Enjoy yourself. I'll see you both next weekend. There won't be any,\" I finger quote, \" 'hanky panky' in here.\" We all turn to watch Tommy and Luke. My nephew is leaping around Tommy's ankles like a drunken puppy, all energy and nerves. He reaches out tentatively to take a swing. Tommy feints left, swipes his hand away and flips the preteen boy upside down. Luke begins laughing and squirming. Tommy deposits him down and shows him a defensive stance. They continue shadow boxing in my driveway. \"He's a fighter?\" Mike asks. \"MMA,\" I confirm. \"A good guy?\" \"The best.\" I say. \"We're going to miss our next flight,\" Angela reminds him gently. \"Go,\" I reiterate. \"We'll be fine.\" \"Nicole,\" Mike pulls me to the side while his wife is busy with his son. \"Luke is a handful.\" He tells me. When I raise an eyebrow, he amends his statement. \"He's a little shit.\" He says. \"I can handle him.\" I say. \"But you shouldn't have to.\" His frustration is beginning to show. \"It should be me and his mom. And maybe, if we spend some time as a family, Angela will back off a little bit. He's going to be a monster if we don't do something soon.\" I feel a stab of pity for my brother. He is so obviously distressed that I forgive his earlier transgressions. \"You and Angela need to figure that out between you two. Take this week to do it. Luke will be fine. And maybe,\" I glance at my yard where Tommy is showing Luke a hold, \"maybe Luke being with another man for a week isn't so bad. You know teens never listen to something their parents say. Remember us?\" Mike watches the scene unfold on the front lawn. \"Maybe you're right.\" He sighs. \"Sorry about—.\" I wave it off. \"Tommy is stubborn. You're stubborn. You'll both get over it.\" In fact, Tommy is seemingly over it by the time he approaches my front door. He chats amicably with my brother and his wife about their vacation plans. Mike warms to him, if just a fraction. By the time they are back in the cab and driving down the road, I am relieved. Luke sprints into my house without pausing to grab his bags. I make a motion to take them, but Tommy reaches out and stills me. \"Don't.\" He instructs. He follows Luke into the house. We find him standing by my kitchen counter, eating the eggs and toast Tommy made. \"What are you doing?\" Tommy barks out. The noise is so sudden that I jump. Luke mirrors my motions. \"I'm hungry.\" He explains with a full mouth. \"You left your bag on the porch. You're going to go get it. Then you're going to clean up your mess and come back in here and help your aunt make more eggs.\" His tone leaves no room for argument. He sounds like a drill sergeant. Luke regards him for a long time. I brace myself for some preteen sarcasm. \"All right,\" he agrees. He sets the plate down and walks out of the room. A moment later he returns with his bag. He sets it down on the floor. Tommy looks at him and arches an eyebrow. Luke picks his bag up again. \"Aunt Nicole, where do you want me to put this?\" he asks. Tommy and I hide our laughter as I show my nephew where he'll be staying. We spend the next few hours in typical lazy Sunday mode. Luke is on his best behavior in Tommy's presence. They spend a few amicable hours playing video games and watching television. Tommy talks about fighting and Luke is a captive audience. It is comfortable, domestic. They go out in my frosted over yard to spar and return filthy and pink-cheeked but happy. \"Are you going to fight again?\" Luke asks him over dinner. My head snaps up. I am interested in this answer as well. \"Yeah. On New Year's.\" Tommy says. He meets my eyes over the table. \"Can I come?\" Luke asks. \"If you're good, maybe you can sit with your aunt and my brother's family.\" Tommy wipes his mouth. \"Brendan Conlon?\" Luke practically swoons. Tommy just shakes his head, amusement playing faintly on his lips. He heads out to his new truck late Sunday night. I want him to stay and he wants to stay, but other responsibilities demand that we part. \"Your nephew ain't that bad,\" he tells me. Luke is on the couch asleep in a food coma. \"He's got nothing on Brendan and me when we were that age.\" I just shake my head. \"Thanks for helping with him.\" He shrugs. \"No problem. Between your family and mine, our kids are going to have some crazy relatives.\" He makes this comment flippantly, as though we have been together for ages, as though he expects us to make it in the long run. I find myself grinning hugely at him. \"Drive safe.\" I say. Tommy has already changed the subject and I know better than to press it. He nods. \"See you soon.\" He kisses me brusquely in my front driveway. \"Love you.\" He hops in his truck and drives off, leaving me standing in my freezing cold front yard, warm inside from my head to my toes.[Chapter 18] It is hard to watch Tommy fight. It is different now that I am no longer an uninvolved third party; every blow an opponent deals him sends my stomach reeling, but Tommy seems unfazed. He attacks with the ferocity that has become his calling card. Still, guys do not go down as easily as they used to. His foes have his number now and they're at least making it a challenge for him. Tommy says he likes it that way. I personally prefer the old method of him knocking men out in one or two blows. Tess sympathizes. She is as much of a staple at Tommy's fights as I am. She and Brendan leave the girls at home with Paddy and they join me. My relationship with the Conlons is now public knowledge. I have not exactly been hiding the fact that we are friends and Tommy leaning out of the cage to kiss me after a big fight two months back was a dead giveaway. Twitter exploded for an hour and then it blew over. Aside from one or two female fanatics, no one seems to care who Tommy is sleeping with. A particularly hard blow snaps Tommy's neck around and sprays blood across the mat. I am up on my feet, shouting angrily, torn between doing something absurd like climbing in the cage and bursting into tears. Tess is digging her fingernails into my arm, nearly as terrified as I am. Brendan is swearing indiscriminately. The only one who keeps their cool is Tommy. He recovers like it did not happen, and in one, two, three, four punches and a well-placed kick, his contester goes down hard. Tess and Brendan are cheering and jumping, but I am already ringside, reaching for Tommy. He grabs my hand in his sweat and blood-slicked fist and lifts me in with him. Even though he is bleeding, his eye is blacked and I think he might have chipped a tooth, he looks elated. We gather around him in the locker room as a trainer mops him up. He finally smiles, away from cameras and spectators. Brendan laughs at the brand new gap between Tommy's front teeth. \"They weren't crooked enough for you already?\" he asks with a chuckle. \"Figured it'd be easier than braces,\" Tommy grins, his teeth still stained red. Tess and I simply shake our heads. \"So what's the next big move?\" Brendan sits himself next to his little brother. They have an easy kind of relationship now, especially when their father is not around. I do not think it is any fault of Paddy's, but old hurts run deep and something about his presence sets both men on eggshells. Alone, you might never know they were ever estranged. They tease and laugh and I get a glimpse of what life might have been like between them before Tommy left. \"Sparta,\" Tommy answers, wiping his face with a wet towel. He dabs around the new stitches on his eyebrow gingerly. The white fabric comes away stained red. I try not to notice. \"Once wasn't enough?\" Brendan snags the towel out of his brother's hands and wipes away some blood behind one of Tommy's ears. \"Figured it'd be good to have two Conlons win in a row.\" Tommy shrugs. \"Besides,\" he continues. \"I owe you 2 and a half million dollars. I don't like being in debt.\" Brendan looks taken aback until Tommy begins laughing at his brother's expression. For his sarcasm, Tommy receives a rolled up wet towel to the face. They are punching each other in the arms and rolling on the bench like Tommy did not just get out of the ring a few minutes before. I am touched by the brotherly moment, but irritated that neither seems to remember that Tommy just got stitches. Sure enough, he tears two out, necessitating that the trainer be called back in. To hide my frustration, I call up my dentist and schedule the appointment I know Tommy will never make if I don't do it for him. Once Tommy has been stitched and cleaned up, our little gang heads out to dinner. Tommy takes the time to call his Pop. The conversation seems a bit strained, but it is polite enough. I hear Tommy mumble the words \"you too, Pop\" and I know that Paddy has just told his son that he loved him. Tommy's emotional silence in the car ride confirms it. I reach over for his hand as we drive. I glimpse Tess noticing the gesture from the back seat. She smiles a private little grin for me in the rearview mirror as I navigate the streets of LA to my parent's favorite restaurant. It will be the first time our families meet. Brendan and Tess jumped eagerly at the chance to come to California. I privately suspect that it has less to do with the prospect of meeting my parents and brothers and more that it's not snowing in Los Angeles. Still though, they seem more excited about it than Tommy. I'm hoping he's just nervous. He reverts to the stony stoicism that earned him his reputation. He only smiles again when we enter the restaurant and Luke begins waving at him excitedly. \"Conlon!\" he grins like a fool, \"good fight!\" When he spots Brendan his excitement escalates. It takes several moments to calm him down enough to make introductions. My parents, Dwayne and Linda are all smiles, though I notice my mom glancing at Tommy's bruised face worriedly. She's a registered nurse and a textbook worrier. I give her a look that I hope encourages her to wait until after dinner to pull my boyfriend aside and start talking about preventing infection in facial wounds. My brother Mike greets Tommy with a mild sense of familiarity and his wife, Angela hugs him like an old friend. My other brothers, Steve and Mark, stay cool, though I know the both of them are MMA fans. Sure enough, when Tommy and Brendan turn around, they begin talking to each other in hushed, hurried tones. They will be asking for pictures by dessert. My brothers look like variations of one another. Mark, the youngest, is tallest by an inch or two but they are all over six feet tall, built like runners with black hair worn short. I catch a table of women shooting Mark and Steve interested looks that my brothers reciprocate. \"What?\" Steve asks. \"You're not the only one who can get some action around here.\" He gestures to Tommy. \"Looks like you beat the crap out of him,\" Mark observes. \"It takes all the fun out of being a big brother if your little sister beats up her own boyfriend before you get a chance.\" I shove him with a laugh and he wraps me in a headlock. The hostess casts us a worried look as she leads us to a private room in the back. My mom turns around and pins us both with her best \"knock it the hell off\" look. Even after all this time, it is still incredibly effective. Mark and I jump apart while Steve and Mike just laugh. Tommy gives us a weird look I cannot read. For some reason, it worries me. We are seated in the back, away from prying eyes. My family falls into chairs in an established pattern. On one side it's Mark and I, the babies of the family, on the other it's Mike and Steve. Spaces are made for Tommy and Angela to squeeze in. Brendan and Tess fall on Mike's side and my parents squeeze together at one head of the table while Luke takes the other, conveniently placing himself with a Conlon brother on either side of him. We banter back and forth about what to order, agreeing to fork over portions to one another so we can all get something different. My dad reflects that it would have been better to go to a restaurant that serves family sized portions. My mother counters that it would have been too easy to just do that and besides, it is a family tradition to share food. Steve bullies me into ordering chicken parmesan over lasagna so he can have a bite. Conversation is carried mostly by my clan, though Tess is contributing and Brendan is certainly making an effort. Tommy is sitting there with an expression that suggests nausea. I draw his attention to me subtly. \"You ok, baby?\" I whisper as our food is brought out. \"Yeah,\" he mumbles. \"Just dizzy is all.\" I know he is lying, but I do not push it. My dad tries to stimulate some conversation from him, but is rewarded with curt, one or two word answers. I feel my temper flare and even Brendan shoots his brother a warning look. The only one Tommy is cordial with is Luke. My nephew is happily spurting fighting stats and training tips, begging both Conlon brothers for their opinions and tips. He has came leaps and bounds from a few months ago. Mike called a week after Christmas to let me know that he and Angela had reached some agreement. Luke has joined his school's wrestling team and with it, has found a discipline he previously was lacking. Besides his comments to Luke, Tommy is focused almost entirely on his dinner. I wonder silently whether or not he is just shy. He has never been this overtly rude with anyone. While my family debates tiramisu over cheesecake, the Conlon's and I take a moment to address the problem with Tommy. He and Brendan have some sort of silent conversation. Brendan excuses them both, and with a smile he drags his little brother off. Tess shoots me a worried look and then shrugs. \"Brendan will sort him out.\" She says quietly. She jumps into the great dessert debate, throwing her support behind tiramisu. \"What's wrong with your man?\" Mike leans over to whisper to me. I have to admit I do not know. Steve leans forward to join the conversation. He is in grad school, studying psychology. \"He didn't have the best childhood. Maybe he's uncomfortable seeing how close we all are.\" Steve says simply. The minute the words leave his mouth, I know it must be true. I debate going to find Tommy but a moment later he and Brendan rejoin us. \"We have to get ice cream if we get cake,\" he says casually as he falls in the chair next to me. My whole family tactfully hides their shock. \"The man knows how to order dessert,\" my mom praises. Steve shoots me a knowing look when Tommy is not watching. I'll need to talk to Tommy later but whatever Brendan said outside must have done the trick for now. We make it all the way to dessert and the parking lot without a hitch. Tommy doesn't apologize, but my family lets it slide. He smiles lopsidedly at them as we pile back into our cars to follow my parent's home. They insisted that while we were in town we stay with them. On the drive back I say nothing, choosing not to push the issue in front of an audience. It isn't until we have been given a tour of the house (it has not changed much since my youth) and my parents and Brendan and Tess excuse themselves for bed that I breach the subject. \"So what was the issue at dinner?\" we are outside in my parents' backyard, enjoying a warm breeze. Tommy cracks his neck and stares at me for a moment. I do not back down. After several minutes of silence, he gives in. \"I just got nervous.\" He tells me. \"And?\" I know that was not the only issue. \"And…I'm not used to family stuff like that.\" He admits. \"So why didn't you just tell me that?\" I ask. Tommy shoots me a look. \"Right…\" I say. \"You're still not the best at talking.\" Tommy nods in agreement. He begins to pick at his stitches and I yank his hand down and hold it in my own. \"Brendan pointed out that I looked like an asshole.\" He continues. \"I'm sorry. I didn't think about it. I just did what I always do when I'm nervous.\" \"The strong, silent, broody thing.\" I say. He laughs a little. \"Are you ok now?\" I ask. He shrugs, focusing on our hands. \"I don't know. Your family is just really different from mine. Your house, your brothers…your parents.\" He has gotten to the root of the problem. \"I'm sorry it upsets you.\" I say. I honestly am sorry that my family points out the glaring issues his own has. \"Your mom reminds me of my ma.\" He says. \"I guess it just makes me….\" Neither of us finishes his sentence. The tears running silently down his cheek are words enough. He curses softly as the saltwater reaches his wounds. I brush the moisture away gently and crawl into his lap. We sit silently in a deck chair, listening to the breeze. \"I'll do better tomorrow,\" he promises me. I kiss him and offer up a small smile. \"Next time you're uncomfortable, just tell me ok?\" He laughs bitterly, \"I'll be telling you a lot then.\" He brushes a stray strand of hair out of my face. \"I'll be ok. It gets better every day.\" I nod. It has gotten better. His nightmares are becoming fewer and far between. He smiles more readily now (unless he's in the ring) and he's more eager to spend time with his family. The last few months have been baby steps, but they are all in the right direction. \"Come on,\" I pat his knee. \"I need to show you where you're sleeping.\" He raises an eyebrow. \"I'm not with you?\" \"My parents are old fashioned.\" I explain. Tommy looks thoughtful. \"Then we need to go to the car for a minute.\" When I look confused, he continues. \"I've got some things in mind for us to do before we're banished to our separate rooms.\" \"Maybe tomorrow,\" I tell him, laughing. \"I don't want you to rip your stitches.\" He gets a look like a petulant child. \"Besides, tomorrow we can go to the beach. I know some secluded spots.\" He goes willingly to bed after that, grinning his brand new, gap-toothed smile. I retire to my childhood bedroom, glad for the familiarity of home and for a moment away from Tommy. I love him, but sometimes it is exhausting keeping up with his mood swings. I hope we have nipped his funk, but time will tell. It's going to be a long weekend if he is in a bad mood the entire time. I am scared of what my parents think of him now. Their approval, even in my adulthood, is important to me. Hopefully, Tommy didn't blow it with them.[Chapter 19] Author's Note: Thanks for all the positive feedback! Here's another chapter! I come down the stairs in the morning to find Tommy laughing happily at the dining table with my parents. He looks a mess—the bruises from yesterday have turned a sickly kind of yellow, his stitches cut a jagged path through his eyebrow and when he laughs, he looks like a hillbilly. Still, he is putting in the effort he promised me last night. He has clearly just come from running. His shirt is sweated through and he's in a pair of sweat pants I'd rather he left at home. But whatever he is saying to my parents has them all in peals of laughter. \"Morning, babe,\" he greets me. As I sit down, he slides a mug of tea at me. \"Good morning,\" I smile at my parents, silently questioning what they're talking about. \"Tommy here was just telling us about how you first met.\" My dad says. \"Yes, it seems you stalked him for an interview?\" my mother smiles. \"More or less.\" I admit. \"He was playing hard to get.\" Tommy's grin widens. \"Had to make you work for it, babe.\" My parents continue to laugh at this. Tommy excuses himself to take a shower. I am left alone with my mom and dad. I brace myself. \"So,\" my dad begins, pouring me a bowl of Frosted Flakes like he did when I was little, \"he seems nice.\" \"The majority of the time, yes.\" I affirm. \"Only the majority?\" my mother is alarmed. \"He's not angry or abusive or anything, but he has PTSD. It manifests itself at inconvenient times.\" I say. There has never been any point in lying with my parents. They normally know things before I tell them anyway. My father proves this with his next statement. \"Dinner?\" my dad asks. I nod and briefly explain the situation. They know the outline of what Tommy's life has been to this point from television. \"Have you talked to Steve about it?\" my mom asks. \"Once or twice over the phone.\" After Tommy suffered a series of terrifying nightmares a month or so back, I panicked and called my brother. He talked me down over the phone, explaining that even with therapy, these things were normal and the only thing I could do was be there for him. I echo his advice to my parents now. My dad nods sagely. \"That's quite a project you've taken on, hon.\" \"If you don't mind us asking, how did you get involved?\" my mom asks. I explain the story from the beginning, tactfully leaving out our first time together in Arlington. My parents listen, interjecting here and there for clarification. \"You always did like to help,\" my dad chuckles quietly. \"You know that you can't fix anyone, sweetheart?\" my mom asks, not unkindly. \"He's in therapy.\" I say pointblank. \"And fighting is constructive for him.\" \"It's going to take years. And even then, there are going to be hard times.\" My dad warns. \"Everyone goes through hard times,\" I say. My mom cocks an eyebrow in agreement. \"Our situation is…unique.\" I search for the right word. \"But we love each other.\" \"Well,\" my mom smiles, \"that's what really counts then.\" I notice that they still look worried as they leave the kitchen table. I want to ask them why, but Tommy finishes his shower and reemerges. \"Want to go to the beach?\" he asks. An hour later finds us at El Matador Beach. It's a secluded spot, possibly the only one left in the LA area. It's a rocky beach and a bit lonely, with none of the glitz and glam of Santa Monica or Venice. It suits our purpose perfectly. Brendan and Tess opted for a day in Hollywood, leaving Tommy and I alone. We pick through rocks until we get to the sandy stretch that marks the beachfront. Tommy immediately wants to plunge in. I warn him that the water will be cold, but he shakes me off and dives in headfirst. A moment later he resurfaces, yelping. I smile and shake my head and stubbornly refuse to pull a beach towel out for him to run into. \"You need to learn a lesson.\" I tell him. \"And what is that?\" he asks, shaking water out of his ears. His whole body is prickling with chill. \"Listen to me,\" I say. He just laughs and shakes out his wet hair. \"Shit,\" he curses, \"that salt water stings.\" I roll my eyes and start off down the beach. He follows. The sun is blessedly out, and he dries off quickly. He reaches for my hand as we traipse through the sand. He's quiet, as usual, but it is a comfortable silence. I enjoy our time alone together, reflecting that we haven't had time like this in a while. Tommy seemingly reads my thoughts. \"When's the last time it was just you and me?\" he asks. \"A few weeks now.\" I say. Work has been hectic, for both of us. And now, with him training for Sparta, it will likely be months before we have any significant time alone. \"We gotta work on that.\" He says. I do not respond. \"What's wrong?\" I cannot put my finger on it. It is a combination of things, stress from work, stress from Tommy, the thought that there is a lot more stress in our foreseeable future. Suddenly, I am tearing up right then and there. I suppose it is my turn to be an emotional basket case. Tommy pulls me under his arm tightly and steers me into a cluster of huge boulders. They form a cavern of sorts, allowing a view of the water but providing shelter from the sun and onlookers. \"Nicole,\" he begins, pulling my face up to his, \"what's the problem?\" \"I don't know,\" I sob. I feel like an idiot. \"You still mad at me for last night?\" he asks. I shrug. \"You're upset about not seeing each other?\" he tries again. This time I give a tiny nod. Tommy reaches for my bag, pulls my giant beach towel out and spreads it over the sand. He drags us both down onto it. I try to pull myself together. Tommy wraps me in the cage of his arms, pulling me hard to his bare chest. It is still cool and salt slicked from his dive into the ocean. \"We're going to be ok, you know?\" he whispers in my ear. It is less of a question and more of a statement. The moment the words pass his lips, I realize that is what I've been worried about. \"Sometimes it's hard.\" I confess. \"I'm hard headed,\" he says casually. \"And you're just as stubborn. But the good thing is, most of the time, only one of us is being super emotional.\" To illustrate his point, he brushes the tears off of my face. \"You've got today. I've scheduled my breakdown for next Wednesday. Just a head's up.\" He says. I wipe my face. \"You really think we're going to make it?\" I ask. He fixes me with a hard stare. \"We better. I've made plans and I don't feel like changing them.\" It's not the most romantic of sentiments, but it peaks my interest. \"Plans for what?\" I ask. \"Hang in there and find out.\" He says. He winds his fingers into the thick ropes of my hair, massaging my scalp. The motion is relaxing and I sigh, feeling the stress ebb out of me. \"I love you,\" I say quietly. \"Even when I'm being a dick?\" he asks. \"Maybe a little less then, but yes.\" I say. He smiles. \"I love you too.\" \"Even when I cry for no reason?\" \"You never cry for no reason.\" He says. He leans forward and gently kisses me. \"Then what do I cry about?\" \"Normally, you cry for me.\" He says simply. \"It's nice to have someone who cares enough to cry for you.\" I stare at him and he meets my gaze. It is his way of thanking me, I realize, for putting up with his mood swings and issues. \"There's far more good in you than bad.\" I say. I need him to know this. He looks skeptical but says, \"The longer I'm with you, the more good there seems to be.\" I smile at him, feeling my heart swell. We are on an emotional rollercoaster, but there is no one I'd rather ride it with. I tell him so. Tommy grins at my change in mood and flops backward onto the towel, dragging me down with him. It is still early in the day so the sun isn't high in the sky yet. It is almost chilly under the shade of the boulders, but Tommy keeps me pressed closely to his side. I absentmindedly trace the scars and tattoos on his skin, drifting in and out of sleep and listening to the sounds of the ocean. It is still technically winter here so we are alone on the beach. Seagulls wheel overhead almost lazily. It is calm, quiet and comfortable. It is not long before Tommy leans over and begins brushing kisses across my lips. I reciprocate eagerly, enjoying the languorous motions he makes against me. It has been months, I feel, since we just kissed. Usually, it is followed in a hurry with sex, the length of our separations making us desperate for one another. But now it is just the two of us, with no schedule to rush off to. We take our time with one another, exploring like it is new, like we have never been together before. His hands map out the curves of my body—the arch of my back, the swell of my hips, the planes of my stomach. His lips barely skim my skin, leaving a cool sensation that tingles all the way to my core. He drops a kiss right below my belly button, tickling me. I succumb to giggles. He continues to assault my sides and my laughter escalates. I manage to wrap my legs around his waist and use him as leverage to roll the two of us over so that I am straddling him. He could easily flip us back, but he rests his hands on my hips and smirks up at me expectantly. I lean over, creating a curtain of hair that shields both of our faces. I make as though to kiss him, but turn my head at the last moment. He groans in disappointment, but then makes sounds of encouragement as I move to nibble his ear lobe. I take my time, kissing every scar, every mark on his body. There are a lot of them, but I commit to my task. From neck to waist, I kiss the pain away until I reach the hem of his trunks. They are still damp from his earlier dip. \"Nicole,\" his voice is strained. \"You're killing me here.\" \"What do you mean?\" I feign innocence. When he lifts an eyebrow, I sit up and casually rock my hips into his. He strains up towards me. \"Babe…\" he warns. He can only take so much of my teasing. But after last night, he owes me one. I place a hand on his chest and press down, cautioning him to be still. He settles down but looks at me hard. I can tell he is out of his comfort zone. Good. I fiddle with the laces of his swim suit, toying with the fabric but not untying it. Tommy grips my waist tighter and pulls me forward into him a bit. His whole body is tight and hard as a bow, every muscle on alert. I run my fingers under his waistband then halt. Tommy sighs in frustration. \"Tell me what you want.\" I instruct. He looks at me like I've lost my mind. I don't relent. \"You,\" he says plainly. His right hand moves to the back of my neck and he jerks my head down, melding his lips to mine in a searing kiss. By the time he allows me to pull back, I am trembling all over. I have lost all dexterity; I fumble with the laces of his shorts before his calloused hands join mine, making short work of the knot. It briefly crosses my mind that we are in public and if someone was to walk by, they would be treated to a whole lot more of us then I might want them to see. The thought flees as my shirt gets tugged over my head. My skin prickles in the shade, but Tommy runs his hands over my skin, undoing my bikini top. I had put a lot of care into choosing it this morning, settling on a black suit with gold trim. It does not seem to matter now. The fabric gets tossed somewhere to the side of us. \"I want you,\" he repeats, sitting up and pressing his face into my chest. I have lost the ability to make any sounds that aren't plaintive moans of pleasure. He lavishes attention on me until I feel like a puddle of nerves. Our chests are pressed flush against one another as we move. It is a slow pace, almost lazy. The sound of the ocean keeps tempo until Tommy seems to lose control. The rough fabric of the towel is suddenly pressed into my back and I am treated to the sight of the blue of the sky before it is replaced with Tommy's face. We come to a roaring crescendo, collapsing on each other in the sand. \"This'll be a good story for the therapist on Monday,\" Tommy says into my shoulder a few minutes later. I shake with laughter. \"Maybe let's keep this one to ourselves. Deal?\" I ask. \"Deal.\" He kisses me again. We are both tan and beaming when we return in the late evening. We stop by Hollywood to pick up Brendan and Tess. As they hop into the car, Brendan takes a long look at the two of us. \"Have fun?\" he asks, his tone making it clear that he knows exactly how much fan we had. Tommy just smacks him in the back of the head. As we drive down the road, he smiles conspiratorially at me. I just wink.[Chapter 20] Author's Note: Thanks for all the positive feedback and reviews! You guys are great! If you haven't reviewed yet, please drop a line and let me know what you think. Thank you! It is finally warm enough in Philadelphia to go outside and Tommy is taking full advantage. He, Brendan and Paddy are in an open field near the train tracks, running around and working out using tires big enough to lie comfortably in. Normally, I try to stay away from training sessions; it is Tommy's domain and with Sparta coming up, he needs to focus. But today is a special occasion. Tommy is turning 30. I promised not to make a big deal of it. He insists he doesn't want a fuss. I was all for the quiet dinner until Brendan let it slip that Tommy hasn't had a birthday party since he turned 10. 20 years is far too long to go without having someone celebrate your birth. So I have resolved to make an attempt to give my man a happy birthday. It has been difficult trying to balance my desires with Tommy's. If it were up to me, he'd come home to a house packed full with friends and family screaming \"surprise!\" at the top of their lungs. There would be cake and presents and music and more food than is necessary. But these things are not Tommy. So I found an alternative. I watch Tommy and his brother dive in and out of the middle of the tires, flipping the rubber over with grunts and groans. I am reminded vaguely of Rocky and the training montage. They are both covered in grease, sweat and dirt. Paddy stands nearby and shouts orders at the two of them. It is the closest that the three of them will get to male bonding. It is the only time I have seen them all cooperate without an awkward moment or a fight. Paddy barks orders at his boys and they jump, pushing their muscles to the limit. Even though Brendan is not fighting anymore he seems to take great pleasure in training with his little brother. I know Tommy likes it too, though he will not outwardly show it. He and his brother work on Tommy's technique, trying to up his game and give him an unexpected edge. I glance at my watch. If they do not wrap up soon, we will be cutting it close. \"Bored, babe?\" The men take a water break. I quickly try to cover. \"You could at least be shirtless,\" I tease. Tommy smirks. Brendan shakes his head. \"My God, you two are like rabbits.\" He says. Paddy grumbles. \"You're going to have to put a lid on that before Sparta. Can't have you worn out.\" I cannot decide if this is a joke or an actual command but Brendan smoothes the situation over by laughing uproariously. Tommy looks slightly irritated, but Brendan ribs him, drawing a smile. \"It's about time to get back,\" Brendan looks at his phone. \"The girls are waiting.\" \"One more round?\" Tommy is already moving off back towards the tires. Brendan moves to follow him, but I reach out and grab his ankle. He turns in surprise, mouth open to protest. I quickly shake my head, trying to convey what I need with my eyes. \"Tommy's birthday.\" I mouth at him. He does not seem to understand. Paddy's gruff voice surprises me. \"Let's wrap it up. This old man's tired.\" I am profoundly grateful. I catch Paddy's eye and he winks at me. I am not the only one who wants to do something nice for Tommy. \"You got something special planned?\" he whispers as we walk back to the car. \"Manny's family is coming,\" I say. Paddy's eyes widen. \"Pilar and the kids?\" \"They should be here in a little bit. I have to pick them up.\" Paddy nods, lost in thought. \"You go do that then. I'll clean the boys up and make sure they end up in the right place.\" \"What place?\" I was planning on just going to a restaurant. \"Mine.\" He says. His eyes focus on Brendan and Tommy who are wrestling each other to the asphalt in the parking lot. \"Think you can get a cake?\" he asks. \"And ice cream.\" I say. \"We'll be over there by 7:30.\" I smile at my conspirator. \"Been a while since we had a party…feels about time to change that.\" Paddy says, though he does not seem to be talking to me anymore. \"You guys coming?\" Brendan calls to us. He is got Tommy in a headlock. \"If you promise not to strangle my boyfriend!\" I shout back. Tommy redoubles his efforts to break free. Brendan doesn't relent. \"You better come save him then.\" Brendan challenges. \"Brendan, let the boy see his 30th birthday,\" Paddy does not raise his voice but his sons still snap apart and come to attention. \"Sorry Pop,\" Tommy says. But the moment his father slides into the car, he punches Brendan as hard as he can in the arm. \"You're coming back to hang out?\" Tommy asks as I get into my own car. \"I promise.\" He yanks me to him, getting sweat all over me. I squirm away, swatting at him playfully. \"Go shower!\" \"All right, all right…\" he brushes a kiss over my forehead. I watch them drive off before getting in my own car and haul to the airport. I make it just as my phone begins to ring. \"I'm here,\" I maneuver my car into the merry-go-round that is airport traffic. I am suddenly nervous. I have never met Pilar or her children face-to-face. The handful of phone conversations we have had have been pleasant. But still, she is a part of Tommy's life that I am unfamiliar with, a throwback to the days before we met. I have never seen them together. I do not know what to expect. I hope that Tommy will be pleased, but he might be saddened by their presence, by the memory of a friend that was taken from him. I spot the little family standing on the corner with their bags. Pilar is looking around expectantly. I honk my horn, making her jump. She waves, visibly relieved. It takes longer than I would have thought to get the two booster seats into the back of my car. Her children are adorable—the oldest is a precocious 6 year old girl named Nina. Her mother has her hair plaited into two long black braids down her back. She smiles at me in that shy way that children do, politely offering up her little hand to shake mine. Her little brother, a two year old, is named Manny after his father. He is a chubby cheeked little cherub with dark eyes. He regards me coolly, as though he's not sure what to make of me. \"Tommy doesn't know we are here?\" Pilar asks me as we navigate our way back into traffic. \"I want to surprise him.\" I smile at her. She just nods. From the corner of my eye, I can see Pilar studying me. Her stare unnerves me. I so desperately want to impress her, this lady who Tommy speaks so highly of, almost as though she is family. I need her to like me, to give me her stamp of approval. I feel as though this is crucial. I am being weighed and measured. I hope I am not found lacking. \"How long have you two been together?\" she asks conversationally. \"We met last June. But we've been together since he came back, so over 6 months now.\" As I say this out loud, the significance of the thing hits me. Tommy and I are in that space where, at our age, you commit or cut your losses. \"He's never dated anyone that long before.\" Pilar says. \"Really?\" I wonder where she is going with this. \"Or so Manny told me,\" she says. I can think of nothing to say to this. I just nod. The silence resumes. \"He speaks very highly of you, you know?\" she asks a moment later. \"He doesn't do that with anyone else. I've barely heard him talk about his family.\" \"So what does he talk about?\" I ask in my journalist tone. \"He asks about us, mostly. You'd think after 2 and half million dollars he wouldn't feel the need to check on us anymore, but he does. He promised Manny, you know?\" she turns around to correct the behavior of her children, who are kicking one another in the back seat. Something about the reverence in her voice sets me on edge. She is fond of Tommy, that much is obvious. Hollywood plotlines of the grieving widow falling for her husband's best friend swarm my head. For half a moment, I regret bringing her here. I chance a glance at Pilar. She is smiling softly at her children. She is a pretty woman. Her dark hair is sleek and shiny, pulled half up and half down, highlighting nice cheek bones and full lips. She is dressed not like a millionaire, but still quite nice. It is clear she takes pride in her appearance but there is certain sadness in her eyes that she cannot hide. It would be incredibly difficult, being in her situation. Tommy is her biggest shoulder to lean on, a connection to her husband. They are friends united in grief, I tell myself. It is a powerful connection, but Tommy is in love with me, not her. I repeat this to myself as we stop at the grocery store to buy ice cream. We let the kids select their favorite flavors, making small talk about the weather, the economy, anything but the past. \"The kids are excited to see their Tio Tommy,\" she tells me as we head to checkout. \"He'll be glad to see them too.\" I say. \"He's always talking about them.\" \"I always thought Tommy would have little ones by now,\" Pilar muses. She glances at me quickly, then back down at our cart. \"Do you want kids?\" Manny Jr. swings around her calf, begging for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. \"One day.\" I say. She just nods. My feelings of unease continue. We continue on to Paddy's house. Pilar is holding the ice cream and I have the cake. I notice that Brendan's family and Tommy already seem to be here. I pause, trying to figure out the best way to get into the house. We could barge straight in, shouting surprise, or maybe just come in the backdoor and sneak up on Tommy. I'm deciding that that is the best plan when the front door comes bursting open. \"Pilar?\" Tommy's hair is still damp from his recent shower, but that does not stop him from plunging outside, practically running at us. The ice cream is suddenly thrust into my arms and on top of the cake and Pilar rushes to meet Tommy. He catches her in a hug, swinging her off of her feet. The kids take off after her, tackling him at the knees. They look like one big, happy family. I force myself to smile. \"What are you guys doing here?\" he asks, smiling so brightly that his face looks likely to split down the middle. \"For your birthday,\" Pilar tells him. I notice she doesn't mention who invited her here. \"Happy Birthday, Tio Tommy,\" Nina says in her quiet voice. Tommy swoops her up, settling her on his hip like an old pro. He begins talking to her in that tone adults use when interacting with kids. She giggles excitedly back. I stand on the outskirts, wanting to move in but having no idea how to tactfully do so. Tess appears in the doorway, looking questioningly outside. Her girls huddle behind her, inspecting their potential playmates. \"Need help?\" Tess calls out to me. She's like a savior. \"Sure,\" I say, a little too happily. I rush to the front door, eager to put distance between myself and the scene behind me. I should be happy, I tell myself as introductions are made. My birthday gift is a hit. Everyone is stationed in the living room, chatting loudly, asking questions. I am seated on the arm of the couch, balancing precariously. Pilar is next to Tommy, beaming. Manny is on his lap, Nina on hers. Brendan is asking about their trip, asking about their house in Texas. I smile at it all, my lips frozen. The only one who seems to notice this is Tess. She makes pointed eye contact with me. \"Want to get the cake ready?\" she asks. I nod and walk off to the kitchen to join her. The door swings shut behind us. She glances back at it, as if she can still see her family through the wood. \"Are you ok?\" she asks. We make no motion to get the desserts out. I swallow. It would be easier to lie and say that I'm just tired. I feel sick with jealously and uncertainty. I know nothing about that woman in the living room, that connection to Tommy's past that I have no link to. I'm used to being his support group, his number one girl, the only woman he's affectionate with. It's a selfish impulse, but I can't shake it. \"I think I'm jealous,\" I blurt out. To her credit, Tess doesn't judge. Instead she smiles, shrugs and looks back at the door. \"If someone was sitting that closely to Brendan, I'd be jealous too.\" She confides. \"We'll watch her.\" She tells me. I feel grateful for an ally. \"Thanks,\" I say. \"You'd do the same for me.\" She moved to the freezer. \"Now paste that smile back on. We've got cake to serve.\" We reemerge, my smile a trifle less forced. Pilar is still too close to Tommy for comfort, but I resolve not to let it bother me. I push down the feeling of butterflies and open my mouth to sign the birthday song.[Chapter 21] Author's Note: I'm on an updating role. Thanks for all the positive feedback and reviews! You guys are great! If you haven't reviewed yet, please drop a line and let me know what you think. Thank you! \"You ok, babe?\" Tommy leans over to me. His voice startles me awake. I have been drifting in and out of sleep. We are in Paddy's miniscule backyard, stationed in uncomfortable plastic lawn chairs. The air still has that chilly bite characteristic of the months before summer really gets into swing. I am huddled under a thin blanket, my legs pulled up under me. My feet fell asleep ten minutes ago, but I am too cold to move them. It is a testament to how much cake and ice cream I ate that my food coma is able to overcome such discomfort. Brendan and Tess took the girls home two hours ago, but Pilar, Tommy and I have been talking. Or rather, they have been talking and until recently, I was listening. \"Just tired,\" I smile at him. I hope that he will suggest that we head back to his place to go to sleep, or at least go upstairs to his childhood bedroom. \"You should go on inside,\" Pilar says. \"We'll be fine.\" She smiles innocently at me. Her legs are crossed and she looks perfectly composed, despite the hour. I take a long look at her, then the six pack of beer sitting between us and the expectant expression on Tommy's face. \"I'm ok.\" I say, sitting up and resolving to stay awake. I smooth my hair nervously, trying to coax it back into a presentable style. It is hard to feel sexy in a lawn chair, especially one in the slums of Pittsburgh. Pillar seems to be pulling it off though. If she is cold in her shorts, she does not show it. She leans forward, sipping her beer daintily, happy for a break from being a mom. Tommy is lounging in his nonchalant way, his muscular arms exposed in the tank top he is wearing. His hair has grown out; it is a tad bit shaggy on the top and in no particular style. It gives him a youthful look, a contrast to his tattoos and rippling biceps. They continue trading stories about the past, talking about Manny. The subject fascinates me. I listen, forming a more complete picture of who this man might have been in my mind. From Tommy's accounts, he was a prankster, the man who made everything more fun just by being there. Pilar paints a similar picture, but adds some intimacies, what kind of a father he was, how much he loved his children. I listen to how Tommy and Manny met in basic training, how they were tasked with sparring in front of their regiment. Tommy blacked Manny's eye and Manny split Tommy's lip and they became instant friends. Tommy was best man at Manny and Pilar's wedding, godfather to their son and practically family. I close my eyes again, content with just listening. I have no stories of my own to contribute anyway. The talk turns to inside jokes and I roll to my side, snuggling into the arm rest. Perhaps they assume that I have fallen asleep, because the conversation takes an intimate turn. \"I'm just so lonely sometimes,\" Pilar confesses, \"It's hard.\" \"Manny wouldn't want you to be alone.\" Tommy's voice has reverted to that tone he uses when something is bothering him. It's far away and distance. \"I'm a mother of two. It's not exactly easy to get back in the game,\" she chuckles wryly. \"Gorgeous as you are, it can't be that hard.\" I hear Tommy gulp his beer. I ignore the compliment; after all, Tommy has said much nicer things to me. \"Men who want to be fathers to someone else's kids are few and far between.\" She says. \"Maybe you need to just go out and get an itch scratched.\" Tommy says. \"Call a babysitter, put on some heels, get back out there.\" \"I wouldn't even know how to do that. Manny and I met in high school.\" \"The game hasn't changed so much since then. Hike your skirt up, see what happens.\" I cannot tell if Tommy is joking or not, but Pilar laughs. \"Is that how she got you?\" she asks. \"I think she had a skirt on, but she wasn't trying to seduce me.\" \"What was she trying to do?\" \"Interview me.\" He says. \"Ah, she's one of those.\" I am guessing Pilar doesn't watch ESPN. \"One of what? It's her job. I gave her shit but she didn't give up. It worked out.\" \"I didn't expect you to have a girl so soon.\" She says. I get the feeling that they are both looking at me. \"Oh yeah? Why?\" Tommy asks the question I want to blurt out. I focus on looking asleep. \"Well,\" I can hear her shifting around. \"Whenever you came around, it was always you and Manny. And if you did meet a girl, it never lasted more than a night.\" Tommy laughs. \"Give me some credit. A few of them made it through a whole weekend.\" My stomach clenches. \"Either way,\" I can almost see her rolling her eyes; her tone conveys her emotions so well. \"It surprises me that you're all committed now. And to someone so…different from your usual.\" \"You'd rather her be a bimbo?\" \"No. She just seems so classy.\" She is essentially implying that we are in different leagues. I feel my temper heat up, but to jump up and yell now would be highly inappropriate. For a long moment there is tense silence. I contemplate opening my eyes, but then I hear her speak again. \"She's good to you?\" \"The best.\" Tommy sounds completely confident. I am supremely grateful. \"She knows how much baggage you come with, right?\" \"What's that mean?\" he sounds defensive. \"Well, Manny used to be different when he came back. And he didn't have half the stuff you dealt with before you even went into the Marines. It's hard to watch someone you love go through all that…\" \"She knows.\" Tommy clips out. \"And she's ok with it?\" \"Obviously.\" \"I'm not trying to offend you,\" Pilar says. \"It's fine. I'm just wondering what you're asking.\" \"Tommy, you're so good with making sure the kids and I are taken care of. I'm just making sure someone's taking care of you.\" Her voice is soft, imploring. \"She takes care of me. Probably too well.\" Tommy says. \"Good. You deserve it.\" I know without seeing that Tommy is blushing. Any kind of compliment makes him uncomfortable. \"You need someone too. Someone who's closer than I am.\" \"Eh, one day, maybe. The hurt is too fresh.\" Pilar sounds so sad that I want to cry. I feel ashamed of my earlier jealousy. The silence resumes. I hear the two of them scooting around, clinking bottles. \"I better toss this. I don't want Pop to see.\" Tommy says. It signals the end of the conversation. \"I've got it.\" Pilar tells him. \"Put your woman to bed.\" \"Think it's too late for birthday sex?\" Tommy asks, nearly laughing. He has successfully turned the conversation away from the serious. I hear Pilar smack him on the arm. Tommy's laughter escalates. I consider it safe to open my eyes. I smile sleepily at them. \"Sorry; I guess it was just a long day.\" I say. Pilar yawns. \"I don't blame you. I think I'm going to head to bed,\" she looks at Tommy. \"First door on the right at the top of the stairs.\" He directs her to the guest room. I shake my head at his lack of home training. \"I'll take you.\" I offer. \"See you up there babe. Night, Pilar.\" Tommy sets about throwing away bottles. I lead her up the stairs. Now that the two of us are alone, I want to confront her about her opinions on me. I go through a few scenarios in my mind, trying to come up with a tactful way to broach the subject. \"So you and Tommy are close?\" I ask. \"Not until Manny died,\" she answers. \"He seems to take really good care of you. I'm glad you could come out for his birthday.\" Pilar nods. \"It is good to see him again. I missed him. So did the kids.\" She pushes the bedroom door open. Nina and Manny Jr. are already asleep in one of the twin beds in the guest room. Pilar looks warmly at them. \"They're beautiful.\" I compliment her. The sight of the two children snuggled in bed siphons the anger right out of me. She is a single mom in a shit situation. The last thing she needs is me picking a fight. I am reminded of the bursts of anger Tommy sometimes has, the things he can say when he is having an episode. Everyone needs someone to vent to. I'm Tommy's lifeline. Tommy is hers. \"They're just like their papa,\" she smoothes Manny's hair. \"It must be hard,\" I whisper. \"Even just dealing with Tommy sometimes…\" I trail off, searching for words. \"You're never the same after war.\" She says. \"Tommy, God when he came back without Manny,\" she begins to tear up. I am frozen, unsure what to do. \"He was so guilty, you know? I thought he was going to do something stupid, hurt himself…\" I swallow thickly. \"He loved your husband.\" \"I know.\" She sniffles. \"We have that in common.\" Silence hangs heavy in the air, suffocating us. \"He's getting better,\" I say. \"Every day, he improves.\" She nods. \"You're good for him.\" She sounds upset, almost jealous. \"I love him.\" It is a simplified explanation, but nevertheless, it is the point I want to make. I am staking my claim. Tommy, despite whatever his relationship is with Pilar, is mine. The point is nonnegotiable. She smiles weakly at me. \"Good night,\" It is as polite of a dismissal as she can muster. \"Good night.\" I say. If we knew one another better, I might hug her, offer some lukewarm words of comfort. As it stands though, we are nearly strangers. And I have a broken man of my own upstairs waiting for me. I trudge up the stairs, all the way to the attic room that once belonged to Tommy. I sit down on the narrow twin bed, so lost in thought that I don't hear Tommy's feet coming up the stairs. He vaults straight over my head, landing hard on the bed behind me. I jump, startled. \"Damn, you really are tired.\" Tommy's hands encircle my waist. \"I thought you were using that as an excuse.\" \"An excuse for what?\" I lay backwards across his torso. \"To listen in on our conversation.\" He smiles at me. \"You were pretty slick there, sweetheart, but I saw you.\" He echoes his words from our first meeting months ago. I do not even muster the strength to act ashamed. \"Sorry, I just thought it'd be awkward if I opened my eyes in the middle of all that.\" He shrugs, unconcerned. \"Besides, Pilar seemed like she had some things to talk about she didn't want me to hear. Did she notice I was awake?\" He shakes his head. \"She's too wrapped up with what's going on with her.\" \"I don't think she likes me.\" I venture. He shakes his head. \"Nah, she's like that with people she doesn't know well. The first time I went home with Manny, I thought she was a bitch.\" His straightforward manner relaxes me. He twirls my hair absentmindedly around his fingers. His casual affection comes more readily now, even in public. \"The kids are cute.\" I say, leaning into his touch. \"She says that they wake up sometimes, screaming for Manny.\" Tommy says. I know he knows the feeling; there have been a few occasions where he has done the same. \"That sucks.\" It is not the most eloquent of phrases, but still, it describes the situation perfectly. \"I hope she takes my advice.\" He shifts his hands around my waist, allowing him to lift me up like I weigh no more than a rag doll. He pulls me flush on top of him. \"It helps to have someone.\" \"I kind of get the feeling that she wants you,\" I do not mean to say it, but it slips out. Tommy leans backwards into the pillows. His blue grey eyes stare at me. I feel as though they are looking straight into my thoughts. \"Are you jealous?\" he asks, just the hint of amusement on his tongue. I feel my face flush. \"I know it's stupid, it's just—.\" \"She did try.\" He cuts me off. \"Just once. Right after I came back. I went to Texas before the Burgh, to check on her.\" \"What do you mean she tried?\" I know that anything before we met should not count, but I still feel overprotective. Tommy sucks in his bottom lip. \"I got there. She was crying on me. I was hugging her and…she tried.\" He leaves it at that. \"What did you say?\" I ask quietly. \"I said I couldn't. And I didn't.\" he clarifies. I digest this quietly. I can't believe how upset I am over this. After all, I did bring her out here. \"She hasn't tried since.\" He assures me. \"Not that it would matter if she did.\" His fingers walk a path down my back until they reach the back pocket of my jeans. He flattens his palms and pushes them in, cupping me in his grip. \"I'm sorry,\" I begin. I hate being jealous. I feel especially ashamed that I let it mar enjoying his birthday party.\" \"For what?\" he sounds confused. \"That was the best birthday I've had since I was a kid. I got to see my good friend and her kids and now I've got you up here in bed in a room with a door that locks.\" He smacks my bottom for good measure. \"It's not your birthday yet,\" we both glance at the clock. In 3 minutes, his twenties will be behind him. \"Are you ready for the next decade of your life?\" \"It's got to be better than the last ten years.\" He says. \"Especially if it starts off with you naked.\" I shake with laughter. \"You've got a one track mind.\" He smirks. \"I tried all of my teenage years to get a girl up here in this bed,\" he tells me. \"Now I'm living the dream.\" \"In this bed?\" I glance at the scant inches of space around us. \"You barely fit.\" \"Gives me an excuse to hold you closer.\" It is sappy, even if he says it with a laugh. \"Are you trying to butter me up?\" I ask. He begins to massage me. \"I've got about a minute and a half to get your engine going.\" He glances at the clock. \"That's some speedy foreplay.\" I start to sit up. \"We had three minutes.\" He chastises. \"You're the one who wanted to waste it talking.\" I detangle myself from him and stand up. Piece by piece, I shed my clothing until I am standing there in my second birthday present to him. It is entirely black and red lace, with all the pushups and accoutrement that Victoria's Secret is known for. I had nearly forgotten about it in my haste to fall asleep, but I am not tired now. Tommy seems to be wide awake as well. His pupils dilate and his eyes darken. \"You've got about thirty seconds to get it off.\" I tell him. My skin feels warm under his heated stare. He stands up so quickly I can barely see him. His shirt hits the ground in record time. \"Hell no,\" he pulls me into him, \"leave it on.\" He picks me up and wraps my legs around my waist. I hear the clock beep quietly as midnight rings in. \"Happy 30th Birthday, Tommy,\" I whisper against him as he slides home.[Chapter 22] Author's Note: An update! Special thanks to my new beta reader, Tullulah Lulah, who has been a tremendous help with editing this last chapter. And thanks to all of you out there who review and message and keep me motivated. You're all so lovely. Let me know what you think about this installment! I can't recount a time I have ever been so frightened. Tess and I are huddled up in her living room, barefoot on her hardwood floors and still dressed in our bathing suits. She is standing flush to my side, her skin cool from swimming. My hair is in damp and unruly curls. We are both shivering in the air conditioning. However, the tremble that rips through Tess's body has nothing to do with the temperature. There is a crash from the kitchen, the unmistakable sound of glass shattering on the floor. I jump and Tess reaches for me. Her hand clasps mine and I am thankful for the pressure. Her grip seems to be anchoring us both to reality. Tears sting my brown eyes and I snap them shut, forcing them down. I swallow the knot in my throat as Tess and I stand hand in hand, listening. Brendan raises his voice. Tommy's joins the chorus. They are yelling at one another, swearing, uttering terrible curses. They throw accusations like daggers. Each one seems to stick into the other and come through the door, stinging Tess and I. It is the old hurt all over again, the abandonment, the guilt, the anger. I don't know if the brothers have ever truly laid all of their problems out like this, but they are certainly doing it now. Tommy hurls an insult, accusing his brother of always putting his own needs first. Brendan explodes, yelling back that Tommy is selfish. That he's alone because he wants to be, that he pushes everyone away, that he can't accept help. To my side Tess gives a strangled sob. Her fist is shoved in her mouth, her blue eyes squeezed closed. She looks incredibly small, like the weight of what is going on in the kitchen is crushing her. I look down at my own arms and am surprised to see that they are shaking and that the copper colored skin there is pimpled in goose bumps. \"Should we go in?\" she whispers. I am too terrified to answer. Part of me wants to rush in, get between them and tell them to stop it. The other part knows that they need this. I have seen the tense silences that punctuate their conversations get more frequent. I have seen Tommy wake from nightmares, felt his sweat-slicked skin, the erratic beat of his heart, heard him calling out for his mother, for Brendan, for anyone to save him. What has happened between them is complicated and requires attention. It is not enough for them to gloss over the issues, to refuse to talk about the past. I know that Brendan has tried, but Tommy always pushes him away. It appears he pushed too far today. \"She was my mom as much as she was yours. I loved her just as much as you did.\" Brendan sounds on the verge of tears. This time Tess doesn't even try to disguise her sob. \"Then how come I was the only one there watching her die?\" Tommy is obviously crying, though his voice is full of venom. \"You made that choice. Just like you chose to leave.\" \"You chose to stay. For a girl.\" Tess shakes with more fervor. \"For my wife! I am not going to apologize for it anymore, Tommy.\" \"Then why are we having this conversation?\" \"Because you never apologized! You're not the only one who got hurt. I was there? Remember? I was there when Pop was roaring drunk. I was the one holding your hand while you cried. I was the one who stopped him when he was trying to hit you. I was the one he ignored, even when you were gone. We both saw mom's bruises. And you didn't call, you didn't even…\" Brendan's voice breaks off and he succumbs to tears. The silence stretches for what feels like an eternity. There is so much sniffling that I can't tell who it is coming from, or even from what room. We hear the sound of footsteps coming towards the kitchen door and break apart. My hand tingles from the imprint of her tight grip. The door swings open, allowing me a momentary view of Brendan, bent over the kitchen island, his head in his hands, and shards of glass underneath his booted feet. Tommy stomps out, red eyed and angry. He passes the two of us without as much as a sidelong glance. Tess and I exchange brief eye contact before she rushes for her husband and I rush after Tommy. It takes three of my steps to match every one of his long lunges as he heads with single minded purpose for the door. I barely have time to snatch my bag off of the couch before he is barreling outside. Barefooted, I follow him, calling his name in a voice so full of desperation I barely register that it's mine. He is in his truck, punching his keys into the ignition. I hardly manage to hop into the passenger seat before we tear out of the driveway. I am startled to see that he is crying openly, the tears rushing from his sapphire-grey eyes and down his cheeks. If it impedes his ability to drive he doesn't show it. He steers us up and down the main roads without aim, driving and crying. I search for words but come up blank. I want to hold him, rub his head and ask him what just happened. He is lost, deep in some past nightmare. \"Tommy,\" I say quietly. My voice seems to hit him like a whip across his face. He glances my way briefly before returning his gaze to the street. The sun is dipping behind the skyline. We drive in silence, my sense of unease escalating as the odometer clicks up. The Delaware River comes into sight. I study the grey water, watching the ripples play off the light of the sunset. It is a beautiful evening. The sun stains the world a faint pink, casting the world in a soft glow that seems to be mocking me. This is supposed to be a vacation, a time to relax before the Sparta tournament next weekend. Tess called it family bonding, insisted that I be there. The first day was enjoyable, a barbeque in the backyard, the sounds of Tommy laughing and the girls playing. It was the calm before the storm. Something terrible happened when the brothers left the house to train this morning, some private pain must have been rehashed. Paddy did not return with them, the first warning sign. Then Brendan all but rushed his daughters from the house, insisting they play with the neighbors. Tess and I didn't even have time to change from our pool trip before we heard the first shouted words in the kitchen. Tommy turns his truck into a driveway of a park. He navigates through the greenery, intent on finding something I am not privy to. I am mesmerized by the simple beauty of our surroundings, the old trees, their branches splaying towards the sky, the empty fields of endless green, the Delaware, cobalt blue in the background. It is empty here, serene. I begin to understand why Tommy retreated to this space. He backs into a parking space, the bed of his truck facing the shores of the river. Without a word he gets out of the driver's side and heads for the back. I follow, watching my step, cursing my decision to forgo shoes. He allows me to spread my still-damp beach towel over the bed of the truck before he climbs in. I watch him watching the sunset, his sadness so evident on his face that I can't even begin to contemplate what brought it on. He is going to have to talk to me, really talk. It's a terrifying thought. I allow him a few more minutes of silence before I try to start conversation. \"What's wrong?\" It is the only opening I can come up with. He shakes his head once and then twice, as though my question is unanswerable. \"Tommy, please talk to me. I want to help,\" I say. \"You always want to help, Nicole. I don't think you can help with this.\" \"You can at least tell me.\" I scoot closer to him. He leans backwards, lying down on the towel. I look down at him. \"Been 14 years, today,\" he says so quietly I almost don't hear it. I search my mind, wondering what he could possibly mean. It hits me all at once. \"Since your mom died?\" I ask. \"Yeah,\" he swallows thickly. Understanding comes. I search for something to say, but to my surprise, Tommy starts talking on his own. \"She was really sick. Pop took it all out of her. And then, leaving Brendan… I don't know. She wasn't the same. We weren't the same.\" His body deflates like a popping balloon. \"She tried to hide it at first. But it was pretty damn obvious once she started coughing blood. She got so weak she couldn't get up in the morning, so I stayed home, dropped out of school. She used to make me pray with her, pray for Pop, for Brendan, for myself. She had this bottle of holy water,\" he wipes his face. I dare not interrupt. He has never told me any of this before. \"I used to rub it on her like it was medicine. I don't know how she got through the winter in that piece of shit shack we lived in. I kept thinking I should call Brendan. She would cry out for him at night when she thought I couldn't hear. But I was afraid.\" He sounds disgusted with himself. \"I was afraid Pop would come too. I was afraid what calling him would mean.\" \"What would it mean?\" I ask quietly. \"That she was dying. That it was the end of the line. Then where would I go? Back?\" He shakes his head feverishly, \"Nah, I couldn't go back. I was too angry, too scared. So I didn't call. And she died anyway.\" He sounds like a child, like he's moments away from collapsing on himself. \"Did you ever tell him?\" I ask. I reach down for his soft brunette hair and twist my fingers in his silky locks. \"No.\" He has the grace to sound guilty. \"I ran. I left as soon as she was in the ground.\" He pauses, perhaps thinking about that day. I picture him, young, unlined, his innocence shattered, standing alone by his mother's coffin. The image is enough to make me cry. I bite back my tears though, determined to be strong for Tommy when he needs it. \"Pop hired a private investigator,\" he continues. \"I guess that's when he found out. But I think Brendan went looking for her right out of college. I don't know what he found.\" \"Did he confront you about it?\" I ask. \"Just once. Last year. But he hasn't brought it up since. It was me, who said something today. Don't know why.\" He brings a broad, calloused hand up to massage his temples. \"You feel guilty.\" It's not a question. Tommy shrugs, but I know it's true. \"Tommy, you've got to let it go.\" He lies there silently so I continue. \"You have to apologize. And you have to forgive them.\" It is something he struggles with. Tommy is full of anger and resentment stemming from his past. He will never heal if he can't move past it. \"Forgiveness is for Brendan and Pop. Everything has already happened,\" he says. The bitterness of the sentiment does not quite reach his tone. \"So why are you letting it effect what hasn't happened yet?\" I ask. He turns to face me for the first time since the fight, \"It ain't that easy.\" \"I never said it would be.\" Tommy contemplates this. \"Brendan loves you, Tommy. And he is sorry.\" \"I know all that,\" he says, sounding petulant. \"You love him too. And I know you are sorry. So why can't you just tell him?\" \"What good does sorry do? Doesn't change nothing.\" \"Yes it does,\" I am not backing down. The sun is almost completely beyond the water, bathing us in darkness. The last halo of light reflects off of the water and into the back of the truck, illuminating the tan skin on Tommy's face. I study the way the light plays off of his features, highlighting the tear tracks on his skin. \"I was alone,\" he says. It almost sounds like an accusation, a justification. We have come to the crux of the problem. Tommy felt abandoned, so much that even now, he cannot move past it. \"You were,\" I agree, \"and no one, especially not you, deserves that.\" My statement seems to validate his anger. I continue speaking before he can interrupt. \"But all you went through led you here. It made you the man you are.\" \"What kind of a man am I?\" His voice wrought with disgust. \"I'm as angry as Pop used to be.\" \"You are like your dad in a lot of ways,\" I admit, \"But the differences are more important.\" I lie down next to him and turn his face towards mine. \"You are always good to me, good to your nieces. You put other people before yourself.\" He shakes his head again. \"Not today. Not when mom died.\" Tears begin to gather behind his eyes. \"You can't change that,\" I reiterate. \"But you can change now.\" \"You think I should apologize,\" he sighs heavily. \"Only if you mean it.\" I want the decision to stem from him. It is completely dark now. My skin, still exposed in my swim suit and sarong, is prickling from the cold. Tommy, at last, notices my attire, \"Where are your shoes?\" \"In your brother's living room. Along with my clothes.\" He inspects me, faint amusement playing on his lips. \"You ran out after me without real clothes on. You think I was going to do something stupid?\" \"I just didn't want you to be alone,\" I say. Tommy sits up and removes his gray cotton t shirt. He gestures for me to sit up as well. I do, and he pulls the soft worn fabric over my head. The warmth is an immediate relief. Now in only his undershirt, he cradles me against his chest and lays us back down. The hard surface of the truck bed presses up into my side, but I lie still, waiting for my boyfriend to come to a decision. \"Am I being an asshole?\" he asks. I can barely discern his features in the twilight. \"I think it would be an easy thing to make it better.\" It is as diplomatic of an answer as I can give. \"Nothing is ever easy. 'Specially not in my family,\" he grunts. Before I can respond he swings his body up and stalks off into the darkness. I don't move to follow him. I am barefoot and exhausted, and it is getting too dark out. He has to return to his truck eventually. I sit up, adjusting the baggy t-shirt, and lean back into the rear window. One by one, the park lights come on, flickering and illuminating small patches of greenery. I catch sight of some statues in the distance and wish for a moment that I could take a walk and explore my surroundings. A light sputters on directly over the truck. I groan, shading my eyes from the sudden onslaught of brightness. When my vision clears, I glance over to see a pair of college-aged kids stationed around a car. Making eye contact is an instant mistake; one of the young men points excitedly at me, recognition written all over his face. There is nowhere to run, so despite the fact that I am barefoot, half dressed and in a bad mood, I muster a smile and try to simply turn away. I have no such luck. In a second, they are on me. \"Nicole Ryan?\" A dark skinned boy with low cut hair approaches. He's holding the hand of a pretty Puerto Rican looking girl. She's staring at me, assessing whether or not I'm a threat. I apparently pass the test because she relaxes, a slight smile on her lips. In my irritated state I contemplate removing the unsightly shirt, but it really is chilly and I have no desire to be gawked at. I exchange the necessary small talk. They ask for a picture and I consider declining, but they are all looking at me with such adoration that I would feel bad. I finger comb my curly hair, straighten my shirt and reluctantly lower my bare feet to the pavement. I'm stationed in the middle of a group of young men (the girlfriend is holding the camera phone) when Tommy stomps back towards us out of the night. If I excited the group, Tommy causes them to nearly swoon. I don't think the camera has time to save the picture when they rush off, running at the MMA god who everyone is so sure is going to take Sparta. Tommy is too far off for me to read his mood, and for a moment, I am panicked that he's going to go off on the group of kids. But as he enters the light, I see that crooked smile of his. \"You kids watch MMA?\" he asks them, slapping hands and bumping fists. They respond with youthful enthusiasm, recounting moments they've watched him fight, asking what it feels like to knock a man out. I climb back into the truck bed, forgotten, watching my boyfriend act as though nothing is wrong. He is tough Tommy Conlon, locked down and emotionless. He is as difficult to read as he was a year ago sitting in that locker room. The thought worries me. More pictures are taken, manly handshakes are exchanged, and even the previously uninterested girlfriend looks thrilled to be meeting him. They walk away after what seems like eons, leaving the pair of us alone. \"Ready?\" Tommy asks me as the college kids retreat to their car. \"For what?\" I am almost afraid of the answer. \"To go home,\" he says, helping me down and carrying me to the passenger seat. \"To Brendan's?\" \"You need your stuff.\" He walks around to the driver's seat. \"Are you going to talk to him?\" I buckle my seatbelt. Tommy just looks at me, refusing to say another word as we drive back.[Chapter 23] Author's Note: Special thanks to my new beta reader, Tullulah Lulah, who has been a tremendous help. And thank you to those of you out there who review and message and keep me motivated. Please let me know what you think about this installment! Atlantic City is largely unchanged from last year, with the exception that Sparta has somehow gotten even bigger. There is scarcely room to navigate the crowded boardwalk. I have never observed the words \"Tap Out\" scrawled in so many font and colors, have never watched so many people from so many walks of life gathered together. The world of MMA and UFC is like an exclusive club, a cult to rival football or a baseball. There are the big men, the ones you might expect to see, heavily muscled and in various states of undress, all either holding hands with bikini clad women or hitting on them. There are the college kids, skinny and eager and wide eyed, the tourists with their cameras, wondering what is going on, and families with children who wear the faces of their favorite fighters on their shirts. America's first boardwalk is colorful to the point of absurdity. There are the normal advertisements, the vendors, the casinos and hotels. With the addition of the fans, many wearing hats to rival things seen in a Dr. Seuss book, the whole area has a zealous sort of appeal, like Carnival in Brazil. It is nice to see it all as a tourist instead of hurrying to and fro, camera in tow. Tommy clutches my hand in his own, all but dragging me down the wooden walkways. He has the adverse effect of clearing a path. Crowds swarm to him like moths to a flame, clamoring for autographs and photos. He is becoming increasingly bad tempered, which only serves to ignite the fires of his fans' passions. They love him like this: angry and borderline resentful. This is the Tommy who they flocked from all corners to see. He comes to a stop in front of the fountains at the Pier Shops at Caesars, realizing at last that we can go no farther. He gives me a look of frustration, but I only shrug. After all, no one is clamoring to see me . This is his time. With a sigh he straightens up, glances around and begrudgingly reaches for a sharpie marker held by the fan closest to him. I stand at his side, smiling while he broods, watching the amount of attention he commands. People ask him to pose and he reluctantly throws up a fist, glowering all the while. They eat it up and I bite back my laugh, occasionally stepping into the frame when someone recognizes me as well. It lasts for nearly 45 minutes, this nonstop barrage of well-wishers and trash talkers, of people telling Tommy they've got money riding on him or that they can't wait to see him knocked out. The only ones he has a smile for are the kids. They come up to him, some buzzing with excitement, others tentative, but he lifts them all up, balances them on his shoulders and grins for the photographs. This seems to take some people aback; some of the bigger guys whisper amongst themselves. Tommy takes no notice of them. He might as well be standing alone, for all the attention he pays other people. Whether they insult or compliment him, his reaction is the same. Indifference is a mask he wears well. A few of the other fighters mill in and out, joining in the fray. Rampage Jackson attracts nearly as much interest as Tommy. He's built like a human tank and could give my boyfriend lessons in scowling. Right now though, he is all laughs, exchanging good natured trash talk with a crowd. He is something of a movie star at the moment, thanks to a role playing the toughest member of the A Team. He spots us from afar and moves towards us. I think for a moment that the crowd is going to get its first peak of bonafide male head butting. Instead, Jackson extends a hand. \"Conlon, my man,\" he says with a serious look, \"thanks for what you and your boys did for us overseas.\" Tommy stares at him hard for a moment, with that locked down expression on his face. He nods, almost imperceptibly, and then grasps Jackson's hand. \"Saw your movie. You were a good Mr. T,\" the two men shake hands, acknowledging their mutual respect. \"Won't stop me from kicking your ass, Conlon,\" Jackson says, male bonding moment over. \"You can try,\" Tommy wipes his nose, completely unconcerned. The crowd hoots and hollers like a fight is about to start in the high school cafeteria. Tommy turns, gestures to me and walks off, done with it all. \"See you in round two,\" he yells over his shoulder. \"Bring your A game,\" is Jackson's parting shot. \"I pity the fool that don't,\" Tommy shoots back. The crowd roars its appreciation and even Jackson's lips twitch in a smile. The rest of the day passes in a similar manner, a blur of faces that look vaguely familiar and a sea of brand new ones. The big stars are all here, some to watch, some to fight. I spot people I have become familiar with; Stephan \"American Psycho\" Bonnar, Forrest Griffin, Ryan Bader and Matt Hamill round out the usual All-American suspects. A man swaggering by with the air of a fashion model catches my eye. I am startled to recognize him as Mauricio Rua, a Brazilian fighter and Jiu-Jitsu master who I've watched take guys apart in the past. I spot up-and-comers, Jon Jones and \"the Dragon\" Machida, men who are every bit the animal that Tommy is. Even though I was completely aware that Tommy might face these men in the ring, the sight of them in real life unnerves me. I wonder how they could possibly be considered lightweights. Most of them are over 6 feet tall, built like walls, with biceps of iron. Some of them, like Jon Jones, are much younger than Tommy. They walk around with their posses in tow, dressed to the nines, covered in more sponsor labels than Times Square. These men are professionals, guys whose back stories are peppered with knockouts and TKO's, with submissions and winning streaks. None of them had to interrupt training to defend their country. None of them have recently recovered from an explosion. The reality sets in. These men can hurt Tommy and they will be actively trying to do so in just a few short hours. He's the only fighter returning from last year. He might as well have bulls eye painted on the back of his head. If Tommy realizes this, he doesn't show it. He doesn't stop to talk to any of them. In fact, he barely glances their way. He's preoccupied with talking to the guys behind the scenes now. There are a few legends milling around and he seems to be trying to speak to them all. He is stationed next to Chuck Liddell and Eugene Jackson. I listen to them trading stories and jokes, wishing that Tommy would ask them for advice. They all seem so taken in by him, so eager to see how he will perform. Randy Couture stops Tommy in the lobby of the Harrah's to tell him he is a big fan. It marks the first time I have ever seen my boyfriend look a little star struck. He gapes a tad as Couture walks off, signing autographs as he moves toward the elevator. \"Better shut your mouth, babe. You're starting to drool,\" I tease. \"I used to watch that guy. He was an animal,\" he says. \"So are you,\" I tell him, \"So are a lot of guys in here.\" He glances at me, \"You worried?\" \"I would be lying if I said I wasn't.\" He shrugs. \"They're all just gonna hit the mat one at a time.\" He throws an arm confidently over my shoulder. \"C'mon,\" he says, \"let's go.\" We are about to move upstairs to the room when I see Brendan and Tess. They took a later flight than we did so that they could get their daughters situated. Brendan makes it about three yards into the lobby before he is recognized and surrounded. He looks incredibly overwhelmed by the attention. Tommy watches it all unfold. I glance between the two brothers, wondering if they ever truly made up. They shook hands upon our return to Brendan's house last week, but beyond that, I do not know what has passed between them. \"Maybe you should go save him,\" I suggest, gently squeezing Tommy's arm. He groans, but plunges in headlong anyway. I know Tommy feels bad for whatever it was that he said a few days back. Apologies are not his strong point. I have learned to look beyond what he says, to see the emotion in his actions. For the last few days he has been incredibly accommodating to my every whim. It is his calculated way of saying sorry. The crowd parts like the Red Sea as Tommy reaches Brendan. He leans forward, exchanging quiet words with his older brother as cameras flash around them. Brendan clasps his shoulder. The two pose for a few seconds before they shove through the crowd, Brendan holding Tess's hand, Tommy holding their luggage. We retreat to the solitude of our shared hotel rooms. Just like a year ago in Arlington, our rooms are joined by a door in the middle. Brendan and Tommy disappear into one room with Paddy to go over strategy for the weekend. Tess and I are left to ourselves. \"How was your trip?\" I ask. \"The girls were sad they couldn't come,\" she says, transferring clothes from her suitcase to the dresser. I notice some nice, but modest outfits. They are a far cry from what some of the other fighters' women will be wearing. Even I debated what to bring, finally settling on some tasteful but tight dresses. I won't be the most glamorous woman ringside, but I'll look presentable. \"It must be nice though, for you and Brendan to have some time together,\" I stand up to help her. She snorts. \"They're going to be doing whatever man ritual they need to before the fighting starts,\" she puts the last of her clothing away. \"Trust me on this; we're going to be pretty much alone this weekend.\" True to her word, the men do not emerge for upwards of an hour. We are left to our own devices. My mind is racing, painting scenarios in which Tommy succeeds this weekend. The thoughts of him losing are more vivid. I recall past fights of his that I've been to, the fear that stabs like a knife in my belly whenever someone lands a vicious blow. Tommy has won all of those fights, so I tolerated the black eyes and cracked teeth, the bruises and cuts, the soreness that can leave him almost immobile the next morning. There are times where he is so banged up that I am afraid to touch him, lest it inflict pain. What is he going to be like after this weekend? The question haunts me. \"Nicole,\" my boyfriend is in the doorway wearing a hoodie and fighting shorts. \"We're going to go down and spar for a little.\" Most of the fighters, I know, are getting ready to go out, to bask in the adoration of their groupies. Not my boyfriend. His work ethic both inspires pride in me and makes me resolve to take him out the moment this all is done. Tommy never has a chance to just be young. \"All right,\" I say. Tess voices a similar conformation. I see Paddy in the background, already moving to the elevator. He tips his head at us. We wave back. My eyes follow them out. Perhaps Tess detects some worry in them. \"This weekend will go faster than you think,\" she tells me. \"I hope so,\" I sigh. \"You just have to remember, when he looks over at you from the ring, you have to smile,\" she says sagely. \"Don't look scared. Yell when there's a bad call, cheer when he does something good. Just don't look scared,\" she repeats and pats my back. \"It's easy to fake it.\" Her statement and the suggestive way she says it, brings me to laughter. \"Do you fake it?\" I ask. \"Only ringside,\" she smiles. She has successfully distracted me for the time being. We playfully banter, trading funny stories about our men, our first time, all of those things women speak about when we are alone together. It is fun to compare the brothers, to converse about their similarities and differences. Tess has insight that comes only with time. She offers tips on how to handle the typical Conlon sullenness, tells stories about what Tommy was like when she first met her husband. I am fascinated by the thought of my boyfriend as a teenager. I have only even seen one picture of him when he was a child. Paddy showed it to me. He has a scrapbook of sorts of things about his boys. There are newspaper clippings, a short blurb on Brendan winning a teaching award and pages dedicated to his win at Sparta. Towards the beginning of the scrapbook, though, Tommy is dominant. From the time he was about five years old, Paddy seemed to be obsessed with his talent, shaping his son into a mean fighting machine. It's easy to see how Brendan could have been jealous. There is only one picture of him as a teenager, and Tommy is in it. The boys are squinting into the sun, with that look of adolescent disdain that high school students get when cameras come out. Tommy was all lean muscle and long limbs and he looked comically gangly. Brendan had a more filled out appearance, almost like the boys on a teen sitcom. When Tess first began to date her husband he was handsome, unlined, and athletic. There are shades of that man still, more so now than before his family reconciled. Nevertheless, it is sad to see what years of stress can do to youth. Part of me is jealous of Tess because she knew Tommy when he was still whole, still relatively innocent. It is a side I might never be familiar with. \"How do you stand it, watching Brendan fight?\" I ask her. She shrugs, studying her fingernails. \"I've been watching him fight since high school. One time,\" she begins, \"he got hit so hard that he was unconscious for hours. The girls and I were waiting in the lobby of the hospital and all I could think was that if anything happened to him…I wouldn't know what to do.\" She stops and smiles weakly at me. \"I guess it's silly, especially in this decade, to wrap your life around a man like that, but…\" \"I guess it can't hurt, if they feel the same about you,\" I tell her. \"Brendan adores you.\" She blushes, though the knowledge can't surprise her. After years of marriage, she is still that giggly adolescent girl, deep in her first teenage love affair. \"Tommy is crazy about you too,\" she says. \"You should see the way he is when you're in Bristol and he's with us. He barely sleeps, just paces the house, like a lion in a cage.\" This is a revelation to me. \"Really?\" She nods. \"He just works out and comes home and thinks about you.\" \"You don't know that he is thinking about me,\" I attempt to laugh it off. \"I think that you are one of the only things he thinks about,\" she says so simply that I know she believes it to be true. I let the weight of her statement sit between us. My entire relationship with Tommy, I have felt as though I am the one more in love, the one more willing to give. I know that he needs me, that he appreciates me even. I know that he is not lying when he says he loves me. I just do not know what love means to him, or what he plans on doing about it. The clamor of celebrations going on all around us reaches the window of our room. I look down on the crowded streets, watching as the sun sets over the boardwalk. People are already raging, yelling, indulging in all kinds of debauchery while Tess and I sit upstairs. I come to a decision. \"Want a drink?\" I ask. \"A drink?\" Tess begins laughing. \"I can't remember the last time I had one of those.\" I crack the mini bar open. As the family of a fighter, we get complimentary beverages. I fully intend on taking advantages. \"All the more reason to have one,\" I say and set about making Long Islands. Tess watches, buzzing with excitement. We have one, drink and then another. I am unaware that our volume is getting louder as we consume. At one point I am up, third beverage in hand, yelling Tess down and she attempts to get me to dance. \"Do it!\" she shouts, giggling, slumped over in a hotel chair. \"Ok!\" I agree, bouncing down off of the bed. \"I'll teach you.\" Some small part in the back of my mind knows that I am trying to distract myself from the worry of what might happen in the next few days. I take another swallow, feeling the drink burn down the back of my throat. After another gulp of liquid courage, I set my glass down and begin teaching Tess Beyonce's Single Ladies dance. I am halfway through demonstrating a hip rolling motion when the door to our room flies open. Tess immediately sits down, looking ashamed, but it takes me slightly longer to come to my senses. I spin around, and feel the world begin to turn on its axis. I begin to topple over. Tommy catches me. \"Damn baby,\" he pulls me into his arms. He smells good, like the Irish Springs soap he uses. I bury my face in his chest, inhaling. \"You showered,\" I murmur, pleased as punch. \"Jesus…\" I think it is Paddy's voice that I hear but I can't be sure. \"She's gone.\" There is laughter in the room around me. All I can focus on though, is the feel of Tommy's chest against my face. He says something about needing to sober me up and then I am being moved, transferred through the adjoining door and into our room. \"What got into you?\" he asks me. He lowers me slowly to the bed and attempts to let me go, but I drag him down on top of me. \"A lot of liquor,\" my vision will not seem to clear. \"Kinda figured that,\" he sounds amused. \"Didn't take you for a partier.\" \"I'm not,\" I slur. \"It's just…\" I cannot seem to articulate my emotions. \"You know,\" Tommy brushes the hair out of my eyes, \"It ain't good to drink away your problems. I should know.\" I reach out and smooth my hands along his face. \"You're going to be all beat up tomorrow,\" I tell him. \"Wait till you see what the other guy's gonna look like.\" The alcohol in my system makes me feel like laughing, but I resist, trying to fight it. \"You know I love you, right?\" I feel compelled to ask. \"Yeah, Nicole,\" he kisses my ear. \"I know.\" \"Do you-\" I begin to ask but he shushes me. \"Let me take care of you for a change, baby,\" he whispers. His husky voice, combined with the light pressure of his lips on the tip of my ear, sends chills down my spine. I melt like butter in a pan against him, content to feel the warmth of his skin, to inhale his masculine scent, to taste him. \"Don't worry about me,\" he tells me after he has administered aspirin and water and changed me into one of his long shirts. \"On Sunday, it'll be over. And we'll be rich.\" I note his use of the plural instead of the singular \"I.\" \"I don't need money,\" I mutter. \"I just want you.\" He is silent so long that I think that he will not respond. He slides into bed behind me, wraps his arms around my chest and pulls me flush against him. I begin to drift to sleep despite the noise of people partying outside and in the halls. I cannot be sure of whether or not I'm dreaming, but I hear Tommy tell me, \"You've got me, babe.\" The thought gives me sweet dreams.[Chapter 24] Author's Note: Again, special thanks to my beta reader, Tullulah Lulah, who has been a tremendous help and thank you to those of you out there who review and message and keep me motivated. I'm happy you're all still hanging in there with me. Please let me know what you think about this installment! I have five minutes of alone time with Tommy after the first round. We have been together for upwards of an hour, but not alone. A nonstop barrage of trainers, physicians, therapists, reporters, security, and sponsors file in and out as though they are all queued outside of the locker room doors. I would not be surprised to find that they were. I watch it all in relative silence, smiling only when Tommy happens to glance my way. He still looks like himself, give or take a bruise or two. I know that by tonight it is possible that I might not be able to distinguish his facial features. I take them all in now, devouring him hungrily with my eyes, committing the sight to memory. With any luck, he will look like this on Sunday. I am not counting on it. At last, he waves everyone away. He commands enough respect that the strangers vacate at his bequest. Even his family walks outside, giving us a moment. \"What'd you think?\" he asks me. I can see the slight smile playing at the corner of his lips. I know he is looking for confirmation that his pride is well-founded, that I am proud of his achievements as well. I am happy to give it to him. \"I think it was certainly much shorter than Ramirez intended,\" I say, smiling. The first round of fighting, against a newcomer I was not familiar with, barely made it to five minutes before Tommy laid him out face down on the mat. The crowd had roared its approval, thrilled for a repeat of last year. I had let out a sigh of relief, but I had three more rounds to get through, and so did Tommy. I glance at the television set in the corner, watching Jackson knock his opponent out cold. I quickly avert my eyes. No need to dwell on the next few hours. I fix my attentions on my boyfriend. \"You think he's going to be ok?\" Tommy asks again, wiping his face with a warm towel. I am taken aback by his question. \"Ramirez?\" I ask. Tommy nods. \"He's going to have a hell of a headache, but I overheard someone say he's already conscious.\" Tommy nods more vigorously, fixing his eyes on some spot on the wall. \"Good,\" he says, standing up and popping his muscles. \"It's Jackson next,\" I say. \"Yup,\" he agrees, pulling on a plain black t-shirt. \"Are you ready?\" I ask. \"He better be,\" Tommy drops a kiss on my lips. \"I gotta talk to Pop and Brendan,\" he says. It is a dismissal, but a polite one. I understand that I am a distraction. It would not do to think lovey dovey thoughts when six feet of solid muscle is trying to wipe the floor with you. I return his kiss, wish him luck, and remind him that I will be cheering for him. He smiles at me and I return it, remembering Tess's advice, trying not to let my anxiety show. Later, I can barely hold down dinner. The food is tasteless in my mouth and I scarcely feel the textures on my tongue. I swill down some wine, attempting to calm my frayed nerves. \"Easy there,\" Brendan reaches out and lightly pushes my hand down, lowering the wine glass to the table, \"thought you had enough of that last night.\" I allow him and his wife a laugh at my expense, even going so far as to join in. It feels lovely to laugh. I remember that, for better or worse, this will all be done in 36 hours' time. I retreat back upstairs to prepare, understanding that if I am to be a fighter's girlfriend, I need to look the part. Tess had the benefit of anonymity last year, a luxury I am certainly not afforded. I glance through my meticulous suitcase, weighing the pros and cons of each outfit, glad for a distraction to occupy my thoughts. I settle on a little black dress that falls mid-thigh and has sheer shoulders and a beaded neckline. The black silk is cool against my heated skin. I take time with my hair, oiling it, curling it, fluffing it out. I line up makeup brushes, open little containers and assemble them as though I am about to paint a portrait. I am keenly aware that one mile down the road Tommy is also getting ready. So as he tapes up his knuckles and stretches his muscles, I dust colored minerals over my eyelids and gloss my lips. Satisfied, I stuff my feet into simple silver heels, grab my purse and join Tess downstairs where a car waits to shuttle us a block and a half down the street. She valiantly attempts to distract me on the car ride there, singing loudly to the radio and ribbing me into participating. I gamely play along, appreciative of her efforts, even as nervousness swells and roils in the pit of my stomach. It is a miracle that I navigate the carpeted floors and narrow walkways without tripping. I spot Gavin, hulking a head above everyone else in a sea of reporters. He waves, a camera balanced on his shoulder and I wave back, sincerely hoping that whatever he is about to film makes Tommy look good. Tess and I take our seats. I am aware how out of place we both seem. There is no posse sitting with us. Jackson's camp seems to consist of nearly everyone he knows. I glance over and catch Jackson's girl throwing me a snide look. In a fit of uncharacteristic anger, I consider getting the fight started earlier, but quickly regain sense. She will not be smirking after my man wipes the floor with hers. \"Nicole,\" Tess's voice draws my attention to her, \"are you ok?\" \"Just waiting for it to start,\" I say. It is true. The anticipation is worse than the fight. At long last the back beat of Rampage Jackson's intro music begins, pumping into the crowded hall through the surround sound speakers. The crowd erupts, roaring right back with Jackson as he swaggers down the tunnel to Al Kapone's You Ain't Stopping Me . He has his chain on, a heavy metal thing that he hands to his trainer with great ceremony before he climbs into the ring. His eyes are focused. He is here to win. I recognize his intensity as something I commonly see in Tommy. I try not to dwell on it. A low chanting starts from the opposite side of the ring and my head whips around. I recognize the song and am momentarily shocked that Tommy has finally chosen intro music and, more specifically, chosen a song that I love. He comes in, his brother and father behind him, looking every inch the beast in his black hoodie. Kanye West's Power plays loudly behind him. The cheering is deafening, mixed in with boos from his opponent's fans. I watch him march up the stairs, enter the ring and remove his sweatshirt. He glances in my direction, catching my eye for the briefest of moments. I smile, blow him a slight kiss. He nods at me. He and Jackson posture and flex, each trying their best to intimidate one another. It has no apparent effect. They meet in the center of the ring, only centimeters from the other's face. It reminds me of how dogs snarl and growl, ready to fight. I suck in a huge gulp of air, feeling the pressure tighten my chest. The referee gives his standard speech, lifts his hands and declares, \"Let's go to war!\" The bell rings, the fans explode and I stop breathing. Back and forth they dance, feeling the other out. It does not last long. Tommy goes in first, attacking with the ferocity that made him a household name. Jackson counters, landing as many blows as Tommy rains on him. I cannot see how there could be a clear winner, not when they seem so evenly matched. Every smack of bone on skin, every crack of muscle, every drop of blood engrains its image into my mind. By the end of round two, my internal organs have turned to liquid. Tommy is bleeding. Brendan washes it off his face, leans forward to tell him something. From the sidelines Paddy shouts and Tommy nods, jumping off the stool before the bell has even rung again. The two men meet yet again in furious competition. Tommy dives for Jackson's legs, attempting to take him down. Jackson swings his arms up and pounds back down, forcing Tommy under him. I feel panic overtake me, afraid Tommy might lose. But he is out of Jackson's grip just as quickly as he came to be in it. All at once he is on top, straddling Jackson. There is a flurry of fists. Tommy's hands come down, again and again, raining blows Jackson is blocking. The darker man keeps attempting to roll out, but Tommy holds him still, beating him on his arms, attempting to hit his face. Jackson is becoming visibly tired, but Tommy shows no signs of slowing. I wonder what nightmare is fueling him right now, what horror compels his fists to keep falling. I am aware that I am screaming, though I do not know what words I am using. I cannot hear my own voice over the cacophony that is the crowd. \"That's it! That's it!\" the referee is waving his arms. Tess leaps into me, jubilant, cheering. A TKO in Tommy's favor. Round two is over. Jackson looks worse for the wear as he is helped up by Tommy. He has so much blood on his face that I cannot believe that he can even see, but he reaches out and shakes Tommy's hand. I know that he is disappointed by his loss, but he is a good sport. I feel my respect for him grow. He exits the ring as Tommy is declared the winner. I swallow hard, pushing down the absurd urge to cry in relief. There are only two fights left. My relief is short lived once I get a closer look at the damage Jackson dealt my boyfriend. It puts me in mind of last year, the way Brendan looked after a fight. Tommy is no longer untouchable. He looks jubilant though, or as jubilant as I have ever seen him look. \"Two more,\" he tells me later around a mouthful of gauze. He spits into the sink to his side and I try to ignore the fact that his spit is as red as a fairytale apple. I smile and apply gentle pressure with a warm washcloth. His cuts are blessedly shallow. He is standing in a towel in our hotel bathroom, humoring me as I fawn over him. He bends over and rinses his mouth out. I am satisfied that his teeth are no longer stained the color of a cherry tomato. \"Who are you fighting?\" I ask him as he is climbing into the bathtub. Instead of steaming warm water, the porcelain tub is filled with ice. It looks absolutely miserable, but he climbs in like it is a Jacuzzi. \"Rua,\" he answers, shivering slightly as he lowers himself into the freezing water. A mental image of the huge Brazilian man flashes in my mind's eye. He has a penchant of knocking fighters out as frequently as Tommy does. He will not be able to beat the Jiu-jitsu master at his own game. I wonder if he has a plan. He looks as unconcerned as ever as he burrows into the ice, sighing. He sounds like a glass of lemonade every time he shifts position. I tell him so. \"Wanna join?\" he laughs. \"If it were warm,\" I say. I reach in and playfully splash him. \"Are you going to train tonight?\" \"Nope,\" he kicks a few cubes of ice at me, \"I'm all yours.\" As thrilled as I am to hear this, I cannot help but give him a skeptical look. \"Are you sure?\" \"I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be, baby,\" he closes his eyes and leans his head back against the rim of the tub. \"You've gotta distract me tonight. Think you can handle it?\" \"I have a few ideas,\" I kiss him gently. \"I'll see you when you're done being a Tommy-sickle.\" His laughter chases me out the door. I change out of my dress, sliding into the infinitely more comfortable ensemble of a t-shirt and jeans. I comb the artificial curls out of my hair, wipe off a layer of makeup and throw on some tennis shoes. The only thing I want tonight is to be alone with my man, walking around and looking at the sights. He does not protest when I tell him my plan. He dresses, grabs my hand and walks me outside. We end up on the beach, walking in companionable silence. We do not talk about the upcoming fights, we do not talk about fighting at all. It looms like a stormy cloud over our heads, but we refrain, instead choosing to talk about the movies we want to see, the places we want to go, and the things we want to do in the future. \"I'm thinking about moving,\" he tells me as we trudge through the sand. \"To where?\" I ask. I know that he does not want to continue splitting time between his brother's and his father's houses. \"Bristol,\" he says simply. I smile at the mere thought of that. It would be wonderful to have him every day, to see him after work. \"That would be nice,\" I tell him. \"Just nice?\" he asks. \"It'd be fan-fucking-tastic,\" I say with no trace of sarcasm. \"We'll talk about it after this is all over, I guess,\" he says, effectively bringing us back to the here and now. \"We better get back,\" he glances at his watch, \"I got an early start tomorrow.\" The morning dawns earlier than seems possible. I feel, rather than hear, Tommy get out of bed. I contemplate joining him before I catch a glimpse of the bedside clock. It is 4 in the morning. How he has the energy to even hold his eyes open, let alone go warm up, is a miracle to me. He is full of nervous energy. I watch him through hooded eyes as he gets his equipment ready and then bandages his knuckles. He walks to the door adjoining us to his brother's room and knocks. Brendan opens within seconds. The two converse in low deep voices before they begin gathering up gym bags. They make for the door, tip toeing. \"See you in a few hours, baby,\" I mumble. He turns and smiles at me. \"See ya.\" I drift in and out of sleep for the next few hours before the sun streaming through the crack in the curtains compels me to get up. I dress and then collect Tess. We eat breakfast downstairs and watch the speculation on the outcomes of the fights between the final four fighters. Tommy and Mauricio \"Shogun\" Rua command most of the attention, as they are the most evenly matched. Analysts debate, claiming that Rua has more experience but Tommy has more heart. One argues that heart does not win a fight, muscle does. The analysts laugh but I feel my stress level ratchet up a few notches. It will come down to who wants it more, they agree in the end. I sincerely hope that it is Tommy. The fight is scheduled for 1 pm, but Tess and I arrive just after noon. The place is already crowded. We catch the end of Jon Jones and Dan Henderson's match. Jones wins by majority decision, advancing to the finals. I shove the information to the back of my mind, resolved to worry about it after Tommy has won round three. By the time Rua's entrance theme begins playing, I am close to having a panic attack. The man is a beast, as inexorable as Tommy is said to be. I believe I am about to find out what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. It turns out that Tommy is the unstoppable force. He does indeed have a strategy: the ground and pound. The bell has barely rung when Tommy runs at Rua, grasping him around the waist, pulling him up and slamming him into the mat. Rua is as surprised as the spectators are. There are gasps and screams of delight and displeasure. All of Mauricio's skills in jiu-jitsu are for nothing now. He cannot get a hold on Tommy. It is like trying to hold onto smoke. Tommy beats him, reminding me of the hurting he put on Mad Dog Grimes last year. Rua gives it his best effort, but cannot break free. I realize, that for all of his brutality, Tommy has spent a great deal of time studying his opponents. The time he has put in strategizing with Paddy and Brendan is all coming to fruition. The horn blows before Tommy can knock Rua out and the two men break apart. Tommy returns to his corner, almost completely unscathed. Rua cannot say the same. Blood is running down his face, obscuring his vision and he is swaying like a character in Mortal Kombat . All that is left is to finish him off. The grand finale comes in the form of a dazzling kick halfway through round two. Rua does a decent job dancing away from Tommy, staying out of the range of his fists. Tommy sees his opening, striking hard and fast, his foot connecting solidly with Rua's head. He drops like a stone, hitting the mat with a resounding thud. I leap up, screaming wildly while Tess jumps around me. Brendan is smiling like it is Christmas morning from Tommy's side and even Paddy looks visibly pleased. Three down. One more to go. Now it is time to start worrying about Jon Jones. I hope Tommy has spent as much time watching Jones fight as he did Rua. It would be heartbreaking to come this far to lose.[Chapter 25] Author's Note: As always, special thanks to my beta reader, Tullulah Lulah, who is always so prompt with her corrections. Seriously, you are the best. And all you readers and reviewers, you all make my day with your kind comments and support. This story is slowly coming to a close, but I'm working to leave you all with a satisfying ending. This chapter is decidedly more \"M\" rated than the rest of the story. Please review! The horn blows, signaling an end to the second round of the finals. Jon \"Bones\" Jones has the technical advantage over Tommy. He is harder to get a hold of than an eel, twisting and turning with ease, using his 6'4'' form to his advantage. His style is unorthodox, a mixture of spinning kicks and elbows that I believe Tommy is only avoiding because he studied them so thoroughly. Tommy has danced around the ring for ten minutes now, looking for an opening to take Jones down. He has not found it, but blessedly, Jones is struggling in the same category. The first ten minutes of the fight have been like sitting on pins and needles for me. The two men have traded blows, some that looked to be fight ending, but miraculously, both are still on their feet. Their experience in wrestling means that they both execute well on the mat. Tommy and Jones have been grappling with each other nonstop, but like octopi, both managed to wriggle out of the other's grasp. Now, Brendan tells Tommy something in their corner, but Tommy's eyes are fixed firmly on his opponent. They are gray as stones, following Jones like a lion watches his prey. It is now or never, and he knows it. Jones' trainers circle him, wiping blood from his eyes and squirting water in his mouth. If he is worried at all about the outcome of ht next round, he is not showing it. He looks as calm as if her were sitting watching someone else spar in training. He spits his water out and jumps up, dancing back and forth like a tiger in a cage. The crowd is holding its collective breath, waiting for what is going to happen next. The referee walks almost tentatively to the center of the ring, like a man trying to break up a dogfight. He raises his hand high in the air, waiting for the signal. The horn blows and his arm arcs down. Tommy explodes out of the corner the moment round three begins, arms swinging. Jones attempts an elbow to the back of Tommy's neck, but Tommy blocks it. Jones backs up and resets, diving in, grabbing Tommy around the waist and taking out his legs. I give a startled cry, dread seizing me. Tommy goes down hard, the smack of his skin on the mat resounding even over the din of the crowd. I leap to my feet, cursing, half wishing I could run into the ring and pull Jones off my man. Jones tries the move that Tommy is famous for: the ground and pound. But Tommy has no intention of going out like that. He swings up his legs, tipping Jones up over his head. The move takes Jones by surprise, allowing Tommy the opportunity to leap away. He does not try to pin Jones, or lock him into any kind of hold. I am startled by this, wondering what his strategy could possibly be, especially when he permits Jones to struggle back to his feet. The second he regains his balance Tommy strikes out with a punishing blow straight to his face. The crack resounds through the arena and Jones is thrown back. Before he straightens out Tommy fires a quick jab and a right hook, knocking his opponent sideways. Jones sways and Tommy hits again, this time behind the ear. As Jones falls forward, Tommy pulls up a knee, smashing it into his chest. There is a moment where time seems to be suspended. Very clearly I am able to take in all of the details: the crowd leaping to their feet in waves, like the ocean in the midst of a storm, the referee lurching forward, Brendan leaping in delight just outside of the ring, Paddy wearing an expression of anxiety and, most importantly, the look of surprise and disappointment on Jones's face as he realizes it is all over. He goes down, slumping to the floor like a toppled deck of cards with 45 seconds left to go in the round. The referee calls it, but it does not matter; the crowd knows who has won. Cameras are jockeying for position, trying to get in the cage. I see Brendan take a flying leap and start climbing faster than I ever thought humanly possible. He does not wait for Tommy to meet him, but rather flips himself over the metal barrier in an impromptu display that is so impressive I wish I had a camera to capture the moment. He drops down straight into his little brother's arms. Tommy claps him around the shoulders, pulling him into him hard, seemingly too overwhelmed for words. They smile at each other, grinning broader than the public has ever seen them grin. All at once, Brendan grabs his brother's hand and swings it up, holding it above them. Tommy looks off at something just behind him, gesturing with his free hand. His movements become more authoritative and I realize he is calling someone. I push forward, Tess right behind me, trying to get ringside. We get just close enough to see Paddy's head begin to emerge. He walks in slow steps, betraying his age. He is almost tentative, as though he cannot believe what is happening. Tommy is having none of it. Together, he and Brendan bend down, pulling their dad up to them. Tommy clasps his father's arm, gives him a crooked smile and then drags his hand up. All three men stand there in some moment all of their own, isolated in a crowd of strangers by some private bonding. Paddy is clearing crying; the salty tears flow silently down his cheeks as he watches Tommy shake Jones' hand and receive his belt. Tommy swings the heavy metal up onto his shoulder, positioning it between himself and Brendan. It is a far different scene than last year, when Brendan all but carried his little brother down the stairs and into the locker room, pushing the cameras away. Now all three men stand together, looking so much like a happy family that it is difficult to comprehend the emotional state they were all in last year. I glance to my right and see that Tess is crying as freely as she did when Brendan won, her lips pulled back in a wide smile. I chance a glance at them too, feeling the emotion weighing heavily behind my own eyes. Tommy looks down at me, grinning that crooked grin of his. I blow him a kiss, wanting desperately to run t him. I am keenly aware that I could damage his street credibility, so I allow him his manly moment, content to stand on the outskirts. He will be mine in a few short minutes. He begins his descent out of the cage, slowly making his way down the tunnel. Through the throng he reaches for me, yanking me to his side. His skin is sweat-slicked but I do not care. I grasp his hand, walking with the Conlon family down the tunnel to the locker rooms; I am a part of Tommy's inner circle now, not an outsider or a reporter. I have been accepted into the fold. The next few hours are a raucous blend of interviews. I am on the other end of the camera this time, sitting side by side with Tommy. A few reporters attempt to pull Tommy out of our little group but he stubbornly refuses to move, leaving them scrambling to find a shot that doesn't include all of us. Brendan and Paddy are asked their fair share of questions. The media is having a field day with the double threat that is the Conlon brothers. Two wins in a row like this have never happened before. My facial muscles grow tired from the incessant smiling, but I cannot seem to relax them. Tommy's hand stays wrapped around mine as he speaks in clipped phrases to the reporters. When they finally clear off Tommy takes a moment to shower and pull himself together. He is expected to go out, to make an appearance and rub shoulders with his fans. I know this is not his forte, but he goes willingly, even pulling on an outfit made exclusively from Hanes cotton. It is an outfit I packed for him, a nice button down black shirt and jeans that have not been completely faded by use. He leaves the top buttons of his shirt undone, exposing his undershirt, and pushes the sleeves up to the elbow. I stop him, rolling the material back down and smoothing it out, folding it up so that it is more presentable. \"You have to look good, baby,\" I half-tease, straightening his collar. \"Figured you were doing that,\" he takes in my bronze cocktail dress with a smirk. \"Well,\" I brace my hands on his shoulders, \"you need to keep up.\" I kiss him lightly on the lips. I turn around and he gives me a playful smack on the bottom. We walk outside, poking and play shoving each other like children. Tommy swings me up, holding my feet just off of the ground until I agree to stop tickling him. I would venture to say that he is bordering on giddiness. He is certainly boyishly happy. Tess, Brendan and Paddy meet us, all similarly dressed up. Paddy has put on a button down that looks like it has seen better days, but it is strangely endearing. He has left his newsboy cap in the hotel room and keeps running his hand through his gray hair nervously. Tommy punches him lightly in the shoulder. For whatever reason, it relaxes him. He leads the way into the restaurant, loudly announcing to the hostess that we are there to celebrate. We eat dinner, just the five of us. Plates and plates of food roll out, appetizers varying from sticky mozzarella sticks to calamari, salads that go largely untouched, and dishes loaded with steak, potatoes, vegetable, chicken and pasta roll though on an endless carousel of waiters. The food is all on the house, even the bottles of expensive champagne. Paddy toasts with apple cider, leading our group in recounting the fight. We laugh about moments that terrified us while they were happening. We hear the story of the finals from everyone's perspective, but it never feels repetitive. Tommy's is of course the most fascinating point of view, though he is the least loquacious in his telling of it. People surround our table and stare, but it does not bother us. This moment, no matter how many people witnessed it, is for the Conlon family. We end up stuffed to bursting and standing outside on the boardwalk, breathing in the cool evening air. The evening is filled with promises, but no one can seem to come to a decision about what to do. Paddy retires when night falls, claiming he is too old to hang with us all. I know that he is taking himself out of temptation's way. His boys smile and tell him good night before we all head out to the block party on the boardwalk. The music is loud, the liquor is free and spirits are high. Tommy gets dragged up onto a stage where he rallies the crowd into a frenzy with a few grunted words. He gamely signs autographs, leaning over a hastily constructed barrier, marker in hand. He gestures for Brendan to join him, but his brother shakes his head, trying to allow Tommy his moment. Tommy will not be persuaded. He jerks his brother to him, hands him another marker and drags him along. I believe he draws some comfort from Brendan's presence. Brendan enjoys it as well. They are the most alive and carefree when they are together. They laugh, taking pictures, joking with fans. Finally, Tommy decides enough is enough and they excuse themselves, returning to Tess and I. I feel energy burning in the pit of my stomach, mixing in with my pride for Tommy. Every second I spend watching him, no matter what he is doing, the fire grows. My blood is running hot now. Tommy detects this in my eyes. \"What's wrong?\" his arm feels impossibly heavy on my waist. I want to tell him to wrap me to him tightly, to kiss me like he means it. Instead, I ask him to dance. He raises an eyebrow, but I am in no mood for him to refuse me. I see him cast his brother a look that is somewhere between amusement and nervousness, but I drag him somewhere the cameras aren't pointed. The music bumps a heavy bass beat and I begin to sway, my hands locked on his around my waist. I am pleasantly surprised when he pulls me into him, rocking just the slightest to the beat. There is nothing overly sensual about our movement and I long to take it to the next level but there are too many eyes watching. Just the sight of Tommy Conlon dancing causes a flurry of movement as fans rush towards us. Before the DJ can even mix in the next song we are surrounded by increasingly drunken couples. I hear Tommy's laughter over the music as he catches sight of Brendan and Tess dancing a few feet over. The boardwalk becomes a club in a matter of minutes. Tommy pulls me closer to him and I glance at his face. He looks completely happy. He is even smiling. As the light of the day fades and we get more lost in the crowd, I become bolder with my movements. I rock backwards into him, throwing a swivel to my hips. I am fully aware that I am playing a dangerous game, that anyone might see us. But people are so wrapped up in their own debauchery that they pay us no serious attention. Tommy's grip on my waist tightens until it is almost painful. I desperately want to kiss him. Throwing caution to the wind, I spin around to face him. He meets me halfway. The passion of it is so intense that it robs me of breath. I lean up on my tip-toes, trying to get closer to him. When someone wolf-whistles loudly at us, I am successfully returned to the here and now. I pull back with a gasp. Tommy leans into me, his lips right at my ear. \"Let's go,\" he tells me. I have no mind to argue. We wave goodbye to Tess and Brendan who are wrapped around each other, enjoying some beers. The walk back to the hotel is longer than it has any right to be. There are people every few feet clamoring for Tommy's attention. He makes attempts to be polite to them all, but after a half hour, his patience has worn thin. \"This way,\" he tells me, pulling me down a side street. We zigzag around through back streets, sticking to shadowed areas I would never dare walk alone. But with Tommy holding my hand, I am confident that nothing will happen to us. He convinces hotel security to usher us in the back way. We take the service elevator and practically sprint down the hall into our room. He enters first, flipping on the light, pulling me in after him. The urgency in his actions reminds me of our first time together. He kisses me again, gently this time, steering me over to the bed. \"One second,\" he says. He disappears into the bathroom. I wait for him. His Sparta belt sits on our hotel room bed, gleaming against the puce colored sheets. I trace the cool metal with my fingers and run my hands over the supple leather of his belt. I sit cross legged on the bed, eagerly awaiting his return. Watching him fight, knowing that it is all over, that we can start talking about future plans that do not involve Sparta, has me all riled up. \"You like it?\" he asks, emerging from the bathroom in only his boxers briefs. The sight of him, muscled like an Adonis, sets my blood pressure up a few notches. \"It's beautiful,\" I say. I forgot that we are talking about the belt. \"Want to wear it?\" he asks, walking towards me. I unfold my legs and lean back on my arms. \"It might clash with my dress,\" I tell him teasingly. \"So take your dress off,\" he says. It could be a lighthearted comment, but something in the deep timbre of his voice makes me sure he is not joking. His pupils dilate, the grey blue irises shrinking into a thin line. My breath catches in my throat and my hands begin to shake as I reach behind me to lower the zipper. Tommy becomes inpatient and his calloused palms circle me, grasping the small metal piece and yanking it down. He makes short work of my outfit, disregarding the sanctity of the fabric as he tosses it into an unsightly pile on the floor. \"I'd rather see you in the belt,\" I tell him against his lips. \"I wore it already,\" he tells me, increasing the pressure of his mouth against mine. \"But you earned it,\" I say. He kisses me on my collarbone, his damp hair brushing against the bottom of my chin. \"You were amazing,\" I continue, my breath coming in gasps as his attentions wander lower, \"Tommy, I am so proud of you.\" His head whips up, his lips claiming mine in a bruising kiss. His fingers press into the skin of my abdomen and I reach down, twisting my slender fingers around his. He pulls me into his cloth-covered lap. He presses me down hard against his thighs. I pull back, breaking our kiss. He watches me through hooded eyes as I reach for his championship belt and stand up. It is far too large to sit on my waist, but I swing it around anyway, pulling it closed and holding it there with my hands. \"What do you think?\" I ask him playfully. He smiles. \"Come here,\" he stands up, dropping his last scrap of clothing to the floor. I feel my eyes drop unconsciously to his naked body and my heated skin flares into an inferno. Tommy reaches for me, jerking my hips into his. Skin meets skin in a feverish dance. He lifts me into his arms, removing the thin lace of my bra and panties that is the only barrier between us. I expect him to carry me to bed, but instead he turns us against the nearest wall. One arm is under my legs, the other is pressed palm down against the wallpaper. Coherent thought flees my mind as he slams home in one hard movement, nearly causing my eyes to cross. His name is ripped from my lips and I lean backwards, helpless against him. Not that I am complaining. Tommy is thrusting like a man possessed. My hands come to the back of his neck and I jerk his head towards mine, plundering his mouth while he pumps against me. My legs feel weak, my muscles shaking, and a coil tightens in the pit of my stomach, begging to be released. My name falls from his mouth with so much reverence that it could be a prayer. I feel myself fall apart against him. My body goes limp in his arms. He pulls back slightly, lifting me away from the wall and walking us backwards. The back of his legs hit the mattress and we topple downward, my hair arching over us. I fall forward against his chest, my head landing in the crook of his shoulder. My breathing is labored, but I have gained my second wind. On and on we go, like a marathon, until I feel ready to pass out. Hard and fast, slow and gentle, we continue making love until Tommy is finally spent. I lay beside him, our legs twisted together, one of his hands in my hair, his other sandwiched between our bodies, tangled with mine. I listen to the slow rhythm of his breathing. \"I've got money now,\" he says, sounding like he cannot quite believe it. \"You do,\" I agree. \"You worked your ass off for it.\" \"I can buy a place in Bristol,\" he continues. A small smile tugs the corner of his mouth. \"You could buy a whole block,\" I laugh. \"What kind of house do you like?\" he asks quietly, unable to quite meet my eyes. \"I get input?\" I ask. \"Well, you're going to live there,\" he says as though this is obvious. \"Are you going to be there too?\" I tease. He moves his hand from my hair, trailing it down my stomach. \"I better be. I don't wanna be your sugar daddy.\" The absurdity of that phrase coming from his mouth makes me laugh. \"Are you saying you're not sweet?\" \"I can be plenty sweet,\" he smirks. His hand dips between my legs, causing me to gasp. \"In that case,\" I roll my body upwards, arching my back, \"I want an old-fashioned looking house. A Colonial with a porch.\" \"Anything else?\" he asks against my skin. \"And big windows.\" I reach out, pressing my palm against his abs. \"And a yard.\" \"How big?\" \"Huge,\" I sigh as he moves against me. \"Need kids for a big house,\" he observes. \"Then we will need to have some. Two girls and two boys,\" I say. Tommy grasps me tighter. \"Sounds like a plan.\" The implications of what he is saying begin to sink in. \"Kids are a lifetime commitment,\" I say. He braces his hands on both sides of my face, bringing my eyes to meet his. His lips brush over mine in a languorous wet kiss. \"Sounds good to me.\" As if to drive his pronouncement home, he shifts his hips, entering me. I desperately hope that Brendan, Tess, and Paddy are out as I scream. We fall into a lazy sort of pattern of dozing off only to be woken up again by the other's desire. Eventually, even Tommy is worn out. I close my eyes, drifting into a deep sleep in Tommy's protective arms. My dreams are wonderful, pictures of a life together, of what we could be now. I vaguely feel Tommy absentmindedly playing with my fingers, a habit he has developed when he sleeps. The motion is so comforting to me now that I find it difficult to sleep without it. His rough fingers trace a path up to the tips of the fingers on my left hand. Suddenly I feel a different texture than the familiar pattern of his skin. I open my eyes, blinking blearily. A platinum band is sitting on my left ring finger, with a sparkling diamond in a round brilliant cut gleaming from the center. Now that I have realized it is here, the weight of it feels immense. I feel my breath catch as I stare at it, unbelieving. I go so far as to pinch myself, surprised at the sting it causes on my forearm. \"Tommy,\" I roll over to look at him. \"Tommy what is this?\" He is looking at me, his azure eyes faintly lit in the darkness. \"What's it look like sweetheart?\" he asks. His voice is quiet, but not heavy with sleep. It is obvious that though I have been dozing off, he has not. \"You tell me,\" I say. My heart feels like it will pound out of my chest. \"You know what it is,\" he reaches for my hand, spinning the ring around my finger with a broad thumb. \"No I don't,\" I say, truthfully. \"Not until you ask the question.\" We stare at each other, the novel weight of the ring on my finger hanging between us. \"I had a whole speech,\" he swallows thickly, \"Practiced it with Brendan and everything.\" \"So tell me,\" I suggest gently. \"It was something about me loving you and being really happy when I'm with you…\" he trails off, sitting up and throwing back the covers. \"And wanting to be with you forever.\" His voice gets a little bit stronger. \"I was going to get down on one knee,\" he says, kneeling. \"I was planning on wearing clothes when I did it,\" he admits. We are both nude as our birth day. I lean over to the bedside table and flip on the lamp. Since he is kneeling naked on the hotel floor, literally baring himself to me, I let the sheet around me fall and place my feet firmly on the floor. \"I like you better without clothes,\" I tell him. My joke visibly relaxes him. He exhales deeply and then straightens his shoulders. \"I don't think I was ever really happy until I met you,\" he says. \"And now, I'm only really happy when you're around. And I like it,\" he runs his hands through his hair, visibly nervous. \"I know I'm a pain in the ass sometimes, and I know I'm grumpy and can be a jerk, but for some reason you've hung in there with me for a year now. And I was hoping you might hang in there with me for the rest of our lives.\" He licks his lips, staring up at me, his expression nervous and expectant all at once. \"Nicole,\" he slips the ring off of my finger and holds it up, \"Will you marry me?\"[Chapter 26] Author's Note: So sorry for the crazy delay! Between work and writer's block, I know I've been bad updating. Thanks to Tallulah for getting me back on track and thank you to all of you for being so patient. There's an epilogue coming, and I promise you won't have to wait two weeks for it! My hand sits in Tommy's rough palms. I feel my fingers involuntarily flex against his calloused skin. He is looking at me with almost childlike anticipation. I feel as though a balloon is expanding inside of my chest. This moment is unexpected, to say the least. My mind races as I try to put together the pieces in the puzzle of events that have led us here. Even though my appraisal of the ring is amateur at best, it is clear that it did not come cheap. The yellow diamond sparkles from its platinum band. It is truly beautiful, more so for what it represents than its exterior. This ring took time to select, and planning. \"Tommy,\" I swallow thickly, choking down emotion, \"when did you get this?\" \"Right after my birthday,\" he seems taken aback by my question. I feel my eyes begin to well over. Tommy looks panicked. I want to reassure him, but I simply cannot find the words. \"Nicole,\" he begins to stand up and move towards me, but I reach out with my right hand and push down on his shoulder. He settles down, looking up at me with a concerned expression. I maintain my hold on him, drawing strength from the warmth of his skin. The white hills of raised scar tissue, the dark ink of his tattoos are all marks that I have become familiar with. I know this man, inside and out, better than I have known anyone before. There is no one I would rather wake up next to every morning, no one I would rather have by my side when I cry or feel sick. He is the one who I want to tell the details of my day to, the person who my mind wanders to in quiet moments. I want him with me every day. I want to fall asleep in his arms, have his children, and bait him for that crooked smile of his. I want to marry him. \"Yes,\" I say, steadying my voice. I look directly into his indigo eyes. Everything I have ever wanted is reflected in them. \"Yes, you'll marry me?\" he asks slowly. I nod, sliding my hand from his shoulder to the base of his neck. \"I want to marry you,\" I say, leaning into him. \"Tommy, I want to marry you.\" \"Then why are you crying?\" his palm flattens against my back, stirring up immediate goose bumps. \"I thought you were never going to ask,\" I say into his shoulder, feeling ridiculous. To my surprise, he chuckles. \"Had to get the balls to do it first.\" He kisses me gently and pulls back. \"You want your ring?\" I nod again, more zealously. He takes my hand. I notice we are both trembling. With the shyest smile I have ever seen grace his face, he slides the metal over my ring finger. When it reaches its destination, he grasps my hand tightly in his own. I study our intertwined fingers, the differences in color and size and texture, twisted so closely it is hard to tell where one begins and the other ends. He holds me against him, chest to chest. I am stuck by the absurdity of the situation, the two of us naked on the floor of the same hotel we met in. A year ago he was broken and angry at the world. A year ago I cared only for my work, solely for the story. And here we are now. I lean up to kiss him, brushing my lips softly across his. He lets me set the pace, his hands tip toeing across my body like we have all the time in the world. I unfold my legs and begin to stand, slowly enough so that he rises with me. I settle back onto the bed, lost in a tangle of sheets and the sensations Tommy is causing. He settles his considerable weight over me, careful as always to not put too much pressure on my body. I run my hands over the contours of his muscles, the hard angles of his thighs and abdomen, the smooth curves of his pectorals and biceps. I have forever to feel him like this, until both of us are old and sagging, until age has dimpled our skin and grayed our hair. The thought is elating. \"I love you,\" he tells me, pulling his lips away for the barest of moments. \"I always will.\" He nibbles my lower lip and I open for him, like a flower to the dawn. \"I love you,\" I whisper, over and over again. Every touch is like an electric shock, sizzling through my limbs, leaving me tingling. I feel a surge of energy, as though I am capable of amazing physical feats. I exercise my newfound strength to roll us over until I am on top of Tommy. Since words have failed me tonight, I will take a page out of his book and find some nonverbal way to tell him how I feel. If his groans of pleasure are any indication, he is perfectly content with this arrangement. I brace my hands on his chest for leverage, filled with energy, even at this ungodly hour. I feel as strong as Tommy does in the ring, untouchable. Until tonight, I have only ever experienced shades of this sensation, but now it all comes swooping in. It is a heady mixture. \"Nicole,\" Tommy rumbles underneath me, \"Nicole, Nicole, Nicole.\" I realize his name is leaving my lips as frequently as he is saying mine. Our voices form a kind of rhythm, as consistent as a metronome. After a while they meld together, one sound, the syllables indistinguishable. The familiar tingling begins in the pit of my stomach, expanding through my limbs like lightening, pulling me over the edge and taking Tommy with me. For a moment, I am disappointed tonight has to end, that I have not had sufficient time to experience everything it has to offer. But then Tommy rolls me over in that familiar way, pressing his body to mine like two puzzle pieces coming together. \"Looking forward to falling asleep like this every night for the rest of my life,\" Tommy's hands rub a soothing pattern into the skin on my back. His voice thrums against my body, relaxing me. \"Me too,\" I kiss him gently. This time we actually do fall into a deep, content sleep. The next morning is surreal, and I find myself checking my left hand often to confirm that it was not all a dream. Judging by the expressions on their faces, his family is unsurprised by our engagement. Tess demands to see the ring. As she squeals over it, complimenting Tommy's taste and congratulating the both of us, I see Brendan and Tommy talking quietly to each other in the background. Tommy breaks into a huge smile at something his brother says and the two of them hug, albeit quickly and manly. I accept the hugs from the Conlon family and am especially touched with Paddy. \"Welcome to the family,\" he says in that gruff voice of his, \"Take care of my boy.\" I hug him back tightly. Whatever he once was, he is a loving parent now. \"I promise,\" I whisper to him. He smiles at me and then the moment is over. There are plane rides to catch, work to return to, interviews to attend, and children to go home to. \"I love you,\" Tommy says to me as he drops me off at the airport. \"I'll see you real soon.\" I miss him before my plane even takes off, but comfort myself with the fact that soon, we will be together. To distract myself, I use the flight time to create a list of people who need to be called. I start at the top with family, but as I add more names, coworkers and friends, I realize the impossible task set before me. I literally want to tell everyone—the man sitting next to me, the stewardess, and the pilot, and anyone who will listen. Instead, I bite my tongue, trying to remember that anything I say has a likelihood of ending up on an MMA blog. However, I cannot refrain from calling my mother and father the moment I land, before I even make it to the baggage claim. I do not even bother to say hello before I blurt out my good news. \"You are what?\" my mother sounds like she is driving on the other end of the line. \"Engaged,\" I practically shout it into the mouthpiece. \"To Tommy?\" I cannot decide if her shock offends me or not. \"Obviously, mom,\" I tell her, fighting through the crowd to reach my luggage. There is a scuffling on her end and then a noise of squealing tires and then the sounds of traffic fade away. \"Start over,\" she instructs me, \"from the beginning.\" I carefully recount the details, tip toeing around any mention of nudity. I describe the ring as best as I can, but my mother is not concerned with jewelry. \"How do you feel?\" she asks. I pause for a moment, searching for an adjective strong enough. \"Jubilant,\" I say at last. \"And…?\" she prompts. \"Excited,\" I continue, \"A little bit nervous.\" \"Why?\" \"Well, we are taking two lives and making one and I suppose…\" I switch the phone to my other ear and lunge for my bag, \"I suppose that is a lot to take in.\" \"Are you moving?\" she continues to interrogate me. \"No,\" I say. \"He is.\" \"Into your house?\" \"We haven't discussed it that far. I think though, we are going to look for a family house.\" \"Are you pregnant?\" this time, her panic is evident. \"Mom, no. One thing at a time,\" I sigh. I hear her exhale hard. \"That's good.\" She says. \"This is good.\" \"Really?\" I ask. \"It sounds like you are freaking out.\" \"Well, my daughter is getting married,\" she tells me, considerably more calm now. \"To a man I've only met once. Clearly, your father and I are going to have to make a trip out to visit. We need to congratulate you face to face.\" \"So you are happy?\" I feel my childish need for her approval creep back in. \"Oh, hon, you could do a whole lot worse than Tommy. And frankly, he is lucking out getting you.\" She laughs. \"Your dad and I watched his tournament on television. He's quite the athlete isn't he? How much does he work out?\" \"A lot,\" I join her in laughing. \"Well,\" she says simply, \"that must be pleasant for you.\" My laughter escalates into something more hysterical. I am fully aware of some of the strange looks I am receiving. My mother continues asking for details, prying about where we were, what he said, what I said in response. Eventually I admit we were in bed at the time. I expect her to become awkward after I divulge that detail, but instead she confides that my father's proposal to her was similar. As much as I could go without the mental image, there is something comforting in the parallel. My parents are happy together, and I could do a lot worse than being the kind of wife that my mother is. Telling my father is a similar experience, though he is not as interested in the romantic details. The women at work and my girlfriends are a completely different story. They clamor to see the ring and immediately set about appraising its shape and color, complimenting Tommy's taste. The sight of my ring seems to embolden them, and after they grow bored with the story of the proposal, they begin asking far more personal things, specifically about our sex life. I suspect that they have been dying to ask these questions since they found out I was dating Tommy. I am tempted, in my perpetual state of giddiness, to give them a few details, so I throw them a few nuggets of information. Sure enough, news goes out online that Tommy and I are engaged. I refrain from reading too much of it. Some of it is not flattering at all, especially from Tommy's more feverous female fanatics. Tommy calls every night. Sometimes our conversations are long, sometimes they are squeezed in between television spots, but always they end with an \"I miss you.\" It is borderline intolerable, the longing I feel, especially at night. I am reminded of what Tess said about wrapping your life around a man. My inner feminist roars, trying to coax up the attitude of younger me, the no nonsense, no prisoners Nicole I was a year ago. I like this Nicole better, the kind who can be as silly as I want to be and not feel judged, the kind who knows that my man is skilled at soothing me when I rage over whatever work thing that has gotten me riled up. I like that I am the one most capable of coaxing him into a smile or a laugh, the one who best understands his moods. I love that though I am lying here missing him, somewhere, not so far away, he is missing me too. Our reunion is unexpected, at least for me. I stroll into work nearly three weeks after Sparta, balancing coffee and paperwork. Gavin meets me almost at the door. \"We need to work on that piece for the upcoming draft,\" I tell him, my mind buzzing with work to be done. \"We'll get to it,\" my friend pulls the paper out of my hand, relieves me of my coffee and turns me firmly in the opposite direction of the editing booths. \"Gavin, what-?\" I begin to ask. \"Someone's been waiting for you,\" he jerks his head in the direction of my desk. \"Who?\" \"Go see,\" he says with a little push. I navigate my way through the cubicles until I come face to face with my fiancé. He is seated at my desk, feet up, looking tan and radiantly happy. \"Play hooky with me?\" he asks in lieu of a greeting. We make record time to the parking lot. \"I've got a surprise,\" he says. We are seated in my car, but Tommy is driving, speeding down the streets with purpose. \"What is it?\" I ask. \"You'll see,\" he smiles at me, leaning over at a red light to lay a bruising kiss on my lips. Ten minutes later he pulls in front of an open house sign sitting on an immaculate emerald green lawn. A white colonial is perched in the center of the lot, looking like a jewel nestled on green felt. Its walls are all ivory colored boards of wood accented by sapphire shutters and a ruby front door. I step out of my car with my mouth hanging open. Without a word, Tommy grabs my hand and leads me inside. \"What do you two think?\" the realtor, a pretty blonde, asks us as we take the grand tour. The sun is streaming in through large shuttered windows onto the cream colored hardwood floors. The rooms are spacious, almost to the point of absurdity. My mind flashes back to my little place, with its rooms filled to bursting. There is a redbrick fireplace, walls already painted a lovely shade of olive. There is a backyard big enough for a jungle gym and a garden and maybe even a pool. There is space here to not only start a family, but to raise one as well. \"What do you think, babe?\" Tommy echoes. \"I think,\" I pause, looking around, \"this is it.\" \"Do you want to look at more?\" he asks. \"We probably should,\" I admit. The realtor looks a little bit crestfallen, but logic wins. We spend the next two weeks bouncing around on weekends, looking at red brick houses, two story behemoths and sprawling ranch styles. They are all beautiful in their own unique way, but the white house has me. Tommy agrees. By the time the keys are in our possession, Tommy is a full time resident of Bristol and our life together can officially begin. \"Well,\" Tommy begins as he sits the last of what feels like thousands of boxes down on the ground. The living room is packed wall to wall with our belongings. I am exhausted from carrying things, even though Tommy admittedly did most of the heavy lifting. Still, it is a strange feeling to be here, one half of a couple, instead of alone a few miles down the road. My house is officially on the market and no longer technically mine. My home is with Tommy now. \"Well, what?\" I ask him, flopping down on the couch. It is the only uncovered bit of furniture we have. Even our bed, a brand new, four poster behemoth, is still sitting in a box upstairs. \"We're in,\" he says, falling down next to me. I scoot my legs over, but he pulls them into his lap. \"Well, almost,\" I say with a laugh, \"we still have a lot to unpack.\" \"It can wait,\" he tells me, pulling my shoes off one by one. His fingers feel amazing as they massage my sore feet. \"We need to at least get some things out,\" my head lolls backwards, \"like the bed.\" \"Why?\" he asks. \"We can fit right here.\" To prove his point, he pushes me backwards, stretching out over me. \"One track mind,\" I mock scold him, even as I reach my arms up to embrace him. \"With you babe,\" he kisses me, \"it's always gonna be that way.\" I smile against his mouth as we share our first kiss in our new home.[Chapter 27] Author's Note: This is it! It is finally done! A thousand thank yous to all of the readers, reviewers and well-wishers, and a special thank you to my beta, Tallulah. I hope you all enjoyed! \"Babe, are you ready?\" I poke my head out of the bathroom to glance at my husband. He is standing in front of our floor-length mirror, looking like he might be sick. \"Hell no,\" he grunts at me. I have to agree with him: his shirt is unbuttoned, his tie is lying haphazardly on the edge of our bed and his brunette hair is in desperate need of a comb. I repress my sigh. \"You'll do fine,\" I say as I shove my chandelier earrings and Christian Louboutin gold sandals on hastily and walk towards him. \"Tell me what you're going to say,\" I instruct calmly. \"I don't know. I hate these goddamn things,\" he says, taking a shaky breath. \"They don't expect you to talk long,\" I say. I begin buttoning his shirt, starting at the bottom and working my way upward to his chin. \"I don't want to talk at all,\" he sounds as petulant as one of our sons. I tell him so. \"Where are the kids?\" he asks. \"They've been quiet too long.\" The words have scarcely left his mouth when we hear a bang from down the hall that sounds like something heavy has fallen. We exchange eye contact, silently counting to ten, exercising a tried and true parenting method. I barely make it to 7 before I am yelling. \"Eddie! Nick!\" My feet slide across our floor as I make for the door. I hear my sons scrambling, no doubt trying to get away. \"Nicole,\" Tommy grabs my arm, gently pulling me back. \"I've got it,\" he tells me. He stomps off down the hall, sounding like the big bad wolf. I know that once he gets to their room it will be a completely different story. I strain my ears to listen. \"What'd your mom say about fighting in here, huh?\" His voice is as loud and deep as ever, but there is no anger in it. \"Eddie, get off your brother, man.\" \"Daddy!\" I hear Nick's young, plaintive wail, \"Eddie put me in a choke hold!\" \"Did not!\" Eddie's voice is so loud it can be clearly heard. \"Stop being a baby!\" \"It hurt!\" Nick whines again. I begin moving toward the door with the intent of defusing the situation. \"Ed!\" Tommy only calls our eldest that when he means business. The boys both immediately snap to attention. \"What'd I say? Didn't we talk about this?\" \"Yes,\" I hear Eddie sounding shameful as I come down the hall. \"Why are you beating on your little brother?\" \"I just wanted to show him how to do one,\" Eddie complains. \"Na-uh!\" Nick begins to protest but Tommy cuts him off. \"Stop lying Ed. I already told you two that when you want to fight, you come to the gym with me and do it like men. Only cowards pick on people smaller than them.\" I think my husband is being too harsh, but I wait anyway, suspenseful for what he will say next. \"You guys are brothers. You have each other's back. You don't fight up here.\" \"You fought Uncle Brendan,\" Eddie has the stones to sound accusatory. He inherited a lot from his father, including his brass balled courage. \"In the ring,\" Tommy says. We have yet to tell the kids the complex details of their father's childhood. It is a subject we are in no hurry to broach. I push the bedroom door open and am greeted by the sight of my two sons standing sheepishly in front of Tommy. Their dress shirts are wrinkled, but I am happy to see they are still clean. There is no time to iron again though. My irritation ratchets up. \"Button your shirt boys,\" Tommy tells them, noticing my annoyance. They both immediately comply. \"You look pretty mommy,\" Nick tells me shyly. He is almost me in miniature, even down to his nature. But his eyes and mouth are the same shape as his father's, almond and plump, and his hair has soft waves to it that mine could never manage. \"Yeah, you do,\" Eddie adds. Standing next to Tommy, I am struck by how similar they are. With the exception of his darker skin, Eddie is Tommy in child form, even down to his occasional sullenness. He has a wild streak that has gotten us in the ER more times than I care to count, but he can be incredibly sweet when the mood strikes. \"Nick, go get Tina,\" Tommy instructs. My baby boy runs off gladly, socked feet sliding. I sense that Tommy has something to say to his oldest. \"Ed,\" he kneels in front of him, coming eye to eye with our 7 year old. \"You gotta stop picking on Nick. You ever see your uncle pick on me?\" \"No,\" Eddie pouts, refusing to make eye contact. \"And he's a good big brother. The best,\" Tommy says. I smile a little. \"You want to be like him?\" \"I want to be like you,\" Eddie even stomps his foot to drive his point home. I am struck by the sweetness of this sentiment and I wonder what Tommy will say. \"And I want to be like Uncle Brendan, so really, it's the same thing,\" Tommy tells him. I make a mental note to tell Tess. It is the only way Brendan will ever hear about this moment. Eddie seems to contemplate this for a moment. \"Ok,\" he says at last. It is the most Tommy will get out of him, but it is still an agreement. My husband is pleased. \"Get your shoes on. We're leaving soon.\" Tommy stands up and turns to me. I smile at him. \"You need to get ready too, come on,\" I say and take his hand to pull him back to our room. A half hour later our little family is packed into the car. Tina, our three year old, wears a dress in the same shade of gold as mine, though hers is more reminiscent of a Disney princess gown. She sits in her car seat, babbling happily to Nick who is holding her hand. Tina came out with wild, sand colored hair in the same shade as her uncle's and dark brown eyes that match mine. Her lips have the same plump pout as her father's and he is quick to cave every time she starts to wobble them and cry. Nick and Eddie, only a year apart, are wearing matching black vests over silver dress shirts, and their thick mats of hair have been combed into a respectable style. And Tommy finally has his black tie on, but has declined wearing a jacket. The first and last time he ever wore a tuxedo was our wedding 8 years ago. \"You let Bubba out?\" I ask as we pull onto the freeway. \"Yeah, the big guy's outside,\" Tommy says. One of the many dangers of living in a male dominated household is letting your sons and husband select the family pet. Two years ago we went to the pound with every intention of adopting an older, medium sized family dog. Instead we returned home with a wriggling, drooling, chubby St. Bernard puppy that has now evolved into something that resembles more horse than canine. But the boys and Tommy love him, and he has grown on me as well. I still am not strong enough to walk him though. That job still falls to Tommy and probably always will. \"Brendan's already there,\" I check my phone while Tommy drives. \"We'll get there,\" Tommy reassures me. \"We'd be there by now if someone hadn't spilled her apple juice all over the floor,\" I shoot my daughter a look in the rearview mirror. She promptly explodes into giggles. Tommy smirks at me and I cannot keep the smile off my face. Some things are just not worth getting upset over. \"Eddie, hold my hand,\" Tommy snags our son as we roll out of our car and begin rushing inside. A few people are still milling around outside the banquet hall. A few fighters wave, most notably Quinton Jackson. He is standing with his own family. Most of the rage has gone out of him by now and he and Tommy even have a friendly relationship. \"Better get in there, Conlons. They're trying to get started,\" he tells us. Eddie and Nick are already trying to make motions to go play with Jackson's boys but we pull them back. \"Let's go guys,\" hand in hand in hand in hand, we drag our children inside. Tommy is ushered away almost the moment we get through the door and we are shuffled over to where Brendan, Tess, Paddy and the girls sit. Tina rushes towards Emily and Rosie. The teen girls sweep their cousin up into their laps eagerly. My parents and oldest brother are stationed at the table right next to ours. Michael gives me a kiss on the cheek while Luke, now a college student and nearly a grown man, sportingly ruffles Eddie's hair. \"Thanks for coming,\" I kiss my parents as they fawn over their grandchildren. My dad is leaning over talking with Paddy in familiar tones. \"You guys barely made it,\" Brendan remarks easily, sipping his beer. \"The boys had a fight,\" I explain, sitting next to Tess. Brendan shrugs, \"When don't they?\" I laugh a little. It is true that life at our house can be…rambunctious. \"Does Tommy know what he is going to say?\" Tess asks me quietly as the MC calls for silence. All I can do is shrug my shoulders. I honestly have no idea. \"All right guys, let's get this started,\" UFC President Dana White begins the ceremony. \"This man coming up, he doesn't need any introduction. You know him as the best that's been ripping through fight after fight for years now. He's the two time winner of the Sparta tournament, the former Light Heavyweight champ, and just an all-around bad ass.\" My sons giggle a little at the word \"ass.\" I make a mental note to make sure they do not add it to their budding vocabulary. \"Tommy is also a hero; he is a Marine through and through. He fought for his country, returning from Iraq wounded from a bomb, but he still didn't quit. After recovering, he won Sparta and rose to be the biggest star in the UFC.\" The crowd, a mixture of Tommy's fans, UFC insiders, fighters and their families hoot their appreciation. \"But everything has to come to an end,\" White continues. \"Even the Mean Marine has to retire sometime. It's been a joy watching Tommy fight these past eight years and it is an honor for me to induct him into the UFC Hall of Fame. So without further ado,\" he gestures behind him to where Tommy is standing, \"Tommy Conlon!\" Tommy swaggers to the podium with the expression on his face that won him his nickname over the last 8 years. He avoids the ESPN and SPIKE TV cameramen and blinks at the camera flashes coming from the crowd. He approaches the mic to the sound of loud cheering. Brendan is hooting and hollering, our kids are shouting in childish tones and even Paddy is yelling loudly. Tommy looks directly at us. I can tell he is nervous. I send him a telepathic message and blow him a kiss, hoping he remembers everything I coached him on. He takes a deep breath and begins speaking. \"You guys know I don't like talking much,\" he rumbles in his deep voice, gripping the podium's sides. The response to this is instantaneous laughter. \"My wife,\" he continues, nodding his head in my direction, \"has been coaching me through this since the beginning. She tells me stuff like enunciate, don't scowl, try not to cuss.\" The laughter continues and I watch Tommy visibly relax. \"So I'm gonna make it quick. I just wanna say it's been a great time. You know, I came back from overseas, and it could've easily gone to hell for me. But fighting, it's gotten me through some tough times. For both me and my brother,\" Tommy pauses, collecting himself. Brendan raises his glass from our table. The two exchange small nods. \"You guys and my fans, you've been great. It's been a helluva ride. But it's time for the next thing, you know? I've got boys now and a little girl. So I'm thinking it's time to be a dad. But I'll always be around. I just won't be in the ring anymore.\" The applause begins, but it appears that Tommy is not finished. \"Nicole, thank you sweetheart, for being my anchor and putting up with my crap. I love you. And thanks to Pop, Brendan and Tess, and the rest of my family. Really, I couldn't have done it without you,\" he says. I feel my eyes begin to well up. I am aware my children are staring hard at me with looks of confusion. I bite back my emotion, resolving not to cry, despite the pride I feel. Tommy walks off the stage the same way he used to walk out of the ring, silently, with long strides. He beelines straight for me, pulling me to him and laying a kiss on my lips that makes me flush from the roots of my hair down to my toes. When he finally relinquishes me, the crowd is hooting and whistling. He does not seem to notice. \"How'd I do?\" he leans over to ask me as the waiters come around with dishes of food. The tables are all mixed up now. Eddie, Nick and Tina are dodging around people's ankles, playing with cousins and talking to fighters they have become familiar with over the past few years. Angela, Michael's wife, and Tess are chatting amicably about some book they have both read, Emily is talking about SAT prep courses with a friend of hers and Rosie is relating her fears about high school to her grandpa. Brendan and Mike banter back and forth, teasing like they do at every family gathering. \"You did amazing,\" I tell him, kissing him gently over our plates. \"Champagne?\" a waiter asks, brandishing a bottle. Tommy holds out his glass, but I decline. \"C'mon, sweetheart. I'm driving,\" he tells me, attempting to hand me his. \"I can't,\" I say simply. For a moment there is silence, and then Tommy begins laughing. Brendan and Mike have overheard the last part of our conversation. \"Seriously?\" Brendan laughs, looking at his nephews and niece across the room, \"Again?\" Our table waits for my response. \"Again,\" I grin in Tommy's direction, looking nowhere but him. \"Does ESPN just count on you taking maternity leave every 18 months?\" Mike jokes, pushing my shoulder lightly. \"Hey now, Tommy's part of the problem,\" Tess giggles, coming to my defense. \"Can't keep her off of me,\" Tommy shrugs. I shake my head at his joke, but he grabs my hand. \"That's great, sweetheart. Seriously,\" he whispers into my ear. I cannot stop smiling. The night whirls by and a carousel of faces approach our table, offering congratulations, recounting fights, taking pictures. Tommy shines, as usual, but refuses to walk more than three feet away from me. \"So,\" a reporter asks Tommy as the night wraps up, \"what's next for Tommy Conlon?\" Tommy looks at me over his microphone, with that crooked smile playing on his lips. \"Whatever I want,\" he tells him simply. \"Are you ready?\" I ask him later, Nick asleep in my arms. Tina is nodding off in Paddy's lap. Only Eddie is still buzzing with excitement. \"Yeah, Nicole,\" Tommy swoops Eddie up, \"Let's go home.\" Our little family exits together, ready for whatever comes next. ","Summary":" Author's Note: In my humble opinion, Warrior was one of the best and most underrated films in 2011."},{"Movie":"Fox and the Hound","Title":"The Fox and the Hunter","Author":"TangyO","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12480262","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: So technically, the original Fox and the Hound take place around 1967, and supposedly in the author's state of Pennsylvania. However, I'm moving the year of the movies setting to the year it released: 1981. In this prologue, Tod is around 1 year old, so it takes place a couple months after the end of the movie. Prologue May 1982 A cool wind blows through the forest. It's silent. All the animals are fast asleep, including the small family of red foxes, burrowed inside a log. There's four of them! A young male, a young female, and two newborns, one a boy, the other a girl. The young male is stirring in his sleep. He's dreaming of times past, many months before. He's dreaming of an unlikely friend, and their constant struggles of their nature. His friend is a hound dog, whose kind is bred to kill. To kill his kind. But he's different. He has no intention of harming his friend. They owe their lives to each other. After parting ways, they rarely come in contact, merely passing in the background of the other's life. They do know, however, the possibility that they meet again, would be a negative scenario. Copper is the hound's name. Tod is the fox's. They promised to be friends forever, even though they realize they will never go back to their childhood ways. There would be no playing in the pond. There would be no playing hide and seek. The reality is, Tod would be endangered by the hound's hunters, and Copper wouldn't act to save his friend a second time. This is how things are supposed to be. It's how nature intended it. One can't rebel against nature, Tod tried it. Nature punished him. Nature is the master of everything, like a hound dog to their master. The forest where the foxes reside, is a mile away from a nature reserve. One that would keep the couple safe. The Winter was, however, cruel to them. They had to leave their safety haven, to scavenge for food, for the arrival of their new born cubs were imminent. It would come to be a big mistake though, as leaving the reserve would expose them to the large group of regional hunters, who wanted nothing more than to kill every living thing in the area. … … A gunshot rang out, the forest echoing the explosion. \"Sounds like it's about half a mile away,\" said Tod. \"Whatever it is,\" his mate whispered, \"we have to make it back to the safety of the reserve\". The only problem with that plan, was that the gunshot came from the direction of the game reserve. \"Vixey, I'm gonna go check it out,\" said Tod. \"I'm going with you then,\" Vixey replied. Todd didn't want her to come with, but he didn't want to argue, \"Okay, fine. The kids should be safe here until we get back\". The pair of foxes ran swiftly toward the direction of the sound, making sure to not be seen by any of their adversaries. As they neared the site, they took to the trees, as they were more hidden and safe than the ground below. They could make out a couple voices from below. \"You see anything yet?\" \"Nope\". \"Blast it, I thought for sure we'd kill something by now\". \"Just keep searching. One of those dumb animals is bound to appear nearby.\" A couple minutes passed. The furry duo thought that they were safe, and dropped to the ground. Only to be met by the snarling growl of an angered hound dog! \"At last! Some prey for me to slay!\" snarled the predator. Tod and Vixey were both pinned to the forest floor. Escape was impossible. \"Unfortunately for you two, hounds never let their catch go!\" continued the hound. Tod had to figure out how to escape, and fast. \"Th- That's not true! I knew a hound who wasn't such a bully! As a matter of fact, we were friends!\". \"Hahaha,\" the beast laughed, \"that's impossible! No hound would hang out with a filthy animal like you! Who was this hound? Might as well have some fun with my prize!\". Todd whimpered, \"his name was… Copper\". This took the hound by surprise. \"Copper is the name of the best darn hunting dog in the region. Are you seriously making this up? You expect me to have pity on you, for saying you know a vicious hound?\". The hound paused. \"What does this hound look like, freak of nature?\". Trying his best to remember his old friends most prominent features, Tod replied, \"Well, he was yellowish I guess. With brown spots. Also, his collar was blue and he was kind of soft-spoken. His idol, Chief was— \" \"Okay, that's enough!\" Shouted the hound. \"Maybe you do know Copper. However, since this was so entertaining, I've decided to let you two go! But if we cross paths, I'll make sure to end your lives! \"Uhh… thanks,\" Vixey said. \"Yeah, that hound isn't too bright,\" whispered Tod. The pair ran back toward their log. When they arrived at their log however, there was nothing except smoke and fire. \"Oh no! No!\" Tod cried, \"the hunters got to our kids! This is all my fault!\" Vixey did her best to comfort him, putting her paw on Tod's back, \"No, it was my fault! I should have stayed with the kids while you surveyed the area!\" \"But then, you'd be dead too… I don't know which scenario is worse,\" Todd said. \"This is how mother nature treats us. There's nothing we can do Vixey.\" A tear streamed down Vixey's cheek. \"It's like how me and Copper lost connection. It wasn't the way nature wanted things\", he sobbed. \"But for once in my life, I was happy. And now, the world has taken that moment away…\".[Chapter 2] Part I: Troubled Beginnings Chapter 1: Scoot March 1983 Amos Slade was out on his rocking chair, holding his prized shotgun. He liked to remember the good old days, with him and his dog Chief hunting the wildlife. They were a happy couple. Until one day, he brought home a young Hound puppy and named it Copper. It's not that Copper was a bad dog, it's just that Copper got into a lot of trouble with a local tamed forest critter. Amos made it his goal, to put a bullet through that Critter, for causing Chief to get nearly killed by a train. Until one day, that critter taught him a valuable lesson. That critter, a fox, had a special bond with Copper, unbeknownst to Amos. It had saved him from a giant bear, and in return, Copper blocked Slade's shotgun, saving the fox from a bloody death. But the most important aspect of Amos' struggle with the fox: it taught him a valuable lesson: revenge is never the answer, and trying to enact revenge will just make even bigger problems. He still didn't realize the friendship that the two had. One day, he would though. In a way, Amos respected the fox. Widow Tweed, his neighbor, raised it. She and Amos are friends now. He promised widow that he would not shoot any guns on the property of their farms. After all, their farms were now in a newly developed Suburban subdivision. Half the forest disappeared. Guns were legal, but they would disturb the other families in their suburbia. The town seemed to be built in what seemed like a year! Widow Tweed lived to the right of Amos. To the left, his Son and Grandson would move into a brand-new home. They were both avid hunters, and were sometimes a challenge to Amos himself! They were city folk though, and rarely had the time to go on long hunting trips. Amos realized that it was about time to \"pass the torch\" to the next heir in the family line. About a year ago, Amos acquired another hound dog, however, this one was female. Her fur was mostly white, with small hints of gray. He decided to call her Daisy. Copper, on the other hand, had a certain affection for Daisy. They fell in love with each other, and produced two puppies, one of each gender. They were now about a month old. The girl, Amos named himself. Shadow. She was black as the night, and was extremely hard to find in the dark, so the name fit her perfectly! The male puppy, however, was going to be Amos' grandson, Alex's dog. Yesterday, the puppy got its name. Alex noticed that the puppy loved to scoot around on the floor, so he named him \"Scoot\". Scoot looked nothing like his sister. He was mostly white, with the odd brown spot here or there. One covered part of his face. \"Dad, do I really have to leave home and live with other people?\" Scoot asked. Copper replied, \"Kid, you are living next door! You aren't leaving! Calm down!\". \"Oh… okay,\" Scoot mumbled, embarrassedly. Just then, Amos and Alex appeared by the hounds. \"Alex, play with your puppy for a bit. I need to go talk to your father about something,\" explained the elder. Amos started to walk away. \"Hey, Grandpa, I have to go to school in an hour and I'll be gone for seven hours every day. Will Scoot be okay if I leave him here?\" asked Alex. \"Yeah, he should be fine!\" Amos shouted. Alex knelt on the ground, so he could play with his puppy. He started rubbing Scoot's belly \"You're going to be a great hunting dog, Scoot! I just know it!\" Alex exclaimed. Scoot smiled at the thought, I'm going to be the best hunting dog in the region! Just like my dad! Alex played some more with Scoot, running around the farm, and playing catch with the young hound. Soon enough, however, he had to leave for school. He loved playing with his dog, but college was also important. \"See ya later Scoot! Don't get in too much trouble, ok!\" Alex said, as he left the farm to go to school. Scoot watched as his owner's car drove away, before disappearing into the unknown. Great. Now what am I going to do? I'm going to be bored out of my mind! The weather was pleasant for most of the afternoon. Copper and Chief were busy with Amos, Daisy and Shadow were napping outside the barn, and Scoot did nothing but lay in his doghouse. He just stayed there for most the day. Then it started to rain. Scoot didn't like when it rained, because it made him feel lonely. Not only that, but he was deathly scared of thunderstorms. He crawled further into his doghouse, begging the rain to go away. This was the average day for Scoot, except sometimes it didn't rain. Every night, the Slade family would hold a bonfire in their yard. Infrequently, the Widow would join them. Alex would come home from school around this time. Copper, Chief, Daisy and both puppies would sit on the opposite side of the humans. Today, however, Scoot wasn't in the right mood. \"Hey son,\" Copper said to Scoot, \"how was your day?\". Scoot complained, \"It was so so SO boring! There was no one to play with, so I just laid in my doghouse the whole time. Then, it started to rain! Where were you? I NEEDED YOU!\". There was silence for a few seconds. \"Pipe it down kid, \"whispered Copper, \"I'm sorry you were all alone, but I had to go into town with my master. He gets paid to train puppies in hunting! The season starts in six months, which gives him plenty of time to recruit\". \"So, what does this have to do with me?\" replied Scoot. Copper laughed, \"You'll have some new buds soon! In a couple weeks or so— \" \"A couple WEEKS?\" Interrupted Scoot, \"I have to wait a couple weeks for somebody to play with? I want a friend NOW!\". The little puppy started bawling. Copper felt bad for his son. He was in almost the same situation when he was a pup. Well, sort of; Copper wouldn't let Scoot know his secret yet. \"I'll tell you what,\" started Copper, \"during the weekend, if our masters aren't around, I'll take you for a walk in the forest, and get you a head start on your huntin'. Sound good pal?\" \"I... I guess\", replied the baby hound. It really didn't make up for his time spent alone, but at least his dad was trying to make the situation better. Just then, a flash of light appeared in the sky above! \"A shooting star!\" exclaimed Alex's dad, Liam, \"Everybody make a wish!\" \"I wish for a great hunting season come fall!\" \"I wish for our little Scoot to be the best hunting hound there is!\" \"I wish to do good in college, while spending time with my puppy.\" \"I wish your family all the best, Amos.\" The dogs were making wishes too! \"I hope you show Alex and Amos how great you two puppies will be!\", said Chief. \"I just want my children to stay safe in their hunts\", said Daisy. \"I couldn't have said it better myself!\", exclaimed Copper. \"I hope our new friends like playing tag! I know we're huntin' dogs, but we gotta play too!\" Shadow stated. It was Scoot's turn next. He asked for the one thing he ever wanted, completely different from anyone else's wish, \"I… I… I\"—Scoot started to cry again—\"I want a friend.\" This took the other hounds by surprise. \"What do… you mean by a f… friend?\", curiously asked Chief. Scoot proudly continued, \"Easy. Someone to play with. Someone to run around with. Someone who doesn't care who I am or think I should be. A friend who will understand my problems, and in return I understand theirs. Someone I can count on, to help me in my time of need. In return, I help them. When I'm lonely or sad, that friend would be there to cheer me up!\" Scoot paused for a second, then finished his rambling, \"and THAT is the kind of friend I wish for.\" Copper was shocked. Surely, his son was having a problem with his loneliness. His rant however, made him feel a little uneasy. Finally, copper spoke, \"be careful what you wish for son. A friend that perfect would come with other complications.\" \"What do you mean\", scoot cracked, \"didn't you have friends growing up, Dad? Don't you understand where I'm coming from?\" Copper got up, and started to walk away. He responded as he was leaving, \"Sadly, I do.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 2: Be Careful What You Wish For Thursday, 3 days later Maybe being lonely isn't so bad. I mean, I have time to think to myself. But, I'd rather have a friend . Scoot was going insane. Not only was it raining, but it was pouring! And lightning out! It was the worst storm Scoot had ever seen! \"MAKE IT STOP!\" Scoot cried, \"I DON'T LIKE YOU RAIN!\". Suddenly, Scoot had the urge to just run out in the rain. He couldn't take the loneliness anymore. And so, he ran. He ran, far into the bushes on the edge of their property. At that moment, however, a lightning bolt extremely close startled him. He fell through the bushes, into the grass on the other side. He hit his head on the ground, and became unconscious. ... \"Hey, you alright?\" a young voice asked, \"you nearly drowned in that mud puddle!\". Scoot cracked open his eyes. The sun was finally out. In front of him was a bright orange young animal, wearing a small red hat over its head. \"No, I'm not!\" replied Scoot \"I have nothing to do, no one to talk to, and nowhere to be! I just want to be dead!\". \"Well, that's a bit… extreme kid. I never knew a hound dog could be so… fragile,\" said the orange creature. This peaked Scoot's interest, \"how do you know what I am? As a matter of fact, I don't even know what YOU are, KID!?\". The young animal responded, \"ha, first of all, it's technically 'kit' not 'kid'. Secondly, I'm a fox. Which leads into your third question: my dad showed me a hunting crew with dogs that look just like you! Only bigger!\". Scoot was getting annoyed at his little assailant, but he realized he had someone to talk to now, \"You're a fox!? My Dad and Uncle said that your kind are evil! That we are supposed to hunt you guys down!\". The little fox cub laughed, \"Dude, that is all true! Except for the ah… evil part. Don't know how that fits in but uh… you know. Can't break the prejudice out of someone!\" The fox paused, then continued, \"anyway, you looked like you needed some help, so I stuck around, despite being uh… unable to find the exact way home.\" \"So, you're lost,\" said Scoot. \"I'm not lost!\" shouted the cub, \"I just… don't remember the way back in the… quickest way… poss… ible?\" \"Face it kid, err… kit, you're lost! Lost lost lost LOST!\" mocked the puppy. This little fox was fun to tease. Yet, he wondered why his family thought his kind were evil. This little fella wasn't that bad! The fox kit started to get angry, \"Ok, so maybe I AM lost. Does me admitting that change the situation? No, it doesn't. So, maybe you could help me? You know, since I helped you. From your wallowing depression, it seems.\" Scoot thought for a moment. This fox kid wanted his help. But, he couldn't help the fox, because he was supposed to be his enemy. Or, wait a minute. Is this guy my 'enemy'? If he helped me I should return the favor. Someone I can count on, to help me in my time of need. In return, I help them. Wait a minute , thought Scoot, Can I turn this 'enemy' into my 'friend'? Scoot answered the kits plead, \"You know what, I'll help you. But in return, I want you to remember where we are right now. I want to see you every day over here. Deal?\". The fox was shocked. A little scared even. \"Wait, you want me to… hang out with… you?\" the fox questioned, \"You mean be like… friends?\" the kit paused. \"I mean, I'm d- d- down with that. It's just you shouldn't be so demeaning. My friends are gone for a while, so I guess having someone else to play with would be cool.\" Scoot replied, \"Yeah, I guess that was a little harsh. I'm just lonely, that's all.\" \"Well, as of now\" continues the cub, \"so am I. I don't know if my Dad would be ok with it. Ya know what? I don't really care! We should totally hang out!\" Scoot was ecstatic, he had a friend now and wouldn't be lonely anymore! \"Come on! Let's get you back home!\" Scoot said, \"Hey, wait a minute! What's your name? My name's Scoot.\" \"My name is Capper,\" said the young fox, \"but you can just call me Cap!\" \"Huh, that's funny, the puppy said, \"kinda near my dad's name!\" \"That's kinda cool I guess…,\" the fox returned. He wanted to change the subject though, \"Let's just go! My Dad will be worried sick!\". And so, the two new \"friends\" started to walk through the forest. They also had a nice chat. \"You got any brothers or sisters?\" asked the puppy, \"I have a sister. Her name is Shadow and she's completely black.\" \"Yeah, I have a sister,\" replied the fox, \"she's… like… the complete opposite of me.\" \"How so?\" asked the puppy. The fox continued, \"I'm orange and white. And she's white and orange. Get it? Like a complete color shift. I guess that's why my parents named her Lily\". \"Well that's kinds cool!\" exclaimed Scoot, \"It's like… her appearance is different, but she's still the same cause she's a fox!\" \"Yeah!\" shouted the fox, \"It's kinda like us! We are different species, yet we can talk and figure out our differences and similarities! Gee, having you as a friend is kind of cool!\" \"You too!\" said Scoot. The dubious duo continued walking. \"Hey! I think I know my way back from here!\" Cap said. \"Cool! I'll see you tomorrow then, friend ,\" Scoot said back. The two smiled at each other, then walked their separate ways. ... At the bonfire, Copper could not figure out why his son was so happy. He wanted to find out, though. \"Scoot\". \"Yeah dad?\" \"Come over to the side of the barn, I wanna talk to you\". Scoot obliged, and they both went to the side of the barn, away from everyone else. \"Alright, so what's going on?\" asked Copper. \"I got a friend dad! I wasn't lonely today!\" said Scoot, happily. \"Well I'm happy for you son! Say, who is this 'friend' of yours?\" questioned the father. \"Uhm… he's different from us dad. But I hurt myself in the grass behind the bush and he rescued me.\" \"So, it's a forest animal? A game animal?\" \"Yeah, I guess, but he was really nice to me. He looks to be about my age too.\" \"Ahh, I see,\" copper sighed, \"look son, I'm alright with you having forest friends! Just don't bring them near the house.\" \"Why?\" asked Scoot, \"are they going to be dangerous?\" Copper thought for a moment on how he should answer his question, \"No, our masters are a danger to them. We are supposed to hunt them, remember?\". \"You mean, we k- kill them?\" asked Scoot, bewildered. \"Yes, but you don't have to\", Copper reassured his son. He had more to add though, \"look, Scoot. I had a friend from the forest too. I mean, he wasn't raised in the forest, but he was raised next door. His name was Tod, and when we were kids, we would play hide and seek and splash in the pond next to the Widow's house.\" \"Really?!\" questioned the puppy. Copper continued, \"eventually, it was time to go hunting, and I never said goodbye. But then, we changed. The next Spring, I came back a hunting dog. But I still didn't want to hurt my friend. He came over to talk one night, and Chief went berserk. My master, Amos you know, wanted so hard to kill my friend. He thought he was there to steal the chickens.\" \"But he was really just wanting to see you. Right dad?\" \"Right son!\" Copper continued, I found him hiding under a rock, and told him I don't 'wanna see him get killed'. So I left, and he ran up the mountain, toward those train tracks over there\". Copper pointed to the bridge in the distance, now including rails on the sides. He continued, \"Chief chased him onto the track, a train came, and my friend Tod ducked under the train. Chief however, you know, broke his leg.\" \"So THAT'S why Chief's leg is so messed up!\" exclaimed Scoot. \"Precisely\", the older hound continued, \"I told Tod that if I ever saw him again, I would kill him. His owner found him, my master tried to shoot him at her house. So, she took him to the game reserve, where he couldn't be hunted. He found love, and started a new life.\" \"Well, I guess that's not so bad, right?\" asked the puppy. \"No! It gets worse! Me and Amos snuck into the game reserve with traps, to kill Tod. It just so happened that we ran into a bear, Tod killed it at a waterfall, and we tracked him down.\" \"Wait, dad, did you kill your friend Tod?\" interrupted Scoot. \"Just wait kid\", replied Copper, before continuing his long tale, \"I watched on the bank, as I watched my friend struggling to get up on the lake shore. I didn't attack him. I whispered his name, and he looked over to me. Then, my owner pulled the shotgun out. I knew what needed to be done.\" \"YOU LET AMOS KILL YOUR FRIEND!?\" screamed the puppy. \"Scoot quiet down! I never told anyone this!\" copper yelled at his son. Scoot calmed down, and Copper finished his story, \"No Scoot, I jumped the gun. I protected him. I realized what a jerk I've been, and how our Nature set to divide us. I rebelled. Amos realized that, and he and I left. Me and Tod haven't talked since then, but I see him and his mate overlooking us on the hill to the North every once and awhile. I just stay quiet. It's better that way.\" A single tear dropper from Copper's eye. \"So,\" Scoot replied, \"you are the meanest hunting dog around, but you have a secret relationship with a forest critter. I never thought you'd be that cool dad.\" \"Yeah son,\" said Copper, \"pretty cool. Anyways, who is this friend of yours?\". \"Oh,\" Scoot said, \"he's a fox named Cap, or Capper. Sounds like your name, right? He has this cool little red hat he wears.\" This got Copper a little worried, \"your friend is a fox? That's interesting. Keep him away from Chief! Otherwise, don't tell anyone we had this conversation.\" Copper paused. \"However, I wanna meet this friend of yours. Saturday sound ok?\" \"As… long as you don't hurt him,\" scoot sighed. \"I promise Scoot, I won't hurt a friend of yours!\" Copper had a sneaking suspicion: my kid, met a fox. Could it be? Copper sighed, maybe we will meet again old friend.[Chapter 4] Chapter 3: Breaking the Rules Friday \"Bye Scoot! See you tonight!\" Alex called. Scoot made a happy bark, and ran towards the field, where he met Cap. Alright, it's a new day! Time to go play! Scoot thought. I wonder when that kid will be here? Scoot waited for a couple seconds in the field. Is he going to ditch me? He didn't have to wait long for his answer, as the Fox kit popped out of the bushes! \"BOO!\" Cap shouted. Scoot stumbled back and fell, surprised by the fox's sneak \"attack\". \"Did I scare yah?\" jeered the orange animal. \"Kinda,\" Scoot admitted, but I'm not afraid to admit it! Like you when you were lost— \" \"OH, cut it out already! It was a stupid situation!\" After a couple seconds of silence, Scoot continued. \"So, what do you want to do, friend? \" asked the puppy, \"we could play tag, hide and seek, I got a ball that we can throw around a bit. Whatever you wanna do, ya know?\" \"Well, there's only two of us\" replied the fox, \"so tag would be dumb, unless you could get your sister. Hide and seek could work, or tossing things around too.\" \"Ok, so let's play hide and seek then!\" exclaimed Scoot, \"you hide, and I'll count!\" \"Alright pal, but I'm really good at this game! I'm warning ya!\" Cap said. \"You have too much pride, fox! We'll see who's victorious. Now go hide!\" Scoot started to count, \"I… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6… 7… 8… 9… TEN! Ready or not, here I come!\" The young hound started his hunt. He looked in the bushes first. Nope, not there, he thought. He checked by the pond. This area is clear, where could that little cub be? He continued searching for what seemed like an hour. \"Okay, I give up\" the hound confessed, \"you win! Now, where the heck is you?\" \"Above your head the whole time!\" a faint voice called out. \"Huh\" Scoot questioned. Then he looked up, to see his new friend smiling, full of glee, happy he outfoxed the hound. \"That's not fair! I can't climb trees!\" shouted Scoot. \"Really?!\" asked the fox, \"I didn't know you couldn't climb.\" \"Doesn't that give you an unfair advantage?\" asked Scoot, \"I can't really see you if I can't climb trees!\" \"Kid, all you had to do was look up!\" laughed Cap, \"I was watching you the whole time.\" Scoot felt a little embarrassed. So, foxes can climb trees easily? Good for them I guess. They need to evade hunters and hounds somehow. Scoot thought for a moment. Hey! What if Cap showed me how to climb trees, and I can show him tricks that hunting dogs use, in case he gets in trouble some day! \"Yoh, Cap. Any way you can show me how to climb a tree?\" Scoot asked his friend. \"Why? Can you even climb being a dog?\" the fox asked. \"It's worth a shot, isn't it?\" the puppy replied. Cap responded, \"why would I show a future killing machine how to climb trees? It's a tactic we fox use to evade you!\" \"Because,\" Scoot said, \"I can show you tricks that hounds use, in case you are ever in danger! And you called me a future killing machine? I'm not going to hurt you, we're friends, remember?\" \"Yeah about that,\" the fox replied, \"I don't know if I can trust you in the future, Scoot. I know some things that you don't, about foxes and hounds. My dad told me about his childhood, and it didn't work out for him, being friends with a hound. That's why we live in the forest here, to stay away from your kind.\" Cap paused. \"We are breaking the rules of our nature, you know that, right? I'm just saying, we need to be cautious of each other, as we are natural enemies.\" Scoot pondered on Cap's speech: it's true, we are supposed to be enemies, but we're friends! Why does that have to change? I don't care about what the world wonts, I'm happy right now with my buddy Capper! \"You're right,\" the hound stated, \"we are supposed to be enemies. But, if we can help each other overcome our natural boundaries, then we don't need to obey our mother nature. I want to help you, Cap, so let me show you some hound tricks, if you need to escape in the future. I know some now, but I can show you more when I learn them in the future!\" The fox sighed, \"Urgh… you are persistent. Fine, that's awfully nice of you, Scoot. You make me think that a hound friend might not be so bad after all\". \"And now I know that you foxes aren't nasty vermin!\" scoot said, \"it's just what my family said, and I choose to ignore it! Now, come on! I'll show you in detail how we track game!\" Cap agreed, maybe this won't be so bad, he thought, maybe he can know my secret, if he's trying to help me out. After all, poor kid's lonely as sin, doesn't seem like he wants to hurt me. As the next few hours passed, Scoot showed Capper all that he knew of his hunting techniques. Also, yes, Cap taught Scoot how to climb trees. Sort of. \"So yeah,\" Scoot said, \"the main goal is to force the hounds to lose your scent! Once you accomplish that, then they can't track you as easily… and you can escape!\" \"Well that's helpful Scoot,\" his furry orange friend replied, \"you showed me a lot today. I definitely feel a lot safer now! Will all these tricks work on all hunting dogs?\" \"Yeah, but there are a few exceptions though, like my dad, who never loses track of his prey.\" Cap had a worried look on his face after that last remark. Scoot seemed to notice, \"but don't worry!\" he continued, \"my dad would never track someone like you! In fact, he wants to meet you!\" \"Wait… WHY would your dad of all things, want to meet ME?\" asked Cap, \"if he is a full-blown killing machine, he wouldn't spare anything!\" \"Cap, it's ok!\" Scoot reassured his friend, \"my dad said I could play with you, we just have to be safe behind the brush!\" \"That's strange, I wonder why?\" Cap replied. \"He had a tamed friend from the forest when he was little!\" Scoot said. That statement hit Cap like a stack of bricks, there's something SUPER fishy here, he thought . There was silence for a few seconds. \"Scoot,\" Cap broke the ice, \"do you live at that farm between that other farm and new house?\". \"Yes, why?\" \"Ok, I'm going to tell you a secret , don't tell anyone, not even your dad, ok?\" \"I promise\". \"Good,\" the fox continued, \"Cap is an alias, it's not my real name… well, it's based off my real name.\" \"Really?\" Scoot questioned. \"When I was real little, I found a truck on the side of the road that lost a shipment of hats. There were many colors there. Anyways, I stole this red one\". \"How is that important?\" Scoot asked. \"Well, you see, Cap is another name for a hat. So, I based my nickname off that. Also, what kind of hunter would shoot an animal with a cute little hat?\" \"Yeah, I get it now, the hat protects you in a way, right\"? \"Exactly,\" Capper continued, \"and I said my full name was Capper. But before I continue, you can't tell this to anyone , ok? \"I said I promise, Cap.\" \"Ok,\" the fox sighed, \"I'm named after an old friend of my father's. Well, my real name at least. This friend saved his life, and disobeyed his hunter. And… if your father told you anything, you know where I'm going with this, right? \"I don't know, maybe. I gotta think about it\". \"You won't have to ponder about it Scoot, I'm sharing this secret with you. Your dad told you about a tamed forest friend! Did he say what kind of forest friend he had?\" \"Uhm\" Scoot said, \"no, but he told me his name. He went into detail about why he lost his friend. Where are you going with this anyway?\" \"Ok, Scoot, I'll lay the bait,\" the fox continued, \"recognize these words or names? Train. Bridge. Chief. Copper. Tod. Slade. Widow. Bear.\" \"I recognize those words from the story, but I'm confused.\" \"Alright, let's continue,\" Cap continued, \"the animal that your dad was friends with was a fox.\" \"How do you know?\" Scoot asked, confused. \"A little slow ehh?\" the fox teased, \"alright, we're at the end here.\" Cap paused, and looked his friend right in the eyes. \"Your dad's name is Copper.\" \"How do you know that?\" Scoot asked, surprised. \"Let's piece all the information together, of the story,\" Capper continued, \"I'm named after an old friend of my father's. This friend saved his life, and disobeyed his hunter. The animal that your dad was friends with was a fox. I'm a fox. Get it?\" \"I… don't really know? H- how do you know what my dad said Cap, you're scaring me.\" \"I'll finish then,\" Cap continued. \"Your dad's name is Copper, and he's a hound dog, with a mentor named Chief, right?\" \"Yeah… and you know this…\" \"Ok, Chief got hit by a train because your dad's friend, an animal, ran onto the tracks.\" \"Mmm hmm.\" Scoot remembered his dad's words from the previous night: Chief chased him onto the track, a train came, and my friend Tod ducked under the train. Chief however, you know, broke his leg. An evil smirk came across Cap's face, revealing his sharp teeth. \"So, your dad's friend's name is Tod.\" \"Wait a second Cap…I'm … starting to piece it together, give me a moment.\" \"We don't have time,\" cap went on, \"but here's the end of the little story kid.\" Cap paused, then continued, \"my father's name is Tod.\" \"NO WAY!\" shouted Scoot. Tod is his dad's name, my dad had a friend named Tod. Cap continued, \"And let's summarize everything from the story, ok? I'm named after an old friend of my father's. This friend saved his life, was a hound, and disobeyed his hunter, Slade. This friend blocked his friend Tod, a fox, from being shot. Your dad's name is Copper.\" Then it clicked. \"No way! You… you are…,\" Scoot mumbled. Cap got close to Scoot's ear. \"My name is Copper\".[Chapter 5] A/N: Even though Cap's name is Copper, he will still be referred to as Cap in writing, as not to be confused with Copper the hound dog. X25Z56: \"has the fire already happened when Scoot and Cap met?\" Yeah, the main story takes place the year after the prologue. Tod's first children were killed, you'll find out more in part 2 (which is a while away, but I'm starting to write it. I won't post a new chapter until I'm at least five ahead). Chapter 4: Tricks and Traps Friday, Bonfire My dad and Copper's dad know each other. He knew a lot about the story, but I wanna verify it somehow. But, I promised him I wouldn't tell my dad. \"Hey sport! How was your day with Cap?\" Copper asked. \"Uhm… it was cool. We showed each other some tricks.\" \"Like what?\" \"Well,\" Scoot felt a little uneasy, \"I showed him how to avoid hounds and hunters, and he showed me how to climb trees!\" \"Well that's nice,\" Copper said, \"you seem like your bein' a pretty good friend then.\" \"I also told him that you don't lose your prey, but you would be forgiving to him,\" Scoot continued. \"You did?\" asked Copper, startled, \"I won't try to kill him Scoot, but if he is out in the open when we're hunting, then he's fair game.\" \"Well,\" interrupted Scoot, \"I know something you don't dad. So, I know you won't ever touch him. Didn't you want to meet him tomorrow?\" \"Yeah, I did\". Copper paused. \"You have a secret? I won't ask Scoot, but if it's important let me know.\" \"I promised I wouldn't tell anybody, dad.\" \"And that's ok, loyalty is a great thing son. I wish I was more like you when I was younger.\" Uhm, dad. You saved Cap's father. Isn't that pretty loyal? \"Dad\" Scoot asked, \"what kind of an animal was your friend Tod?\" \"Why does that matter? He was a fox, son\" Copper replied. Well I guess that confirms it then. Copper er… Cap really is Tod's son! \"Look kid,\" Copper continued, \"you boys just have to stay out of trouble! Don't worry, Cap will be safe if he doesn't come over here! We hunt animals, remember. It's in our blood, and you can't change that!\" \"I know dad, I just want to make sure I don't… hurt… him\". \"I know son. Believe me, I know.\" \"I understand completely, dad. Honest.\" \"Good,\" said Copper. \"get some sleep. Alex will be home tomorrow, since it's the weekend.\" \"Ok, goodnight dad!\" The two of them were so preoccupied, they didn't notice two of the hunters walking toward the bushes, with hands full of bear traps. Liam and Alex Slade were walking through the brush. \"So, you think we might catch something, dad?\" asked Alex. He was holding another trap. \"Something is bound to come over here, Alex,\" said Liam, \"I want to catch something, then you can show it to Scoots. When all is said, and done, shoot whatever is in the trap, and take the hide to the shed\". \"And if we don't catch anything dad—\" \"Just give it time! Hunters need to be patient!\" They set the traps on the edge of the forest. This is kind of cruel, Alex thought, I'll give whatever gets trapped a swift death, they don't deserve the pain. I just gotta show Scoot how we use these traps, then I'll never have to use them again. Alex was a hunter, but he was not likened to use inhumane tactics to kill game. Little did he know, his puppy got along with one of them. A/N: Short chapter, but the next one is a lot longer! Stay tuned![Chapter 6] Chapter 5: The Hunter Saturday The field behind the Slade Residence \"So yeah,\" said Scoot, \"Our parents know each other, based on the story.\" Cap started to talk, \"yeah, seems obvious now, doesn't it! Too bad they probably won't ever see eye-to-eye.\" \"Aren't they friends though, Copper? I mean… Cap. I'm still calling you Cap, that would be confusing anyway.\" Cap smiled, which quickly turned into a frown. \"They aren't friends anymore. \" \"WHAT?!\" shouted Scoot, \"my dad called him a FRIEND in his story, why can't they still be friends?\" \"Because of our nature, buddy. They can't meet again, and if the hunters are with your Dad, then it's over,\" Cap stated, \"the closest my dad gets to seeing his friend, is climbing on those rocks on the North, with Vixey, my Mom. He likes to check up on how his old friend is doing. He'd rather Copper didn't know he was there.\" \"That makes sense I guess\", Scoot replied, \"Chief would tear him apart.\" \"Yeah, it's kind of sad,\" continued Cap, \"but that's how the world goes I suppose. Your dad probably hasn't seen mine for years , way before we were born\". \"That's not true!\" interrupted Scoot, \"my dad told me he sees Todd when he watches over us, but he remains silent!\" \"Well that's very unusual Scoot,\" the fox was now kicking a ball around that Scoot brought, \"maybe they can be friends again, but I wouldn't bet on it.\" Cap was now walking toward the forest, \"Still, it's very odd how you are left with the same problem as your father. When we grow up, and situations arise, will you kill me? Or will you let me go?\" \"Why would I want to kill you?\" asked Scoot, surprised, \"I don't care about someone like Chief, who would chase a poor animal onto train tracks. There's no one in my family who I care about, that is even that vicious .\" \"Yeah, but what about your sister ?\" \"My… sister?\" \"Yeah, she doesn't know we're friends , Scoot. What if she were to attack me, and I defended myself? That would probably turn you against me.\" Scoot thought for a minute. I should tell Shadow about Cap. She's usually good about keeping secrets. \"I can tell my sister about you,\" Scoot responded, \"I think she'll understand. \"That might be ok Scoot. But let me make myself clear,\" Cap continued, \"our parents can never meet again. Ever. They can't know about us; that their sons are playing together. It will just cause problems. This right here, is between you and me . Comprende?\" \"I understand,\" said Scoot, \"the secret children of the fox and hound won't ever be revealed!\" \"Good, anyway, how far can you kick this ball?\" Cap challenged. Scoot walked back a couple meters, before sprinting head first into the ball. It flew a good 15 meters, before landing next to a tree. \"Not too bad, kid,\" Cap said, as he started walking toward the ball, \"now, see how far I—\" The sound of a metal object snapping shut was heard. Cap screamed. Scoot saw in horror, as his friend was caught in a bear trap. \"OH, MY GOSH!\" scoot screamed, \"ARE YOU OK\"? \"MY TAIL IS CAUGHT IN THIS TRAP, DO YOU THINK?\" \"I'm going to call for help! AWOOOOOOOOOH!\" Scoot howled. \"No, you idiot!\" Cap snapped, \"don't call your hunters, they probably set this trap and want to kill me.\" \"Oh no! You're right!\" Scoot cried, \"what have I done? Alex probably heard me!\" \"Well now I'll just wait patiently for dear Death, thanks for the help pal!\" \"Hey, I don't wanna see you get killed, Cap! I'll think of something\". \"If that something doesn't involve attacking your hunters, then it might as well not be thought of! I'm surprised this thing missed any bones!\" Shouting could be heard in the distance. Well, \"Cap whined,\" looks like our friendship lasted a whole three days! That's two less days then our parents being childhood friends. At least we set a record!\" \"Just… Chill out Cap…\" \"I am going to die… Scoot.\" \"Maybe not\". \"You think they'll feel sorry for me? There's not a fox's chance in heck!\" \"Maybe they will.\" \"Or maybe, they'll be nice, and shoot me dead. That would be quick and painless.\" \"I DON'T WANT THEM TO KILL YOU CAP!\" Scoot yelled, \"Don't you get it?\" \"You seem to be doing quite the contrary, friend. We all make stupid mistakes, it's ok,\" Cap paused, \"but if I'm dead, I can't forgive you for this.\" Scoot pondered, how can I show Alex I don't want him to kill Cap? Scoot thought for his friend's life. Then, the lightbulb went off in his head. I got it! I know how to save Copper! \"SCOOT! Where are you!\" It was Alex's voice. Here it goes, Scoot thought . Alex came through the bush. \"There you are little guy!\" he said, \"what are you doing out here by yourself—\" Alex noticed the fox cub in the trap. \"You found some game? Good job boy!\" Cap stared in horror, as Alex drew out his shotgun. \"Poor little guy,\" Alex cooed, \"you don't deserve this. \"Alright Scoot, you hunt them down, then we kill 'em. Like this.\" Alex cocked his shotgun. Now's my chance ! thought Scoot. He ran over to Cap, and sat right next to him. The fox was bewildered by this action, \"what are you doing dork?\" Cap whined, \"the shell spread will hit you too!\" \"Uhm, Scoot\" Alex called, \"you should probably back away!\" Scoot stayed firm. \"Come on Scoot, I don't want to shoot you too! I mean, I'm not going to… but, come here boy!\" Alex whistled. And yet, Scoot remained next to Cap. He realized he was getting nowhere though. So, he executed his master plan: He licked Cap on the cheek. \"EWW!\" the fox screamed, \"I've been licked by a hound! Just end the torture already, please dear lord!\" Scoot remained Calm. Alex's expression changed, from being full of anger, to one of understanding. He lowered his shotgun. Alex couldn't believe it! His hound was stopping him from shooting a baby fox! Why would he do that? Alex remained silent, frozen even. He finally trembled, after a good minute, \"Is this little guy your… friend, Scoot?\" Scoot whined. It worked! Scoot thought. \"Is this where you've been the past few days?\" Alex continued, \"playing with a fox, while I was at school?\" He had a sad expression on his face. \"That's ok, pal. I don't really want to hurt him! He's a baby!\" Scoot walked by his friends caught tail, and whined. \"I'll get him unstuck, buddy, \"Alex promised Scoot, \"this is kind of weird though, but in a way, kinda cool.\" Alex released the trap holding Cap. He then went around the perimeter, disarming all the other traps from the previous night. Cap remained still. \"I'm…\" he trembled, \"I'm… not… DEAD! I'm not dead! Thanks Scoot! I forgive you… I guess.\" \"Told ya I didn't wanna see you get killed!\" the hound cheerfully cried, \"We're friends remember!\" \"Yeah…\" Cap happily sighed. \"Hey, Cap, you wanna see if my master will play ball with us?\" asked Scoot, \"maybe he will, since he knows we're friends now?\" He retrieved his ball, and brought it to Alex. \"I don't know Scoot… I'm still recovering from a near death experience you know,\" replied Cap. Alex grabbed the tennis ball from scoot. \"You wanna play fetch boy?\" he questioned. Then, he turned to Cap. \"I bet you want to play too, don't ya little guy?\" he motioned to Cap, \"come here, fella, I won't hurt you.\" He tossed the ball in the air, which landed right next to Cap. Cap stood frozen for a second, but realized that it might serve him better to go along with Alex. So, he ran towards the ball, and kicked it back to Alex. \"Your friend's kind of cute, Scoot\" Alex said to his puppy, \"doesn't seem like any of the other dumb foxes I've hunted. He seems to feel safe with you\". Alex reconsidered the situation he was in, so my puppy is friends with a fox. It's kind of nice. I never knew these species could get along so well. At least he has someone to play with while I'm in school, and he's not moping around. Yep, I'll let the kit live. \"See Cap!\" scoot exclaimed, \"Alex really likes you!\" \"You sure he likes me and not my coat ?\" Retorted Cap. \"He didn't shoot you, so that's a start\". \"I guess so, Scoot. I guess so.\" Alex continued playing with the two strange friends. As the hour passed, Cap started warming up to Alex. He even let him get close enough to pet! Of course, he was startled by the friendly gesture, but he understood that Alex meant no harm. \"Alright Scoot,\" Alex called, \"I'm gonna go now! Be careful with your friend!\" He smiled at Cap. He could have sworn that the fox kit smirked at him, but he dismissed the idea. \"Oh, that's right! I just remembered something!\" Shouted Scoot, \"my dad was going to meet you today!\" \"Oh yeah, Joy! Dad's best friend who nearly killed him, is meeting me. How charming.\" \"Relax, kit! Laughed Scoot, \"he's not gonna hurt you! Maybe he wants to just make sure we're safe!\" It was now 3 PM. No one was home, except for the hounds. All the humans went into town, for groceries. They would be gone for a couple hours. The Kit and Pup continued to play, and Scoot was able to make it half way up a tree finally! \"See! You're doing it! Cap cheered, \"Keep practicing!\" Scoot found himself stuck on the tree. Trying to dislodge himself, he unfortunately fell backwards, and hit the ground on his back. Cap was rolling on the forest floor laughing, \"Dude, you need to make a safer… landing! Hahahahaha!\" he giggled. Just then, another voice was heard, \"Scoot! You back here son?\" It was Copper. \"Oh yeah, of course you are! It's the perfect place to play! It's where I met Tod!\" Cap looked at Scoot. \"Moment of truth, right pal?\" \"Yeah,\" replied the hound, \"here we go buddy!\" Copper came out of the brush, and found the two animals. He paused for a second, staring at Scoot, then at Cap, then at Scoot again. \"So, you must be Cap, right?\" the older hound asked the fox. \"Yeah, and you must be Scoot's father, Copper!\" replied Cap. \"Right you are kiddo!\" Copper continued, \"you guys been getting along well? Why is Scoot on the ground on his back?\" \"I'm showing the mutt how to climb trees,\" Capper smirked, \"he can make it half way, but he's a dog so you figure that out .\" Copper smiled, this kid has an attitude, not unlike another fox I know, he thought . Copper started again, \"so Scoot told me he's teaching you all our secret hunting techniques. You know that won't stop me, right?\" Copper's tone was serious now, \"you gotta watch it kid. I may be a furry teddy bear now, but on the hunt, I don't. Have. A. Choice\". \"I understand Mr. Copper,\" Cap replied, \"you are the best hunting dog in the region, Scoot told me. It's obvious you can't be lenient at the same time\". Copper reflected on Cap's statement, \"What if I'm just telling you this to scare you though? What if I don't want you to get hurt? Heck, I saved a fox once!\" Cap thought, oh boy, here we go. You gonna tell me the story about how you almost killed dad? But you felt sorry for the sap, since he was broken from saving your sorry life? Cap said, \"Yeah, I know. Scoot told me.\" Copper smiled, \"Did he? Or did you know this before? I'm curious Cap, what do you know about us hounds, that you don't want to tell me? You wanna trade secrets? We can do that\". Oh, heck! Cap thought, he's got me cornered, but I'm not giving in. Scoot interrupted, \"Uhh, dad, he doesn't know anything! Honest. Copper was getting frustrated on the inside. I just want to know, cap, he thought, are you connected to Tod? He realized he was getting nowhere, but that was ok. The kids could keep their secret . He surrendered, \"fine, you can keep your secret. I just want to help though, understand that. No one else in our family would be so kind to game animals. You should know that, Cap.\" But then, Copper thought of a great comeback. \"Oh, and Cap\", he asked, \"did Scoot also tell you about the story I told him? About my old forest friend\". \"Uhh, yeah, he did, \"Cap trembled a reply. I know you're lying, you little pest! But you're so damn hardheaded, it's like extracting information through a brick wall. Copper continued, \"so Tod, the Fox in the story. Do you think that we're still friends? Despite not keeping in contact? I wanna know your opinion on this, Cap. You know, from a fox's perspective.\" Of course, if this kid is related to Tod, and Tod told him about me, this will be Tod's answer. \"I… I don't think so sir.\" Copper was puzzled, while Cap continued, \"I think nature forced you to split apart, and you can't really fight nature.\" Copper smirked, damn this kid is smart. \"What are you doing messing with a hound puppy then?\" \"Oh\", Cap said, \"Scoot? He was lonely, and wanted a friend. My friends are away for a couple days, so I figured why not.\" Cap paused, then continued, \"I feel pretty safe here actually. Even Scoot's master, Alex, seems to allow our friendship.\" I didn't know that before! Copper thought, the hunter allows the Hound to play with the game? Boy… times are changing. If only Amos was as forgiving back then… \"You wanna know what that fox, Tod told me when we were younger?\" Copper asked, but didn't expect a reply, \"he said we will always be friends forever, and I agreed. You think a statement like that can stand the test of time?\" Cap reflected on Copper's speech, \"Uhh, I don't know Mr. Copper, time is just another force of nature, which is once again, unbeatable.\" Copper sighed, he was getting nowhere, \"Scoot leave us for a minute, I won't hurt him. Me and Cap need a one-to-one, ok?\" \"Uhh yeah,\" Scoot obliged, \"be nice though.\" \"I will son. He's your friend.\" Scoot left the full-blown hound, and the little fox. There's no escaping this, thought Cap, secrets must come out. But I can't let them meet again! \"Ok,\" copper started, \"Tell me about your parents. Where do they come from? Not their names, you won't reveal that, I know. You have siblings? How is your family?\" Cap bravely said, \"My parents are fine, they have been through a lot. My dad grew up at some old lady's home, my Mom grew up in the forest, being hunted the first three months of her life. They lost two children to hunter's a year ago. I have one sister, and she is white and orange, unlike how I'm orange and white.\" So, Tod's been through hell, Copper felt saddened , poor fox. First, he loses me, then loses his kids. Awful. I'm gonna tell the kid I know his secret. Here goes nothing , thought Copper, \"I know you are Tod's son, Cap. The Old lady part gave it away.\" uh oh, can't wiggle out of this one, thought Cap. \"Ok, you got me,\" he sighed in defeat, \"I am Tod's son. But you must understand sir, you can't meet again. Dad thinks you guys can't be friends anymore. I'm sorry.\" Copper pouted at the Kit's response. Copper said, \"I know Cap, I know. But at least, now we're being real with each other.\" \"Yeah, Copper, bein' real..\" What did I just say?! Copper started to walk away, but he left Cap one last note, \"Oh, and Cap. I won't hunt you down. I don't want to hurt a child of a friend. You're safe with me.\" The hound left. It was getting later in the afternoon, and Tod wanted Cap home earlier, so he left too. I'll keep the secret from dad, he can't know I've been hanging out with hounds. A/N: Still a bit more exposition to go, but part 1 is almost finished![Chapter 7] Chapter 6: Generational Conflict Saturday, Afternoon Slade Residence Alex was still pondering what he saw that day, Scoot is friends with a fox. We are supposed to kill foxes. That poor kit doesn't understand that he is playing with the enemy. Alex then thought positively, on the other hand, Scoot has never been happier! I can't play with him while he's at school, so maybe his little fox buddy is a blessing… regardless, I'm going to be keeping an eye on them. Just then, Amos Slade sat down next to Alex, exhausted after a long day of work. Alex liked talking to his grandfather more than his father. Liam never hurt Alex, however, ever since Alex's mom died, he was a frequent alcohol abuser. Amos was crazy, but he never stooped that low. \"Is something on your mind, kid?\", asked Amos. He noticed Alex's blank expression. \"Nah, I'm fine!\" replied his grandson.\" Alex wanted to ask Amos about his puppy's fox friend, but he wanted to be discreet about it. \"Grandpa, I have a question\". \"Go on, kid\". Alright, alex thought, how do I ask this, without giving it away. \"So, hounds hunt animals right, grandpa?\" \"Alex, don't play dumb with me,\" Amos replied. \"I know, but it leads into another question\", Alex continued, \"have you ever seen a hound not kill a game animal? Like, tried to not kill it?\" Amos was wrapped in his thoughts, yes, I have seen this before. \" Yes, Alex I have seen a hound dog save an animal before.\" Amos paused, \"In fact, it was Copper who wouldn't attack a fox.\" Woah, Alex thought, so Copper and his puppy seem to be kind to certain animals. I wonder why that is? \"Tell me, grandfather. Why did Copper not attack the fox?\" \"You really want to hear this boy?\" \"Yeah!\" \"Copper stopped me from killing a fox in the game reserve,\" Amos said, \"Now, this fox was weak on the bank of a lake, and couldn't escape. So, for some confounded reason, Copper stepped between that rodent and my shotgun, and I was unable to kill it.\" Amos sighed, \"that fox is the reason why Chief's leg is broke. He chased it onto that there railroad bridge! It belonged to tha Widow next store, and it wouldn't stop coming over to ma yard. I think it was trying to get ma chickens!\" \"So,\" alex replied, \"you hunted, illegally, in the game reserve, to get revenge on a little animal? Seems kind of idiotic, if you think about it.\" \"I HAD A GOOD REASON TO DO IT, ALEX!\" Amos shouted, \"THAT DARN FOX DIDN'T DESERVE TO LIVE!\" Amos calmed down, \"But I realized, that I may have gone too far, Alex. So, I have a respect for that critter, Tod, who made me realize that revenge just got me into trouble. For some reason, that fox saved Copper and me from a bear. Maybe Copper realized that it saved his life.\" The two of them stared in silence. \"Uhm, grandpa,\" Alex spoke, \"can I tell you a secret, if you tell me something?\" \"I'll keep yer secret kid,\" replied Amos, \"what's up?\" \"Do you think that maybe Copper saved that fox; I think you said Tod was his name; because they were friends?\" \"NONSENSE!\", amos laughed, \"A fox and a hound being friends? Are pigs flying ma boy? HAHahaha.\" \"I'm serious.\" \"Yer' crazy, Alex.\" Alex sighed, time to reveal the weird in the world. \" Scoot has been lonely while I was gone, and there is no one here when I'm at school, so he's bored.\" \"And what does this have to do with yer dog, sonny?\" \"Well I don't know if you'll believe this, but Scoot made a friend with a fox—\" \"THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!\" \"It's not grandpa, Scoot's little fox kit friend got stuck in a bear trap, and he blocked me from shooting it,\" Alex paused, \"kind of like how Copper saved that fox, Tod. Or… his friend?\". \"This sounds crazy tah me kid! But, if what you are telling me is true, we gotta dispose of this here fox immediately\". \"But,\" Alex stammered, \"I don't want to hurt it. It's smarter than the other foxes we hunted. It seems to be friendly to me, too.\" Amos was conflicted, I kill those damn things! There shouldn't BE a fox on our property! And this kid thinks my Copper was friends with that rodent Tod? He's crazy! But, on the otherhand, there's nothing we can do about Scoot being lonely, so maybe I should let it slide for a while. \"Alrighty Alex, \"Amos finally spoke, \"I'll let the little fox live, but I don't want our hounds hanging out with the wildlife! I want to check on those fellas when I get the chance. Then , we will plan from there. Sound good buddy?\" \"Yeah, granddad, thanks for understanding.\" \"No problem kiddo, no problem… by the way, you should take Scoot hunting in tha forest tomorrow. Just a little trial. Ok?\" \"I was planning that anyway!\" \"Good, Alex. Now I'm 'onna go think about what yer said!\" Amos left, and Alex had time to think about their conversation. Copper saved Tod from being killed. Scoot stopped me from killing a fox, also. Is there something with these animals that we don't understand? ... Or maybe it runs in the family.[Chapter 8] Chapter 7: A Difficult Release Sunday, North Forest Alex was taking Scoot and Shadow out hunting. He was planning to take them into the north forest. He wanted to see how the young hounds handled catching their prey. It was a gorgeous morning, perfect for a quick hunt! \"Alright! Scoot, Shadow, I want you guys to be on your best behavior in here! The forest is dangerous to little pups like you. But once you grow up, everything will be terrified of you! So, it all works out.\" Boy, Scoot thought , you almost have as much pride as Cap, Alex! I'm not going to catch anything today! I know how to hunt, dad told me, but I don't have any firsthand experience… I hope we don't run into that fox today… OH WAIT! I need to tell Shadow about Cap! \"Uhh, sis,\" Scoot asked his sister, do me a favor, ok?\" \"What you want Scoot?\" \"If you see any little foxes today, don't go after them, mmkay?\" \"Why?\" \"Because it might be my friend, and I don't want him to get killed!\" \"You have a … fox as a friend bro? You're weirdin' me out!\" \"I play with him during the week when no one's home... So… now I told you! We're good, right?\" \"Uhm, I guess, stuttered Shadow, \"what would dad say?\" \"He knows!\" \"Ok, then not my problem! No hunting little foxes then!\" \"Thanks sis!\" The trio continued walking through the forest. Shadow became interested in a butterfly buzzing around. Scoot noticed, but he didn't pay attention. He really enjoyed the forest though. All the sounds of the insects, the wind blowing through the trees. Yeah, this was the place for a hound to be! He felt a little jealous toward his fox friend, who lived in the forest. Suddenly, Shadow got the hint on something, \"Scoot! I got something! Follow me!\" She darted toward the scent. \"WAIT!\" her brother shouted behind her, \"slow down sis!\" Meanwhile, Alex was having trouble keeping up with the hounds. Brilliant! Now I'm going to lose them! Shadow kept chase, \"I GOT IT! IT'S SO CLOSE! IT'S SO!—\" *WHAM!* Shadow crashed into whatever she was chasing. \"Do you… mind? GET OFF ME!\" her target yelled. Scoot recognized the voice, \"C- c- Cap? What are you doing here?\" \"I live here, are you serious? And thanks to your sister, I'm now going to have the Be-IGGEST headache today!\" Cap groaned. Shadow jumped up, startled by the fox, \"WOAH! You know my brother?\" The kit answered, \"yeah, we're friends. You're Shadow , right?\" \"Yep that's me!\" the female hound proudly declared . \"Uhh.. sis,\" Scoot stammered, \"we should probably get back to Alex! He's training us, remember?\" \"Yep! Good idea bro!\" The two hounds started to leave. \"Uh, guys?\" Cap said, \"Nice introduction I... guess. I think I'm gonna follow you!\" The two hounds ran back towards Alex, while the fox cub trailed behind them in the trees. However, what they saw when they ran back to Alex left Scoot a little worried. There, in the middle of the trail, was a red adult fox, having a stare-down with Alex, who had his gun primed and ready to fire. The two puppies were in the bushes, and they didn't notice that Cap jumped down from the trees. \" Psst! Hey guys!\" \"Cap? Why did you follow us?\" questioned Scoot. \" That's my father right there!\" uh oh, thought Scoot, this doesn't look good. Scoot bolted out of the bush and met up with Alex, and Shadow followed. All three were staring at the animal in the middle of the road. \"Hey guys! You wanna help me get this guy?\" Alex said. \"What do we do now?\" asked Shadow. \" Just don't do anything ,\" whispered Scoot. He didn't want the adult fox to hear him. Alex noticed his hound puppies weren't doing anything, \"uh guys! ATTACK! Do something… please? I won't do anything until you attack guys, you won't miss out, I promise!\" However, to Alex's disbelief, the hounds didn't budge. The fox seemed to notice though, \"Huh, you guys gonna try to get me? I… I'll still get away kids!\" ?The hounds were unamused, and the fox kept blabbering on, \"But seriously, I try to find food for my family, and I'm left with… this?!\" \"We don't want to hurt you, fox. Chill out,\" Shadow said. \"Yeah, we're just training!\" Shouted Scoot, \"as long as we don't move, he won't move!\" Scoot motioned toward his master. This is definitely Cap's father! Too much pride, hopefully he doesn't get himself killed! \"Huh, I see…\" sighed the fox, \"never seen a hound not attack their game before. Probably cause your just kids I guess. Say, you think you can get that guy off my tail? I'd like to get home alive.\" Don't you recall that my dad didn't attack you, Tod? , thought Scoot. \"And how do we do that?\" Asked Scoot. \"Pretend you're on the trail of something else kid!\" The puppies didn't have to do anything, because at that moment, Cap jumped out of the bush, and crashed into Alex. \"HEY!\" Alex cried, \"watch where yer' headin' kit!\" \"I'm gonna BITE HIM!\" Cap screamed, \"IF HE COMES ANY CLOSER TO MY DAD!\" The adult fox noticed, \"Copper! Just run away!\" \"I'm going TO DAD! YOU RUN!\" the kit yelled. Alex was quite surprised, because in a couple seconds, the fox pair vanished. \"DARN IT!\" Alex complained, \"we had him too! Oh well, it's your first time out here, I'm sure you didn't understand you need to attack animals, guys!\" Back at the farm, Shadow had many questions for Scoot, about his relations with Cap. \"Ok, first of all,\" Shadow said, \"did that fox just call Cap, your friend, Copper?\" \"It's a long story sis. But basically, Cap's real name is Copper. Same as dad's name.\" Shadow was confused, \"So… why does he and dad have the same name?\" Scoot sighed, ugh, here we go. \" Our dad was friends with a fox named Tod. That fox in the forest was Tod. He named his kid after Dad. End of story. Good? I don't want to repeat it again. Also, don't tell dad his real name, it's a secret\". Shadow sighed, \"gee, our family is really weird.\" \"You have no idea\".[Chapter 9] Chapter 8: Trouble on the Horizon Thursday Throughout the week, Cap, Scoot and Shadow played in their field. So now, they could play tag! Of course, Cap was the fastest, but the hounds were stronger, and could seriously do some damage once they caught up. They never played too rough though, as they didn't want to hurt their fragile friend. \"Boy,\" Cap said, \"if my father saw me playing with you two, he would kill me!\" Cap laughed, \"But I don't care!\" \"You could just say that he's being hypocritical!\" Shadow replied. \"Yeah, but he's got a point, Shadow,\" her brother said, \"it's still dangerous with him being here.\" The head of an older hound popped out of the bush. \"What are you doing dad?\" asked Scoot. \"Just checking up on you kids, that's all,\" Copper replied. \"You wanna join us in tag?\" offered Cap, \"Just so you know, I'm the fastest!\" Copper laughed at Cap's cockiness before saying, \"I know you probably are Cap. But no, I didn't come here to play tag. I came to warn you kids, especially you .\" \"me?\" Cap asked, \"Warn me about what?\" Copper sighed, \"Alrighty then. Amos is bringing home another hound dog, and Alex's dad is going to use him. The hound's name is Buster, and unlike me, he prefers to toy with his catch\" Copper paused. \"If he finds out that you are hanging around our property, he will kill you.\" \"Oh Buster,\" Scoot whined, \"He's such a jerk I didn't even do anything to him and he antagonized me.\" \"Yeah, why should I be afraid of some stupid mean hound?\" asked Cap. Copper's tone became serious, \"Cap, he won't just kill you. He will rip your body apart, and tear you to shreds, all while you're still alive.\" Cap responded, \"Well that's kinda grueso—\" \"He likes torturing his prey, Capper. I don't want to see you get mangled.\" Copper sighed, \"Go back home, Cap. To the forest. You're safer there… but I know you won't listen.\" Copper sighed again, \"Just like your father, you want to be with your… friends.\" Scoot was saddened by his father's sentiment. \"So, now I'm losing my friend, dad ?\". He started to cry. \"Don't think about it like that, Scoot,\" Copper said, \"you know Cap can't be around here forever. He's a fox. If you really care about him, you'd let him go.\" Cap interrupted, \"WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO GO?\". Copper was frustrated, and taken aback by Cap's outburst, \"It's your choice.\" He started walking back through the bush, \"But I don't want to watch you die .\" The kids were shocked by Copper's last point. It was back to just the three of them in the field. The silence that followed left the situation unsettling. \"He's right\", said Scoot whilst fighting back tears, \"You need to go Cap.\" Now cap was crying too. \"I know\" he retorted, \"bUT I DON'T WANT TO!\" Shadow was getting annoyed by the boys complaining, \"Oh come on, you're boys! Man up! You got two days till that jerk arrives! Enjoy it while it lasts.\" On that note, the young hounds and Cap parted ways. \"I- I'll see you tomorrow… right?\" whimpered Cap. \"I'll see you tomorrow,\" Scoot responded. Friday Scoot slept in, past when Alex went to School. He, Chief, and Copper were in their doghouse. He awoke to his father having a sad expression. \"Alex didn't do it\" Copper said. \"What?\" asked Scoot. \"Alex didn't do it, son\". Chief turned over, \"What are you two yapping about?\" \"I don't know what dad means, Chief,\" replied Scoot, \"I don't under—\" Then he saw it. Scoot realized in horror, that his collar was attached to a leash, attached to his doghouse, preventing him from going anywhere. \"It was his dad\". A/N: Alright guys! If you enjoy this story, please throw a comment! It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside when someone appreciates my work! (It also motivates me to continue!) The next chapter, Cap get's to meet Chief! Uh oh!)[Chapter 10] Chapter 9: Chief's Dilemma Friday, Continued \"NO!\" screamed Scoot, \"I promised him that I would see him today!\" Chief noticed Scoot's outburst, \"What do you mean you promised him you would see him today?\" \"My friend! I said I would meet him today! Grrrrrr…\". Scoot started biting at his leash, tugging and pulling on it, with hope that it would give out. Unfortunately, he wasn't strong enough to remove himself from the chain. Chief and Copper were entertained by the pointless attempt to unleash himself. \"Son,\" said Copper, \"ya gotta chill out kid. Just one day wouldn't hurt. You'll be fine. Now, I gotta go\". As Copper walked away Scoot could be heard screaming, \"BUT I PROMISED!\". \"Scoot! Where are you!\" Capper was in the field, trying to find where his friend could be, \"are you hiding?\" He started to get worried, \"Don't play these games, Scoot! You know I'll eventually find you… if you're here \". \"My, my Scoot, I haven't been able to spend any time with you! But now I can!\" cheered Chief. They were still in their doghouses, respectively. Scoot groaned. I'd rather be with my friend Copper, sorry Chief. \"Why did he do it?\" asked Scoot. \"do what, Scoot?\" chief asked. \"Why did he chain me up?\" Chief knew why Liam tied Scoot, but he wanted to tell it slant, \"He wants you to be safe Scoot. You can't go running past the bushes! There are dangerous animals there! Also, you might run into some nasty creatures… like foxes, racoons, squirrels. He doesn't want you to get bit.\" Chief's reasoning made Scoot upset, \"Foxes are nasty creatures, uncle Chief? I thought we killed them? Aren't we the monsters?\" Interesting reply kiddo. \"Yes, we kill them! Because they are nasty creatures! They try to eat our chickens! Heck, one even gave me this broken leg!\" Chief lifted his broken leg, and whined. \"So yes Scoot, foxes are vile, evil creatures. We kill them! Happy I answered your question?\" Scoot replied, \"No, but now I know how prejudice you really are. Thanks for showing your true colors.\" Chief became confused. \"You callin' me prejudice ? It's what we're supposed to do! We are raised to hate wildlife. That's why we hunt 'em. You are being delusional!\" \"Well, Uncle Chief, I'm not so delusional as I understand that there are two sides of every conflict— \" \"and WHAT would that BE exactly?\" \"I know how you got that broken foot.\" \"Oh, really?!\" \"And quite frankly, it is YOU who are in the wrong!\" Chief was furious, \"so you are telling ME, your UNCLE, that I was in the WRONG for chasing a FOX that I was supposed to KILL? We can't be friendly to foxes. What other side of the story is there to that?\" Scoot retorted, \"Well Uncle Chief you see, I'm friends with a fox. I know you can't understand that, so I'll say it again: I am friends. With. A. Fox. \" Chief stared at Scoot with disbelief, with a worried expression, \"any other stupid things you want me to believe, Kid?\" \"Yeah\", replied Scoot, \"the fox I'm friends with… is the son of the fox that you tried to kill.\" Chief became angrier, \"OK KID! Now you're just making stuff UP!\" \"Am I?\", Scoot said sarcastically, \"ok, how about this, Uncle Chief. You chased Tod on the railroad tracks, you deserved to get hit—\" \"DON'T YOU EVER MENTION THAT NAME AGAIN, do you hear me?\" Chief growled at Scoot. \"I'm not afraid of you, \"Scoot smirked, \"Tod was innocent. End of story.\" Chief was dumbfounded, \"you're siding with the wildlife, kid . Don't be so stupid. Your dad will set you straight. Soon enough, you might be killing that 'friend' of yours for all I—\" \"Yeah, I don't think so,\" scoot interrupted. By this point, Chief was fuming. \"You dare to interrupt me?\" Scoot laughed. \"you think dad is going to force me to kill my friend? I see he hasn't told you about the skeleton's in his closet, haha!\" \"Whatever, you're a kid. Kids can be stupid. Eventually, you will learn your place in the world.\" \"And you, Chief , are a grumpy old dog who doesn't like when others have different views than you do!\" \"Just save your breath kid, I'm done arguing with you.\" Chief was exhausted, and went back to sleep. Scoot did the same. \" Psst. Hey, Scoot. Wake up.\" \"Cap?\" Scoot opened his eyes. His fox friend was in his doghouse. Wait, Cap is here… oh no. \" Cap, leave. It's not safe for you here!\" Scoot whispered. \" You think I don't know that braniac? I just wanted to see where you were! Heck, I was worried about you!\" Cap whispered . \"Cap, be quiet, \" Scoot whispered back. \"you'll wake Chief!\" What Scoot didn't realize was that Chief was awake, and he was listening to their whole conversation. Cap and Scoot both peaked out of the doghouse, but were met with the angry snarling face of an old hound. \"What the hell is going on?\" Chief yelled, \"I'll give you one chance, fox, only because I don't want to deal with Scoot crying over a dead pest. You have ten seconds to leave… NOW!\" But the little fox was discouraged, \" Oh, so you're giving me a chance? That's really funny Chief. In fact, if I recall, you didn't give Copper and my Dad a chance , did you?\" \"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?\". Scoot explained, \"so as it turns out, Dad was friends with his Dad. Weird huh?\" \"I can't take this anymore!\" Chief fainted. Scoot and Cap stared at each other for a solid minute. \"So\", Cap said, \"I guess we can play now?\" \"Uhh, yeah, I guess\". A couple hours later, Copper came home, to a very flustered Chief. \"Hey Chief!\" said Copper, \"Why do you look so mad?\" The old hound stared at him. \"See for yourself,\" he replied. Chief moved out of the way, and there, in Scoot's doghouse, was Scoot sleeping, next to a curled-up Cap. This kid is going to be the death of me, thought Copper. \"SCOOT!\" Copper yelled, startling both Scoot and Cap, \"Get up! You have some explaining to do!\" \"Wha, what?\" the startled puppy asked, \"What dad?\" Then he remembered, \"Oh, yeah I don't know why he's here\". \"Oh please son,\" interrogated Copper, \"don't play dumb with me.\" \"Dad, I'm on a leash.\" Copper realized his son couldn't go anywhere. \"oh yeah, right, I forgot.\" He glared at the fox. \"You are going to get yourself killed! Why did you come here?\" Cap was shaking, \"Scoot- wasn't- at- our- meeting- place, sir. I was worried about him—\" \"Well isn't that fine and dandy!?\" Chief interrupted. \"you were worried about a hound. Likely story. And to think, you wouldn't even exist to bother me if I killed that meddlin' father of yours!\" \"Chief, come on,\" replied Copper, \"He's just a ki—\" \"He's a FOX, Copper. I don't care if it's a 'kid'\", Chief retorted, \"Now don't be getting all fuzzy with these pests.\" \"Chief, come on pal, Scoot was lonely before he met Cap, at least he hasn't been moping arou—\" \"AND YOU KNOW ITs NAME, HOW?\" \"Uhh, dude,\" Cap said, \"I told him my name. He's cool with me, why aren't you?\" \"Because, you little pest,\" Chief stated, \"I killed your kind. I loved killing foxes. You think I'm going to be okay with my nephew hanging out with you dirty rodents? Not a chance.\" \"Yeah, I know, \"Cap responded, \"which explains why you weren't cool with our dad's hanging out, jerk!\" Now, Chief was getting ready to pounce on the kit. \"What are you talking about now!?\" Ughhhh, you are really testing me Cap. I'm trying to get you out of this hole, and now you're dragging me down with you, Copper thought . He grunted . \"Cap, there's certain things you shouldn't say out loud, and now you're getting me in trouble. Go. Home… NOW.\" Cap sadly nodded, and took off toward the forest before Chief could attack him. \"So, Copper, \"Chief sighed, \"I want the truth. NOW.\" \"What other choice do I have? The kid set me up\", copper replied. And so, Copper told Chief everything about him and Tod: from when they were young, to finding out that Cap was his son. Scoot was present, and already knew the story, but he stayed to listen, anyway… not like he had a choice in the matter. Chief was still shocked by this news, but he had a better understanding of why Copper let Cap run away from them. \"So,\" Chief said, \"that fox way back when, came over to visit you?\" \"Yeah, Chief,\" said Copper, \"we were secret buds. It's why I ran away all the time, we played in the field that Scoot and his fox friend play in now.\" \"But I thought you killed it in the game reserve, Copper. You were hunting him down!\" \"Yeah, but I wasn't going to kill someone who nearly gave their life for me! Heck, even Amos understood that: he didn't try to shoot him after I blocked him.\" \"So, that kid, Cap... is Tod's son\", Chief sighed. He just found out that the fox who caused his broken foot wasn't dead. He also realized he could have killed his son, moments before. That would send a message! But Scoot thinks that we're the monsters, chief thought , maybe I'm the monster. I don't want the kid to hate me. \"Look, Copper, I'm sorry. I'm sorry too Scoot. You know I hate those darn creatures. But, if it drives you further away from me, which I don't want; then I'll try my best to not let my instincts take control of me.\" \"I understand, uncle Chief, \"Scoot beamed. \"I'm sorry for acting like a jerk too.\" \"Apology accepted kid\". Chief still didn't like the idea of Scoot being friends with a fox, especially with it being the offspring of the animal that nearly killed him , but he wanted the puppy and him to get along. Scoot sighed, \"I just wanted to spend the next few days with Cap, since Buster is coming back in a day. Cap knows he can't visit after Buster arrives. And...\". Scoot started crying, \"then I'll never see him again…\". \"Son,\" Copper said, \"I'll make sure that Liam doesn't hook you up tomorrow. And if he does… I'll break the chain\". \"Really dad?\" questioned Scoot. \"Really, Scoot.\" Bonfire Amos was enraged, \"LIAM! Why did you lock scoot up all day? The poor runt needs to get exercise.\" His son replied, \"look, father. I know Scoot needs exercise. I don't want him getting bit by a rabid animal, that's all. I know he likes to run behind the bushes, and that's too far for my comfort.\" \"But Dad,\" it was Alex. \"Scoot loves running around in that field! He's not going to get hurt.\" \"I know what's best for your dog, son,\" Liam glared. He was not fond of any of the dogs running away from home, even if they weren't too far away. He was a bit of a control freak, and worried a bit too much. \"Well I want Scoot to be happy… so I'm unleashing him tomorrow!\" Alex finished, before leaving the bonfire to go to bed. It was only the two adult men at the fire pit tonight, the dogs were all sleeping in their houses. \"Son,\" Amos broke the silence, \"listen. Ah used to hook Copper up to his barrel when he was a puppy, and I've never seen a more miserable pet in all mah life. It would be wrong to repeat that with Alex's dog.\" \"And you are ok with him running by the pond?\" Liam asked. \"Well, since Ah'm home tomorrow,\" Amos continued, \"Ah'll make sure that runt stays outta trouble! Alex will also accompany me.\" Liam nodded. The two of them got up, and parted ways.[Chapter 11] Chapter 10: Staring into the Eyes of the Enemy Saturday Today was the last day Scoot knew he would get to play with Cap. Much to his shock, his Collar wasn't tied to his doghouse anymore, which meant that he was free to roam. Free to meet up with his friend for the last time. It was already late in the morning, so he started to run towards the field. His friend was right there waiting for him. \"So,\" Cap said, \"this is our last day together, right pal?\" \"Yep\", the puppy replied, \"What do you want to do?\" Cap ran up the nearest tree, and laid on the branch, looking over his friend. Caps expression turned into an evil smile. \"I want you to finally climb this tree!\" he said. Scoot was getting better at this endeavor, but now his friend wants him to just do it? It's still amazing he could get halfway up the tree. He is a dog, after all. So, Scoot did what his friend wanted him to do. He took a running leap, grabbed onto the trunk of the tree, and started to scale it. Using all his forward momentum, he could hop off the trunk, and grab onto the branch. After a moment of dangling in the air, he could hoist himself onto the branch, joining his friend. \"Wow!\", Scoot screeched, \"You actually did it! Now I can't escape from you\". He smirked, \"but I'm not worried about you buddy!\" \"Uhh, Cap,\" Scoot questioned, \"how do I get down from here?\" Cap chuckled, \"same way you got up, Mutt! Just go backwards!\". Cap paused, \"but why not stay up here for a bit? You can get a great view from the trees!\" he continued. \"Yeah! I can see my house from here!\" the young Mutt exclaimed. He could see his family, down on the farm, going about their daily lives. \"Wanna know a secret?\" Cap asked. \"I'll bite\", Scoot replied. Cap continued, \"I actually had the same trouble you did with climbing trees!\" \"Really?\" asked Scoot. \"Yeah! Red foxes can't naturally climb trees!\" Cap said, \"I have a gray fox friend who showed me! It used to be really hard for me to do, but now I can climb with ease!\" \"So, what you're saying,\" Scoot said, \"is that you couldn't climb any trees before, but now you can? Like I just did?\" \"Yeah, Scoot,\" his friend replied, \"It was just as difficult for me, as it is for you. But who cares about that! Enjoy the view!\" Scoot kept watching his home in the distance. Until, he saw Alex approaching the bushes… with Amos. \"Uhh, hey Cap! We got Alex and his Grandpa approaching, what do we do?\" asked Scoot nervously. Cap smiled and responded, \"Just stay up here!\" he winked at Scoot, \"they'll eventually see us!\" So, the two friends decided to stay put, while the two humans were searching the floor below them. \"You said the pup is usually around here, Alex. I don't see him anywhere!\" Amos said. \"No, he's usually around here with that fox, grandpa. I just don't know where he could be!\" Alex replied. They still didn't notice the two animals above their heads. I'm going to give them a hint, Scoot thought. He gave a short bark. \"I hear Scoot!\" Alex exclaimed, \"but where is he?\" Scoot barked again. Alex looked up towards the tree. \"No way!\" he said, \"Grandpa, Scoot is in the tree!\" Amos looked confused, \"you mean to tell me that your puppy climbed a tree? That's hard to beli—\" Then he saw it. \"He's actually in the tree… with that fox,\" Amos sighed. \"Yeah,\" Alex replied, \"looks like they both got up there, and were watching us the whole time!\" Wait a second! Red foxes can't climb trees! \"I'm still not comfortable with him playing with that kit, Alex,\" Amos said, \"What if it tries to bite him?\" \"He's not gonna bite him, grandpa!\" Alex snapped, \"They seem to be good friends.\" \"Well maybe I just don't trust those animals,\" Amos stated. \"Oh, chill out grandpa! He's harmless,\" Alex retorted, \"Hey Scoot, come down here boy!\" He yelled to his dog, \"Bring your little friend down with you!\" \"I think he wants us to get down,\" Scoot said to his orange friend, \"here goes nothing!\" Scoot started to walk towards the tree trunk. \"Just try to run down!\", his friend yelled, behind him. With a leap, Scoot jumped onto the tree trunk, vertically, and attempted to run down it. He nearly made it down, but tripped when he was a meter off the ground. Cap was laughing as he followed behind. \"You still need to get that safer landing down, mutt!\" he laughed, \"but you get a B+ for effort!\" The two friends stood in front of the two humans, the older one slightly bewildered at what he just witnessed. Amos and Cap's eyes locked. I'm supposed to be killing these things! Amos thought. But this little kit seems to not mind me at all. He's tame for a woodland creature. Almost like he was once someone's pet. And it wears a cap on its head, odd. Unbeknownst to Cap, this was the same man who tried to kill his father over a year earlier. \"Hey, you guys wanna play catch?\" Alex asked the two young animals. He threw the tennis ball toward the lake. Without fail, the fox and the hound ran toward the ball to retrieve it. Cap was the fastest, so he got to it first, but he kicked the ball back toward Alex, instead of grabbing it with his mouth. \"See grandpa! The little guy is playful too!\" Alex exclaimed. \"I have no words for this situation, Sonny. Everything I have seen today is unbelievable to me. Instead of these two being at each other's throats, they instead, are keeping each other company,\" said Amos. \"Yeah! It's kinda weird, but still kinda cool! The little guy will probably let me pick him up, watch!\" Alex knelt on the ground, holding his hands out toward the fox. Cap was confused by this motion, but was startled when he was picked up off the ground. His instinct almost took over, by almost biting Alex, but his head being scratched put the thought to rest. This feels reeeally nice, Cap thought. I wonder if this is how dad felt when he still had the old lady as his owner. \"Cap\" Scoot asked, \"are you okay with him holding you like that?\" \"Yeah Scoot, he's just petting me. It's actually pretty comfortable!\" \"Alex seems to really like you then! Isn't that funny how he tried to kill you last week?\" \"It was just a misunderstanding,\" the fox beamed, \"we're cool now!\" Amos, however, was not cool with his grandson holding the baby fox. \"Sonny, what in the blazes made you think to do that? What if that thing has disease?\" \"Oh come on grandpa!\" Alex retorted, \"He's fine! He's calm and isn't struggling, so I think he feels perfectly safe—\" \"I'm more worried about you!\" Amos interrupted, \"I don't want it to bite you!\" \"Alright, fine! I'll put him down, you worry wart!\" Alex carefully set Cap back down on the ground. \"Hey!\" said Cap, \"You want to do some roughhousing? You know, like you dogs do, Scoot?\" \"I don't think it's a good idea with Alex and his—\" But, before Scoot could finish his sentence, his friend leaped onto him. Alright, two can play at that game! Thought Scoot. He kicked Cap off and started chasing him around the field. \"Don't forget!\" Cap said back, \"I'm the fastest! You can't catch me—\" because he wasn't looking, he slammed right into a tree. \"But not the brightest, kit!\" his friend shouted, gaining up on the young fox, before also pouncing on him. Tails wagging, they both started playfully gnawing at each other's ears. It was a sight to see, and to Amos, it reminded him of Copper and Chief when they were younger. \"Seems more like a dog,\" Amos said, \"Are you sure that's a fox, Sonny?\" \"Yeah, he's orange, got a white tipped tail, looks like a fox to me!\" Amos couldn't quite pinpoint it, but he thought there was something awfully peculiar about the situation, and the fox. \"There's something strange about that Kit, Alex. I'm drawing a blank, but this feels familiar.\" \"Not only that, Grandpa, but it wears a hat.\" Alex still didn't understand why a wild animal would wear a hat. He too, thought the fox was strange. He enjoyed watching it play with his puppy though. Amos looked at his watch. \"Well, it's noon Kiddo, I gotta go to the other farm. You might want to watch Copper, so he doesn't take an interest in your puppy's * ehm* 'friend' . \"Don't worry Grandpa,\" Alex said, \"I'll keep a good eye on them!\" Amos smiled back, \"I know you wil!\". And like that, Amos was gone, and it was just the fox, the hound, and the young hunter. The two animals were exhausted from their scuffle, and were laying down on the grass next to each other. Alex walked over, and sat right next to them, \"You guys are… something else! Little rebels!\" Scoot and Cap didn't really care to listen to Alex, they were all tired out. \"You know,\" Alex continued,\" grandpa thinks you have rabies or something, little fox. I know you don't, but I might be able to help you out.\" Alex left, heading back home. … Alex was searching through Amos' medicine cabinet. Let's see, heartworm, aspirin… ahh! Here it is! Rabies vaccine. Hmm, it says 'use only on canines'. I think foxes fit that family, so it should work for Scoot's little buddy. Now I just gotta poke 'em without him getting pissed off… … The two tired pups didn't notice they had an unexpected visitor. \"Hey, Cap, Scoot.\" No reply. \"CAP!\" \"WHAT?!\", the fox leaped up, also startling Scoot. \"what do you want Copper?\" Cap asked. \"Oh, nothing! Just wanted to see how you guys were doing!\" Copper replied. \"Dad, you didn't have to scare us.\" Scoot said, \"have you seen Alex by the way?\" Scoot didn't have to wait for an answer, as his owner came through the brush at that moment. \"Alright guys, I'm back and… wait Copper isn't attacking you?\" Alex froze. \"We'll, I guess he knows not to hurt your friend then.\" He walked toward the two younger animals, and knelt. Alright, how am I going to do this. Scoot walked up to his master, and licked his hand. \"I kinda need your friend right now, Scoot,\" Alex said. He patted the ground, trying to make eye contact with the fox. To his surprise, the fox walked toward him. \"What does he want?\" Cap asked. Copper noticed the needle, hidden behind Alex. Hee hee, kids getting shot. \" I don't know Cap, just walk up to him\", he said, trying to hold back the smile. \"Alright, I guess.\" Cap sat down in front of Alex. \"So, now what?\" I gotta do this quick! Alex thought. Without hesitating, he grabbed Cap's front paw, took the needle, and jabbed it into his leg. He let go fast, so he didn't get bit. The fox winced from the pain, but only noticed after the vaccine was administered. What was left, was a small bandage. \"OWWWWWW!\" Screamed Cap, \"Why does that burn? What did he do to me? Is he trying to kill me?\". Copper and Scoot were both on the floor laughing. \"No silly! Scoot chuckled, \"It's medicine so you don't get sick! I had it too!\" \"But why does it burn?\" the fox questioned. \"Cap,\" Copper chuckled, \"it goes through the needle, and it has to go through your skin. That's why it burned. It's always funny watching young animals get shots. They think it's the end of the world.\" Alex was now reaching into his pocket. He pulled out 2 objects. Copper and Scoot knew what they were, but Cap didn't have a clue. Whatever it was, it smelled good though. \"Here little guy,\" Alex said, \"dropping the object in front of Cap, \"this is for being a good sport about the whole… shot thing\". He split up the other object, and tossed the two parts to Copper and Scoot. They started chowing down on it immediately. Cap still wasn't sure what it was. I guess if Copper and Scoot are eating it, it must be safe. So, he grabbed the item and started chewing. Wow! This tastes amazing! It's crispy, juicy, and has good flavoring. It has to be some kind of meat. \"What is this?\" Cap asked. \"It's the best thing in the world! Bacon!\" his friend exclaimed, \"It's how humans eat pigs kinda.\" \"That's right\", Copper said, \"they don't eat meat raw. They cook it, and it gets rid of all the bad stuff.\" \"Well whatever it is,\" Cap said, \"It's darn good!\" \"Now don't get too used to that fox,\" Alex said, \"I'm not even supposed to feed you human food. It was a special occasion.\" He scratched Cap's cheek. He thought for a minute, \"What should I call you? You have a hat so, hat? Red? Cap? \" He knows my name! The fox jumped onto Alex. \"Ok! Alex shouted, \"Cap it is then, alright?\" Or can you get closer? Thought the fox. Cap jumped off Alex, and ran towards the hounds. He jumped onto Copper. \"What on Earth are you doing, Cap? Get off me\" Copper said. \"Give me a second, Copper!\" Cap replied. Alex walked over to them. \"So wait, you jumped on Copper. Is this telling me something? Should I call you Cap or Copper?\" Alex pondered, \"You know what! I'll call you Capper ! How's that?\" Cap once again, jumped onto Alex. \"Alright, Alright! Capper it is then!\" \"Wow!\" exclaimed Scoot, \"You got him to say your name! That's so cool\" \"Yeah!\" shouted Cap, \"me and Alex are good friends now!\" \"You know, \"Copper said, \"I'm a little jealous how Alex is cool with you hanging out with Scoot, but his grandpa wouldn't let me hang out with your dad\". Capper realized something, \"Wait, Copper. Alex's grandpa was the one who tried to kill my dad?\" \"Affirmative\". \"But he was just here, and wasn't being mean or anything.\" \"That's because your father caused him to be less hateful. He still doesn't like you foxes, don't get me wrong. But he doesn't go around the farm shooting everything he sees anymore.\" \"I see, \"Scoot said, \"but Alex's dad is kinda mean.\" \"And that's why Cap can't hang around anymore after tomorrow,\" Copper said, \"It'll be him and the vicious Buster.\" He noticed Scoot's lip starting to quiver. \"But, I said he shouldn't hang around here. I'll show you a place where you guys can safely play.\" \"WAIT!\" shouted Cap, you mean I can still hang out with Scoot?\" \"Yeah,\" replied Copper, \"I figured if you guys weren't playing too close, you would be safe from that nasty hound.\" Alex was starting to get bored: you know, I do have a test to study for… \" Hey guys, I'm gonna go. Watch them for me, ok Copper?\" He stared at the dog for a few seconds, \"ok then, bye!\" Just like that, Alex left. \"He's certainly a strange fellow,\" Copper said, \"anyways, why don't the both of you follow me back home.\" The two young animals obliged and followed Copper. … \"Wait!\" Cap panicked, \"is it safe for me to go over there?\" Copper nodded, \"Chief won't hurt you Cap. In fact, he knows where you guys can go while Buster is here.\" \"I hope you're right, Copper,\" Cap said, \"I still don't trust him. Scoot, Copper and Cap each walked up to the row of doghouses, were Chief was laying. \"Well look who it is, \"the older hound mocked, \"Scoot and his lil' vermin buddy.\" Cap growled at Chief. \"Oh, you're adorable ,\" Chief mocked, \"I could kill you right now you know!\" \"Chief no! Leave him alone!\" shouted Scoot. \"But I'm not going to kill you,\" Chief continued, \"I just want you away from my property\". Cap decided to speak, \"So apparently, you know someplace we could hang out safely, right? The fox was a little intimidated by the snarling hound. \"Well yes I do, little pest. You wanna know?\" \"Hey, Chief, be a little more polite towards the kid,\" said Copper. \"Yeah,\" added Cap, \"I get that you and my dad hate each other, but umm, I'm different. And please stop calling me pest.\" \" LOOK,\" chief yelled, \"see that bridge in the distance, Cap? Is that better?\" \"Yes, and yes, sir.\" \"Alrighty, follow the road to the north about halfway to the bridge. There will be a yellow sign. Run to the right, and you should find a large space that you two can mess around in.\" \"Uhh, thanks, Chief,\" Scoot said, \"that was a nice thing to do.\" \"Well,\" Chief replied, \"I just want the brat away from here. The further away, the better. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm taking a nap. When I wake, I better not see that 'Cap'.\" As the hound fell asleep, Copper saw something in the distance. It was his master's truck. He could make out a certain black dog in the front. Black dog. Buster! \"Cap, you need to leave, NOW! Buster is here!\" , \"Copper scolded the fox. \"Alright, I'm as good as gone!\", Cap said. He swiftly removed himself from the scene, just in time, as Amos and Buster were getting out of the truck. While Buster and Copper are both hound dogs, they couldn't be any more different. Buster liked to hunt aggressively, while Copper executed his hunts more calmly. Buster liked to mess with his prey, while Copper would try to end its suffering. Copper was humble about his title, while Buster would be bragging and brash about himself, towards other hounds. In other words, other hounds respected Copper, because he was respectful towards them. But, they respected Buster out of fear. Buster and Amos arrived at the doghouses. \"Hey Copper,\" Amos said, \"I decided to grab him a day early. We only have a couple days till we gotta train the pups\". Buster grinned at Copper, while Copper scowled back. \"Well,\" started Buster, \"if it isn't Copper and his pip-squeak scoot. Been about a month now, hey kid\". \"Listen,\" Copper grunted, \"if you are going to start trouble, you might as well just turn around.\" \"Yeah,\" said Scoot, \"we don't want to hear you demean us.\" The black hound laughed, \"Surely you must understand I'm just teasing ya Scoot?\" \"Right…\". \"You know me and your father get along well, right Copper?\" Copper rolled his eyes. \"Well,\" he jeered, \"if you aren't going to bully my son like you did when you first met him , then maybe we can get along. I doubt that will be the case though.\" Buster interjected, \"really? That's a bit demanding Copper, you know I can't be nice\", the hound smirked. \"As for you, Scoot: be on your best behavior, and I won't have to 'demean' you. Ta-ta!\". Buster left Copper and Scoot, to see what Amos was up to. \"He's such a jerk, dad.\" \"I know Scoot, I know.\" … Bonfire, Friday Night As usual, the hounds laid down on one side of the bonfire, while the humans sat down on the other. Tonight, they were eating smores. \"It's about to git more crowded here!\" said Amos, \"we have a bunch of puppies and their owners coming, so you better head to town tomorrow and git some of em marshmallows, Alex. These smores ain't gonna make themselves.\" \"If you give me money granddad, I don't have a job, remember?\" \"Oh. But you will Sonny,\" replied Amos, \"you will. In fact, I'll pay you to train the dogs. A couple hours a day.\" \"Seems fair, grandpa,\" Alex remarked, \"What do you think, dad?\" \"If you keep those puppies out of harm's way, then you should be mighty fine,\" Liam replied. \"Oh, I almost forgit!\" exclaimed Amos, Widow is making a buncha pies for everyone tomorrow. You should see if you could give er a hand er two.\" \"I'll consider it, grandpa.\" While the humans were absorbed in their conversation, the dogs were having one of their own. Shadow and Scoot were on the far left, Copper next to them to the left of Chief. Buster was all the way on the right, keeping his distance from the kids. \"Those things look delicious,\" said Scoot, \"I want one!\" \"Darling. \" Daisy responded, \"those aren't good for puppies to eat. Chocolate will make you sick, and so will the marshmallows. You might be able to steal some of those graham crackers though,\" she smirked. Buster, on the other hand, didn't want to talk about marshmallows. Instead, he was thinking of ways to get under Copper's skin. \"So, Copper,\" Buster spoke, \"you run into your little forest friend recently? You know I'd love to sink my teeth in him,\" he grinned. Copper pondered, so you turn the conversation to attacking Tod, Buster? It just shows the kind of hound you are. Jealous of me, because I'm better than you, and I'm still acquainted with a game animal. \"I get it,\" copper grumbled, \"you're jealous of me, because despite me having a fox friend, I'm a better hunter than you,\" he paused, \"But there's no reason to bring Tod into this. Change the subject please.\" \"Wait dad,\" Scoot gasped, \"Buster knows about Tod?\" \"And apparently so do you!\" Buster jeered, \"hopefully you're not stupid enough to befriend your prey. That's just asking for trouble!\" Scoot was becoming mad, \"Oh yeah? Well dad's still better than you.\" \"Is that all you got, pipsqueak?\" laughed the black hound. Scoot sighed, \"I got nothing. Maybe you won— \" \"Yeah!\" shouted Shadow, \"I'd rather be friends with a game animal than someone the likes of you!\" All the hounds were shocked by Shadow's outburst, especially her mother. \"Honey,\" Daisy began, \"It's not wise to get angry like that. Don't let him get to you.\" \"I know momma, but he attacked Scoot, and I found it reasonable to defend my brother.\" \"I'm so touched,\" Scoot mocked, \"Anyway, jerk, how do you know about dad's friend?\" Buster chuckled, \" Everyone has a story to tell, Scoot ,\" … \" maybe one day you'll find out mine .\" END OF PART I What is Buster really hiding? What will Liam Alex's father do when he finds out about Cap? And what about that hunt training that happens in a week? Find out next week, in Part II![Chapter 12] A/N: Alrighty guys, here's part two! Took a couple weeks to finish it, but it's around the same length as part 1. Like I said, I write out the whole part and then go back and revise it. I didn't like how I originally planned it, so it took a while to get it to a point I liked. You also gotta take a break, as to not burn out. A character sheet will follow this chapter, summarizing all of the important characters, and their roles in part one. New chapter every 1 - 2 days! Each part has ten chapters! Enjoy! PART II The Hunt Begins Chapter 11: Moving Day Sunday, North Forest It was about 11 in the morning. Cap was wide awake, spending some time with his parents. He did a good job of keeping his little secret away from them. They were showing Cap and his sister Lily how to hunt for mice in the ground. Tod, on the other hand, has never been happier. He was with his family, in the safety of their forest home. Nothing could ruin this moment. \"Alright Copper, so what ya gotta do is stand still, and wait.\" So, Cap did what he was told. \"Like this?\" he asked. \"Perfect,\" replied his father, \"the next step is to tilt your head toward the direction you feel the ground vibrate.\" So, Cap closed his eyes, and concentrated. Then, he felt it. Directly beneath him, there were vibrations. He tilted his head, toward the direction. \"You feel that mouse moving Copper?\" Tod asked his son. \"Yeah dad, it's to the left of me, and it's staying near the same spot.\" Tod beamed, \"alright kid! Now DIVE!\". \"What?!\" questioned Cap. \"Dive into the ground! Catch the mouse!\" Alright, here goes nothing, thought Cap. With all his energy, he dove headfirst into the ground. He was surprised when his mouth caught a hold of something furry. I got it ! He thought. With his hind legs, he could pop himself back out of the ground, with his prey. His father was rather pleased. \"Alright Copper,\" he said, \"you are free to roam the forest if you'd like. Just be careful, I trust you.\" \"Ok, thanks dad! I'll stay in the forest!\" Of course, Cap wasn't going to roam the forest , he was heading toward Scoot and his new meeting place. \"It's your turn now Lily! Just remember what I told your brother!\" Tod said. Lily grumbled, and her mother chuckled at her. … Slade Residence Widow Tweed, Amos, and Liam weren't the only homeowners on the block. Next door to the younger Slade's house, lived a grumpy Vietnam veteran, and his wife and only son. They were irritable, and were hard to get along with. In fact, no one in the neighborhood got along with them. They never wanted to talk to anyone. They simply stayed inside their home, unless they needed to run to the store. So, Alex did his best not to pay attention to them. One big problem he had, however, was that the son, named Jacob, was a student just like him, and they bumped heads far too often in school. Flashback: At college \" Well if it isn't the kid with the stupid hound dogs!\" \" Well if it isn't the kid who has no friends, and never talks to anyone!\" \" You wanna fight, Slade?\" \" I have much better things to do, like NOT get kicked out of school. You can go ask some other loser, if you want to 'fight' \". Anyone watching the argument was laughing. Jacob was infamous at the campus, for trying to start fights daily. No one was ever dumb enough to accept it though. There were many responses to his \"challenge\" such as: \" You'll probably just pussy out and tell your hard-ass dad that I was gonna kick your ass\". \" I don't want to send you to VA hospital, kid.\" \" Fights are soooo high school. When are ya gonna grow up, tike?\" Now, Alex was nowhere near being a school bully, but sometimes dealing with Jacob was too much to handle. \" So, what's his problem today, Alex?\" asked Alex's best friend Josh. \" He's just bitching, like he always does, that my hound 'Scoot' is making too much noise during the day, which is complete bullshit,\" replied Alex. \" Hah, seems like you got a long time to deal with him then?\" \" Tell me about it. At least everyone thinks it's funny.\" End Flashback Yep, Jacob had a huge problem with his neighbor's dogs. His father would always yell out the window, telling them to 'shut up' so he could have some 'peace and quiet'. Liam and Alex just ignored him, it was best that way anyway. While Alex was busy inside working on a personal project, Scoot ran towards the field near the bridge. \"Be careful kid!\" Shouted Chief. \"You know I will! Scoot shouted back, as he gained speed. He ran past the original field him and Cap played in. Eventually, the road came into view, and he ran alongside it for a couple minutes. Eventually, the silhouette of the bridge turned into the bridge itself. He knew he was close. He spotted a yellow \"road curves right\" sign. This is the place! He thought. Finally, running to the right of the sign, he ran into the even larger open field, at least twice as big as their old one. Side of the Road \"Took ya long enough\" said the familiar furry animal. \"It's kinda far!\" said Scoot, \"took me a while to get here. Anyways, anything cool you found?\" \"Well,\" Cap replied, \"there's a quarry to the East, a giant bridge to the north with a big river, but besides that, not really. There aren't even any good hiding spots!\" Cap frowned. \"Well that's the price you pay for getting away from Buster!\" Scoot exclaimed. Cap sadly nodded. \"Hey, the fox asked, \"how is that Buster jerk anyway?\" Scoot didn't even want to think about that question. He wanted to have just one day without thinking about that mutt, and now his friend brings him up? \"Uggh, fine,\" Scoot reluctantly answered, \"he's a jerk. A huge jerk. He tries to boss me around, and tell me what to do. But the worst part of all, he somehow knows about our… parents\". \"What do you mean?\" Cap shockingly asked. \"He knows that our parents were friends, and he really wants to kill your dad.\" \"B- but how does he know about it? Does he know about me? Oh gosh, I'm scared Scoot,\" Cap whimpered. Scoot breathed heavily, \"I don't know how he knows. He told me he had a story or something.\" Scoot paused, \"but he doesn't know about you.\" \"Well, that's a relief I guess… I was worried he would try to find me.\" \"I think we're fine, Cap. Say, let's go climb that bridge!\" \"I'll race you to the top!\" challenged Cap. \"Let's go!\" The two of them ran across the field, careful to avoid any trees (since Cap really like ramming into them at full speed, for some reason). Eventually, they got to the base of the bridge, and started climbing up the rocks. This gave Scoot an advantage, as he was stronger, and could lift himself up the mountain faster. They finally got to the top, both panting and out of breath. \"I guess we… tied\" Cap stammered. \"Yeah… I'm… exhausted,\" said Scoot, \"Let's lie down.\" Cap agreed. They each spent a couple minutes, taking in the view. Scoot noticed something about this place. \"Hey Cap, do you know where we are?\" \"Not really, why?\" \"This is the place where your dad almost killed Chief!\" \"Oh yeah! Now I remember! The river is a lot higher I think. You couldn't bash against the rocks if you tried.\" They heard a train whistle in the distance, and Cap could feel the distant trembling of the train. \"Here comes the train!\" He said. A couple minutes later, a passenger train sailed past them, some of the riders noticing the two unlikely friends. A couple seconds later and the train was gone. Cap knew that he couldn't be outside the forest for too long, or his dad would find out. \"Well, I gotta go Scoot. My dad's going to wonder where I am, and he can't find out about us. See ya!\" Cap said. \"Already?!\" Scoot Whined. \"Uhh, Nice seeing you again, Cap!\" the two friends headed home. Slade Farm \"Well, did you have a good time?,\" asked Chief, \"I don't know what a fox and hound do in a wide-open field. Might get boring\". Copper replied, \"I'm sure they had fun anyways, right Scoot?\" \"Yeah dad\", replied his Son, \" Cap and I actually climbed the quarry next to the big bridge! The river's pretty high now, unlike when Tod—\" \"ALRIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH!\" Shouted Chief, \"Don't mention that situation, or that name.\" \"I'm sorry Uncle Chief.\" Little did they know: a nosy black hound dog was listening to their conversation. Fox and Hound? Scoot climbed the quarry with someone today, he thought, who could that be? And he was having fun? He also mentioned Tod? Buster grinned, his inner laughter nearly breaking outside. Could Scoot be the key to killing Tod? Heheh, this could be useful information. He stepped out from his hiding spot, confronting Scoot. \"You know,\" Buster started, \"you and me would get along much better if we were honest with eachother.\" \"Uhh, no. we wouldn't,\" Scoot replied. Buster, shot down with Scoots response, decided to brute force his way to his desired answer. He questioned, \"So, who is this 'Cap'? You meet by the bridge with him?\" Copper stared at his son, Scoot understood what it meant. It was as if Copper's expression was saying: \" Don't tell him anything!\" \"I don't have to tell you anything Buster!\" Scoot shouted. \"I don't know what you're talking about, and you are NOT the boss of me!\" Buster smiled. \"it's a game animal, isn't it?\" Scoot was broken inside. H ow is he doing this to me? I didn't even tell him anything. But it's like he knows I'm lying. Buster chuckled, \"your silence is all I need to confirm my suspicions. Don't you know how to play when someone gets in your head?\" He laughed. \"Buster, stop,\" pleaded Copper, \"what did Scoot ever do to y—\" \"It's a fox… ISN'T IT?\" Buster interrupted. Once again, Scoot was speechless. But he understood how Buster played his 'game,' now. \"I'm not dumb like my dad, who plays with game animals, Buster. I'm a pure blooded huntin' dog! And my dad isn't going to change that! The wildlife is my enemy!\" Scoot gasped. I can't believe I just said that… about my dad! And about my friend. Oh. No. But, Buster seemed pleased. \"I guess I was wrong about you Scoot. Maybe you aren't as stupid as your father.\" Copper grumbled, but Buster ignored him. \"I'll leave you now, Scoot,\" said the black hound, \"forgive me for my insolence.\" Buster left the boys, and it was just them three again. \"I'm sorry I called you dumb dad! I didn't know how to not reveal my friend though.\" Copper simply chuckled, \"I know you didn't mean it son!\" \"Yeah\", said Chief. \"at least you got him off your tail.\" However, unknown to the three hounds, Buster knew Scoot was lying. I'm going to pay your 'friend' a visit, Scoot. Early in the morning, in your little meeting place. Buster grinned, if Cap is a fox, and he's a little kid… maybe I could torture him into luring Tod… AND I'LL KILL BOTH OF THEM! Part I Character Sheet Minor Characters Tod : A fox from Copper's past.

What could this mysterious hound be hiding?[Chapter 13] II Chapter 12: Still the Best of Friends Monday, Slade Residence Since it was Monday, Alex went back to school, and Scoot was lonely in the morning again. He accidentally slept through the afternoon, until the sound of a distant scream woke him up. The puppy got up, and was walking around his yard, trying to see if there was anything peculiar. Well that's odd, Scoot thought , Buster is nowhere to be seen ! But what was that scream? And then it hit him. Cap! Side of the road Cap was having a terrible time. Not only did his friend not show up, he had to deal with his friend's new psycho-maniac \"relative\". The hound picked Cap off the ground with his teeth, and threw him at the tree. There was no time for introductions, as Buster wanted to end the fox quickly. \"So, you're Cap, huh?\" Grimaced Buster, standing over the beaten-up fox kit. He threw him on the ground again. \"How do you know my name, Jerk?\" whined Cap. Buster beamed, \"seems like your 'friend' betrayed you. Funny how he isn't here to save you, huh. Quite the opposite of his father's experience, gwahaha.\" No, I refuse to believe it, thought Cap, Scoot wouldn't tell this bully about me! With all his energy, Cap darted past Buster. So unwise! thought the black hound, before giving chase. Cap searched for a safe place. There, he thought, spotting a small formation of rocks, with a space that was just large enough for him to crawl through. Before buster could catch up, he successfully dodged under the rock. Buster angrily swiped at him, but he could only get his claws mere inches away from Cap's face. Please help me Scoot! Scoot dashed up the road, I hope I'm not too late! He thought. He spotted the yellow sign, and his newfound enemy. His arrival just fueled the black hound's hatred even more. \"Look who decided to finally show up! Now I can teach you a huntin' lesson!\" Buster exclaimed. Scoot scowled and said, \"I'm here to teach you a lesson, jerk!\" Buster laughed at the puppy's ego. \"What lesson? Not to mess with your 'friend'? Whom you are bred to kill? You are a hound and he is a fox. Let me be clear, you are a hunting HOUND and he is a pestilent FOX\". Buster knew that Scoot was no match for him. \"And you are nothing but a jerk!\" said a young voice from under the rocks. Scoot ducked and noticed Cap, in his cramped safe space. \"When I get you,\" vowed Buster, \"I am going to RIP you APART!\" Cap screamed, \"somebody help!\" Copper and Slade arrived home, as it was 3 PM. They were getting ready for the onslaught of hunting dogs and their owners. That would happen tomorrow. When Copper got near Chief however, he had a worried expression. \"What's the matter ol' pal?\" the coonhound asked his superior. Chief never really worried about anything in his life. \"I heard screaming, Copper. Coming from the bridge!\" Copper understood completely, \"and with Buster missing that means...\". \"BUSTER FOLLOWED SCOOT!\" They shouted in unison. \"Chief, I have to go make sure Cap is safe. That conniving hound is going to kill him!\" \"Good luck to you, pal,\" said the older hound, as Copper took off toward the field. As it turns out, Chief wasn't the only canine who heard the screaming pleas of a kit. In the forest, a father heard his son's cry for help. That sounds like Copper , Todd thought. I'm coming for you, son! He didn't notice his daughter stalking him to his destination. What he didn't realize, was that he was going to meet someone he hadn't talked to in a long time. And, that the event would have negative consequences. Copper ran as fast as he could to the field. When he arrived, he was displeased at the sight. The black hound still didn't notice him; he was horrifying Cap about his \"plans\" for him. \"When I get to you, I'm going to Tear your face, bite off your legs, and rip out your throat.\" The hound laughed. \"The longer you wait under there, the worse your Demise will be. So, tick tock little fox .\" \"You... aren't going to kill me,\" Cap whimpered. Scoot was above the rocks, crying. His father was not pleased of the scene. \"That's enough!\" stormed Copper, \" leave, Buster!\" But the hound just smirked. \"You actually think I'm going to listen to you, best hunting dog ? You don't even deserve that title! Because you stick up for them!\" He pointed to Cap, who was crying under the rock alcove. Copper sighed, \"Yeah, I'm not the one screwed up enough to slaughter children. It's called not being a monster. You must be so proud! I don't EVER hunt children!\" Buster chuckled, \"That may be true, Copper. However, I'm inclined to believe you only protect this one, because it's friends with your kid.\" Copper was silent. Then Buster added, \"It might have to do with who the father is also... Heheheh.\" \"You want to deal with my father?\" whined Cap. \"He'll claw your eyes out, jerk!\" Buster came to a realization. Maybe my master could be the one to finish him off. It might be easier to get Tod that way. Buster sighed, \"You know what Cap, maybe you're right. Maybe I should mangle you up before my master instead! We can do this another day!\" Cap gulped. Buster started to leave for home. But he had to get one last word in, \"You'd look better with a bullet in your head\". He could be heard laughing as he left. Then, he was gone. But, he was actually hiding nearby. He knew his prey would come. Copper trembled, \"You know kid, I should say I'm surprised at what he said. But, I'm not. One bit.\" Cap crawled out from under his hiding spot. \"He's so mean, Copper. He just seems so full of hate.\" \"I told you so,\" Scoot mocked. \"he's just a jerk, nothing else to it!\" \"It seems like you're in danger anywhere you go now, Cap,\" sighed Copper, \"we gotta get rid-\" Copper's sentence was cut short. For an instant, he saw a flash of red, which then tackled him to the ground. \"Trying to show your little runt how to hunt my kid, eh?\" the attacker questioned. Copper was basically paralyzed. What attacked him, was the father of the young fox kit: an adult red fox. \"Dad?\" Cap questioned. The older fox noticed his son was beaten up a bit. He pressed down harder on Copper. \"And you've already injured him! You know what I do to hounds who hurt my family? I knock some sense into their heads!\" \"Dad, wait, stop!\" Cap yelled. \"You stay out of this Copper! You don't know their kind like I do!\" the father shouted back. For that moment, Copper completely forgot that it was Tod who was Cap's father. It was Tod who attacked him. He was able to release enough energy to throw the fox off of him. \"You are blaming me for attacking your son, fox? If you were here a couple minutes earlier, you would know I did quite the opposite\". The fox growled, \"you are lying. You are showing your kid how to kill game. That's all you hounds EVER. DO. I guess I have to kill you now in front of your son. A shame, it's not how I usually deal with you mutts.\" \"So be it, fox,\" Copper groaned. He lunged for the fox, but Todd dodged his attack. They ran around each other, trying to get the perfect critical blow. Their sons were horrified. \"Your dad is trying to kill my dad!\" cried Scoot. \"And your dad is trying to kill my dad!\" cried Cap. What could have been solved with a simple explanation, evolved into a fight for survival. The fox was quite strong, Copper was surprised, despite him being heavier. In the end however, Copper stood the victor. He stood on top of Tod's exhausted body, pressing lightly on his throat. Tod's face was full of sadness. He let a hound beat him, and now he thought he was going to kill his son. \"Im sorry Copper!\" he wept, \"I couldn't save you!\" Copper didn't pay attention to Tod's whining, and pressed harder on Tod's throat. However, Tod was able to latch onto Copper's paw with his teeth. The children had had enough. \"Tod!\" Scoot screamed, \"stop hurting my dad!\" \"What?!\" Tod cried, surprised, and released Copper's paw. Copper still didn't let go of him. \"Copper, get off my dad, please,\" Cap cried. \"Cap, if he hadn't attacked me...\" Copper yelled. Tod still had no idea what was going on, but Copper softened up on his grip. \"Tod, listen to me!\" Scoot pleaded. \"Why would I listen to you?\" Inquired the fox, \"and how in the hell do you know my name?\" Scoot exclaimed, \"Because me and Copper are best friends!\" Copper finally snapped out of it. He knew who he was attacking. It was his best friend. And now he knew Cap's real name. He still pinned Tod down, but released his paw from his throat. \"You're best friends with a fox, you little mutt?\" Tod asked, confused. \"His name is Scoot, dad,\" Cap interrupted, \"and he's my friend. Just like you have a friend who's a hound. As a matter of fact, you named me after him, remember?\" Copper lept off of Todd. The fox was still a little confused. \"I named you after my friend, Copper. What does that have to do with anything?\" \"Tod,\" Scoot replied, \"I'm Copper's son. Remember me and my sister from the forest? We didn't attack you!\" Finally, Tod was able to piece the situation together. Copper was delighted, having found out the truth. \"You named him after me?\" Copper happily asked. \"Copper...\" \"Tod...\" They both took a moment to catch their breath. \"Copper\", Tod gasped. \"You're a father?\" \"And so are you!\" his friend replied. \"Nice seeing you again pal.\" Tod didn't know what to say. He attacked his childhood friend! He finally stammered out an apology. \"I'm s- sorry Copper,\" Tod said, \"I didn't know it was you.\" The fox sighed, \" I just want to make sure my family's safe.\" \"I understand Tod,\" Copper responded, \"Cap told me you've been through a lot. Umm... I mean little Copper told me. You can't trust us hounds.\" Tod looked at their two sons, happily standing side by side. \"They get along pretty well, don't they\"? \"They're inseparable, Tod,\" replied Copper, \"they really look out for each other. As a matter of fact, your son rescued mine from drowning in a mud puddle.\" \"That's really nice Copper, but,\" Tod pondered for a moment. \"Their friendship can't last. I'm just worried about your hunters getting to my kid, Copper. Remember what happened when we were younger...\" \"You don't have to worry too much, Tod!\" Scoot exclaimed, \"my hunter plays with Cap too! He knows we're friends.\" \"Who is Cap?\" Tod asked. \"oh, I get it! That's a terrible alias Copper! My Copper I mean.\" \"Also Tod, \" Copper added, \"Amos still doesn't like foxes, but he seems to have no problem with Cap hanging out with Scoot.\" Tod was kind of shocked that his old nemesis was actually kind to his child. \"And... Chief?\" Tod asked. \"He won't hurt me, because it would make Scoot mad!\" Cap said. \"So, is the farm safe now?\" Tod questioned, still hardly believing his son, 'I wouldn't think everyone would be so chill now.\" \"Not quite, unfortunately,\" Copper replied, \"sadly there's a hound on our farm who wants to kill you, because he's jealous of me being the best hunting dog, while I'm also friends with you\". Copper paused, then continued, \"you aren't safe Tod. This hound will stop at nothing to get what he wants.\" \"And how do we get rid of him?\" asked Tod, worried. \"Avoid him for the next three months.\" Copper said. \"Oh, that's great advice Copper,\" Tod mocked, \"I just found out that history repeats itself, AND there's a hound trying to kill me and my family. It's been a great day, I'm tellin' ya!\" The four of them didn't notice the young vixen who was watching them from behind a tree. She was listening to every word. We'll be fine dad! I promise!\" Cap said, \"besides, Copper here will help us out. Uhh, right Copper?\" Copper pondered for a moment. \"I want to help you guys, only because I don't want to see you get killed. I don't want to see you get maimed by buster.\" \"Thanks for looking out for us pal!\" Tod said. \"you're still cool, Copper.\" Copper smiled. He finally had his old friend back. The conversation continued. \"Hey Todd, how is your family anyway? I hope your mate doesn't still hate me.\" The fox chuckled, \"they're doing fine! Just taught the little ones how to hunt! And no, Copper, Vixie knows it was all a misunderstanding.\" Tod continued, \"after all, we're all adults now, it's not worth it remembering petty issues in the past\". \"Cap told me you have a daughter too?\" Copper asked. However, his answer was right in front of him, as the white vixen jumped out from her hiding spot. \"Lily?!\" Tod was startled. \"did you follow me here?\" \"Yep! Sure did! I wanted to be mischievous like my brother!\" Cap laughed. \"You'll never take that title from me!\" Copper stared at the vixen in awe. \"Todd... she's... beautiful.\" Lily was mostly white, with parts of her body orange. Her tail was white, with an orange tip. She looked exactly how Cap described: same colors as him, but she was the opposite. \"And I worry for her life,\" Tod saddened, \"her coat is just too special for hunters to pass up\". Scoot also noticed Lily's strange palette. \"My sister's black, and you're mostly white! I wonder if you two would get along—\" \"A girl!?\" Lily happily interrupted, \"You have a sister! I want a hound friend too daddy!\" \"That's a pipe dream kid, \" Tod sadly replied, \"you're endangered outside of the forest.\" \"Dad,\" the Vixen wined, \"you need to loosen your grip! I'll be fin-\" \"I can't lose my children again!\" Tod outburst, tears forming in his eyes. Copper looked at his friend, and Tod gazed back. \"I'm sorry, I just... can't,\" the older fox stammered. \"Come on. Copper, Lily, let's go home. We can't repeat the errors of the past.\" Tod's next line sent Scoot bursting into tears. \"Say goodbye to your friend.\" And like that, Scoot turned into what essentially could be described as a water sprinkler. \"I'm losing my only friend?\" Tod stared at Scoot. Oh kid, it's not your fault! I was the one who couldn't let your dad go. It was hard for me, as it'll be for you. \"I'm sorry.\" Tod and his children started to walk away, but Cap was fighting back. \"What if I don't want to go home?\" Tod stopped and looked at his son. \"I know, little Copper, that you think things will always be this way, and that nothing will change your friendship.\" Scoot winced. Tod continued, \"but after the hunt, your friend will change. He will remember the fun you both had. The laughter, the games. But despite this, he has an allegiance to his master: and that is to kill as much game as possible, and scrape their hide.\" \"That's not true!\" Scoot shouted. \"I don't ever want to hurt your Copper! I don't think my master does either!\" Tod grumbled. This was certainly a difficult situation for him, and Copper realized this. So, Copper came up with a plan. \"Tod, I'm home on the weekends. I could watch after them with Scoot's master. He adores the damn kit! He won't hurt him!\" Tod took a deep breath, then sighed, \"I want to trust you Copper. I really do. If you can watch after them, then maybe we can make this work.\" \"Please, dad?\" Cap pleaded. Tod thought long and hard. But, if it's what his son wanted, and he would be relatively safe, then what was the issue? \"You know what, fine.\" Tod walked toward Copper, and stared into his friend's eyes. \"But if he gets hurt. You'll regret it.\" Wow , thought Scoot, Cap's father is actually pretty serious. With that lovely exchange over, both families returned to their homes. But first, Tod had to have a talk with his son. \"Lily, go home. I need to talk to your brother.\" \"Ok, dad.\" The white kit left for home. Cap was scared. He knew what his father was going to say. He put his head down towards the ground. Tod just looked at his son, with a frown. \"Look, Copper,\" Tod said. \"I'm not mad at you for playing with Scoot.\" Cap put his head up. His father continued, \"I'm mad at you because you lied to me. I thought you were safe in the forest. Then, you almost get torn apart by a hound!?\" Cap looked his father in the eyes, but he remained silent. Tod sighed. \"Do you know why I worry about you so much? You and your sister?\" Cap got all teary-eyed. Tod answered, \"It's because I love you.\" He placed his front leg on Cap's head, and nuzzled him. Cap started crying. \"I don't want you to get hurt Copper. You, your mother and Lily mean everything in the world to me. One day, Copper, you might have a family of your own. You'll be just as overprotective as I am.\" \"I know dad, I know.\" Tod sighed. \"I told you, that your brother and sister died a year before you were born. I don't want you to have the same fate.\" Still, Copper was feeling sad. He knew what was coming. What Tod said Next surprised him though. \"I'm not going to punish you.\" \"Really?\" Whined Cap. \"Really. I think you learned your lesson. Just, please, be careful around your friend, Copper. Please. I don't trust him or his master quite yet.\" \"I'm sorry, Dad.\" \"It's ok, Copper. Now, let's get home!\" The two of them ran home together. No one noticed Buster hiding in the bushes near the bridge that day. He heard and saw the whole conflict. At home, he was pondering on the meeting. What a happy reunion today, aww! For a second, I thought Copper was going to kill Tod. But now... I can kill Tod! And Liam would LOVE that Vixen's coat hanging up on our wall! It's going to be a bloody season! A/N: Hope you guys don't mind me eh... attempting a song next chapter! You'll love it! It's about death! And killing! Buster explains to Cap in grim detail how hunting works, only in edgy song lyrics! Don't miss it![Chapter 14] A/N: Oh God, here we go! This chapter's a little goofy, to take a break from the dark storyline. Chapter 13: Big Trouble in Little Amounts Last Tuesday of March Scoot was woken awake by the sounds of young dogs barking. \"What in the hay?\" His sister was as surprised as he was, \"There are… a lot of them!\" Scoot got up, and peeked outside his dog house. He saw many hounds, and some puppies who weren't quite hunting dogs. Oh nelly. I guess these are my new \"friends\". Meanwhile, Buster had plans. You'd think he'd just march into the forest, and slaughter Tod's family while they were sleeping. But no , he had to toy with his prey first. He finally found what he was looking for in the forest. \"Well Cap,\" Buster questioned, \"what are you doing so far from home, little one?\" \"Why do you care?\" Asked the fox. \"Don't you want to kill me?\" \"Certainly, I do,\" replied the hound. \"but I feel a bit bad for you.\" \"Why would you feel bad for me?\" \"I want to help you Cap. You must know: Scoot is not your friend!\" \"WHAT?!\" Buster sang: ¶ A long time ago, our species lived in peace… Oh, no, thought Cap. ¶ Playing together, they thought the fun would ne-ver cease I think I'll just off myself, thanks Buster. ¶ Till one day Man got ahold ¶ Thought they were ever so bold ¶ Teaching the dogs to kill their friends… \"Hahaha,\" laughed Buster. \"You know what, Cap?\" \"What?\" ¶ The hunt NEVER ENDS! Cap was thrown aback. ¶ You think that little Scoot is your friend? ¶ How cute, how do you think this will end? \"Not very good, kit!\" ¶ For let me tell you a story ¶ That ends bloody and gory ¶ Of Predator… And Prey! \"Pay attention Now!\" ¶ The hound chases the fox to exhaustion ¶ The prey has no time for precaution ¶ The dog tackles the fox ¶ Enjoys it's painful little squawks ¶ Then the hunter ends the game! \"BAM!\" Buster was imitating a gun shot. ¶ Such a shame! Scoot didn't know what was worse: Buster singing, or the story he was conveying. ¶ So, let me help you with your misconception! ¶ So you don't fall for the hound's deception! ¶ I understand that you're sad ¶ How could Scoot be so bad? ¶ Well I guess we need to recap! ¶ So listen closely! Cap! MAKE. IT. STOP! Cap thought . ¶ The hound chases the fox to exhaustion ¶ The prey has no time for precaution ¶ The dog pins down the fox ¶ Enjoys its painful little squawks ¶ Then the hunter ends the game! \"BAM!\" Such a shame! \"Seems like this is too light for you Cap! How about I detail what will happen to you when you're older!\" ¶ The foolish prey tries to meet with his friend ¶ But the predator knows that THE HUNT NEVER ENDS! ¶ He turns you in to his master ¶ If only you could run faster \"But you can't because…\" ¶ Your leg's been chewed off ¶ The hound sniffs and he scoffs ¶ And the hunter enjoys the sight \"AIN'T THAT RIGHT?!\" ¶ Your 'friend' chases you to exhaustion ¶ You had no time for precaution ¶ Old friend rips you apart ¶ He then tears out your heart ¶Then the hunter he shoots! \"BAM!\" ¶ All the work of… lit tle Scoots_ AH HA HA! While Buster was in the forest tormenting Cap with his song, Scoot was trying to make some new friends. He came upon a group of five dogs: four male, one female. \"Howdy fellas! I'm Scoot!\" The five dogs looked up at him. \"Uhm…,\" one of the males, a greyhound said, \"did we ask you?\" Scoot was saddened. No, he was enraged. \"Uhm, excuse me , I'm Copper's son, and I DESERVE to be TREATED with RESPECT!\" However, he knew he was being ignorant. \"I'm sorry,\" he apologized, \"I just want some friends.\" The greyhound couldn't treat Copper's son with disrespect! \"I think I got carried away, Scoot. My name's Gray.\" Scoot was shocked. Now, the hound was being nice to him. \"Come,\" said Gray, \"sit down with us\". Scoot obliged. \"My name's Annie, \"said the female foxhound, \"but just call me Ann!\" \"My name is Killer!\" said a male beagle, \"You better watch it, pup!\" The beagle laughed. \"I'm Thunder!\" said a male husky, \"hear me roar! AWOOOOHHHHH!\" \"And I'm Jet!\" exclaimed the last male dog, a young Great Dane. \"Well, it's nice to meet you guys!\" Scoot declared. \"Say, do you guys like to play… tag?\" \"Heck yeah dude!\" shouted Jet, \"let's get this game on!\" These puppies are cool, thought Scoot. But I worry about Cap…. Nah, he's fine! And so, Scoot played with his newfound friends. Of course, he didn't forget about his fox buddy! But he wasn't too worried right now. \"You see,\" Buster told Cap, \"he's replaced you!\" They were both hiding in the bush, looking out at the group of six puppies, who were laughing and playing. Buster continued, \"He's going to become a different dog hanging out with them Cap. He's going to forget you.\" While Cap didn't believe any words that Buster said, he still started to shed tears. \"And then,\" Buster said, \"you become their prey.\" Buster then walked out of the bush. \"I won't be so kind to you next time, Cap. And you know what that means.\" The fox was alone now. Scoot is my friend, thought Cap , he won't hurt me… His friend's past statements ran through his head. \" I'm not going to hurt you, we're friends, remember?\" \" So, now I'm losing my friend, dad?\" \" He knows we're friends.\" \"That's not true! I don't ever want to hurt your Copper! I don't think my master does either!\" \" Because me and Copper are best friends!\" I need to talk to him… tonight. That night \"Will you stop looking at me like that!\" exclaimed Annie, \"you're creepin' me out Scoots!\" \"Looks like somebody's falling in love!\" jeered Thunder. Scoot was a little embarrassed. \"I'm sorry I can't help that she's beautiful!\" Annie blushed. Scoot continued, \"but it's not love at first sight! We're just puppies!\" Killer laughed. \"Yeah, it's just puppy love!\" He rolled his eyes. \"Nothin' wrong wit dat!\" \"Hey, I got an idea!\" said Gray, \"why don't we show each other our special talents! I'll start!\" Gray got up, and picked up a stick off the ground. He ran to one of the tiki torches dotting Amos' yard. He placed the stick in the fire, and let it catch. He then drove the stick into the ground. \"Pretty neat huh?\" Gray said. \"Ok, I'll go next!\" Annie volunteered. \"I can do cries from different animals. Most notably, the cries of a fox. Pretty useful, since I'm a foxhound after all!\" So, Annie recreated the cry of a fox. That's pretty accurate! Thought Scoot , it sounds like Cap when he was crying for help yesterday! Killer laughed. \"I would show you my talent, but it's my namesake, and frankly, I don't have any animals to tear apart. I do kill quick though! I'm extremely stealthy!\" \"Alright,\" Thunder said. \"I can sneak under any fence, gate, you name it. There is nothing stopping me!\" He chuckled, \"I even got in the game reserve once! Scared the heck out of those critters!\" \"So\", Jet began, \"at night, you can't see me! Since I'm mostly pitch black, I like to hunt at night. They never see me coming!\" \"What about you, Scoot?\" asked Gray. Scoot knew exactly what he was going to show the group, all thanks to his furry friend. \"You guys ever tried climbing trees?\" \"WHAT?!\" The group screamed in surprise. Scoot chuckled, then ran for the closest tree. Using all his speed, he got to the top, before launching himself off the trunk, into the branches. \"It's easy!\" he mocked, before climbing back down. \"Wow!\" Gray exclaimed, \"where'd you learn to do that?\" \"Uhm,\" Scoot mumbled. \"I have a friend that showed me.\" \"Interesting,\" replied Annie. \"What kind of friend can do that?\" \"It's a secret\". Scoot winked. She's so beautiful… Scoot's little group didn't consist of all the young dogs Amos was responsible for. There were around 30 total, and doghouses were spread all over Amos' yard. Luckily, Scoot's was moved near the edge of the forest, and Annie's was right next to his. He wasn't expecting any visitors. It was late at night, and all the puppies were asleep. \" Psst, hey Scoot. \" Scoot opened his eyes. \" Hey Cap! How have you been ?\" Cap's eyes watered. \" We're still friends… aren't we ?\" Scoot was confused, why does Cap think we aren't friends anymore? IS it because I was hanging out with a group of dogs? \" Of course, Copper! you're my best friend! \" Scoot looked around the yard. \" But you have to go now, it's not safe here for you. You might wake up Annie her —\" \" Hey Scoots,\" a female voice whispered, \" too late! Who ya talkin' to?\" And then she peaked out of her doghouse and saw Cap. \"FOX!\" Annie screamed, \"GET THE FO—\" \"Annie, quit it!\" Scoot put his paw over her muzzle, \"It's okay! He's with me.\" Annie and Cap stared down each other. Cap knew what Scoot was thinking. \"Aww, you're protecting me from your new girlfriend!\" Cap teased. \"She is NOT my girlfriend!\" Scoot retorted, \"She's just a friend, ok?\" \"Hahaha!\" Annie laughed. \"You know, Scoots, if the other four find out you're hanging out with a fox, you'll become the laughing stock of the hunt! Then, so much for being the offspring of the great Copper, right!?\" \"Uh, Scoot,\" Cap chuckled. \"You gonna tell her?\" Silence. Cap was having none of it. \"Allow me to introduce myself,\" Cap said, \"you've already seen that Scoot calls me Cap but, that's not my real name.\" \"Really? Then what is it?\" asked Annie, curious. Cap grinned. \"My dad was friends with a hound dog, and he named me after him!\" \"Oh, really?\" questioned Annie. \"What was this hound's name? Cap smiled. \"Copper. My name is Copper.\" Annie couldn't believe it. The great Copper she had heard about had a fox as a friend? \"I don't believe it! One bit!\" \"It's true!\" Scoot interrupted, \"the great Copper has a secret, and Cap told you it! If you want to ask dad tomorrow, then why don't ya? Just ask him who his friend Tod is, and he'll tell ya!\" \"And now I'm friends with Copper's kid!\" Cap exclaimed, \"funny how that works, eh?\" Then, Cap remembered earlier that day. \"If we're… still friends.\" \"CAP!\" Scoot exclaimed, \"We're still friends! What got in your head?\" But scoot had a clue. \"It was Buster, wasn't it? Cap nodded. \"Don't believe a thing he says, Cap!\" The fox shifted his hat 90 degrees. \"Does this look better, ya think?\" Annie laughed. \"Well that was kinda random…\" Scoot said. \"I Had to get that jerk off my mind! Just pretend me turning the hat is like a new page. Forgetting about him.\" replied Cap. \"Or you just wanted to look gangsta!\" exclaimed Annie. The three of them laughed. \"You're alright, Cap,\" Annie beamed. \"You're alright…\". A/N Now that we got that stupid chapter out of the way, its time to get back on track! Also, the talents are complete filler, and will never be mentioned in the story again![Chapter 15] II Chapter 14: Bear Attack! Last Wednesday of March Inside Amos' house Alex and Amos were listening to the radio. We bring you an alert for your area! A truck carrying a large Black Bear to the Philadelphia Zoo, has crashed on the interstate, near exit 266. There is a possibility that the bear is in your area, so for the time being, it is best to stay indoors! Thank you, and stay safe! \"Aww come on, Alex!\" Amos said, \"there is no reason for th' bear t' be here!\" But Alex was worried. \"Grandpa, exit 266 is a mile away from here! That's too darn close! We gotta worry about the dogs!\" Still, Amos was more relaxed. \"It has no reason to come ova' here Alex! Besides, that there bear's gotta be extremel' hungry to eat anythin'!\" \"Well I'm gonna keep an eye on the puppies! When do we train again?\" \"It starts Saturday, Sonny.\" Amos' Backyard \"You ever had a chance to eat chocolate?\" Thunder asked. \"I did! It tastes awesome and makes you really really really really really—\" \"You finished yet?\" asked Gray. The husky pounced on him. \"HYPER!\" he exclaimed. The other four dogs in the group were groaning. \"Ugh,\" said Jet. \"So, YOU'RE the one who kept yelling last night!\" \"Uhh guys,\" Thunder replied. \"I was asleep all night.\" \"Actually,\" Scoot said, \"I was kinda loud last night. I was yelling at the forest. Annie can confirm this. I'm crazy.\" Annie nodded her head. \"Uhhh… mmhm!\" The other four just looked at her like she was crazy. \"So,\" Killer broke the silence, \"did you guys here about the bear that just got lost nearby?\" \"WHAT?!\" \"No way!\" \"You can't be serious!\" \"Yeah!\" The beagle continued. \"Scoot's master was mumbling about it?\" \"Don't be CAH-razy!\" shouted Scoot. \"That bear is probably nowhere near here!\" Cap peaked out of his burrow . There was a large black figure nearby. It wasn't moving toward him though. As a matter of fact, it was heading in the direction of Scoot's home. \"Uhh, Dad?\" Cap startled his father awake. \"Wh- what Copper?\" Questioned Tod. \"There's a large bear, and it's heading toward Scoot and Copper's house.\" \"WHAT!?\" Tod had to see for himself. Running outside of their burrow, he could spot in the distance, the black bear, who was getting further away from them. \"Yeah, that's a problem\". \"So, what do we do? I DON'T WANT SCOOT TO GET EA—\" \"Shhh!\" interrupted Tod. \"Don't wake your mother and sister up!\" Cap had a worried look on his face. \"I don't want my friend to get hurt. And his uh… new friends.\" \"New friends? You mean like other hunting dogs?\" \"Yeah!\" Alright, Tod thought, so it seems like there's some sort of training thing going on at Amos' place. While it's a terrible idea to go there with all the dogs, the bear would be attracted to them if it was hungry. \" Copper, do me a favor.\" \"Yes, dad?\" \"I need you to go warn Scoot and the other Copper about the bear. See if you could get him to make the other dogs leave. When it becomes safe, I'll try to help him take it down.\" \"I'm on it dad!\" The young fox ran toward his friend's home. At Amos' backyard, there was a large table, with all sorts of food on it. It was lunch time, and all the hunters were preparing to sit down. Amos invited Widow Tweed over, and she brought over her famous apple pie. Alex was passing out the main dish: chicken. \"This here chick'n is made right here on th' farm!\" Amos proudly declared. \"Only the fah'nest real meat fo ya rowdy scallywags.\" The guests smiled, then dug in to their food. \"Yeah! It's dee-licious,\" one of the hunters proclaimed. Still, Alex was starting to get worried about the possibility of a bear attack. He secretly fed a chicken wing to Daisy and Shadow, who were lying under the table. I'm so worried about my puppy, Alex thought. Scoot and his group of friends were on the opposite side of the yard, next to the fence that marked the boundary between the Tweed and Slade properties. They were playing around with a tennis ball. Cap was hiding in the bushes. Trying to think of how he could alert Scoot. Luckily for him, Annie was close by. \" Hey! \" Cap whispered. \"Scoot's girlfriend .\" The foxhound searched for where the voice came from, before finally sticking her head in the bush. \"Little fox!? What are you doing here ?\" \" I came to warn you guys.\" \" About what?\" \" Tell Scoot to warn his dad: there's a bear nearby! I saw it!\" \" No way!\" \" You gotta get all the pups inside, Annie!\" \" I'll go tell Copper!\" \" Good! Now go!\" Annie dashed toward the other side of the yard. \"Where ya goin?\" asked Gray. But the foxhound just kept running. Copper was near the barn, and Chief and Buster were with him. Copper smiled as the young hound ran toward him, but his smile quickly changed to a frown, when he saw her worried facial expression. The foxhound spoke, \"Copper, there is a bear coming! You have to get the other dogs to safety!\" Chief laughed at her. \"Haha, I heard about the bear, but there's nothing to worry about!\" \"But… this is different. I know it's nearby.\" Stammered the puppy. \"And how would you know, you could be pranking us,\" Buster mocked. \"Because,\" the foxhound trembled, \"Scoot's little- fox- friend- told me\". That statement made Chief and Buster angry. But Copper remained calm. He walked over to Annie and whispered in her ear. \" So, you know about Cap? Don't mention him around Buster. He wants to kill him.\" Annie nodded. \"Good,\" Copper said. \"Let's warn everyone.\" For the next ten minutes, Copper, Chief and Buster rounded up all the puppies into one area. Except for Scoot's group. They were still playing around with the ball, but Annie was running back towards them. However, as she arrived in the group, they heard a growl in the forest. \"What's that… sound?\" Killer whimpered. Scoot mocked him, \"Oh, come on! Your name is killer, and you're afraid of that which you can't see? You need to—\" Scoot's speech was cut short, as the bear burst through the bushes. \"Uhh... what I meant was, you need to… RUN!\" The group of dogs ran as fast as they could across the yard, but it was no use! The bear stopped them in their tracks. \"FEED MEEEEEEEE!\" The beast screamed, \"I'M HUNGRY!\" The bear swiped at Killer, but it missed. The puppies were scared to death, but they were surprised when the bear stopped clawing at them. Amos saw the bear from the other side of the yard. \"I guess you were right Alex! Get the puppies in the barn!\" \"I've been doing it for the past five minutes, because I didn't believe that this wasn't going to happen!\" Alex mocked. \"Right, then carry on!\" \"I'm almost done Grandpa, except were missing five dogs, Scoot, Copper, and Chief! Why don't you finish, and I'll go save my dog!\" Alex finally took a breath, and ran off. But first, he ran inside to get a special weapon: his tranquilizer rifle, from when he first learned how to hunt. Copper caught the bear off-guard, and bit into its back. He didn't know, however, that Chief followed him. \"Go dad, go!\" Scoot shouted. But, he noticed his dad was having trouble. Luckily for Copper, he had a friend watching the scene from the forest. \"Alright kid,\" Tod told Cap, \"I'm, gonna go help my friend! And you gotta make sure that those puppies don't chase me!\" \"Uhh, da—\" \"There's no time!\" The older fox ran toward the forest exit. Copper lost the grip on the bear, and it started heading for Chief. \"Chief! What are you doing here!\" the bloodhound shouted. Chief was knocked on the ground by the bear. He attempted to get up, but he was weak from the attack. The bear started to close in on him. Chief started to close his eyes, but then something surprised him. At that moment, a streak of red shot across his vision, and rammed into the bear. What the hay? Thought Chief. \"Hey!\" shouted Killer, \"I knew I was smellin' a fox!\" I'm gonna catch—\" Scoot pinned down Killer. \"If you want to survive, Killer, it's best to let that fox live!\" \"You make no sense!\" exclaimed Killer. \"How could a fox of all things possibly help us? They are just game animals that we kill!\" \"Don't be ignorant!\" Scoot yelled. \"That fox is helping my dad take down the bear!\" \"WHAT are you talking about?\" demanded Gray. Scoot sighed, here it goes. \"That fox is my dad's friend.\" And he was! Tod and Copper both latched onto the bear, and through their combined effort, they were both able to bring it down on its stomach. The only problem now, was that the puppies were thinking about attacking Tod… until his son rammed into them! \"Oww!\" Scoot painfully shouted. \"What hit me?\" He was surprised to see his group of friend's snarling at him. No, they were snarling at the creature who landed on top of him. \"It's a fox!\" Screamed Jet, as he attempted to pounce on Cap. This failed however, as Scoot placed his friend on the ground, and covered him from attack. \"What are you doing, Traitor!\" shouted Thunder, \"You are supposed to kill those crazy things!\" Gray had a sadistic idea. \"Alright, so how about us five take a vote, to see if we agree on pouncing on Scoot, and killing that kit! Majority rules!\" Scoot gulped. \"Wh- why, guys?\" Gray started calling names. \"I vote yes. Thunder?\" \"Yep\" \"Jet?\" \"Yes\" \"Killer?\" \"I want to shred that fox!\" \"Ok, Annie?... Annie?\" \"I vote no.\" Gray was conflicted. \"Annie, judging by the fact that you're a foxhound, you are supposed to hunt foxes. So, I'm surprised you said 'no'. Gray smiled. \"You don't want to hurt your boyfriend's feelings… do you?\" \"It's not that, Gray, it's that—\" \"WELL IT'S A FREAKING FOX! Gray angrily shouted. \"YEAH! HE'S A FREAKING FOX! Scoot also angrily shouted, \"BUT I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO TO ME! BECAUSE YOU AREN'T GETTING TO HIM! HE'S MY FRIEND! DEAL WITH IT! YOU AREN'T HURTING COPPER!\" Gray was confused. \"We aren't going to touch your dad, you idiot! We want to get that fox!\" Cap growled, and rolled out from under Scoot. He wanted so bad to yell at the greyhound. \"No, YOU idiot! My name is Copper! After the hound!\" Gray put his paw in front of Cap's face, his nails nearly touching his fur. \"You're cute kid! Likely story, but no matter how cute ya are, you're still just game. He swiped his nail against Cap's forehead, causing blood to leak out. Cap screamed. The other puppies were just watching gray torment the fox. Scoot was getting angry. \"Gray!\" he snarled. \"Stop. Hurting. My. Friend !\" \"It's a fox, Scoot,\" chuckled Killer. \"It's funny watching him bleed.\" Scoot was furious, and his ferocity was only getting worse. He was about to attack Gray, until Annie did it for him. \"Annie?!\" questioned the greyhound. \"You're a traitor too!? What is so special about the damn fox?! Let me at him.\" He groaned. Scoot swiped his paw across Gray's face. Now, he was also bleeding. The greyhound became scared, as he could see the rage in Scoot's eyes. \"You… you're crazy. Why, Scoot? I… don't understand\". Scoot calmed down, though it took a while. \"Listen to me, please. All of you.\" He pleaded. \"Ok… fine. I will.\" Gray sighed. \"I will too…\" trembled Killer. The other four also agreed. Just then, the bear was thrashing about on the ground, desperately trying to grab Tod or Copper. The bear flung Tod from him, leading to him crashing right next to Chief. \"Hey, old friend ,\" mocked the fox. Chief growled at him. \"You don't understand how MUCH I want to TEAR YOU APART!\" Tod chuckled, \"Why would you? I just saved you from getting eaten by a bear!\" Chief was confused. \"You saved… me?\" \"Yep!\" \"Why would you do that?\" The fox got up, and shoved his face in Chief's. \" I'm not like you. \" Tod darted off, back toward the bear, leaving Chief confused. As he did so, Alex was coming to the scene, with the tranquilizer rifle in his hand. I only have one shot at this, thought Alex. Alex aimed directly at the bear, and fired. Perfect hit! The dart pierced into the bear, injecting the fluid into it. The bear fell asleep a couple minutes later. The authorities were on their way, as Amos called them after he got the rest of the puppies in the barn. Alex also had his shotgun, and took it out from behind his back, aiming directly at Tod. \"Don't move little creep!\" \"Oh shoot!\" Copper exclaimed. \"Alex doesn't know that you're Cap's father!\" \"WHAT?!\" Tod Shouted. Copper started barking madly, and running around the yard. This got the attention of Alex, who was distracted just long enough, to allow Tod to escape into the woods. He snuck into the bushes, closely watching his son. Luckily for him, Copper ran back toward Amos, and the confused teen followed him. Scoot was telling his story to the group: My owner's never around! He has school to go to every weekday, and I'm here alone. I was so sad one day, that I ran into these bushes, and I blacked out on the ground. When I woke up, Cap was there staring down at me. He saved me from drowning in mud, as embarrassing as that sounds. I asked if we could become friends, since I had no one to play with. Cap agreed, and we played in the field over here, for the past couple weeks. I told my dad about our meeting, and he told me about how he had a fox friend when he was little. We were able to piece our stories together, and I found out that Cap's father, Tod, is actually my dad's fox friend! Then Cap told me his name was Copper, after my father. Gradually, we figured the backstory out. I found out about his family, and he found out about mine. Even my master likes playing with Cap! Everything was going great… until Buster showed up. He vowed to kill Tod, and now he wants to kill Cap too! He said he has a backstory, on why he wants to, but we don't know why that is! Buster attacked Cap in our new field, which caused our parents to meet again for the first time in a while. Scoot finished his story. \"And now, here we are. I'm defending my old friend from my new friends.\" The other dogs were speechless, even Annie. Cap was the first to break the silence. \"If you're gonna play nice Gray, then all is forgiven.\" \"I… I don't know. I've never actually known a fox before,\" Gray stammered. \"I thought they were evil.\" Annie laughed. \"This little guy is far from evil! You see the cap he wears? How could a cute fox wearing a cap be evil?\" \"Actually,\" Cap interjected, \"there are some pretty mean and stupid foxes out there! I'm just not one of them! For instance, my species can't climb trees, but I was able to learn it from a friend\". Cap smiled, \"I even passed that knowledge down to Scoot!\" \"So, YOU'RE Scoot's secret friend then!\" Thunder exclaimed. \"It all makes sense now!\" Killer spoke, \"you know, Cap, Copper or whatever your name is. I hate saying this but, if you're Scoot's friend, and everyone else is ok with ya, then I'm okay with you too.\" \"Agreed\" said Jet. Cap smirked. \"So, wouldja say we're all friends then?\" Gray laughed. \"I wouldn't go that far, but- sure.\" Jake, Alex's neighbor, was pissed. Not only did he almost get arrested that day, by causing the truck carrying the bear to crash, his attempt to kill his neighbor's puppies failed! One Day, Jake thought, that stupid dog 'Scoot,' will be nothing but a horrible memory.[Chapter 16] II Chapter 15: Liam and Cap Thursday, Last day of March Two days. Just two more days until the hunt training began. Alex was nervous, he was going to train all the puppies on the first day! He needed money, and his grandfather said he would pay him to do it. His father, however, was watching from inside Amos' house, what took place. He saw Cap and Scoot's group of puppies playing with the fox, and being nice to it. That damn fox is going to ruin Alex's hunting dog! He thought. I gotta destroy that kit! Meanwhile, outside his window, the group was playing a rough version of \"duck duck goose\". In this version, the puppies had to wrestle the \"tagger\" to the ground. \"So basically,\" Killer was explaining to Cap, \"the tagger runs around and selects the 'goose', who then tries to attack the tagger. If the tagger gets around the circle and takes the spot, then the goose becomes the new 'tagger'. If not, the tagger has to try again.\" \"Sounds cool!\" Cap declared. \"When do I get to beat ya?\" Thunder laughed. \"I like this fox!\" \"Hey Cap,\" Scoot asked, doesn't your father only want you here on the weekends?\" Cap chuckled. \"Nah, he said if your master was here, you know, because he is so nice to me; I'm allowed to play with you guys.\" \"Works for me!\" Annie exclaimed. \"Let's start this! I'll be the tagger… or goose.\" \"Game on,\" said Cap, pushing the front of his hat down. \"Let's do this!\" Alex was watching the seven of them from across the yard. Looks like they are all playing nice! He thought. Note: The humans are unable to discern that the animals are playing Duck Duck Goose. The order was: Scoot, Annie, Cap, Killer, Thunder, Jet and Gray. They were spread out in a big circle. Annie got up, and started her selection. \"Duck, Duck, Duck, Duck, Duck, Duck, Duck, Duck… GOOSE!\" Annie tapped Killer, and off they went! It only took around 6 seconds to complete a circuit, but they were much faster than humans, so it didn't matter. Killer was unable to catch up to Annie, and she took his spot. \"Heh,\" Killer laughed. \"Now it's my turn! Duck, Duck, Duck, Duck, Duck Goose !\" Killer ran as fast as he could away from Cap, but the fox was too fast! The beagle only got halfway around the circle before he was tackled to the ground. \"Too fast for ya?\" Mocked Cap. Killer chuckled, \"It's cute being successfully hunted by your prey. Guess I gotta go again!\" While Killer started counting again, none of the puppies or the lone fox could see that Alex's father was coming up from behind them. He had one goal in mind. I'm going to break that fox's neck! He thought. Alex watched his father with suspicion. What's he doing over there? he thought. He got his answer, when Liam grabbed Cap's neck from behind, and lifted him high into the air. \"Cap!\" Scoot screamed. \"What is he doing to you?!\" Cap tried to form complete words, but he was being choked. \"He- choki- me \" \"Alright, you little rat!\" Shouted Liam. \"Time to crush your fragil' throat!\" Liam attempted to squeeze Cap, which caused his hat to fall off his head. The fox felt his life fading from him. That was, until a very surprised Alex startled Liam. \"Dad! WHAT ARE YOU DOING!\" The teen exclaimed. \"I'm solving a problem here, Alex!\" Alex looked at his father in shock. \"Solving a problem? Solving a problem?! You're gonna kill the damn thing!\" \"That's the idea! I don't think you or the other hunters want this rodent messing with their hunting capabili—\" \"Wait!\" Alex interrupted, \"Let me get this straight. You're worried about the fox hurting Scoot's ability to hunt? That's complete BS! You just want to kill it!\" \"Alex, this fox could have rabies, and it could bi—\" \"It DOESN'T have rabies, and it WON'T get it! It's vaccinated.\" Liam threw Cap on the ground, thankfully, before he blacked out from lack of oxygen. The older Slade was furious. \"You VACCINATED a damn wild FOX? What is the matter with you boy!?\" 'Uhm, excuse me, Dad. That fox happens to be Scoot's friend! It's why he ran away when I wasn't home. He played with it in the field.\" Liam was speechless. \"And by the way, dad,\" Alex pulled a red hat out of his pocket. He showed it to his father. \"His name is Capper.\" Cap was recovering from lack of oxygen, but he was still aware of Alex putting the new hat on his head. It even had his alias on it in white letters: \"CAPPER\". Alex growled, \"Talk to me again when you're sober.\" Liam stormed off, he was frustrated that his son stopped him from killing a game animal . He was even more mad at the fact that Alex got a custom-made accessory for the pest. Alex knelt on the ground. Cap nuzzled against him, which caused Alex to smile. But Alex's smile faded. \"Looks like I gotta keep an eye on you, Capper.\" Alex stood back up, and Cap walked back to his group of friends. They were not motivated to play after what they just saw. They all looked at Cap. Cap put his head down, and started to cry. \"Did he just try to…\" Gray couldn't finish his sentence. He walked over to comfort Cap. \"It's okay.\" He said. Cap picked his head up and whimpered, \"my life almost- ended! It's not okay!\". Scoot tried to think of something positive. \"Hey, at least ya kind of have a collar now! You know, a hat with your name on it! Cap looked his friend in the eyes. \"Not. In. The. Mood.\" He looked back to see if Alex was still nearby, his 'protector'. Sure enough, he was. \"I just want to go home,\" Cap cried. Scoot thought it was best to let Cap leave, so he escorted Cap into the forest. Will he still come back? Thought Scoot.[Chapter 17] Chapter 16: Hunting Failure Saturday, April 2 Scoot and his friends didn't see Cap at all on Friday. Scoot understood, though, because of what happened Thursday evening. Cap would return the next day, but he wanted a day to not think about being in danger. Unfortunately for him, Alex was training a group of the hunting dogs today, with the help of Copper. The other hunters would form their own groups. The training would go like this: for the next two weekends, Alex and the owners would hunt around the forest with the puppies. Copper would lead Alex's group, and would teach them hunting techniques, and properly demonstrate how to catch game. Whoever came back with the most game, would win a prize. This would go on for three more days: the following Sunday, and the next weekend. Scoot and his friends were ahead of the pack, near Copper. It was almost time to go. Copper told his son the game plan. \"Alright Scoot, listen. We're going to try to stay away from our fox friends as much as possible. So today, we are hunting in the west part of the forest.\" \"Gotcha dad,\" replied Scoot. \"Cap's been absent for a while anyway.\" \"I can see why,\" Copper replied. \"I hope he stays safe\". Alex was having a chat with his group of hunters, whom he knew from school. \"Yo Robbie,\" Alex asked a tanned skin boy, \"you notice how close your dog's Killer, Thunder and my dog Scoot have gotten? \" Yeah, I noticed,\" Rob said. \"They have like their own little group too!\" \"Yeah, said a blonde haired girl, \" your dog and my dogs have gotten really close Alex\". Alex smiled at the girl. This was Kat, a girl he's had a crush on for the past two years. What was funny, was that her female dog Annie, really liked Scoot. \"They're a cute couple, Scoot and Annie.\" He winked at her. Kat blushed. \"Nice try, boy! That's not gonna work on me!\" \" I didn't think it would.\" Alex blushed. \"What are you doing here anyway?\" Kat grumbled, \" my mom signed me up for this. Don't ask why. Its mostly for Jet and Annie.\" \"I'm sorry,\" Alex apologized. \"Don't be. Maybe it'll be fun. Besides, we're hunting right behind Jake's house!\" \"Oh God!\" Exclaimed Rob. \"I can't wait to hear him bitch about it on Monday!\" The three of them laughed. \"Hey, Joshua's puppy Gray is here, is he coming with?\" Asked Rob. \"He told me he'd meet us in the forest!\" Said Kat. \"Alright\", Alex stated, \"Enough chitchats, let's get going!\" Scoot's group, Shadow, and Copper were ready to go! \"Best of luck to you guys!\" Called Chief. They were just about to go, when Buster called Scoot over. \"Yo pipsqueak, come here!\" What does he want? Scoot thought. The dark hound glared at him. \"If you see little Cap today, you better warn him.\" Oh jeez, this again . \"Don't you touch him!\" Buster laughed. \"I intend to end his life, the day after the full moon.\" Scoot attempted to grab onto Buster, but the hound simply flung him off. \"YOU ARE NO MATCH FOR ME!\" Buster growled. \"You got 2 weeks till your friend is lost to the past. Hopefully you became a real hound after this hunt. Then, you can take the glory in killing him! Scoot was cross, he looked buster right in the eyes. \"I'm not going to kill my friend\". He began to walk away. \" But if you hurt him... I will kill you . I'll find a way. Mark my words .\" As Scoot was leaving, he could swear that he heard maniacal laughter behind him. That hound's going to get it one day , thought Scoot. Buster was grinning on the inside. Tick-tock little fox... Widow Tweed, Amos, and Liam were sitting at a long table. They were preparing the dinner for that night, but decided to take a break. Amos knew that Widow didn't like hunting, but she seemed to be fine with it. Surprisingly, Widow was the one who \"started\" this event. It actually isn't all about the hunt training, it's more of a community get-together for a week. Different families bring different food, and some of them bring tents and camp on Amos' Property. The hunt is only for a couple days. \"How've ye been Tweed?\" asked Amos. Widow responded, \"you know why I don't like these hunts, I just worry about the puppies and your grandson, dear.\" \"Alex will be fine,\" Liam stated. \"He's a good kid, but he does stupid stuff sometimes. Like yesterday\". Amos was intrigued. \"What happened yesterday? \" Liam grumbled. \"I tried to kill a young fox on our property, and he went completely apeshit!\" Tweed gasped. Amos had an idea of what he meant. \"Did it wear a cap on it's head?\" \"Y- yes father...?\" Answered Liam, shocked. Amos smiled. \"That's Scoot's lil' friend. Course he wouldn't let ya kill 'm.\" Liam frowned. \"You do know that he vaccinated the damn thing? Against rabies!\"i Amos groaned. \"I didn't know that... but at least now it won't spread disease! That was expensive though...\" Liam said, \" what if it already has it.\" Amos laughed. \"I noticed something about that fox, son! Its extreml' tame!\" He turned to the Widow, who was preparing more pie. \"Tweed, did ya ever give yer critter Tod any shots?\" Tweed was confused, \"When he was a Kit... Why Amos?\" The eldest Slade chuckled. \"That damn cap wearing kit is probably the offspring of your fox!\" Tweed was conflicted. \"You mean Tod's son? There are many foxes out in the forest, why do you think it's his? I also took him to the game reserve, to protect him from you.\" Amos chuckled again. \"Because its tame, hangs around near dogs, and Copper didn't attack it. Which means... Copper actually cares about that damn pest for some reason!\" Liam got up from his chair. \"There will be no damn foxes ruining my son's huntin' dog!\" He went inside to find his shotgun. Scoot and his group were trailing ahead of Alex and his 'friends', sniffing out for any game. \"I sure hope Cap isn't out here!\" Scoot exclaimed. \"Relax\", said Shadow. \"Cap lives north of our home, and we are west right now! The kit's fine!\" But Scoot had a sinking feeling. \"I have a bad feeling about this.\" \"Chill out!\" Said Gray. \"Just keep on eye out for any vermin!\" Buster knew that Cap would be hanging out, dangerously away from home. Cap was trying to hunt mice, to make his dad proud. Buster found the fox, and gave chase. Cap ran as fast as he could, in the direction Buster was chasing him: to the west side of the forest. \"Why don't you leave me alone!\" Exclaimed the fox. Buster replied, \"I made an error when I was younger, Cap! And that mistake is the reason you are alive! I must correct it!\" What is he talking about? Cap thought. Cap kept running, but eventually stopped. In the middle of the danger zone. He didn't realize that Buster tricked him into running in front of the hunt, but he was too late. Buster was giddy with joy. That kit is going to get in trouble, his dad is going to try to rescue him, and Alex will shoot him point blank, haha! Alex and his 3 friends were having a hard time catching up to their puppies. Annie sniffed the ground. \"Raccoon! I found a raccoon!\" \"Let's get 'em Annie!\" Scoot shouted. The group of six chased the raccoon through the forest, breaking into a hilly clearing. Unfortunately for the puppies, the raccoon got away. Scoot couldn't believe his eyes: in the clearing, his fox friend stood, frozen in terror from a beagle puppy growling at him. \"What are you doing here?!\" Scoot cried. \"Go home Cap, you're going to get shot!\" Scoot ran to his friend, who had a look of regret on his face. Cap was frozen. \"He- tricked- me.\" The fox stammered. \"Who tricked you, Cap?\" \"Buster ran me into the path of the hunt.\" That damn dirty no good hound , thought Scoot. \"I can't run back!\" Cap cried. \"The hunters are surrounding this whole field! And this jerk right here pounced on me!\" Scoot glanced at the beagle and growled. The beagle was surprised by their exchange. \"Uhh, I got him first... he's for my master!\" Scoot got between his friend and the Beagle. He growled. \"He's nobody's! Now scram!\" The beagle leapt up and ran away. Scoot's group finally caught up to him. \"Why is he here?\" Asked Gray. \"That Buster jerk chased him in here,\" grunted Scoot. \"We gotta escort him out!\" Thunder giggled. \"Operation fox rescue is a go!\" \"Lame name!\" Chimed Shadow.\"How about mission foxtrot forest\". Cap smacked his paw against his forehead. \"They are both equally dumb names. Can we just go, Team ? Before your people show up?\" Scoot nodded. \"Let's go!\" They got halfway through the clearing, until they heard the distant sounds of young dogs barking. Coming toward them. Gray turned to Cap. \"Look, my friend, in the next couple seconds, you should probably-\" The barking grew closer. \"RUN!\" Screamed Gray. The group could see a pack of hounds and puppies heading straight for them. Cap bolted! Running as fast as his little legs could carry him. He knew this meant life or death. He, unfortunately, lost his hat as he sprinted away from Scoot. \"What the hay is going on!\" Shouted one of the hunters. \"Those dogs are nuts!\" Scoot's group just stared, as multiple puppies, hounds, and their masters ran past them. Cap is going to get killed! Scoot thought. Alex and his group approached the clearing, finally finding their puppies. \"There you are!\" Alex exclaimed. He noticed the group of puppies were somber. \"What's the matter boy?\" He asked Scoot. Scoot whined, and nudged the small red hat on the ground, with his friends alias on it. \"Oh no.\" Said Alex. \"Well find him boy, I promise!\" \"What's going on?\" asked Rob. \"Scoot's little friend is missing,\" whimpered Alex. \"What friend?\" Asked Josh, Gray's owner. \"He's got a little fox friend that wears this Cap.\" \"That's really weird Alex.\" Muttered Kat. \"Hounds hunt foxes though.\" \"Actually,\" Alex said, \"I saw them all playing together yesterday. Before my dad tried to choke the fox to death. We gotta find the little critter.\" Rob groaned. \"I can't Believe we're trying to find a fox, and we aren't killing it!\" \"I know it sounds crazy,\" Alex replied, \"but it's what I wanna do. Come on!\" The other three teens reluctantly followed Alex, in his pursuit for Cap. Wait a second , thought Alex, where's Copper ? Copper was trying his best to run ahead of all the hound dogs, and puppies. He could see the panicked fox, running in front of him. He wanted to call out to him, but he didn't want the fox to waste his breath talking. This was survival, which meant conserving enough energy to run to safety. The chase led them through the forest, across a bridge over the river, and more forest. Cap kept running, he wasn't out of breath just yet. He was the fastest creature in the forest, by a landslide. All those games of tag with Scoot and Shadow were finally put to the test! He just kept running. Eventually, he came upon a large rock wall, and had to turn. He thought if he could run all the way back, he could safely lose the hounds near Scoot's home, and run back to his home. He eventually did another turn, running back in the same direction he came. He tried to remember Scoots hunting techniques. You gotta lose the scent. He came across the river. Perfect! He thought. He jumped in, and swam to the other side. The chase was right behind him, on the other side of the river. It was only a couple feet deep, but it was the width of half a football field. Copper, still hot on Cap's tail, was pleased that the fox was still alive. Only a couple hundred yards to go, Cap! The hounds finally lost track of Cap. He ran into the clearing, catching sight of Alex. He ran as fast as he could, toward him. But, another hound, the beagle from earlier, stopped him in his path. It pounced on Cap. \"Game over, little foxy!\" The beagle mocked. \"You game always think you can get away, huh?\" The beagle howled, calling its master. Copper stared in horror, as the beagle's hunter came up to Cap, and primed his shotgun. All of a sudden, a streak of red dashed across the hunters vision, before he could shoot Cap. The hunter missed. Tod ran towards Copper, carrying Cap in his mouth. \"Tod... Duck!\" Shouted Copper, as the hunter took aim at Tod, fired, but missed due to Copper's early warning. \"I'm gonna git' both of those vermin!\" Shouted the hunter. Now, Alex, his friends, and the group of puppies were near the hunter. What vermin ? Alex thought. Tod, Cap, and Copper hid behind a tree. Cap had tears in his eyes. \"Buster tricked me into running here dad, I'm sorry.\" Tod nuzzled his son. \"It's OK, Copper. I know you aren't that reckless.\" Copper, the hound, was worried. \"They're gonna come straight here guys. What are you going to do.\" Tod's eyes watered. Cap knew what he was going to try to do. Tod closed his eyes. \"I gotta throw them off your trail, son.\" Cap started crying. \"No! You can't do it, dad! Don't sacrifice yourself for me! Please! Don't do it daddy!\" Tod whimpered, \"Cap, it's okay! You got good friends that will take care of you!\" He looked right at Copper. Now Copper was cutting onions. He knew what had to be done. \"Good luck, old friend.\" And like that, Tod sprinted out from behind the hiding spot, putting a target on himself. Fortunately for him, the hunter and his beagle left. Unfortunately for him, Alex was nearby, with Scoot and his friends. \"Tod?!\" Screamed Scoot. Alex started taking shots at Tod, missing because the fox was moving too quickly. Scoot had an idea. \"Everyone! Pin that fox down! Then stand in front of him! Make it look like we're attacking him, but don't let them get a shot in!\" His group tackled Tod, who lost the desire to live, which made it easier. So now, they could pretend to have caught him. Copper thought for a moment. Your life has been hell up to this point, Tod! I've said it before: I don't want to see you get killed! And damn it, I'm not letting that happen! Copper stormed out into the clearing, with Cap right behind him. Just as Alex was about to unload his shotgun into the red fox, Cap jumped on top of him. Alex was surprised by the sudden 'attack'. \"Is that the fox you were talking about?\" Asked Kat. \"I think so! Is that you Cap?\" Alex asked the startled fox. Cap buried his head under Alex's arm. \"I think that's him.\" \"Uhh, we got a problem here, Alex!\" Joshua stated. \"I can't shoot this fox, because Copper's in the way.\" Rob grabbed Copper, and dragged him out of the way. Copper was so surprised by being moved out of the way, that he didn't have time to protect Tod from the line of fire. The red fox glared at Alex, who was raising his shotgun. \"You're beautiful.\" Said Alex. \"I'm sorry\". But the young kit jumping from his arms stopped him from pulling the trigger. Cap ran to his dad, and rubbed his head against his fur. \"Woah!\" exclaimed Kat. \"The little guy has family here, it seems\". Is this Cap's father ? Thought Alex. He looked at Copper. Copper tried to protect him. That means that... NO! It can't be! Copper protected a fox, from grandpa before. Alex lowered his shotgun. He called to the fox. He knew who he was dealing with. \" T- Tod?\" The red fox sat up, and confusedly stared at Alex. \"No way! You- you responded!\" Alex Stammered. \"You're Capper's father?\" He glanced over to Copper. \"Or should I say, Copper's father?\" \"What are you talking about?\" Interrogated Kat. Alex looked her in the eyes. \"This sounds crazy, but Copper saved that fox from my grandfather a year or so ago. As it turns out\". Alex laughed. \" There's a history in my family of foxes befriending hounds.\" The other two were confused. Alex noticed. \"I'll explain when we get back home, but we gotta get these two fellas outta here!\" Alex walked toward Tod with arms open. \"Come on Tod, I'm gonna take you to safety.\" Copper said to Tod, \"He'll take you away from here, Tod. Just jump in his arms!\" Tod was frozen. \"He- just tried to kill me!\" \"Until he knew we were related!\" Cap pointed out. \"Trust me, dad. He'll help us. Reluctantly, Tod let Alex pick him up. \" I got ya buddy\" Alex said. He patted the fox. \"Sorry bout trying to kill ya earlier! I hope this makes up for it.\" Alex looked down toward Cap, who rolled to pick his hat off the ground. \"You just stay with your group of puppy friends! We gotta hurry though! The other hunters will be back!\" Alex's friends still thought he was a little crazy to be helping out a fox family, but they gave him the benefit of the doubt. He would give them answers soon. Alex's group didn't get any game today, but he was overexcited to explain what happened in the forest that day, to his grandfather. All the pieces of the puzzle come together, Alex thought. Copper glanced to Tod, who was being carried in Alex's arms. \"Still don't trust him?\" His friend grinned. \"Nope.\" A/N Chapter release will be slow for the last remaining chapters of this part. I wrote this a month ago, real life has gotten in the way of proofreading and drafting. Part 2 will be finished before August, but part three and the finale will take a couple months. Your feedback is always welcome. Thank you.[Chapter 18] II Chapter 17: Piecing it all Together Saturday Night Before Alex went to talk to his grandfather, he dropped off the two foxes behind his yard. He could have sworn that they each nodded their head before they departed. These animals are really weird. His friends lived closeby, so they left their puppies in the yard, and went home. Alex waited until his father was asleep, as he knew he didn't like the kit. He found Amos on his porch. \"What da ya want, Sonny?\" Amos inquired. Alex took a deep breath. \"I gotta talk to you... about our dogs.\" He sat down beside him. \"What do ya mean, Alex?\" \"Well, you know how my puppy plays with that little fox 'Cap'?\" Amos grumbled. \"Ya, I know bout it. Why should ah' care?\" Alex sighed. \"That kit is Tod's kid.\" \"What?!\" \"When we were hunting today, Cap was found on the hill behind Jake's house. A fox was going crazy, and our group of puppies took him down. But they didn't let me kill it.\" Amos was intrigued. \"Go on\". \"Copper tried to stop me from shooting it, so Robbie moved him out of the way. That's when Cap jumped out of my arms and nuzzled against his dad. I thought it was crazy, then I realized why Copper tried to stop me from shooting it. So, I called out to the fox. 'Tod,' I said. The fox responded by staring at me.\" Alex paused, and looked his grandfather right in the eyes. \"Copper and Tod's children are friends, just like they were.\" \"Nonsense!\" Amos laughed. \"Foxes and hounds aren't friends—\" \"Cap and Scoot's friendship proves you wrong, grandpa. I'm also inclined to believe that fox's name is Copper. It seems crazy, I know, but that kit got really giddy when I called him 'Capper'. Maybe Tod named him after Copper?\" Amos pondered. \"So, what you're sayin' is this problem of ours has been goin' on for a while, eh?\" Alex was taken aback. \"Uhh- I don't think it's a problem grandpa. It's just odd. Copper and Scoot are kind to those foxes. Ain't nothin' much we can do about it. These animals are smart in their own special way. If the kit thought he was in danger, he wouldn't be hanging out with the hounds. Heck, even my friend's puppies got along with em!\" \"Alex,\" Amos sighed, \"I'm gonna give ya the whole story. Yes, Tod was the one who caused Chief to break his leg. The damn fox was running on the railroad bridge, and a train neared. The fox ducked under the train. Chief however, did not, and he fell down to the shallow riverbed. Luckily, he was still alive. Copper growled at that fox. It was obvious he wanted him dead. This is where I am unable to believe the 'friendship' you believe Copper and Tod have together. Anyways, Widow took her fox to the game reserve, and I planned with Copper how to get that fox. A week later, we snuck into the game reserve, and started pursuing that critter. Turns out, it had found a mate! I was out for revenge, so killing her too would have given justice!\" Amos paused. \" But then, a bear attacked me and Copper. I fell into my own trap. The bear went to end Copper, but it was attacked by that fox. I don't understand why it would do such a thing. Copper was out to kill it. I got out of my trap, and limped to the bottom of the lake, where the fox, broken and defeated, was crawling toward the shore. What I found odd, was that Copper stared at the poor thing, and didn't attack it. That was, until I raised my shotgun to the fox's head. It cowered before me, and stared in horror, as I was about to end it's life. You know what happened after. \" \"You're- kind of a bad person, Grandpa. Trying to kill the poor thing\". Alex stated. \"It was a stupid idea of mine, Alex. But like I said, Copper didn't let me kill it. And now, here we are. I don't hate Tod as much as I did before, Sonny. That fox taught me how revenge isn't the best medicine to a problem. I feel like I owe that damn thing. However, I in no way, like that fact.\" Alex thought for a moment. He now knew the full story of what happened, or at least, what Amos knew. He had a sneaking suspicion on the real reason why Copper didn't let his grandfather kill Tod. \"Grandpa, hear me out, I want to tell you my theory as to why Copper didn't let you kill the fox.\" Amos groaned. \"If it's about tha 'frien'ship' thing, ah' don't wanna hear it!\" \"But grandpa,\" Alex pleaded, \"I have a good reason to believe it. Just hear me out, ok?\" His grandfather looked at the clock. I guess it wouldn't hurt to waste more time, now would it? \"Fine Alex, what's yer story?\" Alex began. \"My puppy and Cap are friends, and they are still young. I don't think they would get along well if they were older. It's kinda like how dogs and cats will be friendly to each other, if they were raised together young. So, I'm wondering, do you think that Copper and Tod played together when they were little?\" \"No, ah don't Alex!\" \"Well, here's something for ya, grandpa: I spoke to the widow the other day, and asked her about her fox, and where she kept it. She said Tod would get out sometimes, and wander to the pond. What do you think about this, grandpa? Did Copper ever wander by the lake when he was a puppy?\" Amos grumbled. \"Yes.\" \"So, what do you think he was doing, grandpa? Because I'll tell you what I think he was doing: he was playin' with Tod! Amos thought for a minute. \"Well, there was this here one tahm ah' leashed Copper to his doghouse. That same day, that fox was on my property, bothering Chief.\" Alex smiled. \"Do you know why, that fox was on your property?\" \"Of course, Alex! He was trying ta kill mah chickens!\" Alex shook his head. \"Nope! It's because he wanted to play with Copper!\" Amos had a headache. \"This dumb rhetoric is hurting my head, Alex! Finish your piece, so I can go to bed.\" Just one more scenario, to prove my theory ! Alex thought. \"Hey grandpa, you remember that bear that attacked a couple days ago?\" Amos nodded. Alex continued. \"I saw that fox wrestle the bear with Copper, and I was able to put it to sleep! I almost shot the fox though. But I wonder, why would Tod try to take down a bear, that was on our property.\" \"Oh, I don't know Alex! Why would Tod attack the bear?\" Amos sarcastically remarked. Alex sighed. \"It isn't that hard to believe grandpa, but Cap cares about Scoot, and Tod didn't want to see Copper, his friend, or his son, Scoot, to get hurt. Maybe one day you'll understand why I think this is the case.\" Alex got up from his seat, and paced back and forth. \"You know, this whole fox and hound thing is so interesting. I wonder how they feel about breaking the rules of nature.\" \"You need to take a nap or something, Sonny,\" Amos groggily replied. \"Get this out of your head\". \"I'm not going to get it out of my head!\" Alex retorted. \"This is happening, whether you like it or not. I wanna see how they interact. What goes through the minds of these animals that we don't know about?\" Alex ran down Amos' porch, and headed home. That kid is crazy, Amos thought. A/N: Two chapters added today, as this one is kinda short.[Chapter 19] II Chapter 18: Frolicking around the Forest Monday, April 4 Monday Morning. It meant Alex was back in school, and the dogs were home alone, including Copper, who was sleeping. Scoot and his friends decided to sneak into the forest to meet up with their orange furred friend. He wanted to show them something. \"Hurry up guys!\" shouted Scoot, who was running toward the woods. \"We gotta hurry before Buster gets back!\" The rest of the puppies were behind, with Shadow last. \"I can't run as fast as you, bro!\" she Said. Scoot laughed. \"It'll be worse when ya have to catch up to Copper!\" Shadow groaned. She wasn't as fit as her brother was, and she definitely wasn't fast enough to catch up to the fastest critter, of whom she knew. However, she endured the trip, as she arrived, exhausted, to their meeting place, which was deep in the forest. Cap was waiting for them. Cap mocked, \"geez, you guys took forever! I almost fell asleep waitin' for ya'll to finally show up!\" He laughed. Grey was displeased. \"Enough of the mockery, Cap. Where we going today?\" Cap smirked. \"We're going to a place that's forbidden to you hounds! Deep in the forest. Beautiful place though, you'll like it!\" He turned to Scoot. \"You'll recognize it when we get there, though you've never seen it. Come on!\" Cap started running towards his destination. The puppies reluctantly followed. Shadow was annoyed. Scoot was puzzled. What does he mean? The puppies didn't have too much trouble keeping up, but Shadow still was. \"Hey Cap!\" Shadow screamed. \"Can you slow down a bit? I can't keep up!\" Cap stopped dead in his tracks, causing the other seven to also stop. Cap growled. \"Fine! But only because you're my best friend's sister! But I'm only slowing down a little bit.\" He continued running, but at a little slower of a pace. The puppies followed. They ran through the forest for around five minutes. Scoot was getting worried. \"Uhh, Cap, we're kinda far now. Are we almost there?\" They came up to a fence. Cap smirked. \"We're here alright!\" He ducked through a gap in the fence. \"I wonder who made that hole!\" the puppies followed, for what seemed like another five minutes. The fox and hounds came up to a lake. The fox sat down, and stared at the nearby waterfall. \"Welcome home,\" he said. Liam Slade was rustling through his hunting storage. He retrieved a revolver, and a couple boxes of ammo, of which he stored in his satchel. He had a mission today, while his son was at school. He had to hurry though, as Alex only had one class today. He walked outside, and locked his house up. He whistled. \"Buster! We got a rodent to catch!\" The dark hound appeared from behind, waiting for his master's next command. \"We got a no good fox to catch today\". He loaded his revolver, as they both ran towards the woods. The puppies and Cap were laying on the bed of the lake. \"This is your home?\" asked Annie. Cap sighed. \"For the first couple weeks of my life. But there was no food here, so we had to move. You see, this is a game preserve: no hunting is allowed here. The only reason we could get in here, through that gap, was because Copper and Scoot's master's grandfather came through here.\" \"B- But\" Killer stammered. \"Why would they break the law to come in here? Cap smiled. \"To kill my parents.\" Suddenly, Scoot knew where they were, \"This is where my dad saved yours, isn't it?\" Cap nodded. \"Right on this pond. It's a nice place though, isn't it?\" Shadow lit up. \"Yeah! It's beautiful! I guess it was worth it to chase you all the way here!\" The fox grinned. \"Wasn't really a chase! You couldn't keep up!\" Shadow frowned, but before she could respond, Scoot talked. \"Yo, Cap. This is nice and all, but we gotta be back before Buster notices! Thanks for showing us though!\" Cap got up and stretched. \"Yeah, I'll show you guys how to get home. Also, my dad probably wouldn't be happy knowing I showed you this.\" The group of eight were now on the other side of the fence: the normal northern forest. The puppies knew the direction home now, so Cap decided to trail behind. When they were halfway home, Cap tripped on a rock, and lost the group. They know how to get home now, he thought. Something didn't feel right though. Cap decided to take a couple steps west of his position. He heard the rustling of leaves, and footsteps. Footsteps. Cap huddled against the tree next to him. This can't be good. Before he had time to react, he heard the snarling of a hound, and the cocking of a weapon. No! \" I know you're around here, you little pest! My hound smells you!\" said a masculine voice. Cap heard the footsteps directly behind him. Oh, screw it! There's no better chance to escape! He darted forward, as a gunshot rang out. \"I'll get you little fox! I'm not going to let you ruin my son's huntin' dog!\" Cap ran as fast as he could, luckily dodging the next couple bullets whizzing his way. He came upon a tree, and quickly ran up it. \"I'll wait for you to come down, rodent!\" the voice said. Cap peaked down, just enough so that his assailant couldn't see him. However, their hound dog could. It laughed at him. \"You'll eventually have to come down here, Copper ! And when you do, it's lights out for you, and Tod! Ahahaha!\" It was Buster. Cap thought of a strategy. Those idiots don't know that I can just run across the treeline! As silent as he could he hopped from tree to tree, every so often checking below him, to make sure he wasn't being tracked. After making it across a dozen or so trees, Cap quickly climbed down. When he arrived at the bottom, he peeked around the corner. Phew! Looks like they didn't follow me! He rested against the tree. Laughter was heard, along with a deep voice. \"Did you really think you could get away that easily? I thought Copper said you were smart! \" Cap's predator pounced on him. He tried to wriggle free, but it was no use! He heard the click of a gun. \"Heheh, good boy Buster!\" The barrel of the revolver was shoved against Cap's head, who continued to struggle. Liam crawled closer to Cap, a mere foot from his face. \"My son would be so pissed if he found out what I'm about to do to you! Good thing he came home to sleep!\" Liam reached into his pocket, and pulled out a pocket knife. Buster smiled. \"Is he gonna skewer you? Who knows, haha, Liam is pretty random with his torture methods\". Liam shouted, \"Buster, off!\" The hound was confused, but got off of Cap, who was too frightened to move. The hunter flicked the blade open, and jammed it straight into Cap's front right paw. Blood spurted out like a fountain. Cap screamed, which annoyed the hunter, so he slapped Cap across the face. \"I guess you won't be able to run away now, huh?\" Liam mocked a sad face. \"I think Scoot's going to miss his wittle foxy fwend.\" Liam retracted the blade, which cause Cap to scream again. This time, Liam grabbed him by the neck. \"Oh, I can't kill you! Not just yet!\" The hunter walked toward the pond. \"This is where you and Scoot played, huh? I'd recommend you'd hold your breath, but you dumb animals don't understand english.\" Liam Slade dropped Cap on the ground, and took out a pair of gloves. \"Maybe if I didn't drink so much, I'd have given you a quick death by now, but this is more fun.\" He grabbed Cap by the neck again, and held his head above the water. Cap tried to bite his hand. The hunter laughed. \"Supposedly my dumb ass son vaccinated you, but I ain't taking any chances, so try to bite me.\" He jerked Cap's head forward, and held it underwater. \"It will be the last mistake you make in your life!\" Cap's mind was racing. He was losing oxygen, and his front paw was burning. There was simply nothing he could do. He prayed that either Scoot found him, or that the hunter would show some kindness and end his misery. To his surprise, Liam jerked his head out of the water! Liam noticed the fox was trying to catch it's breath. \"That was only round one!\" He pushed Cap's head under the water, for a second time. Through the distortion of the water, Cap could hear Buster laughing. Cap's head was lifted above the water again. Liam turned Cap around to face him. Liam moved his free hand toward Cap's head, and Cap closed his eyes, expecting another lashing. Instead, a weight was removed from his head. The hunter chuckled. \"Capper, huh? My son actually thinks you wild rodent has a name! Isn't that cute!\" Liam placed the soaking wet hat back on Cap's head. \"I think you've been through enough, don't you think? This time, I'm not removing your head from the water until I feel the life drain from your body!\" But before Liam did so, Copper came crashing through the bushes, curious what the commotion was all about. Then he saw Cap, nearly finished off by Buster and Liam. Angrily, he walked toward Liam. But Liam smiled. \"You wanna finish this little guy off, Copper?\" The hunter questioned. \"Let's see you tear him limb from limb!\" Liam dropped Cap on the ground. Buster was displeased. \"You better kill him, pal. He's only going to suffer if you don't.\" Copper nodded, which horrified Cap. Copper didn't speak one word, he just silently moved toward the injured fox. Liam and Buster watched from the sidelines. As Copper hovered over Cap, the fox closed his eyes. \"Copper, please... Make- it- quick\" Cap whimpered. Still, silent, Copper opened his jaws, and latched onto the back of Cap's neck. Buster chuckled at the sight. Copper had other plans though. As quick as he could, Copper picked up Cap by the scruff of his neck, and took off toward his home. \"I don't believe it!\" Shouted Liam, behind Copper. Buster loudly growled. Copper ran toward Alex's home. He dropped Cap off on the ground, who yelped in pain. Copper barked and howled. Eventually, Alex opened his door, and Copper ran away toward's Scoot. \"What has gotten into you Copper?\" Alex questioned. \"Silly dog, randomly wakes peopl-\" and then he saw Cap on the floor. \"What happened to you, little Copper?\" He grabbed Cap off the ground, and cradled him in his arms. \"I think I might be able to fix you up!\" Buster was furious. His and Liam's attempt to kill Cap had failed . He was so close too! But a calming thought crossed his mind. Tod will look for his son today, and when he does, I will make sure he dies![Chapter 20] II Chapter 19: All a Misunderstanding Alex took Cap upstairs, to his room. He was careful to make sure his father wasn't home. Once he entered his room, he locked the door. He then lay the injured fox on his rug. \"Oh Man... what happened to you, Copper? Your front paw is all torn up! What the...\" When he saw the knife slit, he was enraged. \"This explains everything!\" He angrily shouted, as he wrapped some cloth atound the wound. The fox winced at the pain, but understood that Alex was trying to make it better. When he was finished wrapping the cloth up, he grabbed Cap off the ground, and held him in his arms, while rubbing his back. \"My dad did this to you, didn't he?\" Alex sadly asked. \"He almost killed you I bet.\" He looked out the window. \"You were probably just mindin' your own business, and there he was!\" Cap whined, he wanted to be let go of. \"I'll take you back outside, we just gotta make sure it's safe!\" Alex opened the door to his bedroom, and snuck down the stairs, with Cap in his grip. Slowly but surely, he made it to his back door, where he could see his dad, still outside. He could also see Buster. The little fox still squirmed in his arm. Alex brought the foxes face to his eye level. \"Look kid, I can't let you out right here! That stupid dog will get you! So I'm going to let you go by the Widow's fence.\" Alex did his best to sneak around the back of their yards, along the shadows, where no one could see them. Tod was sprinting through the woods, frantically looking for clues as to where his son could be. Running past the pond, he could spot the group of seven puppies. He walked into their conversation. \"And that's why we don't go near Shady Grove Cemetery!\" Exclaimed Shadow. \"We got company! It's a fox!\" Shouted Killer. \"What do you want, rodent?\" Tod bore his fangs. \"Killer! It's Caps dad!\" Scoot explained. Killer lost his rude demeanor. \"Uhh, sorry sir. You know how us hounds can be...\". Tod just shook his head. Pardon kids,\" he Sighed, \"have you guys seen my Copper anywhere? I know you guys went somewhere today, but he's not with you.\" \"No, Tod,\" Scoot said, he left us in the middle of the forest. We ran the rest of the way back!\" Tod groaned. How would he find his son now? He scanned the farm, and saw Alex walking around with something. No, someone! It was Cap! Tod still didn't trust Alex fully, but he knew his son was safe with him. Then, everything went South. Buster barked madly at Alex, while running after him. In his surprise, he dropped the fox on the ground, causing the young animal to yelp. Buster now had his target. \"NO!\" Shouted Tod, which caused Buster to glance over, drooling, with hate in his eyes. The hound continued to run after Cap, who could barely hobble away. Buster lunged for his prey, but found his body thrown rightward. Buster collapsed on the ground, closely watching his attacker. \"You won't win this, Tod!\" He howled, signaling Liam to come over. Buster forced himself back to his feet, and ran for Cap. Instead, he ran into Scoot. \"Even more betrayal, I see!\" Buster teased. \"Now, move out of the way!\" Scoot gritted his teeth. \"Screw you!\" Buster, ready to pounce on Scoot insisted, \"then I'll kill both of you!\" Tod leapt on top of Buster again, this time pinning him to the ground. \"You aren't hurtin anyone!\" As much as Buster tried, he was unable to get out of Tod's grip! \"How is this possible?\" \"Cause you're a weakling of a hound!\" Tod growled. \"Thinking you can boss other around because of your big and scary ego. In reality, you're pathetically weak.\" Copper was watching from a distance, completely floored that Tod was holding down Buster. He knew he had to take action though, when Liam started heading for the scuffle. Buster laughed. \"You're going to get shot, Tod. And when you do, that Kit will be mine!\" Tod tightened his hold. \"You won't touch Copper!\" The sound of footsteps made him freeze. \"Well, what do we have here? A fox holding down a hound?\" It was Liam. Alex was looking for Cap, but found him in Scoot's safety. Liam took a step closer toward Tod and Buster. He took out his revolver. \"I'm gonna need you to get off my dog, or you're gonna have a high price to pay.\" He aimed the gun at Tod's forehead. \"1, 2...\" When he got to two, Copper charged in front of Liam, blocking him. \"Move out of the way, ol Mutt!\" Copper didn't move. Alex was watching from the side. Copper was protecting Tod again. His heart sank, when he heard his grandfather's back door open behind him. He watched, as Amos carried his shotgun in hand, thinking the retired Hunter would end the Fox's life. Liam grabbed Copper out of the way. \"Don't you EVER get in the way of game, ya hear me?\" He slapped Copper across the face, causing him to whine. What surprised him, however, was that this caused the fox to growl as well. \"Why would you care about your predator? Stupid fox.\" What surprised them all, was when they heard the clicking of a shotgun. Tod tilted his head, and in horror, realized that Amos had his gun pointed right at his skull. The older Slade laughed maniacally. His son was confused on why he wanted to kill the fox. Amos smiled at the fox. \"Been a while, ol' frien!\" He walked toward Tod, and dragged him off Buster, who was exhausted. He wrapped his arm around the fox. Amos still had his shotgun aimed at Tod. \"You've had a nice life out there it seems, away in nature, free from harm\". He pet Tod's head, the fox was too shocked to care. \"You've even created more problems for me to deal with.\" He pointed at Cap, who was being held by Alex. \"And yet, we meet again, almost like destiny.\" Amos patted Tod's fur. \"You're still game to me, and you would make a nice coat, as would your kid. But I would make someone I care about angry, if I were to kill you. Do I really have to take you out, Tod?\" He leaned in toward Tod, so that they were eye level. \"I hate you, so much, you pest! I am so close to letting go of this trigger!\" His outburst shook Tod. All eyes were on the two of them. Amos calmed down, and lowered his shotgun, confusing the fox and Liam. \"However, I believe I owe you one, for my greedy attempt at killing you last year.\" Amos walked over, and grabbed Cap from Alex. He threw him in front of Tod. Tod stared at Amos in confusion. Amos noticed and screamed at the fox. \"LEAVE! And NEVER come back!\" With that warning, Tod grabbed Cap and took off toward the forest, Amos firing his shotgun as a warning. Liam was in shock: he just saw his father talk to a fox and let it escape. \"What the hell is going on with you, you just let a perfectly fine coat get away!\" Amos glared at Liam. He was mad at him, for harming Copper. No one messed with his hounds. He grabbed his son by the collar of his shirt. \"First of all, you don't dare touch Copper!\" He let Liam go, catching his breath. \"And that fox is none of your damn business! Next time, I'll shoot it, but I owe the damn thing a break!\" Alex walked over, also enraged at Liam. He scowled at him. \"Why did you stab Cap?\" Amos was interested. \"What now, Sonny?\" Alex gritted his teeth. \"He stabbed that little kit in the paw\". Liam, unsure of what the deal was rolled his eyes. \"It's game, who cares.\" This made Alex even more angry. He grabbed his father's arm and squeezed. \"It's game, so be respectful and kill it fast! How would you like to be stabbed in the arm before your predator killed you. It's torture!\" Alex paused. Amos knew this signaled a long outburst. \"That fox did nothing to harm you! You just wanna be a huge asshole because my puppy likes playing with it! You want to take your rage out on nature, because you think killing animals will somehow avenge mom!\" Liam tensed. Alex rarely talked about his mother. He was seriously pissed off. The boy continued, with tears streaming down his face. \"Well guess what, dad. Mom had a horrible death. We all know that. We didn't know there would be bears so close to the damn trail! Accidents happen, and they can be fatal.\" Alex paused to catch his breath, but he was no where near finished. \",,But you know what? I don't approve of you getting drunk and trying to kill an innocent creature, who is a baby by the way, just to solve a problem that never existed! A creature that I am quite fond of, due to it's tameness and it's relations with my dog. It's not going to screw up Scoot's hunting abilities, look at Copper! And that's a story for another day, since you have no idea what I'm talking about. Didn't you notice Copper didn't attack the fox? He didn't attack Cap, or his father, Tod? He's the best damn hunting dog around here, and he STILL didn't attack the foxes. Get a frickin clue!\" Both the older Slade's we're shocked. But Alex didn't stop. He chuckled, angrily. \" And you know what? The damn fox's name is Copper! It responds whenever you say it's name! Like when I was bandaging the knife wound you had to create! That stupid fox that grandpa nearly killed actually named the kit after Copper. But their fox's, you may say? Well, they act like fuggin dogs, and respond to their names. They have more decency than you, despite being game animals. But they aren't the real animal.\" He glared at his father. He let go of his wrist. Liam was frozen in fear, still a little drunk. \"I'm going inside. I can't look at your face,\" Alex said. \"Talk to me when you sober up.\" Alex left, and Liam turned to his father, who simply shook his head. It was going to be a long week. That night, Cap was in his families burrow, bawling his eyes out. His sister and mother tried to comfort him, while his father blankly stared out at the landscape ahead of him, pondering what he should do. He knew his son wouldn't take lightly to him being separated from his \"best friend\", but that was the reality of the situation. Tod knew that from his experience with Copper. One thing was for certain though: Cap and Scoot's friendship was much stronger than their parent's. They already knew each other for a far longer time period. Nothing his family could do would stop Cap from crying though. \"Come on bro, ya gotta be stronger than that,\" Lily chided. Cap retorted, \" I literally just lost my best friend. Don't tell me to be stronger!\" \"Son,\" his mother replied, \" You know eventually you couldn't always be friends with a hound! You should be grateful that you had the opportunity to spend time with him! Remember who he is now, not what he will become.\" Vixie nuzzled her son. \"I know it's true!\" Cap cried, \" but I guess I'm not strong enough to face that reality!\" He sobbed into his mother's fur. Back outside, Tod got a visit from an old friend. \"Hey Big Mama.\" \"Oh, hello Tod. What seems to be bothering you?\" Tod tilted his head toward the Owl, but she understood immediately, before he even spoke. \"It's family issues, isn't it honey?\" \"I... Guess so. My son is exiled from seeing his friend.\" Big Mama thought for a moment. \"It's that white and brown spotted puppy, isn't it?\" Tod nodded. \"You know Tod, it's not that different from you and Copper. The hunter catches the fox and BAM! Elimination-\" \"Lack of education\" Tod finished. \"But the puppies hunter doesn't want to hurt my son. I saw them trying to save my son from one of their vicious hounds.\" \"Well, that certainly is a bit different honey. I'd say, if you feel safe, maybe try to rearrange with that puppies parent to see if they can say goodbye, properly.\" Tod sighed. \"I'm not worried about the kid's parent. It's Copper anyway.\" \"You mean that puppies father is your so called friend from yesteryear? The one who invaded your home to try and end your's and Vixie's life?\" Tod sadly nodded. \"Coppers not like he once was. He's a lot more accepting of us now. I have no worries about the dog. I guess you could say, he's been a pretty good \"friend\" for keeping little Copper out of trouble.\" Big Mama smiled. \"Well maybe you should arrange a final meeting with your kids. You never got to say goodbye to your friend before he changed. Give your son the opportunity to. Do what you think is right.\" Big Mama flew off, upon ending her statement. It was dark out, but Tod had a mission to carry out. He made sure his family was fast asleep, then he started heading south. All lights on the Slade property were off, the only light coming from the street. Tod moved towards Copper's doghouse. The hound was awake. \"I know you're there, Tod. Don't make the same mistake you did in our younger years.\" Copper whispered, as not to wake up Chief and Daisy, who were in the doghouses next to him. Tod's eyes met his. \"This is about our children Copper. Is... Scoot... Doing okay?\" The hound frowned. \"He's still upset, Tod. He lost his friend. But what could we possibly do?\" Chief was actually awake, listening to the conversation. Tod breathed deeply. \"Why don't we have a final Meetup?' Copper was confused. \"Uhh, what?\" Tod sighed. \"Let our kids say goodbye. One last time. Somewhere safe.\" Chief crawled slowly out of his doghouse, unbeknownst to the fox and hound. Copper realized that this might be a good plan. It might be easier to wean Scoot and Cap away from each other, with one last day to see each other. \"We could do that Tod. One day. When Buster's away.\" \"Ya gotta worry about me, then.\" Tod snapped his head to the side, and there was Chief, ready to pounce on the fox. \"I don't want to fight you,\" whimpered Tod. \"Maybe I don't want to fight!\" Chief sneered. \"It was funny watching Slade let you get away, with your other filth.\" Tod growled. \"My son is not \"filth\", Chief. He's just a normal kid, who's sense of adventure can get him into trouble. I thought you were cool with him, but it turns out you're still a jerk, huh?\". Chief inched closer to Tod. \"He's a fox, and so are you! You are filth!\" Copper growled. \"Enough! You two are grown adults! Act like it! Despite your differences, you still act like children. Tod, stop provoking Chief. And Chief, show Tod some damn respect! After all, he saved you from becoming bear food last week.\" Both Chief and Tod groaned. Chief got angry. \"Copper, we signal our hunters to kill them! He's lucky he's still not hanging on a wall! You think Tod actually cares about Scoot? Or is he just ehhmm... Covering himself so you don't attack him\". Copper looked at his fox friend, who was tearing up. Copper had to defend him. \"No, Chief. It was MY idea to watch Cap and Scoot. Tod actually didn't want anything to do with us.\" Copper walked to Tod, and put his front leg around his shoulder. This made the fox feel better. Copper continued, \"He's got a family to take care of. He's no longer the dumb kit which nearly got himself killed when he was younger. Tod's damn brave to ask for this favor. So don't you dare belittle him! You have no idea what the poor guy has been through. I myself am lucky that I never lost a child!\" Chief was taken aback. He didn't realize Copper cared about Tod so much. The fox gritted his teeth. \"You have no sympathy\". Tod hissed. \"And I get it: we're natural enemies. But you have NO idea how hard it is to be a fox, chased most of your life by hunters who only want your skin. I made a mistake that got my children killed. How do you think I feel? Or am I truly just \"vermin?!\" Chief reflected back. \"I have no sympathy for you. Especially YOU, personally! You ended my hunting days! Now, I want to end your days!\" Copper knew things would get ugly fast, if he didn't do something. He leapt between Tod and Chief. \"Knock it off!\" He yelled. Tod growled. \"Maybe if you weren't so greedy, like your master, as to chase me on the railroad bridge, you'd still have a perfectly normal leg! It's your fault, Chief! Realize that. Amos did, and it's the reason I'm still alive to this day, right in front of you.\" Chief snarled back. \"Amos should have killed you in the forest, if you were smart, you would have left Copper to die!\" This caused Coppers lips to quiver, but it only made Tod angrier. \"I saved him because he was my friend! I didn't want to see him torn apart. Believe me, Chief: I was expecting to die on that shore. I was expecting a bullet in my puny head. Turns out Copper never really was my enemy after all.\" Chief snarled. \"It still doesn't make any sense! How on Earth do a fox and a hound become 'friends'? Predator and prey, enjoying each other.\" Tod smiled. \"The magic of childhood, Chief. We knew each other as pups. History repeats itself. What would killing me solve? Nothing. So chill out bud, we don't have to be enemies.\" Chiefs demeanor lightened up. Copper decided to step in, to halt the argument. \"Look Chief, just let the two pups play for one more day, then you never have to see them again.\" Chief sighed, and took a deep breath. This isn't going my way. \"I don't have an issue with Cap, or, uh, little Copper.\" He spoke. \"My only beef is with Tod, and Tod alone. I only wanted to start shit, and it backfired.\" Tod became confused. Chief could tell, so he explained. \"I hate you, and that will always be true. But the little rodent hasn't caused any problems for me. He's well behaved, and bright, which even Alex notices. In fact out of him and Scoot, I'd say he's the most mature of the two. I guess you're raising him right.\" Tod smiled. My son's mature? Who ya trying to fool?\" He laughed. \"I guess you can say something nice, after all.\" Chief couldn't help but smile. Copper couldn't believe it. \"Are you two getting along?\" Tod rolled his eyes. \"This is the exception, not the norm. He still wants to chew my skin!\" The three of them didn't notice the other hound who was awoke. She looked at Tod in disgust. \"C - Copper?! Who is this, and why are you and Chief talking to him?\" Copper explained. \"Oh, honey, this is my old friend Tod I told you about. He's also Scoot's little Fox friend's father.\" Tod smirked at Daisy. \"Nice to meet you! You seem a bit surprised.\" Daisy blushed. \"A little bit. So, you saved my husband from a bear, huh? That's pretty brave of you, uh Tod. I never thought I'd converse with a fox.\" \"Yeah,\" Tod replied, \"I just didn't know any better when I was young. Seems like our kids get along pretty well though.\" Daisy giggled. \"Yeah, it seems like they do get along, despite their differences. My daughter's a little jealous that Scoot has a fox friend. She wants one too, but I told her it probably wouldn't be a good idea.\" Tod frowned. \"My daughter's jealous too, but I told her it's not safe out here. She has a special coat that any Hunter would want.\" This got Daisy interested. \"Your daughter? That's too bad I guess. I wonder if they would get along. I'm not much of a hunting dog, so I have nothing against our other canine family members, if you get what I mean.\" Chief interrupted. \"I don't think I could handle two foxes anyway. Soon enough, I'll be seeing orange!\" Tod laughed at this. \"What's so funny?\" Asked Chief. \"My daughter is white, just a bit of orange.\" Tod replied. Copper smiled. \"And she is beautiful, which is why you want to keep her from harm. She literally glows.\" Tod was entertained with this exchange,you but he thought iy getting late. \"You know, we've been here for a while, but we haven't addressed the main issue: we gonna do this final get-together?\" Copper replied, \"yeah, Tod, by the pond. It should be safe on Friday, three days from now.\" \"Gotcha pal. Everyone else, take care of yourselves. Even you, Chief.\" Chief smiled. \"You too, Tod. Don't let anything else tear you apart, that's my job!\" He giggled. Tod smiled back, \"heh, we'll see Chief. We'll see.\" And off he went, back home.[Chapter 21] II Chapter 10: And There You'll Always Be Friday, April 8 The sound of a truck pulling up to his driveway woke Amos up. What the hay is that? He quickly got dressed, and ran out his front door. There, in front of him, stood an old friend. \"It's been awhile, Sam.\" \"Yes it has, Amos. Two years it seems?\" \"Seems about right.\" Answered Amos. \"We used to hunt right in these backwoods together. We would get so much game. You, Me, Chief and Buster. The good old days.\" His friend laughed. \"Yeah, Ol' Buster was a great hound dog, until he went berserk, and I had to give him to the authorities. You saved him though.\" This was Sam Aloth. He used to be hunting buddies with Amos, until Buster bit him. Sam wasn't a bad hunter, but he was very clumsy and slow. He received the name \"Sloth\" from his hunting party. \"Come on in, I'll cook breakfast for ya, and we can talk!\" Amos offered. Sam agreed. At the table, Amos and Sloth talked about how their life was the past couple years. Sam became a business man, and was fairly wealthy. He wanted to get back into hunting though, he had a passion for it. Amos told him about his family, Liam and Alex. He told him about Scoot and how he had an unusual fox friend. This intrigued Sloth.\" Your grandson's hound has a fox friend? Haha, you don't hear that everyday!\" Amos grumbled. \"Alex defends that thing with all his life. So, I've given up attempting to kill it. The father visited yesterday though, and that wasn't a fun event.\" \"Did you kill the father?\" Asked Sloth. \"That might solve anything future problems.\" Amos sighed. \"No, but I had reasons to let it go. I felt some remorse for the fella. Next time I see him though, he'll be on my wall!\" Sam pondered. \"Ya know, the last thing I hunted, before Buster bit me, was a fox. Two actually: a male and a female. The male was an easy kill, but the girl took a lot of effort to kill. Buster killed it before I shot it dead. Really strange.\" \"Maybe we can start again someday. You can help me train Alex and his dog.\" \"I like that idea.\" Sloth replied. \"Wake up kid!\" Scoot opened his eyes, to see his father looking above him. \"What dad?\" \"Follow me.\" Scoot was confused, but was bored anyway, so he followed. \"Uhh, okay.\" Cap tried to keep up with his dad. \"Why are we going this way dad!? Isn't it dangerous?\" Tod stopped and smirked at his son. \"Yes it is! But don't you love getting into trouble? \"Uhh, no.\" Tod couldn't help but laugh. \"Just chill out, we're almost there.\" They came upon a tall curtain of grass. \"Walk through it.\" Tod said. \"Wh-\" \"JUST DO IT!\" \"Ok\", Cap defeatedly said. He walked through the grass. There, sitting down next to the lake was his puppy friend, who saw him and smiled. \"Cap!?\" \"Scoot!?\" The two of them ran towards each other, and tumbled onto the grass. \"I thought I'd never see you again!\" Cap sobbed. \"Me neither!\" Scoot cried. Copper and Tod walked out of the grass. Copper spoke. \"We figured you guys should be able to properly say goodbye. This is the last time you can see each other. I'm sorry.\" \"We're making sure you guys are safe today,\" Tod said. \"When it's time to leave, ya gotta leave though.\" Cap wanted to throw a tantrum right then and there. But he knew it would reflect poorly on him. \"I guess it's a good idea then. Scoot, wanna play hide and seek?\" \"Yeah, Cap! Let's go!\" Copper and Tod watched, as their son's played together, mirroring their own childhood. \"It's hard to watch, Copper. They're just like us!\" Tod stuttered. You and I, we aren't so different We have many things the same But society will divide us Oh, such it is a shame \"Copper, I'm up here!\" Scoot cried out. Cap looked up, and saw his friend hiding in the treetops. He couldn't help but smile. Herein lies a story One you're sure to find Ends too soon abruptly By leaving you behind The two of them jumped in the lake, splishing and splashing each other. Cap's hat was soaked, but he didn't care. Now was the time to worry about his friend. There's nothing we can do. It so happens to be true. It's who we are_ It's who we are_ (Who we are) Maybe it's cause of our differences And our differences remain true Those that which are preventing Me from having fun with you It's obvious that our friendship Was never meant to be My friend I promise you, I will I will ne - ver forget you_ Now, the two friends were chasing each other around the field. This time Cap made sure that he avoided the trees. Cap stopped running and let Scoot collapse into him. They were playfully gnawing and growling, as dogs do. The paths that lead us forward Will Split us far apart But they can never, take away What comes from within the heart The sun was starting to go down. Tod signaled that they had an hour left. They decided to just lay down in the grass, and chat about their futures. Cap still wanted to keep his title as fastest critter in the forest. He hoped someday he would find a mate. Scoot was ready to be a top hunting dog. He still liked Annie. Cap asked what Scoot would do if they ever met again. Scoot reassured Cap, that he would never try to hurt him. He said Alex would know better, and wouldn't shoot Cap. The odd pair of friends would soon be no more. We thought this day would never come How could we be so dumb? I'd give up more than a petty dime If we could have more time It's who we are_ It's who we are_ (Who we are) Maybe it's cause of our differences And our differences remain true Those that which are preventing Me from being here with you It's obvious that our friendship Was never meant to be My friend I promise you, I will I will ne - ver forget you_ The two friends said their goodbyes, they couldn't hold back the tears. Cap was almost ready to leave, when out of the grass, came Alex. Cap looked at Alex, then back to his father. He ran toward Alex, and jumped in his arms. Without saying a word, Alex cuddled Cap. He gave him a hug, and Cap licked him on the cheek. Alex noticed Tod was getting impatient, as he started growling. Alex let Cap go, and started crying, as he loved playing with Cap. Scoot and Cap walked up to each other for the last time. Cap cried. \"My friend I promise, I will never, ever forget you.\" Scoot sobbed. \"Goodbye Copper.\" \"Goodbye Scoot.\" The two pairs of father and son walked away from each other, for the last time. It was the last time they would ever see each other again. ... ... Or was it? That night, a seemingly happy Buster went to wake up Copper. \"Copper, wake up.\" \"Wh- why?\" \"Meet me on the side of the barn.\" What does he want? Thought Copper. As he reluctantly followed. He soon found out. Buster was grinning. \"So, your kids said good bye today, huh? I could've attacked, but I decided to show some mercy.\" \"What do you want?!\" Copper inquired. The dark hound laughed. \"I still want to kill Copper. You know, Tod's son. I will hunt him down, till he is finished!\" Copped was frustrated. \"Why would you tell me this?\" \"Because, Copper my friend: I want to make a deal. If you agree, I won't touch the little rat.\" This can't be good, thought Copper. \"What's the deal?\" Buster walked out of the shadow of the barn, and looked toward the forest. \"I want you to kill Tod.\" ... \"What?!\" \"It's simple,\" chuckled Buster. \"You kill Tod, and I leave his family alone. Wouldn't want that white little girl to die too, would you?\" Copper tackled Buster. \"You aren't gonna touch them!\" Buster laughed. \"Ha, you don't know what I'm going to do, Copper! However, you can save those kids from a painful death. Just kill their father! Hahahaha!\" Buster's voice got softer. \"Or I'll lead Liam right to the poor little foxies home. Wouldn't that be a shame? If they all perished?\" Copper got off of Buster, trying not to look him in the eyes. The dark hound grinned. \"You already know what Liam did to Copper. What if he did that to all of them?\" Copper became fearful, and his face reflected this. \"Why do you want to kill them?\" Buster explained. \"That family is tricky to kill, and when you fail at finishing them off, it makes you want to kill them even more!\" Buster grimaced. \"But that TOD is the problem. If he is still alive, I'll kill his entire family in front of him. If he's dead, there's no need to then, and they can live\". Copper was conflicted. \"I'll stop you!\" Buster gave Copper an evil smile. \"You won't. However, you have a week to decide. Tick, tock.\" Buster left Copper alone. Copper looked toward the forest, where his fox friend lived. I really don't want to do this, but Buster has left me no choice. Your kids are innocent, they don't deserve to die. Your mate never did anything either. But you, we had trouble in the past. I never had anything against you, really. But your kids must live, and I know Buster will stop at nothing till they are finished. You've had a sad life, it couldn't possibly get any more awful. We're the best of friends, you and I, and I don't want to see you die. But even I'll admit I'd rather have one perish than more. I'm doing this for our own good. We can put a stop to this, but there is always a high price to pay, even you know that. Thus, I extend this thought to you, as the last time I think positively of you, as I could never think of killing a friend. This is how it has to be. ... I'm sorry, Tod. End of Part II Who is Sloth? Will Buster get Copper to do his bidding? Will Scoot and Copper (the fox) be friends again?[Chapter 22] Part III: A test of Friendship Chapter 21: Cap's Forest Run Two weeks later… Friday, April 22 The two weeks following their separation was hard to get through for Cap and Scoot. Luckily for the fox, his other Fox friend's came back from their trip, so he wasn't lonely. \"I'm gonna win!\" Exclaimed his gray fox friend, Silver. \"No your not!\" Shouted Cap, desperately trying to match his friends speed. The pain in his paw was nearly gone, but it still affected his ability to run. This was a way to ignore the pain. Seeing the log that marked the finish line, Cap picked up speed. Unfortunately, he tripped on a bump in the forest floor. His friend noticed, and ran back to help him up. \"Ugh, still not there, but I will be.\" Cap groaned. His friend laughed. \"You'll eventually get back to normal! For now, let's go find the others!\" They scouted out where the other three of their group went. They found them near the trail that runs throughout the middle of the woods. Cap's sister was there too! Lily was there, along with their other friends: Comet, Skip, and Bandit. They were all red foxes, unlike Silver. \"Hey!\" Cap shouted, startling the group. Lily spoke up, \"Your leg healed yet?!\" Cap raised his paw. \"I think a couple more days and it'll be good. Till then, Silver is the fastest creature in the forest!\" \" What do you guys wanna do?\" Asked Bandit. \"I wanna see how my Ol' friend Scoot is doing, from the treetops. Then I'll be down to play hide and seek!\" Lily was worried, \"you know Copper, dad said you couldn't see him ever again.\" Cap groaned. \"It's how I cope with it, okay?\" Without warning he scaled the closest tree,and ran towards his ex-friends house. Silver followed him. They stopped on the closest tree to the farm. It was still quite far away. From here, it looked like Scoot was lonely again. His friends went home last week, but now he knew more about hunting. Scoot looked up from his spot, as he could see an orange animal in the trees. He attempted a wave, and Cap waved back. Surprisingly, Buster was no where to be seen. \"So, you taught that mutt how to climb, eh?\" Asked Silver. Copper responded, \"Yeah, but I'm not worried about it. He taught me some evasive hunting techniques.\" \"Ahh, I see. Let's hope the other dogs don't notice us. As a matter of fact, we should probably get back.\" The two foxes decided to head back to their little group. The other kits were sitting on a log, waiting for the other two to come back. They didn't realize, that they had an unexpected visitor. It snuck up on them, before pouncing on Bandit. \"Hey! What's the big idea!?\" He shouted. The dark hound wasted no time replying. \"I've never seen so many of you rodents all at once! Let's see, one, two... Four? Heheh, you guys would look great on my owners door.\" Bandit squirmed under the grip of Buster, but he didn't have enough strength. Buster ignored the squirming prey, and scanned the other foxes. He came across Lily, and an evil smile slowly spread across his face. \"Where's your brother?\" Lily didn't respond. Buster tightened his grip on Bandit. \"I'm going to kill him, unless you tell me where he is. So, WHERE IS COPPER?\" Lily still didn't respond, she was too scared. Busters smile grew wider, as he choked the life out of the young fox. \"You are Tod's daughter, Lily. If you don't answer, I'll kill you too! After all, my hunter would love your coat!\" Lily tried her best to distance herself from the hound. \"But, we don't- associa- with hounds- anymore.\" Buster looked forward to what was coming next. \"Not the answer I wanted!\" He almost got to the point of crushing Bandit's neck, when a voice stopped him. \" Looking for me, jerk?\" Buster gazed above him. There was Cap, ready to jump on Buster from a tree. \"Well, well, well,\" said the hound, \"looks like little Cap is almost as good as new! I like when my prey has a fighting chance.\" Cap jumped down from his tree, and landed in front of Buster. \"You leave my friends alone!\" He hissed. \"Bwahaha! This is cute. As if you think I'm not going to kill all of you! In fact, after today, you and your sister won't have any protection against me!\" The hound laughed. \"I'll finish you off first, Cap!\" Buster growled, which caused Cap to break into a run. The hound pursued him. Tod walked ever so closer to The Slade farm. Copper came by last night, and told him to meet him. \"Copper? Buddy?\" The bloodhound appeared from his doghouse, smiling at his friend. \"Hey, Tod! I gotta show you something today.\" Tod was confused. \"Uhh, show me what?\" \"Just follow me.\" Copper replied, as he started walking East. \"Okay... I guess.\" Said Tod. Copper walked toward his objective, with conflicting thoughts in his head. I don't know why I am doing this. I don't want to do this. I'm doing it though. Poor Tod. He doesn't know I'm leading him to his grave. Cap kept running, still being pursued by Buster. The hound couldn't keep up with him, no matter how hard he tried. What Cap didn't realize, was that it was all a trick: a distraction. He was trying to keep Cap away from his father, so that Copper could kill him. Buster didn't actually know where Copper was going to perform the deed, but he just kept chasing Cap. Lily was actually chasing them, but was far enough that Buster couldn't detect her. Something else interested Lily though: a young black hound puppy. Scoot didn't understand where his dad was going, but he decided to look around for clues. He heard barking coming from the area near the railroad bridge, so he decided to go check it out. Alex was home for the day, but he was nowhere to be found. Shadow, on the other hand, decided to brave the forest. She heard a hound chasing an animal, but didn't think much of it. She found something else, though, that made her ecstatically happy. Lily stared at the black puppy in front of her. \"Uhh... Hello! What- you- name?\" She trembled. The puppy smiled. \"I'm Shadow! You're a fox, right?\" Lily nervously grabbed her tail. \"I- believe- so...\" Shadow noticed the fox was nervous about their encounter. \"Hey, it's okay! I'm not gonna hurt you! What are you doing out here by yourself?\" The fox trembled. \"I-, was- chasi- brother and I\". Lily sighed. \"I'm sorry. I'm scared.\" Shadow sighed. \"I wanted to know where my brother went too. He used to play with his fox friend, but now he randomly runs around the field.\" This perked Lily's interest. \"Your brother had a fox friend? Wait a minute... your my brother's, friends sister!\" Shadow beamed. \"Ahhh, so your the little white fox that dad was talking about. It's a shame what happened to our brothers though. Say, you wanna see if we can find em'?\" Lily wanted to track her brother down to make sure he was safe. \"Sounds like a good idea!\" She smiled. Now I have a hound friend too, Copper! Cap's chase came to a hill, near the river. There was no where to run, now! One side of the hill lead to a steep incline covered in Sharp branches, while the other lead to a ledge next to the water. The fox sighed in defeat, nearly out of breath. \"So, this is where it ends, huh?\" The hound smirked. \"This is nothing but a wild goose chase, Cap. You're separated from your father: your protector. Soon enough, he will be no more!\" \"What are you talking about?\" Asked an alarmed Cap. \"I have a friend that will finish the job!\"[Chapter 23] III Chapter 22: Still the Best of Friends? Shadow was enjoying the company of her new 'friend'. \"So, what do you guys do for fun?\" Shadow asked. \"I played tag with Scoot and Cap a couple times.\" \"We usually race around the forest, or swim. Our dad told us that by doing so, we avoid becoming a hunters next pelt.\" Answered the young vixen. They were already near the river. Shadow noticed someone on the nearby hill. \"I see Cap!\" She yelled, as she ran up the hill. Lily just stayed put, as she noticed the scary black hound from earlier, was accompanying her brother. Unfortunately for Shadow, she lost her footing on one of the rocks jutting out of the hill. She hit the ground hard, and blacked out Scoot came to the river clearing. He saw that his father was at the top of the quarry, with Tod. What could they be doing up there. ... Tod was confused. \"What are we doing up here?\" \"Just run to the end of the bridge.\" Said Copper. The two of them started to run across the bridge, when Tod felt something heavy pin him down. It was Copper! Tod was cross. \"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" With tears in his eyes, Copper replied, \"I'm sorry, Tod. You're family will be safe, I promise.\" Tod, struggling with all his might, could not fully comprehend the betrayal. He gave Copper a look of fright. \"You- you are actually killing me, aren't you?\" He whined. The hound dared not to answer. \"You're holding me until a train comes, huh? What problem are you trying to solve? I thought we were friends?\" Copper sighed. \"I'm only doing this because I am your friend, Tod. I care about your kids though.\" Tod was still confused. \"So killing me will protect them? Are you out of your mind?!\" ... Scoot saw, in horror, his father's plan for murder. He howled as loudly as he could, which got the attention of his owner. Alex rushed toward his puppies cry, only to be stopped by Amos and Liam. \"What are you runnin' too Sunny? Got a date?\" Teased Amos. Alex grabbed his Grandpa's hand. \"I heard Scoot howling by the bridge! Something must be wrong!\" Liam ran toward their home. \"I'll meet you there! Go get that rascal!\" Amos and Alex ran toward the bridge. \"You reckon Copper's there too?\" Asked Amos. \"Probably,\" answered Alex. Tod could feel the rumble in the tracks. I have less then two minutes to think of something. Maybe if Copper is distracted, I can push him off of me. \" Hey, Copper! How you gonna get off the bridge in time.\" Copper's mind was racing. Shit, how did I not think of that!? This seemed to loosen his hold on Tod. Tod was ready to use all of his strength. The rumbling in the tracks increased, and the lights of the train could be seen across the bridge. I'm going to kick us both off this bridge. Down below, the Slade's arrived to see what was happening on the bridge. \"Copper's with that fox!\" Shouted Amos. \"They are going to get hit by a train!\" Yelled Alex. Tod was deep in his thoughts. He felt the train approach closer. It was about 15 seconds away now. Alright, stay calm. 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. He closed his eyes, focusing entirely on his legs. 4. 3. 2. 1. The train was nearly upon them. Copper regretted his idea. Tod was ready. Here we go! He kicked as hard as he could, sending Copper hurling into the water below. Tod dove in after him , but was so exhausted, he became unconscious during the fall. ... Back on the hill, a very angry Buster watched, as his plan failed. \"What are you looking at?\" A child's voice growled. Busted gritted his teeth. \"Your last chance of survival, which has gone.\" Cap was on the opposite side of the hill. Buster charged toward him. The hound laughed. \"If I don't kill you, I can still take her out!\" Cap looked behind him in horror. There lie an unconscious Shadow, right behind him. oh no, Shadow! She's behind me, and Buster's going to charge right into her! Cap thought. He looked past Shadow, to where the hill ended at a sharp drop, above a flat Rock, twenty or so feet below. That fall will kill her! Cap circled around shadow, quickly deciding how to save her from the charging hound. I'm sorry! He rammed her off the hill, into the bundle of sharp thorns. Buster ran straight into Cap, but he flew into the water below, as his angle of descent was changed. Alex didn't see Cap charge into Shadow, but he did see her nearly get impaled by the branches. He ran as fast as he could, grabbing Shadow from the pile of death. She was bleeding heavily. The only one who saw Cap shove Shadow was Scoot. He was pissed. Why would you do that Copper? Why would you attempt to kill my sister? A dark thought crossed his mind. Maybe I was wrong about you, Cap. Maybe there is a reason we are supposed to be enemies. You tried to kill my sister, and you failed. He snarled at the young fox in the water, swimming to shore. Well, I won't fail. ... Copper dove underwater, in search of Tod. What have I done? How could I even attempt to end his life? He found the red fox, at the bottom of the river. He grabbed onto it's neck, and dragged it toward the surface. When they emerged, Tod was conscious again. Copper glanced toward his friend, who had tears in his eyes, along with a face of dismay. They got to the shore of the river. \"Why?\" The fox finally spoke. Copper looked down at the ground. \"I couldn't kill you Tod.\" He Sighed, while staring off into the distance. \"What was I thinking?\" ... Cap reached the side of the river, and pulled himself up. He met the angry face of his puppy friend, who was growling at him. Suddenly, Scoot lunged on top of him. \"You wanna play?\" Questioned Cap. The hound gave no response. Instead, he latched onto Cap's bad leg with his teeth, and bit down. \"Owww! Scoot! That hurts! Let go!\" When he figured out his friend wouldn't let go, he yelled out in pain. Alex ran toward the injured fox, first giving Shadow to Amos. Scoot's face was full of hatred. He let go of Cap's bleeding paw, and attempted to lunge at his face, when Alex picked up Cap. \"What's the matter with you guys?\" The boy asked. \"You never tried to kill each other before!\" The two father's ran up to the side of Alex. Tod did not want to converse with Copper, but they both were alarmed to see Scoot hurting Cap. \"Son, why are you hurting Cap?\" Asked Copper. Scoot growled. \"Because he hurt my sister!\" Cap wanted to explain, but the pain in his leg was too much to handle. All he could do was whimper. For some strange reason, Alex carried some cloth in his pocket, which he wrapped around Cap's leg. Alex saw his father running to him, with a shotgun. \"You guys better go!\" He yelled to Tod. He dropped Cap (which caused him to yelp) and picked up Scoot. The foxes tried to run away, but Cap was stopped by his friend's anger. \"Cap!\" Scoot screamed. The fox stopped, and turned around, to face Scoot. The puppy was enraged. \"Cap, I'm warning you. I've been on a real hunt now. I've killed pests. I'm a real hunting dog now, despite my age. Don't think my owner will protect you forever! He's mine! And when he realizes I have no interest in you anymore, he will drop you dead! You hurt my sister, and I'm going to get you back for it! If its the last thing I do, I'll kill you!\" Cap wanted to reply, but Alex ran off with Scoot, as he didn't enjoy his puppy growling. Cap limped back home, in tears. Scoot doesn't understand, I tried to save her! History repeats itself...[Chapter 24] III Chapter 23: Captured Saturday, April 23rd \"I don't understand it!\" Shouted Cap to his group of friends. \"You'd think Scoot would know I wouldn't dare try to hurt his sister!\" Lily was upset, as she wanted to play with Shadow, but she couldn't, due to the puppy's injuries. She understood why Cap injured her though. \"I know it's sad brother, but maybe it's a good thing we won't come across them again. They are hunters after all, they kill us!\" \"Yeah!\" Said Bandit, \"that black hound almost killed me yesterday! How could you trust them?\" \"And didn't that one hound try to kill your father?\" Questioned Skip. \"I'd say good riddance.\" Cap glared daggers at his sister. \"You're right. They are hunters meant to kill us. The difference now is, that Scoot wants to kill me!\" \"Hey! We'll protect you Copper!\" Assured Comet. \"He won't get near you.\" \"That's nice.\" Agreed Cap. \"But I don't want you guys getting involved. I need to face this. Alone. I have to tell him why I did what I did!\" Cap started walking toward the farm. \"Copper, don't go!\" Yelled Lily. \"Let me be!\" The bright orange fox yelled back. He paid no attention to the calls to come back. He had a mission. Even if it had the possibility of killing him. I don't want to live in a world where we are enemies, Scoot. Even if you killed me, I'd still be granted that wish. Copper was surveying the forest from his doghouse. His son was on the other side of the yard, talking to Buster. Being friendly to Buster. Copper knew that his son wasn't playing when he said he wanted Cap dead. Copper wanted to make sure that didn't happen. He saw orange in the forest. He sighed. \"Cap, please. Don't come back here! You aren't safe here! Go home, you're going to get us both in trouble!\" The fox was silent, his head faced the ground. Eventually, he mustered the courage to talk. \"Copper, I need to talk to Scoot. He needs to know what happened! Busted was trying to ram me off the hill, but Shadow was behind me, and the fall would of killed her, and I tried to do something, and I-\" \"Shhhhhhhh\". Copper interrupted. \"I know what happened, Cap. But Scoot is in a bad state of mind right now. He won't listen to anyone. You did hurt my daughter, regardless of what happened. I am mad at you for that.\" Cap's lips quivered. \"But- there- was- nothing.\" \"I know Cap, that in situations where one must think fast, mistakes will be made. You pushed her into the sharp branches. Could you have not pushed her off the mountain but nudged her to the side instead? Maybe. But at that moment, you tried to do what you thought was right.\" The hound sighed. \"Look, I'm only mad at you for causing Shadow to get injured. I'm not mad at you for anything else, despite it not being completely your fault. It's my protective instincts as a father, I'm sure Tod has them too.\" Cap remembered his father's struggle yesterday. \"Why did you try to kill my dad?\" Copper took a deep breath. \"I'd rather not answer that question. I was told by doing it, it would protect you from any more harm. Sadly, it seems I was lied to.\" The two of them stared at each other for a moment. \"Why does Scoot think I tried to kill Shadow,\" Cap cracked. \"Because, Cap. As hounds, it is built into us to hate you foxes. We've been long bred to kill your kind. He saw you push Shadow, and instead of trying to find reason, that instinct took over. It's the same reason I vowed revenge on your dad.\" Copper looked behind him, and saw that his son and Buster was coming towards him. He turned back to Cap. \"You better go, before something happens.\" Cap agreed, and ran back into the woods, and Copper ran towards Amos' house. He didn't want to converse with Buster. Cap decided to hide in the trees, and listen to what Scoot and Buster would say. He planned to apologize after Buster left. \"So you think Cap will come back and we can take him out?' \"Precisely, Scoot! That dumb fox still thinks you guys are friends!\" \"That rodent will pay! But Buster, I'm the one that gets to finish him, okay? \"That's fine, kid! I told you that you would be killing that so called friend of yours, haha! Just stick to the plan!\" Buster whispered something into Scoot's ear, but Cap couldn't hear it. \" Im going to go hide. He's up in the tree.\" Jake could not take it anymore. From his dad yelling about flashbacks, to the sound of his neighbor's dogs barking and making noise, he had to do something. He opened his drawer and found a small pocket knife. I'm going to stab myself, in the shape of a dog bite. I am going to pretend to pet that puppy. When it gets closer, I'm going to scream, pretend I got bit, and roll up my sleeve. Animal Control will come, and they will take that damn dog away! It's fool proof! Alex ruined my life at school, so I'm going to run his life! \"Dad, call Animal Control soon! I'm going to fix our problem!\" Scoot tried to find Cap in the trees. He didn't need to though, as the red-hatted fox walked out of the grass. The two locked eyes. Nothing was said for a moment. \"Hey Cap\". \"Hey Scoot. H- h- how's Shadow?\" \"She's got bruises on her face and back. You really did a number on her.\" Cap pondered. This is going okay so far. Maybe he won't call Buster? \" Look, Scoot. I- I didn't mean it! I can explain!\" \"Of course, you didn't mean it!\" Of course you didn't, you vermin! \"You don't have to explain anything, Cap! I understand!\" Cap was confused. \"You do?\" \"Yeah Cap. I understand. But you don't understand... that you're as good as dead!\" the last thing Cap remembered was something heavy hitting him. He blacked out. Cap awoke to the sound of howling. He was pinned down, by Scoot. \"You're stupid, Cap. You actually thought I was going to be nice to you, after what you did!\" \"You wouldn't let me explain!\" \"There's nothing to explain, Cap! I saw everything! And now, while I would love to wait till we're older, so I can kill you like the pest you are, in the forest; I'd rather you embrace a death you deserve!\" Cap could faintly see Buster and Liam in the distance. The hound continued. \"When I think you've had enough, I'll let Liam shoot you!\" Cap's mind was racing. I have to get out of this hold! If Liam and Buster get here, they are going to skewer me! I'm good as dead then! Cap rolled over, causing Scoot to collapse on the ground. The fox got on his legs, and ran as fast as he could, away from the hounds. \"Get him!\" Shouted Liam. Cap tried his best to ignore the pain in his leg. He didn't have the stamina to outrun them for long, so he had to think of something. The hounds and the owner we're right behind him. He ducked under the fence, and ran under it. He was past the farm now, on the street of the cul-de-sac. Cap hid in one of the neighbors rosebushes on the other side. The dogs lost him, but he could see them from across the street. Liam huffed, and in defeat, went inside, and slammed the door. Cap noticed a boy, about Alex's age, was walking over to Scoot. he noticed, that the boy's arm was bleeding, but then he covered it up. Cap had a bad feeling about this. Jake walked on to Liam's yard. Scoot was in the front, searching for Cap. \"Here puppy!\" The boy called out while walking closer, ominously giggling. Scoot heard, and turned around. He ran to Jake. Cap realized now why Jake's arm was red. He still had a little faith in his friend. Scoot proceeded to get closer to Jake. Cap had to do something. He ran out of his hiding spot. \"Scoot, don't go near him!\" Scoot noticed the fox, but ignored his warning. Now, Scoot was close enough to touch Jake. It was too late. Jake slapped Scoot across his muzzle, which caused him to growl. The boy then uncovered his wounds. \"Aaahhhhhhhhhh!\" Jake screamed \"He bit me!\" Alex ran out of his house, hearing Jake screamed. \"What the hel-\" Cap bolted towards Jake, and grabbed his pants with his teeth. He wanted to distance him from Scoot. Jake kicked Cap in the stomach, with his other foot. \"This stupid fox bit me too!\" An old man came toward Alex, from Jake's house. Amos heard the commotion, and ran towards it. \"I called animal control son, they will be here any minute now.\" Jake's father said. He then turned to Alex. \"And you! You are despicable! You shouldn't own a dog, if you can't train them to not attack people! Well I guess you get what you deserve then!\" \"B- but Scoot would never-\" Alex was interrupted. \" bet skewt wed never CAN IT!\" The man mocked. \"Well he did, and now he's going to die because of you! You very irresponsible owner!\" Scoot was in the middle of the arguing adults. He tried to run away, but he found himself hoisted into the air, and thrown into a cage. He bolted for the door, but it was locked! \"Any more?\" Asked the animal control officer. Cap ran straight into the door of the cage. \"I know you're innocent Scoot! I kn-\" he found himself thrown into a separate cage. \"That fox bit me in the leg!\" Screamed Jake. The officer acknowledged him. Copper and Chief ran to the front yard, and noticed the two pups trapped. \"What happened?!\" Chief growled at Cap. \"Was this you're doing?\" Cap talked through the tears. \"No! That boy cut himself and pinned it on Scoot saying that he bit him! He even smacked him across the face! I bit down on his pants to drag him away, and I got caught!\" Copper gazed at Scoot. \"Is this true?\" Scoot looked up at his father, and slowly nodded. Copper growled. He knew what happened to dogs who bit people. However, his son was innocent, and he was going to die over a lie! \"Scoot... they are going to kill you... And Cap. I'm sorry son. I will get that jerk back for this, I promise!\" Scoot and Cap we're alarmed. \"What?!\" They both shouted in unison. Copper tilted his head toward the ground. He stumbled, \"a- any animal that bites a human is grounds for being put down. It's not painful though, I... promise.\" That was the last thing he said to the two of them, as the officer grabbed the cages and flung them into his truck. \"Wh- where are you taking them?\" Alex cried. The officer looked back at Alex. \"A facility in the city. Don't worry, they got a few hours left.\" The officer coldly went to the front of his truck, and started his car. Alex watched, as the truck drove away, carrying his animal \"friends\". Scoot was staring at the fox that was in the cage next to him. Cap glanced at Scoot. \"If I was out of this cage, I'd kill you right now!\" The hound remarked. Cap turned over and went to sleep. There was no point in arguing, as everything would end soon.[Chapter 25] III Chapter 24: The Truth A/N: This chapter utilizes extreme amounts of profanity! You have been warned. Alex was forced to attend to his \"enemy\". Amos told him to patch up Jake, while he conversed with Dale, Jake's father, inside. The two boys were sitting at a picnic table in the backyard. Alex recollected what the officer said to him. I know the facility, I volunteered there sophomore year. It's the same pound that Buster was at, but it's connected to a shelter and veterinary clinic. Since it's basically the only 'pound\" in the city, the place is massive. It's in Pittsburgh though- \"Hey dickwad! You gonna bandage me up, or keep staring at me like that?\" Right, I forgot I had to attend to this douchebag. Lovely. Alex got out the gauze and started wiping the blood off Jake's arm with some wipes. \"So, Scoot did this to you, huh? What did you do to him?\" \" I didn't do nothin, jerk! Your piece of shit dog just came up to me and bit me!\" Alex continued wiping the blood off. Jake was still bleeding pretty heavily. Tod was standing near the entrance to the forest. Copper ran to him. He told Tod about what happened, and the lie. Tod stared at the ground in defeat. But anger was overcoming him. \"I know, Tod. It's hard... But there is nothing we can do!\" Tod growled. \"There is something we can do! We are going to show Scoot's owner that the punk is a lying prick! Come on!\" Tod walked toward the two boys. Copper stood still. \"You seem pretty upset.\" The fox laughed. \"Ha! Upset?! I'm pissed!\" Alex finished up bandaging Jake. \"There you are! Good as new!\" The other boy scoffed, and got on his feet. Until he saw Tod. \"Sh- sh- shoot that fox!\" Alex giggled. \"Oh, that's Tod. I don't think he's able to comprehend that you are the reason his son's getting killed!\" \"What?!\" Copper glanced at Tod. \"Maybe we should pull his pants leg up? Cap said he didn't bite him.\" Jake backed away from the fox who was walking toward him. He tried to turn and run, but all of a sudden, the fox was pulling on the bottom of his jeans. \"Get off me, you stupid fox!\" He kicked Tod off of him. Alex noticed something. Jake's leg had no marks! \"Wait, didn't you say that Cap bit you on the leg?\" Jake was furious. \"What the hell are you talking about Slade!?\" The lightbulb went off in Alex's head. Heheheh. You are human garbage, Jake! What else did you lie about? He grabbed Jake's arm and pulled off the cloth, the bleeding stopped. Jake screamed, which caused Amos, Dale, and Liam to come outside. Amos saw something, that made him walk back inside to grab a shotgun. What Alex saw not only made him disappointed in humanity, but made him really want to assault Jake. \"These aren't bite marks! These are knife wounds!\" He threw Jake on the ground. Dale was frozen. Alex continued. \"My dog never bit you! Cap never bit you! It was all a lie!\" Jake was now shaking in fear. \"Why?\" Alex inquired. \"Why would you want my dog to be put down?\" Now Jake's fear went straight into anger. \"Because, your dumbass dog would not shut the hell up! You know how bad it is, having your veteran father yelling at you, because the damn dog reminds him of war? Not to mention, that dog was shit to begin with! Because he had a shitty owner... YOU!\" Alex fought back the tears. No, it wasn't sadness he was feeling. It was rage! He picked Jake up by the collar of his shirt and forced him to his feet. He was really going to make him pay. \"Fuck you!\" Alex screamed, as he punched Jake square in the face, knocking him out cold. Dale was fuming. \"I will have you arrested for assault! I'm not going to let you get-\" Alex grabbed Dale's arm, and twisted it behind his back. The man was sweating bullets. Alex whispered in his ear. \" You killed my fucking dog. You call the cops, I'll make sure you have more to worry about than dogs barking.\" He shoved Dale against the house. \"For a Vietnam Vet, you sure act like a pussy.\" Liam was surprised. But deep down, he was impressed. His son was fighting back for something he believed in. All eyes turned to the door, when Amos appeared, with his shotgun cocked. \"What did I tell you about coming back here, rodent?\" Alex turned to where his gun was pointing. It was the fox. No, without Tod, I wouldn't have found out the truth. The fox froze in fear. Amos put his finger on the trigger, when he felt his shotgun lower. \"What are you doing, Alex?\" \"I'm not letting you kill Tod!\" The teen declared. \"He latched onto Jake's clothes where I could see there were no bites.\" Amos stared at Alex in disbelief. \"You're defending the damn thing again?\" Alex sighed. \"The poor thing doesn't know that they took his son too. Let him be.\" Dale picked Jake up, and carried him home. Liam went inside. Amos gave up on trying to kill Tod, and went home. Buster appeared out of the blue, and ran towards Tod, who was walking back to the forest. The fox didn't notice the hound. The boy wasn't having it. Alex grabbed Buster by the snout and held his mouth shut. \"If I ever see you hurting one of those foxes, I'm really going to punish you, you stupid mutt!\" Alex released Buster, which caused him to run back home. Alex walked toward Tod, who was watching. He sat down next to the fox. Copper collapsed into Alex's lap. The three of them sat there, for what seemed like an eternity. \"You know what I'm gonna do, guys?\" Alex stated. \"I'm gonna get those pups back. Some way, somehow.\" He caressed Copper's forehead. Tod seems to want a piece of the pie, so he nudged Alex. Alex understood, and rubbed Tod under the chin. \"It'll be okay Tod, I promise.\" The fox decided to lay down against Alex's other side, and closed his eyes. Liam walked out of his backdoor, and saw his son sleeping against a tree, with the two animals sawing logs in his lap. He hated the fox, but decided that Alex had a rough day, so he let them be. Alex awoke a couple minutes later, his mind was racing. The pound has a security code that changes with the date. I thought it was a pretty simple math formula, I just gotta remember it.[Chapter 26] III Chapter 25: Locked Away When they arrived at the pound, Scoot and Cap were each thrown into cages in the wall. They were next to each other, but a wall separated them. \"Looks like we have guestsssssss\" Hissed a pitbull. The large room was basically a warehouse, with the cries of animals echoing throughout. Cap couldn't even attempt to sleep. He noticed there was a red marker on his \"cell\". He decided to ask the pitbull if she knew what it was. \"Hey, you! That just hissed at us. What does the red tag mean. The Pitbull chuckled, as did the surrounding dogs. A Rottweiler answered, in what sounded like the voice of a parrot. \"It means you're dead! Har!\" The pitbull decided to clarify, but her normal voice was deeper. \"You're priority to be exterminated. That's what it means. You usually get up to a day. Judging that it's not late, you'll probably be euthanized tonight!\" The dogs started laughing again. Scoot was trying to shield his ears. \"It's no use! Hahahahahaha!\" Chuckled a Chihuahua in front of him. Cap decided to peek outside his cell. He could see a golden retriever next to him! In fact, he saw many puppies next to him! But through the cracks on the other side, he saw his once best friend, curled in a ball, shivering in fright. Cap completely lost it. He started bawling. \"In the span of two weeks, I lost my friend, I lost my family, I lost my home, and my best friend wants to kill me!\" The dogs were now paying attention to Cap's ramblings. \"And now...,\" The young fox whimpered, \"we're both going to die...\" The golden retriever tried to comfort him. \"It's okay little fox! Just think, you won't have to be in sorrow for much longer. Who's your friend?\" Cap whimpered. \"The white brown-spotted bloodhound next to me.\" Scoot was annoyed. \"We aren't friends! You should have never come back! If you didn't, we wouldn't be stuck here!\" \"Just calm down guys!\" One of the dogs said, \"just let bygones be bygones. There's not much you can do now!\" A beagle piped up. \"A fox and a hound are-\" \"Were\" Scoot interrupted. \"Ah yes,\" the beagle continued, \"were friends. That's not a usual thing you hear, but it's interesting regardless.\" \"I just want to find a way to get him back!\" Cap cried. \"I don't want to die knowing we hate each other!\" Scoot growled, \"that ship has sail-\" \"You never let me finish!\" Cap interrupted. \"If you did, you would know the truth! I tried to save Shadow! Buster was going to ram into her!\" Scoot snarled. \"You pushed her into a pit of thorns! How is that saving her?\" Cap sighed. \"Because the alternative was to have her get pushed off, hitting her head on the ground below.\" One of the large doors opened to the room. Out walked a man, presumably one that worked there. They unlatched the cage of the golden retriever puppy. \"Where are they taking you?!\" Worried Cap. The puppy giggled. \"I'm getting adopted silly! I've been waiting weeks, and finally it happened!\" The man picked the puppy up, and smiled. \"There's a nice little girl who's going to be your owner! You gotta get your shots first though, I'm afraid.\" He turned to the two pups, marked for euthanization. \"Poor guys\". He chided, before walking back through the door, golden retriever in his arms. Cap curled up in a ball. I should probably just sleep instead of worrying. He flung his hat into the cage. Maybe someone will find it one day...[Chapter 27] III Chapter 26: The Unlikely Rescue Team A year passed. Cap and Scoot were fully grown now. The Slade's seemed to have warmed up to the Fox's presence. Even Buster didn't seem to mind. Scoot was Alex's pet, but that didn't stop him from running around the forest, daily, with his orange friend. Kat and Alex watched the two scurry off into the woods. Annie gave Chase to the duo. Life was so peaceful now... Alex was startled awake. Reality struck. He noticed the two animals were still sleeping against him. He checked his watch. It was now nine o'clock at night. Time to get moving! He stood up, startling the two canines. \"Sorry, guys.\" He took his truck keys out, and dashed to his vehicle. To his surprise, the two followed him. He got an idea. He took one of the blankets from his porch, and laid it in the backseat of his truck. He patted on the seat, and Copper leapt into the car. Alex put his seat back upright, but was stopped when he saw Tod on the ground, with pleading eyes. He sighed. \"You wanna come too, Tod? Fine. Just don't make a mess of my car!\" Alex put his seat back down, but Tod was confused by the notion. \"Uh, Copper? What does he want?\" \"Just climb in, Tod. But don't make a mess of things.\" Tod jumped up, into the truck, and sat down right next to Copper. The boy fixed the seat, slammed his door, and started the truck. \"Alright,\" said Alex, \"let's get those kids back!\" On the road, Alex decided to roll the windows down for the fox and the hound. Tod stuck his head out the window, and stared into the darkness. There wasn't much to see on the interstate. Alex figured, that it would take about fifty minutes at his current speed. I'm driving with a freaking fox in my truck! Thought Alex. I'm crazy. It's kind of weird how Tod is so tame though. Tod was quiet most of the trip. Copper was noticably more nervous. \"Hey, Tod?\" \"Yeah, pal?' \"Do you think we'll be able to save our kids?\" The fox turned to his friend. \"Absolutely.\" He turned back to the window. The cold nightly air felt good against his face. He couldn't stand the silence anymore. \"Hey, Copper?\" \"Yeah, Tod?\" \"I'm sorry about your daughter. I hope she's doing okay.\" The hound smiled. \"It's not your fault, Tod. Look, I know Cap didn't mean it, but she got hurt, and I'm very protective of my kids. She'll heal though. Are you worried about my son hurting yours?\" The fox sighed. \"Nah, they'll make it up. We were the same way.\" \"I hope you're right Tod,\" said Copper, \"but I don't want Scoot to hurt your Copper. I like the kid.\" Tod didn't respond. He had too many things in his mind. Copper still had one burning question to ask him though. \"Tod, do you still consider us friends?\" Tod chuckled. Now he's the one that still wants to be friends ehh... \"It's complicated Copper. We don't hate each other, that is true. But, I don't believe we can be considered as 'friends', due to our troubled past. We had fun together as kids, but we didn't know how the world worked. We didn't know that you were supposed to hunt me down. I hurt Chief,.which really hurt you. You invaded my home, to enact revenge.\" The fox sighed. \"It's not that I don't trust you, Copper. I just don't consider us as 'friends\" anymore. I'm sorry to say, bud.\" Copper was shocked. Now, Tod was the more careful one, the polar opposite of when they were younger. Still, the hound understood where the fox was coming from. \"You know what, Tod?\" \"What, Copper?\" \"I still consider us as friends.\" The fox giggled. \"Sure ya do. Sure ya do... Ya know, it might have been better if we didn't meet again. Now, in a way, the past is repeating itself. Copper, you're my hero. Every day, I give thanks to the fact that you saved my life. That's why I named my son Copper. I felt like I owed it to you, and you would 'protect' him. It was a knee jerk reaction to losing my kids last year. I felt like the name would protect him, in a way. And now, all this crap happens.\" Tod frowned. Copper put his paw on Tod's shoulder. \"It'll be alright pal.\" \"Just don't try to kill me again!\" Alex arrived to the parking lot of the clinic. The \"warehouse\" which housed the pound was on the other side. Surprisingly, the exterior didn't seem to have any security cameras. He got out of his car, and let the two animals out. \"Don't you guys run away, please!\" He walked around the perimeter of the building, careful to avoid the security cameras. The two canines carefully followed him. When he got to the back door, he took out a pen and scratchpad from his pocket. Time to crack this code... Amos heard his doorbell ring He groggingly walked across his kitchen, and opened the door. On the other side was his son, with a worried look. \"Why the long face?\" Asked Amos. Liam stuttered. \"Alex and Copper are missing.\" \"What!?\" \"I think he took him somewhere, as his truck is not in the driveway.\" Liam sat down, while Amos paced back and forth. \"When did you last see him?\" Amos questioned. \"About two hours ago. He fell asleep against a tree with that fox and Copper in his lap.\" \"Did you get the fox?!\" \"N- no I didn't want to disturb Alex. \"Liam stuttered. \"I decided to let them be.\" Amos twirled the keys to his car in his hand. \"How much you wanna bet he took that fox with him?\" \"That's likely. I'm gonna go grab Buster.\" \"Good idea,\" said Amos. That kid and those blasted foxes! He's supposed to be a hunter! A few minutes later, Amos, Liam and Buster were on the road, heading to the pound. What Amos didn't notice, was that Liam brought his revolver. He concealed it in his pocket. This is for that little fox 'friend' of Scoot's. No more roadblocks for our hunting dog![Chapter 28] III Chapter 27: Girl's Night Out Shadow awoke again, for the third time this night. She groaned from the pain. Every movement sent it throughout her body. Her mother slept next to her for comfort. The puppy's father and brother were missing, which kept her from easily falling asleep. The fact that her owners had gone too, didn't make her feel any better. She was almost fast asleep, when a familiar voice startled her awake. \"Hey!\" The puppy jumped up from her spot, searching around for what made the noise. Once her eyes adjusted, she saw who it was: the little white fox from yesterday. \"Shadow, I need to ask you something!-\" \"Lily! Stay back! I didn't want to do this, as I am putting you in danger!\" An older female voice said. A red fox appeared behind the younger one. Shadow didn't want her fox friend to feel in danger. \"Uhh, ma'am... I'm not going to hurt her! She's perfectly safe with me!\" The mother fox glared daggers at Shadow. 'Uh, mom, it's Cap's friend's sister, she won't hurt us.\" Lily assured. The mother dog was now awoke too. She got up and confronted Vixey. \"Uhh, can I help you?\" Vixey was a little nervous, she never spoke to a hunter's pet. \"I'm looking... for my husband... and my son...\" This caught Daisy by surprise. \"So- so am I...\" \"You mean, both Coppers are gone?\" Shadow inquisitively asked. Daisy shot Shadow a confused look, so she explained. \"Scoot's fox friend was named after dad.\" Vixey wanted to leave, she worried about the hunters. \"So, you haven't seen my family? I guess this was a waste of time.\" She glanced at Lily. \"Come on Lily, let's go before the hunters come out.\" But Lily stayed put. \"Mom, the hunters aren't home! Can me and Shadow please play together?\" Vixey had a tough decision to make. Her son was allowed to play with his hound friend, so she'd be outed for favoritism if she didn't let her daughter play as well. Vixey sighed, then turned to Daisy. \"Is that alright with you?\" Daisy turned to the two girls, who begged with pleading eyes. \"It wouldn't be fair to Shadow if only Scoot got to play with a fox. I guess it wouldn't hurt for now.\" She turned to Vixey. \"While they play, you and I can get to know each other. Don't cha think?\" \"Uhh.. I.\" Vixey stumbled. \"Sure, ehh why not! What could it hurt? Aha aha.\" She forced a fake smile. Why the hell did I just agree to this? Daisy realized the trick. \"You don't have to fake happiness darlin. I ain't gonna hurt you. Copper is friends with your husband, yes? I wouldn't intend to hurt their mate.\" While the two mothers were talking, Lily and Shadow started to play. \"So, your name's Lily, huh? Makes sense, since the flower is white and orange, like you!\" The white fox smiled. \"And your name is Shadow because your black as the night!\" \"You're right, Lily! Hey, do you know what hunting dogs like to do in their downtime?\" \"What?\" Shadow jumped on top of Lily, tackling her to the ground. \"We like to play fight!\" The fox was a little worried. \"Don't play too hard, ok?\" Shadow laughed. \"I know you're fragile, girl! I've played with your brother too, ya know! I won't hurt you! Just try to get your teeth around my face, but don't bite!\" While the two girls were playing around, roughly, in the yard, the adults were sitting on the side, watching the young ones play, and held their own conversation. \"What's it like living out there, in the woods?\" Daisy asked. Vixey closed her eyes. \"It's peaceful. You hear the birds chirping, the insects buzzing, the trees swaying. The land around you is beautiful. There's rivers, lakes, streams, caves. It's a lot different than out here. Why do you ask?\" Daisy recollected her past. \"I'm from the city. There, everything is loud and obnoxious. No wildlife, no vistas, just concrete from the ground up. Living here is like a mix between the two.\" The hound smiled. \"And that's my past, pretty much. I moved here with the hunter's son, and that's when I met Copper. What about you? What's your past?\" Vixey closed her eyes. \"A foxes life can be a living hell. Especially out here. The second you are born, you have to worry about the hunt. Every single day. My parents were shot dead, and I was all alone for the next month of my life. That was when an owl found me. Her name was big Mama. She took care of me, and made sure my surroundings were safe. She led me to a game reserve, where hunting wasn't allowed. Many months later, I met Tod.\" Vixey paused. \"And I met your husband too, though that was when he was trying to kill us. I'm sure you know about that.\" Daisy nodded. \"I understand our husband's odd relationship, yes. Predator and prey, they were set up from the start. Any more you want to add?\" \"Yes.\" Vixey said. \"I lost my first kids to hunters last year. We were irresponsible first parents. We almost got ourselves killed too. Now, we have our Lily and Copper. I didn't like his name at first, but I think it fits him now, more than ever.\" Daisy sighed. \"I had a litter of six. Scoot was the runt.\" She paused. \"My master wanted to kill him, but his grandson wouldn't let him, so he gave Scoot to him. Alex saved my son. He saved your husband a couple times too. I don't think we have to worry about the issues of the past.\" Daisy leaned toward Vixey. \" He's going to save our sons right now. He took your husband too. Our sons were accused of biting the jerk next door. They were taken to the city to be exterminated.\" Vix ey was shocked. \"You mean, they're going to kill them?\" \"They aren't going to. You just gotta have faith, darlin.\" The two mothers watched, as their daughters played in the yard, breaking the rules that man had enforced on them.[Chapter 29] III Chapter 28: At Death's Door Cap awoke to the sound of the large metal door opening. A man walked through, wearing gloves, and a suit. He unlatched the door to Cap's cage, and grabbed him by the neck. Cap was silent. He didn't even make a fuss. He had given up. As he was carried away, he saw his friend sleeping in his cell, unconscious of the world around him. The man loosened up his grip, and held Cap with two hands. The kit watched, as the large metal door closed behind him, and he was bathed in the light, of the brightly lit corridor. Cap noticed it was quite a long walk to his final resting place. The man holding him looked down at Cap, and felt sorry for the fox. They past a couple signs, Cap couldn't read them, but he noticed that some had familiar writing. He didn't see a single window. At long last, he saw the table he was going to be laid upon, before he would be subjected to eternal sleep. As he looked behind the man, however, something grabbed his attention: there was a floor vent that had no plate attached to it. It wasn't even Cap's will to live, it was just survival instinct. He made sure to stay calm, so that the man didn't tightened his grip, preventing his escape. This is my only chance. Without warning, he pushed his legs against the man, and launched toward the floor. \"Hey!\" The man cried out. \"Get back here!\" The vent was still a couple yards away, so Cap had to book it! The man realized what the fox was trying to do. He ran in front of him, attempting to stop Cap, but the kit dodged around to the right of the man. The fox took one final leap into the vent, and scurried far into it, where he could not longer be seen. Cap searched the vents, for what seemed like hours. He, however, couldn't find where his hound 'friend' was! After more searching, he finally found a vent that overlooked the warehouse style area. He could see the red tag on the cell, and knew it belonged to Scoot. As this was Cap's lucky day, the vent was only held by one loose screw! He loosened it, and kicked the vent, which sent it careening to the floor. The sound of it hitting the floor echoed in the room, waking up the other animals. Cap scaled down the cages, before dropping to the floor, and heading towards Scoot's prison. Since, the cages we're easily unlocked from the outside, Cap simply swiped his finger across the lever, releasing the door of the cage Scoot awoke to the sound of his door opening. \"Come on, let's go!\" Cap ordered. \"Scoot!\" \"Come on, pal!\" For Scoot everything went out. He could no longer hear. He could no longer see. Anything, but Cap. I've got you know, you pest! How foolish of you to save me, because now, it will be. Your. END. Scoot jumped onto Cap. The fox struggled to move, as Scoot dug his nails across Cap's back, causing him to bleed. \"Buster killing you would have been a lot less painful.\"[Chapter 30] III Chapter 29: Friends Forever Cap's back burned. But nothing hurt worse than his friend's betrayal. Scoot held his friend, from long ago, down. \"I'm a hunting dog, Cap. I hurt animals. Why can't you see this was.a bad idea!?\" Cap whimpered. \"You never... Tried ... To... Hurt... Me...\" Scoot growled. \"That was before you cut my sister up.\" He pressed down on Cap's bad leg. Cap didn't scream from the pain. He had to escape somehow. \"I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of causing me pain, Scoot. It's not what friends do.\" Scoot leapt off of Cap, which allowed the fox to run away, towards the vent he opened in the wall. As Cap was scaling the crates back to the vent, the rage was building up inside of Scoot. \"I. AM. NOT. YOUR. FRIEND!\" Scoot screamed, as he climbed the crates to attack his enemy. Cap raced through the vents as fast as he could, going down different directions to confuse Scoot. To his horror, the hound stayed right on his tail. Cap started to Tucker out from all the running. Scoot noticed. \"Eventually you won't be able to run anymore, Cap. A shame, I'd rather fight you when you are at your best, but we all can't get what we want, now CAN WE!?\" Cap continued to run away, through the vents, until he came to a dead end: a drop that lead to the basement of the building. It was sure to be fatal to anything the size of a puppy. Cap frowned at Scoot. \"Looks like this is it.\" The fox panted. \"There's no where for me to run, Scoot. Come. Get. Me.\" Blinded by his rage, Scoot jumped on top of Cap, but was flung, into the direction of the abyss. Scoot grabbed onto the ledge with all his life. He tricked me! What are we doing? What am I doing? We're just kids! I tried to kill my best friend? What is wrong with me? Scoot slipped further down. Everything is wrong with me! I shouldn't exist! I'm a mistake... I'm a mistake... Alex should have let Amos kill me. I'll never amount to anything! I'll never be the best hunting dog! I was lying to myself! Just to make me feel better. I hurt the ones who care about me the most. Cap never tried to kill Shadow! I was stupid. And my stupid should not be allowed in this world... Scoot barely held on to the edge of the vent. Cap doesn't deserve a friend like me. He saved me from drowning in a mud puddle, how pathetic am I? He never gave up on me, even though I treated him like shit. I deserve this. I can't hurt him anymore... Scoot let go of the vent. Cap tilted his head. He couldn't watch his friend die. He wasn't going to watch his friend die. As Scoot was ready to embrace the fall, he closed his eyes. He felt a force keeping him in the air. He opened his eyes and looked up. Cap grabbed onto his paw with his teeth. The fox extended his other paw towards him. \"Bite down on my leg!\" Cap murmured. Frightened, Scoot latched onto Cap's paw, tasting blood. Cap mustered all his strength, and threw Scoot over, and behind him. Scoot landed with a thud, but he wasn't injured. He stared at his friend, who stared right back. The fox was exhausted, and was bleeding from his back, and both paws. They held their gaze for a while. Scoot whimpered. \"I'm.. sorry.. Cap.\" He could only cry. \"Why did you save me?\" The kit could only whisper. He smiled. \"Doesn't matter. I got my friend back.\" Scoot couldn't help but smile. He leapt on top of Cap, and embraced him in a hug. Cap wrapped his front legs around him. Scoot got off of Cap, all covered in blood. He didn't care though, he had to prevent his friend from dying. He needed to find water. He hoisted the barely conscious fox on his back, as he was lighter. After searching for a while, Scoot came to the vent that Cap originally snuck through. It still wasn't covered. Scoot noticed a water cooler next to it. Bingo. Scoot propped his friend against the cooler, while he jumped on to the blue switch, causing water to spill over onto the floor. Scoot jumped down, and woke his barely conscious friend up. \"No dying on me! Drink!\" Cap hesitated, but he was able to place his head on the floor, and lap up whatever he could. It was a pretty big puddle, but both Scoot and Cap were able to finish it. Eventually, Cap was able to walk again, and they both walked back through the vents, to where they could see the warehouse room. They both sat down, next to each other. \"Cap...\" Scoot stuttered. \"There's something you should know about me.\" \"What would that be?\" The fox replied. \"Cap, I was the runt of my siblings. My mom had six in her litter. Four of them got sold, and Amos kept Shadow. The only reason I exist is because Alex begged Amos to let him train me as his own. If it wasn't for him, I would... Have been shot dead.\" Scoot paused. The tears started rolling again. \"I'm a mistake!\" He cried. \"I shouldn't be alive. I hurt you, Cap. I hurt my best friend, because I'm an idiot.\" Cap reflected over his friend's words. \"No, you aren't.\" \"What!?\" \"You aren't a mistake, Scoot. You see, Because of you, I had someone to play with, when my friends were gone. Because of you, our parents got back together. Because of you, Alex has someone he truly cares about.\" Cap smiled. \"But, Scoot, most importantly, because of you, I have a best friend.\" The puppy cried. \"You're right, Cap. You're right.\" Scoot remembered what he said, months ago, before he met Cap. \"I… I… I\"—Scoot started to cry again—\"I want a friend.\" This took the other hounds by surprise. \"What do… you mean by a f… friend?\", curiously asked Chief. Scoot proudly continued, \"Easy. Someone to play with. Someone to run around with. Someone who doesn't care who I am or think I should be. A friend who will understand my problems, and in return I understand theirs. Someone I can count on, to help me in my time of need. In return, I help them. When I'm lonely or sad, that friend would be there to cheer me up!\" Scoot paused for a second, then finished his rambling, \"and THAT is the kind of friend I wish for.\" Copper was shocked. Surely, his son was having a problem with his loneliness. His rant however, made him feel a little uneasy. Finally, copper spoke, \"be careful what you wish for son. A friend that perfect would come with other complications.\" Scoot sighed. \"Copper, you're all I ever wanted as a friend. You are literally the perfect friend. Thanks for cheering me up...\" Cap giggled. \"No problem, buddy.\" It was as if everything would be fine now. The night couldn't possibly get any worse.[Chapter 31] III Chapter 30: A Change of Heart Alex had been writing on his small piece of paper, for a long time. He had to keep erasing his previous steps. At long last, he figured out the code for the following day, he had to wait till midnight though. The two animals he brought with were getting impatient. \"So, he went to the pound, eh?\" Chuckled Amos. \"What makes him think he'll be able to save his puppy?\" \"I don't know pops, but why do you think he brought Copper?\" \"Beats me. Maybe he could find Scoot more easily?\" The hound in the backseat stared out the window. I'm coming for you, Cap. If you happen to escape being euthanized, I will have to take matters in to my own paws. Scoot and Cap searched for an exit. They didn't find one, but they did, however, find another giant room full of cages! This one also had a large security door. Luckily for them, no one was in the building after midnight. The two of them decided to split up. \"Hey, Scoot, look,\" Cap panted. \"We'd have much more luck if we each took a side of the building. I'll go left, you go right!\" \"Sounds good, Cap! We'll meet in the middle then!\" Cap walked all the way down the hall. He then found another large room with cages, but it was empty. There was no door though. He didn't know it, but there were actually four rooms were animals were to be caged, in the shape of a square. Only one was being utilized though. The hallway he was in surrounded the perimeter of the rooms. This place is confusing, he thought. Alex typed in the code he wrote, into the panel on the door. When the door swung open, he moved a rock to keep the door propped open, because the door being opened from the inside would trigger an alarm. Alright, now to figure out where my dog is being held in this labyrinth. The two animals he brought were conspiring. \"We should split up to find our kids!\" Tod said. \"Good idea,\" replied Copper. As the two ran in separate directions down the hallway, Alex could be heard shouting. \"What did I say about running away!?\" Tod ran as fast as he could, down the hallway. He checked every room he could find, but still nothing. As he turned the corner however, he bumped into someone. \"Hey! What's the big ide-,\" Tod paused. Whom he ran into, was a white and brown spotted puppy. \"Tod!?\" The young hound asked. \"Hey kid!\" Tod exclaimed. \"What cha doing all alone?\" \"Me and Cap split up to find an exit. This place is huge, and I can't find him now. I don't even know where we started! Every hallway looks the same!\" \"Chill out, kid! We'll find our way back!\" Copper also happened to bump into someone, far away from the other two. The kit was ecstatic. \"Copper! How did you get here?\" \"Long story, kid. But, we need to meet up with your dad now!\" \"What!? He's here too?!\" \"Yeah, and so is Alex. Now, come on!\" \"Damnit the hell!\" Alex shouted. \"Those damn animals are lost now, because of me!\" He decided to walk outside for a minute, when he saw his grandfather's van. Shit, what are they doing here? He saw his dad, Amos, and his heart sank when he saw the third occupant. They brought that dumb dog too?! The van parked close by. Amos was the first to get out. \"Boy, do you have some splainin' to do! Where's my dog!?\" Alex stumbled. \"I brought him and Tod and they ran away insi-\" \"YOU BROUGHT THAT FLIPPING VERMIN TOO? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?\" Alex screamed at his grandfather. \"Well maybe I care about BOTH the pups that got captured. Recall, that Cap did nothing wrong, and Tod was the one that showed me Jake was lying!\" Alex turned to his father, who was getting Buster out of the van. \"You brought him here to kill the foxes... didn't you?\" Liam smiled. \"We'll see what happens.\" \"I won't let you kill them!\" Alex declared. Liam walked into the pound, and turned back to Alex. \"We'll see what happens.\" Alex was cross with his father, and walked away from him, down the hallway. Liam walked straight into the large room. He found Cap's hat, in one of the cages nearby. \"Seems like they did escape somehow!\" He held the hat, just low enough for Buster to sniff it. \"Go get 'em boy!\" The hound ran off, toward the hallway. Tod and Scoot ran through the facility, hoping to find their friends. As they turned the corner, they saw someone on the other side. Scoot growled. \"Bus-,ter!\" The dark hound ran toward the two of them, but stopped a few yards away. \"Hello, gentleman! I see you're not dead, yet, Tod!\" The fox glared at him. \"I see you have also found a way to get here?\" \"Bwahaha! My owner is here too, Tod! So is Amos! When they find your son, he will be TORN APART!\" Buster's last two words echoed through the halls. Tod growled at Buster. \"I'll stop you!\" The hound walked to a panel on the wall, and laughed. \"This is my home, Tod. Unlike you, I know where everything is. You're outmatched.\" He rammed into the panel on the wall, causing the door between them to descend, and lock shut. Tick tock, little fox. \"What's that sound?!\" Questioned Cap. \"I don't know!\" Copper said. \"Run!\" As they dashed down the hallway, Cap was unable to proceed any further, as the door between him and Copper closed. \"I'm scared Copper!\" Cap shouted through the glass of the door! \"Find some other way around!\" Copper mumbled. \"There might be one!\" Cap frantically searched for any exit, when to his surprise, the door to one of the large empty rooms was opened. He ran into it, trying to see if there were any exits open. No such luck. He froze when he heard a voice coming from the doorway. \"Baited like a fish on a hook!\" Buster hissed. \"I knew you'd fall for the dead end!\" Cap growled. \"What are you doing here!?\" Buster just laughed it off. \"I'm here to kill you.\" He walked toward Cap, noticing the dry blood on his fur. \"My, my, Scoot really did a number on ya. I'm guessing he figured out that I'M the one who hurt Shadow, judging by the fact that YOU are still alive!\" He cornered Cap. The hound smiled. \"I've known your father all his life, Cap. I remember when he evaded me, that one day.\" Cap was horrified. \"Wait, what?\" The hound chuckled. \"His mother carried him, whilst running away from me, and my old owner, Sloth. I guess your dad will never know the truth.\" Busted leaned in toward Cap. \"I killed Tod's mother!\" Cap jumped at Buster, latching onto his back with his teeth. \"Hahahaha! You think your little baby teeth hurt, young man?\" He flung Cap against the wall.\"You don't stand a chance.\" He picked Cap up by the scruff of his neck, and threw him in the center of the floor. \"If you were wise Cap, you'd let me end your suffering.\" \"What... Suffering\" Cap gasped. The hound laughed. \"Your life was over the moment it began! Even if you didn't meet Scoot, you would still be found in the forest, along with your family! Say, maybe I can kill your sister when I return!\" Cap growled, and launched himself at Buster, but the hound just threw him back on the ground. \"Stop trying, you're embarrassing yourself!\" Buster bit down on Cap's injured paw, causing the kit to scream. \"I guess you won't be running away now, you hear?\" Cap wheezed. \"You... murderer...\" Buster chuckled. \"It's not murder if it's nature Cap. Survival of the fittest, obviously not YOU.\" He swiped his nails across Cap's cheek, but he held his mouth shut so he couldn't scream. Buster treated the fox, like he was a chew toy. Every attack, Cap could only whisper in pain, as he was slowly being destroyed. The fox was bleeding heavily, from his back, face, and legs. Cap could only whisper. \"Why are you... doing this to me?\" Something inside Buster snapped. It sounds so familiar... Where have I heard that before. ... No, my friend! I couldn't save her! There was no other choice! She was going to die either way... i did what was best for her... ... A growl from the hallway interrupted Buster's daze. \"Scoot?\" The puppy bore his fangs. \"What. Do you THINK you are doing!\" \"Scoot, you know you can't-\" \"Get away from my friend!\" Scoot inched closer toward Buster. \"Scoot you can't be friends! He's a fox. And you are a hound. You are supposed to kill him! He is a FOX and you are a HOUND!\" Scoot got between Buster and Cap, the envy burning through eyes. \"I don't CARE what HE is!\" The puppy snarled. \"He's my friend! And I'm NOT letting you hurt him any longer!\" Enraged, Scoot bit and clawed Buster. The hound didn't even try to stop him. After a while, Buster was also bleeding heavily, but no where near as bad as Cap. Buster whispered something, but it was inaudible. \"What?\" Scoot asked. \"Spend time with your f- friend.\" Buster stuttered. \"He only has a f- few moments left.\" Scoot turned to face his friend, who was weakened by his loss of blood. Cap could barely move. \"Cap?\" Scoot whispered. \"Scoot.\" \"I want you to know that your my very best friend. Nothing will ever change that.\" In his pain, the kit was able to smile. \"And your mine, Scoot.\" Cap was ready to perish, he had no will left to live. He thought he would never be able to live a normal life. As Cap slowly closed his eyes, the clicking of a gun forced them wide open. The fox stared in horror, as Liam loaded his revolver, and held it pointed at him. Scoot saw that Tod, Copper, Alex and Amos were huddled in the doorway. \"Dad?\" Alex whimpered. \"No!\" Scoot jumped in front of his friend, his front paw wrapped around him. Liam ordered Scoot to move. \"Out of the way, pup! That fox will NOT ruin your hunting performance!\" But Scoot stayed loyal to his friend. \"Scoot?\" Cap whimpered. \"Let him kill me, please. I can't take the pain.\" Scoot started to cry. \"Copper... No! I won't let you go! He's not going to take your hide! I'm not letting anyone touch you Copper... You're- like- a- brother to me!\" The puppy put his paw on the ground, next to his friend, shielding him from any projectiles. Amos noticed the adult fox with Copper, noticing how Copper didn't seem to mind the company. He'd deal with Tod later; he wanted to see how his son would deal with the young one. Liam didn't know how to proceed. He noticed his hound, all beat up on the side of the room. The combination of alcohol and rage was about to burst. \"You nearly killed my dog, because he nearly killed that pest\" He raised the gun at Scoot. \"Dad! No!\" Alex screamed. But Liam ignored him. \"You aren't a hunting dog, Scoot! You're a traitor!\" He put his finger on the trigger. \"And treason warrants death!\" \"No!\" Alex screamed. Copper, Amos and Alex turned away, as the sound of a bullet rang out against the metal walls of the building. Scoot waited for the pain, but it never came. He opened his eyes, and saw who took the fall. It was Tod! The adult fox shivered in pain. He was bleeding from his side, near his right front leg. Liam noticed his work. To him, he didn't feel accomplished. He felt nauseated. Only then, did he realize his mistake. He grabbed Buster, dropped his revolver on the floor, snatched the car keys from Amos' hand, and left. Amos understood everything now. He understood the relationship his hound had with the fox. Alex was telling the truth all along. He stared at Tod, for a while. He didn't even notice that his grandson ran down to the clinic to steal cloth and towels. The retired Hunter noticed that his dog was mourning his friend. The fox was breathing slowly. His eyes opened wide when he saw Amos kneel down before him, but the old man patted his head. \"Shhhhhhhh... everything will be alright.\" Alex returned with supplies, exhausted from his run. He wrapped the baby fox up, putting pressure on his back to prevent anymore blood loss. The boy picked the kit up and cradled him in his arms. Amos reached over to grab the revolver, and pointed it at Tod. \"Should I end his suffering Alex? Or does killing him just prove that I'm the monster...?\" Alex balanced Cap to one arm, and lowered his grandfather's gun with the other. \"Please, no more.\" Amos understood. He checked where the bullet entered Tod's body. To his surprise, it didn't get far. It was lodged in the foxes shoulder. Alex gave Cap to his grandfather, he didn't question it. He took a pair of tweezers from his pile of supplies, and fished the bullet out of Tod's skin. He flung it out the door. \"Grandpa, keep an eye on him, while I patch the little guy up!\" \"Okay... Alex.\" As Alex was treating Cap's wounds, Copper laid down next to Tod. \"You're insane!\" Tod whimpered, \"I wasn't going to let him kill your kid.\" \"It'll be okay, Tod! I question why you would have loyalty to us...\" The fox closed his eyes. \"Copper, you're my very best friend.\" \"You're mine too, Tod.\" \"And we'll always be friends forever, won't we?\" \"Yeah, forever!\" The hound happily replied. He began to worry though, when his friend didn't speak again. He nudged the fox awake. \"You're not dying on me Tod! I know it hurts, but you're son's in worse shape! Stay with me pal!\" \"Copper... All my life, this guy has non-stop tried to end my life. And now he's not. Do you know how freaked out I am right now?\" Tod stuttered. Copper put his paw on his friends shoulder. \"Just chill out, pal.\" Cap was all bandaged up, so he wasn't bleeding as much. Alex was ready to leave, the kit in his arms, and the pup at his feet. He looked down at his grandfather and the fox. \"You can carry Tod.\" He gave Amos a couple towels. \"Put him in the back seat.\" Amos gave Alex a confused look, but he silently did what he was told. Tod was compliant as he was carried through the building and put into the truck. Alex removed the rock, and slammed the pound door shut. He laid Cap gently down in the backseat of his truck, and moved to the front. The two foxes, the two hounds, and the two hunters were now on their way back to the farm. Things would surely be interesting from here on out. Scoot nudged Tod, who was sleeping. \"Hey kid, whaddaya want?\" \"Dad told me you can't sleep, so I'm making sure you don't!\" The fox chuckled. \"I'm fine, kid.\" He leaned over to where his son was looking out the window. \",You should worry more about your friend. \"Tod?\" \"Yes, Scoot?\" \"I'm sorry for almost killing Copper. I didn't know what took control of me! All I could think about was revenge and I-\" \"Shhhhhhhh!\" Tod interrupted. \"It's ok. I knew you guys would come to your senses.\" \"Uhmm... I guess.\" \"Look,\" Tod sternly said, \"You're a good kid, Scoot. I wish you luck on your future endeavors as a hunting dog.\" \"Oh, thanks, To-\" \"You didn't let me finish.\" Tod interrupted. \"Look, the point is, when you come back from your hunts, remember who your friends are. Copper's told me that the taste of fox blood is addicting, and I don't want to see my son torn apart by someone he used to be best buds with.\" Scoot retorted. \"Actually, Tod. Scoot saved me from a fall and told me to bite his paw to help me up. I didn't like the taste of his blood! It felt wrong!\" Tod was a little dismayed. \"It's in your nature, kid. Don't let me stop you. Just... Don't hurt him again... he means everything to me.\" Scoot nuzzled against Tod. \"I won't hurt him again. I promise.\" The two of them drifted off to sleep. Cap was watching the lights go by, outside. They were traveling pretty fast down the highway. He was up against the window, which was slightly rolled down. He heard a voice behind him. \"You should be careful.\" It was Copper! \"Hey Copper!\" Cap whimpered. \"I'm feeling a little better, but my back feels like it's on fire!\" He laughed. But Copper didn't find it amusing. \"We should have a little chat, you know, Copper to Copper.\" The fox lowered himself from the ledge of the door, and have his full attention to Copper. \"Go on.\" Copper sighed. \"You and Scoot... seem to be friends again? Heck! He was crying when he almost lost you.\" Cap wanted to bring up something else. \"Copper, Scoot told me about Alex saving him from being shot. He thinks he's a mistake. I told him how he made life better for all of us though. I'm just worried, when Scoot comes back a hunting dog, will he try to kill me again? You and my dad didn't seem to get along after that...\" Copper laughed. \"I knew your father for a week, Cap. You've known my son for MONTHS! You're friendship is much more stable than ours. I wouldn't worry about it. Heck, I'm the top hunting dog in the state, but I'm not trying to kill you right now am I?\" \"I guess your right, Copper.\" Cap breathed a sigh of relief, and went back to looking out the window. \"I'm a pretty lucky fox to have the opportunity to do this!\" He felt the cool breeze against his face. Copper chuckled. \"Yes you are, Copper! Yes, you are...\" END OF PART III A/N: To all those who have made it this far, thank you very much! Sadly, the story is coming to an end soon, but nothing lasts forever! What is Buster hiding about his past? Will Liam ever except Cap and Scoot's friendship? What will happen to the two friends when they grow up? Find out, in the final section of the Fox and the Hunter![Chapter 32] Part IV: The Fire Chapter 31: Cease-fire When Alex and Amos arrived home, the kit and puppy were eager to get out. Alex stopped by the Widow's house, carrying Cap in his arms. It would take a while for the fox to heal. Alex rang the doorbell, and Tweed immediately opened her door. She noticed the fox in Alex's arms. \"Uh, good morning, Alex. What brings you here?\" Alex looked down at the fox in his arms. \"This little guy needs someone to take care of him. My dad's hound did quite the work.\" Tweed was confused. \"What makes you think I can help that thing get better?\" Alex leveled his eyes with the Widow, and smiled. \"You raised his father, I think you in what you're doing!\" Still, Tweed couldn't understand. \"Why don't you help it?\" Alex sighed. \"I gotta watch over it's father. Copper here needs to be in safety, away from the hounds for a couple days.\" He reached Cap out, towards Widow. Widow grabbed the fox, and coddled him in her arms. \"My, aren't you cute little Copper! You remind me of someone...\" Alex smirked. \"He reminds you of Tod, doesn't he?\" Widow gasped. \"This is Tod's son? Oh my! Where is he now?\" \"He saved my puppy today, so I wanna make sure he's alright. My dad shot him in the shoulder.\" Widow frowned. \"And your grandfather is okay with you doing this?\" Alex said, \"Ms. Tweed, my grandfather is alright with me helping Tod. He allowed me to take him back home in my car. I don't think he'll hurt him.\" The kit turned over and tried to paw Widow's face. \"I think he likes you,\" said Alex, \"I think you guys will get along just fine!\" Alex heard his grandfather calling him from the van. \"I gotta go! Take care of little Copper!\" As Alex drove off, Widow closes the door, and placed Cap on the floor. The kit limped to the kitchen. \"Are you hungry?\" The old lady asked. \"I'll get you something special!\" As Widow cooked breakfast, for her and Cap, the fox patiently waited on the floor. She glanced down at the fox, and smiled. You're well behaved! Just like your dad... shame what happened to him though. I do find it strange that Amos hasn't hunted you guys down, but I know that old goon isn't completely cold-hearted! Widow dropped what she was cooking on the floor, for Cap. The kit was filled with joy, as he tasted what it was. Bacon! When Amos arrived at home with Alex, he was shocked to see a white kit sleeping next to his black puppy. He turned to Alex. \"That kit is beautiful!\" Alex knew what his grandfather was thinking. \"Don't you think about killing it for your collection! It's probably Tod's kit, for all we know.\" Amos groaned. \"Does it really matter, Alex?\" \"Yes, it does matter! Maybe Shadow enjoys the company of that fox, you don't know!\" Amos grumbled, but didn't say a word. He had to deal with the injured fox in his arms. He opened the back door to his barn, and laid Tod down on a Pile of hay. He then shut the door, and left. Tod turned over on his side, as pain shot up from his shoulder. This was the most comfortable he could make himself. He almost fell asleep, when he was shook back awake. \"Well, well, well.\" Tod raised his head and saw who his assailant was. It was Chief! The hound was inches away from Tod. \"Now you know how it feels when you can't move your leg!\" He shouted at Tod. \"Because that's how I've felt, for the past couple of years, all because of you!\" Tod sighed. \"Chief, look, I'm sorry for causing you to get hit by a train. I never intended you to get hurt, I was just scared! Do whatever you want to me, but please don't take your anger out on my family... Please!\" The hound took a step back and reconciled. He sighed. \"I'm not going to hurt your kid, Tod. It would make Scoot mad at me, and our relationship is already Rocky.\" Tod gave Chief a sarcastic look. \"Really? You aren't going to hunt my kid?\" Chief walked over to the barn window and put his head down. \"I'm retired Tod. I'm not a hunting dog anymore. It was inevitable. I would say you sped up that process, but even when I was training Copper, I fell behind. Two years later really makes an impact on things.\" The fox sighed. \"I get where your coming from, Chief, I totally do. But you haven't exactly been kind to me in the past.\" Chief glared at Tod. \"Because you're a fox, Tod. I've killed your kind in the past. But now, I'm told to hold back on my instincts. The longer I've been out of service, the easier it becomes. You teach that kit of yours to stay away from Amos' chickens, you shouldn't have a problem.\" \"What do you mean no problem? Amos is reluctantly helping me, because of his grandson.\" Chief chuckled. \"That may be true, but I heard what you did, Tod. You saved my nephew today. I respect you for that. So, I'm allowing you to rest peacefully, till your better. Once that happens, I'll be more aggressive towards you 'pests'. Tod cracked a smile. \"I guess you're not too bad, Ol' Chief.\" Chief smiled. \"This is merely a Cease-fire, Tod. Learn your boundaries. You may not believe this, but as a friend of Copper, I do not want to see you get shot.\" Chief walked out of the room. The fox lay his head down on the hay, and drifted off to sleep. Alex and Amos sat down on the back porch, watching the white fox play with Shadow. Alex noticed that the kit seemed to have more energy than Cap, but she wasn't as quick. He saw Vixey next to Daisy, which were also watching their children. \"Hey Grandpa, what do you think of those two over there. That must be the mother, right?\" Amos glanced over, and saw what Alex was talking about. He sighed. \"I remember that fox from the reserve, that's Tod's mate alright. But I'll tell you one thing, Alex.\" \"What's that grandpa?\" \"You were right about Copper and Tod. I didn't believe it at first, but when Tod protected Scoot from your father, I knew something was up. Copper was crying when Tod was bleeding out. Turns out the friendship bullshit is true.\" Alex grinned. \"So you aren't gonna hunt these foxes anymore, right?\" Amos smirked. \"I'll tell you what, Alex. As long as those foxes stay away from my chickens, I won't shoot 'em.\" Alex smiled. \"That's good enough for me!\"[Chapter 33] IV Chapter 32: Trapped in a Nightmare The door to the barn opened. Tod's leg was sore, and he couldn't move. He watched as a shadowy figure approached him. It was Amos, who had something in his hand. The old man dropped to one knee, and spoke softly. \"I understand Alex wants me to keep you alive, but I'm a hunter and you've been my biggest problem.\" Tod heard a clicking sound, and he figured out what Amos was holding in his hands. Amos shoved the shotgun into Tod's stomach. The fox was immobilized. The Hunter patted Tod. \"All I ever wanted was your coat, you VERMIN! It took two years for me to achieve this. Good riddance, pest!\" The sound of a gunshot rang out. Tod awoke, completely freaked out. He looked around the barn, frantically trying to find an exit. Luckily, the main door was open. He charged outside as fast as he could, but stumbled and fell when his leg failed to move. It was now daytime. Alex walked over to the frenzied fox. Tod tried to get away, but he was stuck in a bush! Instead, he whined and shook, completely afraid of the two hunters. Copper noticed his troubled friend and ran across the yard to his side. \"Tod, what's gotten into you?\" The fox stuttered. \"I can't stay here, Copper! They're going to kill me! Amos wants my hide, you know that!\" The hound giggled. \"Tod, you had a Nightmare, didn't you?\" Tod whimpered. \"Yes.\" \"Amos isn't going to hurt you! Do you understand how much Alex cares about you and Cap? He wouldn't do that to his grandson.\" Tod sighed. \"I guess you're right, Copper. I really need to chill.\" Alex picked Tod up from the bush and laid him back down on the grass. He patted his head, and walked back to his grandfather. The fox and the hound didn't notice that Buster was walking toward them. When he arrived, Copper growled, but Buster brushed it off. \"I'm not going to kill you Tod,\" Buster said. \"I just want to talk.\" Copper growled and inched toward him. \"You aren't going NEAR him!\" \"Copper, Tod needs to know the truth!\" Buster leapt over Copper, and rammed into Tod. Now, Alex was watching closely, from a distance. Copper sat between Tod and the black hound. Tod groaned. \"You almost killed my son, yesterday! Why should I trust you?\" Buster sighed. \"He said something an old friend of mine once said, and it came back to haunt me.\" \"Go on...\" Said Tod. \"There's two parts, Tod. I want your son to be here the longer part, but you need to know something.\" Tod rolled his eyes. \"Why does he need to be here?\" \"Because, Tod. Scoot and little Copper need to know my story. It requires all of you.\" \"So, what's this small part?\" Questioned Tod. Buster recalled his past. \"One day, me and my hunter Sloth were hunting in this here forest. We came upon a field. There was a fox, carrying her kit in her mouth. My hunter gave chase. I had no choice but to follow. Eventually, the mother dropped her child off far from harm, and came back to throw the trail off her offspring. You.\" Tod had conflicted thoughts running through his mind. \"Wait a minute...\" \"That Owl saved you, Tod.\" Tod connected all the pieces together. \" You killed my mother!\" He attempted to charge at Buster, but Copper held him down. Tod was enraged. \"He's a murderer, Copper! Let me get him!\" Copper lectured his friend. \"We are supposed to kill you game animals, Tod. It happ-\" \"No!\" Buster interrupted. \"I am a murderer!\" The black hound started crying. Tod mocked, \"What's wrong with you?\" Buster walked away, and replied. \"Gather your families. Tonight, you will understand everything.\" Tod turned to his friend. \"Did you... know about this?\" Copper shook his head. \"No, Tod! He never told me anything!\" Tod looked off into the distance. \"He did seem pretty upset.\" Cap scratched at the door. He wanted to go outside! The Widow frowned. \"You do seem to be acting like you're better, but you don't look like you're better!\" Cap whined. The Widow sighed. \"Alright! I'll let you out, and I'll go over to Amos' for his bonfire. Remember, I'm keeping an eye on you!\" The second the Widow opened her backdoor, a white and brown spotted puppy careened into Cap, then started licking his face. \"Oh my!\" Said the window. \"I'm shocked to see that Alex's hunting dog is getting along with you!\" She walked across the yard, to Amos house. The old man greeted her. \"Howdy, Tweed! How's that little critter doing? Widow glared at him. \"You better not be thinking of harming this little one! Why the sudden change of heart?\" Amos giggled. \"It's a long story!\" I'll fill you in tonight. For now, I'm cooking some burgers if you want one!\" Widow smiled. \"That's awfully nice of you, Amos, I'd be delighted to!\" Cap limped with Scoot, to the side of the house. A hound was waiting for them. \"Buster?!\" Scoot shouted. \"You better leave him alon-\" Scoot and Cap noticed the hound was in tears. \"Aww, did the big mean hound get hurt?\" Cap teased. Buster gazed at him. They have the same eyes. The resemblance is uncanny. \"I want both of your families by the bush tonight. You need to hear my story. No, I'm not going to attack you Cap. You remind me of someone I once knew.\" \"Aww, that's so flattering!\" Cap mocked. \"Why should I trust you?\" The older hound turned away from them. He started crying again. \"You... Can't \". He then turned to Scoot. \"Your girlfriend has the same name as her. \" \"Who?\" Inquired Scoot. But the hound just walked away. It was now evening, the bonfire was set, and the foxes and hounds were gathered near the bush, waiting for Buster's story. Everyone was there: Tod, Vixey, Cap, Lily, Copper, Daisy, Scoot, Shadow, and Buster. Liam was farthest from the group, Alex would not allow him near them. All three hunters were quite surprised that all of the animals were near each other, though. Alex was shocked to see that even Buster wasn't causing problems. Tod tapped his paw on the ground. \"So, what are we waiting for?\" Buster closed his eyes. \" Everyone has a story. This is mine\".[Chapter 34] Chapter 33: Ann Buster continued. \"I was born, far from here. I do not remember who my parents were. I do remember when I was taken from my home, however. A hunter bought me, his name was Sam Aloth. Call him 'Sloth'. I've only told Tod this, but I am the one who murdered his mother. Yes, I said it was murder. Sam had other hound dogs, who I will refuse to name. They hated me. I'm not sure why. It could have been because I was younger than them, and less experienced. I did eavesdrop on them a couple times though. One conversation stood out in particular: Hey, did you hear that some little girl lost their pet fox in the forest? No way, dude! That's like a free kill! I became enraged. Who could be so heartless to kill someone's pet? I told them off. It may be a fox, but it belongs to someone, why would you kill it?! They mocked me. Buster, Buster, ahh Buster. One day, you will learn your place in the world, and that you can't be remorseful towards those pests! Or are you just going to be a useless hound dog? Hahahaha.. All three of them laughed at me. I learned really quickly, that morals weren't valued in nature. One day, however, my owner left for the day, somewhere. He never put us on a leash, and he was fairly kind to us. I decided to search around the forest, I wanted away from those creeps. As I was walking through the forest, I could have sworn I saw a pair of eyes. Hello? I said. I walked toward where I saw that face pop out from, and heard a voice. P- p- please don't eat me little hound dog! I just want to go home! It was a girl's voice! I found who it belonged to, on the other side of a tree. There, hid a kit, not much bigger than Cap, who was shivering in fear. I could tell she did not enjoy my company. I tried to comfort her. I'm n- not gonna hurt you! I just saw you, and was curious what you were. Are you lost? My name's Buster! Nice to meet you! The fox crawled out of her spot, and extended her paw to meet mine. I'm Anne! Or Ann, without the e. My owner dropped me off in the forest! I don't know why! What do you mean? I asked Anne. She told me about how her owner had a mother who raised foxes for many years, and they became more tame to her over time. Her owner was allowed to raise one of them, and she raised her. One day, apparently, her brother got a hound dog, and things did not go alright. So, she had to be dropped off, in the forest, to live like a wild animal. But, she was scared. But me and her got along well. In fact, I'd sneak into the forest, every day. We would run, wrestle, you name it. It was quite the exercise. I got faster, stronger, and smarter by hanging out with Ann. One day, when my owner was away, my 'rivals' followed me into the forest. They attacked her. Being the brave puppy that I was, I attacked them. I hurt them. They were scared, and they should have been. They understood, that I was not going to let them touch my friend. So, they feared me. They never teased me again. One day though, one of the puppies said something that would stick with me, for the rest of my life. What if you're the one that kills her? And I realized that, our friendship could be no more. But, I kept hanging out with Ann, in the forest. One night we laid down in the field. This next part is eerie, I can't believe it actually happened. We were laying on the grass, staring at the stars. Ann, we're just a bunch toddlers! We don't understand that this is wrong. Ann sighed. Toddlers? Tod. I like that name... We can't be friends forever, Ann! I don't want to hurt you. She hugged me. Buster, you're the greatest friend I ever had! I know you won't hurt me! That night has been in my mind, ever since. The next day however, was the beginning of hunt training. I waved goodbye to my friend, and she saw me leaving on the truck, with tears in her eyes. Six months later, after the hunt, we were both full grown. One day, I decided to visit her. I was met with the face of a male fox. He wouldn't let me see her! Until, she asked who I was. I saw her. We both stared at each other. She was an adult fox. I hunted adult foxes during training! I would never hurt her though. She walked up to me. So you're a big mean hunting dog now, hey Buster? I told her to stay in the forest, and she would be safe. She told me the male fox was her mate. He was very suspicious of me, but she explained to him that I was her friend. For a while after that, I didn't see her. I became the best hunting dog out of all the fools, and Sloth sold them to someone else. One day however, my master followed me into the forest. He thought I was tracking game, I didn't even notice him! I found the spot where Ann and her mate lived. There, was a beautiful sight. Four kits, all sleeping in a log, just careless of the whole world. Ann saw me, and she smiled. We had four boys and a girl! Aren't they adorable, Buster? I tried to reply, but I heard the clicking of a shotgun. Good boy, Buster! You found an entire family of coats! RUN! I yelled at Ann. She noticed the hunter, grabbed one of her kids, and took off. I don't think she forgot about the others, but she had to save one. Ann ran, far away, near where we are now. I watched, as my master killed her mate and family. The rage was building up. They were innocent. I only hoped Ann got away safely. Something else was building up inside me though: pride from killing game. I had two conflicting feelings. I wanted to kill Ann and her kit, but I also wanted to save her. I found her alright. She was waiting for me. The look of horror was in her eyes. She was crying. I was angered though. Her kit was missing, and I couldn't kill it! I was mad! I shook her on the ground. Where is the kit? She cried. Why are you doing this to me? Cap said it the other day. Her last words. She lost everything. She gave up. I owned this. I fucked up. I wouldn't give my hunter the satisfaction of killing my friend! So, I snapped her neck. I watched, as the life faded from my friend's body. I killed her. I killed her. Not that fucking bastard who trained me. I was so enraged, watching my friend die, I bit him. I bit down hard on his puny little hand. I was sent to the pound, and now we catch up to the present. Everyone has a story. Now, you know mine.\" Everyone was in shock. Tod spoke up. \"But Widow named me T-\" \"Yes, Tod.\" Buster interrupted. \"But it was eerie regardless.\" \"Hold on!\" Copper exclaimed. \"You mean to tell me that Tod's mother was a pet? Like his family hasn't been wild?\" Buster nodded. \"That is correct. It's why these foxes are so tame.\" \"You knew my mother...\" pondered Tod. \"And you wanted to kill me, why?\" Buster sighed. \"Because I don't want to think about her anymore! Killing you and your kids would mean her family is gone. I see her face in Cap, Tod. It drives me insane.\" Cap smirked. \"So, you're the first fox and hound, huh? Dad wasn't the first, you were!\" Buster rolled his eyes. \"I guess so. Hey there's one more part I forgot.\" \"What is it?\" \"Ann's owner got another pet. I recognized her during the barbecue weeks ago. She named it after her.\" Buster turned to Scoot. \"Annie.\"[Chapter 35] III Chapter 34: An Unexpected Tragedy While Tweed and the Slade's were enjoying the bonfire, the boy next door was planning his next move. I didn't kill the dog. What the hell happened? I thought they were killed at the pound. And I can see that fucking fox made it too. All of those animals are peacefully laying around. What the fuck is going on? ... I'm sick of this fucking family. I'll. I'll kill one of them! They won't know! And it will be too late! Jake snuck towards Amos' house. He had kerosene and a match. This house is so old, I don't even think it has a smoke detector! I'll burn this place down, and that old fucker will die. Then maybe, Alex will move the fuck away from me! I gotta wait till they go to bed. Amos decided to call it a night, which prompted everyone to go home. He decided to take Buster in to his home, as he didn't exactly trust his son with him yet. As the old man went to sleep, he could have sworn he smelled smoke. Alex didn't want to go home, so he slept on Amos' couch, with his puppy in his arms. His grandfather allowed him inside for just one day. The remaining pets and foxes we're still outside. Buster and Tod were conversing. Buster looked over to Cap, Shadow, and Lily. \"I don't have any friends. She was my only friend. Is it worth living? When everyone you know hates you?\" Tod replied. \"I don't really hate you, now. I know the truth, that's all that matters.\" Vixey butted in, \"you could always make new friends, right?\" Daisy smiled. \"That shouldn't be too tough?\" Buster groaned, til his groaning became an agitated growl. \"No matter what, that moment will never leave my head. It's slowly killing me. I'm going to end it one-\" \"Don't say that!\" Yelled Lily. \"Why would you hurt yourself?\" Buster chuckled, forcefully. \"Kid, there's some things you don't yet understand. For instance, there is no such thing as a 'bad guy'. There is always a reason for their actions. If I had to, I'd jump off the train bridge. It's easy, when you are being tormented by the ghosts of your past.\" Copper looked up at the moon. \"I think it's time for bed, kiddos.\" \"Awwwwww!\" The three pups whined in unison, which caused Copper to smile. Daisy licked Shadow. \"come on now! Off to bed! It's time for your friends to dream of chasing rabbits through the woods, and for you to dream of chasing foxes...\". Daisy paused. \"Uhh, how should I end this, honey?\" The group laughed. Tod smirked. \"How about, just go to bed kids.\" Daisy agreed. \"Yeah, that's better!\" Tweed was watching the family of foxes from her home. She saw Todd, which instantly provoked a smile to form on her lips. She decide that Cap would be fine with his father, so she went inside, and got to bed. Todd was curled around his son, and Vixey did the same to Lily. The foxes were sleeping next to the tall grass surrounding the pond. Todd knew he was safe at Amos' for now, but being so close to the forest made him feel safer. He didn't go back to his home, because he didn't know if Cap would make the distance with the poor condition of his legs. The hounds were in their respective doghouses, next to the bonfire pit. Scoot was inside, with Alex. Liam wasn't asleep. He was sitting in his son's bedroom, watching the nocturnal animals outside. He still wanted Cap's hide, but for now, he just tucked his pistol in his pocket. A shadowy figure walked with a torch, to his neighbors house. He set it against the old wood, until the flame caught on to the house. Only a matter of time! Cap saw a light in the distance. Curious, he sidestepped his father, without waking him up. He limped toward the source of light. The boy holding the torch formed an evil grin. \"Well, look who it is! I thought you and that dog died, but I guess not!\" Jake picked Cap off the ground, and held his muzzle shut. He then swing his arm back, and threw Cap on the ground. The fox whined, and tried to run away, only to fall on his feet. The boy kicked the fox in the head, knocking it out. \"I hope you don't wake up from that, heheheh.\" Jake walked back to his house, to observe the destruction that would be soon to follow. 20 minutes later. Alex opened his eyes. It was very hard to breathe, he noticed. Then he saw it. The room he was in was engulfed in flames. Panicked, the boy ran to his grandfather's room, and tried to wake him up. \"Grandpa! Let's go! The house is on fire!\" Amos, startled awake, jumped out of bed. Forgetting about their two hounds, the two ran out the back door, only to see Liam, rushing to the burning building. Liam shouted, \"what in the blazes happened!? And where is Buster and Scoot?\" Alex cried. \"I don't want my puppy to die!\" Liam spoke calmly. \"I'll go save him. It's not like you think too highly of me, anyway; if anything were to happen to me.\" Liam rushed into the house. \"Dad! No!\" Alex screamed. Cap awoke. He saw the burning building, and freaked out. Scoot and Alex are in there! He noticed there was a hole created by the fire, just large enough for him to squeeze through. As Cap squeezed into the hole, he could see Liam on the other side, unaware of his presence. The man was trying to get through a pile of rubble, in which dogs were heard barking on the other side. Then, Cap saw it. There was a square gap, that a dog would be able to duck through. He thought he might be able to drag Scoot through it. Wasting no time, he ran with the pain in his legs, over to the gap. Liam noticed the fox, and took out his pistol. Cap was now on the other side. He was frantically searching for his friend, as his sense of smell was impacted by the smoke. He turned through a doorway, and found his old nemesis. Buster had the puppy in his mouth. The black hound was in tears. \"You need to get him out of here! Save him!\" The beam above the doorway creaked. Buster ran to the doorway, and dropped Scoot on the ground, outside the doorway. The puppy was shaking. The fox and the black hounds eyes locked. They shared a mutual smile. The beam above the doorway started to crack. Buster noticed, and picked Cap up, and threw him out of harms way. The rubble collapsed on top of him. \"No!\" Shouted Cap. \"Buster!\" Scoot cried. The hound showed no expression of worry. \"Cap.\" He weakly whispered. Cap turned his face directly at the trapped hound, a tear dropping down his face. Buster smiled, as more rubble fell on top of him. \"No!\" Cap screamed. \"Buster, NO!\" The fox screamed at the ceiling. It was the first death that had an impact on him. \"He was misguided! But he was trying to become better! He didn't have to die!\" Scoot nudged him. \"We have to go?!\" The fox and hound ran to the gap between the pile of wood, and the floor. Liam was waiting on the other side. The fox ran under it, as fast as he could. As Scoot was crawling through, however, the pile shifted downwards, trapping the puppy. Liam clicked his pistol. Cap knew he was about to die. He could either let Liam shoot him, and be a coward, or attempt to free his friend from the pile. He chose the latter. Cap grabbed Scoot's paw, with his teeth, and pulled as hard as he could. Eventually, Scoot was able to become unstuck. Scoot turned back to his friend. Then he saw Liam. \"Run!\" Cap screamed. \"But, Copper!\" \"RUN!\" The pile now fell to trap Cap. As the puppy ran out of the house, Liam watched. He turned back to Cap, who had his mouth open, horrified of what was to happen. The fox closed his eyes, and relaxed. Liam stared at Cap, his finger on the trigger. Why couldn't he fire? Liam contemplated the scenario. The fox just saved Scoot from being crushed, was it right to kill it? Liam held his pistol in his arm. Slowly, he lowered the gun. The rest of the family was outside. Widow Tweed comforted Alex. \"You're father may not always do the right thing, Alex. But he loves you, and knows you would have risked your life.\" Suddenly, a white and brown spotted puppy ran towards Alex. The boy looked down toward Scoot and smiled. He then. Remembered his father was inside, as the wood above the doorway fell, trapping anyone inside. \"Dad!\" Alex screamed. For a few moments everyone was silent. Then, the sound of wood being moved came from the door. Eventually, the doorway was unobstructed again. Amos, Alex and Tweed watched, as a shadowy figure emerged from the door. It was Liam! But, he also held something in his arms. Alex's eyes widened. Did he kill... Liam somberly walked towards the fox family, with the young fox in his arms. As he was walking, Scoot was running along side him, trying to get to his friend. The hunter tossed the fox on the ground, next to it's father. Liam walked back to the other three people. Liam and Alex stared at each other. What happened next, surprised everyone. Alex ran towards his father, and wrapped his arms around him. The father held his son tightly, while patting his head. Alex released his dad. He cried. \"I love you, dad. I know you sometimes go off your rocker and do things that I don't agree with, but it doesn't change the fact that you care about me, and believe in me.\" Liam had tears streaming down his face. \"I know, Alex. I'm done with drinking.\" Alex turned, to where he could see the foxes. He saw Cap on the ground, and ran over to him. His father followed. Scoot was shaking his friend. \"No, Cap! You're my best friend! You can't be dead! You just can't be...\" He cuddled up against his friend's body, his tears staining the fur. The kit coughed a couple times, and his eyes slowly opened. Scoot got off his friend's body, and stared into his eyes. The fox turned over, and saw Alex and Liam, staring down at him. \"Why did you save him?\" Alex asked. Liam chuckled. \"Those two care about each other, and I know it would devastate both you and you're puppy if I killed that kit.\" \"But...,\" Alex stuttered, \"What about Scoot's hunting capabilities being ruined?\" Liam put his arm around Alex and smirked. \"The hell with it!\" Cap remembered what happened to Buster, and was saddened. \"Dad, Buster is really dead now, isn't he?\" Tod nuzzled his son. \"Yes, unfortunately. He wanted to go though.\" Copper and Chief ran over to the group. Chief inspected Scoot. \"Thank goodness you're okay!\" He then walked over to Cap. \"How are you doing?\" The kit looked up at Chief, with tears in his eyes. \"He's upset about Buster,\" Tod said. Chief sighed. \"It's what he wanted, Cap. Buster was always depressed.\" Cap faced the ground. \"He saved me from the rubble. Then, he wanted to stare at my face. I reminded him of Ann he said...\". Chief inquired. \"Uhh, who's Ann?\" Copper replied. \"Tod's mother.\" She was his only friend. Then he was forced to kill her.\" Chief was shocked. \"He was friends with a fox? You'd never know...\" Scoot mumbled, \"And Annie's owner was Tod's mom's owner.\" Chief ridiculed, \"So these foxes go way back then. Tod's not wild. You guys are all pets!\" Tod humbly replied. \"I liked my time with the Widow, but the forest is my home! I wouldn't change it for the world...,\" He turned to Vixey. \"I wouldn't have ever met her, without you.\" Chief chuckled. \"It took me falling off a bridge for you to find love, Tod? Seems like everything does happen for a reason.\" The two shared a laugh. Cap looked up at Liam, who seemed to realize that his dog wasn't coming back. He limped over to Scoot, and whispered something in his ear. Scoot nodded. The two of them ran, to the burnt out rubble that was once Amos' home. They climbed, to the highest point. No one on the ground below knew what they were up to. All eyes were on them, regardless. Cap and Scoot were back to back. \"You ready, pal?\" Cap asked. \"Ready!\" Confirmed Scoot. With perfect choreography, the two lifted their heads up to the sky, and each howled at the moon, mourning the tragic death of the hound. It was the perfect act of respect. The perfect act of friendship. A/N: Alright, so my writing has come a long way since I finished this story. I am planning to make it quite a bit darker, so expect a rewrite (If I feel like it).[Chapter 36] IV Chapter 35: Growing Up Tod and Vixey watched, as their children played with their hound friends down below. Now in the safety of the Slade's yard, the kids had nothing to worry about. Widow and the Slade's watched the critters from Liam's new patio. Chief, Daisy, and Copper were sitting on the edge, making sure to step in if the children got too rough. Cap was the happiest kit in the world. Now, his sister and Shadow join the two boys for their daily shenanigans. It had been a couple weeks since the incident, and Cap's leg was fully healed. He could run circles around his friends! They couldn't catch him! He donned a new hat, this time it was black. Alex asked Widow to make him another one, and she happily obliged. On the front of it, in white letters, spelled \"COPPER\". It was still a couple months until the hunting season began; the time when. Scoot and Shadow would leave for their trip. As the two kits were playing, Amos noticed his old enemy on the hill. He decided to get up and walk to him. Tod watched, as Amos made his way toward him. He was a little startled, when the hunter sat next to him. After a while, Tod realized Amos was being peaceful, so he laid down next to him. The hunter put his hand on the foxes upper back. The two glanced at each other. Amos sighed. \"Seems like even though we're supposed to be at each other's throats, we still have one thing in common. Family. You're just makin' sure those kits of yours are safe, while I'm makin' sure I got enough money t' provide for them.\" Amos put his hands in his lap, and watched the pups playing down below. \"You seem to care about Copper's kin too. If it weren't for you, Alex's puppy would be dead.\" The fox put his paws on Amos' lap. The man chuckled. \"Don't get all cuddly with me. You're still a pest! But I see no value of killing you anymore. You don't deserve it.\" The hunter got to his feet. \"I know you can't understand me, but I'll say it anyways: I won't hurt your family, as long as you don't hurt mine.\" Tod watched Amos slowly walk away. He couldn't help but smile. Scoot was exhausted from running around. Cap stopped in his tracks. \"Aww come on, hunting dog!\" He mocked. \"How ya gonna outrun those animals ya gotta catch, if ya don't have enough energy to keep up with a little fox?\" Scoot panted. \"Not. Everyone. Is as fast. As. You.\" He collapsed next to Chief. The old hound chuckled. The two girls were also laying down. Chief didn't seem to mind Lily, as she was mostly calm. Copper noticed Tod watching down him, so he trekked up the hill. It was a lot farther then it looked! He sat next to his old fox pal. They shared a mutual smile. Both of them stared toward their kids. \"Whoever knew this would happen?\" Copper asked. \"I mean, our kids are playing together, and no one cares! The foxes and hounds aren't enemies!\" Tod sighed. \"But I'm worried about the future.\" \"Whaddya mean?\" \"Scoot and Shadow are going on a hunting trip soon, yes?\" \"Uhh yeah, why?\" Tod turned to his friend. \"You changed after the hunt.\" Copper groaned. \"Oh, come on Tod! Scoot and Shadow aren't going to hurt Copper and Lily! They've known each other for a while, trust me!\" Vixey was keeping a close eye on her daughter. \"She's going to be a target when she's older.\" Copper shook his head. \"Nah, Alex isn't gonna let any harm come to your children. He loves them.\" Down below, Alex could be seen holding Cap. \"He also vaccinated her, so it would be a waste to kill her.\" Copper continued. Alex picked up Lily and put her on his other shoulder. \"Your kids love him too.\" Vixey started to calm down, when her kits fell asleep in Alex's arms, and he started to bring them towards her. When Alex got to the top, he was exhausted. \"Gee, Tod- you really+ picked a far spot to- scout, huh?\" He placed the two kits on the floor, who ran to their parents. The boy sat in the edge of the hill, next to the mother fox. Vixey was anxious. \"Uhh... This guy thinks he can just sit next t-\" Her words were cut short, when Alex started scratching her head. She rolled next to him. Cap giggled. \"Feels good, doesn't it mama?' Vixey rolled her eyes. \"I guess.\" The six of them didn't notice the two puppies who snuck up on them. Scoot tackled Cap. \"Hey wha!\" The fox cried. \"Scared ya, didn't I?\" The puppy jeered. Cap stuck out his tongue. \"Maybe!\" As he kicked Scoot off of him. \"Calm down guys!\" Yelled Copper. \"Just sit down and shut up!\" \"But daddy!\" Whined Scoot. \"Shut up!\" Shouted Tod. \"We're trying to talk without you yahoos interrupting us!\" Eventually, the younger animals laid down next to Alex, who was gazing down at his grandfather's farm. A new home was being built for him. Widow glanced up, and saw Alex with the fox family. She smiled when she saw Tod, who turned to face her. She could of sworn that he winked at her. Alex picked Cap up, and held him in his arms. The Kit's green eyes were open wide, staring at the boy's face. Alex closed his eyes, as he held the fox closer. \"I'll never hurt you guys. Ever. You're part of my family now.\" Scoot leapt into his owners arms, covering his face in slobber. Until the sunset, the young Hunter and his hounds sat with the foxes, of whom was supposed to be their prey.. Two months later. It was time for Scoot and Shadow to learn how to properly hunt. Scoot was pacing by his friend. \"Cap, if you don't want me to go, I won't! Alex will understand!\" The fox just smirked. \"Scoot, No! This is who you are! I'm not stopping you!\" The hound gulped. Well I wasn't expecting that! \"Scoot!\" Alex's voice called. Both the fox and the hound ran out toward the hunter's truck. \"Wait!\" Cap shouted. The hound stopped, and turned around to face his friend. \"What!?\" The fox pleaded. \"Remember me.\" Scoot was confused. \"I'm not going to forg-\". He realized what his friend meant now. He gave Cap a reassuring smile. \"I will remember you. Our encounters in the future will be no different than they are now!\" Alex and Liam were in the car with their puppies, Copper, Daisy and their hunting equipment, ready for the next couple months of training. The boy gave a quick wave to the foxes, then the truck sped away. As Scoot watched his friend wave to him as he left, his words echoed in his head. Remember me. Time has a way of changing things... It was now the end of winter. A grown up fox emerged from his family's burrow. His new brothers and sisters were still asleep. He perched himself on the hill, waiting desperately for the day his friend would be back. The old hound down below woke up. Cap decided to run down to him. \"Hey buddy!\" The fox exclaimed. The hound looked none too happy. \" Is that... you, Cap!? Cap smirked at Chief. \"What gave it away? It couldn't have been the hat I've worn for all eternity, could it?\" Chief groaned. \"You're much brighter than your meddlin' father, actually. What are you doing here, anyway?\" \"Waiting for my old pal, what do you think.\" Chief processed what he said, then proceeded to roll on the floor laughing. \"What's so funny?\" \"You- think that Scoot- won't tear you- up? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\" The fox frowned. \"Uh... I know he wont!\" The hound ended his giggling. \"Whatever, kid. You're fair game now. You aren't the cuddly kit you used to be!\" Cap was about to respond, when he heard a noise in the distance. Chief smiled. \"Let's see how this goes now!\" The sound of Alex's engine roared from the street, as it eventually parked in the yard. As the boy for out, he saw Cap on the other side of the yard. He wasn't smiling though. Liam lifted the large case that held all the skins from the trip. He set it in his garage. Copper and the now grown up hounds exited the vehicle. Scoot faced his master. Until he heard a voice. \"Scoot!\" The hound turned in the direction of the sound. He saw the fox, and growled, before he he sprinted towards him at full speed. Remember who your friends are... Cap was getting nervous. His old friend didn't take to kind to his call out. The fox attempted to escape, but it was too late! Scoot pinned Cap to the ground. The fox closed his eyes. \"You don't remember me... do you?\" The hounds breathing stabilized. He got a closer look at the fox \"Of... course I remember you.. Copper!\" He hopped off of his friend. \"Scared ya! Didn't I?!\" The fox got to his feet. \"Not cool!\" The sound of high pitched barking made the two of them turn, as two young puppies ran toward them. One of them was a light brown color. It bumped into Scoot. \"Hey!\" Scoot shouted at the . \"Tod! Knock it off!\" The fox stared at his friend. \"You just called him... Tod!?\" Scoot chuckled. \"He's my brother. Amos named him!\" Suddenly, a dark red kit jumped out of the woods, straight at Scoot. The hound growled, before the kit reconciled. \"Oh, please I'm sorry. Don't eat me mister hound! I didn't mean to...\" \"Can it Buster!\" Cap yelled. \"You're fine!\" Now, it was Scoot's turn to be confused. \"His name is... Buster?!\" Cap giggled. \"He's my brother. I named him!\" Now, Alex was approaching the four of them. \"Some things never change! Long time no see, Cap!\" Cap wanted to show Alex something. He called to Copper and Shadow. \"Follow me, guys!\" As they followed him, Alex ran with them. What did Cap want them to see? A/N: Like I said, I want to rewrite this story in a more darker tone if I have time. There's still 2 more chapters to go![Chapter 37] Epilogue A cool wind blows through the forest. A father watched as his four newborns meander around aimlessly, taking in the world, for the first time. The father watches as his son arrives, with his friends. One of them, a boy, kneels down to his level. The father nods, in acknowledgement. The eldest son brings his hound friend, to show off his new siblings. They March around the hill, unaware of the dangers of the world. The father realizes he forgot something, as he runs toward the farm. He meets up with his ok hound friend, and tells him the news. The hound called to his three kids, to follow him. As the hound scales up the rocks, toward the hill, the father fox trails behind. He realizes he's being watched, so he stops and turns toward his watcher. The old man has his eyes on the fox. His old enemy. What happens next, is a shock to the old man. The foxes mouth slowly spread to form a smirk. The old man can't help but smile back. The fox continues his path, toward his children. He arrives to meet all of those he trusts. The puppies notice the four kits, and investigate them. As they are fragile, the kits are startled, and taken aback by this curious gesture. They turn to their father, whose expression tells them not to worry. The kits were all different shades of red, one being closer to the color brown. The hound and fox watch over their children, who seem to be getting along well. Tod is the foxes name. Copper is the hound's. Their two oldest sons, Copper and Scoot are carefully patrolling the young animals, so as they don't get injured. Alex, the boy, reaches down to pet the Auburn kit, Buster. The boy is taken aback when the kit playfully snaps at him, but he simply laughs it off. Two of Copper's kids are brown with white spots, while one is fully darker brown, almost red in a way. The puppy curiously nudges the fox. \"And who might you be, little one?\" His hound friend Chuckles. \"Meet Tod!\" The fox is left startled. \"You... You named him after... Me!?\" Copper replied, \"no, Amos did.\" The puppy sat down, and looked up at Tod. \"What... are you?\" Tod laughed. \"I'm a fox kid! You're named after me!\" The puppy gasped. \"Woah! My dad and brother hunt foxes! Why isn't he hunting you?\" Copper nudged his son. \"I'm going to tell you a story... in fact, Tod should tell it.\" Tod called out to the other young animals, telling them to come to him. As the pups sat around the fox, Tod glanced over to his friend. \"Should we tell them everything? Or just our story?\" Tod's son, Copper, answered for him. \"Everything. You cover Buster's story and yours, and me and Scoot can tell ours.\" Tod nodded, as he began his tale. The tale of his past. \"Everyone has a story. This is ours.\" ~The End~ A/N: And that's the end of this story, guys! Hope you all enjoyed. If you finished, please be sure to give a review of the overall story, I'd appreciate your feedback! I'll answer any questions you have in a new Chapter. SUMMARY / RANT INCOMING This story was my idea of a true Fox and the Hound sequel, one that would be realistic to Disney's standards. I see the original movie as a lesson to younger children: friends will eventually leave your life, but you always have those memories. The original movie I feel also had some part of racism to it also. So, if the original movie was about society the year it came out, I believe that if a sequel was made, it would not have the original lesson. Friends don't really leave anymore. We are all connected in a way, be it by phone, or social media. Alex represents the new generation, who are generally more accepting than those before. He does not see a problem with the foxes, but his grandfather stuck in his old ways, does still have a problem with them.. Liam on the other hand, also has this view. Eventually, they both understand Alex, and why he is protecting Cap. RANT OVER Anyways, now I'm just trying to get into my college! You might see a remake, or a sequel, or you might not. Thanks for reading! Please review. ","Summary":" A/N: So technically, the original Fox and the Hound take place around 1967, and supposedly in the a"}]
