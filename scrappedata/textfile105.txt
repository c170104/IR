First I thought I'm dreaming. I slightly opened my one eye and I saw a faint figure through the mist. Light was shining in eyes. I opened my second eye and I couldn't realize anything. I felt dizzy and I wanted to sleep. I turned my head and I saw somehow from mist Shannon's face. I smiled to him and asked. \"What's wrong?\" My voice sounding sleepy. He didn't answer to me just kissed my lips and stroked my cheek. He was lying on his belly and kissed my arms. I still couldn't realize what he was doing. Still it was really nice and sweet. \"What time is it?\" I tried to sit up. Shannon didn't let me sit. He kisses my in lips again and I did it too. I stroked his shaved cheek and bit on the lip. He started tickling me. I hate when he does it. I'm afraid of tickles and he knows it. I curled up into a ball and started laughing. Shannon fell on top of me and started to kiss me again, everywhere. That was really appealing and romantic. I cupped his face with my hands and gently stroked it. I kissed him and looked at his brown eyes. They were browner then ever and so enticing. He started to kiss my fingertips and I giggled. I let go of his head and he started kissing my neck, shoulder and my little breast. I like when he does it. I started to laugh now that I felt awake. He stopped kissing me and I didn't like that. I wanted him to complete what he started. I just looked at him. \"I love your laugh.\" Finally he spoke to me. I smiled to him and blushed slightly. He said this to me many times but still… \"Okay. Now I have little surprise to you.\" He pressed my breast gently. That was really nice so I moaned silence. Shannon climbed off me and kissed me. About ten minutes we were just enjoying each other when he finished kissing me. I stroked his tattoo on the shoulder and gasped. '\"ou need to put on some clothes. You will freeze only with that nightgown\" I gasped again and looked at his sexy naked ass. Yeah he likes to sleep naked with me. I rolled over in bed and got up. I stretched my neck a little bit like a cat. Shan giggled and shook his ass. I bit my lower lip and took some clothes from the drawers. \"Were are we going?\" I asked him as I put my clothes on. \"You'll see.\" - he took my hand and we went to the first floor. He lifted me on his back like I was a little kid and took me to his car. Night wasn't cold and wind wasn't blowing. I like a weather like that. Shannon put me into the car and hooked the safety belt. I kissed him and then he sat at the wheel. He turned on some music and showed me a band. First that looked seductively. \"I'm going to cover your eyes.\" He whispered and blindfolded me. I didn't like that idea but if I had to… He kissed me and then started the engine. All the way he was holding my hand and stroking my fingers. That was so warm and beautiful. When he stopped Shannon didn't untie that band. He took me into his arms only this time on his shoulder. I felt like I was a doll. When we reached the place he untied the band and I saw that we were in middle of sea. We were like in small island. Shannon prepared us little picnic. That was so romantic. He helped me and we sat on the plaid. The sky was so blue and beautiful only few stars were shining. Suddenly the nightsky was lit by the fireworks with words: Happy 33 birthday Noomi! With Love Shannon. First I was a little bit scared but then I was pleased and so happy. I thought I'll cry but I just hugged him and kissed so pasionately that he couldn't breathe. Sea was calm and started to draw close to us. I wasn't afraid because I was sitting on his knees. We were eating some food, laughing and sometimes smooching. That was best birthday ever. \"And now my favourite part of your present.\" - he kissed me and put his hands on my knees I realized what he wanted from me. I bit his nose tip and he started to kiss my neck… *Few hours later.* We were sitting in a café and drinking hot wine. I was all wet and exited. We made love in our little island. And this time it was different because he pleasured me better and water gave us more adrenaline. After that he took me to the cold water and we had a shower and good time. \"Baby thanks for greatest birthday ever. I love you so much. But why I have so many love bites on my whole body?\" I asked as I took his hand. \"Because it's 33 love marks.\" he kissed me gently.

I don't know why I like this story so much, there aren't even many things happening and the movie is really short, but the dancing scenes are the best I've ever seen and Maestro, the main character is just great. I was watching it for the third time, and, strangely was still eager to watch till the end. Before playing it again, I decided to take a short trip to the kitchen, to get more snacks. As I was getting up from the couch, I saw a little shiny point moving down in the sky and went to the window to take a better look at it. It was a falling star. \"I wish I could get more of this movie, to be a part of it, to meet Maestro\" I whispered, naively believing that my wish could come true. Going back to reality, knowing that I was creating hopes that would be crashed, only to leave a deep bruise in my heart that was full of dreams that could never come true anyway, I went to the kitchen to get those snacks. Then, I arrived, disappointed in the dark living room and pressed again on play. But, suddenly, a big white circle appeared on my TV. I got closer to it, and I touched it, observing that it was harmless, or at least that was what I thought. I pushed my hand a little harder against it, and I was suddenly sucked in it. When I opened my eyes, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I was in front of an enormous mansion in front of which it was written \"Someplace Else\" just like in the movie I'd been watching all this time. And it was also the same area; everything was just like in the movie. I figured out that it was a dream and decided not to wake up, so I entered a little frightened and, at the same time, excited through the big gate and knocked three times at the giant double doors. The doors opened all by themselves just like in the movie. Inside, it was a lot scarier. The stairs were full of spider webs and the whole place looked like no one, except the ghosts had been there for a very long time. There were many rooms that I wanted to see and I was very curious about what my mind could create, but I didn't want to do this all by myself. I wanted to do it with Maestro, and I knew exactly where to find him. It was my own mind, wasn't it? I went through the way that I had memorized from the movie and arrived in front of a door with two suits of amour in front of it, which was the ball room. I entered the room silently and walked to its center. Suddenly, a cold breeze started to blow and I got a little frightened, even though I knew that he would want to scare me and that it was all a dream. I felt a cold arm on my right shoulder and turned around, seeing the curtains moving from that breeze which got stronger. I knew he was there and as my other shoulder was touched too, I felt a certain weight being pressed against both my shoulders that, at first sent shivers through my whole body. But, like I knew what was going to happen, I calmed down. I was calling Maestro's name when I was roughly turned around, and then, raised to the ceiling, being moved very fast to the back of the room. At that moment I couldn't help myself. A scream escaped my mouth at the sight of a giant skull that seemed to have its mouth open right for me to be thrown into it. But right at that time, the force that was controlling my body stopped and I was let falling while another scream was leaving my mouth. I closed my eyes and in a few seconds I landed in what seemed like someone's arms. When my eyes were opened, I was greeted with a smile by the one and only Maestro. He put me down and chuckled. \"Did I scare you?\" he asked, having that special glance of his eyes. \"I don't know. Did you scare me? I almost had a heart attack!\" I screamed and somehow made him laugh. We started walking around the room and he asked me how I had the courage to come there all by myself. I told him the beginning of all this and also specified that it was a dream, but he contradicted me saying that it was all true and I contradicted him back, not believing anymore that these things could be true. We ended up arguing, but I stopped it, not wanting to ruin this dream and told him that I wanted to see the rest of his house, but reminded that he was living there with his ghost family which I really wanted to meet, so I asked him to call them. His family looked pretty scary, but everyone was so nice that I didn't pay attention to their appearance. I asked why Maestro wasn't looking like them. He was different and he was the only one who liked to scare people in other ways, not using a zombie look. The others were actually looking normal too, but they preferred to look scary. They also told me that they were from a very rich family that lived in the 19th century which had no successors and which was brought back to life accidentally by a witch that wasn't familiarized with her powers. After that, the rest left, getting bored and wanting to do something funnier. Maestro showed me the house, which was just great. It had so many rooms that I can't even remember all of them. Their bathrooms were as big as my living room and they had a room for every single activity that someone could think of. His bedroom was full of dust and very messy. On the floor, covered by a cloth that I shouldn't touch, was a big red spot that made me realize that he was murdered and right then a very sad and frightening feeling took control of my body. I almost fainted in his arms, wanting to grab him and never let him go. I couldn't imagine how horrible it should've been. I held him tightly for about 5 minutes, and so did he. I could feel the fright those memories provoked him and I was feeling incredibly guilty. I wanted to make him feel better, so I took him out of that room and suggested to play some tricks on the people in the town. He agreed and we had a wonderful time. I never knew that playing tricks on people could be so much fun. I had laughed more than ever. They were all so great, that if someone asked me to pick my favorite, I would've said that every single one was my favorite. And, the best thing about these was that now, Maestro was happy and smiling again. We went back to Someplace Else and had fun until the sun was again up in the sky. I was starting to wonder when the end of the dream would hit me. The family, which we had played hide and seek with until then, left because none of them liked the light of the sun too much. Maestro was the only one that stayed out, where the sun rays would hit, during the day. I was tired, so we decided to take a break, to just lie somewhere and talk. I stayed with him, on the roof of the mansion and we talked for the entire day. I could never figure out how that day went by so fast. We talked about everything and anything and at the end of the day we knew all about each other. But, as no beautiful thing lasts too long I had to go back. While we were talking, his cousin came to us and said that the circle I came through was back and that in about ten minutes it will take me back, rather I want it or not. So with my heart racing, I went in the ballroom, where the circle was. I couldn't believe I had to go. At that moment, I would've given all I had, just to stay there forever. Suddenly, teardrops started to fall from my eyes. I didn't want to leave, I was more upset than ever, and Maestro saw that. He quickly came near me, pushing my body against his in a hug, and then pressing his lips slowly against mine, in a gentle loving kiss. When he finally let go, he showed me a silver heart that he broke in two, giving me a half, and keeping the other one. \"Never forget me!\" he whispered, a tear making its way down his cheek. I kissed him again and ensured him that he'll always be in my heart and that I would also find a way to come back. He told me that I could have a chance if I found a witch to help me, but it didn't seem too easy. Where am I supposed to find a witch in our dull world completely deprived of magic? I could also make another wish to a falling star, in a night with full moon, like the one I put my wish on, but that happens quite rarely. I don't think I would see one again. Finally, after I said goodbye to everyone, I left with my soul full of sadness before I would be sucked in the portal against my own will. A few minutes later, I woke up in my bed, just when my parents got back home from their short holiday. At that moment I thought that everything really was only a dream, my heart being ready to break, until I realized that I had something in my hand, the half of a silver heart. The following day, I was back to school, back to my normal boring life. Isn't it sad? In this world not only that there isn't magic, there isn't anything special or interesting anymore. Everything has already been discovered, everything has already happened. Originality and unusualness themselves became usual and very normal. I wish this world had magic, but maybe it's better like this. You don't know what people could do with it, using it in for wars and for crimes.. \" Yeah..We really don't deserve something that wonderful\" I said, making my way to the class and hoping that one day, I would be able to go back to that world, to Maestro and have the life that I've always wanted.

His head pounded and his vision was blurred. He was lost and confused. \"So, you're awake,\" A voice said. The mayor tried to focus on a figure walking towards him. He shook his head and his vision cleared. It was the Maestro. He wore a cream colored apron over his usual sophisticated attire and had his usually wild curls tied back. His face wore a strange smile, one that was enough to frighten the mayor. \"What am I doing here?\" He asked frantically. The Maestro laughed. \"There's no need to worry. We're just going to have a little...fun is all.\" The mayor's eyes widened. He remembered the Maestro's cruel tricks. He could only imagine what he would do now. \"Now, now,\" Maestro said as he noticed the mayor's fear, leaning in close. \"It's alright. You act as if I'm going to kill you.\" The mayor tried to move, but soon discovered he was tied to a table. \"And don't even think about trying to get out,\" Maestro said as he walked around him menacingly. \"You won't be able to get out of here, anyway. This whole place is locked down. You're mine now.\" \"W-what did I do?\" The mayor stammered hopelessly. \"I-I take it back. I take it a-all back. Just please d-don't do this to me.\" Maestro couldn't help but laugh at him. \"Now, I haven't even told you what I was going to do.\" \"Well whatever you're doing, it can't be good if I'm tied to a table!\" The mayor cried. Maestro turned away as if the mayor had irritated him. After pacing for only a moment, he turned back to the mayor, his hands placed on his hips. \"I thought you knew,\" He snapped. \"I can't tell you what I'm going to do. It's against the rules. You're just going to have to wait and see.\" \"R-Rules?\" Maestro nodded. \"Yes, the rules for the game, of course,\" He stated as if it were so obvious. \"What are you talking about?\" The mayor asked, genuinely confused. \"What game?\" Maestro stifled a giggle, looking down at the cold, cement floor. \"You don't know anything , do you?\" He teased, unable to control his laughter. He stepped closer to the mayor, almost completely leaning on him. \"And that's what will make this so much more fun. Have you wondered where everyone's gone?\" Maestro asked, leaning in close to the mayor's ear. The mayor's eyes widened. \"No,\" He whispered. \"Yes,\" Maestro hissed. \"Have you wondered why no one's found anything left of them? They've all,\" He made a poof gesture with his hand, \"disappeared.\" \"No.\" \"Yes!\" Maestro replied enthusiastically. \"Have you wondered why all of them have seemed to be,\" He leaned in even further, practically on top of the mayor, \" close to you?\" \"NO!\" \"YES! It's all true!\" Maestro exclaimed, now almost bouncing off the walls. \"Why do you think I've waited so long to play with you ?\" The mayor couldn't reply. He could only stare. \"Because,\" Maestro explained. \"It'll be so much fun! You get to see everyone again and it's all because of me! Who would've thought? You wouldn't believe how hard I tried to make sure you were last. I wanted this to be special. And it will be!\" The mayor couldn't believe what he was hearing. He knew Maestro was crazy, but he didn't think he could be this crazy. But it was too late now. He watched as Maestro walked to the other side of the white room to a small table. He tried to see what he picked up but he couldn't. His heart was beating so hard and fast, he was sure Maestro could hear it. And if he could, I'm sure that would only make him happier, the mayor thought. Shortly after, Maestro walked back over to where he was tied up. He was carrying a small silver box in his hands. \"Now,\" He said, opening the box. \"Which one should we use first?\" The mayor looked down at the box to see that it was full of several sharp, pointy, objects. He could figure out what they were exactly, but he assumed they were various knives, and maybe even a scalpel or two. His breathing quickened as Maestro watched him impatiently. \"Well?\" The mayor was in complete shock, trying his hardest not to scream. \"I really prefer this one,\" Maestro said as he pulled out a small scalpel. It was shiny and clean, as if it were brand new. \"Much easier to cut with. And it's so pretty. See?\" He held out the object to the mayor. It was that simple movement that sent him over the edge. He screamed at the top of his lungs, struggling to get out of the ropes that tied him to the table. Maestro watched on quietly, patiently waiting for the mayor to tire himself out. After what felt like hours, the mayor took a moment to breathe, trying to keep himself from panicking again. Maestro walked closer, scalpel in hand, a serious expression on his face. \"Now, I didn't want to do this,\" Maestro stated calmly, \"But you've left me with no choice. You broke the biggest rule of the game.\" \"W-What?\" Maestro looked down at the floor, trying to hide his smile. \"Well,\" He started, still looking at the floor, \"The rule is that the first person to get scared…\" He trailed off as he leaned in closer to the mayor. His face hung only a few inches from the mayor's as the mayor felt something pinch his abdomen. \"No. Wait-\" \" Has to die.\" Maestro eyes snapped open, hoping that he would be able to stop the events that he knew would occur. He sat up in his bed, looking around the dark room. Everything seemed so quiet. \"It was just a dream,\" He told himself. \"Only a dream.\" He lay back down, trying to even his breathing. It was times like these that he always wished he wasn't alone. Especially now, since these dreams-these nightmares -kept occurring. \"I just don't get it,\" He said out loud to no one in particular. \"Why does this keep happening?\" Shaking his head, he laid back down. Just as was about to fall back to sleep, the moonlight reflected off of something on his bedside table. Confused, he reached over to find out what the object was. Maestro tried to identify the object in the dark, but it was no use. He pulled the string to turn on the lamp on the table and gasped. The object he held in his hand was a shining, clean scalpel. So, that's my first attempt at horror. Not really horror, but just...crazy Maestro. If anyone's ever read it, this story was kind of inspired by Cupcakes. But I'm sure no one else in this fandom probably reads any MLP stuff... Anyway, hope you liked it. :D ","Summary":" The mayor woke up in a sterile white room, unaware of what brought him here.

I'm in noooooooo way saying that Maestro or Michael are gay. And whether or not that's true, we will never know. So, yeah. Enjoy. :D \"Do you really have to go?\" Norm looked back at the younger man. Maestro had been around for almost a week now. Norm had enjoyed him being there-more than anyone could ever know-and he liked- loved- the company, but he knew he couldn't delay his work any longer. \"I have to,\" He said. \"Everyone's going to think I died if I don't show up. They'll all think something happened to me after that conference and they'll definitely turn to you first.\" Maestro laughed. \"Now firstly, something did happen to you after that conference,\" He remarked as Norm shook his head. \"And secondly, that's so true. And why? They're too paranoid.\" Norm had to agree with him. Some people still hated Maestro because of their own silly suspicions. Since he had to stay in power, Norm tried to act as if he hated him. Fortunately, for both Maestro and Norm, that couldn't be any further from the truth. \"I still don't want you to go,\" Maestro whined, crawling to the edge of the bed to wrap his arms around the mayor. His long, ebony locks tickled Norm's cheek. \"You even said you hated it there,\" he continued, resting his chin on Norm's shoulder. \"Please?\" \"I said no,\" Norm said, shrugging Maestro off and turning to face him. He took Maestro's slender hands into his own. \"I know I said I don't want to,\" Norm started, \"But that doesn't change the fact that I need to.\" \"And why do you need to?\" Norm rolled his eyes. \"You don't understand. They need me-\" \"No, they don't,\" Maestro interrupted, snatching his hands away. \"They'd be just fine without you.\" \"I run this town,\" Norm said, slightly annoyed. \"Without me, where would they be?\" Maestro slumped back down on the bed as Norm walked over to his walk-in closet. Grabbing two different suits, he turned back. \"Gray or striped?\" Giving up, Maestro sighed. \"Gray. Striped makes you look like some sort of supervillian.\" \"Well, isn't that what I'm supposed to be? The evil mayor that hates everything?\" \"You know, you're right,\" Maestro joked. \"Maybe I should go back to being the creepy 'recluse' that lives on the hill, 'luring' in children with my 'mysterious magical powers.'\" They both watched each other silently before bursting into laughter. \"I still can't believe you actually said that!\" Maestro exclaimed. \"Well, you told me to say it!\" Norm said, trying to restrain laughter. \"I wasn't serious! And I didn't even think you'd mention me.\" \"Well,\" Norm started, suddenly serious. \"As mayor of this fine town, I have to address the most…'important' issues in Normal Valley. Of course it would be one of the first things I addressed.\" Maestro giggled. \"Or maybe you just wanted an excuse to say my name again.\" Norm turned to Maestro, his cheeks flushed. \"I knew it!\" Maestro exclaimed, bouncing up and down. \"I saw it! I know I did!\" \"You saw what?\" He walked over to Norm, a playful smile on his face. Norm looked slightly suspicious as Maestro disappeared behind him. \"Well,\" Maestro started, speaking softly into Norm's ear. \"I saw the way your face changed. And how you looked away when you said it.\" Placing a quick peck on Norm's cheek, Maestro walked in front of him, facing him once again. \"And?\" Maestro looked down, his grin growing wider. \"And that means a lot. And I couldn't have been the only one that saw it.\" Norm's eyes widened. \"You're right.\" \"So you probably shouldn't go, right?\" Norm paused for a moment. \"So that's what this is all about?\" He snapped. \"Partially,\" Maestro giggled. \"So does that mean you'll stay?\" \"Are you kidding?\" Norm said frantically. \"I have to save my image!\" In just ten seconds flat, he was dressed and running out the door.

That was, until the mayor of said town, Norm, decided to talk to his old enemy, the Maestro. As he started to walk towards the door of the house, Norm started to doubt himself. Maybe this wasn't a good idea, he thought. \"No,\" He said to himself. \"You *must.*\" He knocked on the door softly. Shortly after, the door swung open, but surprisingly no one was there. Norm decided to walk in anyway. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning lit up the whole house. The mayor frantically looked around, trying to figure out what was going on. He turned back to find the Maestro standing there in front of him. Startled, he jumped back slightly. \"Hi there,\" Maestro said cheerfully. \"*How* and *why* do you keep doing that?\" Norm asked. \"Doing what?\" Maestro replied. The mayor looked around, trying to find the right words. \"Oh forget it. Anyway, I need to talk to you.\" \"Okay,\" Maestro said hesitantly. \"About what?\" Norm sighed. \"I would like to apologize for any problems I've caused with you in the past few months.\" Maestro smiled. \"Okay then. Might I ask what exactly made you want to do this?\" \"I was hoping you would say that.\" Suddenly, music filled the room. The mayor turned away. \"Where did that come from?\" Maestro asked. Shortly after, Norm turned back around and began to sing. \"I saw the cover and I judged the book. I turned away without a second look. But now, now, now, I see a brand new you!\" Maestro's eyes widened. \"Oh, no.\" \"I told myself I better run and hide,\" The mayor continued. \"I never noticed what was there inside. But now, now, now I see a brand new you!\" \"Well, this has been great, but maybe you should-\" \"And I can't stop myself from loving every itty bitty thing you do!\" \"What?\" Before Maestro could protest any further, the door opened behind him and what was most likely the entire population of Normal Valley entered the room. They all seemed to be singing back-up for the mayor in this little musical number he was performing. Norm continued to sing. \"I didn't know where I was meant to be. I figured no one would be there for me. But now, now, now I see a brand new you!\" \"You, you, I see a brand new you!\" The townspeople sang. Maestro thought about the situation and decided, 'If you can't beat them, join them… IN SONG.' \"I never knew that you could understand,\" They both sang. \"But I looked up and you reached out your hand. And now, now, now, I see a brand new you!\" For the next two minutes and thirty-seven seconds, Maestro, the mayor, and the people of Normal Valley sang and danced like they were in a Broadway musical. After the song ended, the mayor looked over at Maestro. \"Now do you understand?\" He asked. Maestro paused for a minute. \"Not really, no.\" The mayor sighed. \"Well then. Okay everyone. ONE MORE TIME!\" \"No!\"[Chapter 2] \"Hello!\" Norm said in a singsong-y voice as he entered through the doors of Someplace Else. He was there to once again talk to his somewhat new friend, Maestro. \"Hey, get out here! I have something I need to tell you!\" After a moment of silence, Maestro appeared from a door at the top of the stairs. \"What is it now?\" He muttered to himself as he made his way down the stairs. \"I just wanted to tell you that,\" the mayor said, pausing to wipe an imaginary tear from his face, \"I will be leaving tomorrow.\" \"You're leaving?\" Maestro asked, raising an eyebrow in confusion. \"Yes,\" The mayor replied. \"I've found that politics just doesn't interest me anymore. I'm moving on to bigger and better things.\" \"Oh really?\" Maestro said suspiciously. He waited a few moments while the mayor stood in silence. \"Are you going to tell me what-\" \"I'M GOING TO BE ON BROADWAY!\" The mayor shouted excitedly. Maestro jumped back, startled by the mayor's outburst. \"Broadway? B-but how?\" \"Apparently, my talent has been discovered!\" \"How so?\" \"Well,\" Norm looked down. \"I know people and they know people and… I showed him what I did.\" \"What you did?\" Maestro asked. \"You mean here?\" \"Exactly.\" \"How did you,\" Maestro said, \"-Wait a minute! Are you saying that you-\" \"Oh, Maestro,\" the mayor interrupted, placing an arm around his shoulders, \"We've known each other for quite some time, haven't we?\" \"Please don't touch me,\" Maestro said, struggling to break free of Norm's grasp. He ignored him and went on. \"Well, I just thought that since you're the one that led me to this, you should be the first to know. But if I'm not wanted here…\" He trailed off. \"Fine,\" Maestro snapped, crossing his arms. \"Good,\" The mayor said cheerily, releasing Maestro. \"Now, I had something I needed to tell you.\" Suddenly, light music filled the room. \"Oh no, not again!\" Maestro complained. \"Why does this keep happening? I never-\" \"I've heard it said,\" Norm sang as Maestro continued ranting, \"that people come into our lives for a reason, bringing something we must learn. And we are led to those who help us most to grow if we let them and we help them in return.\" \"…You just couldn't save it for Broadway,\" Maestro went on. \"Well I don't know if I believe that's true. But I know I'm who I am today because I knew you.\" \"What happened to you hating me?\" \"Like a comet pulled from orbit,\" Norm continued, rushing to Maestro's side, pointing at an imaginary comet, \"As it passes a sun. Like a stream that meets a boulder halfway through the wood.\" Maestro backed away slowly as the mayor went on. He couldn't help but wonder if maybe Norm would stop if he were to smash himself into the floor again. \"Who can say if I've been changed for the better?\" Norm reached for Maestro's hand as he stared off into the distance for a brief moment. \"But, because I knew you, I have been changed for good.\" He looked at Maestro. \"No,\" he said. \"Not this time. You can't- it well may be,\" Maestro sang, \"That we will never meet again in this lifetime. So, let me say before we part; so much of me is made from what I've learned from you. You'll be with me like a handprint on my heart.\" As he went on, Maestro kept asking himself why this kept happening. Why did the mayor always have the power to make him sing show tunes? By the end of the second chorus, he just decided to let it go on. It'll be the last time I see him, and the last time I hear another show tune. And so, the two went on to sing together in perfect harmony for another two minutes or so. During that time, it felt like all had been forgiven. Everything made sense again and unicorns ran through the skies with glee. All of this and more was achieved through the power of music and friendship. \"…For good .\" And so, the story ends. For now. :3 I don't know, I probably won't put all of you through another one of these, so you my friends, are lucky. Oh and I certainly don't own the song. Or Wicked. Or Ghosts. Yet.

This is... well, you know what this is. It's the prototype of a Mary Sue made specifically for the Ghosts 1997 fandom on . Keep in mind the following character may be a Sue, but that doesn't mean somebody else's character who has one or two of the same qualities is one too. Maestro: We're going to hell for this, aren't we? Me: Probably. Maestro: *facepalm* O*O*O[Chapter 2] A/N: Well, lads, I thought you'd be smart enough to be able to tell this is a parody. After all, it is listed as one. Brooke Diana Naomi Lisa Marie Campbell-Shields (Take note, these are all females MJ had any sort of relationship with, even as just friends.) has just moved in to the town of Normal Valley with her niece, Sarah, (It's more common with nephews, actually.) who's parents are dead, in rehab, and otherwise unavailable, since the circumstances are always changing. She is 23 years old, with caramel skin, chocolate colored curls, and cherry red eyes. (So she's a walking dessert. OM NOM NOM.) She works for the mayor, who doesn't keep it a secret that he wants to get in her pants. (Maestro: Um, ew?) One day, Sarah goes missing, and Brooke has to use her speshul snowflake powers to figure out where she is, which turns out to be Someplace Else. Thus, it is revealed that Sarah had no point in the story whatsoever other than to lead the Sue to Maestro, who seems friendly, but Brooke is still suspicious. Well, for a couple of days. The two hit it off, and while they don't immediately fall in love, it doesn't take long before they bonk each other's brains out. (On a bed this time, thankfully.) Shortly afterward, the mayor tries to rape- I mean seduce Brooke, but she refuses, causing him to retaliate by storming the mansion with an angry mob. Because not only is the bitch worth it, but he also knew she was screwing Maestro. However, the plan backfires, as Maestro proves he has a backbone (Jealousy: *snorts in disbelief* He broke quite easily for me.) and tries to scare them away. The story ends with Brooke doing nothing to help Maestro at all, yet still getting to marry him or some other rubbish like that. Maestro: *nods* Marriage is for pansies. Nobody in my family ever (technically) got married, and look at us now! :D Will: We're full of screwups. There was that deformed guy who ate people, I killed my own twin, Maestri killed her brother, Hazel spent her entire human life sick, Eric is terrifying, your parents met at a bar then screwed in a barn on the same night, resulting in you, and you're- Maestro: *clamps hand over mouth* Okay, I think we're done here. Will: *annoyed face* Anywho, this is what I like to call a \"civilized Sue\". It acts like it isn't a MS, but because the plot is so full of holes it looks like Swiss cheese it ultimately becomes one. That, and I get pissed every time Maestro- and MJ in general- feels attracted to a girl at all purely because she's OMG SO HAWT. When am I gonna find a story with a plain/average looking female gets thd guy, or an attractive female becomes FRIENDS with the male lead? (Wait, I wrote one of those... But it was only because she was already dead. SON OF A-) Because all MJ Fanfiction is about is self-insert sex fantasies with no soul. There is nothing to be learned from reading them, and you certainly won't walk away thinking \"Wow, that was a beautiful story.\" The only exception I've ever read was the reason why I started writing about Maestro, and you scared her off through plagiarism.

She has neon purple hair and violet eyes. (Elizabeth Taylor must be spinning like a top in her grave...) Her skin is blue (Smurf! SMURRRFF!) and she is very skinny. As in, Barbie doll skinny. With the same physics as Jessica Rabbit. The queen from Captain EO is her mother, and they hate each other because everyone loves Stephanie and her own mother is jealous. (REEEEEAAAALLLLLYYYYYYY?) So her mother keeps her locked away in the dungeons being tortured. (How do people love her then? o_O) One day, Stephanie hears about some visitors to the planet, and uses her extreme hawtness to get the jailer to let her go up and see. (Why she wouldn't use this to escape, no one knows.) There she meets Captain EO and his ragtag gang of Muppets. EO saves the day while she watches and does nothing, and afterwards he offers to take her with him. Because he secretly wants to make whoopie with her. Yep. Insert Captain Kirk joke here.

And go in peace.\" At the sign of therncross Andrew made towards her body, the last words of his prayerrncaused Frankie's body stiffened then fall limp on the bed as thernflames disappeared around them. It took Andrew only a second to rushrnto her side; he quickly glanced over her body amazed that the onlyrnsign left of her stigmata was the blood that stained the white sheetsrnbeneath her. \"Frankie…\" He whispered as he brushed a strayrnpiece of hair from her face, his other hand automatically moving tornher wrist to check for a pulse. \"Frankie…wake up love,\" hernwhispered softly to her. Cardinal Houseman shookrnhis head attempting to regain his composer after the episode he hadrnjust experienced, climbing slowly to his feet he rested against thernwall for a moment as he watched Andrew with Frankie.

It'srnreally Father Kiernan I adore more than the movie itself, so I justrnwanted to write a little angsty one shot about his feelings andrnthoughts on Frankie and his life in general. Hope yournStigmata/Kiernan fans enjoy it, and if you have any feedback I'drnlove to hear it. Thank you! A WeakrnMan Arn'Stigmata' Fanfic This may come as arngreat surprise to you, but Father Andrew Kiernan had not been born arnpriest. He had not been bornrninto some pious listless life; maturing in a drab cloister thatrnshunned worldly desires and turned a bind eye to temptation; only torngrow up to be a being of clipped desires and virtuous needs. No, Andrew Kiernan wasrnstill an ordinary man, and beneath that righteous and collectedrnmanner, a weak one at that. He'd lived a typicalrnboyhood full of boyish pursuits, achievements, disappointments, andrnfantasies. And when he was no longer a boy, he found himself a man;rna man who experienced life as a man should. He'd loved, lost…andrnin the end he was hurt. When the experience ofrnliving as a man had lost its joy, he decided to become somethingrnbeyond a man; he became a priest. After all, it was thernmost sanctimonious way to close himself off from a world that hadrnleft him heartbroken so early on. That wasn't to say he wasn'trnreligious to begin with. He'd grown up Irish Catholic; he lovedrnthe Lord with all of his being. He knew that Jesus himself couldrnunderstand the pain of being human far more than he could. Jesusrnunderstood heartache; Jesus understood the cold and pitiless crueltyrnof the world. He truly felt that Jesus was the only being who couldrnfully understand him. In the light of that realization, perusing arncareer in organic chemistry seemed more than a little trite. Thernother reason for him becoming a priest, and the one he was more aptrnto tell those who often asked, were those \"holes\" in the theoriesrnof universal explanation. There were bigger mysteries out there tornsolve; bigger powers to serve……and he felt called to give himselfrnover to those powers. And so Andrew Kiernanrnfell to his knees, and not this time for superficial human love…..butrnfor God. He had traded one set of complications for another; thernuniform of a scientist for the uniform of a priest. And he indeedrnfound it easier to hide behind the starched white collar of faithrnthan he ever had behind the exposed throat of a modest man. He was always arnscientist before he was a priest, and maybe that was his problem.rnBut he soon found his niche within the Church and his superiors lovedrnhis skeptical eye. He was delegated to work within \"ThernCongregation for the Causes of the Saint\"; one of the Vatican'srnmany, many sub departments. His mission was to scientificallyrndisprove every wild theory thrown the way of Catholic Church; be it arnbleeding statue, photographic silhouettes of Jesus Christ in a rollrnof vacation photos, sightings of Saints at the local drugstore, orrnthe Virgin Mary's image in somebody's jello mold. Any and allrnmanner of 'miracles' were his to debunk; a task he performed withrnthe utmost efficiency. He admitted to gaining some sense of brutalrnpleasure in refuting religious zealots and ungrounded dreamers in thernface of hard science. Still, he held a firm belief that somewherernout there, there did exist a true miracle; something that would bernbeyond his means of clinical explanation and deepen his faith to arnlevel he'd always desired it to be. He devoted himself to findingrnthat miracle. The Church itself wasrnanother problem, and Andrew found himself disenchanted with it fromrnthe start; a feeling that only grew stronger with time. The Churchrnwas a business just like any other business, full of beuocraticrnscheming and politics. Andrew's investigative department in thernVatican was under the jurisdiction of one Cardinal Daniel Houseman.rnAndrew disliked Houseman from the start, but there was little to berndone about that….and besides doesn't the Lord wish us to notrnfoster hatred for others? There was so muchrncorruption. The Church had more power than most people evenrnrealized; what they wanted to get out, got out, what theyrndidn't…stayed safely locked away. There were secrets out there,rnsecrets that the Church did not want to be brought to light. Andrewrnfound himself brazenly seeking to discover those secrets and exposernthem to the rest of the world. Was he working against the Church?rnNo, but it couldn't be said he didn't have his own hidden agendarnthroughout it all. Houseman could send him all over the world, andrnstill Andrew often felt that the real mystery worth defrauding wasrnright there in Rome. Then, out of the middlernof nowhere, Frankie Paige had come into his life, and what Andrewrnbelieved to be up was down, and what he thought was black was in factrnwhite……what he thought was wrong, was in fact very, very right.rnShe was right. She was also receiving the stigmata, and althoughrnhe'd been typically skeptical at first it didn't take long forrnhim to realize that even he could not contest what he was seeingrnhappen to her with his very own eyes. He was forced to set aside hisrnuncertainty for faith and accept the ludicrous reality that thisrnyoung woman from Pennsylvania was receiving the stigmata. Ah, Frankie Paige….. She had been a perfectrnexample of the rampant twenty something selfishness andrndisillusionment that seemed to be choking the life out of those who'drnbarely begun to live. Here she was, a self proclaimed atheistrnreceiving the stigmata; something that the most devout of Catholicsrnconsidered to be a gift from Christ himself. It was unheard of, butrnit was undeniable. Why, of all people, had Frankie received thernstigmata? And why of all people did Andrew find himself dangerouslyrndrawn to her? Was it because she was simply 'the forbidden fruit'?rn Or was it something more? Sure, he'd found her attractive rightrnaway…but Andrew had gotten quite used to the daily temptations ofrnwomen; it was a feeling he had learned to suppress long ago. Therernwas more about her than just a pretty face though…and as sherncontinued to receive the stigmata, so did he continue to find himselfrnhaving stronger feelings for her. She'd changed along the way;rngrowing in a spiritual depth that certainly she and even he hadn'trnknown existed. She was so beautiful, even in those moments of agony.rn She both engaged and infuriated him. When she'd tried tornseduce him that day up in her apartment, he'd found it nearlyrnbeyond his power to push her away. Yet, he realized that he stillrnpossessed enough inner strength to not allow himself to fall prey tornthat temptation; no matter how much he wanted to. He'd told herrnthat this sort of temptation was something he struggled with; andrnshe'd exploited it shortly thereafter; perhaps both due to her ownrndesires and the evil possession that had been forced into her. He'drnprayed about it later, about her, about himself. He asked God forrncontinued strength and guidance. But he already knew then that hernwas in love with her, and in that matter God could not help him. Frankie's inflictionrnwith the stigmata had led to the discovery of the lost Gospel's ofrnSaint Thomas; the miracle Andrew had been unknowingly waiting for allrnthese years. These scriptures were said to be the words of JesusrnChrist himself, and their message proved to be a serious threat tornthe very foundations of the Church. Frankie herself, possessed byrnFather Alameda, had uttered their passages: \"The Kingdom ofrnGod is within you and all around you. Not in mansions of wood andrnstone. Split a piece of wood and I am there. Lift a stone and yournwill find me.\" The Church claimedrnthese scriptures heresy, a claim that was understandable given thernChurch's immense power and influence. Such thoughts as: \"Onerndoes not need the Church to find God; God is in you….in all that isrnaround you. All you need is faith,\" could ruin the Church beyondrnrepair. They were absolutely petrified of the consequences of thisrnknowledge becoming public. Andrew had gone back tornBrazil, at last, and unearthed the scriptures exactly where he knewrnthey'd be. Upon finding out about his discovery, The Church wantedrnnothing to do with him anymore. Even with Cardinal Houseman'srnexposure in the cover up, the mighty Catholic Church was not sorneasily defeated, a reality that Andrew knew well enough. Asrnexpected, his priesthood was revoked and he was asked to permanentlyrnleave his position at the Vatican. He was reasonably upset, but notrnwithout some relief. For discovering the lost Gospel's of Thomasrnwere more than worth the loss of his priestly status. That was thernmiracle he had been waiting for……..that and Frankie. Having had the spiritsrnwithin her exorcised and her wounds healing nicely, Frankie Paige wasrnfree to live the life she'd had before; a jaded life of partying,rnshopping and being generally self gratifying. But she'd changed;rnreceiving the stigmata had altered her drastically. Andrew hadrnkeenly watched this change in her; from its frustrating beginnings tornits angelic blooming. She was like a child taking her firstrnfaltering steps into a new realm of spirituality; wide eyed and inrnawe of the glory around and inside of her. She was still unsure ofrnherself, but he could see the growing confidence in her every day andrnit was truly a beautiful thing to behold. Yes, of course he hadrnchosen to return to her. It's what a weak man would do after all. Lying next to Frankiernnow, he measured his breathing against her own; it was a lulling,rndeep, contented tempo. But it was raining outside, and the tattoornsound of rain drops on the nearby window kept him awake despite hisrnheavy fatigue. Frankie's slim hands, still visibly scarred andrninnocently folded together, lay propped up under her blonde mass ofrnhair; her head in turn resting on his bare shoulder. Andrew brushedrnaway a few stray strands of hair from her forehead; noting the fadingrnscars still etched into her skin where the wounds of the crown ofrnthorns had injured her not so long ago. From there his gaze followedrnthe graceful line of neck, to her exposed breasts and on down to thernsubtle curve of her hips. He was tempted to reach out to her, tornkiss her….but with well practiced swiftness he checked that desirernbefore he could act on it. It was best to let her sleep. He was suddenly veryrnaware that God knew his every thought, and saw his every action.rnLingering on this, Andrew was instantly filled with a sudden sense ofrnoverwhelming shame. He slowly pulled himself away from Frankie; beingrncareful not to disturb her weighty sleep as he did so. Crawling over the edgernof the bed and onto the floor, he settled himself on his knees;rnrelishing in typical masochistic Catholic fashion at the discomfortrnthe hardwood floor caused his bare kneecaps. He was very aware ofrnhow vulnerable and exposed he was, fully naked to the world…..bothrnphysically and spiritually. But in this at least he had no shame;rnafter all, God had seen him in far more compromising positions. Crossing himself, hernbowed his head and raised his clasped hands to his forehead. In this prone state hernasked God for forgiveness, for what he'd just done and for what hernwas likely to do again. He was a sinner; a weak man, God help him.rnFor all his successes, he'd managed to fail in so many other ways.rnThere was no going back now. To his surprise he feltrntears stringing his eyes. He couldn't recall the last time he'drnwept. He felt both simultaneously ridiculous and relieved at thernrush of emotion. But he managed to hold back anything further andrninstead fell into deeper prayer. After sometime he wasn't evenrnsure what he was praying about…or if he was even praying at all. \"Andrew?\"rnFrankie's voice from behind him, weak and sleepy, broke into hisrnprayers. He wasn't even exactly sure how long he'd been kneelingrnthere, but it felt like days. He continued to keeprnhis head bowed and back turned despite Frankie's question; slowlyrndrawing himself back to the surface of reality. He heard her shift; thernsound of the sheets brushing against her body as she moved closer tornhim. \"Hey…..Andrew?\" He then felt her warmrnhand on his shoulder, and he affectionately pinned it down with onernof his own; still facing away from her. Her voice becamernstronger. \"What's wrong? Are you okay?\" Finally turning towardsrnher, he made no effort to hide the passion he'd felt, but wasrnunable to look her in the face. Instead he placed an unsteady handrnon her shoulder. Frankie's concernrngrew. \"Andrew? Oh Jesus-ah-\"she quickly snapped a hand over herrnmouth; an apologetic expression momentarily creasing her features,rn\"I'm sorry…..hey, come here.\" Pushing forward she wrappedrnher arms around his shoulders and drew him towards her into anrnembrace. She settled her chin on his shoulder; speaking softly intornhis ear. \"What's wrong Andrew? Talk to me.\" He wanted to tell her,rnhe wanted to tell her everything; about his life before he'd been arnpriest, his pain and sacrifice over the years and the shame andrnconflict that he still felt. But she wasn't ready for all of that,rnshe wouldn't fully understand…..not yet. Someday she would bernthough, and when she was ready…he would tell her. \"I was asking forrnforgiveness….\" He responded quietly. Pulling away, he finallyrnlooked her fully in the face; dark brows knitting over his blue eyesrnas he struggled to regain his composure. He sensed a question onrnher lips, but then she seemed to come to an understanding, and keptrnsilent; for that he was glad. Instead she offered him a small smilernand nod of acceptance that went beyond her years. He knew shernwouldn't have been capable of that simple understanding just merernmonths ago. She had matured so much in such a short span of time.rnHe was so proud of her; for what she'd gone through…for whatrnshe'd endured. She leaned forward; herrnhands tenderly holding either side of his face as she searched hisrneyes with her newfound depth and understanding. Looking at her nowrnAndrew no longer felt the ominous restraints of sin holding him back;rnsomething had released him. He was indeed still just a man, andrnyes…..a weak one at that. He'd tried, and to some extent he hadrnfailed miserably. But there was some odd relief in recognizing andrnaccepting that failure. After all, what more could he be but a merernman? Pulling his attentionrnback to Frankie, he finally returned her soft smile; and an unspokenrnmessage completed its exchange between them. No, he was wrong…hernhad not failed…at least not as a man. He had Frankie; a woman whornloved him…despite his failures, or maybe even because of them. Andrnthat was something he could be proud of. So it was with renewedrnfaith that he leaned forward and met her lips with his own.

He continued to walk the stairs,nthinking of a song he remembered. He stopped about three steps away fromnthe door. \"It's okay Alan, momma would be thrilled to see you.\" he toldnhimself as he stared at the door. With hesitation he placed his fist on thendoor, and pulled it back, until the door and his hand met. He stood back,nwaiting for the answer. A pale woman opened the door. Her hair was naturally blonde, and she hadnan hour glass figure. Her brown eyes glistened as she stared at Alan. \"MaynI help you?\" she managed to say. Alan looked familiar to her, almost as ifnshe had met him before. \"Mrs. Sarah James?\" Alan asked. \"Yes, that's me, isnthere something wrong?\" Alan laughed, and Sarah knew it was forced. \"Well,nI don't really know how to say this. There is nothing wrong, if you'renafraid of that.\" Alan closed his mouth, he knew he was making himself seemnto obviously nervous. \"Why don't come back another day, after you've gottennyourself collected,\" said the now, curious Sarah. \"No! I mean...no...Inthink I can say this now,\" said Alan. \"Mrs. James, I'm your son.\" With angasped Sarah slammed the door. Alan with a sigh turned around and walkedndown the wooden steps. The city streets were foreign to Alan. He, being from Kentucky, alwaysnimagined the city to be a magical place, full of lights, clubs, and women.nHe didn't expect to go outside, and see bums walking the streets. \"Hey, Heynyou!\" called a man walking toward him. \"The end is near! You must confess,nthe end is near!\" the man called. Alan froze, he saw a strange man runningntoward him. \"You stay away now,\" said Alan with his thick Southern accent.n\"I want no trouble.\" \"The end is near my boy, God will descend from thenheavens and kill all those who have failed him\" Alan stared at the man.n\"What would an old bum know about the lord?\" Alan shouted. The man stoppednrunning and smiled \"In the lords eyes you have been blessed. Do not benfooled by my looks, I know more than you think.\" Alan smiled wickedly.n\"Good show old man, here's a quarter, now leave me be\" Alan said whilentossing the coin. \"Keep your money, besides, it will be no use for where wenare going.\"n Alan walked away, not letting the man bother him. \"What a foolishnslacker, its people like that who pollute our streets\" Suddenly a greatnblinding light had flashed. Alan could see nothing but the light untilnsteps appeared from the sky. A gorgeous woman walked down each step,nslowly, carefully, and smiling. She stopped in front of Alan. \"May youncarry the burden Of Christ\" she said, and she slowly leaned forward, andnkissed Alan on his forehead. \"For you have been chosen. You should notnconsider the poor foolish, for the wealthy are not always the wise.\" Alannlet out one single sob while the woman turned back, and climbed the stairs. There he was, back on the streets of New York. His hand was held tightlyninto a single fist, while a dollar bill had been wedged in the middle by anpasser. Alan stood up, and dusted himself off. \"The summer heat has turnednme into a lunatic\" he assured himself. \"I need some rest.\" He walked towardnthe hotel he was staying in. As he opened the door he saw a strange writingnon his wall. He stared, wide-eyed, and confused. He ran to the front desknand told the manager about the graffiti on his walls. \"If you don't mind, Inwould like to see this writing\" said the short, pear shaped man. \"Ofncourse! I would like to see it removed as soon as possible!\" shouted Alan.n\"But of course,\" said the manager. After the elevator doors opened to thenfloors he was staying in, Alan opened the door of his room. \"Sir, I have a very busy schedule, and I would prefer not to be bothered bynsuch nonsense ever again!\" shouted the manager. \"I assure you the writingncovered my walls! It was in some sort of odd language. Hebrew maybe,\"nreplied the shocked Alan. \"I highly doubt that Hebrew is considered to benodd. And you and I both have witnessed no such writing on these walls.\"nAlan looked in his room. The walls were the pale pink they have been whennhe first signed into the hotel. \"I don't know what to say\" Alan said withnhis head still fixed on the walls\" \"Say nothing, it has been forgotten.nNow, would you like anything else sir?\" replied the man. \"No, thank you,nthat is all for now\" Alan said, while slowly walking into the room.

The courtyard was alive with the vivacious songs of sparrows finches, and the other birds that lined the branches of the large tree that was suspended above them. St. Matthew seemed to be smiling to the birds, the kind, stone ridges in his face deepened, but he showed no sympathy to the couple on the bench. He was not facing them, his back turned towards the church. While the churchyard remained vital, Frankie was anemic in his arms. Slim, long fingers (made for playing the piano, not scientific experiments) stroked a few blonde strands of hair from her forehead. The skin he touched was covered in scars and raised abrasions. It did nothing to lift her sleepy eyelids. Andrew wrapped her more tightly in the white bed sheet that had been stained red by her wounds reopening against the thick gauze that protected them. It had been long time since he had cried, despite the fact of his usual rough apathy, liquid filled his eyes and brimmed over the edge forcing its self out. She didn't deserve this. She was a messenger, not a firm believer. Even though the rosary that was drapped around her fingers was in her posession now, it had once belonged to the south american priest. Andrew pondered this. So, why her? She didn't even believe in God. Frankie stirred silently, moving her arms slightly, and her mouth twitched a bit. She was going to live, wasn't she? Still, her eyes remained closed shut. Now he could see past the green platformed sandals, the risque tops, the too-short-to-be skirts, and the plastic necklaces. Andrew could see the placidness in her, the fire had brought out a childish flush to her cheeks. He could understand the child within her, the bouncy-curl haired child with her white communion dress on. What ever had happened to her? What had happened to the faith? Frankie was a true example of maiden virginity at this moment. Her hair made her look vunerable because it was layered into her eyes, and her blue pajamas made her look like a little girl in her father's oversized pajamas. Thin and scrawny beneath the flimsy fabric. Andrew pulled out the laminated picture of the Virgin Mary from the breast pocket of his black shirt. She looked as immaculate as Frankie, a faint glow illuminating her from the hidden sun. The words rolled from his tongue in a faint whisper, \"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.\" The prayer wouldn't have helped, in his eyes anyway. How could something that felt so dead in his arms be brought back by a simple saying. He had a new perspective. This was that prayers need not be spoken. He wasn't even sure if there was a God anymore. He threw the picture into the grass (which needed cutting). Frankie was out cold. Her mind was alive with visions and she believed she was being crucified. She felt the nails in her wrists, she felt the wood against her back making splinters into her bare flesh, she felt the thorns digging into her skin. Dreams had never been so vivid for Frankie before she started getting her injuries. Andrew thought of his days in Ireland, then. His mind temporarily drifted from Frankie. He was trying to find some explination as to why he became a priest, now that he lacked all faith possible to be one. His home had been in Adare, an Irish village where some of the houses still bore roofs made of hay and other earthly materials. The religious influence where he had lived had been strong, forcing him into the church made of stone every Sunday and making him quit seeking the taverns every Friday nights. He drank less and less once he had become a priest, but Frankie had reawakened the drinker in him. He sighed. Two things he had come to love in a respectful way were now so far from him. Frankie and Ireland. With a flutter of eyelashes as soft as a butterfly's wing touch to human skin, blue eyes reopened to the tranquil courtyard. She barely spoke the words, \"Lift a rock and you will find me. Split a piece of wood and I am there,\" before her eyes fell close again and the wave of death took her away from him. She was gone now. Andrew put her aside on the bench and lifted a gray stone up from its place on the ground, but Frankie did not awake. She never awoke. Andrew lost all faith then. God was cruel in mysterious ways. He cried out, \"God, why have you forsaken me?\" Three hours later, Father Andrew Kearnen was rushed to an emergency room in Phittsburgh. A priest at his bedside asked him what confessions he wished to make before his spirit become amongst the clouds. \"I have lost my faith, Father. There are no more things for a blind man to see if he cannot see the sky. There are no more things for a thief to steal if he has stole everything. There are no more prayers I can pray to console myself. Forgive me, Father for I have sinned.\" And with those words, Andrew lapsed into an unexplained coma. Just as he fell into his coma, his side began to bleed. Wounds that hadn't been there before. Andrew never woke up.

Chapter 3 \"Man this road is dark!\" \"Feels so strange walking like this!\" \"How much longer until we get to this place, my hair is starting to blow out,\" Brianna replied \"Oh be quiet, your hair is not even that real!\" Ron blurted when Brianna turned around \"You better take that back!\" Brianna yelled as she aimed at Ron with her fist \"Guys please stop it, your embarrassing yourselves!\" Liza replied as she held Brianna back \"They always fight,\" Brandon said \"You two will be walking back home by yourselves with a letter to your parents if you don't settle down now!\" The mayor halted and looked back \"But-\" \"No \"buts\" Miss Daniels,\" The Mayor replied \" You always got to get me in trouble!\" Brianna growled at Ron \"Miss Daniels!\" The Mayor yelled which alarmed Briana \"Alright, I'll stop,\" Brianna mumbled as she folded her arms \"Now lets go and not another word from the two of you!\" The Mayor said as he turned around and continued walking The rest of the crew followed on without hesitation as the Mayor halted in front of them. \"Alright everyone, get yourselves together because this is going to be a tough ride,\" He replied as he gestured towards the large, steep hill. \"Oh no, not me!\" Brianna said \"Whoa, that hill is the size of Mt. Everest!\" Brandon replied. The hill looked to be around 200 feet tall and had no turns. \"Amazing!\" Liza said \"How do I expect to walk up this hill and still maintain a good manicure and pedicure until tomorrow?\" Brianna asked \"Oh Brianna,\" Kiki replied \"Why don't you worry about that when we get up the hill Miss Daniels?\" The Mayor asked \"Just got dissed by the Mayor,\" Ron responded \"Who just got dissed?\" Brianna replied as she stared at Ron from the corner of her eye \"Nobody,\" Ron replied \"Okay kids, we have to do this smart and fast since we have until midnight to get back,\" The Mayor said \"That hill is killer!\" Steve replied \"How am I supposed to get up there without falling on my back?\" Brianna asked \"You will survive Brianna,\" Liza replied \"Okay lets go!\" The Mayor ordered as he took the first step up the hill * 30 minutes later* \"…I…hate…this…\" \"Come on Brianna you are falling behind!\" \"I…am….trying….my….best…\" Brianna wheezed as she reached the top of the hill and placed her hands on her knees. \"You really need to exercise more,\" \"What was…that …Brandon?\" Brianna growled \"Nothing your majesty,\" Brandon replied as he and Steve snickered \"I…am…never…doing…this…again!\" Brianna gasped \"Somebody needs to stop feeding on those donuts,\" Ron replied \"I…hate…hills…\" Brianna breathed, \"too…much…climbing,\" \"Come on Brianna, you should be used to hills by now since we climbed them all the time during Girl Scouts,\" Kiki said when she walked over to help her \"….I did…not…climb…hills….like…these. Those…hills…were only…two….feet…tall,\" Brianna exhaled \"Here let me help you,\" Kiki said as she grabbed Brianna by the arm and pulled her up to stand straight. \"….thanks…I…needed…that…\" Brianna replied \"No problem, now come on before the Mayor leaves us,\" Kiki said \"Finally… took you long enough!\" Brandon replied as Brianna limped toward the rest of the group \"Okay now lets continue,\" The Mayor replied when the group followed and they ended up walking down a grey stony pathway \"Wow this place is gloomy,\" Steve replied as he shined his flashlight from his Blackberry around. Suddenly the Mayor stopped in his tracks again when he noticed something strange. \"What is now?\" Brandon mumbled annoyed \"It's a sign,\" Steve said \"Where?' Brianna asked \"There at the gate,\" Steve pointed as everybody looked \"Oh the gate!\" They said as they eyed the large iron gate that seemed a hundred years old \"Whoa!\" Brandon said when he looked at the gate covered in dust and webs \"This gate looks like it hasn't been cleaned in over a hundred years!\" Brianna replied \"Maybe because it is a hundred years old!\" Ron said \"Who asked you!\" Brianna snapped \"Nobody did!\" Ron yelled back when suddenly a flash of lightning and roll of thunder stopped them \"What does the sign say…Someplace Else?\" The mayor replied as he wiped off the webbed sign \"What?\" \"The place is called \"Someplace Else\",\" \"How convenient, a place called Someplace Else when it feels like we are at Nowhere Else!\" Brianna said \"Maybe you should go 'Someplace Else' like back home!\" Ron replied \"Listen I am tired of your nonsense, you have been at me all day with your ridiculous-\" Brianna yelled when she got cut off by a flash of lightning. Then out of nowhere the gate began to creak when it slowly opened by itself. \"Uh oh…\" Brandon said \"T-that's not a good sign,\" said a random black guy who tagged along \"How do gates just open like that?\" Brianna asked \"Cool\" Steve said Once the gate opened there was a mist of smoke all around. \"Oh…mysterious,\" Brandon said in a dramatic voice \"What is this place anyways?\" Brianna asked \"Someplace Else like the sign said,\" Liz said \"It looks so spooky,\" Brianna replied \"Yea I heard a monster lives here,\" Brandon said \"Maybe it's a wild animal,\" \"I heard its one of those creepy people that like to kidnap kids in the middle of the night,\" Ron replied \"Maybe it's a ghost,\" Brandon said \"Yea and then the boogey man comes out the corner,\" Brianna mocked \"Who-Who!\" \"AAHH!\" \"Calm down its just an owl,\" Ron said when he turned to his left and saw the owl at the top of the tree \"I'm getting out of here!\" Brianna replied as she tried to run when Kiki held her \"Oh no, If I am staying then you are staying. We made a deal!\" Kiki said \"But this place is freaky!\" Brianna replied \"Calm down, its just an owl and the gate opening by itself doesn't mean anything. Its probably one of those technologically advanced gates that operate on their own because they have electromagnetic wires attached to them,\" Kiki said \"Wow…I never understand what you are saying sometimes,\" Brianna said blinking \"Anyways I am saying that its going to be okay and there are NO ghosts or Boogeyman here,\" Kiki replied when thunder began to rumble. \"I don't like the sound of that,\" Brianna whined \"Hey girls, are you going to stand there or are we going to get to where we are going?\" The mayor asked \"Um sorry Mayor we were just-\" \"Save it, we are running late,\" The mayor said, \"We have a unwanted neighbor to visit,\" To be Continued...[Chapter 4] Authors Note: Hello.

Chapter 4 \"This place is too creepy,\" Brianna replied looking around as the fog made it look even more so. \"OOOowwwww!\" went a howl that made everyone look up \"I'm tired of these owls and wolves,\" Brianna whined \"It's alright, no animals are going to harm you,\" Kiki said as Brianna held on to her arm \"Looks like someone forgot to clean up their front yard,\" Ron replied as he noticed leaves everywhere \"Yea look at the dust on those tombstones,\" Charice said as she passed by some \"Okay kids, this is it…the Mansion,\" The mayor replied as he stopped in his tracks and pointed to it \"OOooohhhhhhh!\" Everyone said as they followed him and looked up \"This place looks centuries old,\" Liza replied \"It seems like nobody has touched it,\" Brandon said \"This place needs a serious makeover,\" Brianna replied Everyone stood and stared at the 200 foot tall stone mansion that seemed over a thousand acres wide. \"Wow this place is big!\" Steve said as he looked up \" I wonder who lives in there,\" Liz said \" Maybe Frankenstein,\" Brianna replied \"A monster,\" Steve said \"or the ghost,\" Brandon replied \"Or werewolf,\" Charice said \"Maybe its P. Diddy,\" Ron said \"Seriously in this house?\" Liz asked \"What…the man owns houses all over the country,\" Ron said \"Or maybe it's the Kardashians,\" Brianna replied, \"In their reality show!\" \"Or maybe its Snooki who wants to get a tan,\" Brandon replied mockingly \"Snooki…this could be Snooki's house. I get to meet her!\" Brianna replied \"Brianna…please don't be naïve,\" Kiki said \"I get to be a star and-\" \"Brianna….we are not in the Jersey Shore or Kardashians reality show!\" Kiki replied \"But…oh well,\" Brianna scoffed \"Maybe its that creature we have been talking about,\" Steve said \"Yeah and he wants to meet us,\" Brandon replied \"Quiet kids, this a serious matter and we have to be stern and brisk about it,\" The Mayor said as he prepared to knock on the door \"Are we sure that anybody's home?\" Brianna asked Suddenly when he lifted his fist to knock the door began to creak. \"Whoa…\" Steve said as the door slowly opened all the way \"What just happened?\" Brianna asked \"The door opened by itself,\" Liz replied \"Why do these doors and gates open by themselves?\" Brianna asked \"It's the ghost,\" Steve said \"No because-\" Kiki said \"No, I don't need your explanation on why doors open and blah!\" Brianna replied \"But I was just-\" Kiki said \"Yea…I already know,\" Brianna said \"There are no ghosts here kid and I am going to prove it to you,\" The Mayor replied \"This is too awesome!\" Brandon replied with an excited look in his eyes \"Now be careful so don't make any sudden moves. We don't know who we are dealing with and something seems strange about this place,\" The Mayor said \"Yeah the same can be said about that wig,\" Brianna whispered \"What? Brianna!\" Kiki replied as she nudged her \"Kidding!\" Brianna said The Mayor took one step inside the door which revealed a dark, empty hallway. \"Hello?\" He asked as he looked around. \"That's odd, no one was at the door when we came in,\" Liz said \"I knew I should have stayed home and IM'd my buddies on Twitter,\" Brianna whined \"Oh stop whining Brianna, we are here so deal with it!\" Kiki said \"Let me get my flashlight out before I fall on my face in the dark,\" Brandon said as he reached in his pocket \"Yeah my MP3 has the coolest lights on it,\" Steve replied as he took it out, \"See?\" \"Oohhh cool!\" Brandon said as the lights flashed like a disco ball \"You think your phone is hot, look at my Blackberry Storm,\" Brianna replied as she flipped out her custom made phone \"Oh be quiet Brianna, your Blackberry is whack, we all know the Droid is the best,\" Ron said as he pulled out his shiny blue phone \"Are we really going to have a \"Whose phone is better than who's contest\"? Kiki asked \"Well I do have a great GPS system on mines,\" Brianna replied \"Oh please, your GPS is so 2002, mines is way more updated,\" Ron said \"Guys, none of your GPS's are better,\" Brandon said, \"Look at my Iphone!\" \"OOohhh pretty!\" Brianna replied \"The reasons why I hang out with them I will never know,\" Kiki thought to herself \"You all keep the noise down or-!\" The Mayor snapped when suddenly a gust of wind blew over them. \"What was that?\" Ron asked \"It's the ghost,\" Steve said \"There is no such thing as gho-\" Kiki replied The gust of wind was cold and made everyone shiver \"Brrrrr…its cold,\" Brianna said \"Why is this place so dark?\" Liz asked as she looked around with her phone flashlight \"Look at those cobwebs,\" Steve said as he pointed to his left to see a flight of stairs that led up to what looked like another floor. \"Look at those stairs, so antique,\" said Charice as she examined them \"Where is that wind coming from?\" Liza asked as she shivered a little when the lightning flashed again. Suddenly the Mayor's torch went out. \"That's not good,\" Brianna replied as the thunder rolled \"Its alright kids, just a minor setback, looks like we arrived in a storm,\" The Mayor said \"Or we came…uninvited,\" Brianna whispered The thunder rumbled again as the group huddled together for safety \"At least we got our phones which never go out during thunderstorms,\" Ron said as he shined the light of his phone around \"Yeah, Thank goodness for my extra powered battery system that doesn't go out,\" Brianna replied as she stared at herself through her phone mirror. \"Hey sis, say Cheese!\" Brandon said as he held up his I Phone and clicked a button \"What-\" Kiki replied when a sudden flash made her blink, \"Are you taking pictures of me?\" \"This is totally going on Facebook,\" Brandon said as he clicked \"Save\" \"You are going to pay for that. Wait until I get home!\" Kiki growled as her brother laughed \"Why is this place so dark? I feel like I am in a scary movie,\" Brianna whimpered \"Well maybe somebody forgot to pay the light bill,\" Brandon replied \"Or they are asleep,\" Brianna said when the lightning flashed. They walked past the cobweb stairs and found a few statues that stood around. \"Why does this hallway feel like it doesn't end?\" Brianna asked \"Because we are constantly tip toeing down it,\" Ron replied \"Okay everyone stay quiet\" The Mayor replied, \"Something about this place feels odd,\" \"Didn't he say that like 10 minutes ago?\" Brianna asked \"Yes so stop texting on your Blackberry,\" Kiki said \"What? I am just telling Mariah she needs to email me the picture of those cute shoes from the JcPenney catalog a.s.a.p.,\" Brianna said as she looked at her phone \"Sure,\" Kiki said as she rolled her eyes Suddenly the lights on everyone's phone shut off \"What! Come on BlackBerry you cant do this. I got you for too much money!\" Brianna said as she hit the buttons on her phone \"Seriously right when I am playing my NBA game?\" Ron asked \"I think we upset somebody,\" Steve replied \"Yea I am upset because my phone is not working!\" Brianna said \"No…we upset the people who live here,\" Steve said \"Well they better help me fix my phone because I am no-\"Brianna snapped when the thunder rolled \"See what you did Brianna!\" Ron replied \"I did nothing!\" Brianna said \"Now the phones are cutting out because of your big mouth!\" He replied \"I did not cause this-\" Brianna yelled when suddenly \"BAM!\" everybody turned around to see the front door shut behind them \"Okay, who shut the door?\" Brianna asked \"It wasn't me,\" Liz said \"It wasn't me,\" Steve replied \"Who was the last one to enter through the door\" The Mayor asked as he turned around \"It wasn't me!\" Brandon said \"I'm innocent!\" Charice replied as the thunder rolled louder and shrieked. The mayor turned back around and continued towards the open door on his right. \"Come on keep up!\" The mayor said as he noticed a portrait against the wall. \"Where are we going?\" Brianna asked \"Just stop asking questions Brianna,\" Kiki replied as she watched the Mayor \"How are we gonna see without our flashlight?\" Brandon asked when suddenly a gust of wind blew and the door that led to the hallway of the portrait started to creak \"Okay the door sound is starting to creep me out,\" Ron said as the Mayor headed towards the hallway \"This place gets weirder,\" Brianna replied Suddenly the door shut and another creaking sound echoed through the hallway \"This place is freaky,\" Charice said as the Mayor turned his head to face the sound. He saw that another door began to open and it was bigger than the last one. \"What is with these doors?\" Brianna asked as she faced the creaking sound and saw a bright light \"OOooHhhhh!\" Brandon and Steve replied together \"What is that?\" Liza asked The Mayor began to walk towards the opening doors to see something unique. There was a light emitting from the doors that led to the hallway. \"SHHH!\" The Mayor said \"everyone quiet,\" The group obeyed as the Mayor got closer and closer to the doors \"Oh wow, look at those statues in the corner,\" Liz said as she pointed to the two statues that stood by the door, \"So antique,\" \"They look like knights,\" Charice said as she stared at the dust covered objects when she walked by. The Mayor stepped by the doors on what looked like a black and white tiled floor. He looked up and the floor seemed to go on for miles. \"What is this?\" \"Whoa!\" Brandon and Steve said as they followed the Mayor into the open space \"It's a room,\" Liz said as she walked inside \"A huge one,\" Charice said \"Look at those windows!\" Brandon pointed to his left to see the 30 foot tall windows \"Cool!\" Steve said \"This place is like a ballroom,\" Liz said \"It is a ballroom,\" Kiki replied \"Hey check out the fireplace!\" Steve said when he pointed across the room as he tried to walk towards it \"Nuh uh Steve,\" The Mayor said as he stopped Steve in his tracks, \"You are staying here like the rest of us,\" \"Oh man,\" Steve grumbled \"Why does this place feel like we are in the 1800's?\" Ron asked looking around \"I don't know, but why does it feel like somebody is watching us?\" Brianna asked as she held arms around her \"Oh please nobody is watching us, we are going to be fine,\" Kiki said when suddenly \"Ding!\" everyone looked up startled \"Okay, that creeped me out,\" Liz replied as she looked up \"What was that?\" Charice asked when she noticed a tall clock covered in dust on her right side with a small bird that stood on top \"Is that a bird?\" Brianna asked as she saw the bird flap its wings \"Caw!\" the bird went as it flew off the clock Everybody watched as the bird flew across the room towards the window when the lightning flashed again \"Why does it feel like that bird came out of nowhere?\" Charice asked The lightning flashed again when everybody turned their eyes to the right side of the room. With the quickness of the flash a door flew wide open on thier right side where they saw a black sheet moving on the floor. \"What was that?\" Brianna asked as she hid behind Kiki The black sheet suddenly disappeared through the door as everyone stared \"Okay that really freaked me out!\" Charice said The mayor took one step towards the area where he saw the black sheet and didn't see anything. \"What do you think happens if he walks all the way in there?\" Brianna asked \"I don't know but this place doesn't feel right,\" Charice said The lightning continued to flash when the mayor got closer \"Why would he go somewhere that doesn't look safe?\" Brianna asked \" Maybe you should go so we can have some peace and quiet!\" Ron replied \"Don't you start with me again!\" Brianna snapped \"Shush!\" Everybody else replied when they turned to the two Nothing seemed to come out of the open space where the black sheet went and everyone watched intently \"What if the monster jumps out there?\" Brianna asked \"What if it's the ghost?\" Steve asked \"What if its that girl from Celebrity Apprentice?\" Ron asked when everyone looked at him \"You really watch too much television,\" Kiki replied as the thunder rumbled and Brianna grabbed on tighter to her \"Its alright kids, I don't see anything,\" The Mayor said when the lightning revealed a tall black figure that quickly disappeared *GASP* everyone went as they stepped back \"I dont like this place,\" Brianna said as she shivered \"What was that?\" Ron asked \"Its the-\" \"No its not Brandon, its probably a reflex from the lightning,\" Kara replied as she watched the Mayor go closer to the door Everyone whispered behind him as he made one step closer to the empty space when suddenly something appeared right before his eyes \"AAAHHHHHH!\" The crowd screamed when the Mayor stood face to face with a skeleton covered figure.

Now Incould go back to Pittsburgh, back to Frankie, back to my new life. Thengospel I'd found would be safe in the hands of Petrocelli. The Church wouldnnever know of them, never would the Vatican hear word of their existence. Petrocelli and I were to meet at a graveyard outside of Rome. I wentncarefully ensuring that no one followed me. When I got to the graveyard annold man sat on a stone bench. No one else was around. I sat beside him andnstated, \"lovely day.\" He nodded staring up at the sky, \"That it is.\" Nonchalantly I passed the ancient scroll over to him, \"Promise thatnthis will never enter a church or be heard of by the Vatican. Give me younword, Petrocelli.\" His eyes stared deeply into mine, \"You have my word. I swear tonChrist that I'll protect this gospel.\" I nodded reassured then stood up, \"I must go now.\" Petrocelli grabbed my arm to get my attention, \"Thank you.\" I knew Inhad done the right thing. The gospel was in the right hands it was safe. My black coat flowed behind me as I walked away. I would never seenhim or the Gospel ever again. This meeting proved dangerous in itself.nAnother one would be stupidity. Now I had to get to the airport. I'd quitnthe Church. I learned I did not believe in their methods. My interestsnwould still be base around religious science but never would I work for thenChurch again.[Chapter 2] Frankie stood by the arrival area. When I saw her beautiful face minenbrightened. A few steps away from her I dropped my bag and kissed her softnlips. Her touches light and warm. I picked up my bag and she gently took mynhand. We wandered through the crowds of people and into a taxi. Once we got to her apartment I felt like I was at home. Frankiensmiled, \"You like it? I've been trying to make it homey for your arrival.\" \"The place looks wonderful.\" I replied. She pulled me close to her by my shirt whispering, \"I'm happy younlost that white neck thing.\" I laughed, \"Yah well, it started to bother my neck.\" \"Did you take care of the missing Gospel?\" Frankie asked menseriously. \"Yes, it's in safe hands.\" \"Thank God!\" She stared past the ceiling high to the Heavens. For once I could kiss her without feeling any guilt. I could lienbeside her in a bed without feeling as though I've committed a travestynagainst the Church. Embracing her in my arms I lost all reason that Insearched for. She made everything seem so simple. I lifted her small wristsninto my view examining her scars. They were vague. Almost completelynunnoticeable and I let my lips slide across them. \"They took out the stitches when you were gone.\" Frankie said staringnat the light scars. \"I can barely notice that any wounds were made here.\" I observed. She laughed in her carefree way, \"I know! Isn't it great!\" I went into the bathroom and got dressed into some more comfynclothes. Then I brushed my teeth. When I came out Frankie sat praying onnthe floor. I smiled broadly. After her stigmatic experience she hadnregained a new faith. Neither of us would worship in a huge church evernagain but we could pray silently at home. Quietly I kneeled down beside her. I prayed to God without words. Inthanked him for all that he had given me; Frankie, a new life, and a newnunderstanding of the world around me. Frankie's sweet kisses brought me outnof my trance. She lay on her bed and I went and lay beside her. My armsnheld her close to me and our heads touched. There was a certain value in the relationship we had. I valued how wencould just lay here in each other's arms sleeping blissfully.n Her voice came soothingly, \"it's a wonder that the Church didn'tnexcommunicate you. They just let you walk off?\" \"Yes, they let me walk off.\" I didn't believe it at the time either. \"Strange.\" She judged. Then we became silent. We fell asleep in thencomfort of each other's arms.[Chapter 3] Something awoke me. My eyes popped open and almost out of theirnsockets. I heard a distinct bang. Where had it come from? Again somethingnboomed, three times. I saw nothing, the door. Someone was knocking at thendoor. Just as I was about to get up and answer it but I didn't have to. Thendoors were forced open. A man dressed in religious attire entered. I'd seennhim at the Vatican a few times. \"What in God's name are you doing here?\" I asked without anger. \"I've come as a representative of the Vatican. A group of us havendecided that the two of you know too much and are a threat to thenreputation of the Church. I'm to carry out your execution.\" His accent wasnstrong and strict. He kept a strict tone. \"What the hell are you talking about?\" I yelled. Frankie stirred anbit in her slumber but she did not wake up. She was a strong sleepernprobably wrapped up in her own dreams. The man lifted a pillow with a blank expression on his face. \"What, a pillow fight to the death?\" I laughed. \"Not exactly\" he answered and I heard a gun shot. Feather's floatednthrough the air. I looked over at Frankie. She bled. There was blood comingnfrom a hole in her head but still she slept, undisturbed. I got up to lungenat him but then another shot was fired. My chest burned. Smoke rose fromnthe middle of my chest. I couldn't breathe. I fell back on the bed. I woke up, again. I woke to find Frankie sleeping beside me. Therenwas no blood anywhere. I scooped her up into my arms, I hugged her. Shenwoke up smiling, \"wow. nice way to wake up.\" She stared up at me, sonangelic. Most of the time she seemed to glow and resemble an angel. Incouldn't take my eyes off her. Inside she was so beautiful, outside she wasnso beautiful. \"Is something wrong?\" she questioned. She's been through so much. Did she really need this right now? \"Nonnothing's wrong. everything's perfect.\" I lied through my teeth but knew itnwas best.

Tragic, huh? Anyway, this was just another crazy little idea. Hope you enjoy! If anyone wants, feel free to take! Frankie and Andrew round a corner and press themselves against a building, hoping to escape from Milou. Just when they think they have gotten away, she is suddenly in front of them. \"I found you! No, don't leave me!! I don't belong!\" Frankie and Andrew exchange glances. \"I have an idea,\" Andrew whispers. Milou is looking around anxiously. \"If we head back towards the therapy group, and make her think we're going back, she might leave.\" Frankie nods and they set back off. The plan is to go down the hall, past the group, and back outside through the rear exit. Milou, however, kills that plan as they get near the groups meeting room. \"No! Not back in there!\" This draws Linda out, along with 3 nurses. \"Oh, welcome back you three! Nurses… escort them in!\" The last 3 words are said with a frighteningly evil tone. Linda, Frankie, Andrew and Milou all head back in; the door slams and is locked behind them. Somehow, in the 5 minutes Frankie and Andrew have been gone, more candy appeared. Kim now has Jelly Bellys; Gabs has even more Skittles; Sylvia is armed with M Smenzer has Hershey's Miniatures; and even Milou has mint chocolate. Frankie and Andrew look around in confusion. Sylvia makes her way over, obviously trying to look discreet. \"Don't worry, you're not crazy! It's just one of HER fan fics, I'm telling you!\" she whispers urgently. Frankie nods; she and Andrew begin to inch away. Sylvia is distracted by a mysteriously airborne Skittle, allowing them to move over to where Smenzer was. She glares at them. \"I am totally not addicted,\" she hisses. \"We believe you,\" Frankie says quickly. Smenzer nods, apparently satisfied. She shoves a few Hershey's Minis in her mouth, followed by more Skittles. The duo once again starts inching away, and end up near Milou. She gives them an evil glare. \"I don't belong here!\" she howls. Andrew hands her a few Skittles; they seem to settle her down, however momentarily. He and Frankie look up and see Gabs, who is apparently involved in a deep discussion with her Skittles. She glares at the green Skittles, then yells something at the yellow before looking amazed by the orange. She then laughs at something \"said\" by either the red or purple group. Frankie and Andrew look at her, then back at each other, and then move in a different direction. Kim is whispering more advice to Linda. \"You really shouldn't try to eat Skittles with all your dogs watching. They steal them.\" Linda nods seriously. There is a sudden shout from Gabs. \"Hey now!\" They all turn to see Sylvia giggling, clutching M&M;'s in her left hand. Gabs is rubbing her nose, where a trace of chocolate still remains. She looks around wildly, searching for the culprit. Sylvia's snorts of laughter give her away. \"Why that you did do?\" Gabs demands, mixing up her words. \"It's all just your fan fic! Why don't you tell us why I did that?\" It is hard for the group not to laugh at Gabs expression; she has \"you are an idiot\" clearly written across her face as she looks at Sylvia. \"Oooh!\" Sylvia growls angrily, hurling more M&M;'s at Gabs, who retrieves a bag of Tropical Skittles and begins launching away. Linda seems to have given up all hopes of therapy this week, and is sitting with her feet on a table, looking annoyed at the Furby Kim is holding by her ear. \"Make it shut up!\" Linda pleads. Kim just giggles madly and turns the Furby upside down again. Linda sighs. Frankie and Andrew look at the door desperately. \"There is no escape,\" Andrew whispers. \"I really wish I could do the speaking in Aramaic thing right now,\" Frankie replies just as quietly. \"Why?\" Andrew asks curiously. \"Maybe I could scare them into shutting up or something.\" She thinks about this briefly. \"But it seems more likely that they would think it hilarious,\" she adds. Andrew is about to reply when a sword bursts through the wall. He and Frankie jump back; no one else seems to notice. The sword quickly cuts a huge hole in the wall and a now familiar face appears. Demon grins maniacally as she pokes her head in and looks around. The grin slowly fades into confusion. She glances at a slip of paper in her hand, then back into the group. \"Damn! Wrong room!\" she grins sheepishly and runs down the hall, screaming maniacally. Frankie stares after her and looks about ready to cry. \"Not fair! How can they let a loony like THAT run loose, and lock up people like us?\" Andrew shakes his head. \"Let's make a run for it,\" he says, indicating the gap in the wall. Frankie nods. Just as they get close enough to get through, a nurse appears. \"I'll fiz that! You get back to your therapy!\" Frankie sighs. She and Andrew sit near Smenzer, thinking that she is possibly the sanest person in that group. She looks up at them curiously as she puts a few more Skittles in her mouth. \"Do you believe me?\" she whispers rather loudly. \"About what?\" Frankie asks warily. \"Not being addicted!\" Smenzer says incredulously. \"Um… yeah, sure…\" Andrew replies. Smenzer nods in satisfaction and slowly turns her head to watch her bowl of Skittles. She starts to look suspicious upon spotting a hand moving towards them. The hand then reaches into the bowl and grabs a few. Smenzers eyes widen in rage; she jumps up on her chair. \"No!\" she screams, dramatically and in slow motion. She proceeds to dive over the table and tackle the owner of the hand- who turns out to be Milou. \"My Skittles!\" Smenzer looks around quickly. \"Not that I'm addicted… but they're mine!\" Milou takes a step back. \"I don't belong here!\" Smenzer clutches her bowl tighter to her. \"Mine!\" she snaps, backing away. Milou glares at her, then eats some popcorn. She also begins backing up. Frankie and Andrew decide that perhaps Smenzer isn't the sanest person there. Even worse, Frankie thinks, maybe she is. They move towards Linda and Kim; the latter seems to have invented a new form of torture, using her Furby. She also seems to be the only one there not actively eating any Skittles, choosing instead to inhale her Jelly Bellys. Frankie and Andrew glance over to see Gabs and Sylvia alternating between evil glares and throwing candy. Milou seems to be looking for a way out. Smenzer is insisting, to no one in particular, that she doesn't belong. And Linda appears to have a headache. She stands up suddenly. \"Session over!\" she hollers. \"However, you are ALL expected to be here next week! And remember, I know where each and every one of you live, so if you're not here, I'll send someone to get you! Retta will be returning to help me run this loony bin next week, and we'll also have a few more people in need of therapy. So, I WILL see you all then!\" Frankie, Andrew. Smenzer, and Milou all rush for freedom; Kim runs right into Demon, and then runs for her life; Gabs and Sylvia seem content to stay right where they are, until Linda threatens Gabs with teletubbies. She then gets up and runs even faster than Milou. Sylvia chases her, still screaming aboiut a fan fic conspiracy. And Linda collapses into a chair, thankful to finally have peace and quiet.

Please enjoy! Unfortunately, I don't own nor Peter, neither any other part of this story (can't even play tennis :( ). „Idiot\", mumbled to herself Lizzie shaking her head with disbelief. How could have so experienced player just dropped his rocket and ran toward some unknown service girl? After second glance, however, her head tilted to the side a little as her attention was caught by the simple fact of the way in which 'this looser' (as she named him in her head) removed the strands of hair from the girl's face. He was speaking something to her, soothing her pain away. And then, suddenly, he reached for her and scooped her up from the ground in one swift move. Usually not the sit-still kind of girl, Lizzie stopped her treadmill and stood watching mesmerized as the player personally took the service girl behind the fence to get her faster to the medical assistance. And when the close-up was made even so used to being surrounded by good-looking men and flirtatious Lizzie Bradbury couldn't have helped herself and checked his muscled arms out. Then the carried maiden was shown. She regained her conscious back and was probably a little worried he might have dropped her, because her right arm was clinching around the man's neck. Lizzie's eyes widened a little as she saw that the British whispered something to the girl's ear. A few chills started creeping down her spine but snap!, and the vision was set back on the court where Tommy Hass was explaining something to the main judge, gesticulating wildly. Bored, Liz switched her treadmill on again and took a sip of water from the sitting on the nearby table bottle. She turned her head trying to relax the cervical muscles. After two more long shots of the arguing player, cameraman came back to the action taking place in the background. Viewers could have seen how the medical staff was attentively taking care of the bruise on the temple of the hitten service girl. All of this was observed by the kneeling in the vicinity perpetrator. The embarrassment clearly written on his face made him look younger and so likeable in the same time, that the 'American wonder-child of tennis' started thinking why on Earth hadn't she noticed him on any tournament yet. 'Peter Colt' , Lizzie repeated the name in her head after the commentators. But this time there was no spite in the undertone of it. 'Peter Colt..., what an interesting man could be...' , she thought when the broadcast was stopped and the studio of the sport programme appeared on the screen. Lizzie smiled to herself as she heard in the radio that Peter Colt, 'the first gentleman of the court' as she liked to call him in her thoughts, had gotten the wild card to play on the Wimbledon. The minute she heard the news, decision was made. She was going to meet him. The door slammed behind him loudly. Lizzie giggled to herself softly, shaking her head and her ponytail jumped lightly. Such a cutie , corners of her lips stayed turned up, and his face! Oh, the perfect 'O' his mouth made. Herecame the chuckle and Lizzie wrapped the towel tighter around her waist, walking out to her bedroom. Since the moment she had heard the information about Peter Colt's participation in the tournament, Lizzie's mind ran the miles to find some way to cross her path with him. She wasn't even sure what made her so eager of this acquittance in the first place. Her first assumption was that it could have been caused by the gentleness showed by him toward the service girl hitten by his service ball two years ago. But it was nonsense! - she told herself. It must have been his physique, some kind of a strange TV-broadcast caused sexual attraction. Yes, somehow it sounded more reasonable to the young tennis star. So to confront her mind's images with the real, flesh and bone man, Peter Colt, resolute and self-confident Lizzie Bradbury decided to ask for a favour the most influential person in the whole hotel. The receptionist. Two VIP tickets and few autographs later, the promise was made that in the upcoming chaos of arriving mass of the tennis players, Peter Colt was going to be misdirected to her penthouse for their first rendezvous. But when she asked for this little help, she had never thought that the timing would be so unfortunate. It wasn't so that she felt embarrassed of her state of undress, but Peter felt clearly uneasy about it. Though she could have sworn that somewhere behind these baby blue eyes she saw the appreciation for the view. The mere thought made her smile again.

Lizzie looked unseeingly forward, resting on her side, one hand tucked under her head, stray strands of blonde hair falling across her face. She could feel the warm body of her equally naked husband behind her. One of his arms was draped over her side, her own resting upon it. Making up her mind, she pushed back lightly against Peter's body and squeezed his arm. \"I want to retire,\" she said suddenly, her eyes still on the hotel window before her. \"Hmm?\" mumbled her semi-awake husband as he lifted his head and rested it on the gap between her neck and shoulder, ready to succumb to slumber once again. She rolled onto her back and looked up at him seriously. \"I want to retire,\" she repeated. \"Okay.\" \"That's it?\" said Lizzie incredulously. \"No discussion?\" \"What's there to dis...?\" He was cut off as his angry wife pushed his chest and got out of bed, pulling on a white shirt of his in the process. \"It's my career,\" she reasoned. He sat up on the bed, the sheet falling to his waist as he rested his arms on his bent knees and watched Lizzie pace the room, questioning and answering herself in turn as she railed.

Disclaimer: I don't own the characters of Wimbledon, and no infringement is intended, nor profit being made. After the wedding (once the doves were back in their cages, all the white feathers raked up off the lawn), Dieter drove the couple to the airport. In the back of the car, Lizzie's hair was coming loose -- it trailed over Peter's shoulder as she slept, and Peter ran gentle fingers over its strands. His eyes met Dieter's in the mirror. Dieter couldn't help but see the stunned smile lurking there. He felt his own face stretch in something like a grin, and looked back to the road, concentrating on the lines as the setting sun turned the world gold. They blurred into abstraction after a while and in his head became white wings beating against the heavy summer air; Lizzie's simple skirts swirling over Peter's scuffed wingtips. In the back of the car, Peter's face seemed pale and tired under the freckles, and his hair (that his mother had so carefully tamed before the ceremony, while he tried to swat her hands away) was sweaty, curling over his forehead. He slumped in the leather seat, rumpling his tux. One arm curved around Lizzie's shoulders as she softly snored. Dieter, glancing back (for the hundredth time? The thousandth.) thought he'd rarely seen his friend so happy. And that thought, while warming him, left him feeling unbalanced, as though he was standing with his face towards a space heater, and his back to a freezing, empty room. \"No, seriously, it's brilliant!\" Peter's voice was warm in Dieter's ear, and he cocked his head to keep the phone more securely in place. \"The run-away-to-America-to-escape-the-dissapointed-country-club-women plan? How brilliant can that be? You won't be able to escape them there. You can't drive worth shit on the right side of the road.\" Dieter paused, the door to the refrigerator half shut. The light from inside fell over his bare feet. \"You're not letting Lizzie drive, are you? Only I've heard stories . . .\" \"Oh, for Christ's sake. She's only mangled two cars beyond recognition. The third is still quite drivable.\" \"Rental agencies refuse to give her a car without massive insurance coverage.\" \"She's quite capable! One or two little hiccups . . .\" \"That last wreck made international news.\" Dieter finally remembered to close the door, and the kitchen went dark. \"Only because she was playing in the US Open. And no one got hurt, anyway.\" \"Well, that's alright then. I suppose you can afford to keep buying new cars.\" \"Like I'd let her drive my car. No, she can drive those shit American monstrosities down the wrong side of the road.\" The fondness in Peter's voice was unmistakable, and Dieter smiled to hear it. He could imagine the little boy grin on Peter's face, the sheepish duck of his chin. \"Brilliant plan, then. Let Lizzie do the driving and you'll both do fine.\" Dieter yawned, and caught a glimpse of the clock over the stove. Half past three. \"Look, Peter, I've got to get on. Give your lady my love?\" \"Absolutely. Best of luck tomorrow! Knock him back into his diapers.\" \"You know, we were that young, once. And the kid's not bad on the court.\" \"But you're better. You'll beat him in straight sets.\" The next day, as the line judge called out the final score, Dieter pressed his forehead to the edge of his racket, feeling his sweat slick hair catch on the strings. Gulping air, trying to keep his shaking knees from buckling, he sent a brief and wordless thought of thanks Peter's way, and simultaneously cursed him for keeping him up so late. If he didn't look, he could imagine his friend leaning back in his seat in the stands, smiling brightly, as if to say, \"See? I said you'd do it.\" And their eyes would meet clearly, as though there were no crowd at all. Once or twice, since the wedding, Dieter dreamed that Peter had never walked into Lizzie Bradbury's hotel room. He'd competed Wimbledon as if it were his duty, his last hoorah. And he'd lost with his customary good grace and good nature, having reached a respectable, if uninspiring, rank. In those dreams, Dieter watched Peter's tired eyes settle into a bewildered sort of acceptance. He came to visit, to Peter's new tennis directorship at the club, and noticed every time he glanced at his etched name plate with a numb kind of shock, quickly glossed over with a smile and a laugh. He watched Peter keep just out of arms length of the women at the club, watched him shake hands with their husbands and grit his teeth every time one of the well padded bankers got his name wrong. Eventually, he stopped correcting them when they missed his former tennis ranking. Then, in the dreams, Dieter would challenge his friend to a match. They would play like they used to, just the two of them and a tennis ball on that fine private court (where the women were as expensive, and as well maintained, as the lawn). And Dieter would see the old fires smoldering in Peter's eyes. For a moment, he would move with that old reckless grace, diving frantically for the ball on the far edge of the court. He would grin madly, and mock when Dieter couldn't keep up. Sometimes, in the dream, Dieter won the match, with a last minute magnificent rally. More often, Peter won, easily. Either way, as the bankers and their wives applauded, Peter would drape an arm over Dieter's shoulders, and Dieter would feel his breathy laugh against his ear. And Dieter would wake, not knowing if the dream had been a nightmare, or a fantasy. Then, turning restlessly in his sheets, he would see the picture on his dresser, of Peter, ecstatic, on the grounds at Wimbledon after his win. Most nights, this would make him feel extraordinarily guilty. Most nights. \"Lizzie, really, he'll love it.\" Dieter assured her. She sounded younger over the line, less sure of herself. \"I know he likes taking care of kids, but it's such a rough neighborhood, you know? It couldn't be more different than his home. I'm not saying he's a snob or anything, but, I mean, he practically grew up an aristocrat. And here it's all chain link and padlocks and graffiti and trash . . .\" \"And a tennis court, and kids who want to learn, and you, mocking him from the other side of that chain link fence. He'll never feel more at home.\" Dieter, surprised at the pang that comment sent through him, masked the bitterness in his voice with a laugh. \"He'll think it's fantastic.\" \"But he never wanted to take that job at the country club . . .\" \"Are you trying to talk yourself out of setting him up with an interview? Because taking that old position was settling for something stable when he thought he'd never find something better.\" Dieter closed his eyes, and shrugged to himself before continuing. \"Then he found you.\" He almost didn't notice the resignation in his voice. When Lizzie didn't answer for a moment, Dieter swallowed, oddly nervous. \"Do you think so?\" She asked, finally, and the little girl hope in her voice coaxed a grin out of Dieter. Almost a grin. At least a smile. And he was sincere when he replied, \"Yes. You were very good for him, Lizzie. \"Set up the interview.\" Dieter hung up the phone, ruthlessly stamping down on the nagging little voice in his head that protested that this new job would keep Peter in the States indefinitely. Peter really would be happy teaching kids to play tennis. He'd be happy doing almost anything with Lizzie there to cheer him on. He insisted to himself that this was not a bad thing. More than once, since the wedding, Dieter dreamed of standing on the court. His shoes were scuffed and grass stained, and the murmur of the crowd was shading into expectant silence. The sun hung heavy over his back, and cast his shadow over the ball as he bounced it once, twice. When he drew his arm back (racket catching the light in the sky) he could feel the weight of that heavy sun as he threw himself into the serve. It was good, that serve, just skimming the net, lancing into the far corner as if it were laser sighted. And Dieter balled a fist in triumph, feeling his muscles loose and ready for a volley. But the triumph stalled as the line judge called the score, because there was no volley. He held every serve, and every serve was an ace. Of course they were. There was no one standing on the other side of the net. And in the dream, the heat from the sun overhead faded as the game progressed, and featureless clouds obscured the sky. He grew cold, and his fingers fumbled as he shivered. The last serve knocked heavily into the net, sending the ball thudding back on his side of the court. It came to a rest at his feet, just as the clouds let loose a downpour. And he stood, staring at it, until the rain ran in icy rivulets into his eyes. His racket hung at the end of his arm like a dead thing. Then, the squelch on his sodden shoes on the empty court louder than the rain, he walked, head down, into the dark. After this dream, he would wake tangled in his sheets, sweating, gasping as if he'd just clawed his way through straight sets. Of course this was a nightmare. Strangely, he never felt guilty after this one. Only lost. He refused (what other option did he have?) to admit, even in dreams, even in nightmares, that he kept expecting Peter to return his serve.

Last years final had been annembarrassment by anyone's standards but by his own it was like henhad never played tennis, his victory over Rafael the week before innMadrid in he final had given him a great confidence boast and he wasnintending to take it all the way. \" Thisntime I will fight for every point until it kills me, I'll show themnthat I'm not done yet\" Rogernthought to himself as he struck the ball like would during annofficial match, peppering the court and smiling at the popping soundnthat echoed around the empty stadium as his racket made contact withnthe ball.

ISW/ Nefertiri The sound of rackets hitting balls had often laced his sleep, But this time, it wasn't the dreams of the court. And this time, it was inducing a pounding in his already sore enough head. Damned bloody headache. \"Wake up, sleepy, you wanna practice or not?\" Lizzie. Love. Choose one. If you had asked Peter that, he couldn't have chosen, to him they meant the same thing . And a second love was the game. THE game. But that wasn't his life anymore. No, Lizzie was his life now. Wimbledon was over, he'd won it and quit. And it felt good. No pressure to make the score, to be in love. It felt real good. \"Soon, Lizzie,\" he rolled over, his voice and body tired for the game of the day before. The game that made his career….and in a sense broke it. His last professional game. His pre-retirement game. Retirement. The word sounded odd next to his name, his age, thirty-one. But that was old in tennis years. Too old for the game. He sure hoped not. \"Everything is so contradictory!\" he said, rolling over onto his sore back. He needed another acupuncture treatment, that last swing….well he hadn't felt in then, but he felt it now. His damn back… \"What's contradictory?\" Lizzie, there she was again, back to take away all his stupid thoughts about life that made him so confused. So far, he'd done a decent job on his own, but she made it better. \"Life…\" he groaned and rolled over again. \"Don't you remember any of those cliché sayings?\" Lizzie was rubbing his back, now. And it felt sooo good. \"Like what?\" \"Oh, like, don't let life get you down?\" she even smelt good. Bloody clichés. The damned bloody clichés. But her voice was so soothing, like honey. Like a nice long steam soaking after a good hard, long game with Dieter. Dieter, know that was an idea. \"What is it?\" Lizzie. She had noticed the way he had shifted. \"Well, just supposing that life isn't so bad after all,\" But, as always she was mischievously curious. Oh that quirky smile. \"And what's changed your mind?\" I have friends. \"Well, for starters, there's the fact that your father finally let us hook up,\" Another crooked grin. \"And…?\" Dieter, likes to practice with me. \"My parents aren't splitting up,\" \"Now you're just making things up,\" Damn. \"Am Not!\" \"Are too,\" \"Now this is just too cliché. Where's that tennis racquet?\" Slowly easing himself up, Peter winced. He couldn't believe he was doing this. Just another game, Peter. Now it's not Wimbledon, so now it's not a big deal. It's just a game with your girlfriend. And he was back to groaning about life again. It was a miserable little circle. It wasn't ending soon, and Peter Colt knew he'd better get used to it. He'd known that for a long time. Had he ever gotten used to it? No, but that's besides the point. No go play tennis with Lizzie and stop moaning about your wonderful life. And for the first time that morning, Peter smiled. But that might have been because Lizzie and he had begun to kiss. ","Summary":" A/N: Watched it for the first time on line.

They said so much to her, like a book that was so easy for her to read. She held his hand, loving the feel of his warm skin against hers. He was so perfect. Great looks and a great body, the same interests as her own and he was kind, compassionate, everything she wanted in a man. And yet… \" Alexandria. You do not even know him that well.

Dieter looked up. \"Is there something wrong Alexa?\" he asked, stroking her soft pale cheek. Alexandria shook her head, smiling at the tenderness with which he spoke his nickname for her. This was one of the reasons she loved him so much. He just had such a nice and kind personality. Dieter wrapped his warm, muscular arms around her, hugging her body close to his own. Alexandria lifted her head, drowning herself in the loving emotion in his eyes. He brought his lips to hers, enjoying the feel of her soft lips, slipping his tongue into her mouth, hands held firmly on her hips. Alexandria moaned with content, allowing Dieter to play with her tongue.

But before Alexandria could reply, Dieter had moved his lips over hers in a passionate kiss. Alexandria sighed into the kiss, allowing happiness to consume her.

Or too perfect. If you like happy endings, happy Wimbledon, happy anything, please don't complain to me if you read this anyhow. You won't like it. Now, are we quite ready? Yes? All right, then. \"What do you mean you're miserable?\" Elizabeth just stared, far away. She looked so beautiful, though her blues eyes were rimmed with red and her soft face streaked with tearful make up. \"There aren't a lot of other definitions of miserable, Peter.\" \"God, Lizzie. You know what I meant.\" \"You should know what I meant, too.\" Peter got up. He was pacing, running a hand through his hair. He never could stay still, especially not when he was upset. \"Are you leaving me?\" Elizabeth mumbled. \"Maybe you could do me the great pleasure of speaking up,\" he said. His voiced was pinched with the restraint of not yelling at her. \"I don't know. I want some…time.\" \"Time for what? You want time? Here,\" he took off his watch, (really, a piece of shit given to him by a sponsor a year back), and handed to her. She held it limply in her small hand, as though it were a small, dead bird. \"Now you've got all my time and you've got all your time too. Is that enough bloody time for you?\" \"Peter…\" \"What?

Don't expect me back. Ever.\" \"You're being dramatic.\" \"I'm not the one who needs bloody time,\" he called over his shoulder on his way out. He stopped and came back quickly. \"What do you need time for? Time to get your hair and nails done? More time to shop for more overpriced shit you'll never wear? More time to take off for weeks to do God knows what with whatever aging athlete sees you naked?\" \"Peter, every marriage has problems. We're just experiencing a very normal stage all couples go through. Getting personal and loud are just ways of coping with this stress.\" \"Are you fucking your therapist?\" he blurted out. \"You know about my therapist?\" \"His wife called to ask our address. Seems she had something to mail.\" Shamefully, she looked at the floor, swallowing her tears. \"Probably a party invite,\" he was back by the door again. \"If you need anything, kindly fuck off. I'll be out for the night,\" he said, unable to turn and face her. If he had, she would have seen how he was barely keeping it together. The door shut behind him, he finally sat and wept. It wasn't the manly sort where a single tear creeps out; instead it was unabashed, out and out blubbering. Quite pathetic, really. He made his way on foot to a pub. It must've been a two-mile walk, but what did he care? On a good day it wouldn't have fazed him, and on a night like this it could've been two hundred miles and he wouldn't have felt a damned thing. As though he had just realized where he was, he looked around. It was a discreet sort of place. He doubted there was any chance of his picture being taken here. The room was near empty, what few patrons were grouped at the bar. The regulars were older men, potbellied and permanently sweaty and red. A few women leered at him, their suggestively low-cut tops instantly making his skin crawl. There were exactly four women in that pub that night, three between the ages of 45-55 in too much make up and smoking religiously, who obviously came in a group, and then there was the forth. She stood out like a fork of lightening in the sky. Well, it wasn't a difficult feat, as she still had all her teeth and was a good two decades younger than any of the other women in the room. Still it was her face that drew him in. It wouldn't be true to say he had never wanted anyone as much as he wanted her in that minute. He had unquestioningly wanted Lizzie far more. But for the moment, he wanted to forget. For the night, he was someone else. He didn't play tennis, he went home with strangers all the time, and oh bloody Hell he was still wearing his wedding ring. In a manner he believed to be discreet, he slipped off his ring, into his pocket. \"Hi,\" he said, sidling up to the bar. \"I'm Eric.\" Yes, brilliant use of a fake name! \"I'm Lily,\" she said. He noticed her decidedly un-British accent. \"Oh, you're an American?\" \"Yes, unfortunately,\" she replied, imitating his accent. \"That was quite good actually,\" amazingly, he wasn't lying. \"You been here long?\" \"Feels like ages,\" she continued, dropping the accent soon after. \"No, just a few months.\" \"Work?\" he guessed. \"Yep.\" Well, that went swimmingly. It appears the conversation is over. \"Can I buy you a drink?\" \"Can I tell you that's a corny line?\" \"Can I do it anyways?\" She gestured to the bartender. \"This is my last one.\" Come on, think of something to say. Anything, do anything to continue talking to her. She'll leave soon and then you'll have to think about Lizzie and the baby and, no, no, wait. Stop. This is your time; she's having an affair with her blood shrink! \"So, do you have any tattoos, Lily?\" She turned away. Oh bollocks, fucked that one up. Wait, what's she doing? She lifted up her hair, showing him the back of her neck, which declared, 'Dystopian' in fairly large letters. \"Eric, I want you to come back to my hotel with me.\" \"Well, if I must,\" he sighed. He was nervous. He tried a bit of nervous laughter. \"You're lucky you're so damned cute.\" \"And why's that, exactly?\" he reached out and held her hand. It felt nice, and different. It wasn't Lizzie's hand and maybe that was what was so exciting. \"I don't usually sleep with married men.\" \"You know about that?\" \"Yep. When you're out in the sun as often as you obviously are, you tend to tan. You've got a bright, white target on your right ring finger.\" \"We're separated,\" he said. He pulled her close suddenly, into the light of a shop window. \"You're very beautiful.\" And I thought you would be dumb. Guess I was wrong. Oh, better not tell her that. \"Why don't you kiss me?\" and as soon as she said it, he did. It was fast and hot, lots of confusing twists. The newness was intoxicating. And for the first time that night, he wasn't thinking of Lizzie. He wasn't thinking of her when Lily had her legs around him in some random recessed doorway. Or when he had a hand up her shirt and skirt in the elevator. He wasn't thinking of Lizzie at all. And it felt good. \"Let's take a shower,\" was a marvelous idea, suggested in an eager, sexy voice by a stranger. \"Lily.\" He grabbed her and carried her off to the bathroom. Whatever work she was doing here, she must've been getting paid a fortune. The room was bloody huge. \"I've a better idea,\" he said, looking at the tub. She leant to turn the tap and he couldn't wait any longer. Later, they sat out on the balcony, she on his lap and both of them still naked, she smoked a cigarette. She offered him a puff. \"No, I shouldn't.\" \"You look like a smoker,\" she said. \"I smoked a little when I was a lot younger, but I quit.\" \"Start again,\" she said. She inhaled and kissed him. He felt the warm tobacco smoke fill him up. \"Damn. Give us one of those,\" he said. She handed him that, and a lighter. Soon, though, like all good things reality came crashing down like a poorly built suspension bridge. First, his ring tumbled from his pocket as he yanked on his trousers. Chasing it down with a swear, he got up off his knees to find he'd put his hand on a massive stack of papers. \"What's this Lily?\" She wrapped her arms around him from behind. \"How many times did we manage to fuck? I lost track.\" \"A million. What is this, Lily?\" \"A movie script, Eric.\" \"A movie script?\" \"Yeah,\" she stopped. \"You honestly didn't know?\" \"You're an actress?\" \"I thought, well, you used a fake name and I thought you knew me too, and, and, oh God.\" He turned around and reestablished their contact. She was so small in his arms. \"I'm sorry, Peter.\" \"Yeah,\" he felt a weird kind of relief coursing through his veins. \"I'm not.\" \"Well if you're not sorry there's no way I am.\" He laughed a little. \"If there are any pictures, I'm sorry.\" \"I didn't see anyone. I wouldn't worry about it.\" \"I'm not worried for me, this could only improve my image. I'm worried for you. You're supposed to be some kind of family man now.\" \"My wife's having an affair with her therapist.\" \"Rough. Rough and cliché.\" \"Let's go out for another cigarette.\" \"And then, let's double that million.\" In the morning, he stumbled out, hung over and exhausted. He managed to walk back, ready for a shower and a nap. \"Where were you all night? You didn't have your phone or anything!\" \"I was out. I slept at a hotel,\" partially true. \"I'm not quite as mad at you as I was last night.\" Also true. \"Oh, thank goodness,\" she said with mock relief. \"It's not that simple, Peter.\" \"It was as simple as, 'I just need some time, Petey,' last night.\" \"You got a letter,\" she said, before charging angrily out of the room. He opened it. Inside, he found snapshots of his wife, his Lizzie, undressed, posed and smiling at the photographer. He felt anger unlike any he had felt before and once more took off. The letter was from the therapist's wife. This time, driving, he got to Lily's hotel in no time at all. As he got out of the car, he realized he wasn't going to be able to forgive Lizzie, not for a very long time. Damn, now he was the one who wanted, never mind. That's not important. He got up to her room and knocked. She answered the door near naked, looking tired. She wore only her underwear. \"You always answer the door like that?\" \"Only when I know it's you.\" \"Come out with me. Let's grab breakfast.\" \"Give me two minutes.\" \"I can wait,\" he said, pushing in to her room. He felt edgy and paranoid, like she had someone else in the room at this very moment. She didn't though; he knew that in the deep, rational part of his mind. She dressed rather low-key, jeans and a tee shirt, though she donned enormous sunglasses. In the lobby he grabbed and kissed her. On the way to the car, he picked her up, spun around and set her down. At the little greasy spoon diner he held her hand and kissed her every chance he got. He drove the two of them back to her hotel and they had sex in his car, in the underground garage. He'd never felt so uninhibited in public before. \"We wouldn't have managed that if you were any taller,\" he said, squeezing her close to him. \"Let's get back to my room?\" she suggested. \"That is the best idea you've had so far, other than the one with the whipped cream and the—\" \"Please,\" she interrupted. \"Let a lady keep her modesty.\" There's a strange thing that happens when people are too distracted by each other. They let down their guards too far, start to ignore their surroundings and most importantly for celebrities, they forget to watch for cameras. The very next day, the pictures were everywhere. Pictures of them kissing, holding hands, even a couple of them on her balcony. There were rumors of security camera footage from the elevator and the garage. The day after, even more pictures were released. This time, many were of the lovely Lizzie, bearing it all. Tastefully censored, of course, and strictly contained to the Internet. It was the scandal to end all scandals for all of their respective careers. Lily, she would be fine. She'd disappear for a while and maybe everyone would forget. Or at least, they'd stop mentioning it once it was old news. Lizzie, however, received the worst of it. The story was spun in the worst way for her. She was demanding, domineering, wouldn't let poor Peter see anyone, especially not other women. Post-partum rumors, drug rumors, she was even rumored to have adopted a baby and faked her whole pregnancy. The media's timeline went like this: nude pictures discovered, Peter is devastated for several months and cultivates friendship with actress Lily, eventually two discover love together, enraged wife tips off paparazzi and leaks the story herself. Why she would leak the photos and the affair with the therapist is never really explained. Who cares? In the end, during the private divorce hearings, Peter discovered he wasn't the father of his son. After that, he never spoke to Lizzie again. He and Lily lasted a few months, ending it when she moved back to L.A. And then, it was just Peter. Alone. (Lily isn't based on any real actress. Lizzie and Peter are fictional sports stars so I threw in a fictional actress. She's older than Lizzie, brown hair, green eyes. Smart and indulgent.)

It was a lovely sort of place. Beautifully pre-furnished with views over the best and most beautiful parts of the city, and at the same time, completely private. But at the moment… Lizzie was far too pre-occupied to enjoy the view. Stupefied completely, she wasn't really sure what to do. She glanced over at the TV and saw that the 12 o'clock news was on… Peter would be home soon. He had a Job teaching kids how to play tennis and Lizzie had never seen him happier in all his life. The smile that she had first seen on Peter's face when the Chair Umpire called out across the stadium: Game, set and match, Colt at the final of Wimbledon, had been firmly in place ever since… He had a break for lunch at noon, the heat of the day. Without fail he came back to their apartment, to either pick Lizzie up and go out for lunch or to have a quiet and private lunch at home… Which left room for some Mr. and Mrs. Colt time… Peter would be back any minute and she wasn't even sure what she would say yet… What words she would use to tell him and she dreaded his reaction… Just as she had expected she heard the door open and a call of \"Hey, Lizzie!\" in greeting. She took a deep breath and stood up from the sofa and walked into the main hall to see Peter, dumping a load of bags in the corner beside the coat rack. She had to admit, that their apartment was beautiful. The hall was done in light cream and had a rich feeling to it, which she loved. There were tasteful paintings hung on the wall and a mirror on the left hand side as you came in; good Feng Shui. He beamed as soon as his eyes fell on her and soon she found herself swept up in her husband's arms. She kissed him eagerly; even her neurosis couldn't keep her away from Peter's lips for long… When she was in his arms the rest of the world fell away. Peter felt exactly the same, as much as he may love his job, his favourite part of the day was when he could come home… Lizzie, of course, still played professional tennis and since his great win, she had won Wimbledon herself (twice) and the US Open. Soon, it would be time to travel back to England for this years Wimbledon… let's hope her good luck still held. Every so often, Lizzie came to work with Peter and helped out. It was then she realised why he loved his job so much… All the kids were wonderful and surprisingly eager to learn. It was a rewarding experience to see the progress that they make. When the two eventually parted, Lizzie smiled up at him and then gave him a look that told him everything. It wasn't intentional, but over the last year, Peter had gotten to know Lizzie, very, very well and he knew when she was holding back. \"What's wrong?\" he asked holding her at arms length and tipping his head slightly. He didn't sound concerned but curious instead. Lizzie shook her head and smiled. She looked back into his eyes and grabbed his hand. She made her way into the living room with Peter in tow and she pulled him in front of the sofa. He raised one eyebrow and stood expectantly. \"Well?\" he asked with a smirk… Another reason why she liked him, somehow he always managed to lighten the mood. She put her hands on his chest and pushed him backwards so he fell onto the sofa. She laughed. \"You might wanna sit down…\" \"I didn't have any choice!\" he complained jokingly. She laughed again and crawled on top of him, straddling his hips. \"I like it already…\" Peter commented. She shook her head and looked him straight in the eyes… \"I'm pregnant.\" She watched the changing emotions. Surprise. Disbelief. Worry. Shock. And then the one she had been hoping would surface to triumph at the end… (Drum roll please…………..) Happiness. He beamed at her again, he looked like he was about to explode in happiness, he stuttered and stumbled over words and then gave up. He settled for jumping up, grabbing her and spinning her around in the air. They both laughed. This went on for quite a while, kissing and ensued, quickly followed by all-out snogging. When finally the initial glee had worn off he set back on the ground again. \"You're going be a daddy!\" Lizzie laughed at the shocked look still on his features… \" You're going to be a mummy!\" he said pointing an accusing finger with wide eyes and looking down at her stomach. They both laughed and Lizzie pulled him into a kiss again. \"I'm so glad that you're pleased.\" He looked at her, disbelief etched on his features. \"What the hell else could I be!\" he laughed, pulling her into a bear hug. \"Wh- when did you find out?\" he asked, still hugging her. \"Five minutes ago,\" she said with a sigh as they finally parted. \"Jesus… Have you told your Dad?\" he asked, almost as an after thought. She shook her head, still smiling, ignoring the pain in her face at the muscles getting an extra long work out… \"I never got time, you arrived when I finally got shaken from my stupor. And in those five minutes I've made an important choice… I'm going to miss a year of Wimbledon. My family's more important than my career.\" He smiled at her. She looked straight back at him and saw his smile turn to a look of thought as his eyes rolled left and up. \"I wonder if I can get the rest of the day off?\" he said. He soon had made his way over to the phone and was calling the club. Lizzie sat down on the sofa, wondering why she had ever doubted that Peter would be happy. She expected that it was just one of those natural worries that a mother has. Having sad that, if he had been angry, she would have been disappointed and she would have known right then and there that Peter was not the man for her… Then she remembered something that had deserted her memory during her neurosis… A memory, she thought back: \" Do you like children?\" \"I would like to just repetitively make children and practice making children in between. Babies are marvelous. Babies are where it's at. That's why you've got to keep having them -- so you've always got one that's not at the 'I hate you, Dad' stage. I'm entirely dogmatic about this.\" She laughed at the thought… Yup, she had definitely chosen the right guy. + Three days later \"ON MY GOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE GONNA BE A FATHER! MY SON! MY VERY FIRST GRANDCHILD!\" The rant continued on for a while until Augusta calmed down. (A/N: Now… as far as I can remember, and I have just watched my Wimbledon DVD… You never actually hear Peter's Father's name… so I'm going to go with the name of the actor, k?) Bernard, Peter's father then took his turn in quietly congratulating him while Augusta moved on to Lizzie… The dinner that night was a bright and breezy one. Everyone was ecstatic and Carl had given up on Lizzie and was now engaged to Sonya… the girl from the bookies. \"Daddy?\" \"Yeah, Emaly,\" Peter answered. \"Can you help me with my backhand? I keep hitting it out…\" Emaly, Peter's 7-year-old daughter asked him. \"Can you give me two seconds and I'll be right there,\" Peter replied trying to dislodge his 3-year-old from his leg. \"Do you… need a hand?\" Lizzie asked, returning from collecting the scattered balls from around the court. \"Come on, Stellan, Daddy's got to help Emaly…\" Stellan just giggled inanely. \"Nope, I'm good Hun,\" he said, his voice strained trying to pry Stellan from his limb. \"Daddy! Hurry up!\" \"Coming!\" he shouted back. Lizzie soon came to Peter's rescue, getting Stellan off his leg with little effort and few soft words. \"Thank you, dear,\" Peter said, with a pant and straightening. \"You're welcome… Hun,\" she said, stealing a kiss on her way by. Peter smiled stupidly in accomplishment. \"DAD!\" \"Sorry…\" Lizzie watched as the love of her life instructed her beautiful daughter how to improve her backhand and as she bounced Stellan on her knee… she realised that she was for once… completely content… Fin I really hope that you liked that… Please review… I wrote it for you!

It faded just behind the great castle, the one that was just a little ways away from the rest of the neat square houses. The mansion stood dark and ancient, full of secrets and out of place amongst the cheery brick houses with neatly kept lawns. No wonder the town's kids were so drawn to the mysterious house and that they spent hours poking around the place much to the displeasure of their parents. They didn't care though, they wanted to lure out the infamous recluse it was rumored lived there. Maestro or The Maestro they believed he was called. Occasionally he did appear and put on little shows for the children, but if he didn't want to be found they could not find him. And so it was that one of the local kids, a boy named Timothy Shellon wandered down the yard of the mansion and past the huge iron gates that swung open before him with a great creak. The mansion seemed bigger than ever looming above him like some prehistoric creature. 'I'm not scared' Timothy thought defiantly, walking slowly up to the ragged stone staircase that led to the front door. Was it just him or did the air get colder with every step he took closer to the great double doors? Timothy pressed his face against a window that was covered in grime, making it nearly impossible to see inside of the dim house. He thought he could just make out a winding staircase and that was all. Suddenly a flurry of movement caught his attention, something flashed by the foot of the stairs. Something blue. Startled Timothy gasped and staggered backwards, he felt as if people were crowding all around him, pushing and shoving. Touching his face, his clothes, his hair with icy fingers. \"Get off! Get off of me, Get away!\" he screamed into empty air, pushing back. Through the silence came a swell of voices whispering all around him- \" Stop this…Leave him….Maestro…He won't be pleased…\" then everything stopped. The voices died away and so did the prodding of invisible hands. The house no longer seemed vacant; more like unseen residents were watching him. Timothy backed off the porch, staring about him wildly, nothing. The boy's earlier panic was replaced by anger, what kind of trick was that! Timothy kneeled down and picked up a good sized rock from the ground, his skinny arm flailing as he tossed it at the house. The rock smashed into the solid wooden door with a resounding boom that echoed all around. Timothy smiled and leaned down to pick up another rock \"I'm not scared of you!\" he yelled \"You ghosts or whatever you are. And I'm not scared of this dusty old house either.\" The second rock went straight through a window. Glass shattered and rained down, some pieces catching the fading sunlight and glittering brightly. The boy smiled as he beheld his work, satisfied. \"You know that's not very nice.\" A voice, spoken quietly came from just behind him. Timothy flinched, but he didn't turn around because he wasn't afraid. Nope. \"Oh yeah? Well who are you to think that I care?\" At first there was a silence as if the person was pondering this. \"Did I say that you cared? even though you should for destroying someone's property.\" Timothy smirked \"Look at this house. It's a rotting piece of crap filled with dust and termites, it's already been destroyed.\" At this he went to scoop up another rock but something grabbed his shoulder before he could, it gripped him so hard he winced and knew that he would bruise. \"Let go of me!\" a tremor crept into his tone, trying to put up a tough front he added \"Right now or…or-\" A roll of metallic laughter shrieked into his ear. \"Or what? Empty threats, little Timothy. Who are you to think that I care?\" a darker tone had crept into the voice as it mocked him. A chill ran down his spine as the voice spoke his name, the boy squirmed trying to break away from the iron grip. More laughter. \"I think they'll like you, Timothy. For your sake they'd better.\" Timothy was wrenched around to face the owner of the voice, and his eyes widened in pure terror. He opened his mouth as if to scream, but before he could make the sound it died on his lips. Twilight fell over Normal Valley.[Chapter 2] Chapter One Mayor Warren leaned back into his office chair, sliding his glasses further up his nose and frowning as he looked over one sheet of many files of paperwork piled up on his desk. Taxes for the city, complaints and requests from many of its residents. As much as the man loved his job, he had to admit this was not one of its perks. A slight tap on his door made him look up and Mayor Warren straightened, pulling at the edges of his crisp suit and smoothing it down to make sure it was free of any wrinkles. Although he set his face into a deep scowl, annoyed at being interrupted secretly he was relieved to have an excuse to leave the paperwork alone from the moment. \"Come in.\" He said gruffly. Terra, his receptionist eased inside of the office her nervousness plastered all over her face. The mayor fixed the young woman with a hawk-eyed stare \"I told you I didn't want to be interrupted for the next hour or two.\" Automatically a dismayed look spread across the receptionist's face, every employee of his all were terrified of him. \"I…I know sir, but-\" \"No 'Buts' \" Warren barked \"My order was my order and being that I am the mayor of Normal Valley and your employer I expect them to be obeyed when I give them, Is that clear?\" Terra blushed and bowed her head \"It is, Mayor Warren… but there is a situation and…and\" she stammered and trailed off, seeing the look on the Mayors face. Didn't he just make it clear several hours earlier that he did not want to be disturbed? And yet here she was and she didn't look like she was leaving yet. Suddenly he remembered something \"Terra where's my coffee?\" Terra was caught off guard by that \"…Sir?\" the Mayor sighed \"My coffee. The coffee that I asked you to bring me over an hour ago. Is it really this difficult for you to follow simple orders?\" The receptionist flinched at the biting note in the Mayors voice, \"I'm sorry!\" she gasped \"Really, really sorry. I forgot let me go get it for you now.\" She turned and made her way to the door, more than relieved to escape from her pushy, oversized boss. Mayor Warren narrowed his eyes and spoke in a acid tone \"Stop. I didn't tell you to go anywhere. Now, I'm assuming you came in here when I told you not to for a reason, hopefully other than to showcase your incompetence. What was that reason.\" His beady eyes bore down on his assistant \"And for your sake it better be worth my time.\" Terra, flushed and at the same time infuriated by Warren's cold treatment of her clenched her jaw and took a moment to compose herself before turning around to face him, struggling not to show how shattered her nerves were at that moment. \"Oh yes. A few of the members of your Neighborhood Watch want to speak with you, sir.\" Mayor Warren perked up just a bit with interest. That was a program he had decided to keep up with so he knew what was going on at all times in his town. Anything shady or suspicious seen by them, was reported straight to him so he could take care of it. But not much went on in this town which was a fact Mayor Warren took pride in. But with every city there was that one flaw, that one imperfection, that one problem that could throw everything he worked for off balance. And that was something he would not stand for. \"Oh. And what is it that they want to talk about?\" he asked slowly, careful not to reveal how eager he was to find out. Terra shook her head \"I don't know. But they're pretty riled up; do you want me to send them to you?\" Warren nodded and flicked his hand towards the door \"Yes. And after you do that get me my coffee but don't come back in here until I call for you.\" Terra turned and quickly left the room returning a few minutes later with a large crowd of visitors. Linda Crisfield, the head of the Neighborhood watch bustled into the room, her skirts switching about her meaty legs. \"Mayor Warren!\" she shouted in her overly loud voice rushing right up to his desk. The Mayor leaned away from her subtly giving her a slight nod \"Mrs. Crisfield. You wanted to speak to me, what about?\" Linda pursed her lips \"What about, what about? You mean you haven't heard what's been going on around here lately?\" her crowd of followers, mainly other women and, Warren noticed with some surprise a few kids. He frowned up at Linda, annoyed by the way she was addressing him, without the slightest bit of regard of his position. Everyone here were almost afraid to raise their voices over a whisper when they spoke to him yet here she was leaning over his desk and practically screaming in his ear. An edge crept into the Mayors voice \"No, Mrs. Crisfield. But I'd like to know once you take the time to tell me.\" Linda went on like she didn't catch what he said or maybe she just didn't care. \"Our children have been having these…dreams. Or these nightmares I guess you can call them. It all started for me with my little Roger, but I didn't think much of it of course, children do have wild imaginations.\" She trailed off and glanced over her shoulder at the group then went on \"But, talking to the other moms I found of that all of their kids have been having the same dreams too!\" Mayor Warren scowled; he was not wasting his time to hear this ridiculous gossip. What did they expect him to do about some dreams? \"All of you must be giving your kids too much sugar before bed. Mrs. Crisfield I am a very busy man and I have more important things to do than listen to you tell me campfire tales.\" He didn't bother to disguise the scorn in his voice and a surprised look came across Linda's face. Behind her the group of Neighborhood Watcher's muttered amongst themselves until a voice spoke up \"But Mayor Warren! You don't understand. What these kids are saying, it's scary. No, it's more than that it's downright disturbing! Oh you should hear the things they tell us about!\" A thin woman with waist length black hair took a timid step forward \"She's right. The things they say, it's insane! It's not normal. It's almost like the things he does.\" She shuddered as she said the last part of that sentence, like she felt a chill. At once the others nodded their heads and exchanged horrified looks it was like him. Linda was back into control and she gave her agreement. \"Lucille's right. And you know how those kids love to go hanging around that creepers mansion at all times of the day.\" More voices spoke up, tainted with a bit of anger. \"That's right!\" \"I don't allow my child to go anywhere near that place.\" Mayor Warren placed his hands on his desk, watching the people ranting on in front of him. \"You're all speaking about that one, the man that lives in the mansion. You're saying that you think he's responsible for what's happening?\" his beady eyes shone with a fierce light, it was no secret that he harbored a strong dislike for that man. Maybe people just didn't know how deep it ran. Linda nodded her assent again \"Who else! No one other than that freak would cause something like this. He can't be mentally sane you know, he must be doing this as some sort of sick trick, to get revenge on us. He's not safe to have around us, and our children.\" Yet another woman spoke up from the group \"You all heard what happened to Anna's kid, Timothy when he went poking around that house.\" Suddenly everyone quieted down and looked at each other. Mayor Warren stared curiously at the lady who spoke \"I didn't hear about this. What happened?\" he wasn't pleased that he had to ask when everyone else already knew what was going on. He was the mayor, he should know before anyone else. The lady ran her hands along her jeans and looked down sheepishly, having the attention on her now \"Ah..well, Timothy was out messing around with some of his friends. They dared him to go up to the house and knock on the door so he did, and he didn't come back. They saw him go up the path to the house but they didn't go with him.\" The Mayor nodded, processing all of this. \"So he's missing.\" It wasn't a question. After a few more moments of silence he looked up, a smirk twitching across the corner of his mouth \"Tomorrow I want you all to come back here. We're going to have a discussion and then…we'll be paying this circus show runaway a visit.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter Two Authors Note: First off I'd just like to thank all of my readers, the ones who have taken the time to leave a review and maybe some who have not. I know it's been a long wait for this update and truthfully I'm not content with this chapter, It seems weak to me. So, you all finally get to meet Maestro, and I can promise from this point on you'll be seeing a lot of him, as well as a new character who will play a big role in this story. I lost my muse for this story for awhile and that's why I haven't updated in such a long time. I'll try to get my muse back, and start updating more often as well. So, leave a review and tell me what you think of this chapter, do you think it should have been better, or could be approved? Thanks for reading and Lots of Love! ~WhATiSUnImAgInEd~ The next day as promised The Mayor was leading his circle of followers up to snaking path that led to Someplace Else as it was uniquely called. Linda was there of course with all of her fellow Neighborhood Watch members at her heels like obedient puppies. Not everyone in Normal Valley approved of Mayor Warren's plans on disturbing Maestro yet again and so the group was a little smaller than it had been the first time. That didn't deter Warren as he marched up the hill burning up in the fancy dark suit that he had decided to wear as the noonday sun beamed down on them. \"Mayor, are you alright?\" That was Linda the woman hurried forward until she was walking beside him and she placed a hand on his shoulder which he proceeded to shrug off rudely \"I'm fine, Why?\" Linda gave a small shrug then answered \"You're sound like you're hyperventilating. And you're red.\" Mayor Warren scowled deeply, and it didn't help that he heard a few chuckles from the people behind him. \"I'm fine. It's just this hill is steep. And this is a long walk, you know.\" \"Oh! Well I brought along some ham sandwiches. If you want we can stop for a break and have so-\" \"No!\" Warren snapped \"I don't need a break. I'm fine. We need to keep going.\" Linda stepped back with an offended look on her face but the Mayor ignored her and kept going. Finally the great house rolled into view, unchanged as ever by time or space. The group fell into a hushed silence as they walked into the yard and towards the front door of the house, tension thick in the air. The Mayor turned to face them for the first time, seeing identical expressions of apprehension on each persons face. Apparently now that they were actually here, in the Maestro's domain all that talk from yesterday had disappeared. \"Alright listen\" he began \"No matter what tricks he pulls stay together. And don't let him get to you.\" Mayor Warren turned and stepped up moving towards the front door, glancing down as something crunched underneath his shoes. Glass… Warren reached out and grabbed the handle of the door, the heavy wood creaking as it swung open. Inside a gust of cool air hit him dead in the face, much cooler than it was outside. Behind him there were a few murmurings as he stepped into the house, glancing over his shoulder to make sure that he was being followed. The house was just as he remembered it to be, dark and silent with everything covered in a film of dust. But not empty, the very air seemed to hum with energy as if people were all around him. Hostile eyes stared the Mayor and his company down from unseen places. \"Maybe he's not here.\" someone whispered from just behind him. Mayor Warren shook his head \"He's here.\" He knew he was here somewhere just lurking about, probably trying to scare them again. \"Come out!\" Mayor shouted \"We don't have time for your little tricks. We know what you've been doing and we came to stop you.\" At that moment a steady thump sounded from somewhere upstairs and everyone soon recognized that sound as footsteps. Coming straight towards them. Behind the Mayor the others clumped closer together and someone gasped quietly. \"And what have I done?\" A voice asked quietly as the Maestro made his way to the foot of the stairs, halting right in front of Mayor Warren. Warren unconsciously took a step back, obviously remembering his last run in with him. \"Don't play stupid with us.\" He stated gruffly drawing his overzealous figure up as straight as he could. \"The last place a boy from this town was seen was coming up here, to your house. He went missing right after that. Now, would you care to explain?\" A thoughtful look crossed Maestro's face and he started to pace back in forth in front of the mob. \"But I haven't seen anyone here.\" \"Like we're going to believe that.\" A voice sneered from somewhere behind Warren \"I think everyone knows how you like to fool around up here in this house. Our children come up here all the time. You and Mayor Warren have never seen eye to eye on anything. If you had something against us, kidnapping one of our kids would be the perfect revenge, right?\" Mayor Warren smiled grimly as a series of other protests rose up from his citizens. \"I bet you can see that we don't believe you. So, where is the kid or will we have to search for him ourselves.\" A dark look crossed over the Maestro's features. \"No matter what you might think of me, I told you I don't know what you're talking about.\" He glared at Mayor Warren and added dangerously \"If I had a 'disagreement' I'd be direct about it, not take it out on some child.\" Mayor Warren tried unsuccessfully to met the Maestro's stare but couldn't, instead he looked across the dark mansion. \"Move out of my way.\" He barked \"We know he's in here, we'll find him.\" Suddenly the feeling of others crowding around the room was overpowering, a breeze picked up, stirring around everyone gathered there. It sounded like a clamor of voices, whispering something inaudible that was quickly swelling in volume. Behind the Mayor Linda gasped sharply, \"What is that?\" A strange smile crept across the Maestro's face \"It's the ghosts.\" He said lowly, \"You do remember them, don't you?\" Mayor Warren scowled, he could feel the resistance of his followers dying down, being replaced by nervousness. \"Tricks!\" he shouted to them, the voices were getting ever louder. \"He's trying to drive us off.\" Maestro shook his head. \"It's not me, it's them. They don't want you to be here. I, however don't mind guests, no matter how rude they may be.\" There was something almost playful about his tone. \"If you want to search through the house, go ahead. I can't say that they will allow it though.\" At this the din picked up until it was roar, drowning out everything else. In fact it seemed like the very foundation of the house was shaking, Mayor Warren staggered back a couple of steps, as did his group. They were being pushed, literally out of the door of the house. Maestro raised an eyebrow and smiled \"I guess they're not in the mood for company today.\" He said innocently with a shrug. Mayor Warren growled, trying to hide the fact that he was truly terrified of the ghosts. \"I don't know what you're playing at, but I plan on finding out. We know that you are the one behind all of this. Who else would it be but the towns outcast, This time you're going too far with your games. Do you hear me, fre-\" At that moment the door slammed closed, shutting Mayor Warren and his companions outside. But the mayor was far from being done, no, he was only beginning.[Chapter 4] Chapter Three The moment the door closed Maestro sighed and leaned back against the wall, \"You know that this won't always work right?\" he spoke aloud. The roar had died down now until it was nonexistent and pale blue figures started to appear around the Maestro looking at him expectantly. \"It worked this time.\" One ghost, Winsor pointed out. \"But it won't always, that's the point.\" \"You think they would have learned by now\" Nerilla muttered, studying her nails with an indifferent expression. \"I want them to come back!\" That was Prinz, perhaps the most mischievous out of the group. \"Why?\" \"Because it's fun!\" Prinz yelled \"There's never anything to do here.\" Nerilla scowled at him \"It's not fun to be woken up from your beauty rest by a bunch of people tramping around over your head!\" \"Rest? We're always resting. We are dead .\" Someone else grunted. Nerilla rolled her eyes and decided to ignore that outburst, Prinz meanwhile glared at her. \"It is fun!\" \"Is not!\" \"Is!\" \"Is not.\" Prinz threw his hands up in the air in exasperation \"Okay, do you know what you're problem is? Even when we were alive you had to go spoiling things for me, and I-\" Nerilla scoffed \"Old habits die hard.\" Prinz muttered something under his breath and before Maestro could stop them the pair slammed into each other and floated off the floor, spiraling up and through the ceiling, their voices fading as they vanished to a higher level of the house. Maestro shook his head and placed his hand to his temple \"Okay. What I was trying to say is, the town's mayor is stubborn. Eventually he'll be determined to get to me, ghosts or no.\" The ghosts all glanced at each other, some looked worried and the others looked doubtful. \"No, that wouldn't happen. He's too afraid of us.\" Someone objected, met by murmurs of agreement. Maestro shrugged, no matter what they said he couldn't shake the feeling that, that may be what would happen. And then what when they couldn't scare Mayor Warren away? \"That's just the way I see it.\" Suddenly something dawned on him, \"The boy!\" All of the ghosts present rewarded that outburst with a blank stare. \"What?\" they chided in unison. Maestro raised his gaze up to all of them, watching them carefully. \"Remember that Warren was talking about some kid gone missing up here, Timothy. If we found him we could just take him back home, he's probably just hiding out here somewhere.\" His voice was becoming sharp with his enthusiasm. If they found Timothy safe then there wouldn't be anymore problems with Mayor Warren. The ghosts were silent, exchanging somber looks at each other, and then back to him, and he knew that this couldn't be good. \"You saw what happened, right?\" Maestro asked, a little uncertain now. A visible ripple passed through his \"family\" and Winsor came forward, a troubled look in his eyes. \"The thing is…\" He began and inwardly Maestro groaned he could tell when ever something serious had happened because it was always Win who told him the news, he seemed to be the chosen representative among the ghosts. And he always began it the same way ' Well Maestro, you see the thing is…' The Maestro looked up at Winsor who was tugging nervously at the buttons on his old frock coat. \"The thing is what, Win?\" he prompted him quietly. Winsor sighed and glanced over his shoulder at the others who were watching him with in the same expecting way Maestro was. He sighed again, longer this time and began to speak \"You weren't there when it happened Maestro, but do you remember what you told us that day? Scare off whoever came up to the house.\" Maestro nodded slowly, he remembered giving Win that order to communicate with the others. \"We did what you said to do.\" Winsor continued still twiddling with the buttons on his coat \"And Timothy started to run off. But then, from what we could see he stopped and started speaking with this…this thing. \" Win paused and a visible tremor ran down his solid form, causing him to become translucent for a few moments before he regained control of himself. Maestro narrowed his eyes \"Who was it?\" Winsor shook his head \"That's the thing. You should have felt the energy it was giving off. There's no way that it's purely human.\" Maestro shifted, Inhuman? \" Are you sure?\" he asked fighting down the unease that was starting to rise up. Winsor nodded \"It seemed that way. And it took, it took that boy. It took Timothy.\" ( I hope you liked the update. And I hope you liked the little scene with Nerilla and Prinz. The funny thing about them is that originally I planned their names to be something else but now I'm gonna stick with those. Ah, so we're getting our first mention of the mysterious villan in the story for the first time since the preview. What happens next? Maybe you guys could help me with that, what do you wanna see happen. I already have most of this planned out but it always helps to hear a few ideas. Anyway thanks so much for reading, and please leave a review! ^^ )[Chapter 5] Chapter Five (A/N: A longer update for you guys for making you wait! I've been busy because of school, but I'm about to be out for the summer school and that means more time for writing! As always, I adore getting feedback and hearing your thoughts on the story and theories. :) ) The Maestro barely left his home back at Someplace Else. Or to put it another way he barely left the house when people were still out running errands, saved him a lot of trouble that way. Now was he walked steadily down the sidewalk past brightly lit stores he was aware of the disbelieving stares and whispered statements that followed him. \"Looks like the neighborhoods' favorite eccentric is out for a walk, wait till Warren hears about this.\" A burst of hushed laughter followed that comment; Maestro clenched his jaw and walked on, pretending not to hear. \"Pay them no mind, sir\" Winsor appeared beside him, his soundless step matching Maestros perfectly. \"They wonder why I don't pay them neighborly visits\" Maestro muttered discontentedly skirting to the side a little as a pair of women, their arms heavy with bags nervously edged around him, one of them passing right through Win without seeing him. Win shivered and paused for a moment an odd look crossing his face, Maestro frowned \"Problem?\" Win shook his head \"I absolutely hate when people do that. You'd have to be a ghost to understand it.\" Maestro only smirked though the expression didn't last long before it was replaced by one of thoughtfulness. \"Are you sure that I should do this?\" his voice was touched with uncertainty as he looked over at Winsor. Win nodded vigorously \"Of course. Who would be better at telling you what you need to know about Timothy than his own mother? If we're going to find him we'll need all the information we can get.\" He had to admit that Win had a point. But the fact that she's his mother is what's got me worried. However Maestro didn't voice his doubts, he just continued to walk on. Beside him Win came to a halt \"I can't go any further than this\" he announced giving Maestro a regretful glance. He understood. Ghosts were connected, or linked to the place that had the most influence on them in life. In all of his families' case that connection was the big mansion that they lived in. \"Thanks Win\" He said quietly, grateful that Win had come to keep him company. Win gave a small smile before he vanished, and Maestro could feel his presence slip away. Shoving his hands into his pockets Maestro went on his way, eventually coming to a halt in front of a small house. This is it he exhaled loudly then walked up to the front door, and knocked quietly twice. There was no sound behind the door and the blinds were pulled shut. A cool breeze caused the tree leaves to rustle, and the crickets paused in their melody. After what seemed like an eternity the door swung open revealing a tired looking woman, her hair was in a mess around her face and her eyes were dark and sad. \"Yes, Can I help yo-\" she broke off when she realized who Maestro was. \"I want you gone!\" she yelled suddenly coming alive in her fury \"You're the one whose house my son went to!\" her tone was sharp and accusatory and growing louder by the second. The Maestro backed up a little, glancing around nervously \"Mrs. Shellon, please let me explain. I came here to talk to you about Timothy-\" She didn't want to hear a word, \"What did you do to him? Where is he?\" she demanded. Maestro sighed in exasperation \"I've told the mayor and now I'm telling you. I-don't-have-him\" She didn't respond, only glared at him silently. Just then a little girl walked up and peered around Mrs. Shellon at Maestro. She looked to be about eight or nine years old, with a halo of untamed, dark curls around her face. \"Mama\" she said tugging at Mrs. Shellons hand to get her attention, Mrs. Shellon looked down at her daughter \"Shouldn't you be in bed, Blue?\" The girl, apparently named Blue shook her head and continued her inspection of The Maestro, her eyes were big and dark and full of intelligence \"I couldn't sleep…Who's this?\" Mrs. Shellon frowned up at Maestro, who was smiling but wiped the expression away as soon as he knew she was looking at him. She nudged Blue further away from him \"Nobody.\" She turned her attention back to Maestro, her eyes hardening \"I don't know what you're playing at but I don't want to see you near my home or kids again, Good-bye.\" The door slammed shut and Maestro sighed \"That went well.\" And as he turned he realized that all of Mrs. Shellons screaming had drawn several of the neighbors out onto their porches. Wonderful. He frowned and quickly walked down the lawn, back towards his home but before he got far a shout of \"Hey!\" stopped him. The Maestro pivoted just in time to see a small shape rushing around the side of the house; it was the girl he saw inside with Timothy's mother. She halted a few paces away from him, watching him carefully. They stood like this for a moment until she spoke \"You're the guy from that big house.\" Maestro couldn't help but to smile \"Yes, and you've been told about me already, huh?\" She nodded \"They say that since Timothy disappeared up by your house you had something to do with it. But I don't believe them. You don't seem like the kind of person who'd do that.\" Blue walked around him, staring up at the nighttime sky and Maestro watched her silently, wishing that Warren and the rest of the town had the same sense that she did. Suddenly she turned on him, her eyes flashing \"Are you real?\" Maestro started, taken off guard by the question \"Of course I'm real. What made you ask that?\" Blue shrugged, staring down at the ground now instead of at him \"The stories that they tell about you, Nobody. It makes you seem like something out of a book instead of an actual person.\" \"But you never believed those stories?\" Maestro mused, his attention fixed on this curious child. \"Nope. They were kind of fun to listen too though.\" Blue finally looked up at him, and she frowned a bit \"Is it true that you stay up there with a bunch of ghosts?\" Maestro laughed, thinking about his unique family of phantoms \"It's true.\" He explained \"But they're not how you would think them to be.\" Blue smiled for a moment \"Oh. But you don't know where my brother is?\" \"No, I wish I did. That's what I'm trying to find out.\" Blue peered straight up into his face, her expression so somber that it seemed unfitting for someone as young as she. \"We need to find him.\" She said gravely \"He may have been a pain, as a big brother but we've got to find him. Mommy's so sad without him. She's worried about him, I miss him. He's in trouble, Nobody can't you tell?\" The Maestro could hear the sadness coloring Blue's every word but before he could respond she went on. \"And why aren't they helping you look for him? Instead of accusing you?\" Maestro could only shake his head \"Because they don't like me, Blue.\" Blue's frown deepened \"That's stupid! If they won't help then you and I will have to find Timothy ourselves.\" He leaned back, \"You and I?\" Maestro repeated doubtfully looking down at Blue \"I don't know if you should-\" The girl's expression changed to one of pure determination \"He's my brother, I'll help you look for him since they won't. And maybe we can talk with Mayor Warren and get him to help.\" At that moment a yell saved Maestro from saying another word, Mrs. Shellon had come out looking for her daughter. Maestro backed up, hoping she wouldn't spot him, he didn't think that would end well for him. Blue glanced over at her mother, than back at the Maestro, the determined light still shining in her eyes even as she smiled \"Bye Nobody.\" She whispered before taking off back towards the house. The Maestro watched until the pair had both vanished back inside the house, and he could hear Mrs. Shellon chastising Blue for running off before the door closed. He didn't notice the figure standing barely 3 feet away from him nearly invisible in the gloom of the night. And he didn't turn in time enough to witness the creature turning sharply, with a small hiss and starting off towards the town.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six Aside from meeting Blue, that trip was absolutely pointless. So thought Maestro as he trudged back down the same path he had just walked only ten or so minutes ago. It was true, he felt like he had come no closer to finding anything out about Timothy or where he could be. On the other hand, Timothy's sister seemed dead set on helping him I don't know if that's good or bad . He had no idea what he was bringing himself into. A sudden chill ran down The Maestro's spine, causing him to halt. For the first time he became aware of the deep silence that surrounded him, there was nothing no crickets, cicadas, anything. The air seemed heavy with the silence as well as underplayed with something more sinister. Maestro gave himself a shake, trying to smooth away the odd feeling and without much success. Just keep walking He told himself grimly taking another slow step forward, but now the clipped sound of his shoes hitting the pavement seemed overly loud… amplified through the quiet. A presence seemed to be looming around him, giving the air a taint of bitterness. Okay, this was enough, something was wrong here and he would be dumb to try and turn a blind eye. The Maestro pulled his hands out of his pockets scanning the darkness carefully only to be met with the same thing as before, darkness. He was just as blind in this unnatural gloom as anyone else would be, he needed the magic. \"Win\" Maestro whispered; wishing now more than ever that his ghostly companion was with him, he would know what was going on. In the next moments he didn't have time to register what happened, one moment he was standing and reaching out for the magic, the next something smashed into him knocking the breath from his lungs and sending him down onto the cold ground. \"It's quite…interesting to meet you at last, Maestro.\" A voice, deceptively soft spoke from someplace directly to the right of him, but far enough away so that they were hidden by the dark. Automatically, The Maestro tried to turn his head in that direction, struggling to see but something seemed to slam him back against the ground. A paralysis trickled over his limbs, like ice cold water. It felt like invisible chains were winding around him, causing him to wince at the bruising pressure against his skin. \"Settle down, I only want to talk.\" The voice spoke again, just as soothing as sour milk. A bolt of anger shot through The Maestro \"It's kind of hard to do that when you're being held against your will!\" The only response he got was another painful squeeze that made him lose his breath. \"You and I both know that you could get up when you so choose. I've heard of your…talents.\" Yeah, and they aren't exactly getting me anywhere right now, are they? \"That's nice.\" The voice went on, ignoring him. \"I also heard that you're trying to clean up your reputation as the towns eccentric and become the hero instead. Except I can't see that ridiculous Mayor or anyone here for that matter, wanting your help.\" Each word was spoken carefully, slowly, and with a sting that Maestro definitely felt. \"That has nothing to do with you\" he retorted, trying to get to his feet without much result. \"Be still!\" It hissed and the 'chains' clamped down more around him, pushing against his chest and ribs with a crushing force, The Maestro let out a small gasp of pain. That dead silence came back for a few minutes until…\"I'm afraid it has everything to do with me.\" It sounded cold, furious and another jolt of pain travelled down his spine. \"And Maestro, it would be best if you stayed out of my way.\" Whatever was holding him down; and he had a sneaking suspicion that It was using magic to do so, grew tighter around him, burning ice-cold against his skin. The feeling travelled all over and the breath was literally being squeezed out of him. Desperate he reached for the link that he shared with his family, sending out a frantic plea, he needed them. Right. Now. A swarm of voices sounded off in his mind, faint but made sharper by alarm. ' Maestro?' ' What's going on? ' Are you okay?' ' Of course he's not okay you idiot!' ' Stop fighting, you two schmucks!' ' Do something, quick!' They were talking over each other, clumsy in their fear like newborn puppies. 'Maestro' one voice rose above the others, struggling to be calm in the midst of all the turmoil. 'Winsor!' he recognized him at once. ' We'll be there, but fight, you know how and be quick!' Win urged him. The Maestro would have nodded but he was still pinned in place. And he couldn't breathe, his body was burning for air. ' Quickly ' Win reminded him. The Maestro closed his eyes, imagining the pressure being lifted off of him, forcing the 'chains' away. A rush of furious, bright energy coursed through him. Maestro's eyes snapped open; they burned blue, piercing and cold instead of his usual warm dark brown. He forced the opposing energy back, air returning to his lungs as the invisible bonds were broken. The Maestro sat up, gasping but instead of relief he felt an endless, churning anger. The gloom was no lighter, but some instinct caused Maestro to look to his right, exactly were its voice had been coming from. A pair of sharp green eyes glowed from the darkness, staring right at him. That was no exaggeration they literally glowed, an unnatural sickly shade of green that made his stomach lurch. But he met that stare unwaveringly, feeling his anger growing. \"Who are you?\" he demanded, rising to his feet in one fluid motion ready to charge in the direction he thought it was standing. There was no answer, the eyes just blinked slowly, and the dark presence amplified before it vanished. He was alone. The Maestro hissed between his teeth, agitation growing. In response the cool blue energy pulsed more fiercely until the air around him seemed to crackle. A flash of blue cut through the darkness and Maestro spun around, ready to lash out with his magic. \"Maestro! What happened?\" It was Win, barely more than a pale outline but still he practically radiated his concern. The others must not have had enough power to get this far. \"Are you alright?\" Win tried again, after not getting anything out of Maestro but a blank stare. The Maestro gave his head a small shake, and started pacing back and forth in front of Win, not knowing what else to do with all the agitated energy bottled up inside of him. This is insane. Maestro looked around, his gaze passing over Win like he wasn't there. \" Maestro \" Win said again sharply and this time Maestro's gaze snapped up to him, a distracted look in his eyes. \"It's only me, calm down.\" For a second, the frosty blue stare didn't waver then Maestro sighed and his shoulders slumped, the blue faded from his eyes. Win let out a small sigh as well taking a few steps closer. \"Don't let it do that again.\" The Maestro only nodded \"I know.' The less control he had over his temper, the less of a hold he had on his magic…and himself. Suddenly he became aware of the heaviness that seemed to weigh at his feet, and the soreness all over which no doubt came from being slammed into the ground and then nearly crushed by someone, or something's dark tricks. \"So what happened?\" Win broke the silence that rose between them. \"It attacked me.\" Maestro answered simply, swaying a little. \"And what is 'It', exactly?\" Win questioned patiently. Suddenly something clicked in Maestro's head \"The It! The same one you all said took Timmy away.\" He remembered what it had said 'It has everything to do with me.' Win regarded him warily, \"Are you sure? Did you see it?\" The Maestro shot him a disbelieving look, \"It's to dark out here to see anything! But it practically confessed. And this is Normal Valley, Win! Who else would it be?\" he realized that his voice was louder than necessary. \"I'm sorry\" Maestro added in a softer tone, if it weren't for Win he might have been way worse off. Win only nodded, growing even fainter and The Maestro guessed that he was running out of strength. \"We should go back to the others and talk about this.\" Win suggested, The Maestro only gave a weary murmur in response, not looking forward to the long trek back to his home. All that night she couldn't sleep, partly it was because she remembered how Timothy would always whimper, and mutter things in his sleep. The other half of it was the fact that she had met the infamous Maestro face to face and she had every attention of going off to see him again whenever the chance came. How could she not? Every time she thought about her brother, her belly would roll into this apprehensive knot. Blue rolled over so that she room instead of the wall. Timothy's side of the room was just as he left it, covers tossed back from the bed, clothes and toys mixed together in a messy sea on the floor only with a few comic books and the like. The only thing missing was Timmy himself. \"I'll find you\" She whispered into the empty room \"I promise…\" Authors Note: A extra long update for a extra long wait! I have to say, at one point Maestro might have sounded crazy with the ghosts voices being in his head and all of that, but like they can speak to each other telepathically, I call it Mind Speak, but the ability to do so dwindles with distance and that's why he could barely hear them, it's the same as when Win (Or any other ghost) can't fully project himself to Maestro because the distance is to much. So, Maestro gets quite the first impression. And I added a brief POV at the end of Blue, but I probably won't go into her POV much. If you guys liked her I might venture into her a few more times though.

You rock! Disclaimer: Do you really think if i owned Wimbledon that Pete would have ended up with Lizzie instead of me? Dream on pal... Chapter one - It's tactical! If he loses I get rich and if he wins I get laid. Nobody had believed it could happen. If Jesus himself had come down from heaven and said quite blatantly 'Listen people of London… Peter Colt will win Wimbledon' they still wouldn't have listened. It had to be the biggest miracle in the history of tennis. So as Peter Colt downed yet another shot and his hands rose in triumph, laughing to his brother's protests that as he was older it was easier for him to hold his liquor he felt euphoria at the thought of having being a major part of said miracle. And not only that but right beside him shaking her head was the love of his life. Lizzie would have much preferred him be sober on the night of his win so she could steal him away for the night and not have to decipher the slur that his speech was currently being replaced for. But as long as she was with him she didn't really care how high his alcohol intake was. He'd won anyway; he had the right to celebrate. Just as long as the next morning he was in a decent mood to do some serious talking. Peter didn't have the hangover he'd expected… yes the disbelief was still there but not the aching and the vomiting and the stars he'd expected. The smell of bacon drew him to the kitchen where he found Lizzie busily rushing around the kitchen. 'Now, wasn't I the one that cooked in this outfit?\" She looked up and greeted his smile. \"I thought you might need a break. Besides, I make a mean Omelette.\" Pete smiled at her and sat at the end of the table, \"We'll see how mean.\" The omelette turned out to be extremely delicious, and he was reluctant to admit it but not only did it kick his cooking's ass it had an exotic spice his mother could only dream of. \"So… What'd you think?\" She asked pouring some juice. \"I think you should cook more often.\" He said patting his stomach and leaning forward to take the juice. \"We need to talk.\" \"Uh oh. Nothing ever good comes from those words.\" Peter said almost choking on his juice, \"What? Did Jake steal you away last night when I was intoxicated and couldn't fight him off cave man style?\" \"Well he tried… but I don't date losers remember?\" \"Ah how could I forget? It's very lucky I didn't lose then.\" \"Back on topic.\" Lizzie said softly. Peter resided and waved his hand issuing she should let lose. \"Well see, I live in America.\" \"Really? I wondered why the flag your fans waved was different to mine.\" \"Seriously... see I was thinking of taking a holiday after Wimbledon... before I even met you...\" \"Oh god... wait don't tell me you have a secret boyfriend in the bahamas and haven't got around to telling me yet.\" \"No you dumb ass.\" Lizzie said laughing, \"I was thinking of staying with you as an option.\" Peter wondered why this was such a problem, \"How long?\" \"A month… But see I don't have any money.\" \"Ah I see it now. What Jake was talking about I mean… the moocher right?\" Lizzie laughed again, she wished he could take it seriously… he was taking things seriously the day before. \"All that winning Wimbledon has given you a big head… Seriously I cannot just depend on you for an entire month!\" \"I don't see why not.\" \"Because our relationship has faired… what two weeks?\" \"Look Lizzie. I don't care about the time…\" \"I do.\" Lizzie said biting her lip. \"Fine… you can earn your way by cooking for me every day.\" \"Peter.\" She complained in a whiney voice. \"Lizzie.\" He said mirroring her tone. \"I don't think it's such a good idea so early in the relationship… I just thought about it as being an idea... as a way to spend more time with you before getting back to... reality really. But i think things are moving a bit fast... So I don't know.\" \"Look. I get this is complicated right? You living in America and everything which you were so quick to point out… and you with your career that has only just started up. But I think we should just apply the 'We'll cross that bridge when we come to it' strategy. I want you to stay. Besides I was musing during the game that we could get this place fixed up.\" He added looking up at the messy blotchy walls that he'd become accustomed to. \"I get that we've only been together two weeks... but to quote many really old cliched movies I'm falling for you hard.\" She smiled at him before frowning and adding, \"You know i don't like that bridge strategy.\" \"Well Lizzie I think it's about time you start to like it\" So... what did you think?

Lizzie turned slightly in her seatnand leant back onto Peter's shoulder to get a better look at thenreasonably large building. \"Wow,nyou Brits really know how to build them…\" she said looking at himnupside down by bending her head backwards. \"What?\"nPeter said with a small laugh, \"your house is smaller than mynmum's?\" he finished teasingly. Shenstuck out her tongue at him. Then she began to speak in that phoneynBritish accent that she used that night on the tennis court innBrighton. \"Nonmy love, I was in fact referring to the tree house in the garden,\"nshe pointed a finger towards the mentioned structure. Peternwas about to reply with a rather witty comment but his brother, whonhad just exited through the small side door of the house, shouted andninterrupted their bickering… Unfortunate… \"HeynPeter!\" he shouted, almost falling over in his desperate sprintnover the gravel driveway. He reached the car and slammed into thenside, panting heavily. Apparently all that cycling was just for show. Peternlooked at him with one eyebrow raised. \"Carl?\" Carlndidn't look at Peter but kept his eyes on Lizzie. Henflicked his hair and dropped his right hip, the picture was somewhatnruined by the large bit of Bolognese sauce on his chin. Peter, whonhad unfortunately known this man all his life, knew what was coming. \"Buggernoff, Carl. She's taken,\" he defended good-naturedly getting outnof the car and closing the door. Lizzie followed suit and got out ofnthe car, after, of course, Carl had gotten out of the way. \"YeahnI know, I'm just keeping my charm nice and aired,\" he triednfollowing Peter who began making his way towards the house. Lizzienwas beside him soon and holding his hand out of habit… and love. \"Yes,nwell, maybe you should try airing a facecloth for that bit of saucenon your chin,\" Peter shot back, not looking at his brother. Carlnquickly dropped away from the pair, obviously trying to wipe thenoffending sauce off his face with some form of clothing. Neithernwanted to see which. Beforenthe couple could reach the house, Peter's mother was alreadynrunning towards them. The smile that was spread across her facenlooked like it had been painted there since earlier on that day…nyou know, since her son won Wimbledon and all. \"There'snmy two star tennis players now!\" she said, more like flittingntowards them with her arms outstretched. She hugged both of them innturn- Peter first because he was blood and then Lizzie but with thensame enthusiasm. Lizzienand Augusta hadn't even been introduced, but Augusta was toonecstatic for that yet. But after the hugging, she calmed and with ansigh looked almost lovingly at Lizzie. \"NownPeter, you will be so kind to introduce me to this young lady…\"nAugusta said, fingering the tea towel she held in her hand. Carlnwalked by and grabbed it off her wiping his face and thenndisappearing back into the house. Of course Augusta already knew whonLizzie was but she was one for the old ways where everyone wasnintroduced to everyone. \"Well,nMum, this is Lizzie Bradbury, Lizzie this is my mum, Augusta Colt…\"nhe said being mockingly formal. Augusta playfully slapped him on thenarm before politely shaking Lizzie's hand. \"Anpleasure, Lizzie.\" \"Nicento meet you Mrs. Colt-\" \"Ohnplease, call me Augusta!\" Afternall the introductions were made, everyone went into the house andnmade their way into the large traditional kitchen. \"Inreally appreciate you two coming here for dinner, I know that younwould prefer to be out partying now,\" Augusta said. \"Oh,non the contrary, it's nice to get away from everything…\" Lizziensaid, sitting down beside Peter on the sofa that sat in the corner ofnthe kitchen. \"Yeah,nthe bloody press are going mad. They're like flies at feedingntime,\" Peter explained, putting his arm around Lizzie'snshoulders. Andnso, dinner was had, wine was drunk and late that night, Lizzie andnPeter went home… to his flat in Brighton. Thenpair entered his flat and Peter turned to the door, locking itnsecurely behind him. He was about to turn but felt two arms wrappingnaround his neck. He smiled as she pulled off his jacket and threw itnoff to the side out of the way. Henturned and placed his hands gently on her hips. She took a stepncloser to him and closed her arms tighter around his neck. Shenstretched up, almost onto her toes and kissed him tenderly, love,npassion, pride and adoration all flowed through her lips and he knewnthat he was the happiest man in the world. Thinkingnback to earlier that morning. He had nothing and now he hadneverything. The change was welcomed though. Standing on the court…nCentre court, the stands full of British and American people, rootingnfor their favourite player, for their fellow countryman. He couldnfeel the pressure bearing down on him with each point lost, eachnserve given, and each tennis ball hit. And Lizzie was angry with him.nThat was what stung most of all. He desperately hoped that she hadnseen, or even heard the interview that he had been in before thenmatch. It was slightly embarrassing but it needed to be said and henwould have done it a thousand times to get her back… Butnhis mind went blank after that. Lets suffice to say that Peter was slightly preoccupied with… something… someone else. Lizzienawoke the next morning in a haze of euphoric happiness. The sun wasnshining through a gap in the linen curtains that hung over thenwindow. Luckily it fell far away enough from the bed that she didn'tnfeel the need to rise and close them. She was happy exactly wherenshe was. Shensighed, knowing that she would never get back to sleep now. Once shenwas awake she was awake and that was it. She slowly, groggily proppednherself up on one elbow and blinked a few times to clear her blurrynvision. She looked to her left and saw Peter still asleep, lookingntotally content. Shenwanted this moment to last forever, but she knew that there would benmany more happy moments to come. So, she didn't want to the momentnto end, but she couldn't wait to spend more time with Peter… Morentime with Peter that is while he was conscious. Shenleaned over him, much like she had done a few days before and gentlynstroked his mussed, strawberry blonde hair. He stirred slightly butnhis eyes did not open. This time, she did not have to get up to phonenher Dad… This time she did not need to get up to train. This time,nshe was exactly where she was supposed to be… Shenshimmied closer to him and lay down closer beside him. Resting hernhead on his chest she sighed and closed her eyes. She gently rubbednthe tips of her fingers over his ribs in an absent-minded way. Then,nshe felt a hand softly stroking her hair. She smiled again, and tooknanother deep breath in before turning her head to look at him. Peter'sneyes were only half open and he looked down one her with a smallnsmile on his face. \"Goodnmorning Mr Wimbledon Champ,\" she whispered, slowly sitting up. Shensmiled and moved his hand to hers. She resumed her previous positionnof sitting propped up on her elbow and looking down at him. Henblinked a few times and then sat up mirroring her position exactly. \"What?\"nhe said a mock look of confusion on his face. Shenshrugged playfully and looked away from him. \"No…nwhat?\" Shenstill just looked away from him, giggling inanely to herself. \"Nothing…nNothing at all…\" she teased, still looking around the room,neverywhere but him.

They'd had to separate after Peter's Wimbledon win: he to tie up things at his end, and Lizzie needed to get back to the US to work on her serve and get ready for the upcoming US Open. Being apart had been miserable. Emails, texts and long distance calls weren't the same, and the next time they saw each other was when he arrived for the US Open Opening Gala night three weeks later. There was loud music playing, spotlights flashing and people everywhere as he stepped into the building. \"Shame you're not playing,\" one man exclaimed, throwing out his hand when he entered. \"We could have done with another British winner.\" \"Uh yeah,\" Peter replied absentmindedly, shaking the hand that was already in his grasp. \"If you'll excuse me, I'm looking for someone.\" He didn't hear the response, already moving into the throng of people, searching. He found her not long after, seated at the bar. With a smirk, he made his way over. \"Anyone sitting here?\" He saw the delight in her eyes when she turned, before she decided to play along with the game. \"I'm actually waiting for someone.\" \"Oh,\" he feigned. \"Perhaps I can wait with you in the meantime? The name is Peter. Peter Colt.\" \"Well, hello Peter Peter Colt,\" she giggled, stretching out a hand. \"I'm Lizzie Bradbury.\" He took the hand and more when he tugged her upright into his arms and kissed her soundly then and there. Easing back, her arms were firmly around his neck. \"God I've missed you.\" She stood on her tippy toes to peck him on the lips. \"Not as much as I have.\" \"Leave?\" he asked hopefully. She laughed as he tightened her grip on her. \"We just got here!\" \"So?\" She patted his chest, fixing his shirt collar. \"One hour,\" she promised. His eyes darkened with desire. \"I'm counting.\" It was 39 minutes later when, separating for the first time, Peter returned from the toilet to find Lizzie talking with Jake Hammond. He swiftly made his way over. Sliding his hand over Lizzie's hip, he encircled her waist, splaying his fingers across her abdomen in a blatant show of possession. She clearly didn't mind, covering his hand with hers and tilting her head to be kissed. It was natural, and so he did just that. He knew they were both grinning like idiots when they parted and faced Jake again. \"Oh for fucks sake,\" the hot-headed man swore before storming off. \"Someone needs to teach him about manners,\" admonished Peter, dropping his head to her shoulder to speak softly into her ear. Lizzie snorted as she raised a hand to cover her mouth as Peter's grip on her tightened and he nuzzled at her neck. She smiled as she tilted her head to be kissed again. Parting, she bit her bottom lip gleefully. \"Let's get out of here.\" He was startled. \"You sure? You've still got fourteen mi...\" He trailed off as she looked at him with an amused expression. \"Oh sod it.\" Clasping her hand firmly, he dragged her toward the door without much ceremony. \"Good night everyone,\" he bellowed before she laughed and pushed him out the door. Heading for the carpark, he stilled. \"Do you have a car?\" he suddenly questioned. \"I got here by taxi.\" She couldn't stop laughing at the incredulity of the situation. \"Right this way.\" They made it to the side of the car before, as Lizzie fiddled with the keys, he covered her body with his, pressing them against the door. Driving anywhere was momentarily forgotten as they partook in a spontaneous make out session. Eventually parting, both breathing heavily, it was Peter who reached for the keys. \"Let's get out of here.\" Next chapter: A proposal.[Chapter 2] Disclaimer: I own nothing, except my own creations. Lizzie didn't make it to the finals, but they were both there to watch the big match: a showdown between the Williams sisters. Seated side by side, Peter's arm at her back, her hand on his thigh, their hands rarely left each other as they enjoyed the spectacle. It was in the third set that Lizzie began to notice that Peter was spending more time looking at her than looking at the match. \"Game's that way,\" she chided gently, gripping his jaw to turn him in the right direction. \"Mm,\" he acknowledged vaguely. She smirked and turned her own attention back to the game, only to discover not long after that he was looking at her again. \"What?\" she said, grinning. \"I need to ask you something,\" he said seriously. \"Now?\" she replied incredulously, half an eye on where the sisters were playing the tie-breaker. Peter paused a moment. \"Yes now.\" Sliding from his chair, Lizzie's eye grew wide as he knelt on one knee. \"Peter...\" she breathed, her hand covering her mouth. All those around them remained oblivious, the game tense, as he drew forth a little box. Opening it, his hand shaking slightly, he held it up. \"Lizzie.\" He swallowed and tried again. \"Elizabeth Bradbury, will you marry me?\" He didn't leave it there and continued to speak. \"This past month has made me realise that frankly, I can't live without you, and I want you in my life-\" \"Yes.\" \"-permanently. I love y... What did you say?\" \"Yes.\" She was crying happily now as she laughed. \"Yes, I'll marry you.\" He did the only thing he could think of; jumping up to tug her into his arms and kiss her soundly. The crowd was cheering madly around them when they parted and he slid the ring on to her finger. \"You've just made me the happiest man in the world.\" She intertwined his fingers with hers as she grinned. \"I know.\" Their lips met again, intent only on each other. Parting when the need to breathe became paramount, they were both grinning like idiots. \"Who won?\" \"I haven't the foggiest.\" Next chapter: An interview.[Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I own nothing, except my own creations. \"It's been a year since Peter Colt pulled off one the biggest upsets in history, winning Wimbledon and becoming the first Brit in a long time to do so on home soil. \"So how has your life changed for you?\" asked Maria Corillo, turning to her guest.

I flinched at the sound of his voice, which was something I'd never done before. He usually sounded so friendly and kind whenever he talked or shouted across the room. Now his voice had a sharpened edge to it, which I had rightfully deemed as \"strange\". \"I-it's almost done, master! I'm just trying to figure out this Keurig machine! I've never dealt with this contraption before!\" I stammered. I had the K-cup in my hand, but I wasn't sure on where to place it. I'd lived in William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet play since the day it was made, which was a very long time ago. New-age contraptions were SO not my forte! \"Well, hurry it up! You're not a human anymore. You're a floating spirit, so you can float around and get things done!\" Maestro shouted back. Panicking, I hurriedly tried to see if I could open any flaps. Once I found one that fit the K-cup, I shoved the cup into the hole. Then I shoved a cup underneath the pourer-thingy and hit the BREW button. Not bad for a first attempt. When the tea was finished, I brought the steaming-hot cup over to the kitchen, where Maestro was sitting at the clear-glass table. His arms were hugging his head, which was pressed firmly on the glass surface. \"Hey, the tea's finished. Hope you like English Breakfast,\" I said, nudging him with my finger. Maestro looked up, and when I saw his face, I reeled back a little bit. He looked terrible now. His hair was dull and flat, and his face wore slightly dark bags under his eyes. \"Hmm? Thanks, Juliet. I appreciate it,\" he muttered, taking a small sip of the K-cup tea. I waited to see what he thought of it, but all I got was his head clunking against the table instead. \"Maestro, why have you been like this? Ever since the confrontation with the mayor, you've been…,\" I started to say, but before I could finish my statement, Maestro jumped up from the table. The tea on the table spilled a little bit at this sudden movement. \"Juliet Capulet, don't you DARE bring up that day! I may have made peace with the townspeople, but that evil mayor still taints my mind!\" he shouted. I looked at him in shock when he said those words. He was usually quick to forgive and forget. I know it was a more serious matter this time around, but still. Maestro always found some way to forgive people. \"I'm sorry. I won't bring it up again. Why don't you go upstairs and take a nap? I'll see if Romeo wants to finish the tea,\" I said, gently taking the teacup. Maestro groaned and stood up, staggering out of the kitchen. I sighed and brought the teacup into the ballroom, which served as the main room for the inhabitants of the house. My lover, Romeo Montague, was floating on his back, not giving a damn about anything in the world. When I approached him, he stopped floating and smiled at me. \"Hi, Juliet. Ooh, you brought tea for me? Thank you!\" he exclaimed, taking the barely-touched tea from me. But instead of drinking the tea right away, he started eyeing me with great concern. I guess he saw my growing depression. \"Hey, what's the matter? Did Maestro light into you?\" Romeo asked, taking my transparent hand. I nodded, which made him drop the cup to the ground. I heard it shatter into a million pieces, but I really didn't care at the moment. \"He's not himself anymore. Ever since that day with the mayor, Maestro has been acting weirdly. His hair's gone flat, and his face is completely dismal. Not to mention the fact that he only yells at the spirits instead of talking to them now. Romeo, what are we going to do?\" I asked. I was desperate now. If there wasn't a way to fix Maestro, then I might as well just go to the afterlife with my Montague lover. \"Let's just wait, Julie. Let's just wait and see if everything will look up later,\" Romeo suggested. I sighed and put my hand on his chest. Only time would tell. Only time would tell.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two: Strange Acts \"Maestro! Dinnertime!\" I called out, bringing out the last meal I'd made. The other spirits were sitting in their respective spots at the long dining table, ready to dive into my homemade cuisine. But I didn't hear footsteps come to the dining room, which was really odd. \"Well, that's weird. Doesn't the master usually come the minute you say it's dinnertime?\" Mercutio asked from his spot at the table. Instead of responding to him, I walked into the foyer and headed upstairs, walking in the direction of Maestro's room. His room isn't hard to miss. It's a large door that's made of cracking wood, which he simply refused to replace. When I got to said door, I gently pushed it open, not even bothering to knock before entering. \"Maestro, didn't you hear me? It's dinner-,\" I started to say, but gasped when I saw his room. Pictures of the town mayor were taped and stapled to the clear white wall, and if you looked at the ground, papers with cursive writing were strewn all over. I walked over to one of the paper piles and picked one up. In perfect script, it read, \"KILL THE MAYOR\". No. No, this wasn't the Maestro that I knew and loved. Before I could call his name again, I heard something being scraped. A knife. \"Maestro?\" I called again, turning in the direction of the sound. Instead of seeing him there, I saw a closed door, which led to his in-room facilities. I dropped the paper and walked towards the door, putting my ear on it to find out what was going on. \" He will pay. He'll pay for everything. He'll pay for trying to kick me out. He'll pay in his own crimson blood ,\" Maestro muttered from inside the bathroom. Then I heard the scraping again, which got me to feel afraid. He definitely wasn't himself anymore. Without thinking, I pushed the door open, wanting nothing more than to stop him. Sure enough, Maestro was sharpening a kitchen knife with a well-rounded rock. \"What…are you DOING in here?!\" he rasped, his eyes taking on the psychotic look. I held my hands up in surrender, letting him know that I wasn't planning to hurt him or anything. \"I heard what you said. You're not killing the mayor, no matter what he did,\" I said. I expected him to turn the knife on me, but instead, he tried to deny it. There was no sense in doing so, since I'd heard him clearly through the door. \"I'm not planning to kill the mayor. That's purely ridiculous,\" Maestro said, attempting to flush the knife in the toilet. That didn't work, since the toilet water started coming up. \"Then explain the knife and the pictures you have of the mayor on your walls. I've cleaned your room every day to know that that's a new thing. That and the papers on the ground that say 'KILL THE MAYOR',\" I pointed out. Maestro glared at me with serious contempt, which scared me now that I knew he was slowly turning into a psychopath. Any other time, and I wouldn't have felt so afraid. \"Juliet, I suggest that you get out of here. If you don't, I'll kill you ,\" he said. I gulped and floated backwards, suddenly feeling scared for my life. Maestro usually said things like, \"I'll kill you!\" or whatever, but he usually meant no harm by those words. It was usually out of fun, and I never felt afraid whenever he said that. But now it had a whole other meaning to it, and I didn't like that. Even transparent spirits can be hurt by physical attacks too. \"I-I'm sorry for intruding,\" I stammered, and with the fear still lingering in me, I floated out of the bedroom and into the hall, not even bothering to look back.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three: The Next Day… \"And that's the latest on the fashion show! In other news, a family in Normal Valley was brutally murdered, with only a note left behind. It appears that a person named… Maestro wrote it,\" the reporter on the TV said. The minute she said those words, I stopped dusting the lamp table and paused. Romeo, who was helping me straighten out the room as well, stopped too. He looked at me, his eyes filled with sudden concern. \"Juliet, you went to go check on him last night, right? Did he act strangely to you?\" he asked. I looked at him and nodded, fighting back tears. Romeo dropped the sofa pillow that he'd been holding and put his hands on me. \"Listen, if he did anything to you while you were up there, I want you to tell me right away. Did he do anything?\" he added. I nodded, the tears finally pouring out. \"I went up to his room to check on him, and when I walked in, I saw pictures of the mayor attached to his walls. I also saw papers that said, 'KILL THE MAYOR', and then I heard a knife being scraped. I walked in that direction and realized that it was coming from his bathroom. Then I heard him say that the mayor would pay in blood or something like that, and when I questioned his motives, Maestro threatened to kill me. And it wasn't one of those I'm-messing-with-you kinds!\" I exclaimed. Romeo looked at me with widened eyes, like he couldn't believe that Maestro would do such a thing. Not like I blamed him. I hadn't expected it either. \"And now he's murdered an innocent family here in our hometown,\" I said, sobbing into Romeo's transparent chest. He patted my head and then let me go, placing his hands on my shoulders. \"Juliet, you won't have to worry anymore. We'll leave tonight, okay? We'll leave and just haunt some other abandoned house. Maestro can't do anything to us if we just go,\" he assured me. I nodded, agreeing to that idea. Anything was better than living with that psychopath that I called \"Maestro\".[Chapter 4] Chapter Four: The Party \"Oh, Romeo! Juliet! Where are youuuu ?\" Maestro's voice echoed. I flinched at hearing his voice. I really hated doing that, but after he murdered that innocent family, I had no choice but to. I reluctantly floated out of my room and went downstairs, wondering what was going on in that psycho's brain now. When I got to the first step, I saw Romeo standing with Maestro, not knowing what he was doing there. \"Oh, my dear! Where's that lovely red dress that you wore in that Shakespearean play? Juliet Capulet, I expected better of you!\" Maestro exclaimed. Before I could ask why I would even wear that again, Romeo jumped in with an explanation. \"He wants us to attend a party at the mayor's manor, but he wants us to show up in our costumes from William Shakespeare's play,\" he said. I nodded, understanding his point right then and there. \"Okay. I'll get it.\" … When we got to the party, I saw millions of partygoers gathered around a giant tent, martini and wine glasses in their hands. I inspected myself and made sure that no part of me was transparent, since looking like a dead spirit would be completely wrong outside. After giving myself the once-over, I took a deep breath and waited for Maestro to park the car. All I needed now was for him to leave us to our independence. When he did so, Romeo and I planned to watch him from afar. We weren't going to let him murder another innocent family. Not like the one he killed before. When we entered the tent, there were even more partygoers inside. \"All right, you know what we're going to do, right?\" Romeo asked me, putting on the mask that he wore in the play. I nodded, putting on my own mask as well. \"Yes. We are to make sure that Maestro doesn't commit any harm to anybody here. If he does, one of us is expected to possess him and pull him away from the desired victims,\" I said. That really was our plan for the party, since we didn't have enough time to brainstorm it. We'd actually planned on escaping the house with Mercutio and the others, but then Maestro slammed this stupid party on us. When we found a good hiding spot deep inside, Romeo and I floated up and out of sight. Thankfully, we also had a good view of Maestro, so we could hide and keep a close eye on him. At the moment, he was merely chatting away with an unnamed female, so everything was safe for the time being. All of a sudden, Romeo started tugging at my red-velvet sleeve, snapping me out of my thoughts. \"The mayor's here. We have to warn him,\" he said. I looked around at the party scene below, and that was when I saw the town mayor. He didn't know the danger that he'd walk into. Then I remembered something from yesterday. \"That's right! When I walked into Maestro's room last night, I found that he was planning to kill the mayor! We have to go!\" I exclaimed. With that, Romeo and I shifted back to our ghost forms and flew down towards the mayor. As if knowing that we were there, the mayor turned around and saw us. Before he could scream at the sight of dead spirits, we put our ghostly hands on his mouth, muffling his words. \"Listen! We have to get you out of here! Believe it or not, Maestro is planning to murder you! I witnessed it last night! Please, you have to go!\" I exclaimed. Romeo and I then let go of the mayor's mouth, allowing him to speak again. \"Believe me, guys. I know what Maestro's capable of, especially since he killed that family in our hometown. All right, what do you want me to do? I don't see Maestro anywhere, so I don't know which direction I should head into,\" the mayor said. Without saying anything more, I floated into his body, completely possessing him. \"Juliet! What are you-,\" Romeo started to say, but I shushed him immediately. We didn't need Maestro to know that I possessed the mayor all willy-nilly JUST LIKE THAT. Possessing people was against the rules in our house, so if we got busted for doing exactly that, there'd be punishment to deal out. With Maestro's growing psychosis, the punishment would be WORSE. \"Quiet, Montague! With the mayor being in my control, I can sneak him out of this party without Maestro catching us. Besides, he's WAY into that skanky woman to even notice, but if you say anything, we're dead meat. Got it, Rome?\" I said, calling my dead lover by his pet name. Romeo nodded, understanding where I was coming from. With that, I started moving the mayor's body towards the tent exit, eager to get him out of there. But the next thing I knew, Romeo's face was contorted with panic, pointing to something behind me. I turned around and gasped when I saw who it was. It was Maestro, and he was planning to kill us now.[Chapter 5] Chapter Five: Getting Out of There \"Why, hello there, Mr. Mayor! Fancy seeing you this evening!\" Maestro said with forced enthusiasm. Right then and there, I knew he was scheming murder crimes in his head, and I refused to let him act on it. I was trying to help the mayor escape, and if Maestro thought that he could kill him off, he had another thing coming. \"It's nice to see you too, Maestro. You look great tonight. Well, I must be off. I promised my wife that I'd come home at a certain time so I could meet her sister for dinner. I'll see you soon, okay?\" I said, hoping that the excuse would work. But before I could make my way to the tent flap, Maestro put his hand on the arm that I didn't own. \"Juliet, let's face it. I've caught you in the act. You don't have to possess the mayor anymore,\" he said. I felt sweat run down the back of my neck. He caught me? How was that even POSSIBLE? I had to feign confusion now. \"What are you talking about? Who's Juliet?\" I asked, trying my best to look confused. Maestro merely smiled, which freaked the 4-letter-S-word out of me. \"Juliet, leave this man's body right now!\" he suddenly growled. I narrowed my eyes and picked up a folding chair. Maestro's eyes widened right on the spot. \"No, Maestro. I won't ,\" I retorted, and without putting any thought into my actions, I threw the chair at him with as much force as possible. He fell down in complete shock, clearly not expecting the cruel and hard blow. The female partygoer that he'd been conversing with went directly to his aid. Even though she'd only known him for a short time, she was more than willing to play lover. While she was trying to take care of him, I ran out into the nighttime and far away from the party tent, with Romeo floating on my heels.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six: Confrontation When we finally got back to Someplace Else, which is my home address, I let myself out of the mayor's body. I waited for him to regain his composure, and once he did, I flung open the tall doors and shoved him inside. Romeo slammed the doors behind us, and I continued to push him down to the ballroom. \"Great! I'm back in this stupid hellhole again! I still have those memories of last time engraved into my head!\" the mayor exclaimed once I let him go. Romeo slapped him upside the head in response, which I definitely didn't oppose. \"Well, last time, Maestro wasn't planning to kill you, compared to what's going on NOW! Now, come with Romeo and me. We're going to shove you into the dumbwaiter!\" I replied, snatching the mayor's arm. Without saying anything more, I dragged him into the kitchen, where I saw the dumbwaiter open in plain sight. I looked over at Romeo in alarm. \"Romeo Montague, you'd better tell me why the dumbwaiter shaft's open!\" I exclaimed, almost afraid to go near the shaft itself. Romeo shook his head and whimpered, clearly not knowing why it was open. Before we could even move, a cloud of purple smoke appeared in the shaft space, and once it dissipated, I found myself staring at Maestro himself. He was smiling at us, and it was a smile that would put you out of your misery. \"Pleasure to see you this fine evening, my darling dead spirits,\" he said. The minute he said those words, Romeo and I turned ourselves into living humans and stood in front of the mayor. \"What do you want from us? All we want to do is protect the mayor from you of all people! Conspiring to kill him, my arse!\" I exclaimed. But Maestro didn't seem the least bit stunned. He hopped out of the dumbwaiter and folded his arms, facing Romeo and me. \"Juliet, I'm surprised at you. When I found you wandering the streets of England after black magic spilled on your pathetic play, I was the one who took you in after you couldn't find your way to the afterlife. I've been taking care of you all these years, and you repay me with a sharp tongue? Mm-mm. Not in my house,\" he said. I chose to shut up, but apparently, the mayor wasn't going to keep his mouth shut. I wish he would, but he clearly wasn't very bright when it came to that. \"Maestro, they have every right to treat you like this. You want to kill me, huh? What did I ever do to you besides that one time?\" he asked. Maestro's smile turned into a death glare, which was something I'd learned to fear. Romeo started shrinking back when he saw that glare happen. \"That one time was enough for me. You think you can kick me out of my own hometown? I've spent my entire 419 years here, and you have the audacity to try and kick me out? That was enough to make me conspire to kill you. And now that you're here…I can ,\" Maestro said. Before I could do anything, the mayor was flung into the dumbwaiter, the door closing right after. \"Hey, wait a sec-,\" I started to say, but then the door opened and Romeo and I were flung inside. Surprisingly, we were all able to fit inside that small shaft. Maestro smiled triumphantly and grabbed hold of the shaft door. \"Have a good trip, kiddies. See you on the other end.\"[Chapter 7] Chapter Seven: Murder When the dumbwaiter finally finished falling, the shaft door opened immediately, spilling us all out. When we got to our feet and collected our senses, we saw Maestro standing there, a smooth white apron pulled over the front of his body. Unfortunately, his apron was stained with crimson-red blood, and his hand was clasped around a large kitchen knife. \"Finally! I've been waiting for that dumbwaiter shaft to come down!\" he said, tapping the knife against his other hand. The minute he said that, he shot his hand out at us, a shining white beam flying out of his palm. Before Romeo and I could react, the beam divided into two separate rays and hit us square in the stomachs. After that happened, we decided to go back to our true phantom forms, but when we tried that, we realized we couldn't revert. \"What the…I can't change back!\" I exclaimed, trying with all my might to turn back into a spirit. Maestro smiled in response, placing the knife back into a chopping block. So that's where it went. \"That's the whole point, Capulet girl. Your 'living' form is now permanent, as I will be… putting you to sleep with you like this,\" he explained. I looked at him with a facial expression that had extreme horror and shock mixed into one. I'd been living with and loving him since 1594, the date that Romeo and Juliet had been tainted with black magic, causing Romeo and me to leap out. The man that we'd turned to after failing to find the afterlife…was the one who was tainted now. \"What's going on with you, Maestro? This isn't you! This isn't the man who took us in when the path to the afterlife wasn't available! What happened to you? I know what the mayor did wasn't good and all, but you've got to let it go. You're still living here in Normal Valley. Let's just move on, okay?\" I said. But instead of agreeing to that, Maestro's expression turned into a seriously angry one. \"Fine. I'll move on…when you, Romeo, and the mayor DIE! \" he shrieked, and before I could make any movements, an invisible force knocked me into the wall, shackles wrapping around my wrists and ankles. I tried to scream out for Romeo and the mayor to run, but they were slammed into the wall as well, shackles tying them in by the wrists and ankles too. \"Oh, god! Lord, help us!\" Romeo practically cried. Without thinking, I tried to turn into a spirit again, as did Romeo. It still didn't work. That magic spell talk was real. Holy crap, there was no escape for us! I watched as Maestro picked up a meat cleaver and brought it over to us. It was so bloodstained that I didn't see a single shine of silver, which made me mentally freak out. If I really freaked out right then and there, I probably would've died already. \"This cleaver has been with me for so many years that I can't even count anymore. But as you can see, I didn't just use it for various forms of poultry. Unless, of course, you count chopped-up flesh as meat,\" he said, swiping his finger along the dried blood. I started hyperventilating immediately, which made Maestro flash a super-fake sympathetic look in my direction. \"Aw, is the poor little Capulet a scaredy-cat? Guess I got to make sure you conquer your fear. Now, how on Earth am I going to make you do so? Oh! I know! I'll tap you with the cleaver and test your reaction!\" he told me, raising the cleaver. I tried to open my mouth to scream, but then the cleaver came down on my red-sleeved arm, cutting through my skin. \"Maestro…stop! Please, I beg of you! Stop!\" I shouted, jerking in all directions. Maestro pulled the cleaver out, and thrust it into my other arm, blood pouring out. I didn't realize that I had that much blood in my body. \"Well, Juliet? Did you conquer your fear yet?!\" he shrieked, twisting it in a little further. Tears started flowing out of my eyes and stained my cheeks, which was something that had never happened before. Once again, Maestro pulled his weapon out, but this time, he threw it…into my stomach. I gasped in horror, my eyes starting to blur. I couldn't believe it. My friend…my formerly wonderful friend…was killing me. And he'd killed that family in Normal Valley. Why was this happening? Why was Maestro going psycho?! \"Why…?\" I gasped out, but after getting a few more gasps in, my eyes shut all by themselves, blackness consuming my vision. I could no longer serve as a wandering spirit.[Chapter 8] Chapter Eight: Everything…Was Just a Big, Sick Joke? \"Juliet! Juliet, wake up! Please, I'm begging you! Wake up!\" I heard Romeo say. I fought to open my eyes, but the minute they were opened, I saw my lover standing over me. I put my hand to my forehead, sitting up on the surface that I was on. \"Romeo? Is that you?\" I replied. All of a sudden, Romeo wrapped his arms around me, sobbing into my dress. It was most definitely him. \"Juliet! Oh, my stars! I thought you were dead!\" he exclaimed. I hugged him back, and that was when I saw my arms. There were large, cleaver-made cuts that had dried blood coming out. It freaked me out, so I let go of Romeo immediately. He looked at me in confusion, but then he saw my arms. \"So Maestro…really intended to kill me, huh? Should've known he was going to do that. He was already acting strange when I found him huddled in the bathroom with a kitchen knife,\" I said, but that was when a flood of memories came back. The mayor. Maestro was planning to ultimately kill him when he got the opportunity. I needed to stop him! \"The mayor! Maestro's going to murder him!\" I shouted, hopping off the table that I had been on. If I didn't stop Maestro…the mayor would die! Nobody could stop that psycho…except for me! And maybe Romeo too, but I didn't really know. After a long ride down the dumbwaiter shaft, I was back in that awful room where I had been brutally murdered. Wait until he saw that his killing victim came back to life from the PERMANENTLY DEAD! With that in mind, I rolled up my sleeves, making my cleaver cuts visible. I walked through the room and searched for Maestro and the mayor. Maestro was going to pay for all the deeds he'd done. He'd pay for planning to kill the mayor. He'd pay for killing that family. And he'd definitely pay for trying to kill me. When I got to the back wall, I saw a hidden door there. Without thinking, I grabbed a large kitchen knife from the abandoned chopping block and shoved my head through the door, creating a large hole. \"HEEEEEERRRREE'S JULIET!\" I shouted, making direct eye contact with Maestro. He screamed in response and dropped a large pot that he'd been holding. With that, I used the knife and chopped down large bits of the door, making it perfectly accessible for me to enter. I wielded the knife like a killer and walked over to him, Maestro backing away as I did so. \"You sick bastard. You're going to pay for everything you've done. You conspired to kill the mayor. You murdered that innocent family, and you were about to bring Romeo into it. Not to mention the fact that you tried to kill me. Have you forgotten that dead people can't die twice? Look at me! Just look what you did to me! \" I shrieked, tightening my grip on the knife. \"Juliet, you've got it all wrong! I didn't kill that family! It was all a big joke! Look at the guests at the table. They're that family! It was a joke!\" Maestro flailed. I looked over at the table, where I saw dinner guests sitting patiently. They nodded their heads, agreeing with what Maestro was saying. But that didn't mean that he could get away with what he had done to me. \"That may have been a big joke, but what about me? Do you consider these cleaver cuts to be a joke? These are real , Maestro. They're real . But did I succumb to them? No, I didn't, because the dead can't succumb anymore! You know what that means? It means that I can get back at you for the cuts you left on me!\" I exclaimed. Before Maestro could reply, I snatched him by the arm and dragged him out of the broken door. Then I shackled him to the wall that he'd stuck me on earlier. \"W-wait! What are you doing to me?!\" he freaked, but instead of responding, I swiped the knife against his cheek, leaving a deep, crimson-red gash running down. Maestro looked at me in horror. \"This is for what you did to me. What, you expected me to let you off the hook so easily? Well, that wasn't going to happen,\" I told him. Maestro started flailing around, desperately trying to get out of the shackles. Pathetic. He knew it wasn't going to work. \"You can't do this to me! You can't!\" he shouted, the blood dripping onto his white shirt. I sighed and climbed into the open dumbwaiter, getting ready to ride the shaft back up. But not before I said my final three words to him. \" It's already done .\" FIN ","Summary":" Chapter One: Ever Since Then… \"Where's my tea?!\" I heard the master, Maestro, shout from the kitc"},{"Movie":"Ghosts, 1997","Title":"Is it scary for u?","Author":"Miri Fern","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10164968","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The following is a parody of a genre of fanfiction using the characters from Michael Jackson's Ghosts.

Yeah the name is stupid, but the people here are pretty much just that-normal! It gets really boring here, and a lot of the other kids at school think I'm a freak, so I don't have any friends. I wake up at 8:30 am. \"Oh crap!\" I yell, realizing that I'm late for school. I rush to get dressed and walk into the bathroom. I look at myself in the mirror: long blonde hair in waves that I dye green, hazel eyes with gold flecks, and a skinny body. Seeing my face makes me hate myself, I'm so ugly. To cover up my flaws, I wear tons of white foundation, purple eyeshadow, black eyeliner, and red lipstick. In the end, I look like the Joker, but that clearly doesn't have anything to do with my peers thinking I'm weird. I walk into the living room with my backpack, tottering on my high heels. My dad takes one look at my all black outfit, puts down his newspaper and coffee, and says, \"Go change into something more suitable, young lady.\" Did I mention my dad is the mayor of the town? My mom died of cancer when I was little, and I'm an only child. Anyways, my dad is old, fat, and obsessed with keeping everything in the town completely normal, just like the name would imply. I love him, because he is my father after all, but I hate him because he's so authoritative and he doesn't understand me. I give him the finger and then run out of the house. I have to walk to school, which is two miles away. By the time I get there, it's already lunch, but that's probably because I stopped along the way to help a bug get out of the road. I sit down with my tray and immediately this group of popular girls flounce over to me. \"Hey, loser.\" The leader, a blonde with freakishly large breast implants, says mockingly. \"Are you coming to the halloween party?\" The rest of them cackle like hyenas. \"Nobody invited me.\" I say mournfully. \"Well, it's at my house. You should dress up for it in a scary costume, or the bouncer won't let you in.\" More laughter. I punch her in the nose and run to class. Someone taped a sign reading \"FREAK\" to my desk. I run to the bathroom crying and slit my wrists. By then, the day had ended, so I started home. In the distance, I could see the spooky mansion, Someplace Else. My dad appears out of nowhere. \"Never go into that house, Savannah! A freak lives there and scare people for fun.\" \"Kind of like me.\" I murmur, a single tear escaping my eye. \"Oh, Savannah.\" My dad gives me a Kleenex. \"If you bothered to change, I'm sure people would like you more. If you acted more normal-\" \"I don't want to be normal!\" I scream, running into my room and slamming the door.[Chapter 2] I decide to go to the party, since I don't have anything better to do. Making up a costume from random crap lying around the house, I sneak out my bedroom window (my dad was asleep watching TV) and run towards the popular girl's house. There's loud music playing that I can hear from a block away. There are a bunch of jocks passed out drunk in the front yard, and one of them looks like he might be dead, or at least unconscious. I blow past them, my cheap cape flowing around me. When I ring the doorbell, a girl smoking a cigarette answers. \"What are you supposed to be, the polyester vampire?\" \"Let me pass, mortal.\" I reply, sweeping past her. Inside, people are raving. It's smoky from all the smokers, and somebody spiked the punch. They'd probably be doing drugs too, but there are no drugs to be found in Normal Valley. I just stand there in the living room for a while. There's a couple dressed like Batman and a slutty nurse making out on the couch. There are crushed chips all over the carpet. I'm bored, and so alone… When I go to the bathroom to cut myself again, somebody rips my cape off. I scream bloody murder, swing around, and beat them with a nearby lamp. The person, some guy in a zombie costume, screams and crawls away. I have the tendency to go psycho sometimes, but at least now I don't want to cut myself. Some guy cuts a glow stick in half and starts painting the green liquid inside on his skin and clothes. He's dressed like an alien, and probably drunk. I've calmed down, but now I'm restless. I walk outside and breathe in the cool night air. I take off my masquerade mask and sigh. Looking down over the edge of their deck, I wonder; should I jump, and end my miserable life? Once I've had enough of that crap, I go back inside and loot the pantry. When I find a bag of Cheetos, I come back out and the blonde girl who (sort of) invited me is standing there. \"Loser, your costume sucks. What are you even supposed to be?\" She asks, leaning her hand on the doorframe and her other hand on her hip. I shrug and start to walk past her, but she grabs my arm. \"We're gonna play a game. You wanna be in it?\" I lick the cheese dust off my fingers and shrug again. She starts pulling me down the hall. I think her name is Samantha or something. Her dad is always away on these business trips, and her mom is standing on the dining room table doing a strip tease for some older boys. Samantha or whoever takes me past them and into the garage. There are people there with flashlights. \"We're going to go up the hill to the spooky mansion and ding-dong-ditch it. If nobody comes out, we're going in to trash the place.\" Somebody walks by and grabs my bag of Cheetos. I resist the urge to rip out their jugular. \"Okay.\" \"You're going to go up and ring the doorbell.\" \"What if there isn't a doorbell? Not all old houses have doorbells.\" I point out. \"Then knock instead. Come on!\" With that, we start walking. Soon, we get to the gate of the house. \"I don't want to go in anymore.\" I say, looking scared. \"It looks dangerous.\" Samantha blows me off, pushing me through the tiny gap in the rusted gate. Shivering, I start walking. Halfway there, I stop and turn around. \"This is stupid! I want to go home!\" \"Do it, you big baby!\" Somebody shouts in response. I have no choice but to continue. Sure enough, there's no doorbell to ring, but there is a metal knocker. I pick it up and let it fall, which makes one helluva noise. Then, all of a sudden, lightning strikes, and I turn around, realizing that the kids are running back. \"What the heck?!\" I shout, holding my hands up. I feel a cold hand touch my shoulder, whirl around, and scream. But the hand is already yanking me inside of the house, and nobody seems to hear.[Chapter 3] A gust of wind blew through the house as the screaming Savannah was pulled in against her will and-wait. What the devil? The first person narrative has been changed to third! Oh, whatever. As I was saying... The person who had grabbed her pulled his skeleton mask away. He had not expected her to keep on screaming for help even after he revealed himself, but she did just that. \"Oh my God! Somebody help!\" He tried calming her, but his words of reassurance were drowned out by her wailing like a siren. Becoming fed up, he covered her mouth, forcing her to listen. \"It was just a joke! Calm down!\" The girl stared at him through eyes encrusted with makeup, then fell limp. He had to struggle to catch her-she was heavier than she looked. Great, she had fainted. Well, so much for only scaring her. No sooner had she gone spindly in his arms, the girl was awake again. \"What the heck? Where am I? Who are you?\" This change of tune encouraged him. \"You're in Someplace Else, and I'm the Maestro.\" She looked up and around. \"Oh. Okay.\" Her sudden calm unnerved him. He was constantly expecting her to start screaming again. \"Er…\" \"Put me down.\" She commanded. He obeyed without protest, setting her on her feet. \"May I ask who you are and why you knocked?\" The girl gave him a dull-eyed and slightly creepy look. \"I'm Savannah Chastity Cook.\" The mayor's daughter? Uh oh. \"And why are you here?\" \"I got dared by some people at a party.\" \"Is that what the costume is for?\" Her face was utterly serious. \"I'm a polyester vampire.\" O-kay. She was a strange girl, but he was weird himself. He could handle it… right? \"Why didn't you refuse? Going to the houses of strangers can be dangerous.\" \"I dunno.\" She studied him through her paper masquerade mask, and he began to feel funny. His knees seemed weak, and goosebumps traveled up and down his arms. This was getting disturbing. \"Well, you can go home now. I just wanted to scare you. A Halloween prank, you know?\" He forced a smile to hide his discomfort; her gaze intensified, and the smile faded. \"Um… what are you doing?\" \"Can you walk me home?\" He blinked. The stare was gone, and her eyes went dull and stupid again. He shook his head. \"I can't, sorry. I have things to do-\" \"Then I won't leave.\" She said matter-of-factly. \"I hate my house. My dad's a jerk.\" He couldn't help agreeing with her on that. \"You can't stay here. Your father will call the police.\" \"I don't care.\" She started to wander down one of the hallways. \"I'll stay here tonight.\" A sinking feeling developed in the pit of his stomach. \"Listen, you really should go home-\" But she had resorted to ignoring him. He sighed. \"I guess you can stay… but don't say I didn't warn you.\" \"Warn me about what?\" He started off in the other direction. \"You'll know when you see it.\" I walked past the Maestro guy and-oh, for Christ's sake! You changed the POV again! Bloody hell- The house was full of antiques and old crap. There were painting on the walls that were probably hundreds of years old and everything was covered in dusty old sheets. But the place was huge, and I wanted to explore it, because I'm a rebel who ignores warnings from adults. Maybe I'd get killed or something. That would be fine with me, since I hate myself. I passed by this room that had an old organ in it covered in cobwebs and dust. My asshole teen nature told me to start pounding on the keys, so I did. It was much louder than I thought it would be, and I got a feeling that I was summoning a demon from hell, so I stopped. Not because I'm religious or anything-because I didn't want to bother Satan and his minions right then, and I'd already sold my soul to the devil last week to get him to do my math homework for me. But when I turn around, the Maestro guy is standing behind me. \"What are you, some kind of stalker?\" I ask annoyedly. He grinned at me. \"Only in my spare time.\" He said. \"Your voice is different.\" I say-Great, now you've changed the past tense to present tense as well. I applaud you. Tool. \"Is it?\" He had his hands on his hips. \"You sound British. Are you high? Can I have some?\" He looks at me funny, then shrugs. \"Children your age should not be bothering with such vices.\" \"I agree completely.\" I say. He looks faintly irritated. \"You're not the same guy, are you?\" He looks surprised. \"How did you guess?\" \"I'm special.\" I explain. \"My mom died when I was little. She was probably a witch from another dimension, and I have secret magic powers I haven't discovered yet. Anyway, who are you really?\" \"I am Maestro's darkness. They call me…\" He raises an eyebrow suggestively. \"...Doctor Maestro.\" \"Cool beans.\" I nod. \"Do you know where I can sleep?\" \"That depends on who you want to sleep with.\" He grins. It makes him look unhinged. Sexy. \"Every room in this house is occupied by a ghost or a ghoul. So, who would you like to be your bedmate?\" \"Can't I just make Maestro give up his room?\" \"Maestro is not exempt from the rule. He shares a room with a ghost girl.\" For some reason, I am instantly jealous. \"Oh, yeah? Are they, like, together or something?\" \"Sort of.\" \"Is she prettier than me?\" \"She's quite plain, actually. Has a huge overbite and a weak chin. I don't know what he sees in her.\" He shudders. \"I'm sure she'd be no match for you. Especially since she is, you know, dead.\" I put my fingers together in an evil pyramid as I calculate, a dastardly plan to steal a man forming in my head. Hey, that rhymed. \"Excellent. I can begin preparations at once…\"[Chapter 4] Maestro tried not to think about the strange girl in his house, and walked upstairs to his room. He was quite exhausted by the whole ordeal, and really just wanted to get some sleep. He climbed into bed and shut his eyes, only to open them a few seconds later. The sheets were wet. Sitting up immediately, he pulled back the blankets. They were soaked through with red. Blood? Where had it come from? On the other side of the bed, he spotted a raised bump. Cautiously, he reached out and flung back the covers, flinching as he did. But it wasn't a dead body. It was something much worse. \"Why are you here?\" Savannah's dull eyes gleamed in the dark. Her hands were coated in the blood and her makeup was smudged. \"I wanted to see you.\" He shook his head. \"Where did all this blood come from?\" \"I dunno. It was like this when I got here.\" He sighed. \"Get out of my bed, please.\" \"I don't want to.\" \"I asked nicely.\" \"So?\" \"What do you want?\" \"I like you.\" \"I'm flattered. Now, would you please leave, so I can get some sleep?\" \"Why do you sleep with a ghost?\" Maestro blinked. \"Who told you that?\" \"Doctor Maestro.\" A look of such annoyance passed over his face, Savannah raised her eyebrows. \"You don't like him very much, do you?\" \"No one likes looking into a mirror and seeing… that.\" His nose wrinkled in disgust. \"Did he put you up to this, too?\" \"No. I don't like your girlfriend. I think you need a new one. Like me.\" She grinned stupidly. He shuddered. \"She's not my girlfriend. And you're only, what, fourteen?\" \"Age is nothing but a number. How old are you?\" \"That's a double negative.\" He grumbled, pinching the bridge of his nose. \"I'm a whole lot older than you, and have no wish to be branded a pervert. Now, would you please-\" Before he could finish, she had bolted up and out of the bed. She stopped at the door. \"Oh, yeah-I used my new magic powers to banish your girlfriend to development hell.\" \"What?!\" \"Bye!\" She slammed the door.[Chapter 5] In the high rafters of the mansion, a swirling maelstrom of dust and wind took shape. The maelstrom swirled violently, leaving a humanoid shape in it's wake. At once, whispers traveled up from the darkened depths. Something had been set in motion; someone was awake. The humanoid shape drifted, put out one bare foot, and fell from the rafters, sailing down on a draft of air. She rode the windy passages, and as she floated down shadows crept and crawled from beneath doors. The first whisper grew louder, and said, \"This has gone too far!\" Another replied, \"Maestro's darkness is to blame!\" \"We have lost one of our own!\" \"A plot!\" \"A conspiracy!\" She alighted on the floor with a soundless grace. The shadows were becoming tangible, first as jellyfish-like ectoplasm, before they molded themselves into more human forms. \"This is nothing so complex as to be called a conspiracy.\" Said the humanoid shape. \"We have simply encountered an… anomaly.\" \"A witch!\" \"A demon!\" \"A teenage girl!\" All eyes turned towards the last voice. A ghoul dressed as a jester covered his mouth with his hand. \"Sorry.\" Another ghoul sneered grotesquely, the flesh hanging off his ancient face. \"The witch child must be destroyed to restore the ghost!\" \"She's not a witch, you know.\" The ghoul turned. Doctor Maestro stood in the doorway. \"Does it matter?\" It growled. \"Yes, actually. You did say you wanted to destroy her…\" The doctor yawned, examining his nails. \"Anything can be killed by burning.\" Purred a lady with a parasol, her skin blue with death. The jester giggled maniacally. \"Death! Death! Ashes to ashes, dust to dust-\" Doctor Maestro glanced up. \"You're not the one who decides on these things. The decision is with Maestro.\" He smirked. \"But, seeing as how he isn't here, the choice falls to you, Katherine.\" The ghouls turned to face the humanoid shape that had fallen from the ceiling. A fragile, tubercular form in a long white nightgown with eyes like a cloudy blue sky. A ghost. She glared back at the doctor. \"You're taller.\" \"Am I?\" He walked towards her. \"Now that you mention it, I feel stronger than I ever have before. Can you imagine why?\" He got too close for comfort, and she shoved him. \"I don't know what game you're playing, but this isn't some kind of joke. She sent Wendy somewhere-\" \"To development hell, yes. Ever heard of it?\" She frowned. \"No.\" \"A shame. If you did know, you'd understand what the 'witch' really is.\" He turned his back on them. \"Wait!\" She reached for him, then lowered her hand. \"What do you know about her?\" \"Savannah? She is the mayor's daughter. Fifteen years old. A sociopath who has just developed magical powers as a result of her arriving here.\" He swiveled around, suddenly serious. \"Look-she's difficult to explain. But the important thing is, she has those powers as long as she remains in this house,\" he pointed down, \"and she won't want to leave. You can't kill her if she's here, and the longer she stays, the more likely that her father will figure out where she is and come after the Maestro. Again.\" The ghouls murmured amongst themselves. Katherine's eyes widened. \"How do we get rid of her, then?\" \"Easy enough. Get her to leave the house, and daddy dearest will take care of the rest.\" \"But if the mayor comes after the Maestro-\" \"That's the other problem.\" He put his hands in his pockets. \"See what I'm doing? All problems, no easy solutions.\" \"What about Wendy?\" She tried again. His eyes narrowed. \"Another problem. She's probably the hardest one yet. You may have to just forget about her.\" The jester began to sing nervously. \"Rose, rose, rose red; will I ever see thee again?...\" Katherine shook her head. \"Out of the question.\" \"Suit yourself, then.\" The doctor smirked, walking towards the door. \"I win either way. Whether Savannah stays or not, I get stronger.\" \"What if we save everyone?\" Katherine countered. \"That, my dear, is simply not possible.\" He pulled the double doors shut.[Chapter 6] The Mayor, his pants legs catching on every burr and weed as he walked, began the long trek through the town to rally the citizens and eventually drag them to the spooky mansion where the Maestro lived. He peered through a random window, his dark eyes shifting. It was a 50's style diner, and a waitress carrying a plate saw him and shrieked. This, being precisely the sort of entrance he wanted, allowed him to open the door and waddle up to the counter. Having heard the waitress scream, the manager glanced towards the thundering Mayor and immediately ducked into a cubby space, knocking down several pots, pans, and dishes as he went. \"Mister Beze!\" The Mayor roared. \"I'd like to have a word with you!\" The manager, quaking in his boots, stammered a reply. \"I-I-I'm afraid I can't, sir.\" He looked over the edge, seeing the manager's hiding spot. \"Why not?\" \"You came in here mad. Tha-tha-that ain't a good sign.\" He shook his head vigorously, rocking back in forth in a fetal position. The waitress who had screamed began fumbling around in the kitchen, swearing loudly. She eventually came out and glared at the Mayor, her hands on her hips. \"This better be important. You didn't have to scare me half to death like that.\" A few customers were peeking around their booths, listening in. The Mayor nodded at them all. \"Good. I've got a proper audience.\" He dragged a chair up and sat down. \"Folks, my daughter's gone missing.\" There were several gasps and hushed whispers. He held up his meaty hands for silence. \"I know what you're probably thinking. I haven't called the police, because I already know where she is.\" \"Then why are you tellin' us?\" The waitress demanded. \"Because the Maestro took her.\" Silence. The few who could remember their last hike up to Someplace Else exchanged glances. They all knew what this meant. Still hiding, Mr. Beze said, \"I-I aint goin' back up there!\" \"Coward.\" The Mayor muttered. \"There's nothing wrong with being a coward…\" He whirled around. \"Mrs. Dade-Pat, please. It's for my daughter.\" The blonde woman who had spoken only shook her head. \"It's too dangerous. Remember what happened last time?\" Severla patrons nodded in agreement. One boy (who had mysteriously not grown older in the sixteen years since he had met Maestro) piped up. \"But he's nice! He wouldn't hurt anybody.\" \"Listen, son.\" The Mayor pointed at him with a sausage finger. \"My daughter is trapped up there with that monster. I told you all the truth about him last time, but you didn't believe me. Now he's taken my little girl, and none of you care!\" A hush fell upon the crowd. People began to shift nervously in their seats, and a few got up and left. A hip youth said, \"Man, why you gotta lay this stuff on us? D'ya really think firin' up the same grill as last time is gonna solve this detective junk, brotha?\" \"Hip youth,\" the Mayor began in a humble voice, \"you have no say in these matters.\" The hip youth got up from his seat, muttering, \"This some bullshit…\" and walked out, taking everyone who still remained's resolve with him. Which was about twenty people, including the waitress and Mr. Beze. \"Will you good people come with me and take care of this problem, once and for all?\" The Mayor asked, puffing up his chest valiantly. Mr. Beze slowly stood up-then slogged over. \"I guess so, sir…\" With that, the Mayor gestured out the door, yelling, \"ONWARD!\"[Chapter 7] I walked downstairs and waited around the corner for Maestro to come down. It takes two hours, but he eventually does. One the last step I jump out and launch myself at him, wrapping my arms around him like a constrictor snake. \"I love you!\" I scream at the top of my lungs. \"Please don't make me go home!\" The sun is rising, and I have clairvoyance enough to know that my dad is coming with a mob. Maestro looks bewildered. \"Um… what?\" \"My dad, the Mayor, is coming to take me away. I can fight him off with my powers!\" I keep screaming even though I'm sure he can hear me. \"I don't wanna go back! Let me stay here with you! Pleeeaaaaseeee!\" He pries my arms off. \"Calm down. Why don't you want to go home?\" \"My dad's a fatty and he wants me to be normal! Plus, he makes me go to the Super Fun Rock Band Church!\" \"The what?\" \"Hell in a handbasket!\" \"Will you stop yelling?!\" He shouts. \"I sorry,\" I murmur. \"But I still don't want to go. Nobody understands me but you.\" \"I barely know you. All you did was waltz into my house, and now you're refusing to leave.\" He runs a hand through his long black curls, hanging at shoulder length like so many coils and spirals of midnight-ahem. Moving on. \"I wish you had never come here. You've only caused trouble, and now you're acting like a spoiled, selfish br-\" \"White people and black people don't have actually black hair. Only Asians do.\" I interrupt him. He looks at me so severely I burst into tears. \"I can't help being weird! I have OCD, ADD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression!\" \"Self-diagnosed?\" \"Of course!\" He sighs, shutting his eyes. His eyelashes look sooooo pretty. I wish mine were like that. \"Look. I don't love you. I don't even really like you. Your father is coming here because he obviously cares about you. If you don't leave with him, and he tries to run me out of town again, I will personally kill you. Understand?\" I shake my head. \"You won't kill me. You couldn't even kill a bug onstage.\" \"Onstage?\" \"Never mind. I can use my powers to defeat the Mayor, like I said. He won't run you out of town.\" He rubs his forehead, cringing as he realizes he's running out of options. \"Look, if I let you stay here, will you bring the ghost back from… wherever you sent her?\" \"Development hell?\" I think for a moment. \"I don't wanna.\" \"Then out you go.\" He says, pointing towards the door. \"Okay, okay!\" I hold up my hands. \"You said she wasn't your girlfriend?\" \"She's dead. Ghosts don't work that way.\" I pout, but he only gestures at the door again. \"Fine!\" I stamp my foot and disappear in a puff of smoke. \"Rasputin, you got any eights?\" \"Go fish, duchess.\" In the middle of a desert landscape, five people sat playing cards. One was a teenaged girl in a pearly white dress, another a bearded man with creepy eyes. The third was a strange human-like creature with white eyes, the fourth a woman wearing a fedora, and the fifth was a bored young woman with blue eyes and rope marks on her neck. The bearded creep asked the fedora-sporting woman, \"Michelle, do you have any queens?\" \"Nope. Go fish.\" A blinding flash of light interrupted their game, and Savannah appeared. For some reason, her hair had turned purple. The girl called duchess asked, \"What happened to your hair?\" \"In this dimension, it's purple.\" Savannah replied. She pointed to the bored woman. \"I have to take you back now.\" \"Really?\" She replied, then made a comical face. \"About time.\" She flung down her cards and stood up. Michelle stuck out her tongue, while Rasputin began cursing at her in Russian. Blowing them off, the ghost and Savannah disappeared. Poof! We got back. Maestro blinked. \"That was fast.\" \"We were playing Go Fish.\" The ghost, Wendy, mutters. \"Hey, did you get my present?\" \"What prese-\" Maestro began. His eyes widen, then darken. \"The blood was your fault, wasn't it?\" Wendy, stuffing toilet paper into her cheeks, replies, \"I made 'em an offer 'e coudn't refuse.\" She turns to me. \"What'd you do wif the 'orse 'ead?\" \"I ate it.\" I answer with a completely straight face. \"Like a good doggie.\" \"Enough with the movie references.\" Maestro says, waving his hands around. Wendy promptly spits out the toilet paper. \"We have the mayor to worry about. What 'powers' are you going to use to get rid of him?\" \"Avada cadavra?\" Maestro looks like he was on the verge of exploding. \"I said no more references!\" He points at me. \"I will not let you kill your own father. That's out of the question.\" \"You know about Harry Potter?\" \"I don't care about Harry Potter. This is real life.\" \"Actually, it's not.\" Wendy points out. \"In real life, you're dead and she's a Mary Sue.\" \"It doesn't matter. You can't kill him.\" \"I thought you hated him, too!\" I protest. \"Not enough to commit murder!\" He shakes his head. \"Oh, for crying out loud-why can't you just go home? I don't want you here!\" He holds out his hands, which are shaking uncontrollably from nerves. \"Why do you have to stay here? Why can't you go somewhere else?\" \"Because my powers only work here. And I don't want to give them up.\"[Chapter 8] As the Mayor and his gang of reluctant townsfolk marched up to the mansion, there occurred several incidents, ranging between bizarre, to humorous, to downright scary (and sometimes all three). The first of these was quite mild. In the center of the path was a bizarre streak of light that stretched from one dead/dying bush to another. It was blue, and looked suspiciously like a bad Hollywood special effect. Upon seeing it, the crowd slowed to a stop. The Mayor stared at the light for a few seconds, then said, \"What the hell is this?\" To his surprise, the light responded: \"My name is Shaniqua.\" \"Hi Shaniqua!\" Shouted the town idiot from the back. The Mayor shrugged. \"Will you let us pass? We're in a bit of a hurry.\" \"Can I have some cornbread first?\" Asked the cheap SFX. Luckily, one of the local housewives happened to carry a bit of cornbread on her person at all times, and the crowd was able to continue. The second incident occurred ten minutes later, when the town drunk became separated from the group and wandered off on his own. He eventually came to a stream and sat down on a rock to have a beer, only to hear a raspy voice say, \"Hey, Bob! There's a guy over there!\" followed by a coughing fit. The drunk turned around and saw a tree that appeared to have grown around a skeletal man, or possibly out of his head until it covered his whole body and rooted him to the ground. The creature's eyes were popping out and as yellowed as liver damage, and he did not look like he was in a very comfortable position. \"Aw, don't look so surprised, kid.\" The tree-man went on, seeing the drunk's stunned expression. \"You live in a town with a literal name that perfectly describes the residents and a cardboard cutout Evil Establishment, where a magical man livin' in an old mansion has the power to summon ghouls, but chooses to spend his time and resources doing elaborately choreographed dances to entertain snot-nosed punks. I'm not so bad, once you get to know me and Bob.\" He coughed again. \"The name's Harold. Could you do me a favor?\" The drunk, lapsing into a state of shock, shrugged placidly. Harold went on. \"I've been feelin' a little spread out lately. I think Bob here-the tree-has been movin' around my organs over the years. I think my heart's somewhere in my roots. If you could go down and stop my heart, that'd be great.\" \"You want me to murder you?\" Asked the drunk, still impassive. \"Well, I wouldn't put it that way…\" Harold coughed, gasping for breath. \"You'd just be doin' me a favor. I don't like being stuck here, and the only way for me to get out of this mess is to kill me. Now, are you gonna do it or what?\" The drunk looked down at his beer. \"Sweet Lord, I'll never drink again.\" He said, before promptly running away, never to be seen again. \"So much for that, eh Bob?\" Harold chuckled. Lastly, the final incident involved the three never-aging adorable moppets, Trevor, Timmy, and Token Black Kid. As to why there only seems to be boys in this town but no girls, is a mystery. Anyway, the three lads encountered what appeared to be a claymation, fashioned into a suit of armor holding an emotive, shapeshifting white mask thing. \"What are you?\" Asked young Timmy, earning him a smack across the head from his older brother. The mask replied, in a voice like schizophrenia, \"An angel.\" \"What's your name?\" In response, the mask morphed half of his face into a grotesque shape. \"Satan.\" \"Uh oh.\" Said the Token. \"What's the matter?\" Asked Satan. \"Nothing.\" Trevor cut in nervously. \"Its just a sorry name for an angel.\" Satan proceeded to take them on a magical adventure, giving them their favorite fruits and allowing them to populate a small-scale kingdom of clay people. However, the whole thing turned sour when Satan got pissed at the clay folk, who had began fighting over a cow, and destroyed the city, uttering an allegorical message about how humanity is only a single thought in God's mind or something like that. The kids ran away screaming before he could finish, and were thus traumatized into growing up again. In other words, there will be no more sequels. At last, the crowd (mostly) made it to Someplace Else in one piece. \"Why can't we just leave him alone?\" Asked the Token Black Kid, as the tired group was forced to rehash the first movie's dialogue. Timmy piped up. \"Yeah, he hasn't hurt anybody!\" \"It's your fault, jerk. You just couldn't keep your mouth shut!\" Trevor said, smacking Timmy again. Their mother smacked him. \"He did the right thing.\" \"There's no such thing as ghosts, honey.\" Said Token Black Kid's mom. \"I'm gonna prove it to ya, kid.\" The Mayor said. \"C'mon-let's go.\"[Chapter 9] \"Hi Dad.\" The Mayor looks at me in shock. \"Savannah! I've been looking all over for you!\" I doubt it, but I force a smile. \"Um, yeah. I just decided to stay here for a while…\" He tries to give me a hug. \"I was so worried! What happened? Did he do anything to you?\" \"No! Of course not!\" I yell, making him jump. \"I came up here on my own. Well, actually, this girl dared me to come here, and the Maestro pulled me in, but I fell in love with him and decided to stay.\" My dad stares at me in shock. I stamp the toe of my shoe, rubbing it in the dusty wood floor, trying to look as innocent and angelic as possible. He just keeps staring at me. \"Why… How could you possibly…\" Even the people in the mob behind him look confused, or they're shaking their heads in disbelief. A few of the kids are giggling. \"Stop it!\" I scream, and they go all serious. \"Savannah, sweetheart, are you sure you're okay?\" My dad asks, looking more and more worried. \"You're only fifteen, and the Maestro is…\" \"I probably have Stockholm syndrome.\" I admit. \"But I still love him.\" \"Why?\" \"Because he's cute.\" Someone snorts in the back-but a few of the housewives in front are nodding their heads in agreement. That is beyond creepy, but whatever. \"Honey, you can't say you're in love with someone just because of how they look.\" \"I don't care. He understands me. Unlike you.\" I feel my anger starting to bubble over. \"You never even tried to understand me. You just wanted to be normal and boring, like everybody else!\" \"Savannah Chastity Cook,\" he says my full name, straightening, \"you hurt people. You're violent and loud and obnoxious. That's why you don't have any friends. That's why people don't understand you. They can't understand a sociopath!\" He looks genuinely tired, hurt, and upset. \"Why do you think I devoted so much time to trying to make things normal? Because of you, Savannah. Because you need help. You can't live your life like this. It's not right.\" I'm so mad, I feel like my head is going to explode. Instead, I burst into tears and run further into the house. The mob starts following me, encouraged by the Mayor. I run and run, until I throw open the nearest door and discover the room happens to be occupied by Maestro, who I slam into, knocking him down. The crowd reaches us, and a few of the kids start cheering. Maestro looks at me murderously, only to see the Mayor's angry face and scramble to his feet. Since I'm clinging to his shoulders, he drags me up with him. \"So,\" the Mayor growls, \"we meet again, Maestro.\" Maestro makes a face that looks like a cross between a nervous grin and a grimace of disgust. I'm too busy trying to find his heartbeat to calm me down to care. \"So we do.\" \"Well, freaky-boy, do you have anything to say about all this?\" He gestures at the house. \"Uh…\" Maestro looks up, then down, then left to right. I can tell by his eyes that he's realizing he can't risk telling the truth, for his dead girlfriend's sake, and has to play along. \"...No, I'm afraid not.\" As an afterthought, he awkwardly returns my embrace. I squeal a little. The Mayor shakes his head. \"I was hoping this would all turn out to be some sort of misunderstanding. A shame.\" He looks back at the townspeople. \"Looks like we're gonna have to hurt you.\" \"Now, let's not be too hasty.\" Maestro says quickly, holding up one hand. He takes a precautionary step back anyway. \"I'm sure we can come to an agreement here. After all, your daughter really just doesn't like you, specifically. That's why she refuses to go home.\" \"Why would she refuse to come home, anyway?\" The Mayor pauses, his expression incredulous. \"I have all her crap there. This place doesn't even have running water. I had them cut it off three weeks ago!\" \"Wait-that was your fault?\" Maestro asks. \"Why would you do that?\" \"Because I'm an asshole.\" The Mayor chuckles. \"Anyway, I'm still working on getting this place torn down. Probably with you inside it. You wouldn't want that, would you, Savannah?\" \"The board wouldn't let you tear Someplace Else down!\" I screech. \"Would they? After all, I'm the Mayor.\" He flashes a toothy smile. I stamp my foot. \"No! You can't do that!\" My eyes start glowing. Wind swirls around the room from nowhere. Maestro lets go of me and ducks behind an old sofa as I raise my arms, preparing to summon the dark forces. \"Leave… me… ALONE!\" I scream, as the windows smash and people start getting blown away like that one scene in Mary Poppins. The Mayor fights hardest of all, grabbing onto the edge of the doorway. For some reason, the song \"Leave Me Alone\" from Bad starts playing, even though it technically shouldn't exist in this universe. \"Savannah! Stop!\" My dad shouts over the wind. \"STTOOOOOOOOOPPPPP!\" He tries to reenact the scene from the first movie, and winds up throwing his arms back-losing his grip and going tumbling through the glass of a window I left untouched just so I could smash him through it. Then, everything stops: the wind, the glowing eyes, everything. Maestro slowly raises his head. \"Whoa. You didn't kill him, right?\" \"No. But he's probably a paraplegic.\" I don't feel so good. \"Maestro, quick… catch me!\" I fall in a faint. He doesn't so much as move to break my fall, and I groan, landing on my back wrong. \"Ow.\" I say, then looks up at him pitifully. \"Maestro, I'm… dyyiiingggg.\" I stretch the word out, warbling. He stares at me. \"You're kidding.\" \"No, for real.\" I lay the back of my hand over my forehead dramatically. \"The strain… was too much…\" All the color starts draining out my face, making me all pretty and ghost-white. I reach for him. \"Kiss me one last time, my love…\" \"We never kissed before.\" He says, leaning against the old couch. His mouth keeps trying to twist into a smile of pure delight as I lay dying on the floor, though he tries to hide it. \"No thanks, kid. You're too young for me.\" With a sigh, I breathe my last breath, eyes fluttering closed as I float off into oblivion. A few minutes later, Wendy opened the door. It was loose on the hinges after the windstorm, and she had to hoist it back into place. Then, she turned around and saw the lifeless body of Savannah sprawled across the floor. \"Damn.\" She said. \"That was one wacky adventure.\" She met Maestro's eyes. The two stared at each other for a while, each fighting the urge to break into hysterical laughter, until Wendy reached out, scream-singing, \"Ding dong, the witch is dead!\" And the two of them locked arms and danced around singing together beside the corpse, until Katherine walked in. \"Don't you two think this is all a little… insensitive?\" \"To who?\" Maestro asked, laughing. \"All she caused was trouble. Now, she won't ever bother us again!\" They went on cavorting until, breathless, they each sank down on a chair. \"Y'know, I do feel kind of bad about the Mayor. Paraplegia doesn't sound fun, not to mention losing your daughter on top of that.\" Maestro murmured. \"She wasn't his real daughter.\" Wendy pointed out. \"Her mother was a witch from another dimension who sent her to Earth for no specific reason. Was somebody chasing them? Who? Why? How did they get here? Why does it take them 15-20 years just to find them, when it's pretty obvious, since Earth is the only other place in the universe that they know of with the means to sustain life? Even if there were more planets, wouldn't they have started with the one they knew the least about, since that would be the most likely place to hide fugitives? And if her friend or stepmother or whoever was really one of the bad guys spying on them, why did they wait for so long to capture them? Why do they want to capture/kill a helpless baby anyway? Does it have some sort of power that only shows up when they reach maturity? If so, why? How do they know they even have the power? Can they sense it, like the Force or something? How would killing them/their mother work in their favor? How do they know killing the mother won't cause the kid to become evil and turn on them? What if killing them is the only way to keep a bunch of innocent people from dying? Why would you send them to Earth to lead humanity, but if you didn't send them in the first place, they wouldn't need to be protected or whatever in the first place? Why do these stories have to be so convoluted, contrived, and complicated?\" Maestro and Katherine stared at her, completely lost. She shook her head. \"I should just make my own damned fanfic…\" THE END. ALTERNATE ENDING: \"I should just make my own damned fanfic…\" Suddenly! There was an explosion behind them. They all turned and gasped. Doctor Maestro stood in the gaping hole left behind by the blast. His fists and eyes glowed with energy. \"Ah, there you are.\" He said, grinning. \"Did you really think it would be that easy? I told you I would win either way.\" He held up his hands. \"Now, I have her powers-enough to get rid of you.\" He glared at Maestro, who looked beyond confused. The doctor used telekinesis to knock him against the wall, and the Maestro snapped out of it. His own eyes started glowing, and he blasted him with ectoplasm. The battle went on unnecessarily for forty minutes, completely leveling most of Normal Valley in the process. There was punching, kicking, slamming, jumping, explosions, and other testosterone-fueled idiocy before the audience was brought to a moment they could actually sort of care about-Doctor Maestro killing a dog and throwing a car through Someplace Else, before Maestro pummeled him into a crater and revealed what should have been obvious: one can't exist without the other. He then went back to Katherine, who was looking at the hole where the car had gone through the roof. \"These things can be replaced.\" She said with a sigh. \"But not people.\" Maestro agreed. \"You mean like those thousands of people in the town that you just destroyed?\" She asked. As if to prove her point, a survivor, his clothes burnt and torn, came running down the street, screaming, \"Run for your lives!\" as another building collapsed, sending more falling in a domino effect while ashes rained from the sky. \"Uh... I have to go now.\" Maestro said, promptly running in the other direction, never to be seen or heard from again.

Itrnhad also been five years since the last time he'd seen her, true they had keptrnin touch through mail but it wasn't enough for him, he yearned to see her. Hernhad kept her informed about his travels and his search for the gospel, whichrnhad led him back to Belo Quinto. Father Alameda had left a series of letters in dozens of different languagesrnthat were clues to the exact location of the fifth gospel. Andrew had a ratherrneasy time with all but one of the letters, the last one, which had been writtenrnentirely in Aramaic. After each translated letter he followed the directions tornthe next letter, he followed the letters for two long years. Finally with allrnthe letters translated he arrived at the treasured destination, back at thernvery church where Father had been buried. Near the bleeding statue, a smallrnpanel in the floor had been removed and that is where Andrew had found thernfifth gospel with the complete translation written in English in a journal keptrnby Father. Now after those five years of searching, translating, and fighting for therngospel to be accepted by thernrnVatican,rnhis efforts were rewarded and now his work for the church was finished. He onlyrnhoped that all this was not for nothing, he finally felt that Father Alamedarncould rest now and his time as a priest had come to an end. Now his thoughtsrnonly drifted back to Frankie. In her letters he followed her life through troublesome men that didn'trndeserve he love and in the end broke her heart, and the pain of her motherrnpassing away in a freak plane accident. All the things that he wished he couldrnhave been there to prevent or been there to help her through. In her lastrnletter she expressed her grief about the fact that they could never be togetherrnas anything but friends, her feelings for him ran deeper than those for anyonernshe'd ever met. She never felt this way, but she understood that she needed tornmove on with her life. He remembered the first time he had met her; he had gone to her place ofrnemployment to coax her into explaining about the attacks she'd experienced. Shernhad insisted that he had to get a hair cut first before she would talk to him.rnHe asked her if he could call her Frankie and her response to that was,\" andrnwhat I should call you, I have a hard time calling someone I'd date, Father.\"rnThat's when his infatuation began, everything about this creature wasrnexhilarating, her lust for life intoxicating, her movements graceful as arnballerina, and yet her passion unmatched by anything he'd ever seen. He'drnstayed with her for two months while she was recuperating from her encounterrnwith the stigmata; those had been the happiest months of his life, and makingrnhim regret the choices he'd made in his life. He wanted to be there for her, to be the one she could give and receive lovernfrom. He wanted to protect her from the pain of life, and now finally he hopedrnhis chance had come. He was returning to her, hoping to surprise her at herrnwork. He'd already called ahead to warn Donna about him arriving and asked ifrnFrankie worked on the day he got in. Somewhat reluctant in her answer, shernassured him she would be working but was leaving earlier for personal reasons.rnHis heart had leaped into his throat with the thought of seeing her again. He landed at four o'clock, Tuesday afternoon, he was angry because it was anrnhour later than he had planned and was worried that he had missed surprisingrnher at work. He finally arrived at the beauty shop at a little after five, duernto a horrific accident five miles down the road from the airport. His fears hadrncome true; he had missed her by more than a half hour. When he walked into thernshop he greeted Donna with a loving welcome, as he hugged her he tried to dornhis catch up scene in a matter of minutes, \"Hello Donna, how have you been?\" \"Good, look at you,\" she says as she circles him, \"all big and importantrnnow, what are you doing back here? I was very surprised to hear from you.\" He continued their talk and was hoping to get some information on howrnFrankie had been, and more importantly if she stilled lived at the same place.rn\"So how has Frankie been, is she doing alright?\" A little bewildered at the question, she took a step back and tried tornignore the question, \"So how long are you going to be in town?\" She asked asrnshe turned back to the customer hair she had been working with. \"I'm hoping it will be a permanent move,rnrnRome has been missing something,\" he hintedrnat as he stared blankly at what was Frankie's station. Now he was becomingrnanxious and extremely worried he would be not be able to get any information onrnwhere Frankie was. \"So where can I…\" Before he could even get the question out Donna knew just what the answerrnwould be, \"Yes, she's doing fine, Yes, she still lives at the same apartment,rnYes, she's probably at home right now.\" With frustration in her voice shernstarted to pace around the room, \"But I don't think it's a good idea to go seernher, she's finally moving on with her life, getting over the horrible pastrnshe's had. I think that her seeing you will make her have a relapse, andrnfrankly Andrew she doesn't need that.\" \"But I…\" He wasn't even able to get out a full sentence before she beganrnagain. \"I know you care about her, but as long as you both live the lives you do,rnall you can do is hurt her,\" She turned and faced him, staring at him withrnpleading eyes. \"Just let her go, let her move on. If you really care about her,rnyou'll let her move on.\" Frightened and frustrated he began to head for the door, not quiet sure whatrnhe was going to do, or even where he was going to go. His mind was racing andrnas he opened the door to exit, at that moment he stopped and took a deeprnbreathes to compose his thoughts. Donna wanted to make sure he knew she wasrnserious and reiterated what she had said before, \"As long as you live the livesrnyou do, all you can do is hurt her.\" (The song \"Love by Grace\" by Lara Fabian begins to play through his walk) \"I know,\" he replied to her and with that he exited the shop and turned leftrnto head towards his hotel room, although it was also the direction of herrnapartment. He knew this path all too well, he knew it took exactly 12 min. tornget from her work to her house by walking, he hoped it would be long enough forrnhim to figure out exactly what to do. His whole mind blanked as he began tornthink of her, and about what Donna had said. ' No, she didn't know what shernwas talking about' , he said aloud in his mind, ' I didn't have enoughrntime to explain about my situation. Beside, I'm not the same manrnshe once knew; I can be the man Frankie needs'. He told himself as hernstopped in front on her building, unsure of what exactly to do. He didn't knowrnwhat to say or how to approach this situation, he figured Donna had calledrnahead to warn her of his arrival. So he figured he'd do the only thing that wasrnreasonable and ring her, ' what could it harm' , he thought,' his wholernsurprise had been ruined'. He figured the best thing to do was try tornsalvage some of this trip. He approached the door and rang the button the said Paige; he didn't have tornwait long. \"Come on up,\" she stated and then the door buzzed, he was alarmed byrnnot only how fast the reply came but also her warm reception. ' Maybe thisrnwasn't such a bad idea', he thought as he entered the door and headed uprnthe stairs. Now was his moment of panic, ' what if Donna was right? What ifrnall I do is hurt her? What if all of this is just a big mistake?' It wasrntoo late to worry about that now; he had reached her door that was ajar. Hernknocked on the door, as gentlemen do, only to hear her response from inside. \"Hey, come on in, I'll be done in a few minutes,\" she yelled as she passedrnby the door heading towards the room which he knew was her bedroom. Althoughrnshocked he entered her room and stood quietly next to the door.[Chapter 2] Hernjust stood there; barely past the door.xa0rnHe didn't know what to do or even how to react; all he could do wasrnwatch her run from bedroom to bathroom in a hurried attempt at completing herrnattire.xa0 She hadn't even stopped tornwelcome him but that didn't bother him, he was content with being able to seernher again. \"Sorry!xa0 I'm just trying to finish my hair,\" shernexclaimed from the bathroom as she passed by the door.xa0 Herself being a hairdresser; her hair had tornbe perfect with no string of hair out of place. Althoughrnhe had only got a glance of her, he took in all that he saw.xa0 She was adorning a beautiful, silver,rniridescent top with a cow neck that hung down extremely low and it formed tornher body perfectly, it was connected in the back by a single silver string.xa0 To accentuate her top she was also wearing anrnankle length, pitch black skirt that was slit from top to bottom, and looked tornonly be held together by a single silver loop.xa0rn(Undoubtedly the other side was a carbon copy of the other.)xa0 Although she said she hadn't finished withrnher hair, he could tell she planned an up do with a small amount of hairsrnhanging down around her face.xa0 To finishrnoff her ensemble her delicate feet, where once stigmata punctures had been, nowrnwere wearing silver stilettos. The shoes themselves added that touch of classicrnelegance, even though she hadn't needed it.xa0rnWhen she finally emerged from the bathroom, she was struggling with thernclasp to her diamond, teardrop necklace. \"Ok,\"rnshe said as she finished with the clasp and flattened out a wrinkle in herrnskirt, \"How do I….\" She said then suddenly stopped as she looked up andrnrecognized just who was in her apartment. Allrneither one could do was to stare at the wonder they were beholding, he wasrnunable to decipher what she was thinking.xa0rnHer angelic face gave him no help as it remained expressionless.xa0 After what seemed like an eternity Andrew wasrnthe first to muster up enough courage to speak, sheepishly taking a steprnforward, \"Hello Frankie.\"xa0 His kind voicernmust have finally sunk in to her, he mouth formed a beautiful smile and she ranrnat him practically tackling him in the process.xa0rnWhen she hugged him they both fell to the floor, their laughter filledrnthe room, and suddenly Frankie stopped laughing and got up. \"Irnam so sorry, I didn't mean to do that,\" she stood up and fixed her skirt, \"Irnwas so excited and I got ahead of myself.\"xa0rnShe extended her hand to him to help him up, \"I just haven't seen you inrnsuch a long time, what are you doing here?xa0rnI thought you had important church things to do?\" \"Irnfinished those things, and I came back to see you. How have you been?\" hernquestioned as they hugged again. Justrnthen a young man opened the door, \"Frankie, Hon, come on we're going to bernlate,\" he stopped when he saw the two hugging.xa0rn\"Umm, what's going on here?\"[Chapter 3] \"Uh, Frankie; what the hell is goingrnon here, who is this guy?\" the man questioned a second time as she pulled awayrnfrom Andrew. \"Oh God, Honey I'm sorry,\" shernsauntered over and grabbed him by the arm guiding him toward Andrew. \" Andrew,rnthis is Keech Vranch; he's my fiancée.\" Reeling from the shock of the wordrnfiancée, all Andrew could do was stare in amazement at his Frankie,rnbetrothed to another.xa0 It was as thoughrnhis mind had temporarily shut down and his vision was completely narrowed downrnso that all he could see was the couple that stood in front of him.xa0 Finally it was Frankie's voice that broughtrnhim back to the present, \"And Keech, this is Father Andrew Kiernan,\" sherngingerly turned her head to get a better look at Andrew, \"he is the priest thatrnhelped me with my sickness a few years back.\" Now beginning to understand, Keechrnextended his hand to Andrew in a gesture of acceptance, \"Ahh, Father KiernanrnI've heard so much about you, definitely a pleasure to meet the man who savedrnFrankie's life.\" \"Nice to make your acquaintance too,rnKeech,\" Frankie was sure susceptible to the outside appearances. Keech lookedrnto be about six ft six in. or more, well built, he also had a very darkrncomplexion he looked as if he were of Italian descent.xa0 He couldn't have been older than 25 andrnAndrew was no comparison to this marvel man in front of him, the man that wasrnholding the arm of the woman he loved making his possession of Frankie quiternclear. \"Oh, I forgot my purse and coat,rnI'll just be a minute,\" she turned to head towards her bedroom, \"Hey Andrew,rnhere.\"xa0 She handed him an envelope and arnpencil, \"Write down your number and address so I can get a hold of you.\"xa0 At that moment she returned to the task shernhad before set out to accomplish, followed closely by Keech.xa0 Once they were out of sight, he heard Keechrnbegin his harassment. \"What the hell? Are you that big ofrna whore; that you're trying to get some ass from a priest, first that guy atrnthe bar the other night and now this\" Keech whispered in a harsh voice as herngrabbed her arm. \"He's my friend and I haven't seenrnhim in five years, I can't hug him?\" she started to tear up from the pain ofrnhis grip and all the emotions running through her mind. \"Please! Don't feed me thatrnbullshit, he could barely take his eyes of you,\" pulling her towards herrnmirror.xa0 \"This outfit certainly doesn'trnhelp, look at you; I've seen hookers with more clothing on.\" Andrew was becoming furious, howrndare he talk to her like that; what could she see in this pathetic excuse of arnman . All he could do was pace back and forth, \"Is everything alright inrnthere?\" \"Yeah, everything is fine,\" shernheaded towards her closet, \"I'll change just give me a minute.\" \"No, we don't have enough time,\" hernpicked up her coat and purse, \"You'll just have to look like the slut you are:rnnow lets go.\" As Frankie whipped the single tear that had fell on her cheek thernhappy couple put on a smile and re-entered the living room. Keech placedrnFrankie's coat over her shoulders, \"Ready Hon, we're going to be late.\" \"Yeah, lets go. Did you write yourrnaddress down,\" she questioned Andrew those pleading eyes of hers locked on his. \"Yes, here you are.\" He adjusted thernlapel on her coat to lay straight and pulled her close to hug her.xa0 \"I'm here whenever you need me,\" he quietlyrnwhispered in her ear, she then followed Keech out the door. Andrew followedrnclosely behind the couple. **********(Overrnthe next few parts I'll be using a lot of songs from different artists. Thernsongs will be appropriately titled, the songs help explain not only the moodrnbut also his thoughts and feelings. I hope I make it easy for you tornfollow.)********************************************** (Songrnbegins playing softly in the background I want to be the one byrnLonestar) All he could do was watch the couplernexit the building, there went his heart and soul exiting on the arm of anotherrnman. A man who didn't deserve her love, who just in the short time he was herernhad made Andrew hate him with anger he'd only felt once before in his life.xa0 He just left the building letting his mindrnwonder wherever it wanted to, What was I thinking, that after all this timernshe'd just be sitting around by herself. He turned to catch one lastrnglimpse of her; his heart broke for her.xa0rnShe was always so trusting of men, all they had to do was whisper somernsweet words, be kind to her and she would fall for them like they were the onlyrnmen in the world.xa0 His mind was facing arnpurgatory like he had never felt before, hoping to pick up something to helprnhis pain he stopped at the local convenience store to pick up a case of beer. As he entered his hotel he placedrnthe case into the fridge, all he could think about was his need to relax andrntry to forget everything that had happened today he figured that a nice hotrnshower would calm him. Yet before he headed into the shower he called andrnordered room service, Time to start relaxing , he thought as he headedrninto the bathroom. Andrew had barely gotten undressedrnbefore he heard the phone ring in the other room, \"Shit,\" he yelled as herngrabbed a towel and raced to the phone. He quickly picked up the phone andrnanswered as he wrapped the towel around him, \"Hello?\" his heart leaped at thernidea of hearing her voice again. \"Father Kiernan, Hey this isrnKeech; Frankie's fiancée.\" \"Yes, is everything alright?\"rnAndrew was frightened that something had happened to Frankie.[Chapter 4] \"Oh yeah,rneverything is fine; Frankie had to leave the table for a little, and so I haverna favor to ask you.\" He has a favorrnto ask me, the irony in that is amazing; his mind was racing, \"What kind ofrnfavor do you need?\" \"I want tornsurprise Frankie, the whole night we've been talking about our wedding and I'drnlike to surprise her: tomorrow night at her place around 8:00, I want you tornmarry us.\" Without evenrnletting the thought process in his head he replied, \"Why me?\" \"Well umm, becausernFrankie has been talking about you all night, and I figured she'd want yournthere and this would kill two birds with one stone,\" his voice was so cheerfulrnand snide. (Come What May byrnEwan McGregor from Moulin Rouge plays softly) Just at that moment the steady patter of rain caughtrnhis attention, it was raining on the day he left her five years ago.xa0 Andrew just stood there watching the rainrnslowly fall on the sliding glass door to the balcony. \"Andrew; so whatrndo you say?\" \"No,\" he quicklyrnreplied, \"No I'm sorry I can't do it.\" Agitated Keechrnquestioned him, \"Why not!?! You're going to be invited anyways and this willrnhelp us cut cost on the wedding.\" \"I'm sorry Keech,rnI can not do it.\" \"That isn't arnreason, why won't you do this for us,\" Keech was furious, he was practicallyrnscreaming into the phone. \"Because I'm not arnpriest, alright!\" Andrew had lost his temper and surrendered his secret to thernlast person he wanted to know. \"What the hell,rnwhat is going on here,\" with that last remark he hung up the phone.xa0 Andrew just stood there for a momentrnpondering what had just happened, the phone next to his ear was pulsating withrnthe dial tone. Slowly he hung up the phone, what a nightmare this wholernthing is turning out to be. He returned to the bathroom and began hisrnshower; he just stood there for a long while letting the hot water pound on hisrnhead and letting it roll down his body. I need to stop living a lie, she mayrnbe in a bad relationship but she loves him, I can't change that. He just thought about her the whole time,rnabout everything they did together; the first night after she was cured whenrnthey just laid together in her bed, they laid there for what seemed like hoursrnjust holding each other like it was the last time they would be together. Therntimes when they went out to dinners and movies just things to help her get backrnto her normal life, she said it helped having him around, she felt safer withrnhim there. Suddenly he heard a loud knocking on the front door, \"Oh shit thernpizza!\" he quickly again ran out of the shower grabbing his towel and wrappingrnit around him, \"I'll be there in a second.\" He grabbed hisrnwallet from the desk and ran to the door, \"Ok, I'm coming,\" he slowly openedrnthe door, \" Sorry I just got out of the show…\" his eyes could not believe whatrnthey were seeing. There in front of him stood a completely drenched andrnshivering Frankie, her beautiful outfit and hair soaked, even with the rain herncould see her red puffy eyes were crying. \"Why didn't yourntell me?\" she said in a quiet whisper, Andrew was barely able to hear her. Sherncouldn't even make eye contact with him she just kept looking at the floor; sherncould hardly keep herself from breaking down right in front of him. \"Frankie, what'srnwrong?\" he was trying to make eye contact with her and he wondered what hadrnhappened in that short time since he talked to Keech and the moment he openedrnup the door. \"WHY DIDN'T YOUrnTELL ME!\" she was practically hysterical, she had screamed at the top of herrnlungs and started crying even harder. Just as the pizza guy walked up, \" Uh,rnpizza for a mister Andrew Kiernan?\" the boy didn't know what to do so he justrnstood there. Andrew reached torngrab Frankie by the arm, \"Come here,\" but she pulled away from him and enteredrnhis room. \"Don't touch me,\"rnshe slowly stumbled into the room kicking off her shoes. \"Umm sir, that'llrnbe ten bucks plus tip,\" gingerly the boy stood in the hallway trying to figurernout what was going on. \"Here,\" Andrewrngrabbed a twenty out of his wallet and gave it to the boy then grabbing thernpizza and slamming the door on him. \"Thanks,\" the boy yelled as he left downrnthe corridor. Frankie just stoodrnthere not making any movement and the only sound she made was a soft whimper asrnshe struggled to compose herself.xa0rnAndrew placed the pizza on the table then went and grabbed a towel fromrnthe bathroom for her, \"Here dry yourself off while I get dressed,\" he whisperedrnto her soothingly, she still didn't make eye contact with him; she just tookrnthe towel off of him and wrapped it around her. Andrew made his way into thernbathroom and put on a white t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants. He quicklyrnreemerged with another towel for her, \"Frankie,\" he tried again to soothe herrnbut again her received the same reaction as before but he didn't stop; herncontinued forward, \" God Frankie, what happened?\" he questioned as he gentlyrntouched her face. With the gentle touch of his hand on her face she broke,rnsobbing uncontrollably, leaning forward into his strong warm embrace. Both ofrnthem sunk to the floor still holding on for dear life, \"It's ok, shh I'm rightrnhere and I'm not going anywhere.\" Just to let everyone know, I am inrncollege now and I'm not sure how often I will be able to write the updates butrnfear not I will update them as much as possible. Please your reviews and mailrnare welcomed and appreciated. Email me at hacktm@muc.edu. Thanks Tiff[Chapter 5] Andrewrnheld Frankie while she sobbed uncontrollably for twenty minutes, he loved thernfeeling of her in his arms again but the reason was not what he had planned. Hernhad hoped she would accept him when he returned with open arms and her lovingrnembrace, not the news of her pending marriage. He just held her, not saying anyrnwords just gently brushing her hair behind her ears trying to calm her down.rnFinally she somewhat composed herself and slightly pulled away, \"Why didn't yourntell me?\" again she repeated her question. Andrewrnrose to hid feet lending a hand to her to help her up, \"I didn't find itrnappropriate at the time,\" he pulled the towel around her shoulders tighter andrnbegan to rub her arms to warm her up. \"But..\"rnFrankie tried to make an argument against him but she was stopped before sherncould start.xa0 Andrew headed towards hisrncloset and grabbed a sweatshirt and a pair of sweatpants. \"Listen,rnhere,\" he handed her the clothing, \"Why don't you go take a shower and relaxrnand warm up, you can put these on. After you're done we will talk aboutrneverything.\" Obviouslyrntoo tired to fight she agreed, \"Alright.\" AsrnFrankie entered the bathroom Andrew got two plates out and set them on therntable next to the balcony doors along with the pizza, he returned and retrievedrntwo beers out of the fridge and set them on the counter. This is gonna bernone long night, was all that was going through his mind. He grabbed one ofrnthe beers, opened it, and headed over to the balcony doors staring out at thernrain slowly coming to a halt. Why did it always rain in this damn city! SlowlyrnFrankie emerged from the bathroom dressed in the oversized sweat outfit withrnher hair wrapped in a towel, all of the make-up she once had on was completelyrnwashed off.xa0 She was so beautiful; yesrntrue, she was in the plainest form he'd only seen when she was recovering, butrnthat was when she was most beautiful. \"Want something to drink?\" he questionedrnmotioning towards the beer on the counter. \"Yeah,rnthanks,\" she accepted the beer he handed her then walked away from him tryingrnto keep her distance. She began surveying the room, taking in her surroundings,rnthat's when Andrew noticed the discoloration on her face. Quicklyrnhe moved towards her placing his hand on her face, \"What the hell happened tornyou? Did he do this to you?\" Shruggingrnhim off and turning her cheek she sulked away from him, \"I thought I was askingrnthe questions here.xa0 Why didn't you tellrnme, why didn't you tell me you weren't a priest anymore. Why did you decide tornkeep it a secret from me.\" She again turned towards him to see the look on hisrnface for his answer. Andrewrnwas getting angry now, do I really have to explain to her why I didn't tellrnher, \"I didn't find it an appropriate time.\" \"Whyrnwasn't it an appropriate time, how hard would it have been to say 'Hey by thernway I'm not a priest anymore?\" she was mocking him now and it really irritatedrnhim. It'srnnot that simple, \" It's not that simple,\" he took a drink and headed towardsrnthe balcony rail since the rain had finally subsided, \"you don't understand.\" \"Whatrnis there to understand, you came back for a visit decided to visit me let mernknow about the 'no priest' thing and leave? That's all you came for right?\" Shernwent towards him but he didn't acknowledge her assumption, figuring herrnprevious statement to be wrong, \"If that's not why you came back, then why?\"rnshe pleaded with him. Now she was curious, there was something he wasn'trntelling her, \"Why did you come back?\" Herncouldn't resist her anymore; he wanted her to know he truth. Very quietly hernwhispered while looking off in the distance, \"I came back for you.\" He tookrnanother drink of his beer then put his head down knowing that she hadn't heardrnhim, hoping she'd let it go. Shernhad barely heard him but knew he had answered her, \"What did you say,\" sherngently placed her hand on his shoulder trying to coax him into repeating hisrnstatement but louder this time. Andrew'srnemotions were getting the best of him and he had no control over himself, usingrna voice that was just below a shout he told her his reasoning again, \"I camernback for you.\" After the recognition of the statement he had just made hernpushed past her and headed back into the room, hoping that this awkwardnessrnwould subside.xa0 Yet, she wasn't about tornlet him off that easy, she followed after him and grabbed him by the armrnspinning him around to face her. \"Whatrndo you mean came, 'back for me',\" she was still a bit lost but was relentlessrnin her advances. \"GodrnFrankie, do I have to spell it out for you,\" he knew there was no turning backrnnow everything was coming out in the open and he couldn't stop it.xa0 \"I love you, Frankie, I've loved you sincernthe moment I met you, and with every letter I fell even more in love with you.\"rnHe turned away from her afraid of her reaction to his confession. Frankierndidn't know what to say, she had always dreamed of this for the past five yearsrnshe wanted to be with him but now for some reason she was confused andrnscared.xa0 All of a sudden without a wordrnshe started to back up towards the door. \"Frankie,\" Oh God, I've scared her away, \"Frankie, what are you doing?\" Frankie turned and bolted forrnthe door, she didn't know where she was gonna go or what she was gonna do. Shernhad to get out of there, it was too much for her, and she sprinted down thernhallway and out the door. \"Frankie,rnwait come back,\" Andrew yelled as he raced towards the door, but all that wasrnleft in the hallway was the echo of the slamming door.[Chapter 6] (\"The Tin Man\" by Kenny Chesney) He just stoodrnthere in the hallway motionless, his body and mind were now completely numb; itrntook all the strength he had not to just collapse where he stood.xa0 Somehow, unknown to him, he managed to makernhis way back into his apartment; he just stood there and began to let hisrnemotions rush over him, his every function was shutting down as his heartrnbroke. He suddenly felt very sick, emotionally as well as physically, hernquickly realized where he was; he inadvertently made his was out onto thernbalcony and was clutching at the rail for dear life.xa0 It was still raining but it was just a slight drizzle, he stoodrnthere grasping tightly to the rail, Frankie's rejection had shaken him to therncore at first he was feeling confident that his feelings would be reciprocatedrnas he held her while she cried.xa0 That'srnwhat made him confess to her everything he felt, he was sure of her feelings ' Hellrnshe even told me she loved me, I don't understand why she ran' he thoughtrnnothing of finally releasing what he'd held inside for so long.xa0 He could never act on his feeling beforernbecause of his duty to the church, he was forced to love her from afar and nowrnin his moment of clarity and honesty he had his heart torn from him. Herncouldn't contain himself anymore he let out a gut wrenching bellow, and beganrnto sob uncontrollably; he sank to his knees and let his heart just relievernitself, as the rain slowly bounced off his already soaked brow.xa0 After he was able to somewhat composernhimself he half-heartedly lifted himself up and went inside, slowly he pickedrnup the towel he had used to dry her off and held it to his face inhaling herrnsweet smell, he sulked to his bed and sat down then slowly let himself fallrnbackwards as to lay on the bed, ' God I miss her, just when I had her closernenough she's ripped from my grasp.' Suddenly he was startled by a knocking on his door,rnhis moves were a quick and sleek, graceful motion, he was at the door andrnbeginning to open it before the person had a chance to finish its secondrnknock.xa0 The sight before him was that ofrnan angel, \"Frankie?\" \"I love you,\" shernsaid as she threw herself into his open and welcoming arms, \"I love you, I lovernyou so much, I'm sorry I ran I was just so scared,\" she was crying and shakingrnterribly.xa0 \"Everything you said was whatrnI've been waiting to hear for five long years… and yet when you said them I…rnwas confused and scared. I can't explain why but it was all too sudden and…\" She hadn't beenrnable to finish her sentence before he gently placed his lips on hers, ' God,rnthis feels so good,' was all the thoughts he was able to process. Afterrnwhat felt like an eternity they pulled apart coming up for air, passionatelyrnthey stared into each others eyes, \"I love you Frankie, I need you…xa0 you complete me;\" he slowly took a breath,rn\"you fill the emptiness inside- something I thought could never be filled tillrnI met you.xa0 Then I saw what it was thatrnI needed, you are my everything Frankie, I… Love You.\" Tears began tornswell in her eyes as she pulled him into another sensual kiss, \"I love yourntoo,\" she whispered. EffortlesslyrnAndrew bent and swept Frankie into his arms and carried her towards his bed,rncarefully setting her down and laying his body next to hers.xa0 Slowly they began to undress each other, eachrnfighting back the need to completely ravage the other, so much time had beenrnwasted that it made them hurry to make sure of their love before somethingrnpulled them apart again. All of a sudden arnbright light pieced through the darkness of the room startling Andrew, hernquickly sat up and began to take in his surroundings; he was laying sprawledrnout across his bed with his damp clothing sticking to his body and clenchedrntightly in his hand was the towel of Frankie's.xa0 The light he had seen was the immense amount of sun coming inrnthrough the balcony window, he looked around there was no clothing thrownrnacross the floor and worst of all there was no Frankie.xa0 His heart sank lower than he had everrnimagined, ' A dream, it was all a damn dream,' was the only thought thatrncrossed his mind a he slipped back into his unconscious state, hoping to escapernthe pain if only for a few hours. Ok I know \"Hey that sucks\" but Irnneeded something to make the story interesting. Again like I said before, withrnthe college thing I don't get to update as much as I would like to but I do myrnbest. Just please be patient and R & R, your feedback is always greatlyrnappreciated.[Chapter 7] It had been 3 long, horribly, lonelyndays since Frankie had rushed out of his apartment and he hadn'tnheard even a word from her in those days since. He stayed hidden awaynin his apartment the whole time, usually sleeping or drinking himselfnto oblivion. He knew that this was no good and that there was nonreason for him to be in the dreadful city any longer, Rome may benmissing the love of his life but at least when he was there hisnemotions weren't put through a terrible roller coaster; when he wasnthere he knew where he stood and that was somewhat comforting. Hendecided to call and make reservations for a flight back to Romenleaving that night, it was a more expensive but he would be away fromnthis whole damaging situation. He decided thatnit would be a good idea to pack first then set out to say goodbye tonFrankie, he wasn't going to tell her he was leaving he would justnmake his peace and then leave without any disturbances. He justnwasn't very sure as to how he would make it through the day withoutnbreaking down again. Frankie had beennrushing around for the past couple days, first she officially brokenoff her relationship with Keech: even though after he hit her it wasnquite clear that it was over then. Unfortunately Donna's mother hadnbecome very sick, needing medical attention, so that's wherenFrankie had been the past two days and would more than likely be forna little while longer. Donna needed her as much as Donna's mothernneeded her but first Frankie needed to make a stop at home to pick upnmore clothes for her stay at the hospital. Hopefully while she was atnhome she could call Andrew, she needed to talk to him; she needed tonexplain her actions the other day but every time she attempted toncontact him something came up. But now she was heading home andnnothing would stop her from calling him, he deserved to know whatnhappened and how she felt. Andrew had beennpaging her place for the past ten minutes and still no answer, henknew that she wasn't home but he was hoping she was maybe asleepnand hadn't heard the buzzer. Finally he gave up and retrieved thenletter out of his coat pocket and placed it in her mailbox, he hadnplanned on her not being there and wrote her a letter telling her hownhe felt and that he was leaving and what time and where he was. Itnwas his last hope that maybe she would read this and come after him,nbut he knew that it would never happen. At the end of his letter hentold her he loved her and that he always would, then he left hisnphone number and address so she could reach him whenever she needednto. He buzzed her place one last time the retreated back to hisnapartment where he would spend the rest on the day till the cab camento pick him up at 5:00pm; he wanted to be at the airport early hopingnit would cause the time to move more quickly and he could leave atn8:00pm. Again Frankienhad gotten tied up talking to the doctor about Donna's mother'sncondition, thankfully it was not serious and after a few more days ofnrecuperation she would be well on her way to a perfect recovery. Shenlooked at her watch and saw that it was about half till five and shenwanted to hurry hopefully she could catch Andrew in time to take himnto dinner and then begin her explaining and then her seriousngroveling. She approached her apartment and noticed the mail that hadnpiled up in her box and it made her chuckle; she grabbed all the mailnand then ascended the stairs to her apartment. Once she had got thendoor to her apartment open, she kicked off her shoes and begannsifting through the junk mail, stopping abruptly at the sight of ansmall envelope with her name neatly inscribed in perfect calligraphy.nHer fingers couldn't open the envelope fast enough, and quickly shenread over the letter in her hands while tears began to fill her eyes.nHer eyes shot to the clock on the wall, it was five till five, shendidn't have much time, thankfully he had got a hotel close to wherenshe lived she could be there in no time. She sprinted out the doornand down the stairs, the only thought her mind could process was thatnshe couldn't lose him, she wouldn't lose him. He took one lastnlook at his place, remember vividly the brief encounter he had withnher then his dream, it was too much he had to go. He sulked down thensteps then handed his key to the registrar and headed towards thendoor. Frankiencouldn't think about anything but getting to Andrew, if he left hernagain she didn't know what she would do.nShe practically sprinted down her stairs, if she could reach him shenjust knew she could make him understand with that final thought shenmade her way down to the street and out the door. Andrewnpushed away from the desk and picked up his luggage. His cab wasnpulling up and his movements seemed to hesitate, he knew it would benbest to get out of this town but his heart was saying a veryndifferent story. Hanging his head he made his way out the door to thenwaiting cab, \"Pittsburgh airport please.\" Andrew closed thendoor to his cab, 'why did this seem so hard.' He looked up quicklynand out the window, it was time to put the pain behind him. Frankienwas turning the corner on her travel to Andrew's hotel and saw himnclimbing into the cab. \"Andrew!\" She called out chasingnafter him; it was too late though the cab started to pull away.n\"Andrew... Wait!\" Thencab driver turned a bit as he pulled away, \"So business trip?nYou don't look too happy.\" \"No,nI'm heading home the only thing I came here for ended up not needingnme.\" He responded somberly. Thendriver just shook his head, \"A woman huh? That's how it alwaysnis.\" Andrewnchuckled a bit, \"It's funny, my mind is playing tricks on me. Inwanted her to be here so badly to stop me from leaving I swear Incould hear her voice.\" Frankienhad chased after him calling his name but the cab never even slowed,n\"Andrew...\" She called one last time as she stopped to catchnher breath.[Chapter 8] Shencalled one last time as she stopped to catch her breath. She reachednin her pocket to pull out his note she scanned it quickly he had toldnher when and where he was leaving, \"Thank you Andrew.\" Hernhand went right up in the air, \"Taxi!\" Andrew'sntaxi had dropped him off outside of departing drop off; he paid hisnfare and made his way inside. \"Good evening,\" he greetednthe young woman at the ticket counter. \"Goodnevening sir, how may I help you?\" the young woman smiled andnbegan processing Andrew's information. \"Justnwant to go home,\" he responded somberly. Shengave him a bright smile, \"Well I've got some good news for younthen, your flight has been rescheduled and you have a choice. Onenleaves at 6:30 now do to some weather problems outside of Rome andnone leaves tomorrow morning.\" Asnmuch as Andrew wanted to wait at the thought of Frankie coming tonstop him, telling him she loved him and not to leave. \"I'll takenthe early flight thank you.\" Thenattendant printed out his ticket and handed it to him. \"Have annice trip and thank you for flying with us.\" Frankiencursed the entire way to the airport; there had been a large accidentnon the exit. It was pushing quarter after 6 when the taxi finallynmade it to the airport. Shenrushed inside and looked up at the departue board, the only Romenflight was already boarding and departing in fifteen minutes. Shenmoved to the ticket desk, \"I'm sorry what happened to the 8pmnflight to Rome.\" Thenwoman smiled, \"That flight was adjusted, now we are offeringneither a 6:30 flight or there is also one tomorrow morning.\" \"Cannyou do me a favor?\" She asked nicely wondering if she could findnout when Andrew was leaving. \"I am supposed to be traveling withna friend; we were supposed to leave on the 8pm flight. AndrewnKiernan?\" Thenlady typed in some information and shook her head, \"I'm sorrynma'am but he's scheduled on the flight at 6:30.\" Thencolor drained from her face, \"What gate?\" \"GatenE, but it's at the other end of the terminal you won't mak...\"nBefore she could finish her sentence Frankie had taken off running.nThe plane was already loading and he was probably already on it butnshe would do everything possible to get to him if she had to fly tonRome the next morning. Andrew'snmovements were slow and hesitant, fumbling his ticket in his hand asnhe stood in the boarding line. He kept looking back over his shouldernwondering if she had even received his note, a sad look shown in hisneyes as a voice caught his attention. \"Excusenme, sir? This is last call…will you be boarding?\" The gentlemanntaking the tickets asked Andrew since was the last one in thenboarding line. \"Sir?\" Andrewnnodded his head and made his way towards the entrance. Frankienhad sprinted the entire way across the terminal but she feared shenwas too late. Not only did she have to fight the entire way throughnthe crowd but once she arrived at Gate E it was practically empty.nOut of breathe and upset she approached one the female attendants,n\"Rome…6:30pm fli…flight?\" Thenfemale attendant shook her head, \"I'm sorry ma'am..\" shenturned around and pointed out the window at a plane just taking off.n\"You've missed it by just a few minutes, can I help you withnanything.\" Tearsnstarted to run fresh down cheeks as she watched Andrew fly out of hernlife again; she turned back to the attendant. \"No, I just…Indidn't get to say good-bye.\"[Chapter 9] Frankie stepped closer to the large viewing window and watched Andrew's plane ascending into the air, the one thing she needed most in the world was flying away into the setting sun and out of her life. She'd been so stupid her entire life, it seemed she could never do anything right. Andrew had always been the forbidden fruit in her life; she had dreamed so often of him and being close to him that it hurt her heart to know that he was the one thing in her life she needed and could never fully have. It all seemed to be too much for her, her emotions overwhelmed her and her heart broke as the tears started to flow freely. Her legs seemed to become weak and unable to sustain her weight as she sank into the chair next to her, she put her head into her hands and started to cry freely attempting to release the pain constricting around her heart. Andrew just sat there dumbfounded his heart ached and yearned for Frankie but he just couldn't make it understand what was occurring. He gently rubbed his temples as he sat back in his chair hoping to ease the throbbing sound in his head. It was something he was just going to have to accept, Frankie was the love he would have to keep only in his heart and love from afar. It was a dramatic irony for him, he'd helped save her life and in return she had saved him teaching him to love again but in the same instance that he held her he lost her. In his heart he knew he could have been the man she deserved, the man that would love her until his last breath and even after he'd left this earth he'd wait for her at the gates of Heaven because he couldn't bear to be without her. But he would pick up the pieces of his broken heart and return home; he'd never stop loving her through she was like air or water he needed her to survive. The soft sound of a woman crying brought him out of his thoughts; he sat up in his seat to attempt to locate the cause of the sound. Frankie could barely control herself; it hurt too much to stop crying and the thought of returning to her apartment without Andrew to the empty lonely apartment made her cry harder. A soft hand touched her shoulder and she looked up. \"Ma'am are you alright?\" A female attendant asked softly handing Frankie a tissue. Frankie smiled at the gesture and took the tissue, nodding sadly, \"I'll be fine, I just need to go home.\" With that said Frankie stood from the chair on unsure legs and gave a squeeze to the ladies arm along with a sad smile. Taking a few deep breathes she made slow steps away from the chair and took her first steps towards picking up the broken pieces of her heart. Andrew had taken a few glances around at his surroundings but wasn't able to locate the source of the crying. He closed his eyes again letting all the memories he had of Frankie rush back to him, it was all he'd have and he cursed his tortured mind for the horrible dream he'd had only a few nights before that made his heart and body yearn for her more. The feeling of someone bumping his arm brought him out of his trance once more; he opened his eyes, \"Oh I do apologize.\" Frankie hadn't been as composed as she thought was stumbling a bit in her steps and accidentally bumped into a gentleman's armrest, \"No it's my…\" but the rest of the words would not come. Andrew mustered up a polite smile and looked up at the person who had bumped into his arm and his heart stopped, there before him was his angel. \"Frankie?\" Was the only sound he could muster it sounded more like a sweet prayer to his ears. In the same instance he was out of his chair and clutching her as they both sank to the floor on their knees holding tightly to one another. Through the renewed tears she choked out, \"I …I thought you left..left me again.\" She wrapped her arms around him and sobbed into his shirt. It all seemed so surreal to her and she could barely believe what was happening. Andrew just held her tightly, he hadn't found words yet and it was better to just hold her in his arms just so he knew she was real and this wasn't another trick his mind was playing on him to torture his soul just a little more. Frankie pulled back a bit and looked up at him, \"But your plane…\" she sniffled a bit, \"I just watched it fly off.\" Andrew didn't wait one more second he leaned in and kissed her strong and passionately; it was something he'd needed to do for a long time. After what seemed like an eternity the two pull back breathless, gently he brushed away the stray hairs from her face. \"I couldn't get on the plane…I would rather be here and miserable but close to you than to be miserable and half way across the globe.\" He just continued to hold her and smiled; he placed a gentle finger under her chin and lifted her face to look into his eyes. Frankie smiled at him, and didn't waste anymore time. She'd learned the hard way, what waiting to tell someone how you feel can do, \"I love you Andrew…I've loved you for so long. I would have followed you around the world to be with you, because that's what people do when they found the one they can't live without. They leap, and hope to God they can fly, because otherwise you just drop like a rock, wondering the whole way down, why in the hell did I jump? But here I am, Andrew, falling, and the only one that makes me feel like I can fly... is you.\" Andrew felt tears stinging his eyes; he smiled at her and tightened his embrace on her. \"I love you too Frankie. Ho occhi solo per te, mio angelo... sei bellissima .. Vorrei trascorrere tutta la mia vita con te.\" He kissed her sweetly and chuckled at her look, \"Translation… I only have eyes for you, my angel...you are so beautiful. I want to spend all my life with you.\" Fin Finally completed leave love or hate.

I got up early that morning cause I was going to go to school (yet I hated it so much)the sun was already up, I dressed up as quickly as possible and went out from my dark room.. I wasn't the normal teenager, I was all different from my friends, my room was dark with plenty of pictures of the bands, I liked many bands and loves listening to metal. My favourite bands were Motionless In White and Black Veil Brides, my \"friends\" usually thought I was Satanist but they all were assholes, they liked creepy music. I didn't even like going outside , I preferred sitting in my dark room, listening to metal and playing my guitar. Maybe I was different for the pain I usually felt cause my father was dead. He died last year in accident. My mather stayed all alone. She had only me and I was trying to help her. She was very worried about me, worried that I didn't have many friends and I was lonely child. My father tought me not to imitate others and to be myself. He meant everything to me and suddenly he left me as nothing and flew away. Left me all alone with these stupid kids . so I was depressed and so I was very lonely. my friends weren't trying to help me, opposite, they were trying to laugh at me all the time, I was called emo and stupid dorky kid. That's why I hated school so much. My mom was trying tomake me feel good and to make me see I wasn't alone, and I tried to show her that I was okay, though I was lying. I was fucking sixteen years old yet and I couldn't even imagine my life would be so difficult at age of sixteen when I was still child and when I was just starting my life So I was a lonely kid with lots of problems. And I hated school very much because of this. I found my inspiration in bands and in metal music, it was vital for me.I was in a bad mood every morning but that day was different. I went to the kitchen . my mom was already up and she was cooking meal for me. \"oh you woke up honey?\" she asked looking at me.\" Yeah hello mom\" I greeted and kissed her on cheak. \"I've cooked something for you, I hope you'll like it\" \"I love everything that is made by your hands mom\" I said and sat at the table. I wasn't even hungry but I didn't want my mom to be worried about me so I forced myself to eat. \"honey\" she started \"I hope everything will be okay at school today\" she smiled at me \" yea I hope too, but I hate all my classmates\" I said and continued eating.\" Don't say that, they are your friends\" \" no they aren't\" I said, I was going to stop eating and to go as quickly as I could but then I saw my mom's worried face and said\" ok sorry, I'll try\" \"that's good\" she said with smiling and stood up. \" yes and don't forget when you come back home to do a revision cause soon you're gonna have exams and you know , okay? \"yea, okay,I'll do, just I have to go somewhere, my guitar isn't playing as well as it did before and I wanna check it ok?\" \" okay honey.. do whatever you want with your guitar\" she finished and stood up \" now I have to go to work, be careful dear \" she said , kissed me and left. She was working in a magazine as a seller and had to go to shop earlier than me. So when I finished eating I stood up and went to school,yet I didn't want but I had to[Chapter 2] So I went to school, as I went in nobody looked at me, I was happy for it cuz everyday they were looking at me and yelling something rude. I came to my desk in the corner and set down, as I did it someone yelled \"look our dorky emo came\" and everyone laughed, I didn't do anything, just sat there and started repeating my lessons, first lesson we had in math. There was nothing to repeat so I just let my books lay on my desk and listened to my idiot classmates yelling the kid came to me. That was Alicia, she was the one who was kind to me and there were few more people. She sat there next to me and said \" hey Frankie how are you\" I was so pleased and replied \"mmm great and you?\" \"me too\" she said\" have you heard there's a new teacher in maths?\" \"no. is there?\" \"yea I don't know yet who he or she is but let's see.. i'm gonna like anyone more than our last teacher\" \"yea me to, he was such an idiot\" I said and she laughed at it, I think there was nothing to laugh at cause I said it all seriously.. I remember once he forgot something and we all helped him.. after that he said he knew everything, he just wanted to see what we knew.. so yeah.. there was a new teacher and I was so looking forward it. I don't know why but I was wondering so bad who he was. Every teacher was bullying me and I knew this new teacher was going to do it too.. not at once, but when he'd know who I really was I knew, he'd bully me too.\"what are u thinking about\" I heard suddenly and I remembered Alicia sitting next to me.\" Um nothing I just wonder who he is\" \" yeah, everyone wonders Frank, now what about you?\" she asked \" nothing, you?\" \" nothing much\" she smiled\" I hope you aren't listening to these idiots cause that don't worth it\" \" I know and that's what I'm doing\" I smiled at her, she cared of me a lot and but I knew she had a boyfriend, besides I never liked her, I've never liked a girl and I didn't even want. I've never liked a boy too (thanks to god) and I was so disgusted about gays. I hated them. I've never supported gay marriage cause they were disgusting. so finally the ring was bang. Student sat at their desks.\" Ok I'm gonna go\" Alicia said and went. So I was left alone again in my desk.. there were two places in each desk. I was sitting alone. My other friends were sitting in pairs. Alicia was sitting next to her boyfriend, so yeah. Now we all were at our places. There was silence until our teacher didn't come in. We stood up, I was sitting in the last row so I didn't see him at once , all I saw was that he was a boy. When all sat down I saw him and I was amazed. He was so beautiful, I've never seen the man and so beautiful, usually men were handsome but he was just beautiful, he had long black hair hiding his eyes. He wasn't too tall and he wasn't too short too. He had normal height and was very handsome. I looked at my friends, they all were looking at him but I didn't see amazing faces, I noticed that they didn't like him as much as I did. So I just stopped looking at them and looked at our new teacher again. \"so\" he started and he had such a nice voice \"I think you all know that from this day on I'll be your teacher\" we all agreed.\" Okay now, yea, so my name is Gerard Way\" he said, Gerard, first what I thought of was that Gerard wasn't such a good name. I preferred my name, but I hated everything besides this, about my personality.. he finally continued \"I see you don't like me now but soon you'll like me, I promise\" he said and smiled and as he said it everyone yelled that he was better than the last one. \"oh, you aren't even good students, you must love your teacher guys, especially he was teaching you this subject during 4 years. \"\" but he was so stupid and he was hitting us if we didn't know the answer\" my classmate Bill said.\" Don't even try and call a teacher stupid !\" Gerard said. \" Now, let's continue oh\" he uttered and looked at me\" why is that boy sitting there alone?\"and mentioned to me with his finger. Everyone started laughing and said that I was unfriendly.\" That's not the reason\" Gerard said\" do u wanna sit there little boy?\" he asked and I felt something dropped in my stomach. He was talking to me and I don't know why but I couldn't speak \" yea\" was all I said. \"okay\" he said\" now tell me your name guys. I need to know cause now I'm your teacher\" he said and set down at his table... I was the last one. Everyone said their names and stuff about them and now there was my turn. I stood up, \"ummm\" I started. \"yes, I'm listening\" Gerard said and smiled \"my name is Frank\" I said and everyone laughed. \"silence!\" Gerard yelled.\" I didn't think you were such a noisy class\" he said. \" okay. Continue\" \" yeah\" I uttered\" and my lastname is IERO\" I said and looked at class. They weren't smiling. I looked at Gerard, neither was he. \" then\" he said. \" tell me something about yourself\" I started talking but suddenly Bill started \" he is unfriendly, is stupid idiot and dorky kid\" half of the class laughed. \" Gerard stood up \"look at me\" said to Bill. Bill looked at him. Gerard went to him and said with smiling. I thought he was going to laugh too but instead he said\" and why do you think you're not the things you followed?\" Bill stopped laughing. I was amazed. He wasn't a bad teacher I thought . He wasn't as bad as the others, he wasn't at all. \"what?\" Bill asked. \"if you don't shut up, I'll be free to expel you from the school\" Gerard said. Bill's face went red, he was embrassed and I saw hate on his face. I finally started speaking. I said that I loved listening to metal music and that I liked playing guitar. I also told him that I had no father. Gerard was looking at me with poor eyes. When I finished speaking he came near to me and looked at me. I just saw his hazel eyes. How beautiful they were. \"okay Frank yes? Or….\" \"yeah, Frank\" \" okay. Sit down Frank, but do you want to sit there alone?\" he asked, I couldn't speak I just nooded once. \"okay \" was all he said. Then he started speaking about himself and told us that we could ask him some questions. I didn't ask him anything, I wasn't on that mood but from what others asked and he answered, I heard that he was 25 years old. Twenty-fucking-five years old. He was so young, of course for the teacher's profession. My other teachers all were above 30 and he was 25. He was so young, nine years older than me. It was so amazing. And he looked so young too. Well, I wasn't expecting less from him but I would never imagine he was 25 years old. after some minutes the lesson was over. Gerard left our class, I didn't even move, I knew, I dunno why, but I knew from this day on there was going to happen something new in my life, Gerard wasn't like other teachers, he was different, he didn't laugh at me and I was so happy.[Chapter 3] There was a night, I was laying in my bad and thinking, I just stopped playing my fav song of BVB on my guitar. I was just thinking. That day wasn't normal, it was different, something different. Everyday what I got from school was bullying and other shit, my friends calling me \" emo and dorky kid\" but today, today that changed. Gerard defended me, he told Bill that he was all the things he followed, I don't know why, but I felt that my life was going to change. I knew that from today Gerard wasn't going to let my friends talk during the lesson and call me \"dorky\", maybe I was stupid, maybe I thought deeper and there was going to happen nothing, but I knew it, don't know why, but I knew it, he was a different teacher, very different. He didn't let them laugh at me and he, himself didn't laugh at me. Every teacher was laughing at me and were ironic, but not at once, when they got a new I was different, I listened to metal and I was alone and unfriendly they all started to ignore me, it was fact. Sometimes my mother went to them to talk and solve the problem. Then they were respecting me but after some time, they were starting to ignore me again. Now everything was different. Gerard was different. suddenly I heard a knock on the door. It was my mom. She entered\" honey, it's me, aren't you hungry?\" she asked. \" no mom thanks, I'd rather sleep now\" I replied and smiled. \" you look happy today, what happened?\" she asked ,putting her hands on my head and sliding them on my hair. \" nothing special\" I answered \"it's just… nobody bullied me today \"I said and looked up at her in her eyes\" really? It's nice to hear it honey\" she said\"all I want is you, to be happy sweetheart, I hope it gets better\" \"I love you mom\" I said and kissed her. I loved her so much, she was so caring. She was always worried about me and I felt she did loved me back too. She was the best person I've ever seen. I had no father and my mother was trying to do everything for me, to feel safe and great. I loved her, I really loved her so much \" me too honey\" she replied and kissed me on my forehead \"sleep well\" she said and left. I was very tired, all I wanted was sleep. I couldn't think of anything anymore, I just couldn't, I closed my eyes and fell asleep. When I woke up the next day I was alone at home. I got up and went to kitchen. There was a letter on the table. I took it, it was from my mother, she was writing that she had to go to her work early cause there were many buyers. That was okay, there were days when it was happening. Then I looked at the clock and discovered that I got up late, I had only 15 minutes left until school .\"oh, how stupid I am \" I uttered, usually my mother was waking me up early, I really couldn't wake up on time. Today she was gone and I was late. I didn't even brush my hair or eat anything, I just took my bag and ran to school. when I got there I noticed that I wasn't late, I was running and I managed to go to school on time. I was so tired, I had run all the way to school. I put my bag on the ground and rest against the wall. I was breathing hard, when I heard the voice \" hey look at that fag, he is so red, look\" someone said and I knew it was my classmate's James' voice. I didn't answer at all, I just ignored him as my mother told me. \" what ,are u scared?\" he said and I heard everyone laughing behind him. I ignored him again. He stepped forward me, I looked at him \" oh why are u red? U were running? Or your mother punished you for the bad mark and beat you?\" he yelled and looked at others, they were laughing and couldn't breathe from it. I looked up at him, he was way taller than me. I was the smallest in my class, everyone were tall. \" don't ever dare and speak about my mother \" I yelled and stepped forward him. \" oh, you know how to speak?\" he said and looked down at me, I was so upset, I wanted to hit him in his face and beat him, but I knew I couldn't do it, he was stronger than me and taller than me. I knew he was gonna beat me anyway. \"listen carefully\" I started.\" Oh, I'm so scared\" James uttered. \"if you don't want me to hit you, then shut the hell up.\"I screamed. He looked amazed, I didn't know why, but then I got everything \"I didn't even know you knew how to say SHUT THE HELL UP, you mama's boy\" he said with a great irony and put his nose on mine with eyes full of anger. I really was scared cause I knew he was going to hit me if I told him something rude. the bell rang. I thought he was going to go now but instead he stayed there waiting what I was gonna say. I'd rather get a bad mark or do something really bad, than say something bad to him cause he had beaten many children in our school and he was a really good fighter. I didn't know what to do, on other hand I wanted to tell him something, so that he couldn't bully me anymore. \" what are u thinking about?\" he asked me ,scanned his eyes on me and looking at me carefully. \" I just..\" I stopped, I had the venom for him cause he was the one who was bullying me everyday. I wanted to tell him something, I really did but all what I dared was \"you better keep your ass away from me\" and then I thought I was going to die. I didn't know what I was talking, I just wanted to get away from hallway was nearly empty, there were some students looking at James and interesting what was he going to say. First lesson we had in history and our teacher was very severe. If we didn't go to his lesson on time he was going to punish us but James wasn't worried about it. He was looking at me, I thought he was going to beat me. I was really scared, especially when he did something scary. He lifted his hand in the air to hit me, I knew I was going to be beaten by him, when I suddenly heard a familiar voice. \"what's up here?!\" someone shouted .I had my eyes closed, afraid of what James was going to do. James put his hand down and looked back. It was Gerard, standing there and looking at James, I was amazed. This man saved me again. Students were looking at him. \" go to class, \" he shouted \"now!\"everyone moved including James and me but he added \" you're not going anywhere, you two\" and pointed at us.\" You\" he moved to others\" go to lesson now, it began a while ago and tell the teacher about Frank and this boy, I forgot the name\" he said, I was amazed, he hadn't forgotten my name, but maybe it was because I had an easy name to remember. \" tell the teacher\" Gerard continued\" that I have these 2 students, now go\" he finished and looked at us. I thought he was going to punish us because of our behavior, but it wasn't my fault, it was all James' fault, really. But I wasn't going to defend myself. I just stood there. Despite of these all, I was happy, cause our history teacher was gonna punish us anyway and I preferred Gerard to do that cause he wasn't as severe as the other one. \" do you know what you just did here\" he started. Looking at James. \" it's really bad behavior to beat your classmate. \" I didn't beat him\"James said with an anger. \" stop talking when I'm speaking. I came on time. If I didn't come, you would have beaten him. Am I right?\" \" he said something rude\" James said. I was amazed, he was blaming me. I couldn't believe my ears.\" What?\" I uttered. \" okay Frank \" Gerard said \" you didn't say something rude? Then I'll ask Frank what you told him okay? And let's see what he's going to answer.\" I was looking down and was feeling really guilty, though it wasn't my fault. \" next time, you'll do the thing like that, I'm gonna do something really bad to you. You understand?\" \"but..\" James started. \" nothing.\" Gerard said \"I don't mind whose fault was this. You were going to hit him. And I know for sure that this was your fault. You, everyone, are bullying this boy. And it's not correct behavior. You should know that he's the student just like you despite of his taste and difficulties, which he has gone through in his life\" I was just distructed. Of course I told him at the first lesson that I had no father and he remembered it. He was really good man. \" if you understand then, Frank\" he moved forward me \" you can go to class. I'll tell everyone not to bully you at my lesson. Now you can go\" he told me and smiled a little. I was surprised, he had really nice smile. I moved and smiled back. When I was turning aside I heard Gerard's voice\" you James, are going to punish for your bad behavior. To bully someone just because his personality is a big sin. Now come with me\" it was just incredible. He defended me, but it was nothing of course. He was a teacher and he had to defend me. It was his responsibility. But why weren't others doing the same. That's why I knew he was different and he was going to talk to all my classmates not to bully me. It was just unbelievable. i couldn't believe this. everyone were looking at me the whole lesson. They weren't laughing at me, sometimes they were whispering something to each other while looking at me but it really didn't matter, I ignored them all. The most important thing for me at that moment was Gerard and the fact that he defended me. James was looking at me with venom and with eyes full of anger but i was ignoring them too.I was thinking about that moment all day. And I was happy. Finally they were going to respect me and not to bully me because Gerard was really important teacher at school and each student had to listen to him. It was incredible. That guy defended me, I couldn't wait until my mom would hear these all. She'd be very happy. I was deeply in my thoughts when someone shouted at me \" Frank, u here?!\" I just realized I was at the lesson. it was the last lesson that day and maybe i was tired. my teacher was shouting at me. \"umm.. yeah, what?\" I uttered, I was really confused. I looked around . Everyone were staring at me. \" what do you want?\" I asked. \" hey, take care of your words, you're talking to the teacher!\" my teacher said. What did I say? Oh, why were everyone so rude to me? \" now, I forgot the marks of your control writing, it's somewhere in teachers' room and you're gonna bring it here okay?\" she said. So.. when my teachers had forgotten the marks, they were always telling me to bring them back and it was so annoying. I stood up slowly \" it would be better if you hurry up\" \"okay, okay\" I replied\" but tell me where can I find it\" \" I told you it's in our room. I don't know where, maybe on the table, \"\" okay\" I said and left the classroom. Why me, why did I have to do everything, weren't others in class.? So I went to the room and knocked twice. \" come in \" someone responded. It was Gerard's voice. I went in, nobody was there but Gerard. He was standing there, looking at some sheets of paper. \" may I come in?\" I asked. \" oh, yeah of course Frank, what's up?\" he asked without looking at me. \" oh, I.., my teacher of literature sent me to bring her the marks of our control writing, she said it was here, somewhere.\" \" oh, really?\" Gerard put down the sheets and looked at me now\" okay, you can sit here, until I can find them. \" okay\" I said but I didn't dare anything, I was just standing there, he looked at me \" Frank, sit down\". \" umm.. okay \" I told him and sat down on the nearest chair. \" teacher Gerard \" I started, I wanted to ask him something, I just couldn't dare it. \" yeah Frank \" he said,searching our marks on shelves \" may I ask you something?\" I asked thinking he'd say-no, \" feel free to ask me questions Frank\" Gerard said. \" okay, I was wondering, umm, I was.. \" I couldn't bring myself to ask it. \" Frank, ask me, come on\" he looked at me for a while. \" okay \" I said \" are you really.. mm.. I mean, are you really..25 years old?\" I finally did it. I thought now Gerard was going to look at me with anger but instead he looked at me and said \" yeah Frank, what , do I look older?\" \" oh, no, you don't, I was expecting you were young but I'd never imagine you were 25\" I said\" yeah, maybe, cause your teachers all are more than 28 or 30, I know, I'm young but I know enough to be a teacher\" he smiled \" oh, I know, you are a great teacher\" I said and looked down \" oh, how do you know? I was only twice in your class\" Gerard asked, he was right, he was only twice in our class, but I wasn't talking about math, I was talking about him, himself. He was so kind. \" oh, I mean, teach, I mean that, you're very kind\" I said \" really? Do you think I am kind?\" \" yeah, you defended me, nobody's done it before. You know, even teachers were bullying me and you are the only one who helped me\" I said and looked up at him. He was really young and really beautiful, his hazel eyes..oh, what I was thinking about, he was a teacher but I couldn't look in his eyes , they were so beautiful. He looked at me and sat on the chair right in front of me so that we were looking at each-other in eyes equally. \" if so, then I'm here to defend you\" he said \" bullying is a great sin Frank. You can't bully someone just because of his taste or as I said just because he's gone through hard times. I remember you telling me you have no father\" he finished, I could feel him breathing hard. I heard it and I felt it. And suddenly I was nervous. \"yes, I have no father, he died a while ago in a car accident and it's the reason of why I am depressed right now with all the others, including bullying\" \"exactly, that's why I'm going to continue defending you, you need help now. I've never met a guy like you before. Different and depressed and you know what? I prefer you're kinda guys, than mean ones, who bully everyone just because they are taller and stronger\" he said, we were looking in each-other's eyes again. His hazel eyes, his breathing, I could feel everything. He had so beautiful face, he was beautiful. The different and the greatest teacher I've ever had. And he was sitting in front of me. Very close, looking in my eyes carefully. I was nervous, I didn't know what was up. I was just nervous. My hands started to go wet, my face too. I could feel how my face was covering with sweat. I needed to stop it. I really needed. Cause I really got nervous. he was sitting so close, we nearly touched our noses.\" \"I\", I uttered \"uh, er… I need to go, my teacher's waiting for me \" I said and stood up and suddenly I felt facilitation. It was easier to be farther from him cause I lost control when I was that close, as I was seconds ago. \" okay\" Gerard said \" I found them, here you go \" he finished and gave me the marks. \" I think this is what you were looking for, if not, you can come again and I'll research \" he smiled. I thought I melted with his smile. I would rather go to hell than come here again. I needed to be far away from him for a while. I didn't know what was up with me. I really didn't know. It was something different. I was feeling something about my teacher but it was love as I felt with others. He was my teacher and I loved him. There was nothing different. I loved all my teachers. That was all. But why did I get nervous when I was near him, close to him? \" okay\" I said and got away from that place as fast as I could[Chapter 4] It was Thursday. I was lying on my bed when I heard someone shouting form downstairs. \" Frankie, get up, honey, it's time to go to school\". Oh it was my mom. I had to wake up. I didn't want to do that. I wanted to continue sleeping cause I went to bed late last night,. NO. I went on time, I just couldn't sleep. I was thinking the whole night. Thinking of everything, of my life, of Gerard. Thinking of what happened yesterday. But then I got everything. He was just a teacher and he was doing what he was supposed to do. It was his responsibility to defend children. And I got nervous cause he was a new teacher and I hadn't spent too much time with him. That's why I wasn't nervous when I was with other teachers, they were my old ones. Gerard was new, also I was a shy person. That was all. Gerard was just a new teacher. I woke up, dressed up, brushed my teeth and went downstairs. My mom was in the kitchen. \" come on, dear, eat something. You must be hungry now\" \" I'm not, mom, I don't want anything, I just.. have to go to school\" I said and took my bag but my mom stopped me\" what? When did you start going to school so early?\" I looked at clock. It was 30 minutes left before school. \"I.. er.. well. I didn't know that I had left so many time until school\" I muttered and put my bag down. I wanted to go to school. Usually I didn't go to school so early and also didn't wanted to ,but I had started it nowadays. \"you didn't know?\" my mom started \"is there something happening at school Frank? You look happy.\" \"there's nothing new mom, well , there is, but. In one word. Children stopped bullying me for that new teacher, Gerard\" I said. \"really?\" mom asked \"that's cool. He's a good teacher, isn't he?\" \"yeah, he defended me twice\" I said. \" mom I have to give my friend a book he gave me yesterday and so I have to go now. I'm sorry\" I uttered and stood up. \"okay Frank. Do what you want, just be careful, now go\" she smiled and kisses me on my forehead. \" okay, see ya\" I said and left my house. I wasn't thinking about anything, I tried at least. Everything was like I thought. Gerard was just new, that was all. When I came to class, nobody looked at me. I just heard several whispers like \"look at that emo, he came to school\" nothing else. I was so grateful of Gerard. It was his desert. As I sat at my desk, the bell rang. I was excited, first lesson we had in maths. Everyone went to their desks. Gerard entered. He was wearing black shirt and jeans as always. His black hair, they were so long that they disturbed Gerard with seeing things. And he had to replace them from his eyes very often. He came in and greeted. We did the same. I was sitting at my old desk again, in the last row, in the corner. I laid on my desk, I didn't want Gerard to see me, but I knew he was going to see me anyway cause it was a lesson and suddenly I remembered what Gerard had told me yesterday. He was going to talk to everyone about me. Holy fuck ! this was the only thing now that I wanted to happen at least. I was excited of it yesterday but now I was nervous. My heart started beating faster. I was afraid of what was going to happen next. Gerard looked at us and asked who was absent today. When my classmate was done, Gerard looked at us again and asked \" you forgot frank, isn't he at school today?\" I was laying on my desk. But it was in the last row so he didn't recognize me. I got up quickly. It hit me when I heard him saying my name. \"I'm here, teach,\" I uttered. \" oh, well, \" he said\" okay, I didn't notice you, you were laying but it's lesson Frank, and you have to get up\" he finished and went to the blackboard. \"now, what was our lesson today?\" he asked looking at my classmate. Fuck. I wanted to lay down. I really didn't want to be at that lesson and I was happy that Gerard forgot something he promised me the day before. Somehow I was happy of it but my happiness seemed to be short cause then I suddenly heard his voice \"but,\" he uttered \"we have something to talk about before it.\" He looked me and I guessed what he was going to do. \"before the lesson I want to talk to you about Frank. For now I know only Frank who you are bullying. Just tell me if there is anyone else and I'm gonna defend him too\" he said. Everyone sighed.\"bullying is a sin\" he started. \"do you know what are you doing now with that boy?\" he asked \" you're destructing his life. I know many children who commited suicide because of bullying. Do you want your friend to do the same?\" he asked and looked at all of my classmates. I was really surprised. I had never thought about suicide before cause of my mother. She had no husband. That was enough for her. If she hadn't had a son, she would really be depressed and lonely and I didn't want it for her cause I loved her more than anyone on the Earth planet. \"he is depressed\" Gerard continued \" he needs your help now. He has no father. He has gone through the hardest of times in his life. You'll never know what it means unless you're not going to go through it yourselves.\" He was right. He was really right and suddenly I started liking this conversation. He was all right. Some sighed on a very loud voice. \"why are you sighing? I am saying truth to you and you have to listen. From this day on, you're not allowed to bully children at school and especially your classmate. I hope there are not others like Frank. Yeah? If there are, please tell me. And this conversation isn't just about Frank, it about others too who are bullied by you.\" Everyone were quiet, listening to Gerard. I looked up at him. During this I was looking somewhere down. I looked at him. He was looking at me, he smiled a little. I don't know exactly if it was smile or not but it seemed more like it. \"if you understand, then we can go on the lesson \" he said and set at his table. I really wasn't on that mood I wanted just to lay down cause everyone were looking at me. They were surprised cause Gerard was the only teacher to speak about this, the one and only, the first and the last. I knew it. He really was the best teacher, THE BEST. That day was fucking awesome. i just became a little tired because after school the books were brought in our school and we had to take them into our library. it wasn't that hard to do.. i just did everything slowly because i wanted to watch Gerard, the more i watched him, the prettier he seemed in my eyes, he was unbelievebly beautiful. whenever i looked at his hazel eyes i thought i was going to do. But.. wait.. why was i talking like this about him? huh? that was a bit funny. he was a teacher, a male teacher. but i think it just was that he was beautiful.. what happened then? everyone's said of someone that he's beautiful. yeah, i was a boy too but he was beautiful, you can't hide what's real, he just was. could i change anything? he helped us lift the books in library. oh.. he got sweaty when we finished everything, i don't know why but i got excited, i guessed that same thing was going to happen to me, or he was going to see how carefully i was looking at him. i prefered going home.[Chapter 5] as days passed, my life became better and better. well.. not as better as i wanted my life to be. when i was a little boy.. i mean 8-9 years old, when my father was still alive, i wanted to be teenager who partied all day, kissed girls, had sex with all of them and go home very, very late. that's a little funny because the situation i was in now was that i was a boy who never went outside, didn't love patrying, loved sleeping, metal and playing guitar. same right? omg.. i think that's funny. i changed a lot, my father's death changed me a lot. Gerard was trying to do everything to me. i didn't know why, really, he was way too interested in me, he always defended me when someone tried to bully me. i remember once he punished my friends for bullying me and the punishment was that he didn't let them go to the gym, they had an olimpic games in football and Gerard left them at school and made them tidy up whole lavatory. that was so funny. Nearly nobody was daring too bully me especially from that day on because they were so afraid of Gerard. Gerard was probably one of the most important teachers in our school. he defended me so many times.. did so many things to me and i wanted to tell him something, or do something to make him see how grateful i was for him for doing these things for me. He was trying to make me feel free at the lesson and tell my opinion.. others didn't let me do it before Gerard, though i knew all the answers of the questions (let's call that time\"before Gerard\" because after Gerard the new era of my life began, Gerard changed my life a lot, so let's call the time when Gerard wasn't here \"until gerard\") yeah. so. Gerard let me say what i was thinking.. i was right at times and not right at others but that was okay because what i was doing was cool and i had all \"A\"es in y works. i wanted to teach harder. mom was so happy because of it. To tell you that i wasn't depressed anymore would be the biggest lie probably, so.. i was.. but not as much as i was \"before Gerard\" Gerard made me see tha im not alone, sometimes i thought that he was like me, depressed and etc. blah, but that was false of course because he wasn't.. he was just adorable. fantastic teacher. how many times i tried to thank him but he denied and told me that he wasn't doing it for me to thank him all the time.. he just thought that i was the best student in school and made these, everything, to me, because i was so fantastic kid and wanted to see me happy. i knew, i wasn't fantastic, he couldn't tell me i wasn't fantastic and i was ugly right? it'd be very bad of him. So.. once when someone tried to blame everything he's done on me (he stole something from school) Gerard saw that it was him, and not me and defended me. i couldn't thank him because he had to go... I really had to do this, to thank him.. i was really looking forward another day to do this. when our maths lesson was over children went outside. Gerard was sitting at his table again and wasn't going anywhere. He was just looking at his hand. He had something on it. I just couldn't notice it cause of my position. I wasn't going anywhere. I was grateful for Gerard, very grateful. Now everyone were outside and I wanted to thank him. I stood up and went through him. I still couldn't bring myself to it. When I was near him, he noticed that I was going to him and hided something with his cloth on his hand. I was confused, but when I went to him to say something, the bell rang. \" Frank, you don't need to thank me\" he just said with the face expression that was telling that he didn't want to talk about it at the moment. I went to my desk. I became a little angry. Was I annoying? He didn't listen to me. His face was so hurtful. Maybe something hurt? In his hand which he hid when I went to him? He wasn't even good at the lesson. He was always happy and always funny when we had a lesson but now? It was different. He didn't even shout when he heard someone talking. So bill dared a lot. He was speaking the whole lesson. Usually he loved imitating emos. It was hurting a little cause they were calling me emo. And he started again, he just hadn't dared to do something like that on Gerard's lesson. But now that there was something up with Gerard, he started. \" look, I love emos and I am emo\" Gerard didn't say anything, I don't know he if he heard it or not, but he just didn't say anything. \" I love cutting myself\" Bill continued \" I love, how is it called? –self-harm\" he uttered. I rolled my eyes. There was nothing funny in self-harm., though I had never self-harmed. Bill took a red pencil and started making red lines on his wrists. \"look\" he was shouting. \" look, oh my god\" he cried\" I self-harmed. I'm an emo, oh my god, it hurts, haha\" he finished and laughed and suddenly Gerard stood up and went to Bill. Bill threw away the pencil and looked at Gerard. Gerard went to him. I thought he dared a lot and Gerard was going to shout at him but instead he stood quiet next to Bill . it seemed that he was thinking about something. Then he looked down at him and lifted the sleeves of his shirt. Holy shit. It was unbelievable. He had big scars on his wrists. I was fucking destroyed and couldn't believe my eyes. He had scars of cutting. HE SELF-HARRMED. These last words hit me like a gun. Oh, he had so many scars, hell of a lot. Bill was shocked, he opened his mouth in horror. So did others. It was just incredible. The man who saved me, the man who defended me, the man who made my classmates not to bully me, was self-harming. Maybe it's one of many reasons of why he defended me. He had big scars, very big. It wasn't new. He had no any blood, they seemed to be very old but he had them. He had self-harmed. Maybe not now, but he was doing it formerly. He really was. But I was even more shocked after his behavior that he did next. He lifted the sleeves from the left hand and I really wanted to cry. His hand was covered by scratches. It wasn't blood on his hand, the blood was dried. It had to be done a long ago cause there were scars on that hand too, there were several scratches that weren't went to scars yet. \" now\" Gerard uttered. \"it's not that funny. You mustn't do that if you can compare mine with yours\" he finished and went to his table with a painful face. I got everything. It was what hurt Gerard. The scratches, they were hurting it. It was the reason of why Gerard didn't talk to me. He had to hide them and he had not to show me that something hurt him. Gerard was continuing the lesson. There was just a problem. Nobody was listening to him. I bet everyone were thinking about scars and scratched. It destroyed us, everyone. I couldn't think of anything but this the whole day. It was a reason of why he was so kind to me. I thought he was just like me. I wasn't self-harming, but he had to be like me cause only depressed people self-harm. After the lessons I stood up quickly and ran from class. I wanted to talk to Gerard. I really did. I wanted to know the reason of his depression. I saw him on the road, going home. \" teacher Gerard\" I shouted. He looked at me. \" please wait, just one minute\" I yelled and ran to him. \" yes, Frank. I know what you want from me. \" he told me as I went to him. \" oh, I'm sorry but I wonder.. \" I couldn't finish my words, Gerard interrupted me \"I know what you wonder Frank, my scars. Am I right?\" he asked and looked at me with his hazel eyes. \" yeah\" I said and I looked back at him. \" okay. Yeah. I self-harmed. I really didn't want to talk about it and I hid it when you went to me in the morning, remember?\" \" yeah, I wondered why didn't you talk to me\" I said and looked at the ground. He was so kind, well. His voice was so sweet. \"I knew you were going to thank me, but there's no need of it. I am just like you\" these last words were the words I was going to hear from Gerard at least. He was like me? No fucking way. He was adorable, I wasn't. \" no, you're not\" I started looking at him again\" you are a great person. I'm not\" I said. \" shhh\" Gerard said and put his first finger on my lip. It was so warm. My heart started beating faster. He was touching me, fucking touching me. \" don't say that. Well I have to go Frank. \" he uttered. \" maybe we can talk later. \" \" no please, I need to talk to you, teacher\" we started walking slowly. \" can you show me them? \" I asked him still thinking he'd say no. \" yes, you can\" he sighed and lifted his sleeves on both hands. I touched the scars and scratches. They were too many. I couldn't believe my eyes. He was looking at me carefully\" are you surprised?\" he asked \" yeah. I'm really amazed. I would never imagine you had done this. You., the one and only person who was able to defend me. \" I finished and kept walking. \" yeah, maybe that's the reason of what I've done to you and for you. I haven't done it for so log now. They are old. I'm not depressed anymore, or, I'mtrying not to be anymore\" he smiled a little. I smiled back . he had so beautiful smile. I melted everytime he smiled at me. His teeth, even his teeth were beautiful. I had never seen man and so beautiful. \" seems\" he started \" we have the same way home\" and looked at the road. \" yeah\" I agreed. \" so let's go and talk\" he said. \"there are too many things I want to know about you\" \" okay, then. Keep asking me. I can answer them all\" me smiled again. It was nearly the best day in my life. I would someone just like me. He was a teacher but it was okay. He was just 9 years older than me. I couldn't believe what happened today at school and it was so amazing. We waled until we didn't discover that his house ws on the other side of the way. Mine was on the left side and his was on the right side. We said goodbye to each-other and continued our way home.[Chapter 6] I wanted to go to school more now. Gerard was so warm to me, he always was explaining everything that I didn't understand. . Only several children were whispering something rude to each-other when I went through them. Weeks passed. I became more aware of math. Gerard was a great teacher, personally. He was great in his subject too. He was young but he could do everything better than others. He was great in his subject and in life too. So warm and sweet. During this time, I was very happy. So was my mom. She thanked Gerard for everything he'd done for me. Other teachers were so rude. If you couldn't understand something they were all shouting and calling you a\" stupid kid. \" Gerard wasn't like that. He could explain something 100 times to make you get it. He was my favorite teacher already and I bet so thought others too. But not James or Bill. They were angry with Gerard but he didn't care. Gerard didn't care about it. More children loved him than hated him and it was so special. During these weeks I wanted to study more, but only math, well I was studying well other subjects too but math became my favorite one. I did it the best. During this one month me and Gerard were getting very close but he was just a teacher and I was just a student. Nothing much. Everything went well until one day. I went to school early as usual, as I did it during this one month, after Gerard became our teacher. I didn't see Gerard. Usually he was coming to school early cause he always had the first lesson. I couldn't recognize him. He wasn't there. I was a little surprised of it. But I was even more surprised when Gerard didn't enter the class. Someone else. what the fuck? We had math. Our teacher was Gerard. I was confused and so were others as I noticed. \"what?\" everyone uttered. i became nervous. i started thinking if this teacher came here because Gerard left our class. He used to say that our class was so weak and that we were so noisy. he used to say that soon he may want to leave our class, but nope. it was impossible. Gerard wouldn't leave me here, alone. nope.. i didn't think so.. or rather, i didn't want to think so, didn't want to be so. i looked up at that teacher. i became so angry until he didn't say something that really made me calm down. \" don't worry guys, Gerard's your teacher again. \" he said and smiled a little. i laughed a little, because i thought he saw out worried faces..(besides some students.. former bullies) and so he said this. i imagine our faces at the moment and it made me laugh. I sighed. I was afraid Gerard wasn't our teacher anymore. I didn't even want to imagine this. \"but I have a bad new for you\" the teacher continued \" Gerard is ill. He can't come here until Monday, but I'm not even sure if he can come on Monday\" he said. Today was Thursday. One day. Only one day. I didn't want to be on a lesson without Gerard already. For me it meant the death of me. What now? Were everyone going to bully me again? Until Gerard wasn't here? That scared me a lot. I just discovered just how much I needed him and what he was doing for me and to me. Gerard was ill. Fucking ill. I imagined his face right now. He was always awake, alive and happy but now? He wasn't. he must have been sad now, ill. I imagined this and suddenly my heart started aching and I smiled. Huge smile covered my face. I was sitting at my desk all day. When Gerard was there I usually was talking to him, if he was in class. If he wasn't I was going outside and looking at him talk with others. Or I was sitting at my desk and doing math exercises. As I already noticed, math became my favorite subject. that day was so boring. I didn't even want to do math. I laid on my desk and tried to sleep. That day was horrible and very boring. After lessons I went home very fast. School was so fucking boring that day. I thought maybe I should go to Gerard's and see how he was but then I remembered I didn't know where he lived. I just knew where his crossing was. when I came home my mother was already home. She seemed worried a little. She greeted and asked me whet happened that I wasn't on my mood. \" nothing mom\" I answered. \" it was just bad day\" I said and went in my room. I wasn't hungry. I put my bag on my bad and set on chair. I looked at my guitar. I wanted to play on it. Usually when I was sad I played on guitar and it always helped me. Before, guitar was the only thing that made me feel better. No it's not the same. Now I had my math teacher, Gerard. I don't remember how long I was playing on it but I stopped when I heard someone's knock on the door. Usually we hadn't had many visitors, or any visitors at all. If we had, they were my mother's friends, but it was male's voice. A male. what did he want? He entered shouting to my mom. I half opened the door of my room to see who he was or what he was shouting about. He was also talking too fast. I couldn't hear what he was talking but I heard several sentences. \" when are you going to give me the money?\" he yelled. what money? What was he talking about? \" oh, I'll give you soon, just please give me some time. I'll have money soon from my work \" \" I don't care.\" He yelled again. \" if you don't give me the money, It will make me turn you out of the house. You and your little boy. \" he said. \" oh, no\" my mother begged \" please. Don't do it. I will give you it as soon as I get it. \" I don't care\" the man said. \" I need money in one week. \" he finished and went. My mom locked the door and rest against it. I couldn't see anything from half-opened door, but I could totally hear my mom sobbing. It killed me. She was so strong woman. She wasn't crying when I was there, she only cried when my father died and my heart was broken. I couldn't stand it. I wanted to kill that motherfucker for shouting to my mother and making her cry. I went to the room she was in. \"oh Frank. You're here?\" she said and smiled as usual. Acting like nothing's happened. That killed me more. She was hiding me that she was crying. \" everything's alright, honey, are you hungry?\" she asked and came to kiss me on my forehead. I stopped her. \" what's up?\" she asked, trying to hide the tears she had in her eyes. \"who was that guy?\"I asked and pointed to the door he had just left. \" oh, that?\" my mom looked at me \" he was your father's friend.\" \" no\" I said, nearly yelling. \" what?\" my mother asked . \" I wanna kill him, mom, you have to give him money to give us this house?\"I asked seriously. \" no\" ,my mom laughed \" why do you think so? It's not like..\" she couldn't finished as I shouted \"don't lie to me\" she looked surprised. \"tell me everything, I'm not a little boy anymore. I am sixteen, fucking sixteen mom\" I uttered and mother looked at me angrily. \" watch your mouth\" she said. \" okay. If I do this, will you tell me?\" I asked and looked at her eyes carefully. \" mom, I love you and I'm trying to show you that you aren't alone. My father's not here but I am. Tell me , please. \" I uttered and put my hand on her cheek. As I did so, my mom couldn't help crying and I saw a drop coming from her eyes down her cheek. It killed me and suddenly I wanted to kill myself. I couldn't look my mom sobbing in front of me. \"Frank\" she started, breathing hard. \" everything's not as easy as you think\" she said. \" we can live here only if I give that man money monthly. If I don't give him money, he will turn us out of this house \" she finished and placed her hand to dry the tears. I was shocked. I didn't know it. So if my mom doesn't give him money, he will turn us out of this house? but why? Was this house his? \" mom\" I started. \" is this house his own?\" I asked . \"it was, he just needed money, so he started selling this house to people, but not forever. We have to give him money in exchange for this house, get it honey? He'll turn us out of it if we don't give him money. Do you think we are the first ones living here? No, before us, there were people but they were turned out of it cause they couldn't give him enough money.\" She finished and looked away from me when she added following words \" when your father was alive, we could afford this but now Frank,\" she said and looked at me again with eyes full of tears. My heart was dead at that moment. I was useless. I couldn't help my mother. \" now? He's not anymore\" she continued\" he's not anymore and everything's hard. I can't stand this anymore. I can't afford this\" she said and couldn't help crying. She started crying in front of me. I put my arms around her and one tear drop fell off my eye. \" mom\" I started. \" don't cry please. I will help you\" I added and looked right in her eyes. \" I will start working so that we'll have more money to give that mother..\" I stopped at that word and looked down.\" No\" my mom nearly shouted. \" no way Frank. I will continue working. There is no way you're starting to work. I will do everything\" she said and dried her tears. \" everything's over, stop thinking about it. I can give him money\" she stood up \" but.. \" I started \"nothing\" she said and added\" now stand up and go do your homework. Tomorrow you have to go to school.\" She said and winked me her eye. she left I was sick. I didn't know what to do. This, everything was so tiring. I needed to go away from this place and rest somewhere alone. Think about everything. it was unbelievable. We were paying for this house during this time and I didn't know this until then. Well. I was ashamed of myself cause I couldn't help my mom. I was useless and worthless. That was fact. I needed Gerard now . tomorrow- another day without him. If he was at school I could tell him about everything. I needed to tell my worries and my problems to someone. If I wasn't gonna do it, then I could probably explode. I hated being at home and I hated being at school too. So what did I have to do? Where to go? Everything was so tiring and annoying. I was just 16 years old and already had so many problems. That day was terrible, horrible. Well I already didn't like it. I imagined Gerard, I tried not to think about it, but immediately his sick face came into my mind. I smiled a little thinking that he was now laying in his bed, sick. That made me excited. I was still sitting on the floor. I discovered it when something cold came to my body. The floor was cold. I stood up and decided not to go to the kitchen. I really didn't want to see my mom like this. The best thing to do at the moment was to go to my room and continue playing on my guitar.[Chapter 7] so little time. So many problems. I couldn't take this anymore. Everyday new problems were coming out. That felt horrible. That man appeared who announced that we had to give him money in exchange of this house, Gerard wasn't at school, I didn't want to study anymore(besides math of course) And this, everything, was so tiring. Now I found my mom crying in front of me because she couldn't do what she was doing anymore. I was useless and worthless. I couldn't help her when she needed me. My father died and she had no one to help her. It felt miserable. I missed my father too. He meant everything to me. I was destroyed when I got a new about him dying. I couldn't imagine my father dying. I though he was never going to leave me. I needed him the most now. He taught me to be myself, not to listen to the bullies. But it was so hard since he left me. I left alone in this world. The world was very ugly. Very ugly and I was scared. My father left me and I had no one. He did the main thing for me, helped me to find my inspiration in music. He bought me my first guitar, my current one. That was partly a reason of why I loved my guitar so much. I had only left the guitar from him. And I kept my guitar all safe. It meant a lot to me. Did I need any more reason to be depressed? Wasn't it all explaining everything? School was more boring that day. Math was the most boring. I didn't like that teacher. He was rude. We couldn't even understand what he was explaining. I noticed others didn't like him too. We couldn't understand anything. And he was shouting for it. Anyway. He was horrible teacher. I just realized how much I missed Gerard and how much I was missing when he wasn't next to me. I was sleeping on my desk all day. I only woke up on the lunch time. I took my lunch and set at table, alone. I was nearly finishing my lunch when I heard something from the pupils who were sitting at a table next to me. I heard the word \"Gerard\". I was interested in what they were talking about so I moved nearer to them so that i could hear. \"I don't like that teacher\" said James. I thought it was about new one who was instead of Gerard only these two days but I was seriously mistaken. \" neither do I\" said Bill and looked at his lunch. \"first of all what kind of name is Gerard\" he added. And I got angry. I didn't like the name Gerard too, but it had nothing to do with his erudition. They were fucking insulting Gerard. \"yeah, that's true. He's too stupid to be a teacher. Twenty fucking five years old. Too young and too stupid.\" He finished. I got very angry. He was twenty five years old but he was way better than 30 and more years old ones. He was great teacher. \"yeah\" James said and looked at Bill. \" also there are some rumours about him, you wanna know?\" he asked and narrowed his eyes. \"yep, tell me\" Bill said and looked at him impatiently. I looked forward it too. I was interested in what he was going to say. About Gerard. About teacher who was the best in our school. \"he's\" he said and sighed \"uh..\" he stopped again. I nearly shouted at him \"c'mon\" \"okay, he is \"he stopped again \"there are rumours that he's.. gay\" he finally finished. what? that was impossible. Gerard wasn't gay. They were rumours. Fucking rumours. Yeah. They hated Gerard and were spreading disgusting rumours about him. They were gross. yeah. there was no way he was gay. nope. it was impossible. \"what?\" Bill asked \" I don't think he is\" he said. \" but we hate him, so we can spread these rumours, can't we?\" he said and winked his one eye. \"great idea\" James said ' but if you ask me he may be, cause he has no wife\" COME ON which wife they were talking about. Gerard was 25 years old. He was young. I was upset about it. They were going to spread rumours about it. They were disgusting. Gerard wasn't gay. They were. Oh my god! It was impossible. I had to stop them. Gerard did lots of things to me. I couldn't do this. I had to stop them. Especially when they added something after all. \"okay, and when Gerard comes at school everyone will look at him.\" James said and laughed. I couldn't take this anymore and yelled at them. \"shut up you faggots. \" they looked at me surprised. I dared a lot. well, I wasn't afraid of them. At that moment because I was defending Gerard just as he was defending me from them. They were gross because they were spreading these rumours cause Gerard was mean to them at first day when he helped me. They were just gross. fucking gross. \"what?\" Bill stood up. James Did the same. \"yeah, I heard everything\" I said and looked up at them \" listen you, Gerard isn't faggot. You are\" I said and waited for them to hit me. But this time I wasn't going to let them beat me. I was doing this for Gerard. And that was all I needed. I was doing it for him. \"what do you want you little shit?\" James asked and I could tell you from the expression of his face that he was very angry. So looked Bill. \" so he just called us faggots?\" Bill asked. \"yep\" James replied. \" you are faggots yeah,\" I uttered \"Gerard isn't gay. You are stupid little kids who are angry with Gerard and want to do bad things to him to make everyone hate him.\" I finished and stepped forward them. Bill stepped forward me too and suddenly I felt something hard on my face. It was James. He fucking hit me. I touched the place on my face he just had hit. It hurt. But I wasn't going to let them bit me and bully me so I turned to them again and hit James for the first time ever. I was proud of myself at the moment until I didn't see James' angry face and they both didn't start beating me. I tried to hit them back but it was too scary and too hard. They were two. Two on one. Hitting me. It hurt a lot. I felt their hands hitting my stomach. I fell down. They started hitting their legs against me. I couldn't see anything. I wasn't regretting this at all, because I was doing it for Gerard. The last thing I saw was someone's legs. Someone was coming through us. Then I couldn't see anything and I don't remember anything. when I woke up I was laying on something. I looked around. I was at school. In teachers' room. I tried to stand up but I couldn't. Everything was hurting. My stomach, my face, hands-everything. I laied on sofa. I remembered what I'd done. But I really wasn't regretting . I was proud of myself. I finally hit them back but I got beaten again. in several minutes I saw a teacher coming to me. Michelle. My geography teacher. \"are you alright?\" she asked and put something cold on my forehead. \"no, I'm not\" I muttered and moaned from her action. It hurt me. \"I know it's hurtful but I have to do this. I have to touch your bruises because if I don't do this it gets worse and worse.\" She said and put another cold thing on my check. \"it hurts\" I uttered. \" I know \" she said. \" do you want to call your mom?\" \"oh, no\" I nearly yelled. \" I don't want her to get worried about me\" I said. \"oh\" she said. \" she has to see them anyway. Aren't you going to go home?\" She was right. I had to go home anyway and she was going to see it. \"not now\" I said. \" please\" added. \"okay, how you want\" she said and replaced that cold thing on my nose. It hurt a lot. I just wanted to get away from my school. I hated James and Bill so much. They were gross and I hoped they weren't going to spread that silly rumour about Gerard. I thought they weren't. Because I could tell everyone why they were doing this, but would they believe in me? There was such a mess in my brain. I was in the street ,walking. I was thinking a lot at the moment. I asked my teacher to let me go home. Everything hurt and she let me do this, but I really wasn't going to go home. I needed to walk. I wasn't going to show my mother my scars either. She was going to get worried about it. But she was going to see them anyway, but the later, the better. I was worried too of what I've done, but I was happy at the same time. I did it for Gerard. He did the same for me. I wasn't regretting anything. At the moment what I was thinking about was James and bill. They were fucking bitches. They were looking at me with eyes full of anger and pride. They were happy cuz they beat me. Haha. That was funny, because I wasn't even thinking about it in that way. I wasn't thinking I lost a fight at all. I didn't care I was stronger or them. I just did it for a right reason and for Gerard, that was what mattered to me. On the other hand, I was worried about my mom and I needed to get work to earn some money to help my mom. Maybe that was the only chance to help us. I was tired of this life. So many things happened to me in this month. I couldn't even handle it. That was too many and so depressing for me because I was just starting my life. Yeah![Chapter 8] not to be annoying, my mom started screaming about my scars. She started telling to me it was bad, that I'd done a bad thing but you know I didn't think so. She was so worried, she started talking about the bad boys, fighting at school everyday and bullying other children but I would never do that, because I was the one, who was bullied. It was terrible. Uh.. so.. she got nervous and then asked me why I'd fought to the guys but I couldn't tell her that it happened for Gerard, I was too frightened to say that. I didn't know what was the exact reason, but I thought I'd done this because of his great behavior. He always was defending me and always was helping me when I had trouble. He was the one who made bullies stop bullying me, so.. I think I did it for a right reason. Yeah.. that's right. for a right reason, because Gerard did the same for me. yup! But my mom wasn't stopping talking at all. She was asking me why i'd done this but i couldn't tell her the real reason. oh. i wanted to get away from my house. but i couldn't. because i didn't have any place to go to. i started lying. for the first time i lied to my mom. for the first time. She didn't deserve it, oh my god. she was so kind, so caring and took care of me, she loved me very much and trusted me but this time, i had to lie.. I told her that they started bullying me again, that they wanted to beat me again (yeah, i god beaten but i tried not to get), yeah, and that i didn't let them do that and tried to defent myself. yup. and i got beaten again. at least i tried to defent myself. Mom looked half proud, half sad, well, for the first time, i couldn't tell what my mom was feeling at the moment. as i thought, she thought i was stupid to dare this lot, but no, she could never ever think so.. Her expression was so mysterious. she narrowed her eyes and finally asked me if i was telling her the truth or not. i sweared that i was telling the truth and i think she believed. I was so ashamed of what i've done but i think that was okay, wasn't it? sometimes a lie is nesesarry. yeah, i know that lying is a sin and it's a bad thing but i was never a religious boy to be honest, i never believed in god that much, of course my mom was very religious but when my father died i stopped believing in god. So.. i lied, but sometimes lying is nesesarry, sometimes you need to do it and sometimes it helps you get through big problems. I was ashamed, something was killing me inside, but i tried not to care, i couldn't look at my mom in her eyes. Finally. She believed in me, and told me to eat something. i wasn't hungry at all but decided to eat anyway not to make my mom worry about me, she had many problems besides this, so i tried to eat something. oh yeah, and before i left school maths teacher said that Gerard wasn't coming at school next week too. that was another reason to make me feel sad, i didn't want to go to school. oh my god. i didn't even have any idea what i was doing before Gerard, what was i studying, how? oh.. i was confused. i still didn't get what i was feeling. i missed him so fucking much. i discovered that he meant the world to me. yeah. he helped me and did lots of things to me, slowly he was becoming my best friend, i could have never ever imagined that the teacher was going to be my best friend, best fucking friend. Yeah, Gerard may not think so, for him, i may be just a student, yeah, that's true but i felt something coming from him when we were talking to each-other. something magical that i hadn't felt to anyone else before. i thought i wasn't just a student to him, he'd done so many things to me, he wouldn't have done it if i was just a student to him right? that was illogical. i meant something to him. besides once when we were talking at a break, he told me that i was the only one who touched his scars.. i was really confused. why did he decide to show his scars to me? if i meant nothing to him. Right? Yeah, he was so lonely. Wasn't even talking to other teachers' at a break, was standing alone, just like me, i had no one to talk to too.. we were alike, we had same problems, he was a teacher, yeah, i know but first, he was only 9 years older than me and second, i've heard many times about teachers and students being best friends. That wasn't even a problem but who knows? maybe i was just thinking deeper and getting more than what reality was. Maybe he just did it for me to feel safe and not to bully me anymore, he's said once that he would have done the same for others too, but come on, i meant more than just a student to him because he helped me so many times. im not saying anything rude, i just wanna figure out what i mean to him, just a student or best friend. he was as lonely as me , everyone could see it, he wasn't talking to others at all, only talked to me. maybe because we were \"best friends?\" i was really confused , after Gerard appeared in my life, i got many problems, or rather, many things to think about. not problems at all. i just stareted thinking of him every day. that wasn't cool. After all, he was a teacher and i was just a student. we should all know our places, i was a dreamer, just a dreamer.. a person like me would never ever mean something to someone because i was useless and worthless. i couldn't even help my mother and now i wanted to be a best friend of a good person like Gerard? i was just a dreamer. Was it a good idea to phone Gerard? maybe i should phone him and ask how he is? we were very close this time and it would be rude if i wouldn't do it. maybe i should do this. Finally i decided to phone him. As i took my phone, something made me put it on it's old place again. I didn't do it. i remembered his phone number. it was so easy. He told me that i would be a really cool boy , if i could remember his phone number.. i told him that i could, but i haven't called him at least once, nope, this was first. i had to phone him anyway because i had to prove him that i still rememebr his phone number, though he told me his number only once, but it was so easy to remember. I pressed the button to call him. I waited with my heart beating faster and faster. oh.. i thought i was going to explode. i felt how i was getting all nervous and excited. i was cool n ow, but when Gerard was going to take the phone, i knew, i'd become nervous and couldn't say at least only one word. Someone answered. I prayed to god it wasn't Gerard, but on the other hand i wanted it to be him. the voice wasn't familiar. \"Hello?\" the voice said. \"um.. he.. oh..er.. hello\" i said, it wasn't Gerard, what should i do? maybe ask her to call Gerard? \"'i'm listening\" the voice said again, it was a woman's voice. but.. a woman? a woman in Gerard's house? was she his girlfriend? no.. she wasn't.! But how did i know? maybe she was. but i didn't want her to be, i thought Gerard was free. but.. Why was that a problem? Gerard was a free man, he could choose whoever he wanted and whoever he loved.. yet i was getting nervous because i didn't like a woman's voice in Gerard's house, maybe it wasn't Gerard's? yeah, maybe. or maybe it was his house but he lived with his mother, sister, don't know. but i didn't have much time to think because the voice repeated. \"please, who is there? tell me what do you want?\" \"um.. please.. er.. call Gerard, please\" i told her, no, probably i wouldn't have said it.. nope.. i didn't want to talk to Gerard, i was nervous but now everything was a bit too late because a woman went to call Gerard. \"Yeah\" Gerard said in the phone. oh my god. i missed his voice so much. he was so sweat, his voice, when i heard it i became nervous. he had such a sweat voice. \"I'm listening\" he said and waited patiently for me to answer. \"um.. teacher\" i said. i couldn't think of anything else at the moment. \"who is this? oh.. Frank?\" he asked and oh. my. god. he remembered my voice. he knew that i was Frank from my voice, he guessed it. \"Yeah..\" i uttered \"It's me, teach. and.. um.. i wanted to know.. you know? i just.. oh.. fuck\" i uttered.. i couldn't talk, what, was i 5 years old dorky kid. oh.. i hated myself now. \"Yeah, Frank.. im listening, what do you want baby?\" Oh, holy fucking shit. he called me baby.. oh god.. baby, fucking baby, i got even more nervous now. \"um.. yeah\" should i call him a baby back too? oh no.. was i an idiot? i was an asshole, what baby,, which baby.. oh.. \"teach, i just wanted.. um..\" and at last i brought myself to ask it to him.\"i just wanted to know.. oh.. how are you?\" i asked finally. wow, i dared it. \"oh.. thanks Frank\" he said and i felt the happiness in his voice. that was probably the best thing i've ever heard in my life. Gerard's happy voice, oh god. \"Frank, im so happy you remembered me.. im fine.. a bit sick.\" he said. Yeah. now? i didn't know what to say next. it was probably the worst feeling ever. so.. \"yeah.. now?\" he asked,. what now? nothing. \"um.. so.. bye teach.\" i said. omg.. i was an asshole. \"okay bye\" Gerard said. i felt a little excitement in his voice. he probably was amazed. what was our dialogue? i just asked how he was, not when he was going to get back or who that girl was.. oh yeah.. i was a bit angry of that woman, who she was? maybe this was a reason of why i did so? but why did it matter? he was a free man. yup. i didn't care at all. even if she was his girlfriend. or not.. she wasn't. i didn't want her to be. Oh.. i put the phone on it's own place. i needed to get away from house in open air. i warned my mom and went. i heard her saying not to go for my bruises but i didn't listen her. for the first time. everything happened today, i was daring a lot. but something that happened next surprised me even more.. While i was walking i saw a gay couple walking and holding hands. suddenly i felt how my heart was warming and i felt how excited i was getting that these two men were sharing love. but.. since when have i liked gays? nope. i hated them. but.. these 2 men were so lovely with each-other. Yeah.. I changed a lot since Gerard appeared in my life. maybe because he taught me that hating on somebody wasn't a good thing? Maybe.. he was becoming my hero.. he taught me so many thing. yet.. these 2 men.. oh god.. how lovely they were. how they were sharing love. i could watch them whole day but then they saw that i was looking at them and got away from me, maybe thought that i was homophobe? i wasn't, no, i was. i didn't love gays. nope.. i just liked these 2 boys. oh , fucking god. what was up with me? shit.. i was becoming other person and i liked this other one. that day was tiring. do you think everything was over with this moment? nope. even worse happened that night. i had a crazy dream that i was dying from the heart attack, but it wasn't a dream because my heart really hurt. oh.. i woke up. it bit faster. i felt a pain as if somebody was hitting onto my heart. i tried to stand up but it hurt. holy shit! it hurt so fucking much. i've never had a pain like this before you know? i just felt some pain but not like this.. simple pains.. this one was serious. it hurt.. i thought i was gonna cry now.. my eyes became full of tears.. i was trying not to cry.. i was a boy.. boys never cry! but fuck. i couldn't. i needed my mother now! \"mom!\" i yelled. i couldn't yell that loud.. there wasn't coming a voice from my mouth. i couldn't yell. somehow, mom heard it and entered the room. when she saw me like this, with one hand on my heart, got nervous. she had such a worried face, it was dark, (3 am) i couldn't see things well but i could see my mom getting worried. \"oh, god, honey, what's up?\" she asked and looked at me. \"mom, my heart.. uh.. it hurts so fuc.. sorry.. it hurts..\" i muttered. i really hurt so much and was beating like it was going to explode now. \"oh.. but why?\" she asked and turned the lights on. i saw a tear in her eye. that distructed me. suddenly we were disturbed by a phone call but mom didn't listen to it, didn't take the phone. \" answer it\" i said but no.. she wasn't going to do it. \"i will call a doctor\" she said . oh god.. it hurt so much. my eyes were closing. i could't see anything. i don't rememeber anything either. all i remember is my mom's face. when i woke up, i was laying on my bed. mom was laying next to me, holding my hand, i looked at her. i was feeling tired, my heart wasn't hurting now. i tried to stand up. mom woke up. \"honey.. oh, woke up? does your heart still hurt?\" she asked and kissed on my forehead. \"what happened mom?\" i asked. \"honey, you couldn't take these all and closed your eyes. i was too frightened, i tried to call someone but i couldn't because the phone switched off. the light was switched off.( my phone was depended on the light) then i decided to call a neighbour. she came and gave you something in your sleep. from then, you are laying here. so.. did that painkiller help you?\" she asked with the face expression that was telling that she was so fucking worried. \"i think yeah, mom, it doesn't hurt that much, or rather, it doesn't hurt at all... i think it helped.\" i said. \"honey, tonight.. only tonight.. please take it and i will do everything tomorrow. earn money and will bring you to the best doctor. you know, how much i love you baby, right?\" she kissed me and hugged me. i didn't know why.. but.. yea.. i knew.. i remembered Gerard when mom called me \"baby\". oh.. there wasn't time to think of him now. i was so worried too. my mom held me tightly and we both tried to fall asleep. i couldn't sleep. she was holding my hand and was whispering to me that everything was going to be alright. it was just a pain.[Chapter 9] next day was super fucking tiring. first of all, i had to wake up early. wake up is too taugh to say because i couldn't sleep all night. When i woke up, my mom was already getting dressed, i wondered why was she getting dressed? it was sunday, she didn't have to go to the work. Oh! i remembered everything. we had to go to the doctor. yeah. so.. i had to get dressed too. First thing i saw after my mom ,was money on the table. mom saw me and said: \"baby, woke up? okay, let's eat and then go to the doctor\" she smiled. i greeted her and asked. \"mom, how did you earn money?\" \"i asked our neighbour, i will give her back money as soon as i will be able to, when i get wages from my work.\" she said. \"mom, no, you didn't need to do it, it was just a pain, i've felt that before too\" i lied yeah, because the pain i felt before wasn't this hurtful. but.. she was so adorable. \"no. honey.. never lie to a mother, nobody can guess what you are thinking besides me, i can read everything you're thinking, never ever think your mother will leave you alone.\" she said and hugged me. i was so ashamed of my behaviour, that i lied to her yesterday. \"mom.. i love you\" i said and kissed her. probably a mother, is the best thing you can get in your whole life. you don't know how much your mother means to you unless you don't lose her. that was the last thing i wanted in my life. i loved her to death. i adored her. i ate just so that my mother wouldn't become worried about me. she ate too with me. she was so beautiful. she went through hard times in her life.. but she was still beautiful.. still nice and caring. when we finished we went to the doctor. i wondered where we were going because it was Sunday and on this day, everyone were having a break from work. she told me that we were going to the doctor's house. he was getting patiants in his house and he was a good doctor so.. We were going there. i was too lazy to go there because i knew nothing was up with me. that was just a pain. everyone have pains like this, don't they? if you went to doctor on every pain you feel somewhere, you'd be a fucking poor man right? that doctor lived so far way from our house. when my father was alive, he was driving us everywhere. no we had to go on foot because mom couldn't drive a car, besides we didn't have a car anymore cuz my dad died in an accident. finally we went there. my mom was still holding my hand as she was when i was a little boy. when we were crossing the road she was always holding my hand to avoid me from an accidnt. i didn't need that anymore but not to make her sad, i was still doing it. yeah. when we got there, mom knocked on the door. it was a big house. a man opened a door. he was an old man with glasses. i had a good feeling when i saw him. he looked such a sweetheart. \"oh.. hello\" he said \" come on\" and pointed us to come into his house. i was a bit ashamed. as i've said before, i was a shy person. there was sofa and a table in front of it. he pointed us to sit on that sofa. there were lots of needles on that table. pills, painkillers and medicines. i was scared. what was he going to do to me? was it going to hurt me? \"okay. \" he said. \"so.. what's up with this little boy?\" he asked and put his hand on my noice as if i was a lovely boy. i smiled. \"huh\" my mom started. \"well.. first of all he had some pains before with his heart\" she started telling my story. there was a paper on which there was written a patient's name. oh.. Matt( it was the doctor's name) had such a bad handwriting. i couldn't see what was rwitten there. i just saw that he was waiting for that patient now, there was written a time \"5:00 pm\" there were forty tive minutes to 5 so.. in fifteen minutes that patient was going to come here. was Matt that fast that he could see what was up with me in 15 minutes? that was a little funny. \"okay..\" Matt said. \"i see, so.. heart problems..\" mom nooded. \"okay little boy\" he said. \"come to me..\" added. he leaded me to the room where he had all the technology. i was surprised. yeah. i was a bit confused , heart problem needed something to look at your heart and discover what problem you have and i was connfused of how he was going to discover that. the answer was there. all the technology was there. after some minutes when we were done,and it took about 10 minutes, he brought me back to my mom. there wasn't any difficult process. he just looked at my heart with something to discover what problem i had. Me and my mom were waiting for Matt, who was in that room where he looked at my heart while i was telling mom what did he do to me and suddenly we heard a knock on the door. i was confused, should i open it? i stood up but mom said that it'd be a bad behavior so i sat back. there was a knock again. \"mom\".. i uttered \"he or she or whatever may be a patient\" \"no\" mom replied \" don't Frank, unless you don't have a permition to do it\" \"okay\" i said. i heard how the phone rang in the room where Matt was. he was talking to someone for some minutes and when he ended talking he yelled to open the door. i got.. that visitor called him to open the door. \"now you can open it\" mom smiled and let me stand up and open the door. i stood up and moved to the door. the knock repeated. \"im coming\" i said and tried to open the door and.. oh god.. There was standing someone, who was so familiar to me. HOLY FUCKING SHIT! It was Gerard. urgh. he was standing right there, in front of me., with a big smile on his face. \"oh.. teach?\" i said and couldn't move from my position. \"Frankie?\" mom called me. I couldn't even look at mom to see why she'd called me. \"um.. could you please let me come in?\" Gerard asked and smiled again. \"oh.. sure\" i said and moved so that he could come in. \"hello\" he said to my mom and stood there, next to the sofa. \"hello\" mom replied and looked down. i was confused. i hadn't seen Gerard for 3 or 4 days and i fucking missed him. he sighed and looked at the wall. he was serious. wearing all black as always and not smiling. his hair were laying on his eyes, he moved them but it still disturbed him. he was so fucking adorable. his eyes.. were wet..as if he was crying.. nope.. thinking that, killed me. i thought that Gerard hadn't ever cried, i was an asshole i know. he was a human too, there isn't any person who hasn't cried at least once in his ife, especially Gerard, who self harmed. oh.. those. words hit me. \"Honey\".. mom started \"sit here, please\" she said and pointed me to sit. Gerard looked at me. i tried to move and sit on the sofa but Gerard was standing there and i couldn't sit. \"oh.. \"he uttered.\"come on. \" added and moved left so that i could sit. when i sat, he moved forward me and sat next to me. mom asked me in my ear who he was, i said that he was my maths teacher. \"oh.. really?\" mom yelled. omg..shh mom.. no.. was she gonna talk to him? Gerard looked at her. \"you are a teacher of my baby?\" she asked and i thought i died at that moment. \"yeah, i am, you're mother of Frank?\" Gerard asked and smiled. his smile.. oh,, fuck. \"yeah.. i wanted to see you Gerard and thank you for everything\" mom said and started talking how grateful she was for him. \"you're welcome. i just love Frank so much \" he said.\" and yeah, i payed attention firstly on him when i first went in their class. he's not like others. i think he's a cool boy\" he said. you can't even imagine how happy i was to hear those words. he loved me back too, so.. i meant more than just a student to him.. yes! that was fucking cool. he meant world to me, a best friend, nothing more, you know that. they were talking for a long time. about what kind of boy i was in maths, my personalities and blah. Finally Matt came in. Gerard stood up. \"Gerard\" Matt said \" come on, homie.\" he said and they shook hands. i knew why Gerard was there, because he was sick.. poor boy.. huh? i was calling a boy to my teacher. no. something really was up with me. \"where's our answers?\" mom asked to Matt. \"oh.. here it is\" Matt said and gave us a paper. \"so?\" my mom asked. \"nothing much\" Matt smiled. \"it's just that he has lots of problems. he's a child yet. his heart can't take these much. what's up with him? i guessed that he has lots of problems. that's the main reason that caused this pain\" he said. yeah. i had lots of problems. he was so right. \"um.. i try to make him not to worry about me and..\" mom uttered \" i dunno, you know that Max (name of my father ) died a long ago and..\" she couldn't finish that sentence. Gerard had a face that told me that he felt so bad for me. \"okay.\" Matt said \" try not to make him worry and i wrote all the medicines that are needed for him to take. buy them and give him as i wrote on that paper\" he finished. \"okay\" mom said and suddenly she moaned. we all looked at her. Oh god. she'd left money at home. that was funny. omg. \" im sorry Matt, ill be here in five minutes\" she said. i told her that i could go with her too but she said that we had to run, so my heart would hurt me again. (Matt also told me not to tire) \"don't worry. \" Matt said \" and don't hurry up, i need Frank here just to count his pulse. we're not done yet. so.. you can go and bring money while i finish my work with him\" he smiled and winked his eye. \"okay\" mom said \"i'll be back soon\" she said and left. \"what's up with Frank?\" Gerard asked \"i have heart problems\" i replied. \"oh.. that's okay\" he uttered \"it's okay in your age\" he smiled and continued speaking to Matt about his problems. as i saw, he had a flu and was cold. Matt was going to check his breathing and listen to it to see if he had a pneumonia. \"take your shirt off\" Matt said. Gerard took it off slowly and gently. he had a white body, his skin was so pale. i wanted to hug him and put my head on his pale body. i got nervous again. i couldn't make my eyes not look at Gerard's body. it was so attractive and thin and uh.. it just was so beautiful. have you ever heard a beautiful body? oh my god. he moaned as Matt put the cold equipment to hear the voices while he breathed in his lungs, he told Gerard to breath hard. Gerard started breathing hard. i don't know why but i liked the voices he made, his hard breathing. he looked at me, i tried to look away not to make him see that i was looking at his perfect body and face and eyes and don't know. he was just perfect. he was like.. a fallen angel? i tried not to look at him but it was so hard. \"okay\" Matt said and stood up. \" you can put your shirt on.. i'll check something and will be back in a few minutes \" he said and went to the room where he had all the technology. let's call that room a \"technology room\". we were left alone. \"oh.. \" Gerard said. \"what?\" i wondered. \" i didn't think you had heart problems. why haven't you told me that before?\" he asked as he finished putting his shirt on. looked at me. i got confused. \"um.. oh..er.. im sorry\" i said and looked at him finally. He was looking at me like, i couldn't tell you what he was thinking. \"it's okay\" he said. \"next time, don't hide anything from me okay?\" he said \"but..\" added. \"but?\" i asked. \"Frank, no. you aren't obliged to tell me everything. i mean, im sorry. you can hide, i . oh.. okay, im sorry\" he finished and it made me feel so sorry. i added something to make him not worry. i wanted to tell him everything because, he was my best friend. yea, i didn't know if he thought same about me too but.. well.. \" no no, it's like.. i didn't know myself that i had heart problems.\" i laughed. it wasn't anything you had to laugh at, but, well.. fuck.. i was so fucking confused. \"okay\" Gerard said. \"it's okay. once and for all we are a teacher and a student. right?\" he said and i felt something dropped in my stomach. i was just a student to him? that was immposible.. well.. that felt fucking horrible. maybe he meant something different? or? oh.. that made me sad. \"yeah.\" i said , a little like i was angry and continued looking at the floor. i was very angry, so.. it meant nothing to him what we said and did. i got beatten for him, he defended me, let me touch his scars. it meant nothing? fucking nothing. i sighed. i didn't want to stay there anymore, i didn't want to go home, to school. i wanted to die. \"Frank?\" he asked. \" are you alright? \"yeah, so fucking happy. \" i said.. \" do you even know that i got beaten for you? why don't you even ask what's up with me? i have fucking bruises. why aren't you interested in what happened? i nearly yelled. he looked surprised and confused. i was happy for what i did at that moment but then i was like \"shit.. what have i just done. i am an asshole\". that was fucking incredible. i yelled to my teacher. wow. \"Frank, i .. oh.. i haven't noticed. oh.. let me see them \" he said and stood up to touch my bruises. i moved and didn't let him touch me. \"Frank, why did you get angry?, come on\" he uttered and tried to touch me eyes but i moved again. he sat next to me. \"what happened?\" he asked and looked at me persistently. \"nothing that much. \" i answered, still angry about his answer. \"oh god. Frank, tell me\" he said firmly. \"nothing, i said nothing\" i was still angry. \"why are you angry?\" he smiled. \"what's so funny?\" i asked, i was fucking angry and he was fucking smiling. \"you got angry for my asnwer that i said you are just a student to me?\" he laughed. i looked at him surprised. what was so funny? was he a fucking psychopath? \"oh god. Frank, you got it wrong, baby, i didn't mean it. i said .. i just.. oh\" he uttered. \"listen , i meant that you are student and i am a teacher, not that you mean just a student to me, or..\" he stopped. \" or.., that i mean just a teacher to you.\" he finished and smiled. i became less angry. that literally helped me but i didn't want him to think that i really got angry about that. i couldn't hide on the other hand. \" nothing's happened\" i said to him. \" i just.. well.. Bill and James said something rude about you and.. and i tried to defend you, but..\" i stopped and pointed him to my bruises . \"oh.. poor boy.. im so sorry. well.. Frank you didn't have to\" he said and he looked really worried. \"why did you do this? now i will feel guilty. does your mother know? oh Frank!\" he muttered. so? he was disappointed in me that i did so? another thing to get angry about. Gerard? \"so, you think that i did a wrong thing?\" i asked ironically. \"no , i don't mean it. oh.. thank you\" he said . \" what did they say?\" he asked. \"well.. nothing that much, just a fucking rumour about you\" \"rumours? tell me Frank, i need to know.\" \" okay, they said that you're gay, oh my god, they are fucking stupid people, how did they think so? oh.. okay.. leave it here, please.\" i said and looked at him. Gerard went pale. he seemed like he was going to explode. \"oh..\" he uttered. i was confused. maybe he got worried because it was a fucking lie and a disgusting thing to blame. he started rubbing on his leg, went wet. i really got confused . what was up? \"teach,\" i asked and put my hand on his arm. \"im alright, Frank\" he said. \" i just..\" \" i get, this is a disgusting thing to blame right?\" i asked, he looked at me with poor expression after i said this. he looked like he was worried,. \"teach, don't worry, they won't do this.\" i said and smiled. he tried to smile too but this was a fake smile, you could see it. when he was smiling his eyes were brigthtening and his whole face was smiling but now.. i could say this was fake. \"Frank.\" he started. \"im alright, let's move on okay?. so.. you got beaten for this?\" i nooded, he felt so sorried. i saw. \"oh.. im so sorry Frank. oh.. that bruise on you lip. oh, im so sorry.\" he touched my eyes to check if my bruises hurt or not. his hand was so warm and sweat. he moved his fingers on my cheek where i had second bruise. he was touching me with his hand. i didn't know why but i suddenly looked at his lips. they were so slimy. everytime i looked at them, they were wet. he moved his hand on my cheek and looked in my eyes. i saw his hazel eyes. they were so beautiful. i got nervous. i was like this, everytime we were this close. i remember once we had something like this in teacher's room. he moved his hand now on my lips. i moaned because it hurt. \"teach\" i started. \"shhh\" he said and put his first finger on my lip to make me keep silent. oh.. his hand was so warm. i put my right hand on his hand, which he was touching my lips with. he smiled. have i ever told you how beautiful he was when he was smiling? he was the most adorable thing when he was smiling. even his teeth were beautiful. oh. i wanted this minute, to last forever, but why? was i retarded? i was touching a man and fucking enjoying it. Gerard moved closer to me, so that we were nearly touching our noses. he moved his hand on my body. i was feeling his breathing. i felt it. i got so fucking nervous, i tried to move from my current position but i couldn't. i wanted to stay there. i fucking wanted. i didn't really care that i was in other person's house and that he might see us. the only thing that mattered to me at that moment was Gerard and his lips that were drawing my attention so bad. he looked at my lips, so did i. but his eyes. they were so beautiful. holy fuck! i was talking about man. i was supposed to talk about girls like this, but.. Gerard was so adorable. he moved his face closer, even closer and now.. oh god.. i thought we were.. we were going TO KISS? oh... no.. i didn't want that, but i wanted. i wanted not to want to kiss him but deep inside my heart i really wanted. i didn't even try to move. i was there, sitting next to him and going to kiss him? my teacher, my fucking teacher. suddenly he moved farther. i was confused. he was trying to get away from me? there was no way i was letting him get away from me. but he was going to get away. our noses weren't touching and weren't that close anymore. he was fucking stopping everything. i couldn't let him. i put my arms around him and tried to pull him closer. he didn't deny. i was going to kiss him and nothing on the Earth could make me deny it. nope. not that time. maybe i was going to regret it then, but i didn't care.i wanted it to happen. i pulled him closer and closer until our noses weren't touching again. he looked confused. that was okay. he was really adorable when he was confused and didn't know what to do. i wanted to smile but i tried not to smile, because it could have made him to get away again. oh.. how beautiful he was. he was looking at me right in my eyes. his hazel eyes were just the cutest things in the world. i moved closer and tried to touch his lips with mine. and.. Matt came in with looking on his papers. Gerard got up quickly and tried not to show Matt how excited he was. i moved too. i thought i was all red as Gerard's lips. they were red. why were they red? i smiled. \"guys, i think you didn't become bored \" Matt smiled and went to sit in front of me. \"give me my papers quickly\" Gerard uttered \"and let me go please\" he said, he was still excited. i was too. i stood up and looked at the window to see if my mom was coming or not. she wasn't. i wanted to get away from here. oh god. i nearly kissed a man! Yeah, it would be okay if i didn't want this and Gerard made me do it but no, i fucking wanted to happen. Gerard got away but i pulled him back to kiss him. oh, thank you Matt, oh god. i didn't know and probably didn't want to imagine what could've been if Matt hadn't came in. \"why, Gerard?\" Matt asked. be hear please, let's talk about something until i check Frankie's pulse\" he said and looked at Gerard from his papers. \"no, i have to go, Lily is waiting.\" Gerard sai. So.. Lily. that was a name of that girl. wow. \"oh.. Lily, right..\" Matt smiled. \"of course, she is alone at home right now, right? go to her come on, she needs your love, but not now\" Matt said. \"i'm not done yet. fucking shit. Lily was his girlfriend. yeah. oh god. that was probably the worst thing i've ever heard in my life after my father's death. Gerard had a fucking girlfriend. that was unbelievable. \"she's better\" Gerard answered and looked at me. \"she is trying\" added. i tried not to look at him. we were going to kiss minutes later. i couldn't look at him in his hazel eyes. \"oh.. i forgot something\" Matt said and stood up. \"wait, where are you going?\" Gerard asked and tried to stop him. \" i will be here in some minutes Gerard\" Matt said a little confused. he left. and we were alone again in one room. Gerard sat on the sofa in front of me and looked at the wall. he was trying not to look at me. i was so ashamed even to be in one room with him, i hadn't done anything like this ever in my life before. this was so embrassing. god. if he was thinking that i was gay. like, imagine. it wouldn't be surprising. i did a horrible thing to him. but i hadn't started this. he was the one who started everything. oh. i stood up and went to the window to make sure he wasn't able to see me. he was breathing hard, still nervous. i sighed and tried to think about something else. but i couldn't. i'd done a horrible thing just minutes ago with my fucking teacher. how was i even supposed to study lessons and do my honework at home? i was all confused. i was rubbing my hand on other one and trying not to look at Gerard who was still breathing hard. i really wanted to know who that Lily was on the other hand. i sat on my old place again. Gerard stood up and started looking for something. he was looking everywhere. i wondered what he was doing. after some time, when he couldn't find what he was looking for, he looked at me. i wondered what he wanted. \"Frank.\" he started. \"um..\" he said and went all red. i couldn't look at his eyes. i had to but i was trying to avoid it because i knew they were driving me crazy. \"um..can you please stand up?\" he asked. \"me?\" i said and looked at him confused. \"yeah.. um.. my phone..y'know.. i don't know where it is and.. i think.. uh.. you are sitting on it..\" he finished and didn't smile. just continued looking excited. \"oh..\" i muttered. \"im sorry\" i said and stood up. the phone was there. Gerard tried to bent to take it. i saw his body. oh. i looked away. he was next to me, touching my hand as he was taking his phone. when he took it finally uttered that he was sorry and went to the door to knock to Matt. as he did so, Matt went in. \"what's up Gerard?\" he asked. \"im already done. Gerard.. now time of the needles.\" he laughed. \"what? no way Matt, there is no way im agreeing on the needle, you know it.\" Gerard half yelled. he was afraid of needles? oh god. wasn't he adorable. \"but.. Gerard\" Matt uttered. \"no Matt\" Gerard said and tried to get away. it was so funny how they were fighting on this, Matt was trying to catch Gerard but couldn't. Gerard was so fast that Matt couldn't catch him. they were running all around the room. oh.. if you justs aw how adorable he was. my fucking teacher was running away like a child just because of needles. At last.. Gerard agreed on needles and as Matt put the needle in his skin Gerard moaned. he nearly cried. oh.. when Matt asked why he was so afraid of needle he answered that he didn't like anything inside his body. ugh. didn't it sound a bit too gay? like.. okay, forget. as Matt was done and Gerard sighed from the pain, my mom entered the room. she was back. \"oh..\" she started. \"Matt, im here\" and smiled. \"were you running?\" Matt asked and smiled back. \"yeah, i was trying to come as fast as i could\" \"there wasn't any need of it\" Matt said and took the money. \"are you done?\" mom asked. \"nope, no.\" Matt said and pointed me to follow him. after some time we were done. ugh.. i was so tired. Gerard was still there because Matt wanted to talk to him after we were going to go home. oh.. my mom didn't have any clue of what his \"saint\" son did here an hour ago. oh.. i felt guilty, but.. there was only one thing that made me regret what i nearly did. that was the fat that Gerard might've thought that i was gay. but i didn't think so. i needed to get away from there as fast as we could. we said goodbye and prepared to leave. mom thanked Matt. i was still interested if Gerard was coming at school or not. that was just that i didn't understand what that new one was explaining. just this. so.. i wanted Gerard to come back quickly just for this. i tried to ask but couldn't. Garard looked at me until i left the room. i looked at him too. he looked away and i did so too. said goodbye to Matt, thanked him and left his house. the house in which i nearly kissed Gerard. oh.. that was fucking tiring and funny , wasn't it? but for me, it meant other thing. not that i was gay. there was no way i was gay but.. how did i know? i've never liked a girl, neither a boy. but. oh. what was i thinking about? i wasn't gay, nope, i wasn't. i was sure, not so sure, but i thought i was. oh.. i was so fucking confused.[Chapter 10] so we left. i was really fucking amazed that day. i did something that i hadn't done in my entire life, before. that felt fucking.. well.. if i said terrible, it wouldn't be right, because i didn't really think it was terrible, i just wanted to think so, wanted to make myself think so. i was fucking bastard. Gerard avoided me, didn't want to talk to me. he was all right. i did a horrible thing, but.. okay.. i didn't do that. he started right? he started kissing me (thank god we didn't kiss there). yeah. he was the one who came near me just to touch our noses. i lost control. i was like that always. when i was near Gerard, i lost all the control, i was confused. fucking confused all the fucking time. well.. i was like.. somewhere else all day. thinking about things. mom told me that i was confused and not there but flying somewhere else and she was right. i was ashamed of my behaviour. if she only knew what Gerard and I did there. oh.. i had to hide something again from her. that became okay. i was lying to her almost every day and i didn't like that. but what could i do? i had to hide cuz i'd be a phsycho if i told her what i did there. but.. the most confusing fact there, was that i wasn't regretting. the only thing that made me sick was the fact that Gerard might've thought that i was gay. but i wasn't. i was sure. if i was gay i wouldn't like girls right? but there was a problem. i've never liked girls. neither boys, but, Gerard was something else to me like.. okay, forget, he was just a teacher to me, no, not just a teacher. a best friend. exactly. a best friend. I was behaving like an idiot. only idiot could do thing like i'd done with Gerard, and didn't regret then. Okay. if we forgot everything such as shame and thinking and etc. blah. why did i wanna kiss anyway? when he started touching our noses, i lost control. it'd be stupid if i kissed him, thanks to Matt. but why am i calling myself stupid? Gerard started everything? aren't i right? he started pulling me closer and driving me crazy. he was the one who put his arms around me and made me feel his breathing. i wasn't stupid. he was. yeah. he was stupid for starting everything. another thing that mattered to me at the moment was Gerard's reaction. what was he thinking? was he thinking like me? was he regretting everything? oh. god. i just wanted to fall asleep and never wake up. huh. and guess what? tomorrow was Monday. school. fucking school. i had Maths. ugh. \"Frankie\" suddenly i heard the voice. my mom. she was the one calling me Frankie. my father used to call me, my mom didn't, but when my father died she started using to call me \"Frankie\". i wasn't opposite of this. i liked when she called me Frankie. it was her thing. No one used to call me Frankie other than her. \"yeah, mom\" i said. \"baby, aren't you hungry?\" she asked. that was the usual question from her. she always asked me if i was hungry. \"nope, mom, im not\" i answered. \"come here\" she said. i was in my room. stood up and went to her. \"Frankie, now tell me what's up baby. come on\" she said. i was confused. how did she know that something was up? \"nothing's up mom. im alright\" i said and tried to go but she stopped me and said \"don't try Frank. i repeat. you can't hide anything from me. i am your mother. i can read everything from your eyes. i don't exactly know what's happened but i know something has.\" she said and narrowed her eyes. \"mom\" i said. i couldn't tell her what happened. i needed to lie again. well. fuck. \"nothing's happened mom. im just a little tired.\" i told her. \"Frank\" mom didn't believe in me \"baby, are you afraid?\" \"afraid? of what mom?\" i asked. \"of your heart, baby. you are behaving strange since last night. baby. if you're afraid of your heart?, tell me, please\" she uttered. huh? i really wasn't afraid of my problems with heart. that was stupid. but since i couldn't tell her what happened i preferred to tell her it was my heart that made me behave strange. \"baby\" she pulled me to her. \"nothing's wrong. see what doctor said? you'll be fine. it's just that you're a teenager. your heart can't take this much baby, that's all. nothing's wrong. i promise. Frankie..\" she hugged me. i felt guilty and ashamed of what i did but it'd be worse if i told her that i nearly kissed a man so.. it was better. well.. the only thing i was thinking about in my mother's arms, instead of thinking about her, was school. how was i going to see Gerard next day? how was i going to tell him something? look at his eyes? how was he going to react when seeing me? was our friendship going to end? if so.. then i'd be better off dead, because without Gerard, i didn't wanna live. he was the one encouraging me to keep on living and not being afraid of walking this world alone. well.. that day was, like, a \"thinking day\" for me. i couldn't avoid thinking about Gerard. i tried. several times but i failed so bad. well.. id i told you that day was good, i'd be lying. i had to do homework, like imagine? imagine doing homework when having problems like me. this is why i hated my life so much. okay. let's leave it here. going to school was even harder. i couldn't wake up early because my mom had to go to shop . as i already told you, i couldn't wake up by myself. fuck. i was gonna be late at school. that was feeling so bad. i ran and tried to go there as fact as i could. well. when i got there, the bell was already rang. huh, i was so lucky. oh god. i tried to go to my class. \"Frank\" someone shouted. i looked around. it was an English teacher. \"why are you late?\" she asked \"um.. im sorry teach.\" i told her and looked down. \"okay, go to class\" she said and continued going on her way. i knocked on the door. my heart was beating soo fast. we had Maths first. i was going to see Gerard. someone stood up... and the door opened. that was literally the worst thing that was going to happen in my life. Gerard was standing at the door. \"um..\" i couldn't say anything. \"uh.. Frank.. you..\" he started. he was so confused. haha. i already mentioned that but again, confused Gerard was the best thing in the world. \"im sorry.. for.. um.. y'know? for being late.\" i said. \"come in.\" he uttered and tried not to look at me. i came in and went to my desk when Bill pulled his leg out. i was so confused ,didn't see it and was cought on his leg. \"hey.\" Gerard uttered and tried to catch me. he put his arms around me. i was nearly falling on the floor when he caught me. i looked up at him. we were close to each-other again. i was resting in his arms. his hazel eyes looked entirely green. he was breathing so weakly. oh poor boy. maybe because he had a flu. oh.. that warmed my heart so much. but.. there was no time for this. \"um.. Frank stand up\" he said and got away.\" and Bill.. don't you dare doing this again\" Bill said something, Gerard was far away from him and couldn't hear. i went to my desk and set down. Gerard was silent for some minutes. then stood up, went to desk and started speaking. \"i know guy, that there was someone else instead of me. well. he explained very difficult paragraph, it's too difficult. did you guys understood it?\" and looked around. everyone understood. besides me. why not? they were preparing with other teacher, i couldn't prepare because i didn't have money for it. was that fear, huh? \"well. if someone didn't, i can prepare them at home. now, let's check how you understood it. now? who wants to come to the blackboard?\" everyone raised hands, besides me of course. that was one of the tasks that was needed in exams, i was in trouble. Gerard looked at class. \"okay. Jessica, come to the blackboard and do this exercise.\" he said and looked at her. well. that lesson was super fucking boring. i just had to watch other students being geniuses when i knew nothing about that . my education in maths went bad. when we had a control writing, i got D. i was always getting A-s. now? i got D, okay. leave it here. in another one i got C. and my mom thought i was her genius. Gerard was dissatisfied of my results. well. he wasn't saying anything to me, but i could see. once when we had maths, we were still on that paragraph. ( Gerard said it was the most important task in maths) he was calling the students out again. \"now?\" Gerard asked. \"same students every day?\" he asked and i felt how he looked at me. i was looking down. i didn't want him to call me out. \"okay.\"he started. \"Frank come to the blackboard please\" he finished and the feeling i felt right then was worse than the feeling when someone hits you in your fucking face. i stood up and went slowly. there was 25 fucking minutes left till the bell. i couldn't last walking to the blackboard for 25 minutes. i was caught. i was fucking caught. \"Frank, please come here\" Gerard said. \"now, do this exercise please, number 16\" and pointed me to the book. i took it. yeah. i understood something students when they were doing exercises on the blackboard, but, that wasn't enough. the one, on which Gerard had pointed me to do, was super fucking difficult. i took a chalk, but, i knew i couldn't do that, so put it again on it's former place. \" i don't know\" i uttered. \"what does that mean?\" Gerard asked. \"you can't do that?\" \"yeah, im sorry teach. i can't do this. i didn't understand, im sorry.\" i uttered and looked down. \"okay, Frank. sit there, please.\" he said. i was so ashamed but there wasn't anything i had to be ashamed of. i didn't understand. i wasn't a genius. okay. i left it here. i didn't wanna think about it. *** i was walking home after the lessons were finished. Gerard said that someone who didn't understand could go to his house but.. no.. that was a crazy idea. first of all, that needed money. i didn't have money. \"Frank\" someone screamed. i looked around. well. who would it be if not Gerard? i waited for him. several days passed after that \"nearly kiss\" moment and i wasn't that ashamed of what i did there. neither was he. maybe. i was looking down. \"Frank, er.. um.. okay\" he said. wtf? \"i have to go somewhere but til i go, i want to tell you something okay?\" i nooded once. \"Frank, you didn't understand that task. everything that comes after this issue, needs this one to be solved. \"but..\" i started. \"stop. okay. let me tell you. you are the best student in class. er.. yeah. and.. well.. Frank, you need to train for this task so hard. well. you can come to my house and i can train you , if you want. i just give you an advice. \" he finished and looked at me. \"teach. ugh. i am in trouble\" i started. \"i really can't understand but.. i don't have money. i don't have enough money to pay. \" i said and looked away. \"be shamed of yourself Frank\" he told me a little offended. \"how do you think, will i take money from you?\" oh.. that was fucking impossible. no, i couldn't. \"im sorry but, i can't, no, it's not that i don't want, i just, for free? teach, i can't\" i couldn't look at him. \"Frank. i don't make you do this. it's your choice. i just don't want to lose you, you are a really intelligent boy. i want you to understand everything in maths because i am in hopes of you in exams. Frank. i think it's better if you do\" he said. \"but i can't for free, teach\" i muttered. \"oh.. okay. do you wanna pay?\" he asked ironically. i kept silence. didn't say anything, because i didn't have money. \"i have to go, see you tomorrow at 5 pm. im waiting for you\" he said and left. he really had to go somewhere, he was hurrying up. should i go? well. i needed a prepare. that was fact but, for free? when i asked mom, she said that i had to agree, because he was a teacher, he didn't have to do this and still, he did so. yeah. i had to appreciate that. well. we decided to go. i had to go to Gerard's tomorrow. i had no maths that day at school. well. i hoped everything was going to be okay again in maths.[Chapter 11] NOTE: song used here is \"The Fray-You Found Me\" NOT MY WRITTEN. it'd be better if you turned the song on while reading the lyrics, or while reading the whole chapter. it's your choice. well. that song's about Frank. now read it and thank you 3 i was on the road. walking to Gerard's house. he once told me where he lived. i put the best clothes i had on, brushed my hair, teeth, well. i was super ready. i was going to the teacher to study but i was dressed as if i was going to a very special place, but going to Gerard's was very special to me. the only thing i was thinking about was how i was gonna behave there. was he living alone? no, oh what i forgot. his fucking girlfried. Lily. i didn't exactly know she was his girlfriend or not but she most likely had to be. i was nearly there. he had two-storey house. it was white, not so big, medium. i went in the yard. was calling him a good idea? or was just knocking on the door better? i preferred the second one. i knocked on the door once. nobody answered. i repeated again and knocked twice. the door opened. \"Frank\" Gerard said. his face brightened. \"come in. please. im happy you came\" he told me and pointed me to go in. \"hello teacher\" i said and went it. he was dressed all in black as always. he was dressed so simply. his hair was laying on his eyes as always. you could tell that he hadn't brushed his hair. it was so funny. \"Frank. why are you looking at me like that?\" he asked laughing. \"or maybe, because my hair disturbes me and im crushing at things?\" he laughed and looked at me. \"no, no,\" i said immadietly. \"okay.\" he told me .\" sit down please. what do you prefer. doing exercises here? or in my room?\" oh. i didn't want in his room. it felt like. well. it felt strange, but we were going to study. nothing more. oh. god. i was an asshole. \"Frank? \" he asked. \"are you alright\" \"ugh.. yeah. i mean. er.. i prefer here..\"i told him, but then added \"how do you prefer? \"i don't mind. we can study here, we can study there. there's not any difference right?\" he sat right in front of me, at the table and told me to give him my maths book and take my notebook. \"Frank\" he started. \"we are friends right?\" i nooded. \"okay. there's not anything to be shamed of in teaching free. please. do whatever you want here.\" he smiled, \" yeah. and. our topic. it's thing that's needed in every exam , Frank. i'm really surprised that you didn't understand it.\" \"teach\" i told him. \"it's just that, well. i wasn't understanding before you either. i don't know. i only see things that you explain.\"i smiled and looked down. \"really?\" he got excited.\"that's cool, okay\" he started searching for the page, where there were many exercises to work on. as he explained and moved his lips, i couldn't look at something else but his slimy lips. i wasn't going to understand like this. all my attention was taken away by his mouth. \"Frank.. aren't you listening?\" he uttered. \"yeah, yeah, i am.\" i said. also, i got something from what children were doing on the blackboard and after Gerard's explaining it wasn't that hard to understand. after some time, i really felt tired. i was at school today, did lots of homework, plus this. i got really tired. i sighed. \"are you tired?\" Gerard asked. how could he guess everything about me? he was like, he knew everything, how i felt, what i was thinking, what i needed. he was a genius to me. \"yeah. a little.\" i uttered.\" teach, i was at school, did homework..\" i couldn't finish my sentence. \"i know, i know, Frank, no need to explain.\" \"okay. can i go now?\" i asked. though i didn't wanna go. i wanted to stay there, to talk to him, to do stuff with him. i needed to be next to him. fortunately i saw he didn't wanna let me go either. \"oh, Frank, don't go please, stay here for a little while. let's go something okay? if you want of course.. \"added. oh. god. i wanted of course. i decided to stay there for a little time. i thought it was little. \"teach. \" i started. \" we always talk about myself. let's talk about you please\" \"me? my life isn't interesting Frank.\" \"but i wanna know please\" i stood up and sat next to him. \"okay. what do you wanna know exactly?\" he looked at me smiling. \"where were you living before you arrived here?\" i asked. \"well. in New York. i had my job. i was an artist, i drew a lot. i draw a lot now too, don't think i stopped just because im a math teacher. well. i didn't have many friends. my life there.. \" he stopped. \"was... awful. it's a big city, you know it. if you've ever been in New York you would know that there are many criminals, many accidens, etc. well. i didn't like living there. especially, since, my parents died.\" he stopped for a while. sighed and then continued speaking. \" died. i've been in an accident twice. had 2 fines to pay. like, 200 euros. i was so unlucky. every time something happened to our family, i was the one getting hurt. you already know that.. i self-harmed. but it was a while ago. i do not self-harm now, since i first went in your class. i think i found someone.\"he said this final sentence a little quietly. \"then?\" i was really interested in what happened after his parents' death. \"then, my brother died. since my parents died, we was so lonely, feeling awful. became so depressed and started only living in his room. then one day when i wanted to wake him up.. i couldn't..i couldn't wake him up. he was dead. doctors said that he was too young for this shit. for being so depressed in his age. he was only 17 not more. \" somehow i remembered myself. i was sixteen, that was the difference. i'd lost my father too. \"yeah. he died. he meant the world to me. after his death, i became more depressed. i couldn't draw. couldn't do anything. i needed to get out of that city. i had only left Lily. she means everything to me. we decided to arrive here, in New Jersey. i didn't wanna be an artist, because it reminded me of old times, so i decided to be maths teacher. now, Lily's not here, because someone called us from New York about parents' and John's grave. i decided to stay here, because i knew, i'd die there too. i was really depressed Frank. tried to kill myself for 3 times. well. Lily saved me every single time i tried this. i don't wanna do that anymore. i think im not suicidal anymore \" he stopped talking and looked away. his voice became sadder. huh. Lily meant everything to him. yeah. why not? but if she wasn't his wife? what if she wasn't and i was just an asshole? i decided to ask him. \"im.. im sorry to make you sadder teach, but.. you haven't said who''s Lily\" i told him. \"Lily? she's the only one left from my family, she's my sister Frank\" he said and suddenly i felt how i went red. all this time, i was thinking Lily was her wife and.. she was her sister, fucking sister. i was so stupid. \"Frank..\" he started. \"i told you my life wasn't interesting. i still haven't told you one thing\" \"which thing?\" i wondered. \"i can't tell you now. not now. please. don't make me do that, you'll forever hate me. okay. leave it here.\" \"but..\" i started. \"no, Frank, i said leave it here.\" it was his final word. if he said something, everyone had to do that. i did so. i didn't wanna make him angry. he'd never been angry with me. he had never shouted to me, never. and i was so happy. 'what are you thinking about?\" he asked.\" do you think im an asshole?\" \"what? no, no way teach, if you're an asshole, then i don't know what i am, i am maybe, an idiod, stupid, dorky kid.\" i stopped, but then added something.\"how my classmates use to call me\" \"shhh, \"Gerard said. \"i wanna correct one thing Frank. how they USED TO call you. \" he smiled. yeah. he was right. they used to. right. \"you know, Frank. i know you love playing on guitar\" he told me. \"yeah, i love\" i answered. he stood up and told me to wait one minute. i did so. when he went back he had a guitar in his hands. yeah. guitar. i wondered why did he take a guitar. \" i love playing on guitar too\" he said. wow. we had many things in common. 'can you..\" i started, i wanted him to play something for me. well. at least, to play something. not just for me. \"can you play something on it?\" i asked. \"for you?\" he added. \"yeah, for example, for me.\" i said. \"Frank.. i write songs.\" \"really?\" \"yeah. here's the one i wrote after i arrived here. i fished writing it yesterday.\" \"play it please.\" \"okay, it explains my life now. after my arrival from New York\" he uttered and took guitar to play. the name of the songs was \"you found me\" \"I found Guy\" he started. \"On the corner of First and Amistad Where the west Was all but won All alone Smoking his last cigarette I said, \"Where you been?\" He said, \"Ask anything\" \" he paused there. i liked it. he had such a good voice. so nice, beautiful. he was just so perfect. his hands were moving on guitar so slowly. he smiled and continued. \"Where were you When everything was falling apart? All my days Were spent by the telephone That never rang And all I needed was a call That never came To the corner of First and Amistad\" \" Lost and insecure You found me, you found me Lyin' on the floor Surrounded, surrounded Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you? Just a little late You found me, you found me\" it was a chorus. so beautiful song. \"in the end Everyone ends up alone Losing him The only one who's ever known Who I am Who I'm not, who I wanna be No way to know How long he will be next to me\" i was looking right at his eyes. so was he. we were staring into one another's. somehow i was all excited. i couldn't look away. he sang so consciously. about himself. and was dadicating to me. his singing of course. i didn't think so about lyrics. \"Lost and insecure You found me, you found me Lyin' on the floor Surrounded, surrounded Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you? Just a little late You found me, you found me\" The city breaks I've been callin' For years and years and years and years And you never left me no messages Ya never send me no letters You got some kinda nerve Taking all I want\" he frowned, narrowed his eyes. they were becoming wet somehow. the song seemed to be about someone who saved Gerard? \"Lost and insecure You found me, you found me Lyin' on the floor Where were you? Where were you? Lost and insecure You found me, you found me Lyin' on the floor Surrounded, surrounded Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you? Just a little late You found me, you found me Why'd you have to wait? To find me, to find me\" he finished. put the guitar on the table, still looking at my eyes, i was doing the same. somehow i was worried about him. my heart was warmed . i didn't know what i was doing. i just stood up and went closer to him. put my hand on his cheek and tried to kiss. as i tried to put my lips onto his, he stood up and went to the window. i looked away. i was feeling so strange. my heart was beating faster. i needed him that was just that i was so \"high\"? from my feelings that i got while Gerard was singing? yeah. i needed to search a new topic. didn't really wanna go from his house. but.. i thought, well.. i tried and asked him something., \"ugh... im sorry\" i uttered , somehow not so shy. i didn't feel that at all. \"it's okay. Frank.\" he said. still couldn't look at me. \"um.. so..\" i started. \"is this song about your love?' \"yeah\" \"no way to now how long HE will be next to me?\" i asked. \"what does this mean? is that a hopeless love?\" \"Frank..okay. i'll tell you. yeah. it is\" he said still looking from the window. \"my love is a mistake. yeah. and im trying to forget the one who i love but..\" he stopped and looked at me. \"i can't.\" finished. he couldn't? he was in love but his love was a mistake. what did it mean? also the \"he\" in that phrase. i've never been in love. everyone said it was great, excited. that you felt how your heart started beating faster with that \"someone\", how you couldn't breath, how you wanted die from his ,her cutiness. well. i've never felt this way but.. my results were scaring me, because yeah, i've felt like this. but not with a woman, (how it everything was supposed to be for me), with a man. yeah. with Gerard. but.. it wasn't love. HOLY FUCKING SHIT. nope it wasn't. there was no way i loved Gerard. you know what i mean. no. i just was a teenager and didn't know what i was doing and what i wanted to do. as my mom said, teenagers are confused and didn't really know what they are doing. they make thing at times, and then regret at others. yeah. the phone rang. i stood up to give it to Gerard. as i stood up he did same and came to take a phone and our hands touched. i took my hand as fast as possible away and went to the door. \"um..\" Gerard uttered. he was supposed to say \"hello\". \"i mean, hello\" he said. he was listening to someone speaking and then said. \"okay. he's here yet mrs Sarah.\" Sarah. my mother? oh. i remembered that i told her Gerard's number once. oh.. \"okay. i will let him go now. there's not dark yet, so i think he won't be afraid to walk alone, right?\" he asked me. afraid? what the fuck? why would i be afraid? \"no... of course\" i uttered. \"okay, okay. don't worry\" he said. he was done with the phone. \"Frank.. um\" he started. \"i can go alone.\" i uttered. i was angry, but at who? i felt i was angry but didn't know why, at who... maybe at myself. \"bye\" i said and left his house. \"Frank\" he called me when i was already outside. \"i think you understood right?\" he asked. \"yeah. but..\" well. i did. but i think i needed it again. \"but.. ? um.. Frank.. you can come here tomorrow too. that will be enough. you won't need anything after that\" he said. he was forcing himself. i could see. he was a teacher and had to do this he liked it or not. as i saw he forced himself. maybe because i was an asshole for trying to kiss him. for the second time. i was feeling strange at the moment, but i really wanted to go to Gerard's tomorrow too so.. i nooded once and went.[Chapter 12] that night was super fucking hard for me. first of all my mom asking me where i had been for so long, second, i had so many things to think of. i was really tired. all my life contained thinking about Gerard since he appeared in my life. i was sick. i tried to kiss the man for 2 times and he avoided me all the times. i really wasn't going to think about these because i knew i was going to make horrible conclusions. i didn't like where these everything was leading me. yeah i went to him the next day to. except of everything, i still wanted to see him and talk to him. we still continued talking about things in our lives. that day wasn't that special for me except of one thing. when i was going home it was dark. well. we saw that an accident happened that night to a woman and she got killed. i was afraid of walking alone at home. i still couldn't tell him because i knew he was gonna think i was a coward, i wasn't. when i was going out of his house he himself asked me if i wanted him to come with me. of course i told him no but i think he guessed that i was afraid. what a man. he could read everything i was thinking and i discovered super fucking amazing thing there. he had fucking bike. \"do you wanna ride a bike?\" he asked. \"oh no, i don't know how to do that\" i told him. it was such a good bike. well. i wasn't that good in guessing which firm bikes were, but it was cool. \"Frank. aren't you lazy about walking?\" \"i am but.. i don't know how to ride a bike\" \"but i know\" he uttered and told me that he could ride it with me. well. i wanted to. i wasn't afraid of anything next to him. when he sat on it, told me to sit behind him. \"put your hands on my body Frank\" he said. \"so that you aren't gonna fall off the bike\" he laughed and waited for me. i was a little bit afraid and twisted his shirt by holding it with my hands. \"Frank\" he uttered. \"what?\" i answered. \"how am i able to drive if you touch me like that? your hands put on my shirt like that disturbes me.\" \"what should i do then?\" i asked. \"put your hands under my shirt\" he said. oh. i was going to touch his body. his .body. i put my right hand on his body. it was so warm. i did same with my left hand. \"that's better\" he said. at first he moaned. \"what?\" i asked. \"nothing. your hands are so cold.\" \"okay. your body is warm and my hands will become warm too\" i smiled and hugged him on his back. i was so comfortable sitting behind him , touching his body and feeling him. he wasn't riding very fast. well. i was less frightened. but this was better than walking alone. i was with Gerard also. i didn't know why but i felt very comfortable when i was next to him. at one moment when he was turning aside i was scared that i was gonna fall off the bike and i hugged him very tightly. i saw how he smiled. \"are you afraid baby?\"he asked. ugh. that \"baby\". Gerard was killing me. \"im not\" i uttered and i saw how he smiled again. he was so handsome while riding a bike. i really liked his style. he always had black shirt on, black trousers and black belt. also he loved putting leather jacket. i adored him. he was an idol for me. that was nearly the best moment in my life. well. i understood that issue more that day, i thought i didn't need to prepare anymore, i wanted to, but not for studying. i wanted to be with Gerard. i was funny right? well. another cool shit happened that week. when it was Sunday, mom decided to go to her friend who wasn't here for like several days, she had something to do out of town. she told me that her friend also wanted to see me, mom was talking too much about me with her friends and she wanted to see me and told mom to come to her's with me. she was working on my appearance for like one hour. i didn't need anything tho. i just brushed my hair and put my jeans and shirt but she complained that i was dressed like shit and made me put something else on. as i already said she dressed me and worked on my appearance for one hour. if not more. when we were done, i asked her where did she live and she didn't tell me the exact place. maybe thought that i was gonna see it anyway when we were gonna go to her house. she had to be Gerard's neighbour, cause from what my mom explained she lived near Gerard. when we were on the road i asked my mom: \"mom, how long are you friends with her?\" \"oh baby. for so long now. i know she has a brother. i wonder who he is. he wasn't living here. just arrived. it's been 3 or 4 months now since he's here.\" she said. \"really? mom. have i seen that friend?\" \"no, honey. \" \"what's her name?\" i asked. \"Frankie.. it's.. Lily\" holy shit. what the fuck? everything was so confusing. Lily? brother who has just arrived for 3-4 months. ugh. were we going to Gerard's? \"mom?\" i was so excited. \"yeah\" \"are we going to Gerard's?\" i asked immediately. \"Gerard's? what? Frankie?\" \"yeah, mom, his sister's name is Lily.\" \"oh, there's her house.\"she uttered and pointed me to the house where Gerard lived. what the fuck! mom! \" . that's exactly where Gerard lives.\" i muttered and refused to go there. Gerard wasn't at school that day. that's the reason. her sister arrived. mom told me that they'd been friends for 5 years then. strong friendship. wow. i didn't wanna go there. but mom. my mom. if she said something, i had to do that. there was no way she was letting me do what i wanted. especially when she didn't like what i was gonna do. i had to go with her. Gerard wouldn't have any idea we were going there. mom told me that he and Lily both knew, but he knew that \"someone\" was going to visit them, not that i was that visitor. we went into yard. mom knocked on the door. \"mom. please. let me go\" i uttered. \"Frank. how are you behaving? what's up with you? stay here i said.\" she said and the door opened. a blond, thin girl was standing inside the door. \"oh.\" he said and hugged my mom.\"Sarah. i missed you dear, come on, is this your boy? he is so lovely\" she said and pulled my cheek. \"what happened Lily?\" Gerard asked from another room. \"my guests came Gee\" she uttered. so, Gee was the name his family members were calling him. \"okay. i will be there in 5 minutes\" he stated. \"oh, i missed you Lily\" mom said and they hugged each-other again. i rolled my eyes, they were so sentimental. maybe i thought like this cause i didn't have any friend? who knew, maybe. they started asking each-other how they had been since Lily left New Jersey. come on mom. it's only been like several days since she left. ugh. i was already tired. \"i'm here\" Gerard said and went in the room we were in. \"oh\" he uttered and first looked at my mom and then at me. \"Frank? Mrs Sarah?\" he asked. \"Gerard. let me introduce you my best friend Sarah and her lovely little boy Frank\" she started \"but.. you already know them? \"yeah\" Gerard said, he seemed confused. \"Frank's my student. i teach him maths.\" \"really? so you and Lily already know each-other?\" \"we are not that close. i didn't know she was that friend who you were talking this much about\" he laughed and sat next to me. \"welcome to my house.\" he said \"now that you know who my best friend is Gerard, please, don't behave stangely to Sarah and vice versa okay?\" she said and hugged mom again. they seemed to be very good friends, seemed to love each-other very much. \"okay\" Gerard said. mom and Lily started talking about many things, there wasn't anything left they didn't talk about. i rolled my eyes again. Gerard looked at me and laughed. \"do you want coffee?\" Lily asked. \"yeah\"mom said. \"does this little boy want?\" she asked again. \"no, no, he has heart problems and..\"mom started. \"oh, come on.\" Gerard said. \"do you want Frank? \"yeah but..\" i uttered. \"huh, okay, there's not a problem in drinking coffee for only one time. okay Mrs Sarah?\" he smiled. \"okay but there's one problem Mr Gerard\" mom uttered. \"you are not calling me Mrs, okay?\" she asked and laughed. \"okay, but only in that case if you don't call me Mr\" \"okay\" mom finished and Gerard stood up. \"i will prepare coffee Lily, you sit here. 4 cups right?\" he asked and went to the kitchen. \"Frank\" Lily started talking to me. \"why don't you say anything?\" \"oh.. well..\" i started \"well?\" \"i don't have anything to say?\" i uttered. \"Gerard, come to the little boy you bastard. he has nothing to say to women, aren't you a man?\" \"oh Lily.. im making something.. do you have an amnesia?\" \"right. come quickly.\" she said and then turned to me \"Frank, you are so quiet, are you a quiet boy? \"um.. yeah, kinda\" i said. \"yeah\" Gerard yelled from the kitchen. \"he's a quiet boy at school too\" \"is Gerard a good teacher?\" Lily whispered and laughed. \"Lily, im not deaf yet\" Gerard screamed. it was so funny. they were cool brother and sister. in five minutes Gerard came in and gave us our coffee cups. i loved drinking coffee but mom wasn't giving it to me. \"do you like it Frank?\" Gerard asked me. \"Gerard, you haven't asked it to me\" Lily uttered and laughed. \"i don't care\" Gerard laughed back. i liked being there. i smiled about this. \"what are you laughing at?\" Gerard asked. \"nothing\" i said and smiled again. \"okay\" \"Frank\" Lily started talking. \"i already love you so much. me and your mom have been friends for 5 years now. yeah. i was living here five years ago, then i heard about my parents' illness and went there, with Gerard and my brother John. after so many years, they died and me and Gerard decided to arrive here. me and your mom were still in touch while i wasn't here. you see how strong our friendship is right?\" \"yeah, of course, i know these from Gerard already\" \"really? okay then\" she smiled. we were there for like 3 hours. mom and Lily were still talking about stuff. i was bored. i looked at Gerard, so seemed he. he looked back at me, i tried to look away and not to show him i was staring at him. he looked away too then. \"Frank.. if you're bored, you ccn do watever you want okay?\" Lily said. \"okay\" i uttered. she was looking at me for some minutes. i wondered what she wanted, then asked. \"Sarah, he's so quiet, is he in love?\" ugh. no, i wasn't. \"i don't know\" mom smiled. \"he's being so confused lately. isn't with me, is flying somewhere else. also has become happier. i don't know, maybe he is?\" mom asked both, Lily and her looked at me with smiling. i felt how Gerard looked at me too. \"you're in love little boy, can't we just know who she is?\" Lily asked. i didn't know why but i looked at Gerard. he was looking at me already. he wasn't smiling. i wasn't either, \"Frank?\" mom asked. \"no, im not in love\" i said while looking at Gerard. he looked away as i said these words. i was looking at him for some seconds and then looked away. \"why are you looking at Gerard?\" Lily narrowed her eyes while smiling. \"does Gerard know? huh? Gerard?\" \"me?\" Gerard uttered. \"yeah, you, tell us quickly, Gerard, come on\" she started asking him. 'i don't know. how should i know? he hasn't told m..\" \"no, im pretty sure he has\" Lily didn't let Gerard finish his sentence. \"i don't know Lily\" Gerard said. \"no, he doesn't know, really\" i said, \"that means that there is someone\" mom laughed. \"no mom , there isn't and i don't wanna talk about it please\" i said and stood up. \"okay, where are you going?\" mom asked. \"i will go out to balcony.\" \"are you feeling bad?\" mom got nervous. \"no mom. i just wanna go out for a little time.\" i said and went to the balcony. it was a dark night. i facilitated as i went out on the open air. i was there, standing for some minutes and looking to the nature. the moon was so beautiful. it was the only thing shining everything. suddenly i felt how something moved behind me. i looked around and i saw Gerard. he came to me and stood next to me. he was starting smoking. \"it's beautiful, isn't it?\" he asked. \"yeah\" i uttered. \"i love looking at night and drawing it\" he started. \"drawing a night is very fantastic. it looks more beautiful on the picture than what it actually is. \"have you ever drown a night?\" i asked. \"yeah, i have, for many times. i love drawing night\" \"i bet your picture is fantastic\" \"aww Frank.\"he uttered and looked at me. \"i didn't know you were smoking.\" i told him. \"well. yeah. i smoke. i smoke from like the age of 16..\" \"it's as same as, if i started smoking now\" i said. \"no, you shouldn't Frank, it's a very bad thing\" \"why are you smoking then?\" i asked. \"cause once you smoke it, then you will never be able to get rid of it.\" he said and dropped the cigarette from the balcony. \" i think smoke was disturbing you right?\" \"no, no, why did you throw it away, you could smoke if you wanted, it wasn't disturbing me at all.\" i told him immadietly. \"okay. i threw it already\" he finished and looked at the nature. \"imagine how fantastic being here with your lover would be\" i said and looked at the moon. \"yeah,\"Gerard said and looked down.\" like, look at the moon, the stars, they are shining so brightly. everything is so fantastic\" \"yeah\" i said. i kept quiet for a while but then i felt something in my heart. yeah. i shouldn't have drank coffee. didn't my mother warn me? \"ugh\" i muttered and put my hand on my chest. \"Frank?\" Gerard got nervous and looked at me to see what was up. \"im alright\" i said. i felt some pain, i was feeling it back then too when i told him i was okay, but i tried not to care. \"i will call someone\"he said. \"no\" i told him and put my hand on his to stop him. \"stay here please, don't leave me\" i said. i started breathing hard. \"Frank but.. okay. keep breathing hard. oh. does it hurt you very much?\" \"well. \" i couldn't speak for some seconds. \"i will stay on open air for some minutes and i think it will help\" i uttered. he put his hand on my chest. sighed. \"poop baby\" he uttered and put his right hand on my cheek. i looked up at him. my heart was stopping hurting slowly. especially since Gerard put his hand on it. we were close again. \"does it hurt?\" Gerard asked. \"i think.. well... i think it's stopping\" i uttered and felt how he moved his head nearer. our noses touched. i didn't care that mom and Lily were there. this time it was going to happen. we were standing, in front of the beautiful nature, night, under the moon and trying to kiss each-other. i was excited. i felt his breathing. his lip went slimy again. everytime i looked at them they were slimy. Gerard looked at my lips. i looked at his eyes, his hazel eyes, they were driving me crazy. i put my forehead on his. he was taller than me and was looking down at my eyes. he was still touching me with his right hand. he touched his left one on my body and pulled me closer so that out bodies were touching. i felt how his stomach was moving from breathing. i put my hand on his, which he was touching my cheek with. we were touching our noses, bodies. i was feeling him. he was standing there,right in front of me. i saw how he moved his tongue to lick his lips. we both had our mouths opened. i felt how his breathing was going into my mouth. this time, i was going to kiss him and nothing on Earth was able to stop me, not even Gerard. i moved my head nearer and nearer and finally. it happened. i closed my eyes. he put his lips on mine. at first i didn't know what i was doing. i had pressed my lips on his. i was fucking touching his lips with mine. i wasn't going to only press my lips, as soon as i thought this, he opened his mouth and started moving it slowly. i've never thought about kissing a man. i've never done that either. i was thanking god for that but now, i was thanking him for kissing Gerard. it was incredible. his mouth was so warm and wet. i moved mine too and starting kissing him passionately. his lips were incredibly delicious. i couldn't have ever imagined he knew such a good kiss. he put his right hand too on my body and pulled me even closer. i didn't know where to put my hands and decided to put them around him to feel him more and more. i felt how his slimy tongue was moving in my mouth and vice versa. i wasn't even tired of kissing him, i could kiss him all day. i wasn't regretting anything either. that was the best moment in my life. his lips were so soft,we both were moving our heads and lips. at one moment, i thought i was in heaven and not on Earth and that there was nothing that was going to stop us but then my mother's call put everything out. i was on Earth again, standing on the balcony. as we heard the call, we both opened our eyes and pulled each-other away. \"ugh\" i uttered. i just got what i did. i fucking kissed him. finally i did it. \"um.. yeah\" i uttered and looked away. Gerard wasn't looking at me. he was looking somewhere else. interested in why mom had called me. maybe she saw it? no. there was no way she did. \"Frankie baby, what are you doing there for so long?\" she asked. it made everything easier. she hadn't seen us. \"im coming mom\" i uttered and tried to get away from there as fast as i could. i was very nervous. what had i just done? \"im here\" i said and i went in a room. i sat on the sofa again. i was touching Gerard, i was kissing a man just a minute ago. i couldn't look at Gerard in his eyes. the only thing i wanted to do right then, was going home and laying on my bed, thinking. \"i'll be in my room.\" i heard familiar voice. it was Gerard, he came in and went upstairs. \"wait Gerard\" Lily yelled. there wasn't any response. Gerard was already on the second floor. \"what happened?\" she asked. \"um.. nothing\" i muttered and looked down. well. this time, i didn't start anything. didn't Gerard started kissing me? yeah. he was the one who opened mouth and pressed his lips with mine. i've wanted to kiss him for a long time then and i couldn't let myself not to kiss him that time. i wanted it too, but i didn't start it. he did. oh. my life was so odd. i needed to get away from there. i was biting my lips, i was still feeling his lips' taste. we were there for an hour since that moment when Lily told me to go to Gerard's room. there was no way i was going there. nope. but my mom looked at me like a beast when i rejected. she'd always told me not to reject if someone asked me something, especially if she, he was stranger. well, Lily was still stranger to me, i''d only met her for 1 time. i stood up and asked what she wanted. she wanted Gerard's phone. she told me where his room was and told me that i could go. i felt how something dropped in my stomach. seeing Gerard after what we did, felt like going to hell. Gerard's room was identified to hell that moment. when i went upstairs, i searched for his room. it was there. i was so fucking confused. i forgot to even knock on it and opened the door. \"hey, Lily, don't come in, im naked\" Gerard yelled and shut the door, holy fucking shit. Gerard was naked. i was such an asshole. how did i forget to knock on the door? \"um.. it's me\" i uttered. \"Frank?\" he asked and i felt how his voice went trembling. \"yeah\" i was so ashamed. \"im sorry, Lily needs your.. um.. y'know? phone\" i said finally. \"okay\" he said and from what i heard from the door, he started searching for it. i was waiting there, still ashamed and couldn't even look at the door. Gerard didn't tell anything either for a long time. then, after some minutes, he opened the door and gave me his phone. \"im sorry\" i uttered and tried to get away from there. i wanted to go away from that house as fast as i could. i started lying that i wasn't feeling good and made my mom leave that house. i didn't wanna be there. what i did was horrible. how was i going to meet Gerard next day? how was i going to look at his eyes? when just a day later he was kissing me? well. i'm not gonna lie, he knew such a great kiss. i thought i was flying in clouds during his kissing, i thought i wasn't on this planet. that's exactly what others call being in love. but could i fall in love with man when i wasn't gay? i was pretty sure i wasn't but facts were proving me opposite things. well. after kiss, i did even more horrible thing. i should have knocked on the door. i was an asshole. but the fact that only one door was disturbing me from seeing naked Gerard made me tremble. oh. i was thinking such bad things last times. i didn't like where this, everything was leading me. the only thing that mattered to me was school. Gerard didn't come down that day. he was in his bedroom all day. Lily called then my mom and they were talking for half an hour. didn't they talk about everything they wondered and wanted to share there, at Gerard's house? ugh. these women. yeah. and Lily told mom that Gerard didn't even eat anything. i was so worried. i made him like this. but it was only that day. i hoped he wasn't going to behave like this forever. i wondered what was going to happen next. was he going not to talk to me? or was he going to avoid me? or what? i didn't have any clue at what was coming next. i was so confused. yeah and on the other hand i wanted to see him, but seeing him was the last thing i wanted to do in my life right then at the same time. i know i was fucking asshole and idiot. i couldn't even sleep that night waiting for the next day. i didn't wanted to come the next day, i didn't wanted to wake up in the morning. i wanted to sleep and never wake up.[Chapter 13] the next day, i woke up, i was sad that i opened my eyes. i didn't wanna open them. i wanted to die. if i opened my eyes, i knew that i had to go to school. at school i was going to meet Gerard. how was i going to look at his eyes? i had kissed him, fucking did it. i had kissed a man. i've never thought doing it before. i was supposed to kiss girls because i was a boy, but no, instead i kissed a boy and well, it'd be less horrible if that boy was just a friend to me, he was fucking teacher. but, he wasn't supposed to do it either. he should've been more responsible because he was a teacher, i was a student, still illegal and didn't know what i was doing, but he wouldn't have kissed me if i hadn't let him to. i let him this, i let him kiss me. that's why it all happened. at that moment, i was the happiest person in the world but then? how was i going to talk to him again? i had to go to school. i had to look at him cause he was a teacher and i needed to pass my exams, on the other hand the last thing i wanted to happen was Gerard leaving my class. see what kind of situation was i in? see why i wanted to sleep and never wake up? thanks god first lesson wasn't maths. second. it was second. when the bell rang for the second lesson, my heart started beating so fast that i thought it was going to come out from it's own place. when Gerard came in, it started beating even faster. we all stood up. he looked at class. i wasn't even looking at him. i was watching at the walls. interesting job right? i was looking down all lesson. my heart started panicing when Gerard read my name out of the list, wondering if i was absent or present. i was flying somewhere, wasn't thinking about the lesson when he asked \"isn't Frank at the lesson?\" and looked at us. \"ugh.. im\" i muttered.. \"im here\" said quietly. he didn't say anything and continued reading students' names out. i looked down again, not knowing what to do. it made me a little sad that he didn't reply anything but it wasn't surprising cause how was he supposed to behave since that moment? it's not that i was regretting anything. i wasn't. i was just worried about Gerard, i thought that i'd lost him for what we'd done. i was guessing that he didn't just mean a best friend to me, but what was he for me? i didn't know. i was lost. i didn't wanna think either, cause it was leading me to a horrible fact and i didn't like it. i layed my head on the desk and didn't look at him again. he wasn't on his mood either. he used to explain a lesson studiously. but that time, i guessed that, all he wanted was finishing the lesson and going out of my class. doctor told me that i had to try not to care about stuff and not to worry. i was trying but you could very well see that i was failing so bad. i had my pills with me all the time. i had to take them once a day. when the bell was rang Gerard left the room. he didn't even say goodbye or something like that. no. he just left. i heard some whispering about him telling that he was on a bad mood. yeah. it wasn't only me. everyone could see that he wasn't feeling like himself that day. i was sitting when i noticed that he had left this phone. he was hurrying up and he'd left his phone here. that was okay. i wasn't going to give it to him anyway. i took my bag and searched for my pills to take, i was feeling really bad with my heart and decided to take them right then. as i took one pill and put other in my bag, someone kicked my back. i looked behind me. yeah. who would it be if not James. \"ahahahahha\" he laughed \"you taking pills poor little baby? hahahah boy is sick\" he screamed and laughed again. i was really angry and tried not to care about him. long time went since he last bullied me. i tried to take the pill back but he got angry that i didn't care about what he was doing and took it away. \"give me\" i yelled and tried to take my pills back. he put his hand which he had a pill in up, since he was taller than me, i couldn't reach it. \"give me\" i yelled even louder and continued trying to get my pill back. my heart was hurting and i needed to take it. if not, maybe my heart was going to hurt me more and more. even thinking about it was terrible. \"i won't give it to you\" he screamed and laughed again. everyone were looking at us and laughing. i felt really angry. i needed that pill, i needed it very much. i tried to jump and reach for the pill which was in his hand, but he moved his hand even higher. that was why i hated myself. i was the smallest in my class. i was fucking useless. my heart started aching. it was slowly starting to hurt more and more. i put my hand on it. \"hahaha, heart hurts\" he uttered ironically. \"James please\" i said. \"oh that's better. now. come on. ask me. ask me to give it to you.\" \"give me please\" i uttered. \"okay\" he said and extended the pill to take. i was surprised. he usually used to be very mean. at first i thought he was lying but then i saw that he was still offering me to take it. i moved my hand to take a pill. still not sure what was he thinking and was going to do. i tried to take it but he was holding it too tightly. i pulled it. he wasn't letting the pills go of his hand. i pulled it more and more and more and then he let the pill go of his hand and i found myself falling on the ground . fucking bastard! i knew he had thought something bad. but still. my neck hurt, hands, leg, everything hurt. they started laughing, the pill was still in James' hands. i was really upset, but couldn't do anything. on the other hand, my heart was hurting. i didn't know what to do. James bent down to look at me, i didn't know what he was going to do because i closed my eyes. at that moment i really thought it was the end for me but again. that saviour appeared again. my saviour. he saved me again. Gerard went in class. he came in to take his phone he'd left there. \"hey, what's up here?\" he asked and looked around. i had still closed my eyes. \"Frank?\" he asked and ran to me. everyone tried to go but Gerard yelled to everyone not to go. everything was hurting. i couldn't even open my eyes. i needed that pill. \"what happened? who did this to him?\" he yelled and i heard Gerard's angry voice like this, for the first time. \"who? tell me!\" he screamed even louder. everyone were quiet. \"pill\" i uttered. \"what, which pill?\" Gerard asked. as he asked this James gave him a pill. i took it quickly and drank it. \"Frank, what happened?\" Gerard asked and bent down to see what hurt to me. \"nothing\" i uttered. he stood up and looked at James. \"what did you do to him\" he yelled. \"nothing\" James said ,\" i just, was trying to.. well...\" \"how many times do i have to tell you not to bully him? Gerard asked. \"he's sick. i bet you weren't giving him his pills. aren't i right? aren't i?\" he screamed and looked at everyone. they looked frightened. i felt a little better and tried to stand up. \"are you okay?\" Gerard asked. \"yeah, i guess\" i said. i wasn't caring about the fact that we'd kissed. the only thing that mattered to me that moment was fucking James and his lies. \"do you know what'd happen if something happened to him? do you know that he is the only son to her mother? do you know what he's gone through? seems you don't.\" he was continuing screaming to them. my back was still hurting from falling on the ground. heart was stopping slowly. that pill helped me. \"i will hear again about bullying him and i swear, i will punish you all, whole class\" he uttered, pointed me to go with him. i didn't move. when he was at the door James yelled. \"yeah. okay let's see who's better. i fucking hate you, why you always defend Frank?\" i was amazed. what did he just say? nobody dared saying to Gerard thing like this. how did he dare? the he added something aloud. \"when i was late you punished me, you didn't punish Frank. why not? why do you always defend him and not others? why you always with him? why? \" he was yelling. everyone were surprised. he dared a lot. i whidened my eyes and looked at Gerard. he was still looking at the door, with his back to us. but James didn't think it was enough. he continued again. \"i hate you. you are the worst teacher here. but. i guess why you defend Frank..\" he coughed. what was he going to say? i was looking at Gerard, then at James, then at Gerard again. not knowing what was going to happen. \"i know why. because you're,\" he coughed again.\" you're a fag\" he screamed aloud. holy fucking shit! he was fucking bastard. everyone sighed from the excitement. they had their excited faces \"on\", i was fucking surprised. i really wanted to beat him for this. how did he call Gerard a fag? how did he dare? i looked at others. well. if you asked me, nobody laughed. everyone had serious faces, nobody believed James either. i could very well see. nobody believed him. that was impossible. he was such a good man. my heart was telling me that there was going to happen something big and terrible. James dared a lot. Gerard was still looking at the door and turned around when he heard those words. i was ready to fucking kill him. Gerard went pale. i saw that he became very angry. i saw Gerard like this for the first time. well. he went to James. stood right in front of him, looking right at his eyes and then all of a sudden he did something that made me even more surprised. as Gerard went to him, he did an incredible thing. he hit James. wow. my eyes went whidened. the teacher hit the student. that was the first time when thing like this happened at my school. at least while i was studying there. James fell down. Gerard had such a strength in his arms. he made James fall down with only one hit. he seemed to be so angry. James couldn't do anything. he was just laying on the floor and bleeding. yeah. blood was coming from his nose. i was shocked. what did just happen, i couldn't believe my eyes. no. i thought i was in a dream. how could this happen? how did James dare this? how did Gerard hit him? he usually was so kind, caring and good to students but ugh. this time everything was different. he was fucking angry. imagine how much anger James caused in Gerard to make him hit him? a girl came from the crowd and went to call someone for help. Gerard was standing there for some minutes, looking at James bleeding. he was screaming for help. seemed his nose was hurting so much. Gerard left without a word. i felt so sorry for him. i didn't care what was going to happen to James. he was a bitch and got what he deserved. but.. there was one thing. it was illegal to hit a student in our school. teachers were getting punished and sometimes... sometimes.. getting fired? holy shit. no. it wasn't going to happen. i left the classroom to search for Gerard. i needed to see him and hear from him that he wasn't going to go from our school. no. even thinking about it was making me sick. i couldn't find him anywhere. he wouldn't have gone from school, i knew he wasn't a coward. a lavatory! yeah. he was gonna be there. i was sure. i went to the lavatory. i heard how someone moaned from our classroom. it was probably a teacher when he saw James' nose. i was finally there. i got nervous. i didn't know what i was going to see there. my heart was telling me that Gerard was there, but.. i was afraid of his reaction. i was afraid of what i was going to see there. i went in. he was in teacher's lavatory. i didn't care if someone was going to see me there. i wanted to see Gerard. i heard someone sobbing. yeah. fucking sobbing. i thought someone else was there but all i saw was Gerard, standing at sink and looking in the mirror. i couldn't believe. was Gerard sobbing? it was fucking impossible, but.. every human cries. \"Frank?\" he said and tried to hide his tears. dried them, turned around and looked at me. he might've seen me from the mirror. \"what are you doing here? he asked. \"i'm.. well.. teach.. i was just \" i couldn't finish and moved to him closer. he looked away. \"go, please\" he started \" i don't want you to see me like this, im just..\" \"you were crying ?\" i asked. \"what\" he asked \"nope, of course, i wasn't crying. that's false\" he tried to look surprised but i could very well see that it was fake. \"teach. but..\" i started and touched his cheek to dry tears. yeah. he was crying. his cheeks were wet. \"Frank, please\" he started. \"stop. i think.. i think im gonna go from school\" he added and tried to move but.. i wasn't letting him go. that was life without him would be nothing. \"what?\" i asked from excitement. \"yeah, after what i did, i can't stay here.\" he said. \"no, please. im not letting you go\" i nearly yelled. \"Frank, calm down\" he uttered and looked away. \"look at my eyes\" i told him. he was looking away. not looking at my eyes. \"look at me\" i said louder. \"what do you want?\" he asked. he had got nervous. i felt so bad for him. it wasn't his fault. everything was James' fault. ugh. i hated James so much. \"stay. you're not going anywhere. you saved me for many times. teach. you saved me now too. what are you doing? leaving me for these stupid kids? leaving my class for fucking James?\" i was yelling . yeah. i found myself yelling at him. \"partly James, Frank. please stop asking me questions\" he uttered. he was becoming angry too. \"no. teach. im not letting you go. you saved me for many times. imagine, if you go, they will start bullying me again. please. stay. we can replace James, he can sit in another class, i swear, but..\" i couldn't finish my sentence. \"Frank stop! i said im going. i don't wanna be here\" \"you don't wanna be here? what about me?\" \"Frank, you were a student of me. i've left many classes\" \"shut up.\" i yelled. he looked at me surprised. \"am i just a student to you?\" i asked. \"no, i didn't..\" \"what did you say then? stay please\" i said. \"Frank. leave me alone. why do you want me to be your teacher? im am idiot. i hit a student.\" \"he deserved it. he really did. how could he call \"gay\" to you?\" \"that's why im leaving your class\" \"what? for him calling you gay? i swear nobody believed him teach, i \" he stopped me again. \"no, Frank. im not leaving your class for him calling me gay. i just.. yeah. okay. you didn't get it. im not gonna explain\" he uttered and told me to go. \" i won't go. what about us then? what about us? i will never see you. don't you wanna see me everyday as much as i wanna see you and need you?\" i was yelling. i hated the fact that he was going from our school. i still didn't get why he left, he told me it was about hitting me, thenn told me it wasn't about hitting and it was about him calling gay but then denied it and told me that i didn't get it. how could i? how the fuck could i get what he'd told me? \"Frank\" he started. \"the main reason of me leaving your class in you\" he said. what the fuck? \"what?\" i uttered. very surprised about that answer. \"yeah. okay. stop now.\" \"teach, you are the best thing i've got in my life. you became my best friend. i love you more than a teacher. i consider you as my best friend\" \"Frank\" he started. \"i am the best thing you've got? i'd say that you're probably the worst\" he said and oh my fucking god. what did he tell me? my eyes went whidened. i was the worst thing? yeah i got everything. i didn't mean anything to him. that's why he was leaving our class as nothing and ugh.. i meant nothing to him. my eyes watered. his face went worried. maybe he got what he'd just said. \"Frank.. wait. i didn't mean it\" he uttered and tried to come to me but i moved and ran away. \"Frank, wait, i didn't mean it like this\" i heard his yelling, i was already out of the lavatory. i wasn't going to stay there. what did he tell me. i meant nothing? fucking nothing. i thought i was his best friend and that he loved me but.. see? he didn't even consider me as his best friend i guess. that was the worst moment in my life. i really wanted to die. i was running. but didn't know where i was going. i wanted to be somewhere else. i wasn't staying at lessons. i just wanted to forget everything that happened in my life after Gerard arrived. i was fucking disctucted. he was killing me. he killed my heart with those words. so what did his kiss mean? what did his words mean? why did he save me for many times? why was he so caring to me? why did he get close to me? i was so confused. i hated everything. everything reminded me of him at school. i ran out of the school yard. someone saw me but i didn't care, i was running and not going to go back. everyday, i was going to school because i knew i was going to see Gerard. now? what was going to happen? he wasn't going to come in class. wasn't going to teach us, explain things to me. he maybe was going to go back to New York. i was crying. yes crying. tears were coming of my eyes, i was crying really hard. my life was awful. someone appeared who seemed to care of me, and now i was letting him go, he was leaving me. but how exactly did i know he cared of me? yeah. i saw it from his behaviour but.. what did he say to me? didn't he say i was the worst thing in his life? yeah, he added that he didn't mean it like that but fucking false. he added it cause he saw how my eyes were watering and how i got hurt. the only thing i wanted right then, was forgetting Gerard appearance in my life. his leaving was more hurtful than my life before him. i was losing Gerard. i was losing the man who saved me for many times. i was fucking losing him. how did he let go of me? didn't i mean at least \"something\" to him? that weak was so hard for me. Gerard was officially leaving our class. the only thing i wanted right then was to beat James and kill him. seriuously. it was the first time i wanted to kill someone. i wasn't even joking. i really wanted. i heard that Gerard wasn't going to school. they already had another teacher. i heard. yeah. i heard. i wasn't going to school too. i was lying to mom that i was going there but no. i hadn't gone to school since Gerard left. i also heard that Gerard wasn't fired officially. he wasn't going to school but he hadn't left yet. the director wasn't here for 1 weak, Gerard had to wait for director's arrival to leave school officially. i didn't care about anything. he wasn't going to school. that meant that he was really gonna leave it. when director was going to arrive, Gerard was going to sigh some stuff and.. and.. i couldn't finish it. my life became awful. i was on a bad mood everyday. mom was worried. she asked me many times what was up but i lied to her every time. every. single. time. they could only make me go to school if they killed me. i fucking hated everything. i was wandering the whole day. didn't care of what teachers were saying about me. didn't care about my marks either. without Gerard, school was nothing, fucking empty. every single part reminded me of him. i just couldn't go there, i would cry, i knew. i was gonna cry. i missed him so much. seemed he didn't love me as much as i loved him. i loved him but you know what i mean. he was my friend, who saved me many times. wouldn't you be worried and sad if your best friend left you? wouldn't you be worried if the one who saved your life, the only friend you had, left you? you would. that was what kind of situation was i in. i missed him so much. i missed his hazel eyes. his voice. explaining to me the lesson and speaking to me every day. how much i wanted to see him. i hadn't gone to school that day either. the fifth day after his leaving. after two days, just two days were left till director's arrival. after 2 days he was going to officially leave school. ugh. was he thinking of me like i was thinking of him? i bet no. but i needed to see him anyway. i didn't care if he even remembered me. i didn't even care that he said i was the worst thing. i didn't care about anything. i needed to see him. tears were coming from my eyes. i was crying really hard. my eyes were red. it wasn't late yet. i could make him stay here. but if he didn't appear for 5 days and nothing made him come to school for 5 days, how was i going to make him do this with my only one visit? but i really needed to see him. i didn't care about Lily. i decided to go to his house. when i went in, tears went from my eyes even harder. his fucking house. i was going to see him. i didn't even knock on the door and went like that. \"oh. Frank?\" Lily was surprised that i did so. \"where's teacher Gerard?\" i asked. not even saying hello or something like that. \"in his room, but what happened Frank?\" she asked but i didn't care of it. i was already going upstairs. \"wait Frank\" Lily yelled. i didn't care of that either. i knew where Gerard's room was. i wanted to see him so bad. i didn't knock on the doorr too and went in like that. \"he's just come from bath\" i heard Lily yelling just as i went in. \"hey!\" Gerard uttered and looked at the door to see who was standing there. \"Frank?\" he asked. i saw how he got confused and worried at the same time. i heard someone going downstairs. that had to be Lily, who'd seen that i was already in Gerard's room. he was standing there. he only had a towel on. his body was already dried. his hair was wet. ugh. how hot he looked like that. how beautiful his body. was. \"what are you doing?\" he asked. still not knowing what was up with me for doing this. \"teacher\" i cried and came closer to him. \"Frank\" he looked down. he got why i was there. maybe he knew it before too , he just didn't know what to ask. \"come back to school please\" i said. i was going to start crying. yeah. right in front of him. i wasn't even going to ask him how he was. what he was during this time. i wanted to see him everyday so bad. i'd die if he went from school. \"Frank please, stop\" he uttered. he looked worried and sad. i bet he didn't like his idea too. he knew that i was going to start crying there. he looked so worried. i couldn't not look at him. i needed to see him so much. \"i need you\" i uttered. \"Frank.. me leaving school doesn't mean you have to stop going to school\" he stated. \"no. i won't go to school. i swear i will kill myself\" i said. \"look at my eyes\" nearly yelled. \"they are red\" said Gerard. it took a while for him to look at my eyes and say that. \"Frank.. my heart hurts when i see you like this\" he said with the face expression that was telling me that he needed me too. \"i had been crying for these days teacher. i had been crying every day.\" i cried. \"Frank..\" he looked really sad. couldn't look at my eyes anymore. \"please. if you don't stop crying, i will die. don't make me see you like this\" he uttered . \"uh huh? do i mean something now? i was the worst thing just 5 days ago.\" \"don't remind me of that. Frank. i need to. please.\" \"no, please\" i couldn't take that anymore. \"don't leave me please. i will die. you saved me for many times. you mean everything to me. don't leave me please\" i started crying. yeah. 2 tears went from my eyes. that was enough for him to get nervous and even more worried. \"no please\" his eyes started watering. \"don't cry please.\" he put his hand on my cheek to wipe my tears. \"don't cry. i die every single time when tears come from your eyes. don't cry. we gotta learn leaving alone and letting things go\" \"no. im not gonna let you go. i wonder, aren't you even a little sad for leaving me? don't you miss me?\" \"Frank.. i have to. you will have many best friends after me in your life.\" \"no, i want none of them. you're not only best friend. i feel special when i am next to you. i believe that im not useless. what are you doing to me?\" i complained and looked at his eyes persistently. he was trying so hard not to look at me. \"Frank. time cures everything. after some weeks , you won't even remember me. i swear. you won't even remember i was someone in your life\" \"how you dare saying that?\" i uttered. he was making me nervous. \"calm down please\" i saw how a tear drop went from his eye. i went closer. we were standing in front of each-other, looking right at one -another' eyes. i was hurt. i didn't even wanna imagine how it looked like not seeing his hazel eyes any more. i couldn't. i had so many feels right then. i thought i was going to explode soon. imagine, how someone you love , someone who means everything to you, some one who is a very best friend of you leaves you is. i couldn't take that anymore. i looked down at his body. his pale body. was i ever going to see it again? i put my hand on it. firstly on his chest. then moved it and caressed his \"beautiful\" body. i felt it right then. i couldn't. i couldn't make myself not to cry. i was touching him and god knew if i ever was going to touch him like that again. tears came from my eyes. he was looking at my hand put on his body. he touch it and held it for a little time. i looked up at him. he was looking at me right in my eyes. my eyes were wet, watered. so was his. i didn't know what happened and what made him do this but he put his hands around me, pulled me closer and hugged me. that was enough for me to make me cry loudly. i couldn't keep my crying off and started crying. yeah. i was crying loudly and whispering him not to go. my tears were watering his chest. \"Frank. don't cry please\" he whispered. i was never going to be with him like that again. he was going. he was leaving me. he was my best fucking friend. yeah. i still liked to think that he was nothing more than a best friend to me. at least i wanted to believe that but i was ailing. he mean everything to me. i didn't know what was up with me. i needed to be with him. i needed to feel him. oh how good it was to be in his arms. i was still crying. \"you cry now\" he started. \"but you won't cry about it after year or less. i am nothing in your life Frank. nothing. make yourself believe it.\" he said. that amazed me how he was asking me to say he was nothing to me when he meant the world to me. but i like being there and wasn't going to say something. his voice was so sad. i felt like.. it felt like he was crying too. i couldn't see it because i had my head in his arms but his voice sounded so painful. he had to be crying too. that hurt my heart more. if he didn't wanna do that, why was he doing it anyway? i wanted to stay there for a long time because that was the last time we were like that. after some minutes being hugging him, i asked him. \"doesn't this everything mean you're going back to New York?\" he put his hands away from me. i looked at his eyes. \"yeah Frank\" he uttered. okay. i knew that anyway but him saying it was probably the most hurtful moment in my life. there was when my life was going to end. i didn't say anything. just wiped my tears and went away.[Chapter 14] it was Sunday. i was at home all day. i wasn't coming out of my room. tomorrow Gerard was going to officially leave school. tomorrow i was going to loose him forever. mom asked me what was up with me but i didn't say anything. i didn't even eat anything that day. at mom's shop, owners had delievered new product so my mom had to be there the whole day. at night too. i was going to stay alone all day. \"baby.\" she said.\" i can't leave you alone the whole day\" \"i will be alright mom\" i told her. \"Frankie\" she stated. \"no. im not gonna be here for 1 day. aren't you gonna be scared at night?\" \"no, mom\" i said, tho i was afraid of staying alone. our district was pretty scaring. many accidents were happening. yeh. i was scared of staying alone the whole night. i was just 16. i really was, but i didn't wanna tell her. \"Frank!\" she started. \"im not gonna leave you here the whole night. i will search someone to be with you while im not here.\" she started thinking. \"i could ask Lily, but she works with me and has to come with me, oh, wait! \" she yelled and told me to wait there. i didn't care what she was going to do. i wanted to be alone but if someone stayed with me, that was okay too because i wasn't going to come out of my room anyway. all i wanted was me to be dead. my life lost a purpose to live. i had no reason to live. i had no one to make me wanna live. of course there was my mom, i loved her more than everyone and everything, but without Gerard... without Gerard i didn't wanna live anymore. i could kill myself, i really wanted, but the only reason i wasn't doing that was my mom. she lost my dad and losing me would be tragic to her. that was stoping me from killing myself. mom didn't appear for 2 hours and half. maybe she was searching for someone but there was no need. finally she appeared. she came in and started searching for something. she didn't say anything to me. who did she search? i waited for her for some minutes to tell me anything but she wasn't. \"mom\" i started. \"yeah, baby\" she answered. \"im searching for my uniform and i will go in about 15 minutes.\" \"who did you search for me?\" i asked. \"oh.. Gerard baby\" what? no. i wasn't going to stay with Gerard. of course! how couldn't i guess. she talked about Lily coouldn't be able to say with me. she asked Gerard. of course. ugh. \"no mom!\" i stated. \"im not gonna stay with him\" she looked at me confused. \"what?\" she asked. \"yeah. i don't wanna be here, with him\" i said. i was really angry with him. i didn't wanna see him. \"you have to tell me what happened\" she said \"nothing\" i said. \"really? he didn't wanna stay with you either. i was asking him for this for 2 hours Frank. what happened between you two?\" \"huh. he didn't wanna stay with me? okay then, where is he? tell him i don't wanna stay with him either.\" \"Frank. he's in a shop. he will come here in 15 minutes. don't tell him this.\" \"why? i don't want to be with him. tell him this. i don't want.\" i stated. i really didn't want this to happen. i was really angry with him for leaving me that simply. \"Frank stop! tell me what happened. he was like this too. ddid you fight?\" \"no mom, we didn't\" \"i said that you will stay with him. we aren't going to talk about this anymore. get it? i have no one else to ask. or rather, i have no one like Gerard to trust.\" \"and you trust him?\" i asked geting angry. i didn't trust him anymore. \"yeah Frank, i do.\" she looked confused. \"okay.\" i uttered. not wanting to continue this dialogue. i couldn''t change it. Gerard was going to stay with me. \"he's at shop, he wanted to buy some nutella. i don't know why, but you like it right?\" ugh. nutella. fucking nutella. i once told Gerard that i loved them more than anything. \"what?\" i asked from excitement. Gerard was buying them? was this what i thought? i remember me telling him i loved nutella. ugh. \"Frank. yeah. don't you love them?\" \"i do but..\" \"stop\" she said whispering. she didn't let me finish my sentence. \"stop Frank, he's coming\" she kept whispering. my heart started beating faster. what was going to happen that day?uh. wake up Frank. nothing of course. he was still going to leave my class and go to New York. he came in. i didn't stand up. i was sitting on the chair. \"im here\" i told mom. \"thank Gerard. i will be back tomorrow.\" mom uttered and pointed me to stand up. i sighed and stood up. Gerard looked at me. i was looking at him but i was really angry. \"um.. hey\" he said. i didn't say anything and looked at mom. \"Frank. Gerard said hello\" she stated. \"it's okay Sarah\" Gerard uttered and put his nutellas on the table. \"okay Gerard. thank you again.\" mom said.\" politally\" she warned me and left house. i sat on my armchair again. he was standing for some minutes. then sat on the chair. i was really angry with him. how could he even look at my eyes? how? after some minutes of silence he said. \"um.. i bought this for you.\" at first i didn't say anything but then said. \"i don't need them, take with you on your way to New York\" Gerard sighed and looked away. he didn't say anything. that made me even angrier. i was sad for him, he was the reason for me being like this all day, and he didn't even say anything to calm me down. i stood up and went in my room. i layed on my bed thinking about things, thinking about that bastard. what had he done to me.. ugh.. what should i do? i still loved him. he was still my saviour and not only a best friend to me. more. something more. i was really tired. what was Gerard thinking at that moment? what was he doing? i was so fucking tired. i fell asleep while thinking about my awful life. when i woke up, it was eight o'clock. ugh. i slept on 3 and woke up on 8. that wasn't surprising. i hadn't slept for many days. i stood up and went out of my room. Gerard was sitting on the sofa and watching TV. ugh. i felt much love for him that moment, how i wanted him to stay here. the fact that after one day, i wasn't going to see him anymore was killing me. he maybe heard that noise of the door and looked at me. \"you woke up?\" he asked as if nothing had happened. \"yes\" i told him. \"Frank. come on.. please stop being like this\" he uttered. \"how do you even ask me that?\" i was surprised. he was asking me to fit in the fact that he was leaving me. \"i know you don't like being with me but please. stop. only for one day. one day\" he said and that made me even angrier. \"are you okay?\" i nearly yelled. \"i don't want you to leave my class because i want to be with you. are you happy for the fact that from tomorrow you aren't going to see me? you're happy, it seems\" i said ironically. \"does my face expression tell you im happy?\" he said and stood up from the sofa. \"why are you leaving then?\" \"you start it all over again, Frank\" \"yeah, i do. because when someone does something, it happends for reason. everything happends for a reason. you dom't have any reason\" \"but i do\" \"you don't\" \"i do, Frank\" \"tell me if you do\" \"that's the problem. i can't tell you\" \"why? i need you so much. i want you so much. i want to be with you so much. so fucking much\" i uttered. \"Frank. you're talking strangely.\" he said. \"yeah. you made me like this. why can't you get it? i need you here, to be with me\" \"stop Frank. stop\" \"no. i won't stop, during this time while you were at school, we tried to kiss for many times. you know what? im not regretting any of them. yeah. i wanted and i want it now too\" i said. i didn't know what i was saying. the only thing i wanted was him to stay there and not go from school and from New Jersey. \"Frank.. you don't know what you're talking about. we're both guys.\" he muttered. \"i know.. what then? what? it makes no difference.\" Gerard sighed. i think i was finally saying to him everything i felt and i think it was the time, when i had to clear my minds up and see what Gerard really meant to me. \"you don't know what you're saying. i repeat\" he said. i felt how he had got nervous and how he got amazed at the same time. \"listen now. you came here. become a teacher of my class. saved me for many times, defended me, became my best friend, kissed me, yeah, you kissed me and now you are leaving me? you are letting go of everything we'd done?\" i told him everything i was thinking about that moment. everything that came on the tip of my tongue. \"Frank, you didn't get it right. we were only best friends\" he said. i noticed how he tried not to look at me. he was trying so hard. his tongue was saying that, but his eyes were telling me something different. \"were? why are you talking with past simple?\" \"because we can't be friends to each-other anymore\" \"why? why can't we be?\" i was confused. what was he talking about? he didn't want to be my friend anymore? or? \"i can't be your friend Frank. i can't.\" he said. ugh. yeah. of course. \"listen now, i can't be your friend either because i feel not a friendly love to you, not love, that has student for his teacher, not anything like this. i feel something different\" i said. yeah. i really did. there wasn't any lie in this sentence. \"Frank. don't you think you're overstating everything?\" he asked. this time, he was looking right at my eyes. \"no. i said truth. i said truth. i said truth\" i yelled and moved to him. when there was only 1 feet left between us, i started talking again. \"you don't even know what's going on in my heart. you don't even know how many time i have tried to think differently about you, how many times i refused my feelings to you but, everything was leading me to the fact that i didn't like at first.\" i was standing close to him and talking about my feelings to him. yeah. he was looking at my eyes but was trying to refrain so hard from doing something. i didn't know what was that something. i could very well see that he was scared. scared of what i was going to say. \"don't continue please\" he uttered. \"i will. i will. i love you\" i said and went even closer. \"i know you love me\" he said and back down a little. \"i know you love me. how can you not love me after what i did for you.\" \"im not talking about that kind of love\" i uttered and moved to him. he backed down a little again. \"you have to stop\" he whispered. he kept backing down until he didn't see that a table was standing behind him and couldn't back down anymore. \"i feel something special for you.\" i said. contented that he couldn't step backwards anymore. i moved close to him. he half-sat on the table. i moved to him , stood between his legs and went closer so that my body was touching his. he looked scared. he was scared of what i was going to do. he was trying not to do anything stupid so hard. i could very well see. \"when you kissed me, i thought i was in heaven. i thought nothing was going to stop me. i thought that i was the luckiest boy in the planet to kiss you\" i continued and moved my head closer to his. he rest his hands against the table. \"Stop please\" he uttered. \"no. i won't. you look scared\" i said. \"im not scared\" he whispered. \"you are. are you scared of kissing me?\" i asked and put my nose on his. he looked at my lips. \"why would i?\" he whispered. \"prove it then\" i said and tried to touch our lips but.. yeah. fucking bastard. he moved away. \"Frank. that's enough, stop now\" he was getting angry slowly. it made me so upset. \"are you fighting to me?\" i asked. \"im not. it's just.. you have to stop\" he uttered and moved even farther. \"why don't you wanna kiss me?\" i asked. \"i can't do this to your mom Frank. she's my friend. just think about it. would your father be happy if he'd seen you like this?\" he asked. \"yeah, he would. because i am depressed and sad when im not next to you. you mean everything to me, why can't you get it?\" i yelled. \"Frank.. will your mom accept our relationship?\" \"she will, i promise\" i said and tried to touch him but he ran away, refusing me again. \"fucking hell Gerard\" i yelled. not even calling him teacher. why should i? he wasn't my teacher anymore. \"why do you always run away from me? why? why did you appear in my life then if you were going to leave me like this?\" i was so fucking angry. \"because i didn't know i was going to fall in l..\" he stopped. \"what? finish it, now!\" i told him. what was he going to say? love? \"i meant , i.. that.. oh.. stop Frank, just stop please\" he uttered. he had got nervous. he was rubbing his hand on his leg. i saw how he sweat was coming out on his skin. \"you meant what? love?\" i asked. \"not love, leave me alone please\" he cried and put his hands on his face. suddenly a prt of me told me that i had to stop. he sat on the chair with his face in his hands again. i didn't know what he was doing. was he crying? i couldn't go to him. i just could't. i felt so sad for him at that moment. he looked so poor. i decided to stop and sat on the chair. i was looking at him for some minutes. yeah. i shouldn't have told him these everything. i didn't know what to do. i wasn't even regretting telling him about my feelings, it was just that, i regretted making him like that. after some minutes he put his head out of his hands. his hands were we. oh god. he was crying. i felt so , so bad for him but same situation was in my heart. he tried to speak. \"i regret leaving New York and coming here\" i kept quiet for some minutes. i didn't regret meeting him. positive. i liked the fact i met him. he changed my life. i sighed. \"i don't\" uttered. how i wanted to sit next to him, kiss him and tell him that there was nothing bad in his arrival. that we could be together if he wanted to. \"why am i so unlucky, why?\" he cried. \"i always do everything, that i can't get. always dream about someone i can't be with\" he uttered. he was staring at the wall. did this mean he loved me? did this mean he wanted to be with me but couldn't? did he fucking told me now that he felt as same love to me as i felt to him? what was disturbing anyway? why did he care about mom when i didn't. i didn't care about anyone. i didn't care about mom, classmates, friends, no body. the only thing that mattered to me that moment was Gerard. i wanted him so bad. there was s table in front of him. he was thirsty and took a glass to drink a water. his lips got wet. ugh. i wanted to kiss them so much, i wanted Gerard so much and suddenly i said something, that made me surprised too. \"i want you inside me Gerard\" he threw all the water he had in his mouth out. \"what?\" looked at me amazed. yeah. i said i was surprised too of what i'd said but i tried not to make him see this and looked at him normally as if i hadn't said something strange. \"Frank. what?\" he uttered. \"yeah\" i said. \"i shouldn't have agreed your mom\" he said and looked away. this made me angry. \"huh? you don't wanna be here with me?\" \"yeah. i can't be here. i can't be with you because you will make me do something ill regret then\" he uttered. \"you don't wanna be here right? or rather, you don't wanna be with me. okay\" i uttered and stood up. ran to the door. \"what are you doing?\" he asked and stood up. i ran out of my house. i was really angry with him. nobody had made me this angry before. i wanted to go somewhere , where i wasn't going to see him, where i wasn't going to hear those painful words from him. i was running with no direction. i was hearing how he was screaming to stop me. i didn't stop. i kept running. i just wanted to go anywhere but not my house. not Gerard. i turned aside so that Gerard wasn't able to see where i was. he, himself said he didn't wanna be with me. well. now he wasn't going to be with me. when Gerard voices stopped and when he wasn't anywhere around me, i stopped. i was breathing hard. i was really tired cuz i'd ran for so long. i rest against the wall and tried to rest. it was dark. at one moment, i got scared. i was alone there. no one was around me and it had to be about 9 o'clock. suddenly i heard a voice beside me. i thought it was Gerard and yelled to leave me alone but when i turned around, i found myself standing in front of a strange man with a mask on. he moved to me. i tried not to care and tried to think like he was just a man, who had to do somthing and was on his way home. yeah. but reality proved me something else. \"hey\" he smiled. he was so tall and so.. ugh.. so.. like.. he seemed to be so strong. i tried to move backwards. \"let's see what you've got\" he said. i was confused. maybe he was a thief? \"i don't have anything\" i uttered. scared of what he was going to do. he came to me. i was at the wall. i tried to move but he didn't let me. i tried to say something but he stopped me again. \"shhhh\" he uttered. \"now give me everything you have and i will leave you alive.\" i was so scared. the main problem was that i didn't have anything to give him. i was so stupid. why did i run away from house. i needed Gerard so much that moment. i was so stupid. \"but..\" i tried to speak. \"i don't have anything\" \"you don't have?\" he uttered. \"you better have little boy or you will end up your life here.\" \"no, please\" i said. i didn't wanna die, i wanted Gerard to be there so bad. yeah i was saying that i wanted to kill myself but when i really was going to die, it scared the living shit out of me. i realised that i didn't wanna die. \"so.. you don't have a money right?\" he asked. i nooded , couldn't even answer to his question. \"okay\" he said and moved away from me. i wondered what he was doing. he was looking at me for some seconds and then he hit me. he hit me on my nose. ugh. it hurt so much. i put my hands on my nose. \"you don't have right?\" he asked again and now kicked me in my stomach. i bent down. it hurt so much. ugh. i was such in pain. i was so stupid. i could be home that time, with Gerard. fighting, but it was better than this. i moaned from the pain. i was laying on the ground. he came to be and pulled my hair. \"you still done have money?\" he asked me. i was so frightened but i really didn't have anything. suddenly i heard how someone screamed my name. yeah. it was Gerard still searching me.i tried to yell to make him know i was there but that man put his hand on my mouth to stop me. i heard from the voice how he was coming to us and yeah. he appeared. he looked around. it was dark and couldn't see anything, i guess, so i bit that motherfucker bitch on his hand and yelled Gerard's name. Gerard looked around and he saw us. as soon as he did saw, he ran to me. the man tried to ran away but Gerard didn't let him. he pulled that man to him and hit him right in his face. \"what did you do to that boy?\" he yelled and hit him again. i was scared. what if that man had a weapon? my stomach and nose hurt so much. nose was bleeding. it was dark but i could still see how Gerard was beating that motherfucker. \"did you hit him?\" i heard Gerard asking. yeah. of course that man hit him too but Gerard was definitely stronger. he was yelling at that man for hitting me and for hurting me. he still cared of me. i was laying there for some minutes. i tried to stand up and stop them , i tried to stand up to help Gerard but i saw how someone ran away. then someone moved to me. i saw that it was Gerard. \"are you okay?\" he asked. i didn't say anything because he saw how i had my hands on my stomach and how my nose was bleeding. \"you're a bad boy Frank, yeah. that's what you got for not listening to me\" he was right. i was looking down. i was dark and i couldn't exactly see what was going with Gerard's face and where did that man hit but he moaned for several times, that meant that something hurt him. it was my fault. \"im sorry\" i said. \"okay. put your arm on my shoulder Frank\" he said, \"i can move for my own\" i said, though i couldn't. \"put it please.\" he said. he could read everything i was thinking. i put my arm on his shoulder and rest against him. yeah, i could move but i wanted to be close to him. we walked home. i hadn't said anything during the road. i felt guilty. when we went in, i was so ashamed of what i did. i couldn't even look at his eyes. he helped me so sit on the chair. yeah. i could sit for my own but i told him i couldn't, i like being close to him and feeling his touch. he sat right in front of me and looked at me. i looked at him too. i just saw the bruises he had on his face. i got worried. \"don't worry\" he said. \"it doesn't hurt\" it was my fault. \"it's my fault\" i uttered. \"no, okay. you don't have to feel guilty. does your nose hurt you?\" he asked and came to me. he touched my nose. i moaned. \"where's cotton ?\" he asked. i pointed him. he took a cotton and tried to try the blood i had under my nose. it wasn't bleeding anymore. \"hold the cotton on your nose for some minutes\" he told me and tried to move but i put my hand on his and stopped him. he looked down at first but then looked at my eyes. i kissed his hand. \"Frank\" he said. \"im sorry\" i said. my eyes were watering. so were his. \"Frank. i don't like seeing you hurt\" he uttered. \"i don't like it either. im sorry\" i said. \"nothing hurts me, trust me\" i said. \"you know what/\" he asked. \"give me your guitar please\" guitar? why did he need tha guitar? \"why do you need it?\" \"i have to sing you something\" he said and tried to stop a tear that was coming from his eye. \"but.. doesn't your bruises hurt?\" \"no, give me please. if you want of..\" i didn't let him finish and said to him and i wanted it, of course. i wanted. i stood up to take my guitar. \"but.. Frank, you couldn't move just five minutes ago\" he said. \"i know\" i just replied this and went to my room to take my guitar. \"what's the name of the song?\" i asked. he took my guitar and asked me to sit right in front of him. i loved him so much. yeah. i did. it was so painful moment in my life. \"the world is ugly\" he said. the name told me that it had to be a great song. i couldn't dare talk to him about thing we were talking about til i ran from house. so many feel right then. he was looking at my eyes. i saw the pain in his eyes. i saw the sadness. his eyes were usually so brightened when we were talking to each-other before but that time. neither mine were brightening, nor his. \"Frank\" he started. \"i want you to listen to the lyrics carefully. i want you to feel them and see the deep meaning of them. i tried so hard for writing it.\" he took the guitar and prepared to start playing. i forgot everything that was hurting me. his voice was the only medicine i needed. the music was so beautiful. it was a sad song. well. at least in seemed to be from music. Gerard was so talanted. \"These are the eyes and the lies of the taken\" he started singing. ugh his voice. his. fucking. voice. i was just staring at him. \"These are their hearts but their hearts don t beat like ours They burn, cuz they are all afraid, for everyone of us There's an army of them, but you'll never fight alone Cuz I wanted you to know\" these fucking words. he was my saviour yeah, he saved me for many times. was he trying to say that despite of his leaving i was never going to be alone? \"That the world is ugly, But you re beautiful to me Well are you thinking of me, now? (now)\" my eyes were watering slowly. \"These are the nights and the lights that we fade in These are the words, but the words aren't coming out They burn cuz they are hard to say For every failing sun, there s a morning after Though I m empty when you go I just wanted you to know That the world is ugly, but you re beautiful to me Are you thinking of me? Like I m thinking of you? I would say I'm sorry though, though I really need to go I just wanted you to know I wanted you to know I wanted you to know I m thinking of you Every night, every day\" ah those words. ugh. yeah. i could relate it to myself. yeah. he was thinking of me just like i was thinking of him, but he really needed to go, though he was sorry about that. and the main. he was thinking of me every night and every day. ugh. i couldn't just make myself not to cry. tears came from my eyes. i was still looking right at his eyes. so was he. his eyes were wet too. i felt such a big love to him. i felt how i really needed him and i felt how i really loved him. \"These are the lies and the lives of the taken These are the hearts but their hearts don t beat like ours They burn, cuz they are all afraid But mine beats twice as hard Cuz the world is ugly, but you re beautiful to me! Are you thinking of me? Like I m thinking of you? I would say I m sorry though, though I really need to go I just wanted you to know That the world is ugly, but you re beautiful to me (I just wanted you to know) Are you thinking of me?\" that song broke my heart so much. Gerard's voice was making everything worse. i was never really going to hear those words from him again, his voice, his sweet voice. ugh. i really couldn't keep crying off. the song was finishing. the aast lines were left. \"Stop your crying Help this feeling Dry your eyes and start believing There s one thing they;ll never take from you\" and then there was the extra lines of the song. \"One day, like this, we ll never be the same, Never, forever like ghosts in the snow, like ghosts in the sun\" he finished playing the song and put guitar down. then looked at me to see my reaction. i was drawning in my tears. i saw how several drops of tear came from his eyes. \"don't cry please\" he said. \"i can't\" i cried. \"you tell me that you think of me just like i think of you but you need to go at the same time, now tell me, how not to cry? \"Frank. im sorry. i just wanted you to know\" he uttered. \"that you're thinking of me every night and every day?\" i cried. \"i said everything with this song\" \"yeh. you said that you love me Gerard\" i told him. yeah. didn't he say that? i think i wasn't mistaking. \"stop. i sang this to you. now it's your choice what you'll believe in.\" he said and tried to stop tears. \"you're rejecting me again, but you're empty without me\" i uttered and dried my tears. \"okay\" added and just stood up, didn't say anything to him and went to my room. i was so tired. i wanted to stay alone and cry out loud. yeah. i cried my heart out. i didn't care Gerard was standing outside my room. i wanted to cry loudly and did so. cried everything i had in my heart, everything that was hurting me and bringing me pain out. i just wanted to sleep. my heart was hurting. my head was hurting. also nose and stomach. yeah. plus everything that happened with Gerard, someone tried to beat me and take everything i had. i didn't have anything though. yeah. everything was so complicated. when i finally dared to tell everything i felt to Gerard, he decided to go from here and leave me alone. i layed on my bed and was like that was half an hour. i was so sick. feeling sick, feeling down. i was still crying but not that hard. after some minutes i heard how my door opened. Gerard came in. i pretended that i was asleep and close my eyes. he came to my bed and sat on it. i opened my eyes a little to see what he was doing. he was looking at me. i couldn't see if he was crying or not. he came close to me and kissed on my hair, then on my forehead. \"im sorry\" he whispered. he was there for some minutes and then went. i opened my eyes as soon as he left. i couldn't sleep. i couldn't lay. i waited for 5 minutes and then got up. i just couldn't stay there like that. i liked it or not, i had to go out. when i went out of my room, i saw Gerard was in the kitchen. it was like 12. \"why aren't you sleeping?\" Gerard asked. \"i don't feel sleepy\" i answered. \"but you have to go to school tomorrow\" he said. \"i've already said. im not going to school tomorrow. not tomorrow and not ever\" i stated. \"Frank, please. stop being like that\" he said. \"leave me alone\" i uttered and went to the window. it was a dark night. dark, just like the night, when we first kissed each-other. \"eat something\" he uttered. \"you haven't ate anything the whole day\" \"im not hungry\" i simply said. the night was hurting me so much, i remembered that feeling, i remembered how it everything happened. \"this night\" i uttered. \"what?\" he asked. \"this night. \" i repeated. \"it looks like the night when we first kissed each-other\" i said. Gerard came to the window and looked from it. \"yeah. it looks\" he said. i looked at him. there was such a pain on his face. he looked at me too. \"tomorrow you will leave\" i uttered and looked down. \"yeah Frank. but i will always remember you\" tears were starting to come to my eyes. \"we could have been really good with each-other, together\" i said and looked from the window. \"Frank, you're starting it all over again.\" Gerard said. \"but i can't live without you\" i cried. \" i don't like seeing you like this\" Gerard said. \"you are a teenager, i want you to be like you used to when you were at school. i want you to be as happy as you were\" he uttered. \"really? im never gonna be like that again. that was because i had you. now that you are going, im gonna kill myself. i just can't live like this\" i said. i looked away to hide my tears. \"look at me\" Gerard said. i tried to stop tears but i couldn't. i looked at him. \"don't cry please\" he said and dried my tears. \"what can i do to stop you from crying?\" he asked. \"except of staying here?\" \"except of that?\" i asked ironically. \"nothing\" i uttered and put his hands away from my cheek. Gerard sighed. \"Frank\" he started. \"you're gonna regret it then\" he said after some minutes of silence. i looked at him. did this mean that i was getting what i wanted? \"no, im not going to. i want you so much\" i said and went to him closer. \"Frank. don't teach me. i know that much. i know. you're gonna regret it. plus i just can't do this to your mom\" he uttered. \"fuck you\" i yelled. he looked at me surprised. \"i don't care about this and why do you? why do you care about my mom and i don't? of course, i love her so much but i wanna be with you so much too.\" i yelled. \"i just can't get what you feel about me. do you love me or do you hate me?\" \"Frank calm down\" Gerard said. \"no, answer me, answer me\" i said and thrusted him.. \"Frank..\" he started. \"answer me\" i yelled. i was still crying. \"Frank. i will tell you if you calm down and stop thrusting and hitting me\" he said. i stopped doing that slowly. i'd turned into the girl, who's angry with her boyfriend. what had i become? what? and all of this because of Gerard. \"Frank\" he started. \"you know the answer.\"he stopped and looked down. \"i love you more than i love myself.\" he uttered. that answer made ma a little better. \"prove it then, prove it\" i uttered. as soon as i said that he came to me, pulled me to him with his hands put on my back , and touched his lips with mine. i was surprised of what he did. i could have never imagined this was going to happen here. i thought i had already lost him but.. no.. this time he kissed me. i opened my month and started moving it. not so slowly. i had wanted this for a long time and this time had finally come. i put my hands around him. i had finally gotten what i wanted. his lips were so soft and slimy. his mouth fell open and i found my tongue sliding into his slimy, wet mouth. he moved his mouth even faster as if, he wanted to do this for a long time too. i've only kissed him once but this kiss was different. he tasted so good. his lips, his tongue which was meeting mine and moving in my mouth. his slimy and soft lips, ugh. he was a master of kissing. yeah. my heart was beating faster. ugh. i didn't know what was going to happen but i wanted anything with him. i was ready to do everything with him. i was breathing hard, so was he. he started moving his hands on my back. i was trembling. his hands moving on my back, i was feeling him. he slid his right hand up to grip my hair. i put mine under his shirt and started touching his pale, white body which i wanted to touch and feel for so long. he moved his slimy mouth on my neck now. he licked it and sucked on it. moans escaped from my opened mouth. i put my hands in his hair and bit down on my bottom lip. fuck. it felt so good. he moved his lips on my throat. his mouth was so warm. i had my eyes closed. Gerard had his fingers curling into the waist of my jeans, stroking my waist. he breathed at my ear, panting against my skin and whispering. \"Frank.. we.. i'll stop if you.. want\" \"no..\" i moaned. \"let's go to my room\" i said. \"okay\" he breathed within his kisses on my neck with his wet and slimy lips. he lifted me. i put my legs around his waist and continued kissing him very hard.[Chapter 15] we went in my room. the door was opened, seemed i'd left it like that when i went out of it. Gerard and me were still kissing. i didn't know what was going to happen, i didn't know if we were going to have something there, but i really wanted these all. i've never tried having sex with someone before, i wasn't interested in having sex with girls and especially with boys, but this time, i really wanted it to happen. i wanted to have sex with Gerard, i didn't care if i was going to regret, even though i was pretty sure i wasn't. kissing him felt like flying, especially like this. he had his hands held on my back. i layed on my bed. he layed on me, resting against his hands. he continued kissing on my neck, i felt his mouth slip along my jaw, his hot breath against my ear. i felt something warm, wet, silky slip around the shell of my ear. Gerard's tongue was curling round my lobe. his hand stroke down my throat to my chest. i took a deep breath. it felt awesome. i was kissing him and he was letting me touch him wherever i wanted. he was mine, he was mine that time. i wasn't letting myself touch him, i couldn't, i was watching him doing stuff to me and kissing. i wanted it, yeah, i did. i felt his fingers stroking my hand. i looked at him kissing my chest. he was perfect. i was feeling strangely, like, i felt that i was going to explode, i couldn't feel my chest. i could feel the warmth of his lips. he looked up at me and continued kissing on my lips, his tongue started to stroke in my mouth, i closed my eyes. he kissed on my bottom lip and sucked on it. then started kissing my throat again. his warm mouth was so pleasurable. he sucked on my neck. i moaned. it felt good. \"ugh..\" i uttered. \"it feels... oh.. good\" i tried to speak but couldn't. i needed not to speak, i needed to feel him this time, i needed to keep silence and enjoy this moment as much as i could. i saw how he smiled within his kisses on my neck. i felt his warm fingers running through my hair. we still had our shirts on. he put his hand under my shirt and moved it on my body. he was still kissing on my neck. it felt awesome. yeah. i was with a boy and at the same time, i wasn't as sure i wanted everything to happen as i was before. everything felt good but i just thought about my mom. if i told him about this, he would hate on me forever, so i decided to stop and not to think about this. i was with him, finally i was kissing him and going to become his own. that was enough for me. i wanted it to happen. as soon as i thought this, he stopped kissing me and asked me: \"Frank\" he was breathing hard. \"you wanna stop?\" he asked. \"oh, no\" i answered. i didn't. finally i brought him to my bed and there was no way i was going to refuse everything. \"kay, i'll take your shirt off then\" he said. i nooded. He licked from my collar bone all the way up to my ear. He gave me some last kisses on my lips before undoing my shirt. He was still on my hips, his growing warm erection just meters away from mine. He undid the buttons on my shirt and tore it off, slinging it on the floor afterwards. He placed his warm soft hands on my bare chest, gliding them up to my nipples; he then leaned in kissing all the way up to them, gently licking my nipples and running little circles around them with his tongue. i couldn't make myself shut up. i moaned. it was fucking pleasant. i ran my fingers through his hair as he moved his head over my body, kissing my chest. he slid his right hand on my body and put it on my hip. yeah. running my fingers through his hair was so tough of me. but i needed to do something. i was going to do this thing in my life for the first time and this thing was fucking important to me me. it could affect on my life, yeah. i didn't know how, negatively or positively. well. at the end, i was laying on that bed, i wanted this or not, i was laying there and was going to do stuff with him but hey Frank. i'd wanted this for so long right then, there wasn't time for refusing it, i wanted it and it was going to happen. he was still kissing on my stomach. then he moved a little and sat on the bed. i wondered what we was doing. he started undoing his buttons on his shirt. yeah. i was finally going to touch his body, his \"beautiful body\" just as much as i wanted. i bit my bottom lip. my hair was laying on my eyes. i tried to put them away so i could watch him taking off his shirt . he undid all of his buttons and threw his shirt away. then he went back to his old position and continued kissing me on my chest. i wanted to touch his fucking body. i finally could touch it, finally there was nothing wrong in doing that. i put my both hands on his back and slid them on it. his back was so warm. i was feeling his breathing, his stomach moving on me. we were both breathing hard. i've never imagined my first sex was going to be like this and especially with man. i thought it was easy to have sex before but when i was going to do it in reality, i got a little scared. i could've never imagined kissing and making out with someone was this good but.. not with everyone. i loved Gerard and that was why it felt so good for me. i wanted to call him \"mine\", i wanted him inside me. i glided my hand from the top of his back to the bottom. when i finally felt his belt, i stopped moving my hands and rest them on the bottom of his back. after some kisses he gave me on my nipples, he searched for my hand laying on his back and put it on the bed with his hand on it. then he ran his fingers through mine and pressed his hand on mine as much as he could. we were holding hands. i was really excited. he was giving me some looks to make sure i still wanted these all. of course i did. there was no way i was refusing this. once again, i wanted to be his. he continued kissing on my neck. as i felt his breathing on my neck, it tickled and i smiled. he looked up at me, pleased that i smiled and continued kissing on my cheek. there was no place left on my face he hadn't kissed. he was pressing his hands against my hips. i was feeling his warm tongue on my forehead. yeah. not his mouth but tongue. he wasn't only stopping on kissing with his mouth. he started licking my face. i felt so pleased being next to him. the only thing i'd done in my life, sexual, was masturbation. i'd only masturbated before, never thought about having an actual sex. i didn't know how it felt. i was still laying there knowing he wasn't going to hurt me. i dared to kiss him back. i became more courageous and started kissing on his neck. he seemed pleased. he let me do that and stopped kissing. i moved my tongue over his pale and warm skin. he moaned. that made me even more mad and crazy. yeah. he used to drive me crazy. we were kissing like that. ugh. if anyone knew how happy i was right then. i let him do whatever he wanted to do with me, i wanted him so bad. he wasn't staying on kissing my body parts for so long, he was moving quickly. i felt that he wanted to do this for a long time too and now wanted to feel me just as much as he could. i compreheded that we weren't only going to stop on kissing. Gerard's next movement made me release that. he opened my belt and undid my zipper. i looked down at his hand as he did saw. he looked up at me, still not sure if i wanted this or not. when he didn't see the displeasant on my face of his action, he continued doing what he did. he put his hand inside my boxer and for the first time, someone else touched my crotch. i sighed. i didn't think it was going to happen. i got more nervous. especially when he started moving his hand slowly. the feeling i got was fucking perfect. i couldn't make myself shut the fuck up, because i was full of feels. i moaned. my mouth dropped open and i began to lean into him for support as he began to thumb the head of my cock. Encouraged by my obvious pleasure and body language ran his fingers up the underside several times before going back to stroking me again. he was rhythmically moving his hand. my heart rate quickened. i'd done this for many times for my own but i've never thought of someone doing this to me. he was slowly starting stroking on my crotch faster. as he was going faster, i felt more and more pleasure in my stomach.I could feel the pleasure grow stronger and I tugged on the sheets mindlessly. i felt how something dropped in my stomach. i couldn't anymore and firmly pressed my hand on his body, making him moan. yeah. i probably hurt him, because i was full of feels, i could explode if he hadn't stopped there. i wasn't really thinking of shame or something like that in that moment. the only thing mattering to me was that the more he stroke his hand on my dick, the more i was getting full of feels.. he looked at me. he was looking at my face during doing that. maybe my face was making him crazy and he liked to watch me moan. i felt that i was going to come out at any moment. and suddenly he stopped stroking my crotch and put his hand on my body again and hungrily pressed my lips to his firmly. I could feel his lips form a smile against mine, and then he prodded his tongue at my lips asking for access, I happily granted as his tongue twirled and explored my mouth. I then joined my tongue and swirled it round with his, tasting him more and making the kiss more passionate and deeper than ever. i wrapped his hand up around behind my head again and pulled him in for a more passionate kiss. \"you're p-perfect\" he uttered. i was so pleased for him saying that and smiled. \"do you still feel like coming\" he breathed in my ear. \"i think \" i was breathing too hard to speak. \"i think it's stopped\" i finished. the adorable smile covered his face. ugh. how much i loved him. he broke from the kiss and went down. i wondered what he was doing but then got everything as he went to my cock. he was going to give me blow job. i guessed that it was going to be super pleasurable and fantastic and dropped my head . And as soon as i did so i felt something warm around my dick. i bucked my hips up and placed my hands in his hair. he licked my base all the way to the tip of my dick, slid his tongue down to my balls, and took them into his mouth. I cried out in pleasure as his throat contracted and he hollowed his cheeks to grip onto my foreskin tightly. My hips bucked as he began to blow me so he placed his hands firmly on my hips to keep them down. i gasped in pleasure. I began to breathe harder and faster, small noises erupting from my mouth. his tongue was all over my crotch, i felt how it was sliding on it and leaving noises of his slimy, wet mouth. it was fantastic. god. i had my head dropped back. my mouth fell open. i was breathing really hard. my stomach moving faster. my hair got sweaty. i was hot. it was so pleasurable. i rolled my eyes back in my head and moaned. \"uh... oh\" i uttered. it turned him on more and more and started touching my balls while moving his head up and down on my cock. i had my hands held on the mattress but moved them on his head. i stroke my fingers in his hear and pushed him down. i helped his head go up and down and suck my dick more and more. i couldn't make my eyes go back to it's position. it was so pleasurable. Gerard finally took me in his mouth, pushing my member deep down his throat. 'Oh fuck…\" i uttered. This was so much better than masturbation. I had another man's lips around my fucking penis. He was holding the base of it in his hands. He kissed the tip, sliding his tongue softly around the head. this made me even crazier. i was moaning so hard but was trying to stop myself from doing that cuz, i was in my fucking house and i didn't want my neighbours to hear it and then tell my mom. i was like, well. it felt fantastic. i could feel i was about to cum!. i didn't wanna come there, on my bed. i still couldn't let him stop from what he was doing. it was so fucking perfect. that was the thing i'd wanted for so long then. Gerard licked the head of my dick for the last time and came to kiss on my nipples again. i had my zipper opened. i thought that maybe putting my pants off was a good idea but decided to stop because he prefered doing what he was. on the other hand i wanted it very much. he continued kissing on my neck and sucking on it. i had my eyes closed. i wanted it to happen now. \"undress me\" i breathed. \"okay\" he uttered. i had my shirt already off. Gerard put his hands on my trousers and started moving it from my thighs. i was watching him undress me. he put my pants off and threw them away just like my shirt. when it came to my boxers, i got a little shamed. i'd never been naked with anybody else before. Gerard started kissing and licking my thighs as he was undressig my boxers. when my underwear was finally moved from my body, i felt a little strange. i was laying there, with a man, fully naked. wasn't it strange? that wasn't everything. Gerard was going to get undressed too right? i was going to see his crotch for the first time. i felt that i wanted this everything but i was scared. i was afraid that it was going to be painful. as soon as he finished undressing me, he put his clothes off too. he had only his pants on too. when he removed his pants, i saw his dick, i could see his boner from his underwear. he was kissing me on my neck during this time. when i finally removed his boxers, i couldn't help but go mad. i fucking saw his penis for the first time. well. it was bigger than mine. probably because i was 16 yet. i tried not to look at his cock, which was really hard. it drove me crazy. Gerard's dick was very hard. his fucking boner. he was trying not to look at my dick too not to make me feel uncomfortable. he went back to his old position. i felt his crotch on my skin. we were touching each-other, skin-to-skin. i felt his boner between my legs, ugh. \"are you feeling uncomfortable? do you wanna stop?\" he asked me. he wasn't kissing me this time. i didn't want everything to stop so i told him that he could keep doing what he wanted with me. \"F-Frank\" he uttered. \"yeah\" i said and looked at his eyes. \"are you sure you want this?\" he asked. i stopped for a little while. i was afraid. i wanted but i was afraid. but fucking Frank. was this why you were fighting for, for so long? to get scared and stop everything? \"yeah\" i finally answered. \"i need an exact answer Frank. i will do whatever you want\" he said. \"no matter how much i want this\" \"i want..\" i said. i still couldn't bring myself saying i was afraid. he smiled. \"are you scared?\" he uttered. yeah, i was scared. how was i supposed to be? someone was going to come inside me. that wasn't easy. i''d heard it was so painful. i nooded, not knowing how was he going to react on this. \"my baby\" he uttered. i was so please for him calling me this. yeah. i was going to be his. i felt this time that i really wanted it, no matter what, i wanted. he kissed me on my forehead. \"i won't hurt you, i promise\" he uttered, kissing me again. \"okay\" i said and nooded. he told me to turn over. i guessed that he wasn't going to put his dick at first in my asshole. i felt his fingers running through my body to my hole and that was when i got that he was going to stuck his fingers into my hole. maybe it was needed. he wasn't doing anything that wasn't good or needed. it wasn't a good thing, i knew and he wouldn't have done it if it wasn't nasasarry in that moment. i felt how my heart started beating faster, not knowing how it felt and what was going to happen. i felt how something dropped in my stomach when i felt something sliding into me. he put his first finger in me. \"ugh\" i uttered. it wasn't that hurtful but it felt fucking shitty. i felt how he put his other fingers into my hole too and how he started moving them slowly, in and out. it wasn't that painful as i was expecting it to be. it was just that, i wasn't used to doing this. i'd never had something in me before. that was the only feeling i've got. awkwardness. he put his fingers in and out for several times. then he was done. \"that's it. your hole's bigger now and it's not gonna be that painful\" he uttered. i felt that my body wasn't belonging to me anymore. it was changed and owned by someone. i couldn't believe it was real. \"so.. are you ready?\" he asked. i toot a deep breath. we were both breathing very hard. i nooded. \"okay. i will try not to hurt you Frank\" he whispered in my ear. i was waiting for it. it was going to happen in a second or two and.. yeah.. i felt how his penis touched my ass. i took a really deep breath as i felt the head of his penis going in my hole. i felt pain and i pressed my head on the pillow, holding his hand so tightly. \"it gets better, i promise\" he breathed though the kisses he was giving me on my neck. he was slowly putting his dick inside of me. it hurt. it hurt so much. i couldn't have imagined it was this hurtful. his fingers didn't hurt, yeah, but it was probably because his fingers were way too short compared to his crotch. i sighed. he was putting his dick further and further, telling me we were almost there. he was probably putting his dick inside of me slowly, for like 2-3 minutes but it felt like the whole day. his words weren't helping me, neither his promises. it hurt. i knew it was going to be painful from the very first moment i talked to him about coming inside of me but this hurtful? nope. this was way too much. but this was only the beginning. he was right inside of me. inside. of. me. when he finally put his dick fully in my body, told me to get ready for his next action. i closed my eyes, not knowing how he was going to act then. he moved his dick out of my hole for some little distance. i felt more pain. i was such in pain. then he started moving in and out slowly. yeah. he could move faster, couldn't he? but he was caring of me. he promised that he was going to do everything to make me feel less pain and he really was. he was doing it slowly. he was kissing on my neck at the same time. i was holding his hand tightly and tightly. i couldn't take the pain i was feeling. when he repeated that action for several times, it started hurting less and less. he was moving himself rhythmycally. in and out. he was fucking inside of me. i was feeling him inside my body. we were each-other, we were moving as one person, we were one person. i was so happy i did it. despite of the pain i was feeling, i was still happy because i was his, yeah, i was finally his own, and he was my own. he hit the spot inside of me. i wasn't only feeling the pain right after that. it became to be pleasurable too. i'd never heard his orgasms before. they were amazing. his moans, his fucking moans, the feeling that he was making an orgasm voices because of me, i was bringing him pleasure. yeah, i was screaming too, way too loud. well, how was i supposed to behave? it was painful. he started kissing on my ear, whispering that i was perfect. he was the one who was perfect. he kissed me on my lips and sucked on the bottom one. my crotch was hard again. i was turned on by his orgasms, ugh. he was so fucking pleasurable. he started moving a little faster when he heard that i wasn't screaming that much from pain. we were both bathed in sweat. the tips of his hair, were sweaty. he put his hand into my hair and started pulling it from pleasure. this was it. i'd done it with him. i fucked with him. i became his. i was moaning hard. him whispering to me that my moans were turning him on and on made me ever crazier. i wasn't feeling that much pain that moment. we were fucking for so long. Gerard made himself move slower again, whispering to me. \"Frankie\" he called me Frankie. the name, which only my mom and dad were using. but i didn't mind. i was his, as i was my mom's and he had a right to call me that. \"y-y-yeah\" i breathed. words were hardly coming out of my mouth. fuck. he was perfect at this. 'baby, y-you..uh.. you.. a-are mine n-now\" he finally finished himself. i smiled, even though i was feeling some pain. \"i love y-you\" i uttered. \"me too\" he said. we were nearly done. i was regretting anything. opposite. i was very happy. this happened. finally. the thing i dreamed of for so long happened. we were layin together on my bed, i was laying right between his arms. i was so happy and lucky at the same time. this man, this perfect man became mine and i became his. i wasn't thinking of my mom or something like that at the moment. i was the happiest man alive. he was caressing my hair. i was so tired. i was never going to forget that night. the night when we became each-other, the moment when we became one-another's, the night when we started becoming one person and started moving as one person. that was it, we did it. we were against the world, maybe this wasn't so holy and wasn't good to do but we still did it. i was never a holy person. neither was he. that only thing mattering to me that moment was me and Gerard. our love.[Chapter 16] i thought i was in a dream. i fucking had sex with Gerard. well, if Lily and mom knew that. they were probably going to go mad. i personally was so amazed. i've never supported gay marriage and gay couples and now? i became to be one of them. it felt awkward to think i was gay but still. i was really happy being in Gerard's arms. i didn't know what was going to happen tomorrow, what was going to happen when my mom sooner or later gets to know about us, i didn't know. it was such a mess in my head. all i knew was that i was laying in my bed, with the man i loved and was sharing love with him. i didn't need anything more. i wasn't feeling any regrettness. i wasn't sleeping for too long. then i fell asleep for like 20 minutes, well, when i woke up, it was already like 10 o'clock. i didn't know where i was at first. then i felt how Gerard was caressing my hair and remembered everything. i remembered the last night, how me and Gerard had sex. i looked up at him. i was laying between his arms. he smiled. \"you woke up?\" whispered. i noded. i was feeling strangely. well, i should have. i did the thing like this for the first time in my life, my back was hurting a little. well. i was laying fully naked with a man. that was enough to feel strange. \"how do you feel?\" he asked. i was feeling the air that was coming out of his mouth while he was talking blowing on my neck. i felt him breathing, his stomach moving while he breathed. his heart, beating fast. i smiled. he smiled too, pleased about my reaction. \"you feel good\" he stated, even though i hadn't said i felt good. well, what was i supposed to feel other than that? i was feeling good. i was happy. but i couldn't look at him again. it was like, well. i was naked. with a man. i was a little ashamed. \"Frank..\" he uttered and looked down at me. i didn't answer again. \"okay, i knew you were going to regret this\" he said and tried to stand up. \"oh no\" i uttered. \"im not regretting, i swear\" i uttered and made him stay there by pulling his arms.i just couldn't tell him i was ashamed of him. we were both men but still, i was naked with somebody else for the first time. \"it's just that..\" i continued but he didn't let me finish. \"Frank, i wanna be with you but it's just me, i can't make you do that. if you don't want, we'll stop\" he uttered. still not laying. he was sitting on my bed. \"i wanna be with you too\" i uttered. \"okay. forget everything please.\" he uttered. \"let's act like nothing's happened okay?\" \"nope\" i said firmly. \"i don't want to, it's just that i did it for the first time and well..\" \"did i hurt you?\" he asked. \"no. you didn't. you never hurt me, you're very caring.\" i muttered and looked down. \"so.. what's up Frank?\" he asked. \"im a little ashamed.\" i said and i felt how my cheeks went bright red. at first he was looking at me confused. i could see this. he was silent for some minutes but then he laughed. \"is that why you act this way?\" he asked laughing. i was amazed. \"what's so funny?\" i asked, narrowing my eyes and giving him a shot by my look. \"okay, nothing\" he uttered. \"do you still wanna be in my arms?\" he asked. i nodded. of course. i did. \"i thought you were going to.. um.. reg..\" i didn't let him finish the sentence and put my hand on his lips to make him keep silent. \"im not. im not going to.\" i took a deep breath. \"i still love you\" said then. he smiled. \"you haven't slept Frank. you were asleep for like 2 hours, that's not enough\" he uttered. \"i don't feel sleepy\" i said. \"haven't you slept?\" \"nope\" he stated. \"i was looking at you sleeping, you are perfect when you sleep\" he uttered and kissed on my hair. he was just so perfect. i couldn't have imagined of a better \"lover\" (?) than he. he had beautiful insides. he was just a perfect man to me. he was an inspiration, an idol well whatever. \"it's good to be like this\" i said. \"im never gonna regret this. im so happy\" \"hahah, im happy too if you're happy, oh Frankie\" he sighed. \"that was exactly what i was afraid of, from the very first time i saw you\" \"did you fall in love with me from then?\" i asked. i was interested in that. \"hah, not from the beginning. when i was keeping seeing you, the feeling was getting deeper and deeper, see? that was why i wanted to leave your school. i was afraid this was going to happen. i loved you, i knew you did too, but i couldn't do that, you're a student, but it's okay now right?\" he asked. analizing that he was talking about stupid things. it was way too late to think of that right then. we had already had sex and what happened, happened. we couldn't change it and even if we could, i would never do that. i was happy of what i did. \"oh i see, you bastard\" i uttered. \"was that why you made me cry yesterday?\" \"im sorry\" he uttered and smiled. \"you should be\" i said and laughed. i put my head on his chest again. it was cold outside but i was warm between his arms. he was hugging me tightly. as if i was going to go somewhere and leave him, that felt stupid, because i was forever going to be with him. the night we had that night was exellent. well, if we don't include the pain but it was good too, i was with the man i loved. even pain was good with him. he was brilliant in doing the thing he did to me that night. \"may i ask you something?\" i uttered. \"yeah\" he said. \"where, ugh, like.. where did you learn doing this?\" i asked. not looking at him and looking somewhere else. \"um.. this what?\" he asked. \"this.. what you did last night\" i answered. \"have you had sex with someone else?\" \"oh haha\" he laughed. \"Frank, yeah, i have of course.\" wait. what? why was he talking like \"of course\"? yeah, i knew he was supposed to but.. well.. \"really? with who? boy or a girl?\" \"you're the first boy for me to have sex with\" he uttered. \"i''ve had sex with several women before. not my girlfriends, some bitches.\" \"ugh, \" i muttered. \"what\" he asked. \"nothing, i'll say that too when my mom sees my hickey\" i said and waited for him to react. \"oh my god. i forgot that, what are we gonna say?\" he asked. like, his voice started to get nervous. \"don't worry\" i uttered. \"i'll tell her i was in women and had sex with one of them\" i laughed. \"hey..\" he uttered. \"you just called me a woman\" he widened his eyes and lifted his eyebrows while smiling. \"okay, i joked, i will hide it just so that she can't see\" i uttered moving from my position. i felt how my hand started hurting from laying too much on it. i was feeling so comfortable with him. \"i wanna be with you everyday\" i said, after some minutes of us, being quiet. \"i know, me too but you see the problem right? we can't. your mom, my sister\" he uttered and i felt how his voice started becoming sadder. i looked at him asking him what was up. \"Frank.. i feel a little guilty.. you know.. we did what we weren't supposed to do\" \"ugh god Gerard. stop being such an asshole\" i uttered. \"why am i an asshole?\" he asked. \"because..\" i couldn't finish my words, there was a knock on the door. yesterday i felt how Gerard stood up and locked the door. it was a night and he forgot to do it before. well. at night everyone usually lock their doors. so.. the door was locked and we heard knocks. i stood a little up, looking at him like, who did it have to be? \"Frankie baby\" and over the sound of Gerard's words asking me who it was i heard my mom's voice. \" . oh my god.\" i uttered and looked at Gerard, not knowing what to do. he was confused too. \"get dressed quickly\" he uttered. \"Frank, where are you?\" she screamed. her voice was getting nervous. mom, okay, fuck, we forgot going to school. she was so confused. i was supposed to be at school right then, oh god. i was searching for my clothes. i didn't remember where Gerard threw them last night. \"ugh Gerard\" i uttered. i used to call him \"Gerard\" for the second time and it felt really unusual. \"we forgot school\" i uttered. \"fuck\" he went pale. \"okay, you get dressed and i will lay there on the sofa, as if i am sleeping and don't know what's happening\" he uttered and ran to the sofa while putting his shirt on. i finally got dressed and ran through the door yelling \"im coming\" \"oh for god's sake Frank Iero, will you open the door?\" she uttered. i finally came to the door and opened it, hiding my hickey. i opened it. \"hey mom\" i uttered. \"ugh, Frank, how are you? are you fine? why weren't you opening the door?\" she asked me. \"ask me one please and shhh Gerard's sleeping\" i uttered. \"oh right. where's he?\" \"right there, sleeping on the sofa\" i pointed her to him. that man was mine. that man who was sleeping there. uh. i was so happy. \"okay, why weren't you opening anyway?\"she asked, whispering. \"because i.. well.. i.. i was naked mom\" i uttered. she looked at me raising her eyebrows. \"okay\" said then. i took a deep breath. \"ohhhh\" she nearly yelled. \"what's up mom\" i looked at her confused. \"Frank, school?\" she asked. she seemed to be so excited, since i was with teacher and the teacher himself forgot about going to school. lol. \"mom.. i..\" i couldn't finish. Gerard opened his eyes and looked at us. \"oh..\" he said as if he was sleeping and was so confused that my mom saw there. \"you already came?\" he stood up and looked at my mom, but then looked away and tried not to look at her again. \"you bastard\" my mom uttered. looking at me and then looking at Gerard again. \"what?\" Gerard asked afraid of her answer. \"what kind of teacher are you? you forgot to go to school\" mom complained and put the things she had in her hand on the table. i was so happy at the moment and helped her do that everything. \"thanks baby\" she uttered. but the remembered that she was angry and tried not to smile. \"im angry\" she stated. i smiled at her and looked at Gerard who was still looking down and not looking neither at me, nor at my mom. \"yeah smile now\" mom muttered. \"Frank, you haven't ate anything i left? you haven't ate anything, were you guys starving?\" she looked at us. it was such a fun to have my mom at home. i rolled my eyes and went to sit on the chair. looking at everything reminded me of last night. that window, where we, like, started everything, the chair i was sitting on, where he sat when he couldn't take that anymore. my bed. my fucking bed where it everything happened. i smiled. mom looked at me confused. i made myself serious again and looked away. \"ok i have to go\" Gerard uttered. \"yeah, go now Gerard, you didn't go to school and now you wanna go?\" mom asked. she was trying to sound serious but she couldn't. \"um Sarah.. i fell asleep im sorry\" he said. \"um.. are you okay?\" mom asked and went to him. Gerard was not okay. he was feeling guilty. mom joked and he went all serious, like, fuck. Gerard Way. it was too late for being sorry, ugh. \"yeah, don't worry\" he uttered and stood up. \"for fuck's sake Gerard\" i stated. oops. what had i just said. first of all i used a dirty word with my mother, then i called my teacher Gerard. mom looked at me confused and excited. \"what have you just said Frank Iero?\" mom uttered and looked at me like, i thought she was going to eat me alive. \"facepalm\" Gerard uttered. \"im sorry, i.. okay\" i said and sat on my chair again. \"don't use those words again and don't call your teacher with a name again\" she told me and stood up. i nodded and stood up to go to Gerard and sit next to him. \"what's up?\" i asked. \"nothing\" he muttered. \"ugh.. i don't want you to feel guilty now..\" i said and looked at him at his eyes. he looked away but i forced him to look at me. \"i don't \" he smiled and kissed on my forehead. \"you better go to school today, i will go too, i didn't have a lesson yet, you can get to school now too, it's okay to be late\" \"i don't want.. \" i uttered and made sad face expression to make him have a pity on me. \"hahah\" he laughed. \"before, i was just a teacher but now Frank.. i own you, so you have to do what i tell you\" he laughed again. \"but.. \" i started. \"Frank.. no buts\" he uttered and stood up. \"we can go together\" \"okay\" i complained for the last time but nope. i had to go to school. it was 10 AM so.. \"where are you going?\" mom asked. \"at school\" i muttered and took my bag. \"Gerard, wait \"mom called him right when we were about to open the door. \"i wanna thank you for staying with my baby yesterday\" she said and smiled to Gerard. i saw how he went uncomfortable and then smiled and looked at me with eyes full of love. \"you're welcome\" uttered and we left house. we came there as the bell rand. the lesson was over. Gerard told me that he was going to teachers' room , we were gonna have math right then, the bell, which informed us that the lesson was beginning ,rang. we waited for so long for Gerard but he didn't appear. i felt strange. he never used to be late on the lesson. i waited for him another 15 minutes. we had 2 math lessons that day. when he didn't appear, children started fighting and joking around. they were so noisy. i was there sitting when something hit my head. wasn't he going to leave school officially that day? oh god.. but he didn't need to. i thought everything changed yesterday after the things we shared. how stupid i was.. of course.. he went to school just to sign documents, why didn't he warn me? because i knew that all, i couldn't changed his mind yesterday.. after sex i hadn't asked him about it again.. yeah.. i was a dickhead. that was it. that hit me like a gun and i stood up and ran as fast as i could. everyone looked at me confused but i didn't care. i had to stop that process. when i was just to enter the teachers' room Gerard went out. i moaned at first, suddened of his action. then calmed down. \"Frank? what are you doing here?\" he asked confused. \"don't tell me that you signed that fucking contract\" i yelled. \"why are you screaming Frank?\" he asked me surprised. \"what, which contr\" but then stopped. why was he acting like he didn't know anything? \"don't act like this.. i couldn't make you stay right? you signed that fucking papers right? YOU ARE LEAVING RIGHT?\" i screamed. Gerard looked around to check that nobody was watching and went closer to make me keep silent by pressing his hand on my mouth. \"Frank...\" he smiled. he wanted to say something but then stopped and started thinking about something for a while. then said. \"yeah, i signed.\" i widened my eyes. \"what?\" asked, i was gone mad. why did he sign, was he retarded, was he alright? \"yeah..\" he looked down. i started pushing him backwards while screaming why he did so. i was super fucking mad. i couldn't imagine like, what the fuck. why did he sign, i still couldn't get. that wasn't fair. he was idiot, he was such as asshole. \"you idiot, fucking bastard, you stupid whore, you dick\" i yelled. he was smiling. yeah, he fucking was. \"you dickhead\" \"okay, stop\" he uttered. \"how can you ask me to stop?\" i asked and started pushing him again. \"Fr\" he started but i didn't let him finish by pushing him again. \"wait\" he uttered. i still didn't stop what i was doing. \"oh my god. i lied\" he half-yelled. i stopped everything and looked at him carefully. \"what?\" asked amazed. oh my god . he was a real asshole. the walking asshole. \"yeah, i didn't sign any contract, how can you even think about that since what we had yesterday?\" \"wait..\" i uttered. those words pleased me. he thought of me same as i thought of him. he was happy too, he wasn't regretting at all, but i was still angry, how could he lie? how could he say this? didn't he know that would hurt me? \"yeah. i was just getting ready for the lesson and MR Frank im sorry but you are a dickhead\" he stated and went closer to me. i tried to get away, i needed to make him think i was angry but i couldn't, i was smiling.. i couldn't make myself not to smile. he was so funny trying to pull me closer. \"you are an asshole\" i uttered while smiling. \"someone will see us\" \"they won't\" he said and pressed his lips softly on mine. i opened my mouth and let him kiss me. he gave me a very passionate kiss. that was the best moment that day at school. i kissed him back. i forgot my angryness. how could i deny it? we were kissing for some minutes but then he stopped and told me to go to class and he was going to come in some minutes. i agreed and went. \"i love you\" he uttered while i left. \"i don't\" i said and game him a face shot. \"asshole\" muttered and went. i saw from the edge of my eyes how he smiled. he was watching me walk away and go into class. i sat at my desk, pleased and happy. in some minutes he entered the classroom. school was fucking hard. Gerard stayed at school, well, he couldn't do anything else. i wouldn't let him so.. it was the only good thing that day at school. everyone were looking at me, i thought i had something bad on, or well.. they got that i had sex with Gerard. well. that was just impossible. they didn't. it was just me thinking shits. well. at maths, it was even harder. i was sitting like a student and Gerard like a teacher when in fact we were lovers and had sex. I made sure not to make too much eye contact with him in class but i knew Gerard was watching me squirm, he'd just got this little pleased smile all day. i couldn't look at him without blushing or grinning or both, so i didn't. that was hard. whenever i looked at him, i imagined him naked and kissing me and i was smiling like a stupid kid, so i preferred not to look at him and try to do something else but he was watching me, he was looking at me and smiling. see how hard it was for me to be at school that day? plus i needed to listen to him explaining maths but.. come on Frank. he wasn't the teacher you used to know before, when you were asking him for preparing you and you were ashamed of learning for free. now you could talk to him at any moment. so. that was it. i still wanted to be with him all day but i couldn't. mom would get something. the best way to be with him was telling my mom that i couldn't understand something and needed another lesson at Gerard's. yeah. the weirdest thing here was that i've never supported gays. i've said that before too. that was one moment when i thought they were lovely but it was after Gerard appeared in my life. i was so stupid. they are humans too. i wasn't talking like this because i became to be one of them. it was just that, well, i wasn't sure i was either bisexual or gay. but i'd never liked girls. that means im gay, but i'd never liked boys either. Gerard was the only one in my life .. that could mean i was bisexual. but the thing was that i didn't like when i imagined girls naked. i didn't like watching straight porn. well i was so confused. how did Gerard get what h e was? his sexuality. i needed to ask him. when school ended i felt fucking free. i went outside to search for Gerard. i couldn't find him. i thought he was already gone and became a little angry. we had just started being in a rship and it was just a beginning and i was already missing him. i had to understand that i wasn't able to see him everyday. but i wanted. i felt like i needed to see him for my day to be perfect. yeah, i was like that before too. that was why i couldn't let him go. well done Frank. if you hadn't told everything you said that night, Gerard couldn't have been so far away from you right then. for a moment, i felt proud of myself. i was positive of lying and seeing Gerard like that. it was obvious that i couldn't spend all days with him and vice versa cuz my mom would get something. i could lie to mom telling her that i didn't get anything in maths or something like that but Gerard didn't wanna do that. he hated lies. but come on. he was doing what he wasn't supposed to do, that was his biggest lie to my mom and he was opposite of telling her that i copuldn't get something? sometimes he acted like and idiot. yeah, so when i didn't see him, i decided to go alone. when i was turning aside so that school was so far away from me, i felt how someone touched me. i turned around and it was Gerard. \"oh\" i uttered, unexpecting of that. \"yeah, where where you?\" i asked him a little angry but as much as i tried to seem firmly as much as funny was i. \"umm. i didn't want anyone to see us walking together, well.. there's nothing wrong in it but in case something happens.. you get it\" he said. \"oh right\" i said. yeah. why didn't i think of that before. \"i wanna come with you\" i said. \"Frank. i want that too but you know that we can't\" \"yeah, but i can tell mom there was a difficult topic in maths and..\" \"Frank!\" he said. \"oh my fucking god. okay Gerard.\" \"don't get me wrong. it's not a good behaviour\" \"okay okay\" i uttered, a little angry of him in my heart. but he was too lovely to show him that i was angry, but i really was. \"im glad i have you\" he uttered. not knowing he said it either because he really was happy or to make me happier. i smiled anyway and answered. \"me too. you know, i could have killed myself if you didn't stay here\" \"shhh\" he made me keep silent. \"don't ever say that again\" \"i nodded. \"you know Frank.. I never thought i could have someone like you in my life. you're very special for me. you thought me to love myself.\" he said, looking at me. i was so pleased to hear it, even though i wasn't that perfect. \"i'm glad you think like that Gerard. you mean the world to me\" i uttered and hugged him. he put his right hand on my shoulders and pulled me closer and we walked like that. \"may i ask you something?\" i asked then. you couldn't even imagine how sweet was being in his arms. \"yeah\" he said. \"you know.. i don't know who i am, i don't even know im bi or gay, but im most likely gay right?\" i asked. \"Frank.. what if you are? i hope you won't hate yourself for it. it's not anything you should be ashamed of. you get it?\" he asked. \"yeah, i just wanted to know. cause i've never liked girls and you know. i wanna tell you something if you don't yell at me for that\" \"what's up?\" \"before i met you, i was like.. homophobe\" i uttered. \"uh.. that's okay boy. you are just a little boy yet. you are learning everything now. i wanna teach you everything. not only maths. i wanna tell you how you're supposed to live, how you have to live, what you should do. i will teach you everything baby\" he said and smiled to me. \"you are the best thing i've got in my life\" i uttered. he pulled me even closer this time. as if he was going somewhere and didn't wanna let me go. when it was time to get off of him, i kinda wanted to cry. i didn't wanna spend even one minute without him. yeah. when i got home, i felt really tired. i wanted to play my guitar so much. i went in. my mom wasn't alone. she was sitting at the table with our neighbour. ugh that woman. i hated her so much. she used to spread rumors about people and then talk about it with others and make others thing bad things of them. she was kinda strange woman. i didn't wanna greet her but then mom pointed me to, so i did. \"Frank, you're not going to your room yet\" mom said firmly. i was about to open my room's door when i heard her saying that. \"umm.. anything serious happened?\" i asked. \"come here\" i came to mom. i was afraid of what she was gonna say. \"bad boy\" that neighbour said and suddenly for the first time in my life i wanted to hit a woman. i rolled my eyes and asked mom what was up again. \"she will tell you\" mom said. i turned to my neighbour and she started to talk. \"you know Frank\" she said. \"yesterday i heard.. um.. okay.. well.. i heard some strange.. kinda.. strange voices from this house\" she said and there i felt my heart exploding. but still, i acted like i didn't know what she meant. \"sorry?\" i asked. \"yeah\" she repeated. \"they were like moans\" she said. fucking fuck. i told you. i told you. she was so fucking idiot. see what she did? i was very angry of her but i tried to calm down and looked at my mother with the face expression that was telling that she hurt me a little. \"now, explain\" mom said. \"come on.. for fuck's sake,\" i said. wasn't even sorry of what i said. \"are you okay Mrs. Hannah? how could those voices come from my house when we were two boys, two fucking men here?\" i asked. as if i was really confused and amazed. \"oh right,\" mom said. \"i said that too but Hannah is claiming that they came from here\" \"im sorry but no, they weren't. please the next time, you tell mom lies about me, go to the doctor and check your hearing problems\" didn't even say sorry and went straight to my room. wasn't even interested of her reaction. i was too nervous. she heard everything. i hoped mom wasn't gonna believe all, that was stupid. we were two men. she couldn't even imagine that, what Hannah said was real. i knew it. i knew that my life wasn't getting easier. opposite. it was getting harder. i had lots of problems before and plus now this. i had to hide my relationship with Gerard which didn't seem that easy. fuck. i was really confused.

Estaba desnuda y un fuerte brazo estaba alrededor de mi cintura. Mi cabeza dolía como la mierda y no recordaba nada de lo que había pasado la noche anterior. Me levanté con cuidado y mire al chico con el que probablemente o más bien había tenido sexo. \"Es bastante lindo\" pensé. Salí de la cama y busque mi ropa. Una vez ya vestida busque mi bolso y salí de la casa. Me maldije a mi misma por hacerle caso a Hailey, una de mis mejores amigas, y no traer mi auto. Despues de caminar aproximadamente la peor hora de mi vida bajo la mierda de sol, llegue al gran edificio de apartamentos donde vivo con Hailey. Entre por la gigantesca puerta de vidrio y fui directo al elevador. Una vez adentro presione el pequeño botón plateado con el número 9, el cual al presionarlo provoco que el elevador comenzara a subir. Esperaba impacientemente, escuchado la mierda de música que ponen en los elevadores, llegar a mi piso. Después de los 5 minutos mas largos de mi vida, el cubo metálico en el que me encontraba se abrió. Camine rápidamente hasta llegar a la puerta blanca con un 269 puesto en negro en la parte superior de la misma. Abrí la puerta y entre cerrando la puerta detrás de mi. No había señales de Hailey por ningún lado, asi que camine hasta la puerta de su habitación la abrí lentamente. Ella seguía dormida con su castaño cabello tapando le todo el rostro. Sonreí maliciosamente y camine hasta su cama con un vaso de agua fría en mis manos y se lo vacíe encima. -Ahhhhhhhh , eres una idiota! -grito ella mientras yo no podía parar de reírme. -Buenos días- le dije riéndome. Ella simplemente rodó los ojos de una forma bastante divertida. -¿Donde estabas te estuve llamando toda la noche?- -Por ahí - -La verdad nose para que pregunto si ya se que estabas en la cama de un hombre que no conoces- -Vaya que inteligente eres- dije con sarcasmo. -Deberías conseguir a un hombre el cual ames no ha cualquiera que esté dispuesto a acostarse contigo una noche y ya- aquí vamos de nuevo con eso. -Ya hemos hablado de eso millones de veces y sabes que yo creo que el amor es la cosa más estúpida del mundo, además no hay cosa mejor que el sexo sin sentimientos- -No se ni para que me esfuerzo en cambiar tu forma de ser- dijo Hailey rodando los ojos. Estaba apunto de decirle algo hasta que el timbre sonó. Hailey camino hacia la puerta y la abrió. Escuche la masculina voz de Harry, el novio de Hailey. -Hola _- dijo Harry sonriendo. -Hola- le dije y entre a la cocina. No me caía mal Harry sólo que a veces creo que se trae algo entre manos y si el lástima a Hailey se las verá conmigo. Era de noche de nuevo estaba alistando me para otra noche fuera de casa y entonces Hailey entró a mi habitación. -No salgas hoy y quédate con tu mejor amiga- dijo haciendo puchero. -Tengo una mejor idea sal conmigo y así no te quedas sola- -Sabes que odio salir a esos lugares llenos de personas ebrias- -Oh, vamos Hailey será divertido, además te conviene salir y dejar de quedarte aquí- -Yo si salgo- -Si solo con Harry. Vamos será divertido. - -Creo que tu y yo no tenemos la misma definición de divertido- -Tu no tienes una definición de divertido- -Si claro como digas- -¿Vas o te vas a quedar aquí abuelita?- -De acuerdo tu ganas voy contigo- -Toma- le dije dándole un vestido negro que llegan a a la mitad del muslo. -¿No crees q es muy corto?- -No abuela así que apúrate o me voy sin ti- -Que amable eres- dijo rodando los ojos. Llegamos al elegante bar donde habían varias personas ya ebrias y otras apunto de tener sexo en una mesa. Fui directo a la barra y Hailey fue detrás de mi. -Dame lo de siempre- le dije al barman, el miro Hailey y ella permaneció en silencio. -Dale a ella lo mismo, Jack- el chico asintió y nos dio un par de vasos con nuestras bebidas. Caminamos a una mesa vacía donde tomamos asiento. -Creo que le gustas- -Tengo novio- -Si claro Harry- dije rodando los ojos. -Su nombre es Jack Gilinsky por si lo quieres saber- estaba creando un plan en mi mente de como hacer que Hailey se olvidará un poco de Harry y saliera con Jack, hasta que un chico alto rubio entró entró al bar tenía unas hermosos ojos azules que se podían ver a kilómetros de distancia y en sus rosados labios había una pequeña y pervertida sonrisa. Mordí mi labio al ver sus brazos marcados por pequeños aunque visibles músculos. -Cuidado se te sale la lengua- dijo Hailey despertando me de mi sueño. Rodé los ojos y sin decir nada me levante de mi asiento y camine hacia la barra donde estas el chico rubio. -Jack dame otro por favor- Note como los ojos azules del chico me veían de pies a cabeza. -¿Te gusta lo que ves?- -Si- dijo de la forma más relajada posible. \"Hora de poner mi plan en marcha\" pensé. Di media vuelta y empecé a caminar a la mesa, donde se encontraba Hailey hasta que la mano del chico tomó mi brazo y halo de el acercándome más. -Soy Niall- -Espero que seas soltera- dijo sonriendo pervertidamente. -Lo soy- dije devolviendo le la misma sonrisa. -Me alegra escucharlo ¿Sabes? Mi apartamento no queda muy lejos de aquí- -¿Eso es una invitación?- -Talvez- -Bien entonces que hacemos aquí-[Chapter 2] Advertencia: Este capítulo puede contener escenas fuertes si no te gustan este tipo de cosas te recomiendo que no leas esta parte. Una ves en el apartamento de Niall. El comenzó a besarme salvajemente mientras caminábamos a, lo que yo suponía, era su habitación. Sentí como caía en la cama mientras Niall seguía con sus salvajes besos. El comenzó a bajar hasta mi cuello, lo cual hiso que pequeños gemidos se escaparan de mi boca. Niall comenzó a bajar mi vestido y luego mi ropa interior. Yo comencé a sacar su camisa y luego su pantalón, dejándolo sólo es boxers. Mis manos paseaban por su pecho mientras seguía besándome. Baje mi mano hasta su miembro, lo cual hiso gemir a Niall. Baje su boxer y mordí mi labio al ver lo que tenia ahí abajo. Niall se alejó de mi y abrió uno de los gabinetes ubicados cerca de la cama. Sacó un pequeño paquete plateado y lo abrió. Se colocó encima de mi y comenzó a entrar lentamente. Una pequeño jadeo se escapó de nuestras bocas. El seguí con sus lentos movimientos dentro y fuera de mi. Luego de unos minutos Niall comenzó con movimientos más rápidos hasta llegar al clímax prácticamente al mismo tiempo. -Aún no hemos terminado- dijo Niall sonriendo pícaro. A la mañana siguiente desperté sola en la cama de Niall. Cuando me levante no encontraba mi ropa así que salí de la habitación sin nada puesto. Camine hacia cocina del lujoso apartamento en el que Niall vive. Cuando llegue vi a Niall preparando al de desayuno. El noto mi presencia y gira su cabeza a mi dirección. Mira todo mi cuerpo y sonrió pícaro. -Creo que no encontraste tu ropa- dijo Niall. Rodé los ojos. -Tu que crees- -Bueno lo siento pero estaba sucia así que se esta lavando- - Gracias supongo- El seguía mirándome y eso por alguna extraña razón me ponia nerviosa. -¿Podrías dejar de mirarme?- -Si no estuvieras desnuda en frente de mi tal vez- -Si tuviera mi ropa no estaría desnuda- -De todos modos tengo mejor vista de esta manera- dijo sin quitar la vista de mi cuerpo. Dios eso me hiso sonrojar ¿porque me estoy sonrojando? ¿que me pasa? Necesito salir de aquí. -¿Me puedes dar mi ropa? Debo irme- -Yo te llevo si quieres- -NO..digo no tranquilo yo me puedo ir sola- Dios que pasa conmigo ¿porque estoy nerviosa y porque me sonrojo? Llegue al apartamento y no vi Hailey así fui a su habitación cuando abrí la puerta note que había ropa en el piso y Hailey no estaba sola en la cama, estaba con un hombre y no era Harry. -Oh dios...- Vota, comenta y sigueme![Chapter 3] Narra Niall Estaba en casa sólo y completamente aburrido. Pensé en salir a algún bar pero sinceramente era demasiado temprano como para salir a emborracharme. Seguía pensando en que hacer hoy hasta que escuche el sonido de un teléfono y definitivamente no era el mío. Busque de donde venía la pequeña melodía hasta que encontré el teléfono, el cual probablemente era de , pude ver en la pantalla el nombre \" WHITNEY\" conteste el teléfono sin pensarlo dos veces. -Umm...¿Hola? - -Hola ¿Quien eres? - -Soy Niall - -¿Y que hace con el teléfono de _?- -Ella lo dejo en mi casa- -De acuerdo gracias ¿Niall cierto?- -Si- -Ok gracias adiós- -Adiós- y dicho eso colgué la llamada. Narra _ Estaba demasiado impactada por lo que tenia en frente mío. ¡Por Dios! Hailey estaba durmiendo con otro hombre. Pensé en tomar le una foto a este momento histórico así busque mi teléfono dentro de mi bolso. -Dios ¿donde esta?- susurre Escuche como el sonido del teléfono de Hailey sonaba por la habitación y como ella empezaba a despertar. Abrió los ojos y los abrió como platos al ver quien estaba con ella en la cama. -Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh- grito o más bien chillo Hailey, lo cual hiso a Jack caer de la cama. -¿Pero que?- se quejo Jack Dios esto no era nada bueno. -¿Que haces aquí? - dijo Hailey al borde de un ataque de pánico Yo camine lentamente hacia el teléfono, que aún sonaba, como si nada estuviera pasando entre Hailey y Jack. -¿Hola? - -Si ¿que pasa?- -Llame a tu teléfono pero un tal Niall me contesto- -Oh, si Niall sólo es un chico cualquiera- -Si como sea recuerda que hoy deben ir a recoger me al aeropuerto- -Espera ¿que? ¿acaso no volvías el domingo? - -¡, hoy es domingo! - -¿Enserio?- -Si. Dios te juro que si no llamo me quedo viviendo en el aeropuerto- -Deja de exagerar yo si me acordaba de que venias hoy solo te estaba molestando- -Si claro- -Cómo sea debo irme hay un asunto que debo arreglar- -Luego me cuentas todo- -De acuerdo. Como hubiera deseado haber tomado una foto- -Mmmm ok? Nos vemos luego adiós- -Adiós - Deje el teléfono donde estaba y volví a dirigir mi atención hacia Hailey, quien abrazaba sus piernas y pequeñas lágrimas salían de sus ojos. Por lo menos Jack ya se había ido. Creo que me perdí de toda la acción mierda. -Hailey no llores- -¿Cómo quieres que no lo haga? acabo de engañar a mi novio- -Oh vamos se que te sientes mal pero...-Dios necesito decirle la verdad. -¿Pero que? Harry es lindo y tierno conmigo y que hago yo me acuesto con un chico que conocí en un bar- vamos _ sólo dile la verdad. -Hailey tengo algo que decirte- - ¿Que?- -Harry no es la persona que tu piensas- -¿Porque dices eso?- -Porque Harry te engañó- -¿Que? Pero ¿con quien? Eso es imposible Harry no es así ¿Tienes pruebas o algo? - -No pero Harry siempre ha sido el tipo mujeriego y créeme esas personas no cambian de la noche a la mañana. Se que quieres mucho a Harry pero ¿no crees que ya es hora de que se den un tiempo? Sabes que no soy buena con estas cosas del amor pero creo que debes conocer a otras personas y olvidarte un poco de Harry- -No lo sé necesito un tiempo para que toda mi mente se aclare- Necesitaba recuperar mi teléfono así que después de hablar con Hailey decidí conducir al apartamento de Niall. Una ves dentro del lujoso edificio me acerqué a uno, de lo que yo suponía, trabajaba ahí. -Hola. Disculpe ¿sabe cual es el apartamento de Niall?- -¿Niall que?- dijo el anciano hombre detrás del escritorio. -Mmmm...no lose ¿cuantos Nialls puede haber aquí? - -Hay 5- ¿QUE? 5 esto tiene que ser una broma. -¿No tiene una foto de cada uno?- -No- Dios que señor más amargado. -¿Tiene un teléfono al cual pueda llamar?- -No- este definitivamente iba a ser un largo día.[Chapter 4] -Mire señor necesito ver a Niall en este momento- -¿Cual es su apellido?- -Ya le dije que no lo se- este señor estaba empezando a estresarme y eso no era bueno. ¿Porque no recuerdo el maldito número de habitación? Debo poner mas atención. - Talvez puede describir como luce el señor Niall- -Si es rubio, alto y de ojos azules- -Claro Niall Horan habitación 300 piso 10- -Gracias supongo - susurre. -Y una cosa más señorita el elevador esta fuera de servicio- mis ojos se abrieron como platos. Esto tiene que ser una puta broma. Después de subir la mierda de escaleras ya que el puto elevador estaba fuera de servicio llegue al bendito piso diez. Busque la puta puerta con el puto numerito hasta que la encontré. Toque el pequeño botón al lado de la puerta el cual hiso un pequeño sonido. Minutos después apareció Niall usando nada mas que boxers mi mirada se desvío al bulto que había bajo los boxers. -Hola- dijo Niall. -Hola así que así es como recibes a tus visitas- le dije -Algo asi dijo- dijo riendo. Tenia una linda risa. Dios _ concéntrate. -Vine por mi teléfono- -Oh si- dijo buscando el teléfono con la mirada- aquí esta- -Gracias- dije sonriendo- bueno ya me voy gracias otra ves- -Espera ¿tienes algo que hacer?-dijo sonriendo picaramente. -No creo que no- -Entonces puedes quedarte ya sabes a hacer cosas -Supongo que no tendría ningún inconveniente con eso- Sin decir más Niall se acercó a mi y comenzó a besarme apasionadamente. Caminamos hasta su habitación y el me dejo caer en la cama y comenzó a quitarme la ropa. Comenzó a besarme mi cuello hasta bajar a mis pechos, los cuales beso, siguió con su camino de besos hasta mi vientre, para luego volver a subir a mi pechos. Mi respiración era agitada al igual que la de Niall. Sentí como Niall volvió a bajar dejando pequeños besos por todo mi cuerpo hasta llegar a mi feminidad la cual besó dulcemente provocando que empezara a gemir. Niall se detuvo y empezó a abrir otro pequeño paquete de aluminio para después colocarse el condón. Comenzó a entrar en mi está vez con embestidas más fuertes rápidas provocando que nuestros fuertes gemidos se escucharán por toda la habitación. Después de irme del apartamento de Niall, la mañana siguiente, note el hecho de que mi teléfono tenía rota toda la pantalla y para empeorar la situación olvide ir a recoger a Whitney al aeropuerto. -Ya te dije que lo siento- le dije a Whitney por milésima ves. Ella simplemente rodó los ojos. - Lo siento ¿cuantas veces más tengo que decirlo?- -Hasta que yo diga- -Lamento haberte dejado en aeropuerto pero todo paso muy rápido y si te hace sentir mejor mi teléfono esta roto- -Me hace sentir sólo un poco mejor- dijo rodando los ojos. Después de tratar disculparme con Whitney un millón de veces más. Decidí ir a trabajar, si asi es trabajaba ya que con esto ganaba lo suficiente para sobrevivir e ir a la universidad con mi beca, con Hailey en nuestra cafetería favorita, Starbucks. -¿Está muy enojada? - dijo Hailey cuando me vio entrar en el pequeño local lleno de personas. -Sólo un poco supongo- -Casi me ahorca cuando llego al apartamento, ya que el aeropuerto queda muy lejos y tuvo que pagar mucho para llegar en taxi- -Lo siento pero ¿no pudiste llevarla tu?- -Te llevaste el auto Einstein- -Bueno lo siento- -Cómo sea mejor empecemos a trabajar- asentí y me coloque en mi puesto. -Buenas, bienvenido a Starbucks ¿que desea ordenar? - dije y levante mi mirada y vi al chico parado frente a mi tenía ojos azules y cabello castaño y sonreía mostrando sus dientes. No voy a mentir era muy lindo. -Sólo quiero un café normal, por favor- dijo con un pequeño acento inglés en su voz. -Claro. Mmm...serían dos dólares- el chico asintió y sacó dos dólares de su billetera. -¿Me podría dar su nombre?- -Claro soy Louis, Louis Tomlinson- asentí y le sonreí. -¿Sólo eso desea señor Tomlinson?- el solo asintió- bien puede ir a sentarse su orden llegará en un minuto- -Gracias- dijo y fue a una mesa. Después de un día largo y aburrido por fin fuimos a casa y también depues de tratar de llamar la atención de Louis descubrí que es de esos chicos que creen en el amor y no en las aventuras de una noche. -Así que _ ¿donde estuviste ayer?-dijeron Hailey y Whitney al mismo tiempo. -Yo estaba en ammm...- no quería decir la verdad porque sabía que si lo hacía ellas harían preguntas como ¿te gusta? ¿por fin dejarás tus aventuras? ¿estás enamorada de él? - en casa de la abuela- -¿Casa de la abuela? ¿Podrías inventar una peor escusa? Tu abuela vive en Londres y estamos en Nueva York- -De acuerdo yo estaba en...trabajando horas extra- -¿Enserio? Tu _ trabajando horas extra- -Si soy alguien aplicada- ellas sólo rodaron los ojos.[Chapter 5] -Alguien tan aplicada que es casi despedida por llegar tarde casi...digo todos los días al trabajo- dijo Hailey cruzada de brazos. - Quería recompensar todos mis tardías- -Si claro- -Bien ya estuve con alguien- -¿Enserio me dejaste en el aeropuerto por estar con un completo desconocido?- dijo Whitney -No era un desconocido- ambas abrieron los ojos como platos. Mierda pensé.¿Que carajos acabo de decir? -Espera¿lo hiciste por segunda vez con alguien?- -¿Que?...pff...¿de donde sacaste eso?- ambas sólo me miraron fulminantes -de acuerdo si ya lo hice pero antes de que empiecen con sus estúpidas preguntas. No, no me gusta y no es mi novio- -¿Con quien?- dijo Hailey -El chico del bar- -¿Cual chico del bar?- pregunto Whitney -El que tenia mi teléfono- -¿Y no te gusta? - -No, fue solo sexo y ya- A la mañana siguiente desperté e hice mi rutina de todos los días y fui al trabajo. Era un día normal hasta que vi a un rubio de ojos azules, Niall, con una chica de cabello castaño casi rubio y ojos verdes. La sangre me hervía de cel...espera ¿que? Niall camino hasta donde yo estaba y cuando me vio sonrió. - ¿_? ¿Trabajas aquí? - -No sólo adoro ponerme este uniforme y pararme como idiota atendiendo a personas que quieren café- dije sarcástica. -De acuerdo- dijo riendo se. Que linda sonri..._concéntrate. - ¿Podrías darme dos cafés mocha?- -Si claro ¿solamente? - -Si...no espera también un sexy baile tuyo para la mesa cinco- dijo mientras sonreía pícaro. -Que buena idea así puedo agregar a mi curriculum prostitución- dije mientras el se reía. -¿Niall porque tardas tanto?- dijo la chica con la que Niall venía. -Estoy ahí en un segundo- dijo serio. Baje mi mirada hacia la pantalla donde apuntaba las ordenes y espere a que señorita \"plastica\" se fuera. -Serían serían 4 dólares- dije sin ninguna expresión en mi rostro. Niall asintió y sacó su tarjeta y me la entrego - su orden estará lista en un segundo señor Horan- -Gracias- dijo y se fue. Rodé mis ojos y mire a la mesa donde estaba el. La chica con la que estaba sonreía animadamente al igual que el. -¡_!- dijo Hailey. -¿Que?- -¿Que si ya esta lista la orden de la mesa que has estado mirando?- -Si pero yo les llevó la orden- -¿Segura?- -Si- dicho eso toma los cafés y camine hasta la mesa. - Aquí esta su orden- Niall me miró y sonrió levemente. -Gracias - dijo la chica bajando la cabeza. -¿Desean algo más? - -Si mi baile sexy- susurro Niall. Rodó los ojos e ignore su comentario. -Estamos bien-dijo la castaña asentí y me fui de la mesa. -¿Que fue todo eso?- pregunto Hailey. -Eso no fue...- -El es el chico del bar ¿cierto?- me interrumpió. -Si pero no es lo que crees- ella sonreía pícara y yo solo rodé los ojos. Por fin el día había terminado y ya podría volver a casa. -_ necesito que me des el auto Harry y yo nos vamos a ver en un lugar- -Espera ¿Harry? ¿Que no habías terminado con el?- -Larga historia como sea ¿me das el auto?- -¿Y como voy a casa?- -Coquetea con algún chico para que te lleve por favor necesito el auto- -Bien puedes llevártelo pero me debes una- -Gracias te quiero amiga- -Si si si yo también ahora vete antes de que me arrepienta- ella sonrió y se fue. Recogí mis cosas y salí del pequeño local. -Hola - dijo una voz conocida. -Hola Niall- -Creo que necesitas que alguien te lleve a casa- -No, estoy bien- -Oh, vamos _ yo te puedo llevar además a esta hora hay muchos locos por aqui- -Dijo que no- -No te voy a violar- -Lo dice el que quería un baile sexy- -No es mi culpa que seas tan linda y me provoques- -Eres un pervertido- -No lo soy- -Igual no me voy a ir contigo- -Por favor hay muchos locos aquí y que ¿te vas a ir con ellos?- -Si- -¿Y si uno es un asesino violador?- -Pues me voy con el- -Ven conmigo prometo comportarme- dijo haciendo cara de perrito abandonado. -Bien me voy contigo pero no hagas nada pervertido- dije y el sonrió. Después de darle la dirección a Niall sobre como llegar a mi apartamento llegamos al gran edificio. -¿Puedo entrar contigo?- dijo Niall -No- -Sólo será un momento- -¿Para que vas a entrar?- -Quiero ver donde vives- -¿Para?- -No lose sólo quiero y ya- -No vas a entrar- -Por favor, además puedr ser que tengamos algo de diversión- -Ni creas que yo me voy a volver a acostar contigo- -Yo se que deseas volver a hacerlo- -Si solo en tus sueños, Horan- -¿Porque no vamos adentro y lo comprobamos?- -No vas a entrar- -Osea que tienes miedo de que tus impulsos te ganen- -Yo no lo tengo miedo a nada- -Entonces ¿porque no quieres que vaya allá arriba contigo?- -¿Sabes que? Bien tu ganas puedes subir- le dije y el sonrió pícaro. Entramos al edificio y caminamos al elevador, marque el botón con el número 9, el cual me llevo a mi piso. Caminamos a la puerta de mi apartamento y la abrí. Entre y luego Niall. En un rápido movimiento Niall me atrapó contra la pared poniendo sus brazo a mis lados y rozó sus labios en mi cuello y luego plantó un pequeño en este, luego llegó a mis labios y los beso apasionadamente, no pude evitarlo y me deje llevar por los movimientos de nuestros labios. Niall se separó y me miró con esos ojos azules tan perfec...cállate _. -Creo que tus impulsos ganan- susurro en mi oído a lo que yo rodé los ojos.[Chapter 6] Empujé a Niall alejando lo de mi y camine a la cocina. Busque una cerveza en el refrigerador y la saque. Camine hacia el sofá y me senté en este y luego Niall se sentó junto a mi. Tome el control de la televisión y comencé a pasar canales. Sentía la mirada de Niall justo en mi pero decidí ignorarlo. De un pronto a otro Niall quita la cerveza de mis manos. -¡Hey dame eso!- le dije mientras el tomaba un trago-¡No, la vas a contaminar!- dije mientras me abalanzaba sobre el. Después de varias intentos por tomar la botella y cuando finalmente lo logre note que ya estaba vacía. Mire fulminante a Niall mientras que el sonreía pícaro no entendía porque hasta que me di cuenta en la posición en la que estábamos, yo estaba sobre su regazo y el tenía las manos sobre mis muslos. Trate de safarme de su agarre pero el era mas fuerte que yo y empezó a subir sus manos hasta mi trasero pegando más a él. Mis labios estaban muy cerca de los suyos y podía sentir su respiración en mi rostro. El sonido de la puerta abriéndose de golpe me hiso sobresaltar diriji mi mirada a la puerta y vi a Whitney con los ojos bien abiertos viéndome. Me levanté rápidamente y camine hacia ella. -¿Whitney, que haces aquí no se supone que te quedaría en tu casa?- le pregunte tratando de sonar normal. -Si pero estaba aburrida y decidí venir- -¿Y no se te ocurrió preguntar?- -No- -Hola soy Niall creo que ya nos conocemos- dijo el colocando una mano en mi cintura. Whitney frunció el seño. -hablamos por teléfono la vez que _ dejo su teléfono en mi casa- Whitney asintió y luego me miró pícara. -Oh cierto...espera entonces es oficial- esta vez yo fruncí el seño. -¿Que?- -¿Qué si ya son novios?- mis ojos se abrieron como platos al escuchar eso mientras que Niall río un poco. -¡No! ¿Te volviste loca? ¿Estas drogada?- le dije a Whitney. -No es sólo que nunca te había visto tanto con un chico- -No estoy saliendo con el nisiquiera lo invente a venir y es mas ya se iba- dije tomando la mano de Niall hasta llevarlo fuera del apartamento pero el se detuvo a la mitad de la puerta. -Me iré con una condición- dijo conectando nuestras miradas. -¿Cual?- -Esta- dijo el y me besó. Me quede inmóvil no me esperaba esto. El comenzó a profundizar el beso usando su lengua. Tenia que ser sincera el besaba increíblemente bien. El se separó de mi y me sonrió. -Te veo luego- dijo y me guiño un ojo. Me quede ahí de pie en la puerta sin decir nada. Mire a Whitney ella trataba de aguantar su risa la mire sería y cerré la puerta. -Ni una palabra de esto- le dije y camine a la cocina. -Dios muero de hambre- dije para mi misma. -Es obvio ya que tu cena se fue- Mire a Whitney fulminante y ella empezó a reir -lo siento pero ya era mi hora de molestarte un poco- rodé los ojos y busque algo de comer. Mierda no había nada. Genial Hailey había olvidado comprar la comida de nuevo...¿o me tocaba a mi? -¿Pedimos pizza?- -Eso no se pregunta- dijo Whitney sonriendo. Después de pedir la pizza nos sentamos en el sofá a esperar la mientras veíamos televisión. Escuche golpes en la puerta y me levante y fui hasta está. La abrí y vi a un chico de cabello castaño claro y ojos marrones. Era muy lindo. Le sonreí y el me devolvió el gesto. -Whit ¿tienes dinero no encuentro mi bolso?- -Si aquí...¿Liam?- -¡Whitney! - dije el y luego abrazó a mi amiga. No entendía nada de lo que pasaba. -¿Ustedes se conocen?- -Si conocí a Liam la primera semana de mi viaje el me ayudó a no perderme- -No tenia idea de que vivías aquí- -Bueno no vivo aquí en este edificio pero vivo algo cerca- -Eso es increíble sabes sólo porque ustedes son increíblemente lindas les daré la pizza gratis- dijo sonriendo nos. -Gracias eso es muy amable de tu parte Liam- dijo Whitney. -No hay de que pero...- dijo sacando un papel y escribiendo algo en el- aquí tienes mi número por si quieres que no veamos alguna vez- dijo Liam dándome el papel. -Gracias- dijo mordiendo mi labio. -Bueno debo irme adiós Whit adiós...- -Adiós _- Dicho eso el se fue. -No puedo creer que te diera su número ¿como lo haces?- -¿Qué cosa?- -Conseguir chicos tan fácilmente- -No lo sé-[Chapter 7] Narra Niall Me encontraba en la cama de mi apartamento con _ desnuda junto a mi, ella dormía tranquilamente con una de sus manos en mi pecho. Yo la admiraba dormir ella era increíblemente hermosa no podía de dejar de verla deseaba poder quedarme así para siempre con ella. Suspire pesadamente ya había pasado un mes todo un maldito mes de que la conocí a ella, nunca había pasado tanto tiempo sin acostarme con otras chicas y si era cierto durante todo el mes con la única que estuve fue _. A veces era gracioso pensar todas las veces que ella me dijo que sería la última vez que tendríamos sexo y dos segundos después ya lo estábamos haciendo. Cada día que pasaba quería más de ella, quería sentir su cuerpo junto al mio y besar sus perfectos labios tenía que admitirlo ella llenaba una pequeña parte de mi que siempre estuvo vacía y eso me hacía sentir tan diferente era una sensación pero no no era amor no Niall Horan no se enamora...o eso creo. Suspire de nuevo ¿Que mierda me estaba haciendo ella? ¿Porque con ella todo se sentía tan diferente? Pase una mano por mi cabello estaba muy confundido no tenia idea de lo que estaba sintiendo en este momento. Trate de alejar todo de mi mente y dormir un poco pero era imposible más si su cuerpo estaba tan pegado al mio eso me distraía aún más. Mierda porque era tan difícil y diferente con ella ¿Acaso ella no era simplemente una chica más? Si si lo era pero...la única diferencia era que llevaba un mes con ella. Mierda, mierda y más mierda no puedo enamorarme yo no me enamoro eso solo es para tontos es mas eso nisiquiera debería pasar por mi mente. Después de varias horas finalmente pude dormir pero cuando desperté _ ya se había ido, aunque me hubiera gustado despertar con ella a mi lado talvez el que ella se fuera era lo mejor sobre todo por todos mis confusos pensamientos sobre ella. Al levantarme tome una ducha y fui a trabajar. Fue una mañana algo agotadora estaba realmente cansado y necesitaba un café. De repente un gran idea de donde podría conseguir un muy buen café llegó a mi mente y sonreí picaro. Narra _ Me encontraba en ese pequeño lugar de café en el trabajaba completamente aburrida, ya hoy no había muchas personas. Estaba parada detrás del mostrador mirando mi celular hasta que la sombra de alguien me tapó la luz. Levante mi mirada encontrándome con una mirada azul y un Niall vestido algo formal. -Hola Niall- le dije apartando mi mirada -¿Que haces aquí?- -¿Que acaso no puedo venir por un cafe?- asentí no muy segura ya que no parecía que tomar un café fuera su única intención. -Bien entonces ¿que quieres tomar?- -A ti- dijo sonriendo perversamente - ya sabes podemos salir por ahí - -Lo siento pero ni aunque quisiera me iría contigo- -No quería tener que llegar a esto pero si no es por la buenas es por las malas- levante una ceja sin entender a la que se refería hasta que lo vi saltar el mostrador para luego tomarme de la cintura y levantarme sobre su hombro. Vi como el empezó a caminar hacia la salida. -Sueltame Niall eres un idiota- le grite mientras le daba golpes en la espalda. Varias personas nos veían pero no me importaba todo lo que quería era que el me soltará. Vi como salíamos del local de café y luego sentí como me sentaba en el asiento de un auto para que luego Niall cerrará la puerta y pusiera el seguro para niños asegurándose de que yo no me pudiera ir en lo que el daba la vuelta para subirse del lado del conductor. Niall encendió el auto y me miró a lo que yo me cruce de brazos e ignore su mirada y el rió un poco. Después unos minutos de silencio Niall habló. -¿Así que no dirás nada durante todo el camino?- me dijo pero yo no le respondí. -Bien como quieras- Después de un tiempo de conducir el se bajo del auto. Vi como caminaba alejándose un poco para que luego se sentara en el suelo. Suspire y me baje del auto y camine hacia él y senté en el suelo algo cerca. Mire hacia el frente y vi la hermosa vista que tenia este lugar se podía ver partes de la cuidad y así como una increíble puesta de sol. Sonreí ligeramente y coloque mi cabeza en el hombro de Niall. -Es lindo ¿no?- me pregunto él. -Si mucho- le respondí pero derrepente pensé ?porque el me había traído aquí? yo no era su novia ni nada suyo como para que el hiso era cosas lindas por mi- Niall- lo llame. -¿Mmm?- -¿Porque me trajiste aquí? Osea es lindo y todo pero no lo se talvez no sea un lugar para dos personas que ya sabes sólo tienen sexo puedan venir así porque si- el permaneció en silencio mirándome. Después unos minutos el abrió la boca para hablar pero en lugar de eso se acercó a mi y me besó. Sentí este beso diferente no había nada de lujuria en el solamente era un besó con algo de ¿ternura? Aún seguíamos besándonos sólo que ahora el beso tenía algo más de profundidad lo cual hacia que el ambiente fuera más caliente. Sin pensarlo dos veces Niall me levanto y comenzó a caminar al auto entramos en el. Una vez adentro Niall comenzó a besar mi cuello. Hasta que una voz no interrumpió. -ESTO ES PROPIEDAD PRIVADA SALGAN DE AQUÍ AHORA- sonó la voz de alguien a través de un megáfono. Niall se separó rápidamente de mi y luego se paso al asiento del conductor, encendió el auto y salimos del lugar. Luego de unos minutos de silencio ambos empezamos a reir. -Casi nos descubren- dijo Niall sin poder parar de reír. -Lose por lo menos no habíamos avanzado mucho- dije -Bueno si quieres podemos terminar lo que empezamos- dijo guiñando un ojo. -No lo creo Horan mejor llévame a mi casa- -Oh, vamos estuvimos apunto de hacerlo hace poco y ahora ¿me estas rechazando?- -Si, lo que pasó fue un error y no volverá a suceder- -Lo que pasó fue un error y no volverá a suceder- dijo el imitando mi voz- siempre dices eso- -Pero esta vez es encerio- -Si claro ya hemos hecho esto durante un mes ¿que te hace pensar que va a ser diferente?- -Qué yo ya no quiero nada contigo- -¿Asi?- -Si- -Bien- -Bien- rodé los ojos estaba muy enojada lo único que quería era llegar a casa y dejar de ver su estúpida cara. Note que nos desviamos del camino a mi casa. -Te dije que quería ir a casa- le dije entre dientes. -Ya lo se- respondió con tranquilidad. -Entonces ¿A donde mierda me llevas?- -A mi casa- -¿QUE?- -A mi casa- -¿Acaso vas a secuestrar me y violarme?- -No, hermosa no es violación si las dos personas lo quieren-[Chapter 8] Rodé los ojos. Como lo odiaba el era tan...tan...bipolar si bipolar eso era el. En un momento podría ser algo tierno y al otro ser un completo idiota. Ahora lo peor de todo era que me llevaba a su casa. ¿Porque mierda ese día fui a ese club? ¿Porque no fui a otro habiendo tantos en bares en toda la cuidad? Mierda. Quería ir a mi casa de una maldita vez. Suspire y gire mi cabeza hacia el, mire su perfil. Parecía relajado tenía ambas manos sobre el volante y la miraba fijamente en el camino. Sus finos labios no mostraban ninguna expresión. Su ropa estaba ligeramente arrugada y su pantalón aún no estaba totalmente abrochado. Una traviesa sonrisa se escapo de mis labios al recordar lo que hacíamos minutos atrás, pero preferí ignorarlo ya que se supone que estaba enojada con el así que me puse sería. Aunque aún sin dejar de mirarlo. El sonido de su teléfono me despertó de mi transe y entonce note que me había quedado un gran rato viéndolo rápidamente desvíe la mirada hacia la ventana, mientras el buscaba su teléfono en sus bolsillos. -¿Hola?- escuche como decía respondiendo la llamada- ahora estoy ocupado ¿podría ser en otro momento?- dijo con cierta molestia- si yo se pero...- se quedo callado un momento- bien iré, estoy haya en 20 minutos- dijo entre dientes- es eso o no voy, adiós- dicho eso colgó la llamada. Me quede en silencio mientras el apretaba con fuerza el volante al parecer esa llamada lo había molestado bastante . Después de los 20 minutos mas largos de mi vida finalmente llegamos a lo que parecía un gran edificio de oficinas. -Escucha no me importa lo que vayas a hacer pero tienes dos opciones la primera, vas caminando a tu casa sola y la otra, te quedas conmigo es tu eleccion- dicho eso se bajo del auto y cerró la puerta con fuerza. Me quede un segundo pensando mis opciones en la primera podría ir a mi casa pero el problema era que ya era de noche y no sabia donde estaba así que tal vez esta no era la mejor opción. También podría quedarme con el pero eso era lo que el quería y yo no iba a satisfacerlo. Aunque si escogiera la primera opción tendrá que caminar quien sabe cuanto y además era sumamente peligroso. Suspire rendida. Supongo que tendré que ir con el. Baje del auto y corrí para llegar detrás de él. Llegamos a unas gigantescas puertas de vidrio. Niall abrió una pasando antes que yo y dejando la puerta caer literalmente en mi cara. Ahora a este que le pasaba pensé. Rodé los ojos y acelere mi paso para alcanzarlo nuevamente, no quería perderme. Llegamos al elevador. Una vez dentro Niall presiono uno de botones. Permaneció en silencio. En ese momento recorde que Niall aun no habia arreglado su ropa y reí ligeramente. El me miro con el ceño fruncido sin entender la razón de mi risa. -¿De que tanto te ríes?- pregunto algo molesto. -Tu ropa- mencione soltando una carcajada. El miro su ropa aun sin entender hasta que se dio cuenta que su pantalón estaba desabrochado y su camisa arruga y mal abotonada. Con una sonrisa algo traviesa se acomodo su ropa justo en el momento en el que las puertas del elevador se abrieron. Salimos de este y caminamos hacia un mostrador donde una chica de cabello rubio se encontraba sentada. Ella le sonrió y le guiño un ojo a Niall, a lo que el respondió de la misma manera. Rodé los ojos ella tenia cara de puta probablemente habia tenido sexo con Niall. -Lo que necesita firmar esta en su oficina señor Horan- dijo lo que parecia la secretaria de Niall. Ya había pasado toda una maldita hora y yo moría de aburrimiento. Niall no había hecho más que firmar papeles y no me había dirigido la mirada nisiquiera me había dicho algo. Así que me levante del pequeño sofá en el que me encontraba y camine hacia Niall. Me acerqué a su escritorio y quite el lapicero, con el que escribía en unos papeles. -¡Hey! Dame eso lo necesito- protestó. -Estoy aburrida- dije haciendo puchero. Niall se quedó en silencio por un momento hasta que se levantó de su silla y comenzó a acercarse a mi peligrosamente. -¿Estas aburrida? Yo tengo una manera de quitar el aburrimiento- dijo mientras caminaba acercándose cada vez más mientras yo retrocedía. Hasta que choque con la pared. Niall me encerró entre sus brazos evitando que me moviera. Sus labios se encontraban muy cerca de los míos, podía sentir su respiración chocar con la mía. -¿Quieres saber cual es mi método para quitar el aburrimiento?- dijo. Mi mirada se desvío a sus labios y unas gigantescas ganas de besarlo aparecieron. Me rendí y lo bese. El tardó un rato en corresponderlo sorprendido por mi acción. Rápidamente el beso tomó más profundidad mientras nuestras lenguas chocaban. Niall me levanto y camino hacia el escritorio sentando me en el, aun sin romper el beso. Sus manos comenzaron a pasar debajo de mi blusa, acariciando mi piel. Segundos después quito mi blusa dejándo mi parte superior nada mas en sostén. Estaba apunto de quitar este cuando alguien abrió la puerta fuertemente. -Niall necesi...- dijo una voz masculina algo conocida. Ya que me encontraba a espaldas de la puerta no podía ver quien era. -Maldita sea, Harry, ¿Acaso no sabes tocar?- dijo Niall. Esperen ¿Harry?. -¿Tu acaso no sabes ponerle seguro a las puertas?- Niall rodó los ojos. -Cómo sea ¿Que mierda quieres?- -¿Recuerdas el proyecto que no pudimos sacar por falta de fondos?- -Si ¿Que con eso?- -Bueno después de hacer una par de llamadas logre conseguir el dinero- -¿Hablas enserio? Eso es increíble- -Lose, ¿Entonces talvez no fue tan mala mi interrupción?- -Si lo fue- -Cómo digas Horan te veo luego- dicho eso salió de la oficina. Tenia curiosidad de saber si era el Harry que yo conocía aunque no lo creía mucho nunca vi a alguien como el trabajando en un lugar así. -¿Podemos seguir?- dijo Niall sacándome de mi pensamientos. Me quede en silencio. -te daré la mejor noche de toda tu vida- susurro sobre mis labios -espero que resistas toda la noche- murmuró depositando un beso en mis labios.[Chapter 9] Su rostro se encontraba muy cerca del mio y mi respiración se empezaba a agitar. Seguí sin decir una sola palabra. -Tomare tu silencio como un \"Si Niall puedes continuar\"- dijo fingiendo mi voz. -¡Hey! Yo no hablo asi- dije riendo y dándole un ligero golpe en el hombro. -Claro que si ¿Acaso no te has escuchado?- rodé los ojos. -Idiota- murmure. -¿Que dijiste?- dijo fulminado me con la mirada. -Nada- dije riendo ligeramente. -Eso pense- sonrió pícaro y empezó a besar mi cuello, probablemente dejando marcas. Sus manos vagaban por mi espalda produciendo escalofríos en mi cuerpo. Quitó mi sostén con rapidez y lo lanzó al suelo. Mis manos pasaron por todo su pecho y quitaron su camisa segundos después. Sus besos empezaron a descender hasta llevar a mis pechos donde se detuvo un momento para besarlos provocando que mi resperación fuera entrecortada. Subió nuevamente a mis labios. Los abrí dándole paso a su lengua, que luchaba con la mía. Separó el beso y comenzó a besar mi barbilla hasta llegar a mi oreja donde comenzó a morder el lóbulo. Haciendo que grandes descargas de energía se pasarán por todo mi cuerpo. -Serás toda mía esta noche- murmuró en mi oído. Suspire al sentir su tibio aliento chocar contra mi piel. Dios este hombre quería matarme. Quitamos el resto de nuestra ropa, aun sobre su escritorio, él me miró a los ojos y sonrió ligeramente para luego entrar en mi con suaves movimientos. Suaves y agonizantes movimientos que causaban que mi cuerpo temblara con su magnífico tacto. Seguimos sin separar nuestras miradas. Nuestros gemidos se mezclaban. Esta era una increíble sensación. Me sentía más viva que nunca. Sentía algo que jamás había sentido en mi vida y creo que en verdad me gustaba. Abrí mis ojos y me encontré en una habitación totalmente conocida para mi, era mi habitación. Me levanté lentamente de la cama y busque mi celular, para ver la hora. Eran las 10:00. ¿Cómo llegue a casa? No recuerdo lo que paso después de que Niall y yo nos fuimos de su oficina y no tome nada o eso creo. Aleje los pensamientos de mi cabeza y me dispuse a salir de mi habitación. Una vez afuera escuche risas provenientes de la cocina. Camine hasta está para encontrar y mis dos mejores amigas. -Hola- les saludé. Ambas voltearon a mirarme, pero ninguna respondió. Ella me miraban ¿enojadas? No lose, además ¿porque deberían estarlo? Así que decidí pregunta, ya que no sabia la causa. -Chicas, ¿les pasa algo?- -Si nos pasa mucho, _- dijo Hailey bastante molesta- primero olvidas recoger a Whitney, luego empiezas a irte a nose donde con nose quién y nisiquiera nos hablas y luego faltas a nuestra noche de chicas y eso sin mencionar que te fuiste del trabajo sin decir nada ¿Tienes idea de lo wue tuve que hacer para que nuestro jefe no te depidiera?- mierda la noche de chicas, lo había olvidado. Definitivamente soy la peor amiga del mundo- ¿Que es lo que te esta pasando? ¿Acaso ya no nos quieres como amigas?- -¿Que? ¡Por supuesto que no!- ¿como puede pensar eso? Ellas personas muy importantes en mi vida. Jamás desearía que dejáramos de ser amigas. -¿Entonces? ¿Que es lo que te pasa?- tenía que decir la verdad ella son mis mejores amigas no voy a mentir les, no de nuevo. -Es que...- Suspire pesadamente- yo...he estado con alguien- dije rápidamente. Ambas me miraron extrañada y yo sabia lo que estaban pensando, ellas creían que ahora tenía novio. -Espera, espera ¿tienes novio?- -No- -¿Podrías explicarte mejor?- -Bien. Recuerdan a ese chico ¿Niall?- ambas volvieron a asentir- bueno el y yo nos hemos estado viendo, pero solo hemos tenido sexo nada fuera de eso- ellas me miraron, aun no muy convencidas. -Bueno y ¿que tiene que ver el en todo esto?- pregunto Whitney, que hasta ahora había permanecido callada. -Me he estado acostando con él por un mes y bueno gracias a él no te recogí en el aeropuerto, él me saco del trabajo y digamos que todo lo que ha pasado a sido culpa de el y yo lo siento, enserio. He intentado millones de veces alejarlo pero es inevitable. Porque cada vez que me alejo lo vuelvo a encontrar y luego tenemos sexo. Es como un maldito círculo en el cual caigo una y otra vez. Aunque debo admitir que talvez una diminuta parte de mi lo disfruta y eso es bastante frustrante- después de decir eso solté un gran suspiro y mire a mis amigas, que parecían procesar la información. -¿Sabes que significa cuando te sientes así amiga?- -¿Que?- -Qué estás enamorada-[Chapter 10] Mis ojos se abrieron como platos ¿Acaso bromeaba? ¿Yo? ¿Enamorarme? ¡¡¡NO, NI EN UN MILLÓN DE AÑOS!!! Mis amigas aparentemente habían perdido la cabeza. Estaba apunto de decir algo cuando unos golpes en la puerta me interrumpieron. Camine a la puerta y la abrí. Mi mirada se conectó con un par de ojos azules ya bastante conocidos para mí. Fruncí mi seño ¿Que hacia el aquí? Cómo si leyera mi mente rápidamente contestó. -Estoy aquí porque...-soltó un largo suspiro. Parecía frustrado.- necesito un favor- cerró sus ojos después de decir eso y simplemente permaneció en silencio, esperando mi respuesta. ¿Que clase de favor necesitaba? ¿Y porque pedirlo a las 10 de la mañana? -¿Que quieres?- respondí cortante, no sabia porque lo hacía pero no quería paracer demasiado interesada en el tema, aunque con sinceridad si lo estaba. -Quiero que me acompañes a una cena de mi trabajo- ¿que? No, ni loca- por favor, si vas conmigo haré lo que quieras- agregó al ver que yo no decía nada. Hacer lo que yo quiera. Definitivamente sonaba como un muy buena idea. Podría decirle que yo se alejara de mi y así jamás verlo en mi vida. Si, eso sonaba como la mejor idea del mundo, aunque una pequeña parte de mi decía que no lo alejara y que recordara como me hiso sentir la noche anterior. Pero decidí alejar todos esos pensamientos. -Acepto, pero después de esto desapareceras de mi vida- él permaneció en silencio. Parecía tener un pequeña batalla en su interior. -Bien, vendré por ti a las ocho- dijo para luego sonreír.- oh y debes fingir que eres mi esposa- -¿Que?- grite alterada ¿Su esposa? ¿Que mierda? -Mi padre, el dueño de la empresa en la que trabajo, estará ahí y tengo mucho tiempo de no hablarle. Esta mañana me llamó y dijo que haría un cena y por accidente mencione que llevaría a mi esposa. Porque el cree que tengo una vida hecha con una esposa o bueno más bien una prometida- explicó- por favor no cambies de opinión ¿si? Prometo después de esto alejarme completamente de ti lo juro sólo necesito este pequeño favor- -No es un pequeño favor, Horan- dije seria- estoy desperdiciando mi noche de viernes en ti así que me debes una grande- -¿Una grande? Creía que ya te la había dado- dijo mirándome divertido. Mis ojos se abrieron como platos al escuchar su estúpida broma. -Idiota- le dije sin poder detener una pequeña carcajada. -No seas tan aburrida. Porque ¿Sabes? Estoy seguro que al decir eso varios recuerdos de anoche llegaron a tu mente- rodé los ojos aunque también sonreí ligeramente. -Adiós, Niall- -¿Si irás cierto?- -Si- fue lo único que dije y cerré la puerta. No pude evitarlo y una pequeña sonrisa se escapo de mis labios al igual que un suspiro. Definitivamente el necesitaba atención médica. Volví a la cocina donde mis amigas me miraban pícaras. -¿Porque tardaste tanto? ¿Hablabas con Niall?- rodé los ojos e ignore su pregunta. Camine al baño. Necesitaba tomar un ducha. La noche había caído eran las 7. Solo tenia una hora para alistarme. Todo lo que sentía en este momento era frustración. No sabia que ponerme. Debía ir formal o bueno eso fue lo que me dijo Niall en un mensaje hace no mas de 1 hora. Cuando vi ese mensaje entre en pánico. Yo no uso ropa formal así que no tenía nada. Todos mis vestidos eran de fiesta. Mierda, mierda y más mierda ¿Que voy a hacer ahora? Volví a buscar en todo mi armario y vi una pequeña caja. La abrí, en ella había un vestido negro que justo los que necesitaba en este momento. En ese momento recorde que mamá me la había dado para mi cumpleaños y había dicho que era para emergencia y yo le había contestado que probablemente no lo usaría ya que yo nunca iba a lugares así. Supongo que ella tenia razón ya que me acaba de salvar. Ya estaba lista y ahora me encontraba esperando a Niall. Segundos después se escucharon golpes en la puerta y camine rápidamente hasta está. Mire al chico en frente de mi. Vaya que se veía mejor que la ultima vez. Su traje era mucho mejor y esta vez se había puesto y unos lentes que hacían la combinación perfecta. Él me sonrió y salimos de mi edificio. Después del viaje en auto rápidamente llegamos a nuestro destino. Era restaurante bastante fino. Nisiquiera podía pronunciar su nombre. Esto no era mi estilo, yo nunca estuve acostumbrada a este tipo de cosas. Me sentía nerviosa e insegura, a pesar de que todo esto era un farsa no quería causar un mala impresión. Niall entre lazo su mano con la mía dándome, extrañamente, cierta tranquilidad. Por un momento pensé en apartar su mano, pero preferí dejarlo así. Entramos al restaurante y caminamos a una mesa donde habían varios hombres con traje y algunas mujeres. Pensé no conocer a nadie hasta que mi mirada se conectó con un par de ojos verdes. Harry. Por supuesto. La otra vez había escuchado su voz. Sabía que era él. Bueno quien diría que un idiota como él trabajaría en un lugar así. No note cuando ya nos encontrábamos sentados en unas de las sillas sobrantes. Me encontraba muy sumergida en mis pensamientos. Hasta que sentí una cálida mano acariciar mi pierna. Seguido de eso Niall de acercó mas a mi. -¿Te había dicho lo bien que se te ve ese vestido? Se amolda perfectamente a tu trasero. Así que gracias por las vista.- susurro en mi oído. Lo mire fulminante y él solo rió. -Idiota- murmure. -Repite eso y te llevare a mi auto a hacer cosas nada apropiadas-[Chapter 11] Levante una ceja y le sonreí. -¿Eso es una amenaza?- mordí mi labio. -Talvez- murmuró. Sonreí maliciosamente. - I-D-I-O-T-A - dije. Niall pareció tensarse ¿Enserio tanto le molestaba que le dijera eso? Él apretó ligeramente mi pierna y cuando estaba apunto de decir algo, el que yo suponía era su padre, lo interrumpió. -Así que Niall ¿Porque no nos presentas a tu esposa?- al decir eso último quería reír, enserio sonaba demasiado estúpido, pero me contuve. -Claro- dicho eso me miró a los ojos- ella es, _ mi es prometida- -Y ¿como se conocieron?- pregunto una de las chicas que abrazaba a Mark creo que había escuchado que así se llamaba, quien por cierto me comía con la mirada. -Bueno porque no nos cuentas esa historia tu, cariño- dijo Niall dando un ligero apretón en mi pierna. ¿Cariño? Definitivamente estaba apunto de vomitar arcoiris. Odio todos esos estúpidos apodos de parejas. -Claro- sonreí falsamente- Niall y yo no conocimos en un bar- al decir eso Niall me miró con los ojos muy abiertos- y cuando lo vi sabía que el era el hombre para mi. Después de algún tiempo Niall me hablo y simplemente nos enamoramos. El definitivamente es el hombre de mi vida- necestio un baño para vomitar todo lo que no he comido en mi vida. ¿El hombre de mi vida? No y nunca lo será. Mire a Niall quien trataba de no reír. Lo mire fulminante. Creo que necesito divertirme un poco. Tome su mano y la aparte de mi pierna. -Recuerdo ese día como si fuera ayer- agregue- Niall estaba tan nervioso que casi se hace del baño- en ese momento sentí la fulminante mirada de Niall en mi. Decidí no mirarlo y simplemente sonreír. Mire hacia Harry quien trataba de no soltar una fuerte carcajada. -Así no es como lo recuerdo- dijo Niall bastante enojado. -Amor, no trates de ocultarlo tu y yo sabemos que si paso- enserio no reír ni vomitar se me estaban haciendo una tares muy difícil. De hecho lo que sentía ahora era muy extraño ya que quería vomitar por todas las cursilerias pero a la vez quería reírme en la cara de Niall. Niall me sonrió falsamente. Sabía que en este momento quería matarme, pero eso solo me provocaba querer reír aún más. -Vaya, Niall yo no tenía ni idea que eres del tipo romántico- comentó el padre de Niall. -Ni yo- susurró de modo que solo yo pude escuchar. La cena paso de una forma increíblemente lenta. Ya estaba harta de decirle al imbécil sentado junto a mi \"amor\". Después de algo que yo sentí como un año la cena se acabo todos nos despedimos. Claro que Mark o como sea que sea su nombre, se que no se llama así, pero el me dijo su nombre y la verdad ahora no lo recuerdo como sea ese tipo medio su número y dijo que lo llamara si me aburría con Niall. El era un idiota. Estaba coqueteando conmigo y su novia estaba cerca. Talvez yo si ando siempre con alguien diferente pero yo nunca la quito el novio a alguien. Ahora íbamos en el auto de Niall en completo silencio. La verdad no había mucho que decir. -_- dijo Niall rompiendo el silencio. -¿Que?- -Gracias, ya sabes por todo- -De nada- respondí dándole un pequeña sonrisa. -Mira se que el trato era ir a la cena y desaparecer de tu vida pero...- soltó un largo suspiro.- necesito que vayas conmigo a la casa de mis padres- -¿Que?- grite literalmente. -Es el cumpleaños de mi madre y mi padre le contó que tengo una esposa así que mi padre cree que sería una buena idea- -No- conteste firme. Definitivamente no voy a ir a la casa de sus padre. -Por favor- rogó y ese fue el momento en el que note que ya estábamos frente a mi edificio. Estaba apunto de bajarme pero Niall me detuvo.-Prometo que esta vez si me iré de tu vida por favor- esta vez el miro directamente a los ojos. Trate de apartar mi mirada pero era imposible sus ojos azules simplemente te cautivaban. No quería ceder pero el enserio parecía desesperado. -Bien per que sea la última vez- el sonrió. -Gracias enserio prometo que te recompensare- -Si como sea adios- -Hasta luego, cariño- lo mire fulminante. -No hagas que me arrepienta- el rió. -Hay que practicar ¿no?- -No- dije molesta y baje de su auto. Entre al edificio y luego al elevador. Presione el botón con el numero de mi piso y esperé pacientemente. Las puertas se abrieron y camine a mi apartemento. Cuando estaba a sólo unos pasos de este alguien salí y de imediato lo reconocí, Jack. -Hola- le dije. El me sonrió. -Lo siento fascinaría hablar contigo pero enserio debo irme- -De acuerdo te veré despues- dicho eso el se fue. Entre a mi apartamento y cerré la puerta detrás de mi. Vi a mi mejor amiga sentada en el sofá con cara de idiota. Enserio tenía cara de idiota. -Hola- -Hola- saludo muy sonriente. -¿Que hacia Jack aquí? - -Bueno ya sabes cosas- reí con su comentario. -¿Enserio ya te acostaste con el?- -¿Que? No- se quedo en silencio un momento- de hecho de eso quería hablar- -¿De porque no tienes sexo con el?- -No, es mas bien una pregunta que tengo que hacerte- -Bien hazlo- -¿Has tenido sexo con Jack?- fruncí el seño ¿Enserio me preguntaba eso? -Claro que no. Jack es como un hermano para mi jamás me acostaría con mi hermano- ella suspiro y sonrió. -Bien porque sería muy extraño salir con alguien con el que ya estuviste- -Pero tu estuviste con...- en este momento me quede callada al notar lo que estaba apunto de decir. Ella frunció el seño. -¿Yo estuve con quien? - -Nadie- -¿Acaso tuviste sexo con alguien con quien yo salí y yo no lo sabía? - -¿Que? No ¿De donde sacaste eso? Es ridículo. Mejor cambiemos de tema ¿No quieres saber cómo me fue en la cena?- dije nerviosa -No me cambies de tema y responde mirándome a los ojos- trague saliva. Mierda.[Chapter 12] Me quede en silencio. Mientras Hailey me miraba con una mirada asesina. Cerré mis ojos con fuerza. Yo y mi gran bocota. En este momento sinceramente no sabia si decirle. No sabia si eso seria una buena idea. La verdad no quería lastimar la. Suspire. Supongo que algún día esa verdad tendría que salir. Pero, la verdad ubiera preferido que esta nunca ubiera salido. A veces la verdad es la que mas daño hace. -Yo...- comencé a decir, pero las palabras simplemente no salían de mi boca. En estos momentos es en los que necesito que alguien toque la puerta o llame a mi celular. Pero claro nadie interrumpe en momentos así.- yo... ¿si te lo digo te vas a enojar conmigo?- -¿Tengo razones para enojarme?- dijo enojada. -Talvez- susurre. Creo ya era hora de decirle pero la verdad tenía miedo de como fuera a reaccionar. No quería perder nuestra amistad. -¿Recuerdas cuando me presentaste a Harry? ¿Cuando sólo eran amigos?- le pregunté. Ella asintió. - Bueno, el día siguiente, después de conocerlo, lo encontré en un bar. Estuvimos hablando un tiempo y luego una cosa llevo a la otra y desperté en su departamento. No recuerdo mucho de lo que paso, pero si se que paso. Una semana después de que es pasará tu dijiste que Harry era tu nuevo novio y la verdad eso me sorprendió, ya que el parecía el tipo de chico con los que yo siempre estoy- Suspire pesadamente- Nunca te dije nada porque te veías tan ilusionada con él. Yo no quería arruinarte lo. No quería que supieras que hace sólo una semana ese del que te habías enamorado se había acostado con tu mejor amiga- Hailey permaneció en silencio por un par de minutos. -¿Por eso nunca te cayó bien?- preguntó ella, finalmente. -Si, sabía que el era un mujeriego osea el se metió conmigo y contigo- ella me miró sin decir nada. Probablemente procesando la información. Habían pasado alrededor de 2 días desde lo que le dije a Hailey y la verdad las cosas no habían cambiado. Hablamos un poco más al respecto pero nada demasiado importante más que un interrogatorio por parte de mis dos amigas, ya que es obvio que también le dijimos a Whit. Aparte de que también me preguntaron por la cena y yo les conté que Niall me había pedido ir al cumpleaños de su madre. Ahora nos encontrábamos en el centro comercial. -¿Ir al cumpleaños de su mamá? - pregunto Whitney sorprendida. -Si- le dije. -¿Enserio?- -Si- murmure. -Espera ¿Niall es de por aquí? Osea, ¿El acaso no es de otro país o algo así?- -No lo se- -¿Y que pasa si tienes que viajar?- -¿A que te refieres con viajar?- pregunté confundida. -Osea si debes salir del pais- -Si según el eso es lo que vamos a hacer pues esta demente- dije- ni loca viajaría con él a ningún lado- No podía creer lo que estaba haciendo en este momento. Me sentía como una idiota. ¿Y donde me encontraba? En el maldito aeropuerto. Aparte de eso tenía al mayor idiota del mundo junto a mi. Niall. Ese idiota me había convencido de ir a Irlanda para celebrar el cumpleaños de su madre. ¿Cómo me había convencido? Creo que no quiero hablar de lo que paso anoche. Debo recordar no tomar con Niall cerca. Sentí una mano escabullirse por mi cintura. Mire a Niall fulminante y él sonrió de lado. Para luego acercarse y robarme un pequeño beso. Lo mire enojada y me solté de su agarre. Él río ligeramente. -Me fascina cuando te enojas- susurro en mi oído. Provocando que mi piel se erizara. Mordí mi labio evitando que un suspiro saliera de mi boca. Escuche como Niall volvía a reir y luego depositó un húmedo beso en cuello.[Chapter 13] No pude evitarlo y un pequeño jadeo escapó de mis labios. Tenía que controlarme, pero Niall provocaba algo muy extraño en mi. Una parte de mi decía que lo alejara en este momento o volvería a pasar lo de anoche y mi otra parte deseaba que volviera a suceder. Esto era confuso. La voz de la mujer, que anunciaban nuestro vuelo, interrumpió mis pensamientos. Niall tomo su maleta en una mano y en la otra mi maleta. Él comenzó a caminar y me hizo señas para que lo siguiera. De mala gana lo seguí. Hasta la fila para poder entrar en el avión. Después de esperar alrededor de 5 minutos finalmente ya me encontraba en mi asiento. Con Niall sentado junto a mi. Vi como coqueteaba con la chica del asiento del lado. Rodé los ojos. Este será un largo viaje, pensé. Finalmente ya habíamos aterrizado y ahora me encontraba bajando del avión junto con Niall, quien después de coquetear con la zorra esa no para de molestar durante todo el vuelo. Este fue definitivamente el peor viaje que he hecho en mi vida. Después de recoger nuestro equipaje Niall pidió un taxi, al cual le dio las indicaciones de como llegar a la casa de sus padres. Minutos después ya nos encontrábamos en la puerta de la casa. Niall, después de pagarle al taxista, se colocó junto a mi para después tocar el timbre. Esperamos un par de segundos hasta que un señora de mediana edad abrió la puerta con una sonrisa y al ver a Niall su sonrisa se extendió. -¡NIALL!- gritó ella. Para luego abrazar a Niall. Él le devolvió el abrazo y segundos después se separaron. La mirada de ella se dirigió a mi y me sonrió ampliamente. -Tu debes ser _ ¿no?- preguntó a lo que asentí suavemente.- Un placer yo soy Maura la madre Niall. No puedo creer que seas su prometida y yo que pensé que el jamás encontraría un novia- -Mamá- murmuró Niall y lo que yo solté un pequeña risa. -Estoy muy feliz de estar aquí- le dije a su madre dándole mi mejor sonrisa. A pesar de que todo esto era una farsa Maura parecía un buena persona, a diferencia de su hijo que era un idiota. -A mi también me alegra mucho conocerte, cariño- dijo sonriendome amablemente. Escuche a Niall bufar y entrar a la casa dejando mi maleta junto a mi. -NIALL- le dijo Maura. -¿Que?- dijo él de mala gana. -¿No vas a ayudar a tu prometida con su maleta?- mordí mi labio tratando de no reír al ver la expresión de Niall. Quién rodó los ojos y tomó mi maleta para luego ir al segundo piso de la casa. -Pasa, cariño- me dijo ella. Le sonreí y entre en la la casa. Mire la casa por unos segundos. -Bonita casa- dije. -Gracias- me sonrió- ¿ porque no vas arriba y decansas un poco? Los llamaré cuando la comida este lista- asentí e hice a lo que me dijo. Observé el segundo piso con detenimiento, tratando de buscar la habitación en la que me quedaría con Niall o bueno supongo que me quedaré con él. Mire las diferentes puertas y vi una entreabierta, me acerqué a esta y la abrí para luego revelar a Niall buscando algo en su maleta. -¿Que buscas?- le pregunté acercandome a él. -El regalo de mi madre- dijo sin mirarme. -¿Le compraste un regalo?- -Es mi madre- respondió con obviedad. -¿Y que es?- -Un collar y unos pendientes- -Oh- fue todo lo que dije. -¿Necesitas ayuda?- Dije despues de un tiempo. El me miro y sonrió pícaro. -Estoy seguro de que puedes ayudar en otra cosa- dijo tomándome de la cintura. Rodé los ojos y lo empuje soltandome de su agarre. Después de dormir un rato y negarme a la oferta de Niall sobre ducharnos juntos, ya que según él sería más rapido. Me duche (sola) y me cambie de ropa. Ahora nos encontrábamos cenando la deliciosa comida que la mamá de Niall había preparado. -Así que _ ¿Porque si están comprometidos no tienes un anillo?- pregunto Maura de repente. Mis ojos se abrieron como platos. Mierda. Olvidamos el anillo. Niall me miro alarmado y yo no sabía que decir. -Yo...-[Chapter 14] Yo...- empecé a decir- lo perdí- Al decir eso Maura frunció el ceño. -¿Lo perdiste? ¿Como?- -Ammm bueno...yo...- -No lo sabemos, simplemente un día el anillo no estaba- interrumpió Niall. -Oh..que pena- dijo el padre de Niall. -Si es una lástima ¿Le compraras otro anillo?- preguntó Maura. -Supongo- murmuró Niall. -¿Supones? ¡Niall, es el anillo de tu esposa!- -Mamá, no hagas un drama por un simple anillo además a _ no le importa ¿Cierto?- Preguntó él mirándome y en ese momento se me ocurrió una perfecta idea para molestar a Niall. -Claro que si me importa ¿Como puedes decir que no? Si ese anillo representa nuestro compromiso- dije dramáticamente haciendo mi mayor intento de parecer que estoy apunto de llorar. -Esta decidido iremos a comprar un nuevo anillo mañana- dijo Maura. -Pero...mamá- protestó Niall. -Dije que está decidido- Niall bufó y yo mordí mi labio evitando reír. -Gracias ahora tendré que comprarte un estúpido anillo- me susurró y yo sonreí victoriosa. El resto de la cena fue bastante agradable. Maura era una persona increíble al igual que Bobby, el padre de Niall. No entendía como con padres tan buenos Niall era un completo idiota. Ahora me encontraba en la habitacion que comparto con Niall. Estaba sentada en la cama mientras hablaba con Hailey y Whitney por mensajes. Mientras que Niall tomaba un ducha. Me encontraba metida en mi celular hasta que la puerta del baño abriéndose me sacó de mi trance. Levanté mi mirada para luego conectarme con los azules ojos de Niall. Quien sólo tenía un toalla alrededor de su cintura. Le di una rápida mirada a su cuerpo y mordí mi labio al ver su descubierto abdomen. -¿Te gusta lo que ves?- preguntó Niall al notar mi mirada en su cuerpo. Rodé los ojos y no le respondí. Lo escuche reír para que luego caminara hacia mí. Miraba la pantalla de mi teléfono pero no estaba poniendo atención a ningún mensaje ya que era consciente de lo que Niall hacía. Segundos más tarde mi teléfono fue quitado de mis manos. -¡NIALL!- le grite. -¿Que?- -Dame mi teléfono- - ¿Y si no lo hago que?- -Creo que eso ya lo preguntaste un vez y no te fue bien- -Si me fue bien estuvimos apunto de tener sexo, y lo hubiéramos hecho pero yo amiga nos interrumpió- sonrió- así que...¿porque no mejor compensamos esa vez que me dejaste con las ganas?- -Ni lo sueñes, Horan- -Mi apellido suena sexy en tus labios- -Pervertido- Él sonrió y rápidamentese colocó sobre mi en la cama. Dejándome atrapada. Acerco sus labios a los míos y volvió a sonreír. -Niall no podemos hacer esto. Es la casa de tus padres- -Como si nunca hubiera tenido sexo con una chica aquí- eso me había ofendido y mucho ¿Acaso el cree que soy una de sus putas? -No soy una de tus putas, idiota- -Eso lo se. Eres mejor- me miro a los ojos mientras lo decía y no pude evitar que mi corazón se acelerará al escuchar esas palabras salir de su boca. En un rápido movimiento nuestro labios se juntaron formando un perfecto beso. Si lengua luchó con la mía mientras nuestros labios se movían en perfecta sincronía. Mis manos se movieron a su cabello mientras que las de él, separaron mis piernas para colocarse en medio de ellas. El beso se tornaba cada vez más caliente y como si no pudiera estar más excitada, Niall junto nuestras pelvis. Provocando que yo rompa el beso para soltar un gemido. No supe en que momento sucedió pero ya nos encontrábamos desnudos en la cama. -Niall- gemí ya que Niall se encontraba besando y lamiendo mi centro provocando placer en todo mi cuerpo. -Aún no hermosa tienes que esperarme- dijo Niall al notar que estaba apunto de llegar. Segundos después, Niall de encontraba nuevamente besando mis labios, torturandome ya que no entraba en mí. -Por favor- gemí en su oído. -Dime que quieres- susurro en mi oído. -Hazme tuya-[Chapter 15] Dicho eso Niall entró fuertemente en mi provocando que gimiera su nombre fuertemente. Demasiado fuerte, sólo esperaba que los padres de Niall no me hubieran escuchado. Niall me besaba los labios mientras que sus bruscas embestidas me hacían temblar. Toda la habitación estaba llena de gemidos que se mezclaban con el sonido de nuestros cuerpos chocar. Minutos después ambos llegamos al clímax para luego caer rendidos y dormir. A la mañana siguiente desperté por los sonidos que venían de la cocina. Abrí mis ojos lentamente, tratando de acostumbrarme a la luz. Una vez mis ojos estaban abiertos me dispuse a buscar a Niall y note que estaba sola. Suspire con pesadez al recordar lo que había pasado anoche. Yo era una completa idiota por caer en los brazos de Niall tan fácilmente, pero simplemente no podía evitarlo y aunque no quisiera admitirlo Niall provocaba algo en mi que me hacía sentir completa como si siempre algo me hiciera falta y Niall ahora lo llenaba. Me dispuse a levantarme y a tomar una rápida ducha para luego, después de vestirme, bajar a la cocina. Escuche varias risas provenientes de la cocina y segundos después entre el esta. La madre de Niall me miro y me dedicó una tierna sonrisa. -¡Miren quien despertó!- dijo la Maura con entusiasmo- tuvieron una noche agitada ¿no?- mis ojos de abrieron como platos. -¿Que?- pregunté nerviosa deseando no haber escuchado bien. -Tranquila cariño sólo estaba bromeando- Maura río ligeramente. Mientras que Niall soltó una fuerte carcajada. -Debiste ver tu cara- dijo Niall sin parar de reir. -Idiota- murmure. Niall paró de reír inmediatamente y me miro fulminante. -¿Como acabas de llamarme?- dijo entredientes. Una maliciosa apareció en mis labios. Mire a mi lado y note que Maura se había ido. Mi sonrisa creció, sabiendo que en este momento le podría decir cualquier cosa. -Idiota- le repetí. Lo escuche gruñir pero luego sonrió ligeramente. -Anoche no me decías idiota ¿o si?- en ese momento mi sonrisa de borró y ahora era yo quien lo veía fulminante. -Lo de anoche fue un error- el bufó y rodó los ojos. -Siempre dices los mismo ¿Porque no admites que si te gustó?- -¡Porque no me gusto!- murmure molesta. -Si lo que hacemos no te gusta ¿Porque sigues aquí? ¿ Porque no simplemente te has alejado de mi?- Permanecí en silencio sabiendo que el tenía razón, pero aún así no quería admitirlo mi orgullo me lo impedía. Me crucé de brazos y lo mire mal. Él suspiro. -Hoy no es el día para discutir esta estupidez ¿de acuerdo?- dijo Niall- la fiesta de cumpleaños de mi madre es hoy así que por favor intentemos no discutir ¿Si?- asentí ligeramente- bien- dijo Niall saliendo de la cocina. Narra Niall La fiesta había empezado. Varios amigos de mi madre, que me recordaban, me saludaban aunque la verdad yo no sabia quienes eran ni la mitad de ellos. Estaba algo aburrido así que busque a _ con la mirada, por lo menos la podría molestar. Después de unos segundos la vi hablando o más bien coqueteando con chico. Sentí mi cuerpo arder y unas muy grandes ganas de reventar la cara del chico contra el suelo. Sin nisiquiera notarlo ya me encontraba caminando hacia ellos. Mi mirada de conecto con la de _. Ella rodó los ojos al verme y trató de ignorarme. -Hola, cariño- le dije a _ abrazandola por la cintura. El chico con el que hablaba frunció el seño confundido al escuchar como le había dicho a _. Sonreí en mi interior por haber logrado mi objetivo. _ sonrió falsamente hacia el chico. -¿Nos disculpas un momento?- ella le pregunto al chico el cual asintió no muy seguro. _ me tomo de la mano y me llevo a un lugar un poco alejado del chico, aunque aún lo podía ver sabia que él no podía escuchar nada. -¿Que mierda estas haciendo?- grito ella. Me quedé un momento en silencio buscando un excusa -Alejarte del chico con el que estabas coqueteando porque si alguien te ve van a pensar que me estas engañando o que lo nuestro es una farsa- -En primer lugar todo esto esto es una farsa y en segundo lugar no estaba coqueteando con nadie- -Si claro y yo soy ciego- ella me miro mal y empezó a decir palabras que no escuché ya que mi mirada de concentró en sus labios moviéndose y en lo único que podía pensar era en besar esos perfectos y carnosos labios. Lamí mis labios sintiendo el deseo recorrer mi cuerpo. Sin pensarlo más me acerqué a ella juntando nuestros labios en un beso. Ella tardó un rato en responder el beso, pero segundos después sus la labios se movían en perfecta sincronía con los míos. Mis manos se encontraban en su cintura mientras que las de ella se encontraban alrededor de mi cuello. La acerque a mi pegandola más a mi cuerpo provocando que un jadeo se escapara de su boca. Mi lengua pidió el acceso a su boca y ella lo aceptó. El beso de tornaba cada vez más caliente y parecía que ninguno quería separarse. Segundos más tarde finalmente no separamos por falta de aire. Mire a _ a los ojos mientras nuestras frentes estaban juntas y en ese momento sentí como mi estómago se revolvió sintiendo mil emociones y simplemente deseando nunca separarme de ella. -Te amo- salió de mis labios antes de poder detenerlo.[Chapter 16] Narra Niall Las palabras salieron de mi boca y nisiquiera pude pensar en detenerlas. _ me miro incrédula antes de alejarme de un empujón. -¿Que acabas de decir?- preguntó ella con los ojos abiertos. Estaba apunto de decir algo cuando mi padre me interrumpió, cosa que agradecí. -Niall, tu madre te está buscando. Quiere que estés con ella- apreté mis labios sintiendo la mirada de , no era exactamente una linda mirada, su rostro mostraba algo de confusión combinada con enojo. Mire a mi padre y asentí levemente para luego hacer camino entre las personas e ir con mi madre. Mientras me caminaba hacia mi madre pasando entre todas las personas no podía dejar de pensar en lo sucedido minutos atrás, pero la verdad es que lo que le dije a ella era cierto. Ya tenía mucho de estar atraído de una manera mayor que sólo sexual y simplemente había sido demasiado terco como para aceptarlo. Por más cursi y estúpidamente romántico que esto suene lo que le dije a ella había salido de mi corazón y muy en el fondo yo sabía que había querido decirle esto cada vez que la hacia mía, cada vez que su cuerpo se retorcia de placer bajo el mío, cada vez que llegábamos al clímax juntos tenía unas increíbles ganas de decirle esas dos simples palabras las cuales antes de ella eran una gran estupidez para mi. Suspire con frustración ,una vez me encontraba sentado junto a mi madre, porque a pesar de que ya le había dicho lo que sentía a , ella estaba molesta y mucho. No parecía que la agradara mucho la idea, pero yo no podía hacer nada ella ya se había metido bajo mi piel y eso era lo que más me frustraba de todo esto. Yo había caído ante ella. Narra _ Sus palabras se repetían en mi mente una y otra vez. ¿Él estaba enamorado de mi? ¿Como se supone que debería reaccionar a eso? Yo definitivamente no estaba enamorada de él. Entonces ¿Que haces en su casa fingiendo ser su prometida? Una molesta voz dijo en mi cabeza. No, yo no estoy enamorada de él. Él no me gusta. Él es un idiota. Un idiota que no me gusta. No me gusta. Pase mis manos por mi cara con frustración. ¿Porque me siento de esta manera si el no me gusta? Decidí salir de la casa de los Horan, sólo para poder aclarar mi mente. Camine por las solas y frías calles de Irlanda, todo se encontraba sólo y oscuro. Mis piernas de congelaban gracias al corto vestido que traía. Me abracé a mi misma buscando algo de calor, pero que era inútil. Continúe caminando, a pesar de estar sufriendo una hipotermia, no iba a volver a esa y enfrentar a Niall. Era cobarde y mucho, pero no me atrevería a mirarlo después de lo que me dijo. Camine hasta encontrar una pequeña tienda de comida. Entre en esta y busque algo para olvidar todo lo de esta noche, alcohol. Encontré una botella de whisky y no dude en comprarla. Salí de la pequeña tienda y fui hasta una parque, no muy lejos de la tienda. Me senté en una de las bancas que se encontraban en el parque. Abrí la botella tomando un gran trago. Hice una mueca el líquido quemar mi garganta. Después de varios tragos ya sentía mi cabeza dar vueltas, estaba segura de que si me levantaba caería al suelo. -¿Tratas de olvidar a alguien?- escuché una extraña voz detrás de mi. Mire hacía atrás, buscando la extraña voz y mirada se conectó con un para de ojos marrones. Era un hombre de cabello negro y rastros de barba en su rostro. Tenía una pequeña pervertida sonrisa en su rostro, la derretiría a cualquier chica. -Uh...- fue lo único que logre articular. -Soy Zayn- se presentó amablemente. -Soy _- -Lindo nombre- dijo guiñandome un ojo. Sentí mis mejillas sonrojarse. ¿Me estoy sonrojando? Debo estar muy ebria. - dime _ ¿Que haces aquí tomando una botella de whisky sola?- -Supongo que tratando de olvidar- el me miro acercándose lentamente y sonrió al estar muy cerca. -Estoy seguro de que puedo ayudarte con eso- Me desperté por los molestos rayos de sol que caían directamente en mi rostro. Abrí mis ojos perezosamente y sentí un fuerte dolor en mi cabeza. Probablemente era resaca. Me moví en la cama sintiendo mi cuerpo desnudo rozar con las suaves sábanas de la cama. Esperen.. ¿estaba desnuda? Abrí mis ojos completamente de golpe. Mire alrededor de mi pensando en encontrar una habitación desconocida, pero fue todo lo contrario, me encontraba en la habitación que compartía con Niall en la casa de sus padres. ¿Que mierda paso anoche?[Chapter 17] Me senté en la cama confundida y un fuerte dolor invadió mi cabeza. ¿Como llegue aquí? Lo último que recordaba era que había hablado con Zayn. Después de eso no recordaba absolutamente nada. Estaba apunto de levantarme cuando la puerta se abrió. Era Niall. -Buenos dias- dijo sonriendo ligeramente. -¿Como llegue aquí?- le pregunté ignorando su buenos días. Una sonrisa apareció en sus labios, provocando una escalofrío en mi cuerpo. ¿Que mierda hice? -¿Enserio no lo recuerdas?- mordió su labio mientras sonreía y me miraba divertido. -Si lo recordara no te lo estaría preguntando, idiota- su sonrisa de borró de su rostro y me miro mal. -Bueno si lo quieres saber tendrás que recordarlo por tu cuenta- me miro unos segundos y nuevamente un sonrisa apareció en sus labios- sólo te diré que fue el mejor trio del mundo- mis ojos de abrieron como platos. No era la peor cosa del mundo, pero nunca había sido la clase de chica a la que le gusta hacer ese tipo de cosas. -¿Que?- fue lo único que logre decir. -Lo que escuchaste, preciosa- sonrió pícaro y me guiño un ojo. En ese momento que sentía como una perra. Mi cara probablemente expresaba todo lo que pensaba, porque Niall soltó una fuerte carcajada. -Debiste ver tu cara- dijo sin parar de reír. Mi ceño se frunció al no entender la causa de su risa- vamos , cambia esa cara sólo estoy bromeando- mi expresión cambió completamente y lo mire mal. -Eres un idiota- mordí mi labio reprimiendo mi sonrisa, ya que sabía que no le gustaba cuando le decía eso, y como lo supuse el paro de reir. Ahora era él quien me miraba mal. -Dilo una vez más...- murmuró entredientes. -¿Y que? ¿Que me vas a hacer? IDIOTA- Niall de lanzó sobre mi, acostandome en la cama de nuevo. Su cuerpo se encontraba sobre el mío y mi respiración se empezó a acelerar cuando nuestras miradas se conectaron. -¿Que recuerdas de anoche?- me preguntó sin separar nuestras miradas. -Recuerda haberme ido de la fiesta y también recuerdo que conocí a un chico, se llamaba Zayn- -¿Recuerdas la razón por la que te fuiste de la fiesta?- mi ceño se frunció tratando de recordar pero sólo hice que me doliera más mi cabeza. Negué con mi cabeza al no lograr recordar nada y Niall sonrió, para segundos más tarde tomar mi piernas y acercarme más a el. -¿Quieres saber que te puedo hacer?- pregunto respondiendo lo que yo lo había dicho minutos atrás. - Porque te puedo hacer tantas cosas- sonrió pícaro mientras acariciaba mis desnudas piernas. Sus caricias me enloquecian y bloqueaban completamente mis pensamientos. Acercó su rostro al mío juntando nuestros labios. Mis labios sin dudarlo correspondieron el beso. Llenando todo el ambiente de deseo y lujuria. Mis manos viajaron al pecho de Niall acaricandolo suavemente. Niall separó nuestros labios para bajar a mi cuello, el cual lamió, mordió y beso. Continuó su camino a mis pechos, al sentir el contacto de sus labios sobre estos, mi cuerpo se arqueó provocando que mi entrepierna chocara con la suya. Un gruñido salió de la garganta de Niall al sentir nuestro contacto. Mis manos viajaron a su pantalón bajandolo junto con su boxer, dejándolo desnudo sobre mi. Niall dejó mis pechos y volvió a mis labios. Para luego penetrarme fuertemente. Haciendo que un gemido saliera de mis labios. La habitación se llenó de gemidos y jadeos por parte de ambos. Las fuertes embestidas de Niall me hacían estar cada vez más cerca. Minutos después sentí es clímax apoderarse de mi cuerpo debilitandome por completo. El cuerpo de Niall cayó sobre el mío, pero sin aplastante. Mi respiración agitada de comenzó a calmar poco a poco y dirigí mi mano al cabello de Niall sintiéndolo ligeramente húmedo. Este momento era perfecto y deseaba que nunca terminara, aunque nunca sería capaz de admitirlo en voz alta. El sonido de la puerta interrumpió todos mis pensamientos de Niall hizo que me sobresaltara ligeramente. -¿Niall? ¿Estas ahí?- dijo la madre de Niall al otro lado de la puerta. Niall soltó un gruñido levantándose de mala gana. -¿Que sucede mamá?- -El desayuno está listo- dijo ella y a pesar de que no nos podía ver supuse que estaba sonriendo. -Bajaremos en un momento- -De acuerdo, cariño- dicho eso escuché sus pasos alejarse de la puerta. -Por más que me gustaría que estuvieras desnuda todo el día, creo que deberías vestirte- dijo recorriendo mi cuerpo con la mirada y lamiendo sus labios- aunque claro no me enojaría si hacemos una segunda ronda- ","Summary":" Capítulo 1 Abrí los ojos y me encontré con una casa desconocida.
