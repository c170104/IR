[{"Movie":"Tristan + Isolde","Title":"Captivity","Author":"IvoryMoonlight","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7060053","Passage":"[Chapter 1] AUTHOR'S NOTE! So obviously, I am one of the many girls in this world who have watched the movie and fell in love with it. So last night, as I was watching it for like...the sixth time, this idea popped in my head. I was actually inspired by the moment when Tristan is making this wristlet for Isolde because I realised the scene where he gives it to her is 'missing', if you will. So it started out as a missing scene for the movie and it ended up in this, a one-shot from Isolde's POV. It's my very first fanfic of Tristan + Isolde so please be kind. I can only hope I have captured her character decently. I expect to write another, similar one Tristan's POV, unless you don't like it. So I hope you won't be bored while reading this and I hope that you could give me some constructive criticism. I do need it and long for it! So enjoy! Bond. That's what it represented. Bond, commitment, love. It was so small, so unimportant and yet it meant the world to her, it was the one thing she could hold on to for hope, hope that fate would smile down on them and that the winds would soon blow favourably for them. Some people would misjudge its meaning as ownership but she knew better, and so did he. It was just a string with some small rocks instead of beads, really nothing much, but it was her most treasured, precious item, the one thing she never dared take off her wrist. It was the one thing she had left from him, the one thing that reminded her of the beautiful moments she guarded well and kept safe in her heart. She rolled on her stomach, careful to be swift and gentle so not to wake her sleeping husband by shifting too vividly on the soft mattress. With a sigh, she brought the wrist before her silvery blue eyes, brushing her fingertips on the small bracelet Tristan had made for her when he still was in Ireland, as her 'captive'. It was his gift of gratitude to her, for saving him, showing him another aspect of 'Irish kindness' than the one he knew. It was the only gift she had accepted with her heart leaping with joy and surprised beam, for he had made it with his own hands, with sincerity and warm-heartedness. \"Here. For you.\" he had surprised her back then, his stern voice hiding the promise of a mischievous grin. She remembered running across the golden beach with her arms burdened with food and water for him. She had had no time to catch her breath or greet him when he produced the small item, holding it in his open palm before her, a wide, cunning smile playing across his lips. A grin of smugness that grew even brighter as she freed one arm and reached for it bashfully. She remembered examining it in her palm with eyes wide and lips parted in pleasant surprise. She heard a breathless, silent giggle escape her rosy lips as she recalled his sudden frown of uncertainty and perplexion when he gave him no reply. \"You…don't like it, do you?\" he had guessed almost disappointed and she had strained herself from wrapping her arms around him in gratitude. He was still but a British stranger, she barely knew him truly. \"No, I…\" she stammered, she was speechless after all. She never expected him to offer her a present. \"I…love it. It's beautiful.\" She managed to master as she kept staring at the small wristlet of sea-rocks, pale and white as her own skin, shining like pearls as the faint sunrays kissed upon them. She fiddled a bit with it in her fingers before the appreciative, generous smile cracked on her lips and brought his clever one back on his ridiculously charming face again. \"It really is. Did you make it?\" \"Well, obviously there's no way I could've bought it, is there?\" he reasoned cheekily and she bit her lips, a faint shade of pink spreading across the creamy white skin of her cheeks as she nodded in agreement. \"Either way, I'm glad you like it.\" \"I do.\" She replied and she was surprised by how composed she was, by how well she could control her emotions that were about to burst out of her. \"Why?\" \"I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me. I mean, it's the least I can do for you.\" he had simply said, shrugging indifferently his shoulders. She had smiled wildly as she practically tossed the small package of everything he needed in his arms so that she could put the wristlet on. Once she had, she marveled at it with gleeful appreciation before remembering they were not entirely alone. She could feel Bragnae's perceptive eyes burning holes on her back as she took her time walking towards them. But most importantly, she could feel his eyes, the penetrating, piercing ones seeing right through her, as if reading her darkest wishes and desires while her fingertips, still tingled gingerly at the spots where her delicate fingers brushed with his own calloused ones. Now that small gift was just the memento of a time when she had been finally, even for a short while, content, alive, free even. But every memory of bliss slowly faded away with each kiss she forcefully accepted by her husband, with each day Tristan was gone, probably avoiding her, for even when he was present she caught him staring at her with enraged jealousy and hurt written all over his handsome face whenever she walked in town with Marke, a face of stone, drained from any kind of warm feeling. And oh, how she wished she could smoothen his pain away and hers along with his. She could have been angered by the fact that he had caused this suffering to both of them, that he was the reason she married a man she knew she would never love in a way different than friendly. But despite his distancing himself from her every passing day, she could tell how he had regretted his decision and the advice he had given her onboard the British vessel. Yet regret could not undo what was already done. It only burnt him down, put his soul in raged flames, she knew him well enough to see that. She sighed gravely, rubbing her temple with two fingers and then running them gently across her face down to her chin. A week, or maybe more, had passed since the day she had to married Marke and had to put away her love for Tristan and she wasn't sure for how long she would bear having to give herself to another man. Lying to herself, pretending it was him was not helpful anymore, never had worked anyway. And after all, it wasn't just the night she had to give herself to Marke but the day as well. She had to give herself to him when walking in the market as he took his hand in hers or made her taste some treaty from his hand or held her in his arms possessively. When they did everything she wished she and Tristan would but never could. She remembered the moment when the kind Lord had commented on how beautiful her wristlet looked and she wasn't sure if she should have laughed at the irony or cried. Instead she had bit her lips as images of her moments with Tristan invaded forcefully her mind and heart all over again, causing her to ache beyond words and her soul to shatter in millions of tiny pieces. \"It was a gift\" she had said and her heart had nearly stopped beating when she remembered how the day it was gifted to her, she had also been gifted with the young man's love also. The first time when he had touched her, only then had she realized that it wasn't he who was being held captive, but her. Her attention had been captured by him since the day she found him unconscious on her beach. He had been all she could think of. And when he woke up, his words, his looks, everything about him was constantly occupying her thoughts. Slowly, her heart was next to be held captive, the moment he offered her his gift. A faint smile made the corners of her lips curl slightly as she brushed her fingertips on the small rocklets once more. Maybe those other people were right. Maybe it symbolized more than just bond. Maybe it symbolized how he owned her heart, her captivity by him. Yes, that's what she would call it for the remainder of her life. Her gift of captivity. Sorry for the abrupt ending! Please tell me what you thought! It will be much appreciated! Thank you so much for reading and reviewing (if you do!) Love you all! ","Summary":" AUTHOR'S NOTE!

As my other Kernow stories do, it has, as its foundation, the film Tristan + Isolde. Each of these ( The Making of a King (1), The Long and Lonely Nights (2), To See the Shadows Through the Mists (3 )…. And Walk in Dreams and Darkness (4) and their companion piece Isolda (5) are each stand-alone but may be better if read in above order. Again, as in my other Kernow stories, this is written in fairly modern English but with a hint ( hopefully) here and there to give a feel of Marke's time. I write these stories purely for my own entertainment. . .~~*~~ My thanks as ever to Rufus Sewell for his creation of Marke. . .~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~ . My Song for this story is RED's Hymn For The Missing. By Robert Graves . Tried to walk together But the night was growing dark Thought you were beside me But I reached and you were gone Sometimes I hear you calling From some lost and distant shore I hear you crying softly For the way it was before . Where are you now? Are you lost? Will I find you again? Are you alone? Are you afraid? Are you searching for me? Why did you go? I had to stay Now I am reaching for you Will you wait, will you wait? Will I see you again? . You took it with you when you left These scars are just a trace Now it wanders lost and wounded This heart that I misplaced. AND WALK IN DREAMS AND DARKNESS I leant on the rail and watched the two young squires practicing their moves in the training yard below, their grunts and gasps and the dull thumps from their wooden swords echoing around us. I laughed and turned to Mordred beside me. \"No holds barred there.\" \"It is as well that they do not use steel. One if not both would be hurt. There is real venom behind each stroke.\" \"No, no! They fight hard, it is true but Melor is to be knighted soon. And Tristan, he fights as hard as he able at all times.\" \"That is so.\" \"Watch, see the ease and grace of his moves! He is two years or so younger, and yet… He will be a fine swordsman, a knight to be honoured … perhaps to be the King's Champion. My Champion is growing nearer retiring. When he decides to give up his position…\" \"You would bypass by Melor for his brother? His younger brother ?\" The tone of his voice made me turn to him again. \"If Tristan is the better, then should I not?\" He hissed softly through his teeth. \"Take care, cousin. Beware of favouritism.\" Surprised I said, \"I have no favourites.\" He raised an eyebrow. \"He is younger, yes; but he is venturesome, with such courage, he has such skill with weapons. At his age, and with this, he has gaiety, so much charm. He has the gift of music; he sings and plays, he dances.\" \"And you think that Melor has not?\" \"No, of course not, Mordred! Melor too, has all these. They both shine so ... at almost everything. Well, perhaps I am a little closer to Tristan, but I have never treated them differently.\" \"You may not think so. But does Melor? Brothers can be jealous. Who knows better than I?\" I eyed him, weighing up his words. Then a shout from the yard as Tristan tripped and fell, his brother's blade at his throat in a second, Melor yelling in triumph. I laughed again at them and dismissed Mordred's comments from my mind. \"Come,\" I said. \"Let us ride out together.\" My spirits were always lighter when I was with Mordred. He, like Tristan, had a gaiety and a vivacity that lifted my heart, though I knew of old that the black dog often sat on his shoulder. It would not have been expected that Mordred, son of the High King, possessed of a bright beauty, with charm and intelligence, a fine and honourable knight, would sink into these dark moods, but I knew that these came on my cousin and had done so since he was a young child. As a child he could not escape them but now as a man, he took horse and fled Arthur's court as if the hounds of hell came after him. And, he came to where he was accepted for who he was, not for what his father was. He came to Kernow. And I, damaged too, though differently, would receive him with warmth and pleasure. We would practice our swordcraft, tilting, measuring our skills against each other; I would ride over my Kingdom with him till we were exhausted; we would discuss Kernow's new defences, growing stronger daily. We would talk politics, drink until we lightened into laughter, at ease with each other as only men who had been boys together, can be. Until he had had enough cider in him for me to ask, as I always did, \"What is it, Mordred?\" He would sit silently, as he always did, until he was ready to shed the pain that had driven him to Castle D'Or; the insults delivered behind his father's back, the slurs from companions of the court, the knife in the back by men he liked and trusted, the jealousy that trod behind him at Arthur's court. And always there, rarely talked about, like black shadows over him, the two women who, no matter how often he left , pulled him back with invisible threads . One, forbidden fruit, the other rotten fruit. One, his father's wife. Guinevere, the Queen. Guinevere, who had spun her web around him when he was a boy; as she might have done to me, had it not been for the watchful eyes of my mother and Merlin. The other, his mother. Morgause, Queen of Orkney. Imprisoned, in luxury maybe but imprisoned none the less, by his father's command. Mordred's trouble was that he did not know whether he loved his mother or hated her. It was of a certainty that he feared her. . We rode out over Kernow, examining my defences against the Irish raiders, to stand on the cliffs overlooking the Sabrina estuary, its waters glittering in the early summer sun. \"Yes, the raids are less. But when they come, they come to unexpected places and they are severe. They burn the crops and the orchards; they cripple the horses, even the farm horses….They wait until new forts are further grown and they come again.\" \"Hmm. Do not your beacons help?\" \"Oh, yes but they have come to choose the weather. Not to be seen, they come out of the mists or they sail up the middle of the channels where they cannot be seen from our shores, then turn back and attack from a different direction.\" \"And Castle D'Or?\" I smiled. \"No! They will never breach Castle D'Or. Its defences are now too great and growing stronger each day .\" \"Do not be complacent, cousin. \" Merlin planned Castle D'Or! It will only fall through treachery.\" He gathered his horse's reins. \"Perhaps you should wed Diarmud's daughter. Sue for terms?\" \"Christos, Mordred! Are we back on that old tack? Did your father send you?\" \"No! My father has never mentioned your marriage … or mine for that matter.\" \"Anyway, the Irish girl. Is she not still a child? I am too old to wed a babe.\" \"Children grow.\" I made a contemptuous sound. \"Sweet Goddess, Marke! What age are you now? I am almost six and twenty …so you must be four …five and twenty? Are you going to be celibate for the rest of your life?\" \"You do know not that I am.\" \"I know you, cousin. You are celibate until the need and loneliness drives you to seek some-one, anybody. \" I could feel the anger rising in me. \"You should marry, Marke! You are the sort of a man who needs a wife.\" \"Enough!\" And Mordred knew when to stop. .~*~ \"And the King, how is he?\" We had retired to my privy Chamber after supper. Tomas, my body servant, had stoked the brazier with its charcoal; it gave out a comfortable glow and with the night candle, just enough light. He brought a jug of wine and I dismissed him. I poured two goblets, handed Mordred one, and taking the other, sat beside the brazier . Mordred turned to look at Tramor standing back in the shadows by the door. He raised his brows, jerking his head towards him. \"I would trust Tramor with my life.\" I murmured. \"Even so?\" I nodded. He joined me at last, taking his time to answer . \"He is weary. There are younger knights coming to court. Older ones who are beginning to think …I do not know, Marke.\" He shrugged. \"My father's ideals of Grace, Glory and Honour , of Right for All, seems to be fading or at least tarnishing at the edges.\" He put his cup to his lips, and then put it down without drinking. \"When he is at court, he pulls everything together, everything shines; but when he has to leave ….. When the Angles raid or the Danes or even….. when he is not there, everything seems to fall apart…\" A long pause. \"And then there is Mother.\" He stopped again. \"She sends for us; for me , my brothers. She works on us to persuade my father to allow her to come to court.\" Startled, I said \"You would not?\" \"I am sorry for her but no, I will not, nor Gawain; but the twins and Gareth, she easily manipulates them….\" He picked up his goblet again and drained it. \"I am going to bed. Goodnight.\" I sat silently in the guttering candle light. Until I was sure he was gone. \"Do you hear that?\" \"Yes, Lord.\" \"What think you?\" In the last few years Tramor had risen through the ranks of my body guard and he had become close to me, a sounding board for my thoughts. Never once had he crossed the line between King and subject. I trusted him and I knew if I asked him aught, I would get an honest answer. I gestured to the chair that Mordred had sat in. Tramor hesitated and then joined me. It was not the first time he had sat with me but rare. He knew that I wished to speak him so that we would not be overheard, but he always wished to be certain. \"It would be best if the High King did not leave court.\" \"We both know that is not possible.\" He lowered his voice further. \"The Queen of Orkney makes trouble if she can.\" \"Hmm.\" \"The court needs a firm hand.\" He leaned forward resting his elbows on his knees, as I did. \"Lord, there is talk.\" \"There is always talk.\" \"Yes! But \" I nodded for him to continue. \"Much talk about my Lady the Queen, and the Lord Lancelot.\" \"There has been talk for some time.\" \"Yes Lord, outside Camelot but it begins to be whispered at court.\" \"Sweet Jesu!\" I leaned back in my chair, resting my mouth against my fist, thinking. \"Lord, the Prince Mordred, think you he knows?\" Our eyes met. \"You know about the Prince?\" \"Lord, how not?\" \"No, no Tramor, I think not. It would be a brave man who would speak so of the Queen to Mordred.\" \"He does not see?\" \"He will not see; he is blind to failings in the ones he loves.\" \"My Lord? The King?\" \"Ah! The King.\" I thought. \"Tramor, I think the King has known from the start. Unlike Mordred, the King is far from blind, but he is understanding of the needs of the two people he loves most in the world. \" He thought about my words \"Maybe not wise.\" I sighed, a deep long breath. \"Maybe not wise in some ways, but a good and loving man.\" I stood. \"It is late; to your bed now.\" \"Goodnight, my Lord.\" \"Good night.\" . .~~*~~ The preparations for Melor's knighthood together with three other boys began. My pledged lords began to gather. We met together to discuss the novitiates. After some thought, I had made a decision and spoke of it to several of my older counsellors, sitting around the table. Tramor stood as ever, at the rear of the room. \"My lords, there is a man whom I intend to knight with the others. One who is well deserving of knight hood. He has more than earned his sword and spurs. This is within my gift, without your sanction, but, for him and for him alone, I wish to have your spoken assent. He is Tramor.\" Silence, then the response came from my lords \"Aye. Aye .\" There was no hesitation in their support. The astonishment on his face was amusing. He looked around, hesitated then came fast up the length of the table to kneel before me. \"My Lord … my Lord…I am of common stock… I am not worthy ...\" His voice broke; he bent his head to hide the emotion there. \"Tramor, there is no man more deserving.\" He put his hands together and held them up to me in the traditional manner of swearing allegiance; I clasped them in mine and raised him to his feet. \"You will remain in the King's Guards?\" His surprise made him stammer, \" But, but ... where else would I go, Lord? My place is at your side.\" . .~~*~~*~~ The High King invited me to Camelot to present the newly knighted Melor to him and when spring weather began to slide into Summer, I decided take him and Gwennith his mother, to court. Gwenny was bubbling with excitement. \"You are like a small child,\" I said to her. \"You forget how many years it is since I have been to Camelot. And I will see my son swear his allegiance to the High King.\" I smiled. \"Two years and you will see your other son do the same.\" \"Mmmm.\" She frowned a little. \"That young man had better improve his ways.\" I knew what she was referring to. When I decided to take Melor to Camelot, his mother with him, Tristan thought he should come too. Gwennith thought not. I spoke to her in private about this. \"I will gladly take him with us, Gwenny.\" \"No, Marke! It is Melor's time.\" She bit her lip. \"You know how it is, Marke. Whether he intends it or not, he steals Melor's glory. No, he will have his turn. This is for Melor.\" Tristan thought otherwise. He threw a fit of tantrums demanding to come, which surprised both his mother and me. He treated his mother to sulks and sullens for days, distressing and hurting her until I spoke sharply to him. . . ~~*~~ The glitter of the presentation of the new young knights to the High King was as impressive as ever and the swearing of the oath of allegiance moved my sister to tears. It was later at the evening feast that I found how much Camelot was changing. Arthur looked tired and worn, his bright gold hair dulling with grey , his dark gold beard glinting with silver. The Queen sat beside him, a little bored, I thought. A little younger than Arthur , her beauty was as yet undimmed. Lancelot sitting at the table below the dais, looked sad and weary. It was growing noisy. Arthur stood and took Guinevere's hand to lead her out of the great hall. The court rose and some of the older lords fell in behind them to follow them out of the hall. Lancelot resumed his seat, looking down into his goblet. The younger lords sat again to refill their cups. Arthur's hospitality as ever had been bountiful, and ale and wine were overflowing. Overflowing was right; unwanted food was tossed carelessly to the floor, and as much drink was spilt as was drunk . Nothing was cleared. Gwennith wrinkled her nose in distaste as she looked around her. \"By Heaven, if these servants were mine, I would make them jump.\" She tightened her lips. \"A poor mistress make a poor servant.\" The night became raucous and coarse as drink flowed. Heads together, whispers first and glances up at the top of the table led to sniggers. The wall torches were beginning to gutter and smoke but no servants came to trim them. King Pellinore, he who had been Merlin's closest crony and was Arthur's oldest friend, paused beside me. \"Do you stay, Marke?\" \"I think not, Pellinore.\" I gestured at Melor whose round eyes were everywhere. \"Very wise.\" He was old when first I was at court but then, if forgetful, he was always upright and vital; now suddenly he looked very old, old and bent and weary. He nodded at the younger knights, his own son Lamorak, amongst them... \"Get the lad away from these…..\"He grimaced, flicking his hand down table. \"before they start talking treason.\" Startled, my eyes met his, mine querying; his, confirming my glance, roamed the room. \" Then perhaps it would be better if I stayed.\" \"No, lad. Go you home and soon; but be prepared for the times to come.\" Our eyes met again. He shrugged. \"I know not whence it comes but it comes.\" He patted my shoulder and made his way down the hall. I turned to Gwennith. \"Come, it is time for us to get Melor out of here.\" Her look was troubled. \"I will take him, if you wish to stay.\" \"No.\" I said. \"I do not wish to stay. There is a smell of corruption here.\" Tramor stood at my chamber door. As I passed him, I told him to leave word to have Dark Star ready at early light. \"I wish to ride.\" . .~~*~~ I slept little that night but when I crossed the stable yard the next morning, he was waiting there, holding Dark Star and his bay. I dismissed him. \"But Lord \" \"I wish to ride alone, Tramor.\" \"Lord, you are not armed. You need …\" I raised my eyebrows. I saw the look on his face, of concern and exasperation; he would have argued with me if he had dared. I raised my hand to silence him. I smiled ruefully at him and shook my head and left him looking doubtfully after me. I gave Dark Star his head and he lengthened his stride and together we fled Camelot's constricting airs …both exhilarated at loosing our pent up energy. Out! Across the plain, through the echoing eerie gorge at Cheddar, until at last we both slowed and I turned his head back towards Arthur's city. Without thinking, I guided him past the outer curtain wall, bearing westwards until we cantered into the courtyard at Applegarth. Since I had been last there, she had taken an older couple to help her; the wife in the house, the man in the gardens and orchards that gave Applegarth its name. They stood together, gaping at me. \"The Lady Viviane?\" I asked, leaning down to them. Still they gawped. \"Your mistress, where is she?\" Surely she had not taken on simpletons? I was irritated by their dropped jaws and open mouths until I realised that they were staring at my jerkin, at the two badges high on my shoulder; the black horse of Cunomorus rearing next to the scarlet dragon of Pendragon. The badges of two Royal Houses. I spoke more softly, \"Your Lady?\" Without taking their eyes from me, they pointed through the wicker gate that lead to the kitchen gardens and through them to the inner apple orchard. I tossed the man my reins and throwing my leg over Dark Star's neck, I slid to the ground , and dropping my leather jerkin into the woman's hands, I went to find her . Through the herb and vegetable gardens I went , looking till I saw her beyond the low dry stone wall, kneeling at the foot of an apple tree, working in its soil. I moved fast and reaching up, I used a low bough to swing over the wall and stood looking down at her. She crouched startled, at my feet and made to stand, so close to the tree trunk that its rough bark caught her shift and pulled it off one shoulder and taut across her breast. She had been working in the sun; her skin gleamed with the warmth of it, the copper strands of her hair stuck to her throat and face, and tiny pearls of perspiration outlined her mouth. Her breath was coming fast, her breasts rising and falling but her eyes met mine and held. I still held on to the branch as I bent my head to find her mouth. Her hands went to my hair, twisting it, holding my head fast. The bough swished through the air as I let it go to tug at her shift , to touch her, feel her skin and pull her down under me. . We said nothing even when we were done. I stood, and reached my hand to help her up and swing her over the low wall. She led us back through the gardens, the scent of the herbs, warmed by the late morning sun, was rising now and filling the air. I was only a step behind her as we entered the kitchen. \"Refreshment for the King, Marged.\" she said to the woman, kicking off her work clogs that were heavy with soil. She must have had it ready for when we passed through the atrium into the bedchamber, I was surprised at a sound behind me. I turned, the crone was putting a tray down on a table. Bread and Cheddar's rich gold cheese on a wooden platter, apples in a bowl and a jug of ale. I wondered if the old biddy had noticed the earth and grass stains on us. Her eyes met mine, and she wasn't as old as I thought; she had merely lost her teeth. Her tongue slipped between her lips and her eyes sparkled naughtily at me. Oh, she had missed nothing. \"Lord.\" She bobbed and left us. Viviane loosed the string of her skirt and petticoats and let them fall to step out of them. I heeled off my boots, watching her. She stepped up to the table in her shift, chose an apple and tossing it in one hand, moved to the great bed. Kneeling up on it, looking at me, she tossed the apple again and bit into it. And held it out to me. Jesu, I thought. Eve in the Garden, and I could not stop myself casting my eyes about to see if the serpent was slithering around somewhere. Like Adam, I could not but take the apple from her. Like him, and her, I took a bite and turning threw it back into the bowl, and slowly and deliberately pulled off my shirt and dropped my breeches. I curled my arm around her shoulders and swept her up into the bed with me to her soft giggles. . The noonday sun had moved around the chamber. Now it streamed through the small window to light the slight swell of her belly. I watched my fingers drift slowly on its faint fine apricot down. Her eyes were closed though she was not asleep. I ran my finger up and circled her navel. A soft quivering laugh bubbled from her. \"Do ye want more?\" \"Are ye game?\" A mocking hiccup of laughter. \"You said once, that you did not desire me.\" \"I lied.\" I paused. \"Did you?\" She was silent. \"What mean you?\" I chose my words carefully. \"You said . . . you said that you had had only two lovers. Merlin was virgin; this I know to be so. He himself told me. It follows that Lord Pelleas is knowledgeable. Or . . .\" She was highly amused. \"I have had two lovers . . . three now. You, my lord King, Lord Pelleas, and Prince Merlin; and yes, Merlin was virgin.\" I heard her in my mind, remembering \" Oh there, my lord, and there! How like you this, my king? And this? This pleasures you?\" and my own gasping\" Yes, Yes.\" \"Then you, Lady, are more knowledgeable than I should have expected.\" She laughed again, this time a little mocking. \"Merlin was virgin,\" she said again. \"But he was a physician; he had travelled much in the East and along the Silk Road. He talked with their doctors and wise men and learnt much from them. He had many books too, from distant countries. We read them together and put them into practice.\" \"Books?\" I said, astonished. A burble of laughter from her. \"Books. There is much to be learned from books, my King. There is one in particular, from the Far East; from the Hindu Kush. Khmh Sootrh. The Book of Erotic Pleasure. Erotic Pleasure indeed! \" She laughed again; her head tossed back, her throat arched, her teeth gleaming pearls.. \"Prince Merlin was old but he was adventurous.\" \"And did you practice your book with Lord Pelleas?\" Even to me, my tone was cool. \"Lord Pelleas is . . . vigorous but unadventurous. You, my King, are . . . both vigorous and adventurous.\" She was smiling. After a moment, I relented and smiled wryly. \"My cousin would not agree; he calls me his little monk.\" \"Your cousin? The Prince Mordred? And he is expert? \" She was tart. \"He means only that I should marry again.\" \"Perhaps he should take his own advice.\" Throughout this exchange, I had not looked at her. She put both hands to my head and turned me to her. \"Come, my Lord King, let us once more prove the Prince wrong.\" . She pulled on her shift and poured us both cups of ale. She offered me one and swinging herself back onto the bed beside me, she said, \"What brought you here, Marke? You did not come for this alone.\" A little ruefully, I said, \"I didn't know that I was coming here until I rode in to the courtyard.\" She waited. I reached for my breeches. \"When were you last at court?\" I asked slowly, pulling them on. \"Two moons, I suppose.\" I sat on the side of the bed holding my shirt, wondering what I wanted to say. \"You may trust me, Marke.\" I gnawed at my lip.\" Yes. Yes, I should not be here if I thought otherwise. I had thought that you would be there. At the court... Merlin was there always. But you must know that. \" Still I hesitated. I pulled on my shirt. \"You must know how it is there.\" \"The Queen? And Lord Lancelot? I dragged my hand through my hair. \"Aye ….and the King's Companions.\" \"The King has much to do. Attacks on all sides. He is away much of the time.\" \"Aye,\" I said on a sigh. \"It would be better if more of his Companions rode with him instead of spreading gossip when they are in their cups. Do you not advise the King?\" \"I am not the King's cousin; I may only advise when asked. Or when the Lady sends me.\" She tied her petticoats about her. \"The air at court, Viviane. I do not like it. It smacks of rottenness, decay. When Arthur is present, it is as though it lies hidden, but simmering beneath. \" I paused. \"You have no knowledge of what is to be?\" \"The Goddess sends what she will.\" She stopped.\"This I know and I have told the High King; the Kingdom is safe for now. There is darkness coming, and heavy times. Heavy times for King and subject but there will be a safe pair of hands to hold the Kingdom after him, for a few more years. But the Darkness is coming. There can be no holding it back. There will be hard times for the Kingdom, but it will be not fall in his lifetime, nor yours. \" . .~*~*~ It was mid-afternoon before I made move to return to Camelot. Viviane called to her man to saddle my horse. We walked together through the cool atrium to the vestibule. I picked up my jerkin from the chair where Marged had left it; she had brushed it well. \"Will you come again?\" \"If I can.\" \"Soon?\" \" Perhaps. I cannot say surely.\" I trusted her now, this I knew ; and liked her, yes, and of a certainty, desired her but I did not love her. I thought perhaps she thought the same. I might want to come again. But if I should? This I did not know. . I moved to the door. A thought came to me, I caught my breath. I turned to her. \"Will there be a child?\" \"That is in the hands of the Goddess.\" \"You do not 'see'?\" \"I do not have the Sight. I can read a little in the water and in the fire, Merlin taught me that; and sometimes the Lady Goddess sends a sign but always for others. Never for myself.\" \"You will send me word should...?\" She smiled. \"Of course.\" She came out of the shadows to where I stood on the step in the sunlight and put her hand on my arm. \"Marke. It would be good for you and Kernow if you were to marry.\" \"Perhaps.\" I had stopped to buckle my jerkin, when she spoke oddly. \"From under Erin's shadows Through smoke and fire Gold, sapphires and roses, For Kernow's King.\" I gaped at her. Her face was white against the copper of her hair and a little tremor shook her, her eyelids flickering fast as if she were awakening. She took deep shuddering breaths, her eyes steadying to fix on me. \"What said I, my Lord?\" She took a quick breath and smiled uncertainly. I held her chin to kiss her mouth gently. \"You said nothing, my lady, only farewell. May Christos keep you in His care.\" At Camelot that evening, I told Arthur of my resolve to return home. He smiled sadly but neither questioned my decision nor my reasons. I held out my hands to take his. \"In faith and truth I will bear unto thee…\" The first line of the vow of allegiance. \"Always, my King.\" . .~~~*~~~*~~~ We came back to Castle D'Or to find Tristan returned to his sunny self. It was as if his sulks and tantrums were put behind him. He set himself to prepare himself for his Knighthood, striving as always to his utmost. I rode with him and Melor daily; sometimes just for the pleasure, other times out across the land to the villages, teaching them the care of the people as my father had taught me. They sat below me on the dais, in my great hall, in my judgements, that they might learn as I did; as I had learnt from my father, Arthur and Merlin, what is just and right. Melor has lands in Breidzh from his father; he would not always stay in Kernow. He would need to know how to care for them. And Tristan too, though as a younger son his were much less … maybe he one day might need that knowledge too. My love and pride in them grew daily. If there were jealousy between brothers, I did not see it. I saw only arguing and squabbling between loving brothers, striving to beat each other. If sometimes, my sister frowned a little when she looked at her sons, that also was something of which I was not aware. Perhaps I should have been. Tristan was knighted just after his fifteenth birthday. In the days that followed, Irish raids began again. Fiercer and more deadly than ever, the devastation of the villages where they landed was appalling. So fierce were the attacks that though Tristan was initiated a knight, there was no time after for the days of honour, that were his due. As soon as we heard the warning horn, my lords and I were mounted and gone, Melor and Tristan wanting to be at my side. My sister's eyes mutely begging me to leave them behind. I knew I could not continue to do so much longer, for their sakes. The tournament circuit in France had recommenced. I gave Melor my permission to go to compete in them again, as I had in the two previous years. He had done well and itched to do so again. And Tristan too itched to go with him. His mother was reluctant. \"Gwenny, he will gain experience and confidence with less danger than fighting against the Irish and Melor will be safe too without feeling shame.\" So we let them go. . .~~*~~ Word came to us that King Diarmud had appointed a new Morholt, the King's Champion. Connor, a brilliant soldier, but a hard and cruel one, relentless in his greed, remorseless in his slaying. Our days were filled, riding across our land, looking to building new more beacons, setting more watches, rebuilding the villages, making sure that my people had food and seed for their plantings. My nephews returned from France: Melor smiling with his triumph in the field, a man now with little trace of the boy, and Tristan, he too had grown, not only in stature but in the knightly fields, bidding well to be the best amongst men, the finest in my Kingdom, shining at swordcraft , horsemanship, tilting , everything that makes a perfect knight , but still a boy , not yet seventeen. My lords came to Castle D'Or when the first gales of winter lashed our shores, when they were sure that their castles were safe from the Irish marauders. Some had been very badly damaged by the raids and they all wanted an end to it. The discussions always becoming heated; the suggestions as to what we should do were wild and varied. Two most favoured were firstly that we should send spying raids to Erin to sound out their strengths: and secondly, that I should marry into a strong alliance. A political alliance. With Erin. I agreed that throughout the winter we should discuss spying raids; on the other I made no comment. I was aware that my lords took that as a tacit agreement. With the passing of the Christos ' birth feast, we began to plan a spy raid. Gathering together all our knowledge, all that we knew about the geography of the Irish coast, about Tara, King Diarmud's stronghold: about his military strength and about the Morholt with whose name Kernowish mothers now threatened their children. We discussed long and hard; the kind of the boats we had, which was best for what we intended: our young men, the skills they would need for this hazardous trip. And at last, with my lords, I made the decision that yes, there should be a raid when everything was ready. How many should go and…who. We had decided. A small party would lessen discovery . Four we thought. Those most skilled in moving quietly and without attracting attention. They were to be clad not in armour but in coarse woollens to appear to be fishermen, no arms except knives. My lords and I narrowed the numbers and then we chose the four who were to go. Melor and Tristan begged to be allowed to go. I refused them. Melor accepted my word as he always did; not because he was afraid but because he customarily obeyed my word immediately. Tristan, however, was wild to go. He persisted until I snapped at him. The party was ready. . .~~*~~ They left one night, unbeknown to the court. No moon, they rode quietly in the dark, down to one of the creeks below the western cliffs; climbing silently down to the small boat already hidden there, and they were gone. All was quiet until the morning found the court in uproar and Tristan missing. Gwennith sought me in tears. \"Did you let him go?\" \"Of course not! Gwennith, he is out, riding off his sullens. He will be back when he is hungry.\" He did not come back. I sent a couple of soldiers out to look for him. \" Marke, you did not let him go to Erin? \" \"Gwenny, you know I expressly said no. Besides, they would not take him against my command.\" Concerned, I sent out search parties. We scoured the land around the castle, every village, every cove, every dell, every bloody rabbit hole. Wherever Tristan was, he was nowhere near Castle D'Or. Gwennith's distress caused me to give out word to the youngsters of the court that if any knew even the smallest hint of where he might be, then they should come to me. There would be no repercussions. Melor came to me. He was white and fraught, biting his lip. He knelt before me, looking at his mother. \"My Lord King, my Lord Uncle…\" \"If you know something, Melor, then you must tell us. For your mother's sake. And your brother's.\" He licked his lips. \"He said… I told him not to be stupid.\" He looked at his mother again. \"He called me coward. I did not think that he ….\" \"He said he would go with them, the spy raid ...stow away, to Erin.\" \"You knew! Ahhrhh! And you did not stop him.\" She leapt at him and smacked him hard across the head, pummelling and punching him; and kneeling still, he took it. \"Gwennith!\" I pulled her from him, holding her. \"How could the boy stop him?\" She clutched my arm. \"What can we do?\" \"Nothing!\" \"Send to Erin! Marke! Send and ask Diarmud….\" Her voice trailed off. \"I cannot. Not only would it risk his life, it would betray the others. If Diarmud has him or any of them, he will send word fast enough. No, Gwenny, we have to sit and wait.\" That is what we did, Melor growing as white as his mother, and she growing thinner daily. No word came from Diarmud. More than thirty days without word. On the thirty first day, came the sound of raised voices, feet running fast. \"My Lord,\" Up the stone stairs to my chamber. \" My Lord\" One of the guards came running; behind him another man, not a soldier, more meanly clothed. He clutched the door jamb, gasping for breath. \"My Lord,\" the guard said. \"this man, he has news. News of Lord Tristan.\" \"A stool for him, quickly, man, and fetch the Lady Gwennith and Lord Melor.\" I poured a mug of ale. \"Sit you, and here.\" I held out the mug and waited for him to catch his breath.\"Take your time, man.\" \"Your name? Where are you from? \" \"Jacca. Mullion cove.\" His breathing was easier now. My sister rushed in, Melor behind her. \"Now man, tell us what you know.\" \"Boy in a boat, came into thur cove on thur tide. Yestiddy, naw, day 'fore. Drifting in nor sailing. He wuz lying in it, worn and sickly. Oi got 'im out. Worn out, 'e wuz. Sed send word to the King. Tell 'im, tell you… Tristan. Oi be feart to pass message on, so Oi came me sel'. Oi canna ride so Jory brought me pillion. Oi begs pardon Lord, Jory's 'oss be ole farm 'oss and two of us be hard for him. We came as fast as we could.\" I nodded in understanding. \"The boy, Tristan?\" \"My woman be taking care of him.\" Gwennith knelt beside him. \"You are certain that it is he? Tristan?\" \" 'Tis whut 'e sed.\" He looked up. His eyes widened and his jaw dropped at the sight of her but my sister has been stunning men with her beauty since she was little more that a child. \"This is my sister, the Lady Gwennith, Jacca, and Tristan's mother.\" \"Aye, 'e 'as a look of 'er. Pardon, me lady.\" She smiled at him adding more to his confusion. \"Tell me, Jacca, how is he? Where has he been?\" \"Oi doan know where he been. 'e din say. Oi think that be for the King. Me mizzuz sez 'e be fine; naw Oi thinks he been poorly and be worn out. Sailing singly wears you out. No sleep, you see. Some sleep 'n he be fine. Me missuz sez, um, she washed him, she sez there be a great gash, up 'ere, up his thigh into 'is groin. It be mostly healed now.\" Gwennith looked up at me, her distress on her face. \"Me missuz sez, it were well looked after, but he musta bin fair poorly for a while.\" \"Marke, we must go.\" \"Lady. We be fisherfolk, our cots be a mite rough for ladies, and by now the lad will be on 'is way 'ere. 'e be 'ere before you know. Best to bide 'ere. Um, pardon, Lady.\" She stood, nodding.\" You'll be needing food and drink. I'll see to it. Thank you, Jacca.\" I went to the small chest on my table. \"This for your trouble.\"I said and held out a small bag of gold. He drew himself up. \"Oi needs no gelt for helping a lad.\" \"Nevertheless you will take it. It is a command.\" I touched his shoulder, \"And should you ever want for anything, remember, your King is in your debt.\" . . ~*~ Two days later Tristan was home. A little pale and with an almost healed scar of which he was inordinately proud. I sent for him to come to my Privy Chamber, his mother waiting with me. I had recovered from my fright of losing him, enough to be angry at him. He knelt before me, barely hiding a smile. \"You are amused, Tristan? I assure you, you have nothing to be amused or pleased with yourself about.\" The smile dropped. \"Your mother was distressed and extremely worried about you; as was I. Apart from which you deliberately flouted my command.\" His eyes slid to his mother and back to me. I was not going to let my concern and relief deflate my anger at his flouting my orders. \"You defied me. And by doing so you put your life at risk, not to mention the lives of the men sent on the mission; and the men who spent days, searching the moors of the Kingdom for you. \" His mouth opened in consternation and not a little fear. Good! I intended to put the fear of God in him. \"Being a Knight of the Realm is not just a shining armour and a good horse; it is not just being a fine swordsman and able with a lance. It is caring for your people, being considerate of your dear ones. More, it is thinking of the safety of your companions. Above all, it is obeying commands of your King and not seeking self glory.\" I had not raised my voice but the tone of it was cold; as I had intended. Tristan had to learn that trust and loyalty to one's brothers -in-arms and them in you was essential. That obeying your Lord's command was as a part of knighthood as the sword in your hand; and the honour of it was as easily tarnished. \"I am deeply disappointed in you.\" He bit his lip and I felt rather than saw my sister bow her head in distress. \"My Lord King, I am sorry. I beg your pardon with all my being… I desperately wanted to go; to do what I could for you and my country…\" His voice trailed away. \"I do not think that you understand even now, Tristan , that you, by your youth and inexperience, by your disobedience , could have lost the expedition, even lost the lives of your companions.\" I stopped as I saw his face change. \"They are lost? How many? Tell me.\" \"My Lord … … I don't know surely …\" \"Tell me what you do know.\" He began slowly. How one day out at sea, he had revealed himself. The four knights had been angry and accused him of jeopardising it but all had agreed that it would be wiser to go on. They had landed on the western coast of Erin and had hidden the boat. They had closed in on the castle that he later had learnt to be Tara, Diarmud's seat. They were discovered and ambushed. The others had urged him to run, he had stayed and four of them had fallen and one captured. The Irish had left the fallen for dead. The three others were dead, but he managed to get back to the boat. He was bleeding badly. He had managed to launch the boat but had fainted and the boat drifted out. He had woken some time later in a fisherman's hut; his wounds being tended by two maidens. \"Their mother worked in the stillroom of the palace so they had some skills. They fed me too and when the search for me began again, they got me away.\" \"Why?\" \"Why?\" He shrugged.\"They hated the Morholt … and I think, the King ... I think Irish mothers frighten their babies with stories of the Morholt too.\" \"And your captured companion?\" He shook his head. \"I do not know, Lord. I could not question the maidens for fear of giving myself away. I do not think there is much hope.\" So this trip had been a disaster from start to finish. \"Do you know, did they learn anything? Again he shook his head, biting his lip. I rested my head on my hands. Dearest Christos, I sent these men to their deaths. All for nothing; a waste of lives. \"My Lord. Uncle, I am sorry.\" I stood and walked away to the window embrasure, looking out without seeing. \"Lord Uncle.\" The still boyish voice broke through and I turned. Yes, he was still a boy. \"I am truly sorry…\" \"It is not you who are to blame, Tristan. Perhaps you should not have gone but I let them go. I sent them to their deaths.\" \"Lord, men fight and die, each and every battle. That is the nature of being a soldier.\" The earnest young face looked up at me. \"Fighting in battle, armoured and armed, all equal, is not the same as sending men unarmed into enemy lands.\" \"Lord, Kings give commands and men die; that is the nature of being a commander.\" \"Aye Tristan, but it does not make it right or easier on that King's conscience.\" I turned back to him and raised him to his feet. \"Learn by this Tristan. It is not an adventure; it is life and men may lose their lives. You are now a knight and have ideals to live up to. Honour and justice for all. When you ignore or disobey your Lord, it is not only your honour you tarnish, it is his also.\" . .~~~~*~~~~ In the months that followed, the Irish raids were even fiercer, their lightning strikes causing severe life losses mostly among the villagers and field workers. I saw both Melor and Tristan grow in stature, both striving to be the finest they could. My pride in both of them grew with them, and when my Champion wished to retire from his position, I appointed Tristan to it. Melor spoke privily about it to me, hurt and disappointed. I gave my reason; he held lands and people in trust to me. But it was also true and unsaid that Tristan was better, not much but better still. If my joy in them gave me pleasure, it was in my bedchamber alone at night, that faces of the dead and names of the living rose to reproach me. As the autumn mists rose, my lords came to hold council with me. More and more, the suggestion of a political alliance was raised. In my chamber, more and more, the thoughts came back to me. Were they right? Would an alliance help to protect my people? Was I being selfish, in standing back from a political marriage? Could I, for what may be the best of reasons, marry a child? I was then eight and twenty. Mature, yes and some might say, beginning to slide into middle-age. A child! It filled me with distaste. Or was it the thought of what I had with Drawenna. As I did when in doubt, I opened my mind to think what she might think. More and more I heard her say \" Look to your people, Marke .\" I sent for Tristan. \"The Princess of Ireland...Did you see her?\" He shook his head. \"No, Lord.\" \"Did you hear of her?\" \"Very little, Lord. The maid who tended me laughed and said only that she was a plain little thing.\" \"What age has she? She is very young, still a child surely?\" \"I do not know her age , my lord, except she is marriageable. Fifteen perhaps, or sixteen. The Morholt sues for her hand. Some say that Diarmud will give her to him for his services to the throne. Others think that Diarmud would not give his only child, the Princess of Erin, to his Champion but is saving her for higher offers while keeping the Morholt tied to him.\" . .~~*~~ With the end of winter days, after more council with my lords, I made my decision. I would send an embassage seeking peace and requesting the hand of the Princess Iseult, as surety of my good faith. I would send my Herald as my Ambassador, several of my highest diplomatic Lords, and Tristan as the King's Champion. My Lords knew every detail of my suit and were to act as I would. A sign of diplomacy, fully and completely drawn up, and a show of strength to enforce any agreement. No! I did not trust Diarmud or his Morholt. My largest ship was loaded with gifts for the King and the Princess, my Lords boarded her and I stood on the cliffs beyond Castle D'Or and watched her sail down the Channel to Erin. The dice were tossed. They would fall where they would. . .~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~~*~~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~*~~~ ","Summary":" And walk in dreams and darkness This is the fourth part of Marke's story.

She wished she could go and play with them but her parents had told her she couldn't. It wasn't lady like to get dirty like the boys. She was only ten. Why she had to act like a lady at such a young age she didn't understand, but that was what her parents believed. Simon and Melot waved at her as they went deeper into the trees. They knew how bad she wanted to play with them. But they had gotten into big trouble the last time they snuck her away. She was one girl they didn't mind having around. She didn't act like the other girls her age. She wasn't giggly and didn't mind getting a little dirty. But her parents refused to let her play with them none the less. \"Roana, why don't you go play with Arian? Or one of the other girls?\" Her father asked as he sat down beside her. \"There are plenty of girls your age to play with.\" Roana shook her head sadly. \"They don't like me. They say I smell like the boys.\" Her father sighed and looked over his shoulder at his wife. They hated to see their daughter so alone and upset. His wife nodded and he turned his attention back to Roana. \"If you promise to not ruin your clothes, you may go play with Simon and his friends. \" Roana gave her father a hug and got to her feet. Before her parents could head another warning about her clothes she was running towards the trees. Her father stood up and watched her happily run off. \"Do you think we have made the right decision?\" His wife asked. \"Will Roana be a prized wife some day?\" He took his wife's hand and lightly kissed it. \"She will. She is a beauty already. The young men in this village would have to be blind not to notice.\" \"But no man will want a woman that doesn't know how to take care of him or a family.\" she said sadly as she walked back into her house. \"Roana!\" Simon said shaking his sister awake. The moment her eyes opened he grabbed her hand and pulled her out of bed. \"Simon, what is the rush?\" Roana asked angrily. She was not one to be woken so suddenly. \"Simon tell me!\" Simon turned towards her with frightened eyes. \"the Irish are here. They are burning the village.\" \"Mother and Father?\" Roana said worriedly. \"They were visiting Edtyh. They will be safe.\" Simon said as he lead his sister into the trees. He sat her down in some brush and sat down next to her. \"Now keep quiet Roana. We must keep quiet.\" Roana hid her face in her brother's shirt and tried to ignore the horrific sounds coming from her village. The screams of woman and children and the sound of metal against metal. This was going to haunt her dreams for years to come. \"Simon?\" a hushed voice called from farther in the trees. \"Roana? Is that you?\" \"Melot?\" Roana asked. Melot walked up to them and took Roana's hand. \"Come, both of you. It is safer back here.\" Roana let Melot lead her farther into the trees as her brother followed not far behind. \"Why do they do this?\" Roana asked as she tried to hold back tears. \"Why must they hate us?\" Melot looked down at her sadly. \"Because my Uncle and the rest of the Barrens are trying to sign a treaty tonight. To bring Britain together as one force. If the treaty happens, we out number the Irish greatly.\" \"Then I hope it happens.\" Roana demanded. \"I hope Marke kills them all!\" Melot smirked down at her then brought her down into a thick brush. Simon sat close by. He could see the village go up in flames. He looked over at his friend and sister to watch Melot bring her face into his chest. \"Close your eyes Roana.\" Melot whispered to her. \"Close your eyes from this horror. And know Simon and I shall keep you safe out here.\" Roana did as Melot said. She knew he was telling the truth. He and Simon would protect her, no matter the cost. Slowly sleep took over her. When she woke Melot was gone and Simon had taken his place. He looked like he had been crying. \"Where's Melot?\" Roana asked with a small yawn. It took a minute for her to recall the reasons she had been sleeping out side. She sat up at once and looked around. \"He's with his mother.\" Simon replied. \"Come on. We need to find father.\" Simon stood and took her hand in his. He slowly lead her to what used to be her home. But know it was nothing but a few chard boards that did not burn. Standing by the house was her father. His shoulders shook as he cried. Slowly he turned to his children and brought them into his arms. \"father? Why are you crying? Where's mother?\" Roana asked. Her father looked sadly at his daughter. \"She's gone.\" He replied. \"She had gone back to find you and got caught in the fire.\" Roana looked back at the house then over at Simon. \"We shouldn't have left Simon.\" Her father shook his head. \"If you hadn't, you would have suffered the same fate I am afraid.\" He looked over his shoulder and sighed deeply. Marke and some of his men had just returned to see the ruins of the village. \"Go find Melot. I need to talk to Marke.\" Simon took Roana's hand and lead her away to find Melot playing with some of the other boys. When he saw them he motioned them over. \"They took my father as well.\" He said looking down at a crying Roana. \"Marke will figure this out. Nothing stops my uncle.\" \"Melot! Melot!\" from a distance they could hear Edyth calling for him. Melot hurried to see what his mother wanted as the others followed not far behind. He was like the leader of all the children. Being Marke's nephew every one wanted to be his friend. As his mother came into sight Melot froze. There standing next to her was a boy around his age. \"Melot, this is Tristan.\" She said as tears fell from her eyes. \"He'll be staying with us.\" Roana took a step towards the boy, but Melot quickly grabbed her arm. He gave her a stern look and she fell back next to her brother. \"Why don't you take Tristan with you.\" Edyth said as she lightly pushed Tristan towards her son. \"He has lost much today.\" Slowly Tristan walked up to Melot but neither boy talked. As they walked away Melot turned towards him. \"What have you lost?\" he asked eyeing him. \"My parents.\" Tristan replied quietly. \"I lost my mother.\" Roana said taking the boys hand. \"Roana, don't you have something else to do?\" Melot asked grabbing her arm and pulling her away from Tristan. Roana looked up at Melot shocked. He had never treated her that way before. She took her arm away from him and walked away. She didn't understand why Melot had acted like that and he never did it again till she was much older. Nine Years Later \"Simon, have you seen Roana?\" Edyth asked annoyed with her hands on her hips and a stern look on her face. \"No, I haven't seen her all day. I thought she had gone to work.\" Simon said with a roll of his eyes. He should have known she wouldn't be at the castle. Marke had offered Simon and Roana a job working for him after their father had died the year before. Simon was always there, but Roana on the other hand only showed up when she felt like it. \"I swear if she is off with Melot or Tristan...\" Edyth trailed off. She was tired of hunting the girl down every day. She had better things to do with her time. \"She's not with Melot. I just saw him go into the castle.\" Simon said with a sigh. \"I'll go find her.\" Simon sighed as he walked towards the river. There were only a few places Roana ran off to. The river, and a clearing in the trees. He walked to the river and groaned when she saw his sister sitting next to it with Tristan. They were throwing stones into the water in silence. \"Edyth has been looking for you.\" Simon said causing his sister to jump. She turned to him and threw a rock at him. He glared down at her. \"You should be thanking her for talking Marke into giving you a job. He didn't want to you know.\" \"Its true.\" Tristan said with a slight smirk. \"Not to many men want a girl like you around. You cause to much trouble.\" Roana glared over at him and got to her feet. \"That is not my fault.\" Simon rolled his eyes. \"Get back to the castle Roana.\" She sighed heavily and walked away. The moment she was out of ear shot Simon turned to his friend. \"You are the reason men think she is trouble.\" Simon said sitting down next to Tristan. \"You and Melot. People are starting to think you are both courting her.\" Tristan smirked. \"She was the first nice child I met when I came here. Remember.\" Simon sighed. \"She has always run around with the boys. But know that she is older, its not highly thought of. By this rate, she will never marry.\" Tristan looked over his shoulder in the direction Roana had gone. \"She will marry. She is a beautiful girl. Many men think so. Just give it time Simon.\" Simon shook his head. \"No man will ask for her hand with you and Melot around.\" \"Maybe Melot will ask.\" Tristan said with a shrug. He then chuckled a bit. \"He has always been protective of her.\" He stood up and looked down at his friend. \"Don't worry so much Simon. You are starting to sound like your father.\" Simon stood and wiped the dirt from his pants. \"I'm the only family she has left. It's my job to worry about her now.\" Roana rushed up the steps of the castle but before she could reach the door Melot came out and grabbed her hand. \"Mother is in a mood. I wouldn't go in there just yet.\" \"Melot, I'm the reason she's in a mood.\" Roana replied pulling her hand away from him. He stopped and took her hand once again. \"Melot!\" Some one called from the casle. At once Melot started to run off, pulling Roana along with him. His mother stood in the door way calling for them to come back, but Melot kept running. He knew he'd get an ear full later, but at the moment he didn't care. \"Melot, your going to get me into trouble!\" Roana demanded. \"You're always in trouble with my mother.\" Melot said with a smirk. Roana took her hand back and stopped running. \"Not just with your mother! I'm talking about Marke and Simon.\" Melot rolled his eyed and walked up to her. \"You're always in trouble with them as well.\" Roana turned her back on him. \"Because of you or Tristan.\" Melot groaned. \"Must we talk about him.\" Roana looked at him over his shoulder. \"I thought you two were close friends.\" Melot crossed his arms. He was starting to realize Roana was messing with him. \"We are. But he always gets what I want. He always has.\" Roana rolled her eyes at him and turned to look up at him. \"What doesn't he have that every man in this village wants?\" Melot shrugged. \"He doesn't have you.\" Roana smacked his arm. \"I should have known you'd say something like that! You are playing with my head.\" Roana then took off back towards the castle. When she reached the stairs once again Melot grabbed. Her but this time around the waist. She let out a small surprised yelp as he picked her up and placed her on his shoulder. \"Uncle, I have found her.\" Melot demanded as he walked in. \"She's trouble, this one.\" Edyth placed her hands on her hips and looked sternly over at her son. \"Roana is not a young girl any more Melot. She's a young woman, and you need to teach her as such.\" Melot sighed heavily and set Roana down. He winked at her and walked out. Roana turned to Edyth and opened her mouth to say something. \"I know, you have nothing to do with being late again.\" Edyth said angrily. \"It was Tristan and Melot keeping you from your duty here.\" Roana bit her lower lip. \"Well actually no, I went to the river alone. Tristan found me there. Neither of them was to blame today.\" \"You don't have to protect them.\" Marke said with a slight laugh. He then looked at Edyth. \"Don't be so hard on her, sister. Those boys are lucky to have such a good friend in her. Later when they take a bride, they will know how to treat a woman right. That's why I'm such a gentalman.

An archer shot an arrow that landed deep in Tristan's thigh. But as if he hardly noticed, Tristan struck down the archer and stabbed the man next to him. Ducking a killing sword stroke, Tristan swung his sword and sliced into another soldier's side. Hearing the alarming shouts, Marc peaked over the stone wall. \"Tristan?\" he said perplexed. \"He's with them?\" the man beside him asked. Regaining courage, Marc yelled, \"No, he's with us!\" Marc and his men stormed down the stairs towards the Irish soldiers. Tristan, fighting with all his might, turned and was stabbed in the stomach by Wictred. But before the blade went in too deep, Tristan sidestepped and pushed Wictred away. He rushed to the drawbridge wheel where the chain that held it had been broken and shoved his sword into the spokes. With a shudder, the drawbridge stopped lowering. Wictred jumped to his feet and plunged his sword into Tristan's chest, pinning him against the giant wheel. But no matter how hard he pushed, the sword didn't seem to go in any further. Grabbing a hidden dagger in his tunic, Tristan plunged it into Witched heart, killing him. \"Tristan!\" Marc yelled as he ran to where he slumped down on the floor. Tristan pulled the sword away from him. He reached into the neck of his tunic and pulled out the small pendent that hung around his neck. A deep indent ran across it. It was a gift that Isolde had secretly given him. He had hung it around his neck close to his heart, concealing it under his tunic. Though small, it was large enough that it stopped Wictred's blade from piercing his heart. \"How did you get in here?\" Marc asked, perplexed. \"Another secret,\" Tristan weakly joked. \"Secrets...,\" Marc repeated. \"Will you always be little men, who cannot see what was and could be again?\" Marc asked the Irish armies condescendingly. \"There is no middle ground! So slay us! Or slay him,\" he yelled, pointing at the Irish King. \"Oblige them,\" King Donnchadh ordered. When no one moved, he yelled, \"Oblige them!\" When again no one moved, he struck out at the soldier standing closest to him, hitting his shield with a resounding clang. An arrow buzzed through the air, landing in the Irish king's back. Shocked and angered, he turned to find the man that shot him in the back. With a shout, he attacked the nearest soldiers. Marc, Tristan, and the other men rushed down from the drawbridge into the fray. The fighting was in mayhem, few paying attention to who they were slaying. Tristan, however, was slowed by the wounds he had received fighting in the keep. Though he fought well, he was not quick enough to avoid receiving many more injuries. He was tired and near collapse \"Tristan,\" Marc grabbed Tristan's arm and dragged him away from the fight. \"I can still fight,\" Tristan argued. \"Tristan, you have already saved us from slaughter and helped us win this battle. You don't need to kill yourself!\" Marc reasoned. He dragged Tristan across the bridge to the river. \"Go. Find Isolde and leave,\" he said, turning to go back to the battle. \"Marc,\" Tristan said. Marc stopped and turned back around. \"I'll miss you.\" The two men embraced, and Marc walked away. Where is Isolde, Tristan suddenly wondered. Then, Isolde appeared, her bag of herbs and remedies slung over her shoulder, led by one of Marc's loyal friends. \"Where are we going?\" Isolde asked. She leaned on the boats side, enjoying wind and the sea mist that blew over the ship. The day before they had arrived at a harbor town that sailed ships down the river deep into the heart of Britain. There they bought passage on a ship and were now under way, sailing towards their new future. \"The captain said we're heading towards Camelot,\" Tristan answered, standing next to her. \"Who rules Camelot?\" she inquired. \"King Arthur.\" ","Summary":" A Second Chance In a flash, Tristan jumped up through the trap door and charged into the Irish sold"},{"Movie":"Tristan + Isolde","Title":"When Fate Betrays Your Heart","Author":"iSackettEcho","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6411749","Passage":"[Chapter 1] When Fate Betrays Your Heart The little, stubby candle flickered, casting shadows on the floor of Isolde and Marc's bedroom. The sun had long since set and Marc had long since fallen asleep, but Isolde remained awake. Sometimes it was so hard to sleep. Memories swirled around in her head. She remembered the time when she had read a book to Tristan by the fire. She had read a passage about love, and as she had read, Tristan had looked at her. He looked at her through those intense brown eyes as though she were the only woman in the world- a look that made her heart flutter. The fire had been so warm. The look in his eyes had been so warm. But she could never be his. She was Marc's wife now. Was it her fault? Perhaps if she had told Tristan her real name when they first met, she would now be his wife. She remembered the tortured look in his eyes on her wedding day. He looked as though he were dying inside. Perhaps he was. Perhaps she was too. Tristan! Oh, Tristan! Why didn't I tell you my real name! she thought in anguish. Silent tears rolled down her cheeks. What a beautiful life we could have lived together... If only I could be held in your arms one more time. She remembered what it felt like to be in his arms. He was so strong yet so sweet and gentle. She had felt loved... safe... She had felt as though nothing could go wrong in the world. Tristan had made her heart race and her stomach flutter like no one else ever had before or since. She had loved him and still did. How can I live without him? Does he feel this way too? But she knew the answer to that. All she had to do was look into Tristan's eyes to see his pain. He had been avoiding her lately- she and Marc both, and she knew why. But it broke her heart every time he was not there, every time she could not see his beloved face, every time the ray of sunshine that he was to her did not cast its bright light of hope into her world of dark dreams. Why have you abandoned me here, Tristan? You are the one that said my marriage to Marc would save thousands of lives, yet every time you look at me with that tortured look in your eyes, you make me feel as though it were my fault... And perhaps it is... Oh, Tristan, if only I had told you my real name! More tears rolled silently down her cheeks. A new thought fluttered into Isolde's mind. It was a song... a fragment of a memory... a memory of her mother singing to her as a child before she died. I wish my mother were here , she sobbed . She knew what a loveless marriage was like. If only she could be here now to comfort me , to hold me in her arms and to tell me what to do, how to handle it. Perhaps she too had loved another but was forced to marry someone else, just as I had .Isolde had hoped for a marriage of love. She never believed it would happen. Her betrothed had been a ruthless, beast of a man. But then, she met Tristan. She had nursed him back to life, wounded by a poison... a poison that had come from her betrothed's sword... the sword with which Tristan had killed her betrothed. Tristan had freed her from a horrid marriage. But he still could not be hers. He had to flee Ireland to escape her father's soldiers. When she saw Tristan at the tournament, she had thought, At last, he will be mine! How deceived she had been. How can life be so cruel? To have been free at last to be with him, only to lose him again. When fate betrays your heart... Her hope, she thought, was like the flickering candle- the light and the shadows ebbed and flowed and changed on the floor and ceiling and walls. Similarly her hopes had ebbed and flowed and changed inside her. She couldn't think anymore. The memories that washed over her brought a tidal wave of emotions that she could not handle all at one. She missed Tristan so much. All she wanted was to be held in his arms again, to be told how much he love her. She could hear Marc beside her, his slow, deep breathes of slumber. Marc was not such a bad man. He always treated her well, lovingly even, but he was not Tristan. He was not the man that she love. Isolde blew out the candle, rolled over, and closed her eyes. Tomorrow would be another day, another day of acting as Marc's loving and adoring wife, another day without Tristan. But life went on. And perhaps, she might see Tristan tomorrow. He would have to come around soon. Perhaps it would be tomorrow. She clung to this hope as sleep overtook her and engulfed her in its ever-comforting arms.

She Came. After much talk with my lords, I, Marke, King of Kernow, had set out a peace agreement and had sent it with my Herald and a small embassage to Diarmid, High King of Erin with a formal request for his daughter's hand. Because I did not trust the King of Erin, I had sent with them, my Knight Champion Tristan, and because of what Merlin used to say, 'S peak soft words, G ive sweet gifts, but carry your sword in your hand . ' Within days, a message came back: the King of Erin would accept my terms of peace and give to me the hand of his only child, the Princess Iseult. \"The King requests that the marriage take place at Tara.\" My courier fidgeted as he delivered the message. I waited. His glance slid up, and down again. \"Is there more?\" I asked in a low voice. He looked around and murmured, \"Yes, Lord.\" I nodded him closer. \"My Lord Herald bid me tell you. Privily. Something is not right. He knows not what but it was right to send Lord Tristan. The Morholt challenged Lord Tristan and they fought. By lance first, then hand to hand. Lord Tristan defeated him soundly. My Lord Herald believes the challenge was expected by the King, but not that Lord Tristan would defeat the Morholt.\" \"Lord Tristan is unhurt?\" \"Not even a scratch, my Lord. My Lord Herald is further of the belief that Diarmud expected the Morholt to defeat Lord Tristan and that you Lord, would then withdraw your offer, leaving the way open for further attacks from Erin. A carefully calculated insult.\" I steepled my fingers and tapped them against my mouth. I stood, walked across the hall, and stared out of the window for some minutes before turning, walked back, beckoning my lords near. \"My Lords, despite Diarmud's seemingly eager acceptance of my offer for the Princess's hand, he has asked that the marriage take place at Tara. My Lord Herald is of the opinion that mischief is afoot.\" A rustle of surprise ran around the chamber. I held up my hand. \"I will think on it this night and I ask you to do the same. We will discuss it further tomorrow. In my bed chamber that night, after I had dismissed Tomos, my body servant, I called Tramor to sit with me. Over several years, this had become a habit. Tramor, Commander of the King's Life Guards, had become one of the three close friends and confidants that I had: another was Mordred, my cousin and son of Arthur the High King; the third being Vivian, the High King's Enchantress. I trusted them and their opinions like no others. I put my hands together as though in prayer and rubbed my nose in thought. \"What think you, Tramor? . On the morrow, my lords gathered with me in my Privy Council Chamber. \"My Lords, it is my thought that we should proceed with the marriage. I propose to send word to Diarmud that the marriage should take place here. I shall give several vague reasons as to why I may not leave Kernow at present and requesting he send the Princess so that we may marry soon. I do not think that Diarmud himself will come with the Princess. Should my Lord Herald be wrong, then we have lost nothing; if he is right then we are alerted and will be prepared.\" I paused. \"Your thoughts, my Lords? Think you, that Diarmud would give his daughter in a political marriage, then attack? I do not. His honour would be surely be besmirched.'' Murmurs and nods of agreement. \"We will set out the Treaty and the terms of Assent of Marriage. You, Brother Martin,\" I nodded at my scrivener. \"will get this done as soon as you are able, and a courier may return with it to Erin. It went as I thought. Diarmud agreed. The Princess would sail for Kernow with the Spring tides. . On one of the first fine days of Spring, I rode with Tramor to the headland that we call Land's End. One of the glorious Spring days that so often blesses Kernow, the sky was high and blue above us and the sea dancing and sparking before us. \"Look! There, Tramor! Do you see a sail?\" \"...Yes, I think... yes, two … no three.\" We waited. \"I do not see their badges yet,\" \"Nor I, but I think it is they.\" \"I, also.' We turned our horses' heads for home. Three days later, word came that they had anchored at the wharves in the estuary below Castle D'Or. The road to the castle was long and wound steeply up the cliff side. It was late and dark before they arrived. As usually happens at this time of year, a clear warm day gives way to a chill and misty night. The pitch wall torches around the greater courtyard were lit, and I had ordered pages with hand torches to light the steep steps to the great hall. The smoke from these combined with the mist to add to the gloom. She was mounting the steps as I strode out to meet her. My worst fears were realized; she was a child. So small, she barely reached my shoulder. Though huddled in cloaks and shawls, she was shivering. \"Welcome my Lady. Welcome to Castle D'Or.\" And so she came to Kernow: Iseult, Princess of all Erin. . I took her hand and with her lords and ladies following, we went into the great Hall. Amid the muttering and whispering of the court, the shuffling and craning of necks to see her, we mounted the dais. The hall was well lit with wall torches, the dais more so with a hundred or more candles, and as I presented her to my people, I saw her clearly for the first time. She was exhausted, holding herself upright by sheer force of will. Her face was wan, a sickly white, with violet shadows under her eyes. They did not meet mine; they searched the faces below us. I followed her glance; it rested first on Tristan, then on three of her father's lords. She shook a little. She had the look of a worn out child. I turned to my sister. \"Perhaps the Princess may wish to rest and dine in her chamber tonight. She has had a long journey.\" Gwennith took her with one of her ladies to the chamber that had been prepared for her. Her lords watched her go and I beckoned to Tramor. . The Princess breakfasted in her chamber, while I took mine in the lesser Hall with my guests and the most senior of my lords. The final details of the Peace Treaty were to be discussed in the morning; its formal signing and that of the Marriage Assent that afternoon. The morning meeting was smooth and urbane, each point agreed on pleasantly and easily. Diarmid's premier Lord, Laoghaire's, guarded glance slowly drifted around the Privy Chamber as they had around the great hall last night. The Lord Feargal' s eyes were on the two chests on the side table, Iseult's dowries set on her by her father and myself, together with the caskets that held the jewellery and the many gifts that befitted the marriage of the daughter of a High King. The Lord Dubhnal though, was ill at ease; his skin was sweaty and greasy. Why should that be? I excused myself from joining them and the court for the midday meal. I had matters to attend to. . When we met again for the signings that afternoon, the Princess joined us. At my request. \"You rested well, my Lady?\" For she looked so. The shadows had gone from her eyes and the pallor from her cheeks, though she was still wrapped in a great soft wool shawl. \"Indeed, my Lord. A night on dry land does much for me.\" Her voice was clear and light, confident with only the trace of her Irish brogue. The question must have been in my eyes for she went on. \"I suffer from le mal de mer, my lord,from the moment I step on board ship. \" \"Then , we will pray to the Lord Christos, you may not have to travel again for some time.\" An uneasy titter ran around her lords. I lead her to the head of the table to sit beside me. The lords sat lengthways down the table, my lords to one side, the Irish to the other. I watched her careful glance slide around her lords, resting on each. She appeared to have no affection for them, I thought. Neither did she trust them. Why should that be? They appeared devious and sly but there was no smell of a trap. She shivered a little and she tightened her lips, The Lord Laoghaire watched the Princess; his look almost lascivious though not of lust. No! More of the hunter greedily watching the lure in the trap that he had set. I signed to Edmund, my Lord Herald, to read the Treaty. Each point was formally agreed upon and the Treaty signed. He proceeded to read the Marriage Assent until finally he stopped and looked at me. I nodded. He continued. 'Should Marke the King predecease Iseult the Queen, all her dowries, lands, monies, and jewels shall be hers to use as she shall see fit and the Queen, with her Ladies, shall be free to remain in Kernow, or to return to Erin or to travel freely where so ever she may choose. Also, she may marry or not, as she chooses, without constraint.' Silence! The Irish Lords looked at each other. \"My Lord,\" Lord Laoghaire said eventually. \"But..' \"Lord Laoghaire, the Assent is as agreed upon with the King Diarmid. I wish to add this addendum. Is there a problem?\" He licked his lips and looked at his companions, shifty and furtive; I could almost smell the unease. What is it? \"I understood that, in King Diarmid's absence, you and your lords have the authority to agree to any alterations to the Assent?\" He nodded. I looked again at the Irish lords, waiting. I stood. \"This too, or nothing, my lords\" They nodded. \"My lady, do you wish to add anything?\" Huge sapphire eyes looked at me, surprised. She shook her head. \"My scrivener has drawn up three copies, my lords. One to remain in the hands of the Princess; the second, to return with you to Erin; the third, I will send to Arthur, the High King.\" Again, there came the unease amongst the Irish lords. Edmund lit a candle and held a stick of scarlet wax in its flame. He let a molten droplet fall onto each of the three parchments and I pressed my seal of state into them. A little ripple of relief ran around the room and the atmosphere lightened. I signed it and each of the lords present signed below me. At last all was finished and I dismissed them. The Irish lords waited for the Princess. I put my hand on her arm to detain her. \"Leave us.\" I said, and lead her to the seat in the window embrasure. I set my crown and cap on the side table and ran my hands through my hair. \"Sit you, my Lady.\" I took the jug on the table and poured two cups. I turned back to where she sat in the afternoon sun. I caught my breath. Whoever had said she was plain, had lied. Her face was surrounded by a white wimple, a sheer veil held in place by a gold fillet. Her skin was fine and fair with roses in her cheeks, her mouth full and red. Her eyes were the deepest sapphire and they were clear, with an honesty that her lords' eyes did not have. She raised them to mine and they were wary, almost assessing. Assessing me ? I swallowed a smile. She was young, though not as young as I had thought. She raised her eyes to mine and they were the eyes of a woman. Maybe she was, as yet a little unsure, but the intelligence in her eyes was not that of a child, and her poise was that of a High Princess. And she was beautiful. I sat beside her in the embrasure and offered her a cup. She tasted it. \"It is good. What is it?\" \"Cider, it is our drink, we make it here in the kingdom. Hey, hey, careful, it is very strong.\" I raised the cup to my mouth and put it down again without drinking. \"Now we are private with each other, is there aught you wish to ask?\" She looked down moistening her lip. \"You may ask me what you will.\" I said gently. \"How old are you? I thought you to be old but you are not, are you? At least not very.\" \"Older than you by somewhat. Of that I am certain. I am nine and twenty. How old are you, little Mistress Impertinence?\" I was smiling now. \"I was sixteen five days ago!\" \"I am impressed, Princess.\" \"You mock me, my King?\" \"I?\" I smiled again. I waited. There was more, of that I was certain. \"Do you have children?\" I hesitated, my smile dying. \"My son died with his mother on the same day as my father.\" She bit her lip. \"Forgive me, my Lord. That I knew. And that they died at the hands of my father's raiders. What I wished to ask...\" She took a deep breath. \"My mother died when I was born. I grew up at my father's court surrounded by my father's many bastards, both older and younger than I; surrounded too, by the ill feeling and scheming between existing and discarded mistresses. I learnt to deal with it. I can do so again but to be able to do so, it is necessary to know. And I should prefer to know from you than from whispered court gossip.\" I had misjudged her. Young she was but she had been the Lady of a great court and raised by a hard master. So cool and dignified. Yet, yet she seemed so vulnerable. \"No, Lady. I have no by-blows. And no mistresses. There have been women, yes but they were passing fancies of a night or two, and never women from Castle D'Or. None to give you grief.\" She bit her lip again. Again, she looked at me with that assessing look, then a slow nod, of acceptance maybe. \"You are not very tall.\" I said. \"I am not likely to grow further. If you had wanted taller, my lord, perhaps you should have looked elsewhere.\" Her tone was tart; it amused me. I brushed her cheek with the back of my hand. \"No, I think that I have found what I was looking for.\" I touched her veil and the fillet that bound it. \"I do not know what colour your hair is. May I?\" I took off the fillet, her wimple and veil and the net that held her hair I ran my fingers through it, lifting it and let it slide through my fingers. \" The colour of the King's Gold and eyes as blue as the sapphire set in his crown.\" someone had said. \"Isolda.\" It is Kernowish for her name. The colour rose in her cheeks and she stood. \"It is warm in the sun.\" She made to take off her shawl, I was before her and took it from her and laid it on a chair. I turned back to her. It was as though I had been punched in the gut and all my breath left me. She was dressed as befitted a princess, in a gown of heavy silk of a deep rich blue, its weight making it fall straight from her full high breasts to her feet. A heavy silver girdle buckled low on her hips emphasised a voluptuousness and sensuality that the childlike quality of her face denied. She had an allure of which, perhaps, she was not aware. A bolt shot to my crotch. I wanted her. I wanted her with a sharpness I had not felt for a woman in a long while. I bent to kiss her mouth but she turned her face aside, hiding her mouth with her fingers. \"Yes, you are right, my little lady. There is time and enough.\" I had given her a white palfrey as a welcome gift and I asked her now. \"How like you your mare?\" Her face lit. \"Oh! She is beautiful, I have named her Blanche.\" \"Would you try her? Ride with me this afternoon? I would show you your new home.\" We rode out through the fields and little villages spread around at the foot of the castle returning as the sun began to dip, through the glade beyond the chapel where the Roman ruins stood, dog-roses, convolvuli, woodbine scrambling over fallen walls and through shrubs. She stopped and I with her. \"What is this place?\" she asked. \"Just some old ruins.\" I said. \"It is very pretty.\" but she shivered and nudged her mare to move on. The days passed; we spent much time together discussing the wedding preparations with our people. We rode out together when we could, to know each other better. I found that she was educated as befits a Princess, able to read and write, to count and talk of poetry and music. This surprised me, I did not think that the barbaric and cruel Diarmid would educate a girl. I was to learn later that it was her foster mother, an enslaved lady of the Cymru,who had taught her, together with the use of medicines and herbs. She was shy and serious at first, but she had a quick wit that made me smile, and as we grew more at ease with each other, laughter was often near the surface. I realised that laughter was something that had been missing from my life for a long time. . Our wedding day was upon us before we knew. We were married according to the rites of the Christos and my kingdom rejoiced. The cider and ale flowed, my peopled feasted, sang and danced. I drank very little, I had no wish to go drunk to my bride. Throughout the day I was more and more aware of her youth, her fragility, how small she was. I am of tall, strong stock, I stand a head taller than most of my people: I am a knight, a soldier, with the strength and breadth that such entails, and she barely reached my shoulder. When she put her hand in mine to make our vows, I almost gasped aloud at how small it was. They bedded us with the usual bawdiness and having doused the candles, made to draw the bed curtains. \"Leave them\" I said curtly. Slowly they left us, silent together in the firelight. Hesitantly, I broached the subject that had been troubling me most of the day. \"You have been told you, have you not, what happens in the marriage bed?\" A whisper. \"Yes, my Lord\" I hesitated again. \"The first time, it will hurt.\" I paused, thinking how I must seem to her, wanting to reassure her, yet wanting her so badly. \"I will try not to hurt you too much.\" And I took her into my arms, softly and gently, aware of the stifled gasps, the knuckles that being were bitten. Yet it was good for both of us. I woke with a start in the night. A log had fallen out of the fire basket. I swung out of bed to replace it and brush the sparks safely away. Leaning my arm on the lintel, I stared down into the glowing embers. How long I stood I did not know, till I heard, \"My Lord, is aught wrong?\" She rested on her elbow, looking at me. I shook my head. I held out my hand and wrapping the fur spread around her, she came to me. I put my arm around her. \"Look! A picture in the fire. There! Castles! Castle D'Or, Tintagel...Camelot...\" She tilted her head to look where I showed her. \"Yes! Yes.\" She smiled up at me, in delight. Her hair glittered in the firelight, her eyes shining in it; it played on the white of her shoulders rising out of the dark fur. And I wanted her again, as badly as before. I slid the fur off her shoulders and spread it on the floor before the fire and took her hand to bring her down with me. Heavenly Mother, she was so sweet, so soft. I think I was falling in love with her. . In the days leading up to the wedding, I had had no time to observe Tristan or Melor, sullen and surly, or that my sister was tight lipped. But in the honey moon days after, I became aware of Melor's dark face; of Tristan refusal to share any joy. Gwennith too was mostly silent. I took her aside and asked her what was wrong. At first she denied anything, then she said she was concerned about her sons. \"Melor, I think, has always been jealous of Tristan.\" She stopped. I thought about what she said. \"But how would this account for Tristan's moods and ill manners?\" She stared down into her cup of apple juice while I waited. At last, she said, \"Tristan has always been the best at everything, accustomed to praise and favour from everyone.\" Again she waited and I with her. \"And always first with you, Brother. Marke, I think he is jealous of Isolda.\" I took this in but it was so incredible that a little bubble of laughter escaped me. \"No, no Gwenny! You are mistaken. It is too ridiculous; Tristan, jealous of a little thing like Isolda. A little girl. My wife.\" She tipped her head in acknowledgement. \"Not of a little girl. Not of your wife. You love her. He is jealous of your love for her. That she is now first in your heart. The whole court knows you are in love with her.\" I flushed. \"Oh, fach. Do not be so. Our people are delighted that you to have someone to love again. Tristan will get over it. Just treat him as ever.\" We rode daily, Isolda and I, over the countryside, visiting the smallest of hamlets that my people might see her and get to know her; that she might know and love Kernow the way I did. Each week, like most villages, the one below the Castle held a market and I went with Isolde to wander around it. She examined each bead, each piece of fruit on each stall and had a word with every holder. A gracious Lady, indeed! \"Oh! Oh, look, Marke.\" We stopped at a stall. In a basket was a very young puppy. She stroked its head. \"Aren't you sweet? So tiny. What breed is she, Marke?\" \"A brachet, a fairy greyhound. You like her?\" I tossed a couple of copper coins to the stallholder and picking up the little creature, I tucked it into her arms. I moved on and somehow lost her for a few moments Melor was at my elbow, that black look on his face. \"Where is the Queen, my Lord?\" \"She is here somewhere; she can come to no harm.\" He started to speak and there she was beside me flushed and confused, with Tristan hurrying behind her. When I retired to our bedchamber that evening, she was sitting in the big armchair by the fire. I crouched before her to scratch the head of the pup she cradled in her lap. \"You like her?\" \"Oh, I love her. Thank you.\" Then hesitantly she said, \"I have never had a dog before.\" I was surprised. \"You had no dogs at Tara?\" \"Yes, we had dogs, but they were all working dogs; guard dogs, hunting dogs, retrievers, sheep-herding dogs. My father would have no pets. Even Ulfin, his wolf hound, was a working dog.\" How strange this was to me! In Kernow, even the poorest village child had his mutt to trail on a piece of string. She surprised me further. Hiding her face in the dog's fur, she said,\"I have not had a gift before. Before this little one...and Blanche. My horses, my father always told me which I should ride.\" \"There must have been gifts aplenty for the Princess of Erin.\" \" For the Princess, yes. Gold, silver, jewels, furs but not for me; they were nothing that Essy would want.\" I lifted her and her pup and sat in the chair holding the two of them. She had taken the caul from her hair and it had fallen around her face, hiding it. I tipped her face up, brushing her hair back from her face but she turned away from me. I went on stroking it. Poor little girl. A long dead mother, a hard unfeeling father, a marriage to an unknown older man, it must seem to her that her only use was that of a pawn in the politics game. Drawenna had come young to us, she had known us, she had known me , from childhood, she had known love from me, from my parents. I would see to it, that this little one would know love. I dropped a kiss on her head. \"What are you going to call her?\" \"You say she is a fairy greyhound, so I will call her Mab, after the Queen of the Fairies.\" With the morn, Tristan came and asked my permission to leave court to go to his lands in Breidzh. I consented willingly hoping that he would be more agreeable on his return. The summer came, with its high, blue skies and hot sun. I took Isolda out to empty the lobster pots, persuading her, against her disbelief, that she would not be sick in a cyrwgl. She was not, but took her revenge for my teasing by tipping me into the sea. I coughed and spluttered, splashed and called her. \"Isolda, I cannot swim.\" She leaned over, her face full of consternation and stretched out her arm to help. I took full advantage of this, to pull her in with me. She surfaced, pushing her hair back, wiping her eyes She caught her breath, her hands on my shoulders, my arms around her. \"Marke, Marke, let me help you. Be calm. Everything is alright...\" \"Yes.\" I said and kissed her neck. \"Do not struggle..\" \"No.\"and nibbled her ear. \"Grasp the rim. Pull yourself in. I am here, I will help you. You are safe.\" I hauled myself dripping back on board, then pulled her in after me. I sat, arms resting on my knees, watching her, hiding my laughter. She half lay in the bottom of the boat, panting, weighing up the situation while puddles formed beneath us. \"Marke… … Marke…? You lied to me?!\" \"I? Your King? Would I lie to you?\" She eyed me suspiciously for a moment, then sat up. \"Can you or can you not swim?\" At my most haughty, I said \"Do you doubt my word, my Lady?\" She looked up at me through her lashes, uncertain still. Then she burst out emphatically,\"Yes, I do!\" I leaned forward to kiss her but the laughter rose. She whispered against my mouth, \"You had better be careful, my Lord, I might tip you in again.\" \"And I might tan your delightful arse .\" She was still so young, yet with each day that passed, I saw her maturing before my eyes. She delighted me, she enchanted me. I was falling deeper and deeper in love with her, and I thought that perhaps she too, might be beginning to love me. . With a good summer, the harvest was soon safely gathered in. The fruit ripened in the orchards. Every day that passed was gilded with the joy of being with her. We returned to the castle one day, with our laden baskets to find that Tristan had returned. I had thought that matters might improve with his return but no. He was soon as sullen as before and Melor as dark faced as ever. Isolde too, retreated back a little into her shell. Oddly, with his return, the younger men of the court began to huddle, whispering, in little groups. Wictrid, one of my senior lords, seemed always to be at the centre of these or ever at Melor's ear. Wictrid and I, a little younger than he, had not always agreed, and I wondered often that he should remain at court. There were subtle sneering remarks about Tristan accompanied by sniggers, just beyond my hearing. Melor came to me. \"My Lord uncle, forgive me, I must speak to you.\" he hesitated. \"there is much talk. About my brother...\" He bit his lip. \"My lord, be aware there is the scent of treason about him. There is talk too, about the Queen.\" \"There is always talk at court, Melor. Do not listen to it.\" I dismissed him. The bright early days of autumn was upon us, and Hunter's Moon brought a wild excitement on the young lords, even more so than usual. Isolda hated it and begged me not to go but it was tradition for the King to lead the night hunt. That day Melor and Wictrid came to me in privy. Wictrid was stifling excitement but Melor looked sick. \"My Lord King, we must tell you. Treason. Lord Tristan and the Queen.\" This from Wictrid with a barely hidden smile on his face. \"Explain yourself.\" \"My lord Uncle, my brother... the Queen... the Hunt tonight...\" I stood in a rage. \"You come again to me. With these lies...\" \"Uncle, I do not lie. He is my brother; I am ashamed.\" He stammered, his head lowered. I raised my hand to silence him. \"He rides with us...\" but Wictrid broke in across me, the malice clear on his face. \"He will not come. He will meet her.\" The contempt in his voice ill concealed. I sat heavily and listened to what they had to say. . The court gathered in the courtyard as dusk fell, the young lords in high excitement, laughing and calling to each other. Dark Star waited, stamping and tossing his head. I mounted him. My lady did not come to see us go. As we crossed the drawbridge, one of my captains caught up with me. \"My Lord, Lord Tristan's horse has thrown a shoe, he is returning to the castle. He will not ride tonight.\" I nodded and we rode on. We took the right bridle path and rode gently for perhaps an hour in a vast curve to bring us back to the glade with the old ruins and we waited. A horse's snuffle, a clink of a bridle and Melor's voice choked with emotion. \"You see, my Lord! My brother and the Queen.\" I rode slowly forward. She stood, in his arms, in the moonlit glade. It was only moments that I looked at them; it seemed like hours. \"Take them!\" I said turning to leave. My lords made to follow me \"Stay!\" I choked out the word and slapped Dark Star across his rump with my reins and we fled from that dreadful place. . When at last I returned to the castle, my lords were met in the great hall. Melor stood on the first step of the dais, though I could not look at him. The ladies, roused from their beds by our early return, gathered in whispering groups: Isolda's Irish ladies huddled, white faced, in a corner. One of the guards brought Branwen to the hall to stand before the dais. \"Lady Branwen, do you know where the Queen was tonight?\" I asked, cold and soft. She bit her lip. \"I don't know where she is, Lord. I have looked...\" \"I know where she is now! Where did she go? When the hunt left the castle tonight?\" She looked at Melor. \"I don't know, my Lord.\" \"You lie. I know you lie. You told Lord Melor where she was going. The glade of the ruined I found her with Lord Tristan.\" She gasped. Her eyes, wide with terror, went to Melor beseeching but he resolutely refused to meet them. \"My Lord, my Lord...\" \"You knew.\" I said coldly. \"You knew where they would be! You told your lover. He told me.\" She gasped again, her mouth trembling with fear and her eyes flooded. \"Spare me your tears. Whatever your loyalties may be to me, Lady, you betrayed your mistress, your sister.' The contempt in my voice ripped into her. \"Take her away.\" The guards took her arms. \"Melor. Melor!\" Not once did Melor look at her. They brought Tristan. He stood before me, his hands tied. The pain of the betrayal by the two people I loved most in the world was tearing me apart. I could not speak to him. My lords questioned him. He said nothing. Accusation after accusation, yet he said nothing but watched me throughout. \"Take him away.\" I whispered. I left the hall and went to my chamber, not the King's bedchamber but my boyhood one. I saw no-one, spoke to no-one, though I knew Tramor kept watch outside. I paced up and down, the pain and the anger never leaving me. Through the dawn and the day. Through the eve of the second night. When I could bear it no longer, I went through the silent castle, Tramor behind me. To the guard room. They stood, stiff with apprehension, while I took the cell keys and a pitch torch. Tramor, in his fear of what I might do, grasped my forearm but I shook him off and alone, I went down to her. She sat on a low cot in that dark dank cell lit only by a tallow candle. I put the torch into the holder on the wall. The walls, streaming with damp, gleamed in its flickering light. With one hand, I pulled her up and pinned her against the wall under its bile of jealousy searing through me. \"Why? Tell me! Tell me. I want to know.\" \"Why? Was he better than me? What could he do that I couldn't? \" My hand around her throat: I pushed her chin up with my thumb. \"How long? How many times? When did it start? Tell me! Everything!\" My eyes never left hers, nor hers mine, though her tears ran continuously, soaking the breast of her gown. They never left mine as she told me. About Erin, about the voyage, about here in Castle D'Or \"I love you Marke, Not him, only you.\" She looked so young, I wanted to break her neck; I could have snapped that slender neck. Instead I splayed my hand against her beautiful face. With a muffled \"I do not believe you.\", I pushed her away from me so she fell to the ground and I fled away from her. I lay in my chamber, paced the floor, sat unseeing, throughout that night. In my mind's eyes I could see her, him. Their young bodies together. His hands on her. Did they have the ecstasy that we had had? That she had given to me? Jesu! I want to tear down Crysalor, my great battle Sword, from the wall behind my throne. I want to feel it in my hand, heft its weight, swing it before me. Use it. On them. The law says the punishment for adultery is death by hanging for common folk. It is my right. It is the law. The law says a knight of noble birth, may die beheaded by sword: a lady of birth must burn at the stake. And a Queen? Isolda, Isolda! It is my right. It is the law. It is the law of Britain that Arthur made; that he and my father upheld. That I, as Kernow's King, uphold. Did not Merlin teach me justice for all, within the law? Yes, the King's Justice for all. But what about a King? Shall there not be justice for a King? Shall there be no justice for me? Sweet Christos! Help me! How can I bear it? Did he not teach me justice with mercy? . My chamber lightened with the dawn. And still I sat At last I opened my chamber door. Tramor was there as I knew he would be. As he had been a day and a night long. I left the door open so that he might enter. I gave him my judgment. Tristan to be banished to his lands in Breidzh for the rest of his days. The Queen to return to Erin with her ladies and the few Irish knights that had remained in Kernow; a troop of guards to escort them safely. With all her possessions. It seemed very little time before Tramor returned. He stood waiting until I acknowledged him. \"My Lord, he hesitated \"My lord...\" \"Yes? \"I said wearily. \"The Queen… the Queen asked…. Some of her ladies have wed and settled in Kernow. Of your mercy, she begs for them that they may stay safely. For herself, she begs that she may not return to Erin but that she be escorted to the borders of Kernow. She wishes to go alone. She does not want the remainder of her ladies to accompany her, not even Lady Branwen.\" \"Those that wish to do so, may remain in the Kingdom in all safety with the exception of the Lady Branwen. Lady Branwen must leave. I will not have her here.\" My Lord,\" his voice low, barely above a whisper. \"Lord Melor ...He is Lady Branwen's lover.\" \"If Lord Melor wishes to take her to Breidzh, he may do so. She may not stay here.\" \"She is with child.\" I shrugged. I sank back into my chair. He waited. He turned to leave, and I said \"Tramor, you will command the Queen's escort, wherever she wishes. \"Of course, my Lord.\" . Tramor came and told me they were ready, I made no answer. I had no wish to see them go but I heard the troop of horses leave. Though there were still two or more battalions of troops still in the castle, a silence fell with the drawbridge and portcullis. Supper was served. I wanted nothing. The court ate in silence and dispersed. I went up to the battlements. Silence held reign there too. Not a whisper; not a rustle or bird call. I was coming down the steps, when the stillness was broken, the warning bell being rung violently and the sound of mailed feet on stone. \"My Lord, my Lord.\" Tramor's hoarse voice. What did he back here? \"A trap, a trap!\" I met him at the door of the armoury. My lords pouring into it to arm. The noise, the panic, the fear. I could barely hear him. \"The Irish...\" I stopped my breath. \"The Queen?\" \"She is safe, Lord.\" He slung my breastplate around me and was buckling it. My face showed my thoughts, thoughts that had never entered his head. \"No Lord, not the Queen. We are betrayed . The Irish know of the tunnel into the castle…. We came through. . . Diarmid is beyond the moat waiting for a breakthrough.\" \"No.\" he said yet again. \"Not the Queen! We, Tristan and I suspected something, We returned through the tunnel to warn you. They came up behind us. Wictrid was waiting in the tunnel and. . . . . Melor, but he joined us. Melor ... he is there with as many of my troop as was safe to take and not risk the Queen,...\" I glanced at him. \"We have work to do, tell me later.\" He handed me my helm and Crysalor My captains gathered around us for their orders. And we went out into that horror, the noise of metal clashing, shrieking, sparking of steel on steel; the moans and screams of wounded men, the smell of spilt blood and torn guts. The sickening fear that even the bravest feels when he goes into battle. Smoke and fire and burning flesh. Smoke! Christos! Fire arrows! My captains are well trained but to be trapped in a burning castle, should not be asked of any man. There came the clangour of axes on iron. They were attacking the drawbridge! Wait! Think! 'Tis the time for calm and careful judgment. Merlin's voice; I will teach you chess, and geography…. … his t o ry . … \" I will be a Knight, a soldier, Merlin. W h at need I of history ?\" \" A good commander can make use of anything. Now listen you, Marke! You can learn from great defences! Horatius defended Rome. On a bridge with only two others in a straight narrow path. Three stopped a thousand.\" I gave my orders. Half my troop to go to Melor to help drive back the Irish that had gained entry through the tunnel. Once the tunnel was regained, they were to circle around and come up behind Diamid on the far side of the moat. The remainder would come forward to the gate with me. Half blinded by the smoke and our watering eyes, we slipped and slid across cobbles slimy with blood and water. \"Raise the portcullis, then lower the drawbridge.\" A little hiss rippled around the small band of men. I drew my sword and turned to them. \"Melor will hold those behind us. You men will wait here until Advance is called. But first, I need two men with me. Three can stop them in the gateway.\" The clamour and shouting, the clash of steel swirled around, outside and behind us but the men around me were silent. \"Who will stand by my side?\" Tramor was at my side almost before I finished speaking. \"I will, my Lord!\" Tristan pushed his way to the front and knelt before me. \"Will you take me, my Lord?\" I smiled a fierce smile. \"I could not ask for better. Come!\" The portcullis up, the drawbridge fell with a crash and side by side, we strode forward through the smoke to stand in the great arched entrance to Merlin's invincible fortress. We let them come to us, and slowly the numbers that came forward to challenge us hand to hand, diminished. I signaled to the band behind us and we ran across the drawbridge to take the fight to them. It was hard and bloody. Many losses and wounded on both sides. Sweet Jesu! How many more of them? \"My Lord, you must come! It is Lord Tristan, he has fallen! He is dying!\" They took me to where he lay under the drawbridge stanchions. I sank to my knees and lifted his head onto my lap. \"Lady Gwennith? And Lord Melor?\" \"Lord Melor has fallen too, Lord; Lady Gwennith tends him.\" \"Find Sir Tramor! Tell him, the Queen is needed.\" My captains were demanding that I return that the men might see me. Soon, soon. She came, Lady Branwen behind her. \"He is dying.\" Gently she lifted his head from my lap to hers. \"No!\" She said fiercely. \"I will not let him. Go, my Lord, you are needed.\" I went with my captains knowing that she would fight for him but with my heart sick at her love for him. Not for me. The tide turned at last; we knew that the day would be ours. Diarmid fled with the remains of his army to his boats and home to Erin. I stood, bloodied and unwashed, unhurt, and looked around at the dreadful aftermath. The dead and the living to count, the wounded to be cared for and I, their king who led them into this, must speak to each man, words of comfort and reassurance. Tomos, my body servant came with my armourer to unbuckle me. \"My Lord.\" he murmured. \"The Queen awaits.\" and nodded to the gateway. She stood there patiently, the smoke and mist swirling around her, waiting for me. \"He is dead?\" \"No, my Lord, he will live. But we lost Lord Melor. We have put Tristan in a boat, Lady Gwennith goes with him to Breidzh. They leave with the tide. Perhaps you may wish to see them before they go.\" I said nothing. \"Do I have your permission to leave?\" A short curt nod and I turned back to the carnage that lay around. I climbed wearily, at last, to my chamber. It was cool and all calmness. Tomos waited with water and towels. I sent him away, sluiced myself down and pulled on a clean shirt and bracchae. I went barefoot to the window; the Britannic sea, as far as the horizon, was crimson and gold with the end of this dreadful day. I looked below to where a boat, small and black against the bright reflection of the dying sun, slid out of the harbour towards Breidzh. I lay wearily on my bed and slept. . . I awoke with the new morn and met with my captains. Together we inspected the castle, our defences, our armaments. I visited the wounded again, checked the lists of the prisoners and of the dead, and worst of all, tried speak comfort to the widows and children and to reassure them as to security. It was some time before I realised that Tramor was not at the castle. My captains knew naught of his whereabouts. We were to check the lists again when I remembered the small boat slipping out of the harbour and realised of course, he was escort to the Queen. With a fair sky and a following wind, he would be back in Kernow within four, maybe five days. It was almost twice that when, in the Privy Council Chamber, I noticed Steffan, my seneschal and Brother Martin, my scrivener shifting uneasily. I looked up from the spread scrolls. Tramor stood quietly before my table waiting for my attention. I tossed the quill on the table and jerked my head at the other two to leave us. \"You took your time.\" I said coldly leaning back in my chair. 'Only as much as was needed, Lord.\" \"With fair winds, it needs only five days to Breidzh and back.\" \"At your command my Lord, we escorted the Queen to where she wanted to go. She did not wish to go to Breidzh. She wished \" I held up my hand to silence him. \"I have no wish to know.\" My tone was even more frigid. \"You may go.\" He made no move and I raised a haughty eyebrow. His cloak was twisted up in front of him in a bundle; he hitched it up awkwardly. \"Your command, Lord, was to escort the Queen, with her goods and chattels. When we left her, the Queen …\" he stopped at my chilling look, then continued. \"She took only what she brought with her; the dowry that the King of Erin settled on her, her jewels, her furs. The dowry from you, the furs and jewels you gave her, her palfrey, all these she left. And this.\" He unwrapped his cloak and dropped a squirming wriggling creature gently to the floor. She ran eagerly to my feet, jumping up on me, yapping with excitement. Mab. I pushed her down. My eyes met Tramor's. \"Is that everything?\" He nodded. \"That will be the dog.\" He picked her up but she squirmed down and ran back again to jump on me. \"Sit!\" I snapped at her. Mab sat at my feet, giving little whimpering demands for my attention. I jerked my head for Tramor to go. I looked down at her, \"You were rejected also?\" I watched her nudge my leg, listened to her little begging whines. \"Come then, little lady.\" I reached down and lifted her onto my lap, her little body wriggling with joy. Her yelps of delight alternating with licking of my face. I curled her into me, stroking her head. In the days and months that followed, she was at my heels everywhere, a little blonde shadow, and at night, she slept at the foot of my bed. . .~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~~. . Part Two Mordred Came . It was a sign of his misery that he came alone, without even his body servant. That he had been to see his mother was a sign of the one who had inflicted that pain, and of how deep that misery was. Morgause always took every opportunity to control her sons, to hurt them if for any reason they had offended her. Mordred, while loving her, had been hurt so many times by her, that he tried to keep away from her. Needing to get away from Camelot, he had given in to her repeated requests and had visited her. He had told me, many years ago when we were boys of sixteen, that he loved Guinevere, his father's wife. I am certain that his mother knew; certain too, that at Camelot, only Arthur did not know. As everyone knew that Guinevere and Lancelot had been lovers for many years. Except, unbelievable as it might seem, Mordred. In her malice, Morgause had told him about Guinevere and Lancelot. He arrived at Castle D'Or, more wretched and tormented than I had seen him in many years. He found the words difficult to get out but at last he told me. \"Mother said that Lancelot is the Queen's lover. She said that he has been so for many years … the whole court knows...I do not believe it. I cannot... Is it so, Marke? You know how it is? You would tell me, Marke?\" I waited, thinking how to say it. His voice shaking. \"It is so, is it not?\" I did not answer. \"Mighty Arawn! Tell me! \" \"Mordred, Mordred.\" \"How long have you known?\" I shrugged. \"I do not know, Mordred. Since I was a boy.\" A harsh gasp of breath escaped him. \"And my father, does he know?\" \"Merlin tried to explain to me once...\" \" Merciful Old Ones! Merlin knew too? \" He wept, silently, the tears pouring down his cheeks. . We talked and rode; we rode through the day. We talked through the nights. Neither of us drank much, just hammered our way around our thoughts. At last, Mordred said he was ready to return to Camelot. \"My father will need my support. There are those that talk treason.\" \"You will say nothing?\" \"There are enough saying plenty. I would not hurt my father so.\" \"And Lance?\" \"I will find that difficult but I will say nothing.\" . .~~~~~*~~~~~ He said nothing but I was to learn over the months, that whispers were being poured into Arthur's ears, whispers for which Mordred was to be blamed. Poison was poured too, into Mordred's disbelieving ears. Many of the Companions of the Table Round, dissatisfied and jealous, schemed and plotted and laid traps. Mordred desperate to prove them wrong, went with them. The triumphant knights, to Mordred's sickened horror, led Arthur to find the Queen and Lancelot together. Oh! how I knew that trap. Lancelot escaped Camelot but Guinevere fell into the hands of Arthur's treacherous lords. Using his laws, they tried and found her guilty, before Arthur and his son. Guilty, they said. Guilty as charged and sentenced to the stake. The day that the sentence was to be carried out, Lancelot and his troop of knights broke into Camelot's keep and carried the Queen off. Some say that Arthur's defences were weak, deliberately so. Some say that the Queen escaped to a convent, others that Lancelot let her go. Whichever, the King retook the queen and held her away from Camelot at Sherborne Abbey. Arthur's Companions filled with bloodlust and wanting revenge, persuaded him to pursue Lancelot to punish him. \"This is the law.\" they said. \" Your law. The same law for all. Why should Lancelot du Lac escape justice?\" Arthur, seemingly unable to hold out against them, agreed to take a punitive force to the Joyous Garde, Lance's demesne in Aquitaine. Aware that treachery might be afoot, that he might even lose his life, he made Mordred his Regent. Concerned too about Guinevere, he asked Mordred to protect her. The weeks passed. Word came of attacks by the Saxon Hordes on on the eastern boundaries of Arthur's kingdom; Mordred was pressed hard by them, though I knew he could hold them. News of Arthur trickled through; of some skirmishes easily won, advancing across Lancelot's demesne, then a worn and exhausted messenger from Mordred rode in to tell me that the High King had died. Even in my grief, I knew that Mordred had need of me. I put what was necessary in place at Castle D'Or with Tramor in command and I returned with the courier to Camelot. The weather was awful as only Kernow could be when the Westerly gales sweep across it. We struggled on and had reached the border, when, the wind dropping for a few moments, we could hear voices, behind us, faintly calling. We waited: it was two messengers from Castle D'Or. Just after we had left, a small boat had sailed into the harbour below the castle. Headed for one of Camelot's ports, it had been blown off course. It had held a messenger from France. Arthur was alive; he had been sick but was no longer in danger. He would remain for a few weeks to get stronger and then return to Camelot. We continued with our journey. For Mordred's love of his father; he should know the good news as soon as he could be told. When we rode into Camelot's stable yard, all was not as I would have expected. It was subdued, yes! Not quite partying. No, not quite. But mourning? No, nor that! I dismounted and threw Dark Star's reins to an ostler. He did not meet my eyes. \"The Prince, where is he?\" \"He has retired, my Lord.\" I ran up the steps into the palace. There was a slack slovenliness about Arthur's beautiful Great Hall. Gasps and mutters ran around it as I entered. \"Where is the Prince?\" I asked again. \"He is a-bed, my Lord. The King's Bedchamber.\" The tone of the response was sneering and impertinent. I made for the Great Stairs. \"I do not think you should..' I turned and stared haughtily at the knight who spoke. His voice died away. I continued fast up to Arthur's bedchamber. There were no guards in the corridors or before its door. I opened the door and went straight in. \"Sweet Jesu!\" Mordred was in the centre of the chamber, naked under his loosely fastened chamber robe, a goblet of wine in each hand. In the tumbled sheets and furs of Arthur's great bed, Guinevere lay languid and sated, her small smile was one of the cat that at last has had the cream. She raised a lazy and amused eyebrow. \"Are you accustomed to bursting into a lady's bed chamber, my lord King? \"Jesu!\" I said again. \"Get dressed, cousin. A word with you, alone!\" \"There is nothing that you cannot say before Guinevere. We are to be wed.\" \" Wed? Christos, Mordred! How can this be?\" \"Oh Mordred, ignore him.\" Guinevere 's creamy voice came. \"He was always a sanctimonious little prig. He has nothing to say to us.\" \" No, my Lady? What think you of ' y our husband is still alive? \" When Mordred joined me in the outer chamber, the horror that he had betrayed his father out weighed the joy that previously had been uppermost. His defence poured out. ' I went to her, when I learnt my father was dead. My thoughts were that she should know; that in her distress she would need comfort. She was in sore fear of the Round Table Companions. She knew their thoughts about her. She feared that they would imprison her; send her to the stake again. She threw herself into my protection. I brought her back here to Camelot. And …\" \"She seduced you.\" I said flatly. \"No! No, of course not. It was I.\" He saw the scepticism on my face and turned away. \"You never liked her.\" He was filled with horror and yet, he found loss of Guinevere unbearable. \"I will not give her up. She loves me. She never loved him. Only me! He never loved her.\" \"Is that what she told you? You know Arthur loved her.\" He turned away. \"She needs me. I will fight for her. My lords will support me. The Company of the Knights of the Round Table is finished.\" \"Mordred, Arthur is still your King!\" And I added in a lower voice, \"and your father.\" \"I cannot give her up.\" But there was no need, for come the morn, Guinevere had gone. She would always choose which was best for Guinevere: and Arthur was still High King. . Arthur arrived back in a Kingdom racked by Saxon attacks and defiant lords, dissatisfied and greedy, pushing his son to rebel. Behind him, his loyal lords, calling for him to punish Mordred, ready to fight. I met with Mordred on the border of Arthur's kingdom and Kernow. He still held Camelot. He was thin and pale. \"There will be battle, Marke. I do not want it. My lords are determined on it. My father's lords too.\" his voice broke. \"It seems he is set on it.\" \"Will you fight for him?\" I hesitated before I answered. \"Arthur is my liege lord. But in this, no. I will not fight for him. Neither will I fight for you. Where is Guinevere?\" \"I do not know.\" He looked defeated. . When I left Mordred, I turned north and bore east until I came to Applegarth. \"I wondered when you would come.\" Vivian said. I leaned back in Merlin's chair and closed my eyes. I heard the clink of a goblet set down to my hand. \"I am tired.\" \"Yes\" she said, and waited. \"There will be war, Vivian.\" She made a little sound of agreement. \"Arthur has the right in this. Guinevere is his wife, but Mordred has loved her from a boy. He is a babe in her hands. I will not take sides. This I have told Mordred. I will tell Arthur the same. I cannot fight for one against the other. I love them both.\" I brooded a while before i asked. \"Vivian, have you 'Seen' anything?\" \"I know only that times will be hard for some little time but peace will come and Britain will be safe in your lifetime and mine.\" I had watched her through lowered lids; she knew more but none that she would tell. I asked no more of her. Nor did she ask aught of me, though I had thought she might. \"You will go to Arthur tomorrow?\" I nodded. \"Rest here tonight, have supper with me and be on your way early tomorrow.\" I slept that night in Merlin's great bed. Alone. I did not have to. I chose to do so. . . ~~~~~~*~~~~~~. What happened that day at Camlann, I remembered only later; the horror of it coming back to me in flashes. I was still with Arthur when the news came that Mordred was less than an hour's march away. Two great armies gathered on that plain. Arthur wanted to speak with Mordred. I rode to speak with Mordred and give him his father's message. We returned together and he waited while I told Arthur that Mordred would not fight. Arthur wearily waited to speak with him. I raised my hand to call Mordred to his father's side and I rode away leaving them together. Behind the lines, I dismounted. \"My lord.\" A boy sank to his knee beside me. \"My Lord King sent me. I saw him, this morning at sunrise but I did not find you until now.\" The boy was gasping for breath. \"What is it? \"The King sent me back behind the lines. I wanted to fight for him but he said to find you and to tell you to take me back to Kernow with you. To tell you never to forget Camelot.\" His breathing was easier now. \"What is your name, boy? \" \"Tom, my Lord, Thomas Malory\" \"Thomas, go to my tent and find my body servant. He is Tomos too. Go you, now... for on days like this, friend and foe alike are shadows in the mist. And friend will slay friend not knowing whom he slays. Confusion will reign since each sees not whom he fights.\" I heard a great roar and turned to see Mordred fall. I learnt later that Arthur had met Mordred on foot before the linen covered table where Excalibur lay. Mordred had told Arthur he would not fight. He knelt to swear allegiance and began to unsheathe his sword to proffer to Arthur. As he was doing so, Arthur saw a viper slither from under the clothed table behind Mordred. It coiled around, its flat head raised to strike at him. Arthur seized Excalibur from the table, slashing off its head. A soldier's fast reaction. He slipped in the churned up mud, and reaching out, clasped Mordred's arm to prevent himself from falling. Mordred, misunderstanding his father's movement, thrust upward with his sword between the plates of Arthur 's armour and following through, thrust again into Arthur until, too late, he saw the viper that his father had decapitated. In despair, he threw his sword away and, seizing Excalibur's blade, pulled it into himself, using his father's falling weight to thrust the great sword further into himself. A great roar went up as both armies, seeing the flash of steel, believed it to be the signal to arms. The thunder of hooves, clash of steel, shouts, the screams of men and horses. It began. I drove Dark Star through to the horrendous bloodshed where my cousins lay. I signaled to Mordred's squires to come. I threw myself down to kneel at Arthur's side. \"Arthur,\" He opened his eyes but the light was fading from them. \"Marke...\" my name was a gasp of breath. \" Marke…Britain …Merlin saw …\" A pink froth appeared on his lips. He dragged in another breath. And out. HIs blood gushed over me but his eyes were on mine. He tried to lift a hand but it was too much for him. I bent down to him to hear what he was trying to say. Again, he moved his hand. I took it. \"Marke\" It was barely above a whisper,\" Marke… Never forget that the King's peace is bought with the sword … a heavy price to be paid. Merlin knew … knew you would follow.… To you, I throw the torch from these failing hands….hold it high to guide our wounded country...\" I thought he had gone, for his grip on my hand fell away, but he took another dreadful breath. I summoned the trumpeters to call the ' cease arms ' but they were of little use to stop the charge. There was no way of stopping this blood lust. I knelt again at Arthur's side. \"Bedivere... to me...\" \"My Lord?\" Arthur's squires questioned me.\"The King said to carry him to the edge of the sedge, to the little hut at that we would find there. May we?\" I nodded and they bore him away to tend him. I left the field and made my way to where the wounded and dying lay. Mordred's body servant stood waiting for me. I looked at him questioning but he shook his head. \"Prince Mordred is gone, my Lord.\" But this I already knew in my heart. \"Call me when all is ready. We will mark his passing with all honours, as befits the son and grandson of kings. Arthur's squire came. \"The King?\" He shook his head. \" He may well hold on for a little while, Lord but not long, I think. He said Excalibur must be returned to the Lady of the Lake. Lord Bedivere has taken it there. The King will wait until the Ladies come. Go you, my Lord, to those whom you may still help.\" I turned to go, then turned back. \"The Ladies?\" I asked. \"I do not know, my Lord. My Lord Arthur said ' Take me to yon hut. I will wait there till the L adies come. They will come. \" So many lost their lives that day. At its end, we did, indeed, mark Mordred's passing with all honors, building him a great pyre according to the rites of the Old Ones, whom he had followed. As for Arthur, no man saw his going. 'Tis said that four Queens bore him on a black draped barge into the mists of the Summer County to be buried on Avalon there. Some believe he lies sleeping in a cave, waiting to be awakened to defend his beloved land. . .~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~. . Part 3 Finale In Arthur's scrolls and parchments, his lords found his will and in it, the words ' My Crown to my most beloved son, Mordred. Should the Prince Mordred predecease me, then the Crown to my beloved cousin, Marke of Kernow.' It took time to clear the plain, to bury the dead, to care for the wounded. When we returned to Camelot, we found that renegade lords, deserting the field, had pillaged the castle, firing it, tearing down what they could, stealing what they could carry away. I decided against rebuilding it. What was the point? Arthur's Camelot was gone. I could allow its remaining stones and wood to be used by those who had need of them. I could bring order again to his kingdom; hold his borders against the marauding Saxons in the east and the Picts in the North. I could bind his Kingdom and mine... I kept young Tom Malory near me, a reminder of Arthur's words to me. 'Never forget Camelot' I reflected much on this. I did not need to rebuild Camelot to remember. Camelot is an ideal to live by. . The King's Justice for all. Trial by peers. Might Is not Right. . Arthur, Mordred and Merlin would always be in my heart. Gawain and Gareth, the twins Gaheris and Agravaine, Pellinore and Lance. Bedivere, Kay and those others who died on Camlann's field. They will not be forgotten. Camelot, in my mind, will still be there in its glory, on the side of the Mendips. I will not let it be forgotten. It will live in the minds and hearts of Arthur's people, and mine. Their children and their children' children. . It took time to bring some semblance of order to the land; time to build the defences on the eastern coast against the Saxon hordes. All through the rest of that summer, autumn and winter. All through the next spring, to a second summer, a second autumn riding across the two kingdoms again and again: to bring peace to the land. Were they necessary, those long months away? Was it so? I returned at last to Castle D'Or. I had been on the north coast for several weeks, Tramor with me. He had accompanied me to my chambers, although he must have been as weary as I. \"Go home, Tramor!\" \"My Lord.\" A smile of thanks, a bow of the head and he was gone. It had been several years now, that he had had a house just inside the castle walls. I poured a horn of ale and wandered over to the window. Tramor was running lightly down the steps. There was a squealing. \"Dada, Dada.\" Two young children detached themselves from a group of youngsters playing near the armoury door; they flung themselves to clasp Tramor around the legs. I was envious. The force of it flooded me and I leant against the wall and closed my eyes. Any man in my Kingdom, in his cottage, with his loving wife, his children at his feet, was richer by far than I. My cold, empty, lonely life. I could fill my nights easily, should I wish. There were plenty who would share the King's bed, but there was no-one that I wanted. Yet I could not bear the loneliness of Castle D'Or. Into my head slid a tart young voice that I had not heard for some time. ' So, Marke! You are still feeling sorry for yourself?' Drawenna. A small smile formed on my mouth. Still telling me what I should do. ' Well, you know how to rectify matters.' Her voice was already drifting away. . Winter was late coming. Lovely autumn days, mild clear nights. I was in my council chamber. \"My lord, a boat has arrived with a messenger from Breidzh.\" The parchment was in my sister's hand and sealed with her seal. Messages from Breidzh were rare, my sister deeming it wise. I put it to one side until I was alone. There was no formal heading. It was short and to the point. Marke, Brother, You should know that on the Spring equinox, 25th of last month, Tristan married the daughter of his sworn lord Hoel. Her name is Iseult of the White Hands. I am well. Your sister Gwennnith . I miss you. . So Tristan was married. It floated continuously around my mind. Two, three days. Tramor had had leave and was back on duty. When I retired that night, I nodded for him to stay, pushing a goblet of wine towards him. He sat in silence as he always did. \"My sister wrote to me that Tristan has married the daughter of Lord Hoel.\" I waited. He said nothing. \"What think you?\" He swirled the wine around in its goblet, watching it, before he answered. \"Lord, he is a young man. He has no overlord now. He needs no man's say so.\" Silence again. \"Aught else?\" \"Perhaps there are some in the Kingdom who should know.\" I mulled this over. \"If there are, then, of a certainty, would not Tristan have told them?\" \"Of a certainty! If he knew where they might be.\" \"Would not these others have told Tristan where they might be found?\" \"Perhaps so, Lord.\" \"But you do not think so?\" He gestured, opening his hands. \"I cannot say, Lord.\" We sat in silence yet again. \"You may go. Goodnight.\" My tone was surly, although my churlishness was not directed at him. The next three days, I spent riding hard, from dawn till dusk, with sour looks behind my back from the small troop that accompanied me. I returned early to the castle, handing over Dark Star to a stable boy and took the great steps three at a time, straight up to my chamber. Startled, Tomos said, \"My Lord, we were not expecting you back so soon.\" I threw down my riding gauntlets. \"Find Sir Tramor!\" I jerked my head to dismiss Tomos and stood, my arm resting on the stone mantel shelf, staring into nowhere, listening for his footsteps to come fast through the outer chamber. \"My Lord?\" \"Where is she?\" . .~~~~~~~*~~~~~~~. It took us, Tramor, two troopers and I, three days to cross the great moors and come at last to the Abbey at Glastonbury. I wore no armour or crown, only my riding leathers and a narrow gold band set on a cap. I sent them on to the hostellery of the monastery at the far side of the Abbey and went to the Convent. The grill in the door slid back in response to my knock. \"I wish to see the Queen of Kernow.\" I asked of the janitress. Calm grey eyes observed me keenly before replying. \"There are no queens here, my Lord.\" \"Then I will see the Mother Abbess. My name is Marke Cunomorus.\" A tiny flicker of her eyebrows showed me that she had recognised my name. She nodded graciously and shut the grill again. In a very short time, the door opened and she ushered me down a wide corridor. It was bright with lime wash, the floor highly polished and smelled of beeswax and lavender. She led me through one door, along the cloister, to knock on another. We were bid enter and a tall stately woman rose from behind a writing table. \"My Lord King, I bid you welcome.\" \"You know me?\" \"How not? I was at court when Arthur the King knighted you. Also, I met Prince Merlin many times before I entered the religious life.\" A faint smile. \"The resemblance is remarkable.\" The smile was there but her hands trembled; she pressed them hard on the table and the slight tremor disappeared. \"How may I help you?\" \"Mother Abbess, the captain of my Life Guards told me that he brought the Queen here, but the janitress tells that is not so.\" \"My Lord King, we do not use titles inside the convent walls. The Queen is known as Lady Iseult.\" \"I wish to see the Queen.\" My tone was chilly and showed that my control was slipping. \"I will send to Lady Iseult, and if she...\" \"Mother Abbess, I have ridden three days to come here. Please do not try my patience any further.\" She tipped her head in acknowledgement and rang a tiny bell. A young novice came; plain, big and awkward, and more than a little simple. \"Sister Agnes, please find Lady Iseult and tell her I wish to see her in the guest solar. And Sister Agnes! Please remember not to run. Decorum at all times. If you would come with me, my Lord.\" Down a seemingly interminable passage, she led me through a small antechamber into a larger more comfortable chamber. \"I will ask Sister cellarer to bring you some food, and drink? Ale, wine or cider if you prefer?\" \"Thank you, no.\" Again that gracious but cool nod as she left. I cared not. I wandered around the room; I went to the window and peered out. I flung myself in a chair, got up, took off my cap and band and ran my hands through my hair. I sat again throwing my cap down onto a small table and again I got up and went to the window. The latch clicked and she was there, small and fragile. Isolda. I bowed awkwardly to her and she dropped a small, neat curtsey, pointing to a chair, sat in another. I searched for the right words. \"My Lady… My Lady umm... I have no wish for you to think I come out of malice...\" I chewed my lip. I blurted it out, \"My Lady, Tristan is married.\" Her brows faintly raised, she moistened her lips and said,\"My Lord, I wish him well; I shall always do so, but his marriage is nothing to me.\" She watched me prowl across the chamber and back. \"Have you taken Holy Orders?\" She was dressed in the habit of the order of the nuns at the convent. \"How could I, even if I so wished?\" Another silence. \"Is there anything you wish to ask?\" I asked. A soft \"No.\" \"Then I shall not impose further on Mother Abbess's hospitality.\" At the door, I stopped and without turning, said \"You are thin.\" She made no reply. . The simple child escorted me to the gate. I heard the janitress scold her as I left. \"Do not run, Sister Agnes. Hands in sleeves and walk at all times.\" I crossed the Abbey Close to join Tramor in the monastery hostellery but instead I turned and went into the Abbey. I sat on a bench at the rear of the soaringly beautiful building, my head in my hands. Blessed Virgin, help me. Behind me, the great door of the Abbey opened, footsteps approached and someone sat beside me. Tramor. He waited. \"Sweet Jesu, Tramor! What should I do?\" \"Lord, only you know what it is that you want. I cannot tell you.\" We sat in silence together. It was not long before he left to return to the hostellery. I sat a while longer before I returned to the convent. \"I wish to leave a message for the Lady Iseult. Should there be an answer, I shall be in the Abbey.\" . The lovely day had begun to lose its brightness and deepen into a pale mauve before the latch of the door from the cloister into the Abbey clicked and the slip-slap of ungainly feet drew nearer. \"My um My Lul ord King.\" It was then that I realised that the girl was not simple, merely terrified of me, and ill fitting sandals were the cause of her awkward gait. \"Mother Abbess wishes to see me, Sister Agnes?\" I smiled up at her and her plainness was dissolved into sweetness by her smile and the goodness and kindness in her eyes. \"Let us go, then.\" She took me back along the cloisters to Mother Abbess's office. \"The Lady Iseult is in the nursery dormitory.\" At my questioning glance, Mother Abbess continued. \"We have a small orphanage here at the Convent. Lady Iseult helps with the babies at bedtime.\" She took me along yet another interminable corridor, ushered me into a largish chamber and left me. It held some small beds and several small stools. Though it was not yet dark, heavy curtains were already partly drawn at the windows. Isolda was bending over a cradle shushing a babe. There were two more asleep in high sided cots. Three young children were running about and an even younger one shuffling across the room on its bottom. Two serving maids stood at a table, folding small garments. Isolda stood. She had changed her clothes from the cream linen habit to a turquoise gown under a tabard of darkest blue. Her hair was caught up in a gold net and covered with a small fine violet veil held in place by a narrow gold circlet. The bottom-shuffling child had reached her feet and was attempting to pull itself up to stand by her gown. It mumbled something. She smiled, reached down and lifted the child up into her arms. It patted her face. \"Mama.\" it said. My stunned glance met hers. The babe, realising it did not have her full attention, turned to see who did. I knew its face. I knew its eyes. It pulled off its night cap, uncovering dark feathery curls. I lost the breath from my body and the room swung around. \"No! No, sweeting! Cap on, sleepy time now.\" She put the babe into a high sided cot, tucking the woollen blankets about it, whispering softly. She blew a kiss to the child, and murmuring something to the maids, led me in silence back along the corridor to the guest solar where we had first met. She took a spill from the hearth to light two candles on the mantel shelf. She stood, her back to the wall, her hands pressed hard into it. \"The child.\" It was a statement not a question. She did not reply. \"You chose not to send word to me?\" I could hear the roughness of anger in my voice. She straightened, her head high, bright patches of colour on her cheeks. \"Should I have done so, my Lord? Have you forgotten your last words to me? I have not! 'I do not believe you.' y ou said. \" \"This is different!\" \" Is it?\" I bowed my head. Her answer drove out my anger. Mortification came first, then jealousy took its place, tearing through me again as dreadful as those first days. \"Did you send him word?\" I whispered. \"Why should I do that? He is nothing to me.\" I tried to find some sense in the turmoil that was my mind. \"And I? Was I nothing to you? I chewed the inside of my cheek trying to think what to say next. \"Since Arthur died, I have tried to mend his kingdom and mine. To bind them together against our country's enemies. It has been hard. I thought I might be able to do it with you by my side. I hoped that you would return to Castle D'Or with me. I need you with me. \" \"And your offer is now withdrawn?\" \"Sweet God!\" I turned to the window resting my forehead against the mullions. \" No. Christos, no. Isolda, why are you doing this? Is this a test? Are you playing games with me or exacting a cruel punishment?\" I said barely above a whisper. \" God only knows the misery my life has been without you.\" \"And the child?\" I turned back. \"The child! You need to ask? Do you think I am blind? Its name is written on its face. My face, my eyes, my hair.\" \" I see it every day. I do not need you to tell me, I knew that summer. Before Tristan returned from Breidzh.\" \"You knew you carried? You said nothing.\" My tone was slow and accusing. \"It was too soon. Anything might have happened. So much did happen.\" In my mind's eye, I saw my hand splayed against her face, pushing her down until she fell on the cell floor. Christos, forgive me. I moved slowly across the room to stand before her. For the first time this day, her eyes held mine, clear and honest, sparkling with unshed tears. \" Forgive me! For all that has happened. The child... It \" She laid her fingers on my mouth. \"I love you, Marke. I have never stopped loving you. If you want me, I will come. But the babe, if you keep saying it ...I think I might slap you. His, him. Not it. He is a boy.\" Her lovely mouth curved in a small smile. Not for the first time that day, my breath left my body. In the shock of the last hour, I had given no thought to the babe as a living breathing child. A boy. \"What is he called?\" \"He is named for his father and his Grandfather. Marke Constantine Cunomorus but he answers to Merlin.\" .~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~~*~~~~~. .

It belongs to its respected owner. I do own the twins and the plot. 'Nuff said. Italics are flashbacks and thoughts. A/N: I was watching the movie Tristan & Isolde earlier today and thought of this idea. Summary: AU: Tristan and Isolde are married and she's expecting her first child. She and Tristan start talking about names and the only ones they can agree on are Alyse and Lysander. When Isolde delivers twins, they get their wish about names. One-Shot. Rated T because I'm paranoid. Genre: Romance/Drama Rating: T New husband and wife Tristan and Isolde looked up into the night sky and pointed out the different constellations. Tristan found Orion and Tarus, while Isolde pointed out the summer triangle. She wasn't as good as finding constellations as well as Tristan was, but she was learning. \" Oh look! A shooting star!\" Isolde exclaimed, pointing out the shooting star. \"Father says that if you see a shooting star, you should wish on it.\" \" I wish to be with you forever and have twenty children with you.\" Tristan said, his tone teasing. Isolde rolled her beautiful blue-green eyes and kissed the end of his nose. Conceiving a child was a lot of work, but within a year, Isolde was pregnant, according to the physician. Tristan smiled at his beautiful bride and held her close, afraid to let her go. Tristan looked at his beautiful bride as she slept. He watched her swollen stomach rise and fall with each breath. Carefully, Tristan took her in his arms and held her close. Isolde opened her eyes and looked into her husband's kind brown eyes. She kissed his lips as he gently kissed hers. \"Well, someone's awake.\" Tristan teased as they broke apart. He then looked at her swollen stomach and placed his hands on it. \"She keeps moving and won't let me rest.\" Isolde told him. \"She?\" Tristan asked, raising an eyebrow. \"I had a dream last night that an angel came to me and told me I was to have a daughter.\" Isolde explained. \"What if I want a son?\" Tristan inquired. \"There's always next time, Tristan. Or maybe the angel will be wrong.\" \"I don't care what you have – I will always love you.\" Tristan told his beloved. Suddenly, Isolde squinted her eyes in pain and grabbed her stomach. Tristan looked at her dress and saw that it was damp. He then gathered Isolde in his arms and laid her on the bed and sat next to her. She grunted in pain as the physician arrived and placed himself in front of Isolde. Isolde was in labor for the rest of the day and well into the night screaming in pain. Tristan felt useless, for there was nothing he could do. He stayed with Isolde, holding her and singing her some soothing songs, hoping it would help. Tristan had dozed off, but was awakened by a soft little noise. He opened his eyes and saw Isolde nursing a little bundle, but quickly handed it to Tristan as she pushed another life into the world. \"You have a daughter and a son.\" The physician told Tristan and Isolde. Tristan kissed the top of Isolde's head and looked at the new bundle in her arms. It was a boy. The one that he held was a girl. \"What shall we name them?\" Tristan asked Isolde as she nursed the two babies at the same time. \"What do you think of Alyse and Lysander?\" Isolde whispered, adjusting her hold on the babies. \"I love it and I love you.\" Tristan told his bride. \"Would you like to hold one?\" Isolde inquired. Tristan nodded as Isolde handed him Alyse. Tristan smiled at the infant in his arms, cradling her so that she wouldn't fall. Three years later, Tristan and Isolde became parents again. They were so happy when Isolde delivered a little boy. Isolde let Tristan name him, since she had named the twins. \"I wish to name him Marke, after the man who raised me when my parents died.\" Tristan told Isolde. Isolde nodded and continued nursing Marke. Three years after that, Isolde delivered their last child, giving her children – Alyse, Lysander and Marke – and husband, Tristan, a daughter. \"Luna, since she was born on a full moon.\" Tristan told Isolde. Isolde smiled weakly and nursed Luna. He exited the room and looked at his children. Alyse and Marke looked like him, while Lysander looked like Isolde. Tristan was anxious to see who Luna would look like. Tristan and Isolde had no more children after Luna. When Luna was two years of age, Isolde died of fever. Tristan was left alone with four children, all of whom he loved with all his heart. Isolde was Tristan's life and he felt it would be wrong to move on. It wasn't until the summer that the twins turned seven that Tristan fell in love again. He was in the market, getting some food for his children when he saw a beautiful maiden on the other side of the vegetable cart. She had ivory skin and long black hair that she wore in a braid that ended in the middle of her back. She wore a long-sleeved gray dress with hints of pink, blue and cream sewn in. When she smiled at him, he saw that she had kind brown eyes. She dropped her basket and Tristan went to retrieve it for her. \"You are most kind, sir.\" She spoke with the voice of an angel. \"You are welcome, madame.\" Tristan told her. \"What do they call you?\" \"Juliette.\" \"I am Tristan. Would you like an escort home?\" \"Oh, no thank you – I only live five minutes from here.\" \"That would give me five minutes to get to know you.\" Juliette smiled and allowed Tristan to escort her home. It wasn't long before Tristan felt himself fall in love with this woman. She reminded him so much of Isolde – the music in her laughter, for one thing. Another thing was her curiosity, which seemed never-ending. Also, her kindness to Tristan and his children. They were alone in Tristan's bedroom, Juliette was on the bed and Tristan was at the door, waiting until the nurse put Luna to bed. Tristan then closed the door and made his way over to Juliette. They made love well into the night and part of the next morning. Tristan smiled as he watched her sleep. He brushed her long hair aside and kissed her cheek. The two of them were wed the night of the full moon in July. There was a glorious bonfire and lively music. Juliette laughed as Tristan spun her around as they danced. Tristan looked over his shoulder and saw his children dancing with each other. All four of them loved Juliette like she was their own mother, which Tristan was happy about. Nine months later Juliette woke up sweating and damp. She looked over at Tristan, who was fast asleep. Juliette gently shook Tristan awake and he lit the candle on their bedside table. He looked at Juliette's gown and saw it was damp, along with the sheets under her. \"Nurse! Go fetch the physician! Juliette's going to deliver tonight.\" Tristan told the nurse, being quiet so that he wouldn't wake up the children. He then went back to the bedroom and sat beside Juliette, hoping that she would be all right. It was towards dawn that Juliette gave one final push and a soft noise filled Tristan's ears. He knew what that was – it was a baby crying. \"What is it?\" Tristan asked, stretching and yawning. \"A beautiful, healthy little girl.\" Juliette whispered, looking down at her little girl. Tristan smiled and kissed the top of Juliette's head as the physician wrapped the baby in a blanket and handed her to Juliette. \"What do you want to name her?\" Tristan inquired. \"What was your wife's name before you met me?\" \"Isolde.\" \"Then that's what we'll name her – Isolde.\" \"No, Juliette – it'll bring back too many memories if we name her that.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"It's all right. We'll name her something else.\" \"Do you like the name Lily at all?\" \"I think it's beautiful. Ow! I have severe pain in my back.\" Tristan carefully rolled Juliette on her side and massaged her back. Tristan could see the contractions searing through Juliette's tiny body. He then carefully sat her up and sat behind her, resting his hands on either side of her stomach. Juliette rested her head on his shoulder and sucked in some air as Tristan helped her deliver. Ten minutes later, Juliette held another baby in her arms – this one a little boy. The two of them instantly agreed on the name Jacob for their new edition. Tristan kissed the top of Juliette's head as she slept. They only had a short time before the babies woke up and demanded attention. Tristan now had the perfect family. He had his beautiful wife, Juliette, and their six children – Alyse, Lysander, Marke, Luna, Lily and Jacob. As Juliette tended to the babies, Tristan could hear his and Isolde's voices in his head as they wished upon the star so many years ago. \" Oh look! A shooting star!\" Isolde exclaimed, pointing out the shooting star. \"Father says that if you see a shooting star, you should wish on it.\" \" I wish to be with you forever and have twenty children with you.\" Tristan said. He hoped that wherever Isolde was, she was all right and safe. ","Summary":" Disclaimer – I own nothing of Tristan & Isolde. It belongs to its respected owner.

He took a breath, and then another. Another yet. But the pain did not diminish, did not recede, surging against him, suffocating, like the lashes of the storm-churned tide. Flickers of light still beckoned from the tower window, his disobedient eyes turning towards it despite his own admonishment. \" I'll pretend it's you.\" Her words seared with fire and ice, eating away at him, upending all he thought he knew, all he had striven to become. He would not give way to such imaginings, seeing her and him – them – in such close proximity, his grasp upon her pale skin, his breath mingling with hers. He hated Marke, almost as much as he hated himself. But how could he not think of her, just has he had every night since he had glimpsed her through a fevered haze? She consumed him, even now, as another man's wife. He closed his eyes against the memory of the beach at Dunluce, the sea as green as her measured gaze, her skin warm against his hand even through the textured fabric of her gown. He had meant to keep that moment forever, as one keeps a treasured jewel in a casket of silver, looking at it time and again with a small smile of remembrance. But now it would never be a joy, only a curse upon him, damned as he was to anger and regret. He is stark mad, who ever says, That he hath been in love an hour, Yet not that love so soon decays, But that it can ten in less space devour; Who will believe me, if I swear That I have had the plague a year? Who would not laugh at me, if I should say I saw a flask of powder burn a day? The tower chamber held a strange foreboding, yet even as she sat next to him she knew what was to come. How absurd it was to pretend otherwise, as if she was ignorant of the act that would soon follow. As if her skin did not already know the touch of its true and rightful claimant. \" Come with me!\" She heard his voice even now, etched with longing and hope, as their bodies clung to the side of the boat, yet it was difficult for her to recall why she had refused him. Perhaps she had wished to show him that his talk of duty had moved her to keep faith with her own promises, to prove that she was not solely guided by the wants of her heart. But what did it matter, in the end? All their obligations had been kept, yet it had only brought them grief. Marke was speaking to her, words meant to comfort, to quell her fears. But even as he brushed away a plait of hair, or reached for her hand, she knew he could not truly touch her, not when her heart was so very far from this place. Her body had been pledged to him, nothing more. She owed him her loyalty, but not her love. She willed herself not to think, especially not of him , where he might be, if he was thinking of her. And as Marke leaned down to kiss her, she shut her eyes, the darkness clouding her mind into oblivion. Ah, what a trifle is a heart, If once into love's hands it come! All other griefs allow a part To other griefs, and ask themselves but some; They come to us, but us Love draws, He swallows us, and never chaws: By him, as by chain'd shot, whole ranks to die, He is the tyrant pike, our hearts the fry. Every muscle in his frame burned, urging him to burst into their chamber, offer his hand, and steal her away, to a place so far from the world that they would never be found. Had she not asked him to do so already, her pleading ringed with a veil of tears? All thoughts of home, all consideration of honor and duty, all would be lost within her eyes, within her touch upon him. But it could not be. To destroy everything he had helped create in order to have her would simply trade one tragedy for another. They had not spoken since that afternoon on the ship; he could not even meet her eye. Even as he had seen her last, bedecked in wedding finery, resplendent as the silvery Goddess born from the sea, even as he had watched her eyes flit about, quietly searching for his, he did not dare. He stood as a man half-dead, who moves and breathes by force of will alone. How could he stay to watch her be paraded around as a captive prize, to see them eat from the same dish, drink from the same cup, take their leave at night's end and disappear together into a darkened room? But then how could he go, leave his home, forsake the only life he had ever really known? \" We will live with this. We must.\" This remained the painful answer to the riddle of his divided self. His heart must be hardened, the invisible cords that still bound them together put to the sword. If 'twere not so, what did become Of my heart, when I first saw thee? I brought a heart into the room, But from the room, I carried none with me: If it had gone to thee, I know Mine would have taught thine heart to show More pity unto me: but Love, alas! At one first blow did shiver it as glass. She fell back against the bed, Marke's hand fumbling with the laces of her robe, and her heart ached at both his awkwardness and visible need. Could she transform herself, transform this place, the bed linens she lay upon, until at last she might trace her fingers against the sand, feel the tang of the salt sea within her lungs? His breath was heavy on her neck, his lips whispering across her skin, as she trembled in excitement and fear. She turned upward to meet his mouth with hers, surprised by her own urgency, the desire to feel every part of him with every part of herself. Even so, she wanted more, so much that somehow they would wholly cease to be themselves, but be lost and intermingled within each other. He paused to look down at her, her palm still flat against the rough pounding of his heart, his eyes questioning, waiting. She acquiesced with a small nod, not trusting in words, as she pulled him down into her ready arms. A fire soon coursed through her, an ache so strong she thought she might weep. With every movement the conflagration spread, consuming her, until at last, she was released, her body sensing that it had devoured and been devoured in turn. \" How do you feel?\" Where the words real, or was she only remembering them? And if she did not open her eyes, how was she to know the difference? Yet nothing can to nothing fall, Nor any place be empty quite, Therefore I think my breast hath all Those pieces still, though they be not unite; And now as broken glasses show A hundred lesser faces, so My rags of heart can like, wish, and adore But after one such love, can love no more. He remembered holding her close within his arms, her skin still warm and flushed, until they had both been lost to sleep, even as the long shadows of twilight stretched across the churning of the sea. He had woken with a start to find her gone, the space beside him cool and empty, the embers of the burned-out fire trailing tiny wisps of smoke. Yet even in the darkness he had been unable to return to sleep. In the morning she had come for him, her voice turned thick with fear. She could not go with him, she had claimed, and only the pale harsh daylight had been witness to their separation. The sea had brought him to her, under a mask of death, and it bore him away just as simply. For all his plans and schemes, for his love-sick notion to win not only Marke a wife in Ireland but himself as well, to bring her back to Cornwall as his own, where they might forever relive those days and nights they had discovered each other among the chatter of shorebirds and the ocean's roar – what did they all come to? Were they merely playthings of Fortune? What would become of them, in the end? He knew, in his heart, that theirs was a story that would offer little pleasure in the telling. He glanced up again at the window: the light was gone, put out, the shroud of darkness total.

Peering up at the darkness, Isolde knew what was expected of her. Behind her, her new husband, lord and now King Marke laid waiting, as he watched her. Isolde felt more on edge now than she did when she first set eyes on Tristan again. Standing from the seat she'd been so nervous to leave watching the fighters come and go. She could remember the tears that slid silently down her face as she believed she would never meet her love again. Then that moment came when she finally looked on at the fighters and saw him. Her Tristan, fighting so fiercely. Tired, but winning. Her heart leapt when she saw him. Could she be betrothed to him? Could she be allowed by the Gods to be with the man who had stolen her heart not so long ago? All those questions were answered in one swoop, as her father told her Tristan was fighting for another. Her heart shattered at that moment. The moment their eyes met again she felt that her body was on fire and willed the ocean to drown the pain away. Though no relief came, he didn't speak up as she screamed in mind for him to when she was stood beside Marke. He didn't even glance at her again that evening. If only he knew that the only reason that she was even here, and not in his arms, was the threat of a war. Her life, her love, her heart had been bargained for to stop a war between her home land Ireland and Cornwall. She ran her fingers through her now dry hair and turned toward Marke. Her heart pounded rhythmically in her chest. Commanding her to turn and leave. To run to Tristan and be by his side, even if she could manage to leave Marke here. She couldn't and wouldn't risk Tristan's life. Surly he would be killed if anyone discovered them. She felt trapped. The lightness of Markes eyes seemed to echo years of pain. Of the war of what he lost though as she looked at him that was evident. His hand had been cut off when he protected the boy who would have later grown up to become her lover. Crossing the room slowly she tried to create a smile out of her sorrow. She felt much like she did the day she had watched her mother leave her life forever. She wanted the ground to open up and swallow her whole. She pleaded with her heart to calm down as she drew in a deep shaky breathe. The smell of mead was heavy in the air as well as the smell of crushed flowers. Glancing nervously around she could feel Markes eyes follow her own. First to the door again and this caused him to sit up slowly. \"Isolde\" he stood up and crossed the small space between them and turned her face staring down into her eyes. \" I do not expect anything from you\" his thumb dragged over her skin. He could compare it to milky satin. Her eyes a summer blue. His fingers dragged over her cheek and her eyes fell shut. She cursed herself at that moment realising it must have persuaded him that he was relaxing her when her body seemed to be on fire even more so now he let his fingers touch her. He bent down for one moment and breathed in. As nervous as any man would be, though to him, this was right. He had never fallen in love before like this. He knew after the short amount of time they had spent together today that he would move mountains for her if he could only see her smile that could light up his darkest of nights. Her breathing washed over him as he moved closer his hand now cupping her face. He hooked his arm around her waist and drew her closer to him before he allowed his lips to find hers. The kiss lasted only a second for Marke. The taste of fruit on her lips, her scent overwhelmed him and he only wanted more now that he had allowed himself this indulgence. For Isolde, it felt too long. Her eyes started to fill with tears that she felt threateningly close to spilling out. She wouldn't pull away that night. She should have pushed him away but instead she drew him in slowly. Praying that he would never know she had already been with another. She lay awake that night after Marke fell asleep holding her, she managed to slide out of his arms and dress. She pulled on a discarded shirt of Markes and a dark cape wrapping it around herself she made her way out of the castle down to the Roman bridge she had seen when she arrived here. When she got there she sat down by the rivers embankment and sobbed. She sobbed until the morning birds started to sing to her. She forced herself to her feet and returned to what seemed like a prison to her more now than ever. Tristan lay awake that night. Unable to sleep, the mindless amount of images that ran through his consciousness threatened to destroy his sanity. Nothing seemed to make his desire for Isolde leave his mind. Nothing seemed to help the longing that he carried for the angel that saved him, that's how he saw her. As an angel sent to love him. Those precious days he shared with her had given his life meaning and to leave her brought back the agony that he never realised he felt ever since he lost his mother and father. The agony of emptiness, nothingness, of a meaningless life. Tristan knew he had to stop loving Isolde. It wasn't just him that would be prosecuted if anyone were to find out their love. Isolde would be banished or worse killed. He couldn't give her that fate he had to protect her as much as he could and in protecting her he was hurting her by not holding her. Everything seemed so confusing to him. His mind lingered on smiles they shared. Of the last bitter kiss they stole before she sent him away from his haven and into what he now deemed a life sentence of misery. This was too much for him to bare. He got himself up and walked out of his quarters, snatching up his sword; He stepped into the courtyard and looked around at what he knew he helped create. Markes kingdom. Marke is a great man. He raised Tristan like a son, more like a brother. Tristan walked down into the courtyard and raised his sword. Swinging it he fell into movements he knew well. Ever since he was a child the militancy of his future had been embedded into his soul. He was born destined to serve for duty, honour, and he knew that if he stopped for one moment everything he once held dear would fade away. Nothing could overthrow the way he felt about Isolde but he knew he had to deny everything. Or the kingdom would fall. The morning came far to fast for Tristan the sun broke through the thick clouds to beat down on his chest. His shirt discarded on the ground. Servants scurried from courtyard to castle to market every now and then not taking a second glance as Tristan trained. Taking his frustration out on the air. Swinging his sword violently more and more until finally throwing it, Causing it to embed into the wooden wall that surrounded him. He walked to his shirt and pulled it on slowly his muscles ached badly. The reoccurring ache of his now healed wound ran through him every now and then. Even when he thought of Isolde he thought he felt it ache. He sat down against the hard wood and slumped down into the earth. His hair falling over his eyes as he closed them slowly. \"Tristan\" the angels voice called for him to leave the dream he had fallen into. The dream that he had never left Ireland, that he lived with his beautiful Isolde. He forced his eyes to open and then saw her. Isolde wrapped in a cloak shivering near violently looking at him. Her eyes a brilliant blue had faded and clouded over. She looked like she was about to die. He stood up. It was still early and he couldn't help but want to hold her. He nearly stumbled toward her. His legs resisting still aching from the way that he had pushed himself. \"You shouldn't be here\" he reasoned with himself. Telling Isolde this and seeing her stand her ground was something he knew in his heart he wanted to see. \"Tristan…\" She said again. Her eyes scanning over his chest slowly to the scar of the wound she had attended to. \" I…\" she paused and moved toward him the cloak falling open exposing the shirt she wore. It ripped at Tristan faster than he could realise what was happening. He shook his head and backed away. The shirt was just a shirt, but it wasn't it. It was Markes. He shook his head from side to side over and over refusing to say a word to her. \" You should go inside\" he looked up desperate to find a maid or servant that could help her in. He couldn't touch her. If he did… he sighed and looked at her. The brilliant defiant nature he once saw had weakened so strongly so quickly. \" Isolde\" he breathed. His voice filled with a sorrow he couldn't let free. If he did it would never stop. \" I can't… \"Isolde eyes were desperately searching his. Needing to see if he still felt the same. \" If…If we could be away from this… if we could be away from Marke.. away from responsibility and duty would you be with me?\" her voice shook as her body trembled and she moved the cloak over her as tightly her body relentlessly shaking. \"Isolde!\" Markes voice cut through the air in urgency. Tristan instantly froze. Her eyes looked directly at him ignoring Marke completely. Oblivious to how this must look to him she sighed shivering more. Marke moved down the steps and crossed the area his arms wrapped tightly around her \" you're freezing!\" He remarked worried as her body shook harder. Tristan watched in envy, in annoyance and in pain, his eyes scanning the area. Marke turned Isolde and slowly led her inside. Whispering into her ear.

Surely you know of another great fighter under your command who is seeking a wife. One who is a bit closer to my own age.\" \"You need not worry, Isolde. Your mother was nearly twenty years younger than I when we were wed. I have promised Morholt a wife upon his return, and I shall see to it that he receives one. The matter is settled.\" \"But Father- \"Did I not say the matter was settled?\" Donnchadh thrust his goblet of mead aside, his tone gruff. \"Unless you claim to know better.\" \"I believe I do, actually,\" Isolde boldly countered, her eyes narrowing. \"Isolde!\" Bragnae hissed sharply. \"Is that so?\" Donnchadh smirked, meeting Isolde's glare. With a swift motion, he struck her across the cheek. She staggered for an instant but did not fall, as Bragnae rushed toward her, grabbing her wrist and leading her towards the door. \"Bragnae,\" he added, \"perhaps you can see to it that she is rid of this impudence before her wedding day.\" \"Yes, my king,\" Bragnae replied with a slight bow, whisking Isolde out of Donnchadh's quarters. \"You mustn't speak to him so, Isolde! How many times have I told you that?\" Bragnae scolded as they ventured outside. \"Why must I be subjected to a miserable existence like that of my mother?\" Isolde sighed with frustration, blazing quickly towards the stables. \"Isolde! Where are you going?\" Bragnae demanded breathlessly, trying to keep pace with her. \"Off to see that curly-locked 'prisoner' of yours once again, aren't you? If your father gets word of this, he'll have both our heads,\" she continued as Isolde mounted her trusted horse. \"I have matters to attend to here, but I'll be down there shortly thereafter. Do you hear me?\" \"Yes, Bragnae. I'll see you a bit later, then,\" Isolde grumbled, turning away and riding swiftly to the shore. Isolde dismounted, peeking through the wide slats of the wooden door to the hut, clutching a cluster of fresh berries in one hand, which she had stopped to pick along the way. \"Up here!\" She glanced upward to see Tristan sitting atop the hill into which the hut was carved, fashioning a shell necklace to match the wristlet he had given her before. He leapt down, wrapping his arms around Isolde in a tight embrace, then escorting her into the hut, pushing the wooden door aside. \"I thought you might like these,\" Isolde smiled warmly, eagerly handing the bunch of berries to Tristan as they made their way inside. \"Thank you,\" he replied, smiling as he plucked a few and tossed them into his mouth, savoring their sweetness. \"Delicious. Here, have some,\" he graciously offered. \"It's alright, thank you. I had quite a few myself on the way.\" She glanced around the hut, noting that he could use a bit more firewood. \"You have those while I go gather some sticks for the fire.\" Isolde returned a short while later, placing the bundle of branches aside. She had also brought with her her favorite book of poetry, from which she liked to read to Tristan. Sitting down next to him, she opened the book and started to read. Tristan gazed lovingly at her, his dark brown eyes marveling at her pretty gray-green dress, her delicate hands and wrists, her beautiful blonde hair tied back in a braid. She began, \"Stay, O sweet and do not rise! The light that shines comes from thine eyes; The day breaks not: it is my heart, Because that you and I must part. Stay! or else my joys will die And perish in their infancy.\" Isolde glanced up at him, her blue eyes twinkling, a sweet smile illuminating her face. Suddenly Tristan's expression grew concerned. \"Bragnae, what happened?\" he asked, his tone worried. \"What do you mean, what happened?\" Isolde responded, puzzled. \"Your cheek…it's red!\" Isolde immediately realized he had seen where Donnchadh had slapped her earlier that morning. She didn't want Tristan to worry about her. \"Is it? Perhaps I was in the sun a bit too long,\" Isolde tried to reassure him, forcing a smile. But Tristan saw right through it. \"Bragnae,\" he spoke gently. \"Who hit you?\" Isolde's face fell, her eyes cast downward. She was so touched by his kindness her eyes welled with tears. \"It's alright. You can tell me.\" He took her hands, covering them with his own. She decided to be honest, although without disclosing that Donnchadh was actually her father. \"King Donnchadh. I tried to speak my concerns to him about my betrothed, but he said it is settled.\" \"I'm so sorry he did this to you.\" Tristan's face was lined with sympathy, tinged with a hint of anger. \"It's alright. I shouldn't have – \"Shhh,\" he comforted her. Taking her face in his hands, he wiped away the tears that had fallen from her eyes with his thumbs. Tenderly, he caressed her left cheek, his thumb gliding over the welts. He then leaned forward, planting sweet, gentle kisses on her cheek, moving upward to her forehead, back down to the opposite cheek, and to the tip of her nose. He then lifted up her chin with his hand. Overwhelmed with emotion, she willed herself to meet his eyes for a brief second, closing them again as his lips met hers, faintly tasting the sweet berries he had consumed a short while earlier. He drew her warm, delicate body closer to him. Isolde nestled her face in the crook of his arm, breathing in his woodsy, comforting smell. She closed her eyes as Tristan held her and stroked her hair. Perhaps, she thought, she could rest here for a while. She knew she couldn't stay forever, but she felt so safe here, so loved. Just a little while longer, she hoped, as she fell into a deep sleep.

Recently, I started watching the show Merlin . In curiosity, I went to look up some of the characters connected to the Arthurian Legend in order to satisfy some questions that I had only to realize that Tristan and Isolde, names I recognized from a movie I never watched, were connected to King Arthur. Wanting to learn more, I decided to watch the film. Now, granted, I am aware of the movie's flaws, but the story behind it - the legend - was too powerful to deny. I was captured by it, and my thoughts would not leave the film when it ended. Twice. Since then, not only have I written this piece (whether there will be more Tristan and Isolde stories from me in the future, I do not know yet), but I've also read the first two novels in the Isolde trilogy by Rosalind Miles. Needless to say, I do not believe this will be a mere passing fancy. On one last note, if you're unfamiliar with the tale but curious because of either what I said here or because you enjoy my other stories, the entire movie is posted on youtube in, if I recall correctly, twelve parts, or, if you've already seen the film, it's well worth a second watch. Thanks and, as always, enjoy! ~Charlynn~ Through Death, Love; Through Love, Immortality A Tristan and Isolde One Shot Ireland was nothing like his home in Britain. Instead of small hills and valleys, their lands canopied with the lush boughs of heavily foliaged trees, sunlight filtering through the leaves like dancing, carefree raindrops, Ireland was a land of steep, sheer cliffs and grassy plateaus. The ground beneath his feet seemed to move with the influence of the wind, ebbing and flowing to the point where man became one with his surroundings. It was louder, for the wide, open expanses welcomed the roar of the sea and embraced the echoes of life that floated upon the breeze. So different, yet, in a way that Castle D'Or had never been able to, it whispered a sense of belonging to Tristan, reminded him of his long left behind but never forgotten home at Castle Tantallon. Or perhaps it was the woman from Ireland who rescued him which made the foreign lands so unexplainably familiar. No matter what the explanation, there was no denying the fact that for the last several days his father had been heavily weighing upon his mind, not so much his death and wanting retribution for it like it had for so long but rather a new appreciation for his father's hopes and dreams, a new interpretation as to why his father had fought so passionately to unite the tribes of Britain. Yes, his father had felt a duty to his land and his people, and, yes, he had wanted to end their suffering at the hands of the lording Irish and return to Britain its lost honor, but, more importantly, Tristan now realized that his father had wanted to bring peace and prosperity to their home because of his love for his family. While duty and honor were important, they meant nothing without love, without belonging irrevocably to someone and fighting to protect and keep them safe. Being in Ireland, meeting the woman who had both saved his life and, by showing him love, had shown him what it really meant to be alive for the first time since he had been a mere child, Tristan finally knew what true and honest tranquility felt like. It wasn't the knowledge that you had successfully routed your enemy, it wasn't the thrill of victory following a battle, and it certainly wasn't gaining another step towards unifying Britain; it was doing all of these things and more for one's family, for those that one loved. For Tristan now, it was Isolde. \"Come with me.\" He could see the desire, the yearning to do what he asked in her eyes, but, yet, she still denied him. \"I can't.\" \"Why not,\" Tristan demanded to know. \"We both know this cannot be, Tristan.\" Tears clouded her voice, choking it; a silent sob of desperation ricocheted through her anguished blue gaze. \"We knew it from the start. That doesn't mean it wasn't true, it is.\" He didn't understand her argument. Yes, she was Irish, and he was a Briton, but those weren't insurmountable odds. Why was she so adamant that they couldn't be together? He knew that she did not love her betrothed. If she left with him, she wouldn't be forced to marry someone she didn't love, and he knew that Marke would welcome her into his home simply because he, Tristan, loved her, Irish heritage or not. And who was to say that anyone even had to know where she came from? They could make it work; they could be together... if only she'd agree to leave with him. \"I don't understand,\" he finally confessed after several silence filled, tense moments between them. With the angry waves rocking them against the small boat which would serve as his means of escape, hopefully their means of escape, they seemed to move closer and closer together, as though the ocean was insisting that they remain as one. Fueled by both his need to have her with him and his need to keep them both safe, Tristan rushed forward, \"as just a lady of the court, surely it is not your duty which prevents you from....\" \"I am not a mere lady of the court,\" she confessed upon a whisper. Despite the churning of the water, he could easily hear her soft admission. \"I lied. I am Isolde, daughter to King Donnchadh and Princess of Ireland.\" Without second thought, he immediately said, \"I don't care.\" \"Wha... what,\" she stumbled upon her words, obviously shocked by his lack of hard feelings towards either her deception or her true identity. \"But surely, especially after the things you told me about your parents, you couldn't still want.... It would never work. If your family ever found out, if my father ever learned of....\" Again, he interrupted her. \"So we lie. Your name, the fact that you are the Princess of Ireland does not make you the woman that you are, the woman who cared for me, nursed me back to health, told me of her hopes and dreams, despite the fact that she knew me to be her enemy.\" \"You were never my enemy, Tristan; you couldn't be.\" \"So, then leave here with me. Return with me to my home, become my wife, and live your life the way you wish to, not the way your father demands of you.\" \"It'll never be that simple,\" Isolde continued to argue, but he could see her wavering. Her eyes didn't appear so hopeless, and her hands were gripping the sides of the small boat as if it was the only thing in her world that made any sense. \"We'll constantly be looking over our shoulders, wondering when someone is going to discover our secret. If we do this, I'll be putting your life at further risk, both from my father and your own people.\" \"And, if we don't, you'll be miserable, forced to marry someone you don't love, and I'll grow bitter with resentment and jealousy, hating what was and yearning for what might have been.\" Sensing she needed one last push, one more reason to fight for what she wanted, he admitted, \"if you don't come with me now, I'll just find a way to return to you later. Betrothed or married, you belong with me, just as I belong to you. I won't give up on you, Isolde, so don't give up on us.\" \"This is insane,\" she breathed out tempestuously. In answer, Tristan simply elevated himself into the boat, smiled, and held out his hand. When he felt her soft, delicate fingers being placed against his own work worn and forever scarred digits, he lifted her out of the water easily, settling her beside him as quickly as he could before placing the oars and pushing off. While he might have been returning to D'Or and Britain, with Isolde he was already home. It had been two days since she had last seen Isolde, since the boat had returned from Britain bearing just three of their men with news of both the loss of the battle and the loss of dozens of Irish lives, since she had warned her young charge and Isolde had set off to help the young Tristan of Aragon escape. Though a part of her feared for the Princess' life, the other part of Bragnae knew exactly what had happened to the impetuous girl and wished her nothing but love and happiness. \"Still, you have received no word from my daughter? I know she has been prone to wandering off on her own in the past.\" \"While this is true, never before has she been away for so long by herself,\" she answered her King. He was seated before her, insolently lounging on his throne that was secluded in shadows, his ferocious rage and power nearly driving her to her knees in supplication, but, still, despite her fear, she managed to keep her wits about her somehow, never once lying but omitting key facts. \"Usually, she returns by nightfall, but two have passed since I last laid eyes upon Isolde.\" \"And her usual haunts, those places you have found her hiding at before?\" \"Searched.\" \"Searched and what, Bragnae,\" King Donnchadh roared. \"Was anything found?\" \"Not a trace of her.\" \"So, you're saying that my daughter has vanished, that you have lost Ireland's Princess, my one and only child and heir?\" Meekly, she responded, \"it appears that way, I'm afraid.\" Surprising her, he relented somewhat. \"Ah, but then there is the Briton cur to account for. We still haven't been able to find him, and the wreckage of his boat was discovered close to the shore where Isolde was known to walk from time to time. Do you think, Bragnae, that is is possible that my daughter was taken against her will, perhaps even back to Britain as a prisoner?\" \"I'm sure anything is possible, but I, for one, would like to think that nothing of the kind happened to her.\" Tentatively, for she did not want to either tip the King off or anger him further, she suggested, \"perhaps she ran away. Isolde was not shy about expressing her objections towards her upcoming nuptials. Maybe when she heard news of the boat's return from Britain, she ran off, seeing it as her last means of escaping a marriage she did not want.\" \"It is another option to consider. However, if nothing else, my daughter is a recognizable figure. Even those who have never seen her before have heard of the beautiful Princess Isolde, heir to all of Ireland. Someone will spot her, word will spread, and, when it does, I promise you this, Bragnae: your mistress will be coming home.\" Knowing when she has been dismissed, Bragnae curtsied hurried before scrambling away, eager to be as far from the King as she possibly could get. While she had no doubt that his words were true, she hoped that Isolde was smarter than her father gave her credit for, because, if not, if she had believed her life miserable before she ran off with the Briton, then she didn't even want to imagine what Isolde's reaction would be to her new life should her father find her and return her to Ireland once more. For everyone's sake, Bragnae hoped that she would never see the Princess again. Tristan's people weren't suspicious of her ; they were suspicious of her. To Isolde's immense surprise, they never questioned her name (they had decided on Rhiannon, a Welsh name with mystical tendencies, for Bragnae was too entirely Irish), they weren't curious about her appearance (though they had stopped and bartered away her own dress for a more ill-fitting, less regal appearing gown on their way to Castle D'Or), and no one even blinked when told that her father had been dead since before her birth, she didn't even recall his name, and that she and her mother had lived alone in a quiet seaside cottage, stranded from the rest of Britain by miles of uninhabited woods and rocky shoreline. No one glanced at her hands to see if they really were work-hardened from years upon years of harsh, grueling manual labor... which they weren't, and she was still nervous that the other women would ask for advice on how to grow certain plants or what was the best way to prepare a specific kind of fish. However, she had agreed with Tristan that his proposed cover story was the best possible one available to them. Now, they just had to execute it properly in order to shy away from the questions neither of them could properly answer. Perhaps to their advantage, though, the leader of D'Or, Marke, Tristan's uncle for all intents and purposes, the man who spoke for his entire village, seemed more concerned with their plans to marry than whether or not Isolde was the woman she claimed to be. Though he had pulled Tristan aside to speak to him privately, their voices carried. Everyone present, practically the entire town due to the joyous, miraculous return of their warrior hero, could hear every word that passed between the man she was in love with and the man that he loved as a father. \"Tristan you have no idea how happy I am that you are alive, that you have returned to us. Under normal circumstances, you know that I would never question your judgment. You are the man that I trust my army to, the man who's advice I seek out when I'm unsure of myself, but to rush to such a hasty decision?\" Almost impatiently, Tristan demanded, \"I ask of you to speak plainly. Tell me what it is that is on your mind so that I can put your worries to rest.\" \"Rhiannon is beautiful. I don't think there is a man at Castle D'Or who would deny her that. And she saved your life, two things that are a great attraction for any man, but how much do you know about her? Is she worthy of you? Can she be trusted? Are you really in love, or are you simply offering her a better life out of gratitude?\" While Isolde's heart took offense at Marke's words, her brain knew that the leader was justified and right in asking such questions of her betrothed. Perhaps it was because of the circumstances surrounding how they met and how they fell in love, but she started to wonder, after listening to his King, if Tristan would regret his hasty decision in asking her to return to his home with him. While she had no doubt of her own feelings – she loved him for the way he listened to her without judgment, without scorn or derision, without censure unlike anyone else in her sheltered world, for forcing her to confront her feelings for him instead of hiding behind the emotional walls foisted upon her as a woman and as a future queen, for asking her how she felt when they were together for the first time instead of ignoring her and focusing upon his own needs, for making her the bracelet she had yet to take off not as a means to thank her but simply to show that he cared – what were his? They had never spoken of their emotions, instead choosing to act upon them. Though she had no doubt that Tristan genuinely felt for her, were her feelings stronger than his? When she heard his response, though, beyond the guilt of her momentary doubt, there was only a proud, bright burst of affection within her towards the man she loved. Its sheer vitality warmed her body that had suddenly become chilled without Tristan's pressed against her as it had been while they rode through the untamed wilderness to Castle D'Or. \"Marke, Rhiannon didn't simply give me a place to rest and offer me medicine. She spent every moment that she could with me – reading to me, talking to me. I have shared more of myself with her in the few short weeks of our acquaintance than I could ever share with anyone else given an entire lifetime. Frankly, it is I who is unsure whether or not I am worthy of her. Whereas she is beautiful and kind, generous beyond compare, and intelligent, I am nothing more than a man haunted by his past, a warrior whose sole purpose his entire life has been revenge and retribution. \"As for providing her with a better life, again, I have my doubts. I took her from her home, from everything she knew of life and her family, from peace and brought her here with me, to a place that is known and far from sheltered from our enemies' wrath. In loving me, by marrying me, she'll be risking everything; she'll be risking her heart, knowing that every dawn that we see together could very well be our last. I am not a man destined to live a long life, yet, still, she chose me anyway. If that is not a woman who can be trusted, then I no longer possess the tools necessary to judge character.\" Taking Marke's stunned silence as her cue to step forward, Isolde curtsied deeply before addressing the man who tentatively was holding the warring tribes of Britain together. \"M'lord,\" she greeted him respectfully, gracefully, keeping her gaze downcast and subservient the entire time. \"I do not come to you as another burden upon your land, upon your people. I was able to heal Tristan because of my knowledge of herbs, of elixirs, and I offer my skills and knowledge to your kingdom as well. All I ask in return is your blessing. Though I am poor and possess no royal lineage, am of no importance to Britain like Tristan, I love him.\" She stopped there, unable to say more due to her nerves. Although they had worked on cloaking her Irish lilt, Isolde feared that the more she talked the more her natural way of speaking would reveal itself. But, more than that, she simply couldn't utter another word as anxious as she was that even after their heartfelt pleas and declarations, their union would be denied. If Marke spoke out against their marriage, she had no idea what they would do. Though, now that she had left Ireland, she knew that she couldn't go back to the life her father was intent upon forcing her into, she knew that she also couldn't ask Tristan to leave his life behind for her. No, she respected his duty and his honor, his love for his country and his people too much, even if she knew his duty, honor, and love towards her were stronger. How could she ask the man she loved to compromise the very things about himself that made her cherish him in the first place? \"Then you shall marry in a month's time,\" Marke announced, causing a celebratory roar to spread throughout the gathered people. Over the din of their excited murmuring, he continued, \"that should give the other barons enough time to travel to Castle D'Or in order to join us at your wedding and for you women to fuss about the way you do in preparation for such events. In the meantime, Rhiannon....\" Startling her, the King bowed and gently lifted and kissed her right hand. \"Welcome to my home, and thank you for saving Tristan's life.\" For several minutes after everyone filtered away, going back to whatever tasks it were that had been occupying them before she and Tristan rode into town, Isolde just stood in her same place, amazed at how easily, how graciously she had been accepted. Ever so slowly, a small, tentative, slightly crooked smile worked its way unto her lips, curling their corners in astonishment. But then Tristan was there, grinning widely and taking her into his arms, spinning her around in such obvious delight that his elation became contagious, and soon she was beaming just as broadly. Hand in hand, as they walked towards the castle together, Isolde felt as though, for the first time in years, perhaps her entire life, she could finally breathe. Isolde had made a beautiful bride, but, for Tristan, she made an even more beautiful wife. As promised the day they had arrived together upon his return to Castle D'Or a month prior, they had been married, given a King and Queen's service to be exact. Though he had been puzzled as to why Marke insisted upon such a lavish affair, by the time he saw Isolde floating towards him across the river, the flicker of hundreds of flames illuminating her golden hair and creamy skin, making her glow, impossibly fair, against the velvet, ebony backdrop of a still, quiet night, the last thing on his mind had been questioning... well, anything. Instead, all his focused had been upon his vows, upon Isolde's vows, upon kissing her for the very first time as her husband. Now, though, as he sat with Marke and all the other barons and important figures of Britain, missing his own wedding reception and wanting nothing more than to leave and go somewhere private with Isolde, he knew why such care and excess had been placed upon his nuptials. Buoyed by his return, as if it were a blessed omen, the other men had pledged to stand behind Marke, making him King of Britain just as they had been fighting for years to achieve, just as his father had fervently proposed and wanted that fateful night nine years prior when his life had been taken from him far too early. However, the other barons had one condition for Marke to meet before they would agree to sign any treaty. He, Tristan, was to be Marke's second, literally Britain's Prince, her King in waiting. Though unification was everything he had lived for up until the moment he thought his life had been taken from him and he had in effect met Isolde, the new price being asked of him seemed almost too much. While he understood that the barons saw Marke's success intricately intwined with Tristan's, he knew that conclusion to be in error. In order for Marke to lead the country effectively, Tristan's presence at his side was not necessary. Although he would continue to stand behind Britain and fight for her, he wanted no part in ruling the fledgling nation, and he certainly didn't want to be the next man in line for the throne. Not only did Tristan feel as though he were not qualified for the job, but he had no desire to rule, no skill at giving speeches or taking care of others. His mind was a military one. Whereas he could plan for battle, he had no idea how to plan during times of peace. He could train men to fight, but he knew nothing of planting and harvesting crops. However, he also knew that such talents could be learned, certainly not perfected but learned to the point of success. No, beyond his disinterest in such a vital role, the true reason as to why he was so against being Marke's second was the risk that it placed upon Isolde. As Prince of Britain, she would be Princess, placing her in harm of being discovered. At the same time, though, if he didn't accept the barons' demands, the pact would disintegrate and fall apart before it even had a chance to be officially formed, and suspicions would still be cast upon them, because, instead of thrusting Isolde into unwanted attention, everyone would be questioning why he suddenly refused his duty to his country and people. In essence, he was damned either way. So, in choosing what he believed to be the lesser of two evils, Tristan merely nodded his assent. The sooner the treaty was completed, the sooner that he could return to Isolde, and they could begin preparing together for what his new role would mean to them together as a couple. However, as he sat there to Marke's left, observing each and every man as he approached the table to sign the treaty, he noticed too things: Lord Wictred was furious, attempting to hide his rage but furious nonetheless, and Melot was hurt, a shadow of betrayal haunting his previously friendly eyes. Together, anger and bitterness were a dangerous combination. Placing his own signature on the vellum, Tristan fervently hoped that he had made the right decision... for everyone's sake. \"Do you miss Ireland?\" They were lounging together under the broken canopy of the Roman Ruins, sunlight filtering in to dapple their bare, exposed flesh. Although there was a light breeze that afternoon, both the warmth of the day and the warmth of their bodies entwined together kept her from feeling the chill. Her form lax with recently experienced pleasure, Isolde had been near sleep before Tristan spoke, his unexpected question returning her to the precious moment they were sharing away from everything and everyone else. Though she was aware of the fact that others knew of the ruins, she couldn't help but feel as though they belonged to them, their private oasis. \"There are things that I miss about Ireland – visiting my mother's ashes, Bragnae, the wide open spaces,\" she answered, further molding her back to her husband's chest and watching as her fingers danced along the arm he had carelessly thrown over her naked stomach. He was leaning against a crumbling wall, and she was leaning against him. \"But, no, I don't miss Ireland itself. Actually, I find that I quite like it here.\" The rumble of his laughter transferred and pulsed through her body. \"You sound surprised by that.\" \"Well, it's new, completely different than the life I'd lived up until I left with you. I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew that I wanted to be with you, that I'd be happy with you, but I didn't know if I'd be happy with your people, and I am. Though I'm the Princess again, I'm not treated that differently than any other woman in the village. People talk to me; I'm not deferentially shunned. Not only am I respected because I'm your wife, but I am respected for who I am, too. After years of being ignored, pushed aside, you have no idea how much that means to me.\" \"I'm glad,\" Tristan said, kissing her crown softly before speaking once more. \"However, I'm still unsure about being Marke's second, about the risk that it brings to us, to you.\" \"I don't see what other decision you could have made,\" Isolde told him honestly. Before he could protest, she continued, \"by declining their offer, you not only would have raised their suspicions, but you also would have alienated your strongest allies. We went over this the night of our wedding, the night that the treaty was signed, and we can continue to go over it as often as you like until the coronation, but my mind will not be swayed. You did the right thing, I believe in you, and, perhaps more importantly, I believe in us. I know that I was unsure when you first suggested that I leave Ireland with you, but, now, after coming here with you, after marrying you, I know that I made the right decision. We'll make this work. I just know that we will.\" He turned her over then, rolling both of their forms until she was flat on her back and he had settled once more over top of her. Though his face was pensive, still worried, she could see a spark of hope dancing in his dark eyes, and she smiled in return. Leaning forward, she kissed him softly, beckoning his lips closer to hers with the tender embrace as she fell backward once more, Tristan following. \"I love you,\" she whispered. \"And I love you, Isolde,\" her husband returned genuinely, instinctively. Only when they were alone in the Roman Ruins did he allow himself to call her by her given name, and she cherished those stolen, secret admissions. Briefly, for only just a moment, she thought that she saw a darting shadow out of the corner of her eye, but then Tristan was kissing her once more, and his body was fused intimately with hers, and everything and anything other than their own elemental, profound movements disappeared. Such flights of fancy were just that. No one else was there with them; they were alone, and her husband's attentions returned her to reality but only momentarily before the passion between them engulfed her completely, and she was lost in the bliss and ecstasy that was Tristan's touch. When he was near her, inside of her, completing her, nothing else existed. Bursting through the castle doors, Melot strode into Wictred's home without waiting for an invitation or a proper announcement. After riding without stopping, simple courtly courtesies were not going to prevent him from sharing the news of the deception he had uncovered, stolen a glance of during a private, personal moment between a man and his wife. Though if such treachery had been visited upon him he would have been violent with indignation and rage, he saw no fault in his actions, believing them to be just and true, for they had discovered a traitor by using the secret trap door which led into Castle D'Or's keep in order to trail Tristan and his perfidious imposter of a wife. \"It's all a lie,\" he announced bitterly, fervently upon his entrance. Without reacting, Wictred questioned, \"what,\" while signaling for everyone but the two of them to exit the room. Once they were alone, Melot expounded, \"Tristan's return, his marriage, his wife. They lied about everything.\" A hardness entered the older man's gaze, but, still, he did not rise from his chair, and, still, he did not react outwardly. \"I don't know what you're talking about Melot, but hardly everything you're referring to is an elaborate deception. I've seen Tristan alive with my own eyes, and I've witnessed him with Rhiannon. He loves his wife.\" \"While that may be true, she is not a Briton, her father is not dead, and her mother did not raise her. Yes, she rescued him, saved his life, and they fell in love, but that is as far as their truths go. Who she is, even her name, it is all treachery of the most treasonous kind.\" \"Go on,\" Lord Wictred urged, raising slightly to lean against the table. Seeing that his audience was indeed interested in what he had to say, Melot revealed, \"she is from Ireland, is of noble birth, and is not unfamiliar with the title of Princess.\" \"Isolde,\" the contentious baron breathed out, exultation and anticipation generously coloring his tone. Even louder, he yelled while pounding the table with his fists, \"her name is Isolde.\" \"King Donnchadh's only child and heir.\" Sitting once more with a smirk upon his face, Wictred took a generous gulp from his goblet of wine before motioning for Melot to join him. As he sat down, the older man asked, \"and what do you propose that we do with this information?\" \"Why, we expose them,\" Melot replied immediately. \"We go to the court, we tell Marke, and we confront them with the truth of her identity. They'll both be exposed as traitors, and Marke and the other barons, yourself included, will have no choice but to demand retribution. Tristan will be stripped of his title, perhaps banished or even sentenced to death, and...\" \"And you'll be right there to step in and take over for him, right?\" \"After I have gathered this information, have I not proven myself worthy of such a position?\" Holding up his hands in surrender, Lord Wictred said, \"you misunderstand me, Melot. I was not questioning your fitness to be Prince; I was questioning Marke's to be King. Tristan has always been his favorite. He has depended upon him for advice for too many years. If he was so determined to give his trust to a traitor, how can we trust him?\" \"And what do you suggest instead?\" \"I think that we should wait, that we should confront Tristan and Marke on the night of their coronation and impress upon the other barons that, if Britain is going to survive as a unified nation, she is going to need a far-seeing, brave, fearless leader, a man like yourself. Now, as for whom you should name as your second, while I would not refuse the offer, I cannot tell you who to pick. However, need I remind you that, when you learned of this information, it was I that you trusted with it. In the meantime,\" Wictred continued, \"I shall go to Ireland with your discovery and inform King Donnchadh exactly what has happened to his missing daughter. If the other barons won't stand behind you with just the risk of Marke as their leader hanging over their heads, perhaps the threat of war from an enraged, powerful father will further convince them.\" \"And you think that Donnchadh can be trusted, that he will side with us and then leave with his daughter without making further demands of his support?\" Smiling cruelly, the older man responded, \"I think such support would only be fair and right after we return his poor, kidnapped, used daughter to him, don't you?\" Grinning in return, Melot simply nodding in agreement before raising his own cup of wine in a toast. \"To the destruction of Tristan!\" \"And to the reign of King Melot, soon-to-be ruler of all of Britain,\" Wictred finished. He really liked the sound of that. The ceremony that would officially declare Lord Marke of Cornwall King of Britain and he, Tristan of Aragon, Prince was almost complete when the doors of the castle were forced open, emitting the very last person Tristan had ever wanted to lay eyes upon: Ireland's King Donnchadh, Isolde's father. Without thought, he immediately reached for his sword, removing it as he lunged in front of his wife, shielding her from both harm and sight as much as he could with his own form. Beside him, Marke stood in shock, in bewilderment, but Tristan knew exactly what had happened. Someone had betrayed them, had discovered the truth and used it to their own advantage. He wasn't surprised to see Wictred slither around the room in order to come to a stop near the Irish King, but he was flabbergasted to watch Melot do the same thing. As he witnessed his boyhood friend, the man who had fought beside him since he was a child, the closest thing that he had to a brother leave his own side to go and stand against him with his enemy, Tristan understood that a coup had taken place. How or even why, in that moment, no longer mattered; with everything about to be ruined, all he cared about was making sure that Isolde escaped safely with her life. Everything else – Marke, the kingdom, his own life – had to become secondary, and they did. \"Isolde, daughter, it is alright now,\" Donnchadh spoke tenderly, but Tristan could easily see past the ruse. \"I have come for you, and you'll be going back home to Ireland with me this night, your abduction avenged, your abductor slain for the wrongs he visited upon you.\" No one moved; no one said a word. Finally, it was Marke who stepped forward. \"What is this commotion about,\" he demanded to know. \"The woman that you speak to is Rhiannon, beloved wife of my second, Prince Tristan of Britain. There is no Isolde here.\" \"Are you certain, Lord Marke?\" The title was an obvious insult, for the Irish King was evidently refusing to acknowledge the new leader of their united nation. \"Of course. If Tristan says her name is Rhiannon, then her name is Rhiannon. I trust him implicitly.\" Snickers sounded from the line of Irish across the room, Wictred and Melot smirking cruelly. \"Then you are not only a man of weak judgment,\" Donnchadh said, \"but also a fool. Why would I come here, storm your castle if there was even a chance I was wrong? Your men have bested me before, and we are still recovering from the last time we battled you. No, I come here not as a King but as a father wanting to rescue his daughter.\" Hardening his voice, he commanded, \"Isolde, now. Come to me, daughter.\" When she still didn't move, when Tristan still remained poised before her, ready to fight, and when Marke still refused to see the truth, Melot stepped forward. \"It is true, Uncle. I discovered their lies myself. I have been suspicious for quite some time of the story they told upon returning to Castle D'Or, and, as everyone in the town knows, they often sneak away to the Roman Ruins to be together. A few weeks ago, I followed them and, in the process, overheard them speak of Ireland, of their deception; I overheard Tristan refer to his wife as Isolde, not Rhiannon.\" Needing reassurance that his trust was warranted, Marke turned to him and asked, \"is this true, Tristan? Please, tell me that it is not. Tell me that my nephew is merely being jealous and petty, that you have not deceived me.\" He remained quiet. Looking his King, the man who had saved his life and raised him like a son, in the eye, Tristan said not a word. However, the same could not be said for his wife. Struggling against him and failing to push past him, she remarked loudly enough for the entire room to hear, \"it is the truth that I rescued and saved Tristan's life, that we fell in love while he was recuperating, and that I am his wife, loyal to both him and this kingdom.\" \"But your name,\" Marke roared. Bowing her head, she answered, \"Isolde,\" her voice a mere whisper, but everyone in the room heard anyway and gasped at her acknowledgement. Regaining her fire, his wife raised her crown and yelled, \"my name is Princess Isolde, wife of Tristan of Aragon, Prince of Britain. Whoever I was in the past, that no longer matters. I have no father in this room.\" \"While you might feel that way, and I believe that you do, it does not matter. You lied, Tristan lied, and I cannot ignore or forget such trespasses. I'm sorry, but these decisions were yours. Now, you must live them with.\" Turning to his guards, Marke declared, \"seize him,\" nodding in Tristan's direction. When the soldiers approached, he did not fight his capture, though he did press Isolde further back away from the crowd and her father. However, his efforts were pointless, for, as soon as the men started to lead him away, Donnchadh closed ranks, harshly pulling his daughter, Tristan's wife, away by her arm, mercilessly leading her towards the still open doorway and back towards a life of duty and honor for a man who did not possess those qualities himself. \"No,\" he screamed, pointlessly lunging in his wife's direction. When his efforts were to no avail, he turned pleading eyes upon the man who had once saved his life. \"While I know I don't deserve your loyalty or your sympathy after what I've done, she does,\" Tristan begged. \"Do not let him take her back to Ireland; do not sentence her to a loveless life. Kill me if you have to, make an example of me, for I do not care, but, please, Marke, protect Isolde!\" In return she cried out as well. Instead of begging for her own life, though, instead of seeking solace and quarter from the only man possibly powerful enough to stand up against her father, Isolde pleaded for his life, sobbing and stretching out her hand towards his rapidly disappearing figure until he could no longer see her, her tears and sorrow becoming that much more desperate, that much more miserable the further they were separated. With his last glimpse of the room full of Britain's most influential men, Tristan saw a hint of feeling in his King's gaze, but he knew that for anything that Marke decided to do, even if it was in an effort to aid Tristan and Isolde, it was too late, for all the other barons had backed away from the Lord of Cornwall, aligning themselves with the traitorous Melot and Wictred, with the capitalizing Donnchadh. The treaty was broken, Marke was now alone, and he and Isolde were now without hope. Everything he cared for, everything he loved had been destroyed. The sounds of battle raged around him, but he was powerless, unable to help chained in Castle D'Or's dungeon. Tristan didn't need to be outside to know what had happened. With the barons turning against Marke, Melot, Wictred, and Donnchadh had seized the opportunity and used it to their advantage, storming the castle in the hopes of defeating the powerful Lord of Cornwall. Even stripped of his title of King, Marke was still the most influential of all the barons. If they could defeat him, then they could stand together under a new Lord of Cornwall – Melot. What the barons didn't see, though, was that Melot was simply a puppet. He was controlled by Wictred, and Wictred was nothing more than the Irish King's lap servant. By turning against Marke and supporting his treacherous nephew, they were handing all of Britain over to Ireland on a silver platter. Startling him out of his dark thoughts, Tristan heard the sounds of the dungeon door behind him opening. Scooting up so that he was sitting as straight as he possibly could with the irons banding his hands and feet together, he was stunned to see Marke walk into his cell, followed by a single guard. \"Release him,\" the older man commanded, leaving Tristan speechless. Neither was he capable of questioning the Lord's generosity nor of expressing to him his gratitude. Once the guard did as he was told and left the stone chamber, Marke spoke softly, explaining himself. \"Though I cannot condone your actions, your deceptions, I can understand them. While you might have betrayed me and my trust, you are not a traitor to your country. Go. Leave Castle D'Or now while you have a chance, and do not come back. With the fighting, the Irish are thoroughly distracted. I believe that you shall have no issue locating and then releasing your wife. There is a boat down at the river waiting for you. When Marke turned on his heel to leave, Tristan called out, \"thank you,\" as sincerely as he could. The words were rather empty, meaningless in comparison to the gift he had been given, but they were all he could think of to say. However, Marke simply kept walking, never once acknowledging his recognition. Tristan couldn't blame him. He had left her. After everything they had been through together and on the verge of escaping with their lives and their love intact despite the astounding odds set against them, Tristan had stupidly, selflessly left her to return to the fight. If his noble actions didn't make her love him just that much more, then she would have hated him for throwing away what could very well turn out to be their last chance to be together. She had been overjoyed and shocked beyond words when he first found her, setting both she and an equally secured Bragnae free from the ropes that restrained them in the Irish camp while her father and his men were off slaughtering the Britons. Quickly and as quietly as she could possibly move, she had followed him to the river where he led them to a waiting boat, climbing in without doubt or reservation. But then he had kissed her, pushed the boat away, and ran off into the mists and wild screams of the night, disappearing before she could even realize what he was doing or offer a single protest. Several tense, nerve-wracking moments later, she spoke, more so to herself than to the maid whom she had just been reunited with. \"He'll survive this battle, just like he survived the last, and, when it's over, he'll come for us, and he'll find us, and we'll go somewhere else, somewhere where none of us are known and we can live a life of peace, of honor and love away from my father's influence and the constant feuding of Britain's barons.\" \"I pray for all our sakes that what you say will come true,\" Bragnae whispered, obviously cowered by fear into using such soft, hard to hear tones. Despite the fact that the swiftly flowing river was ever moving them further and further away from the castle and the battle that surrounded it, they could still hear the deafening strains of fighting. \"But I fear that such an outcome is nearly impossible.\" Turning to face her maid, Isolde grabbed her hands roughly and demanded, \"what do you mean? Tristan is smart, and strong, and he has managed to live through so much already. Surely he'll...\" \"The odds have never quite been so stacked against him before,\" Bragnae confessed. In wide eyed horror, she listened as the older woman continued. \"Your father has planned this perfectly, Isolde. Lord Cornwall's nephew and Lord Wictred plot to seize control of the kingdom, and they exposed Lord Marke and your Tristan in order to convince the other barons to side with them. And that's not the worst of it. There's a secret trap door that leads from something the nephew refers to as the Roman Ruins right into the lowest level of the castle's keep. They are going to use this to sneak inside of the castle's walls, surrounding Lord Marke, his men, and, if he succeeds in getting back inside, your Tristan. There's no way they'll be able to win, let alone even escape.\" Isolde wanted to deny Bragnae's words, but they made too much sense. She knew of the trap door; Tristan had showed her its location in case she was ever in danger and needed to flee the castle. It must have been how Melot spied on them at the ruins, how their secrets had been exposed. Such a simple, innocent, seemingly almost childlike treasure of fancy had been the very thing to destroy her freedom, and, now, the same thing was threatening to not only ruin an entire country but take her beloved husband from her. Standing, she declared, \"I can't allow this to happen. I won't.\" \"I understand your desperation, but just what exactly do you think you'll be able to do to stop it?\" \"I can fight,\" she told Bragnae, standing in the narrow, tiny boat. \"And I can make sure they win.\" With that, without waiting for a response, she reached for the oars and, with all her might, started steering the boat back to shore. She had a plan. He was injured, perhaps mortally so, Marke as well, but, still, Tristan refused to show weakness as he stepped onto the open drawbridge, Lord Wictred's severed head held high in the air for all to see. Melot had already been slain by the coward he took sides with against his uncle. \"Behold! The head of a traitor!\" From far below, the next words spoken, the next voice to speak made him freeze. \"And behold the body of a man who does even deserve such a name, for he is less than a traitor, lower than a dog.\" To punctuate her words, Tristan watched as his beautiful, gentle, supposed to be long gone down the river and safe wife picked up the heavy sword she dragged behind her and cleanly sliced off her father's head, its heavy weight landing against the wood below his feet before his body followed suit and tumbled after it. Still wielding her sword, Isolde yelled with conviction, \"my father had no honor, no sense of duty to his people. He ruled for himself. He conquered for himself. He pillaged, and raped, and destroyed your lands all for himself. And you,\" she chastised the other barons, spitting out her words with evident disdain. \"You turned against a man who had the compassion to release my husband, not because he wasn't hurt by our dishonesty but because he recognized that a King cannot play god with his subjects lives. You turned against a man who welcomed a stranger into his kingdom, who raised his friend's son as his own, who lifted himself above personal adversity and humiliation to rule even more ably than any other man possibly could. And for what, to fight alongside an animal and two cowards? Kill me now where I stand if you must, but, before you do, ask yourselves this question: do you act with your people's best interest in mind, or are you blinded by your jealousies, your pride, your own inflated egos? Britain deserves to be united; it deserves the Lord of Cornwall as its King.\" Whether or not his brave, insightful wife had anything else to say in that moment, he'd never know, because, before she had a chance to even take a breath after her impressive, effective speech, Tristan collapsed, his weakened body unable to withstand any further pain or blood loss. As he laid there, prone against the stained wood of the bridge, he could hear the faint din of voices beneath him as barons and soldiers alike put down their weapons, the water of the moat rushed by, and the sound of his own heart pounded loudly in his ears. However, above the cacophony of other noises, he also heard Isolde scream his name, her voice choked with pain, desperation, and disbelief. The last thing he saw before his eyes fell closed was her tear stained, dirt smudged faced. Nothing had ever been or could ever be as beautiful. And the last thing he heard was her fearful order to carry him to the Roman Ruins where she kept her herbs and prepared her elixers, the sound of her voice a pleasant balm against the numbing pain he was experiencing. It wasn't the goodbye she deserved, but it was enough that he could drift away and die in peace. Perhaps the most clear memory of her childhood was her mother's memorial, and here Isolde was, saying goodbye to another person she loved far, far too early. They didn't deserve the death they had been given, the unjust conclusion to a life barely led, but she had been powerless to prevent their injury, and her elixirs had done nothing to alleviate their pain or rectify the damage done to them. As she watched their boat drift out to see, a single, lingering tear slid down her pale, cold cheeks. Bragnae was at her side. Instead of fleeing down the river in the boat that Isolde herself had refused to escape in, her maid had rushed to her aid and assistance, following her to the Roman Ruins after the rather anti-climatic conclusion to the battle that never really started. Yet, at the same time, what fighting did occur had been eventful enough to turn her life upside down and replace it with an existence she didn't recognize, an existence she didn't want. She was now Queen of both Ireland and Britain, two titles she neither wanted nor felt that she deserved. All she desired was a life of beauty and love, of peace and tranquility, of duty and honor far from the deadly, intrusive corruption and influence of politics. And it would be hers. After everything she had sacrificed and lost, for the second time in her life, Isolde was going to act without thought to consequence; she was going to selfishly do what she felt was best for her and no one else. Because of recent happenings, no one had thought it strange or even unwise that she immediately name a successor in the event that something should happen to her. It was one thing to leave a single nation in such a limbo should she suddenly be taken by illness or murdered, but to leave two countries in such a plight, especially two who had been enemies for so long and one whose unity was so unstable, was simply foolish. So, with the proper conditions in place, Isolde planned to leave Castle D'Or under the cloak of darkness that night. And she was never going to return. As the three of them walked along the beach or, more accurately, the two of them walked along the beach, her daughter being carried, Isolde turned to her companion and asked, \"do you regret what I did, the decisions I made for us?\" \"No,\" her husband answered, using his free arm which was not holding their infant daughter to pull her closer against his side. \"We're both alive, our child is safe, and I'm happy. Aren't you?\" \"More so than I ever thought possible,\" Isolde replied on a whispered confession. \"But what if Britain needs you again someday? What if your dream for her starts to fall apart?\" \"Then I will return to fight,\" he answered, and she didn't begrudge him the response. Rather, she appreciated his honesty and admired his loyalty, just as she always had when it came to his duty towards his people and country. \"After all,\" he added, pausing their movement, smiling in her direction, and kissing her softly. With eyes alight with merriment, Tristan finished, \"it wouldn't be the first time I returned from the dead.\" ","Summary":" A/N: I stumbled upon the legend of Tristan and Isolde almost by accident.

So, to make up for that, I decided to write in a new female lead. I know that some events are not exactly the same as in the movie, but I had to tweak the events to fit the story. ENJOY! (: R&R; please and thank you! Disclaimer: The only thing I own is Lilith. Other than that, I own nothing. \" Run Lilith! Run as far and as fast you can before they find you!\" Those were the last words Lilith could remember before fleeing the British Isles. She remembered the screaming that echoed within her village, the smell of burning homes, and the stench of every Irish warrior there to take women and children back to Ireland to be made into slaves. Lilith never ran far enough and the Irish found her hiding underneath tree roots when she was only 9 years old. When she arrived with the loads of women and children all she could do was stare at her surroundings. She knew that this was going to be her new home, the place where she would live and die. It was her fate and she accepted it. \"Who is this Father?\" Lilith remembered that day clearly; the day she was chosen to be a ladies maid to King Donnchadh's daughter. Those were happier times Lilith reminisced, not for her but for Princess Isolde and the King, for the Queen was alive then. \"Isolde,\" the Queen placed a gentle hand on her daughters should her and brushed away her soft golden locks. \"Lilith is here to be your maid, to do whatever it is that you wish. Do you understand?\" \"Yes mother.\" Whatever it is that you wish . Lilith knew what that meant. Unless she wanted to die, she was under the control of this young girl's every whim, no matter how ridiculous. It was settled then, Lilith was to live within the walls of the Irish castle and follow Princess Isolde where ever she went. Lilith was happy about one thing, she was allowed time for herself every night after the princess had been put to bed. Lilith loved this time of the night. She would disappear into the dead of night and find herself staring at the ocean before her. During the day, while she trod behind Isolde, she can see Britannia off in the distance. Oh how her heart longed to go home. It was pure chance that she found the small stone hut by the shore. This, this place would be her Britannia. As time passed, Lilith settled into her life as a ladies maid. Isolde became a sister to her, or at least Lilith liked to believe so. Before the Queen died, the two young girls played with one another, with no class division at all. They lived as two young normal girls playing in the wild flower fields or down by the shore. However, after the Queen died, life began to change. King Donnchadh was no longer the kind and gentle rule he had once been. He was consumed with taking Britannia and capturing more slaves. He began ignoring his fatherly duties and ruled all, even his own daughter, as a King. Isolde hated this. She wanted life to go back to the way it was. As Isolde grew, so did her passion in trying to get her father to notice her again, to love her again, and to be what he once was. Lilith knew that this would not happen. King Donnchadh has closed his heart and locked it shut. He already killed most of the slaves with in the castle for no reason at all. Isolde's willfulness often resulted in Lilith's punishments. As a loyal ladies maid, Lilith often took the blame for anything that Isolde did. Her punishments were often lashings by the King or anyone he deemed needed to punish her. Over the course of ten years, Lilith's scars left ridges along her back. She could easily have fought against it and run, but that would have resulted in death. There was no way that she would let the Irish be the death of her. Lilith was now nineteen years old. She rested in the comfort of her own stone hut for a few hours of the night. She tended to her new lashings; the result of being unable to stop Isolde from running away from the castle again. \"Of all the things I do for this girl,\" Lilith whispered to herself and winced at the salted pieces of cloth on her skin. Outside Lilith could hear the wild horses nickering and running along the sand. She put her cream colored dress back on and ventured outside the hut to watch them. Watching them made her long Britannia and her father. She still remembered how to ride a horse, how to hold a bow and how to hunt. She was the eldest of five children and the only survivor of that fateful night. \"Dear wild horses,\" she whispered into the night. \"How I long to be like you.\" ","Summary":" Synopsis: He never loved her; he loved the idea of her.

Love stories were supposed to end in a kiss, a wedding, the birth of a child. Well, thought Isolde sadly, two of them would come to pass. As Tristan took his last breath, she had leaned forward and kissed his motionless lips. She still didn't know why. Perhaps it was so he could take some pleasant memory with him. But before she had even pulled away, he was dead. The wedding would never happen. The child, however...Isolde placed a hand over her belly. There was the slightest of bumps there, completely unnoticeable to everyone but her. She didn't know whose child it was- Tristan's, or Mark's? She would have liked to think the child belonged to Tristan. What if it was a little boy, with dark curly hair and brown eyes? Could she raise him without breaking under the grief of seeing her dead lover in the young face of her child? \"Isolde,\" said a voice, breaking her out of her thoughts. The words belonged to Mark, who looked sorrowfully at her. Evidently Tristan's funeral was over. She looked out to sea and saw the lonely wooden boat floating on the waves. The flames engulfed it in a haze of orange and gold and red. Black smoke billowed into the overcast sky. Soon, the man she loved would be nothing but ashes thrown to the wind and scattered in the water. A black veil covered Isolde's face and draped down to the ground. A heavy silver circlet held it in place. She could feel the chill of the metal through the thin veil. She turned her eyes slowly to Mark's light ones. \"Isolde, I don't expect you to come back with me,\" he said. \"But if there is anything I can do to help you, tell me. I will do it,\" he said. Isolde's heart shuddered inside her. She read the sincerity in his words, and a tear rolled down her face. Mark was a good man. He had been betrayed by his wife and nephew, and still he was gentle and understanding. She couldn't stand it. She turned and fled, unsure of where she was going but desperate to get away. She found herself standing at the entrance to the garden, the place that belonged to her and Tristan. It was nothing but ash. Dark cinders coated everything. The gorgeous murals were gone, the statues cracked and blackened. Tristan had done this, and the thought made her feel both desolate and closer to him. She knelt on the ground and sifted the soft ashes through her fingers. She could almost feel him here, like he was still alive. She could sense his breathing, the soft rise and fall of his chest, see his strong shoulders under his tunic. Most eerily, she thought she sensed his eyes on her. She wished she could see his ghost appear, luminous and beautiful. She could imagine him now. His skin would glow slightly. Everything about him would be just the same, aside from that. He would smile. Tell her she would be fine. But it was just a foolish fantasy, and she cast it out of her mind. All the color seemed to have leeched out of the sky. There was nothing, no speck of blue or red or brilliant gold. Only gray that faded to black. Isolde stood at Tristan's grave. It was just a symbol, really, since his ashes were now far and wide across the water. His spirit, though, would reside here. She was sure of it. Her fingers dug in the soft, wet dirt. She dropped a handful of seeds in a small depression in the ground. Day after day, she came. She sat and watched the trees grow, and at the same time felt the child in her belly grow as well. The branches of the tree wove together and interlocked in a way that seemed utterly natural and eerie at the same time. One evening she picked her way carefully to the grave and the trees. Everything felt heavy today, from her thick crown of braids to her huge belly. Her shoulders slumped forward, drawn down to the earth by some invisible burden she could not bear. She stood and stared at the saplings that would one day be strong, broad trees. She cradled her stomach. \"Time to go,\" she whispered. She smiled slightly, then walked past the grave. A path led through the woods, past valleys and down to a beach. Isolde walked. Her feet guided her while her mind meandered through the memories of better times. When she finally reached the shores of England, she looked out at the waves that rocked and crashed against the sand, as though trying to coax the land right in. The smell of salt pressed over her mouth and nose like a damp cloth. She walked along the shore, the frigid water swirling around her ankles. Heavy drops of rain began to fall. Isolde did not stop or take shelter. She let her feet carry her forward, fading into the distance until she had disappeared entirely, leaving only the sound of crashing waves behind her.

She hesitated. In an instant, images of a life with Tristan, of a home in Britain, of a happy marriage flooded her mind. She looked at Tristan again, his dark eyes pleading her to say yes. \"Come with me,\" he said over the sound of the crashing waves. After Isolde hesitated again, he ventured, \"You said yourself that your parents were dead. What do you want to stay for? A marriage to a man you don't love?\" \"Tristan-\" \"-Bragnae,\" he interrupted her. \"Please come with me,\" he pleaded again in a barely audible whisper. \"Please,\" he repeated, as a wave crashed against them. Why not? There was nothing that she had to stay for and to look forward to. But she was the King's daughter. He would never rest until she was found. Who knew what he would do then. When she hesitated to answer, Tristan whispered, \"I love you.\" Isolde's breath caught in her throat. At the sound of those three words, her resolve melted and all her worries of what her father would do when he discovered that she had run away with the handsome enemy warrior faded away. She looked deep into Tristan's eyes and said, \"Alright. I'll go with you.\" \"You will?\" Tristan smiled, barely able to contain his happiness. \"Yes,\" she laughed. She loved to see him smile. He seemed to rarely smile. To know that she was the cause of his happiness warmed her heart. Another wave crashed against them. \"Come. We must hurry,\" Tristan said helping her into the boat. Isolde watched Tristan effortlessly hop into the boat, put the oars in place, and begin to row away towards Britain. Even though he had not fully recovered from the illness that the poison brought on, he still seemed so strong and handsome. She looked out over the water again towards Britain and then looked back at Tristan. What did the future hold? Isolde looked back at Ireland, back at the beach they had just left. She would miss Ireland. But the future looked too bright to look back at Ireland for long. Once they got out onto the open water and Tristan put the sail up, Isolde said, \"Tristan, there's something I need to tell you.\" Tristan turned towards her and smiled. \"What is it?\" Isolde hesitated, then said, \"My name isn't Bragnae. I lied. It's Isolde.\" Tristan moved closer to her. \"Isolde?\" He brushed a strand of blonde hair back behind her ear. \"Why did you tell me you name was Bragnae?\" he asked, confused. \"I-I guess I was afraid,\" she said looking down at her hands in her lap. \"Afraid?\" Tristan queried. \"You see,\" she hesitated, \"I'm the daughter of King Donnchadh.\" She gingerly looked up to meet Tristan's shocked and confused gaze. \"But you said both you parents were-\" \"-I know,\" she interrupted. \"I lied.\" She bit her lip, nervous at what his reaction might be. When he didn't respond, she said, \"You don't hate me, do you?\" She searched his face for an answer. Tristan's faced relaxed and he smiled. \"No. I don't hate you. I would have asked you to come anyway, even if I had known.\" Isolde relaxed, and smiled wholeheartedly back. But she couldn't keep herself from saying, \"But when my father finds out, he'll find us. I-It could start a war.\" \"Donnchadh is always looking to start a war against us. He wants to enslave us. Rule over us. It would just be the excuse that he was looking for,\" Tristan consoled her. \"But, Tristan-\" He silenced her, putting a finger to her lips. Then, he bent towards her and lightly brushed his lips against hers. / Isolde had always figured that Tristan was an English warrior of some sort, and perhaps a very good one. But nothing prepared her for the reception that Tristan received when they entered Cornwall. When they had gotten to the English coast, Tristan had borrowed a horse, promising to return it. They had ridden hard to get to Cornwall as quickly as possible. Isolde could tell that Tristan couldn't wait to be home again. \"We're here,\" Tristan said. The horse stepped onto a stone bridge and crossed over it, its hoofs clicking on the stone. As soon as the village came into sight, Tristan stopped the horse for a moment and took in the scene that lay before him. It was good to be home again!

I make no apologies for the fact that my ball is fairly and squarely in the court of Lord Marke, as played by the all too gorgeous Rufus Sewell. I understand that not everyone will agree with my point of view, but it's just a piece of fiction!!! The soundtrack is the haunting \"Wedding Cortege\" by Anne Dudley, the music that accompanies the wedding ceremony in the film, when Isolde floats down the river on the enchanting candle-lit boat to marry Marke. Isolde's love for Marke was deep, intense, unshakeable. On their wedding night she had resisted him, believing herself to be in love with another, but he had been patient and gentle, and by morning she was unashamedly his. He had won her with his lips, his tongue, his body and the true goodness of his heart. He fulfilled her in ways she could only have imagined and in the weeks that followed, her passion for him grew. When they walked together in the marketplace, each touch of his hand filled her with an electricity that left her breathless. She longed to be away from the daylight and the crowds and the noise, alone in their bedchamber with him. When he stood behind her on the parapet, his hand touching hers, his body warming hers and his hot breath on her neck, she struggled to stand. Her only thought was how it would feel when he took her that way later that night. And when he did, murmuring her name into the back of her neck, she knew there could be nothing and no one else for her. As her love for him grew, she wanted only to please him as he could please her. She wanted nothing more than to touch him, to be above him, under him, on him. And when she ran her hands over his body, his eyes flashed black with the depth of his love. His lust for her was intoxicating. His love for her would break her heart. ****** Her love for Tristan was different. She had felt passion for him in those lonely days in Ireland, but now she just pitied him. On her wedding night, when she knew no better, she had whispered to him \"I shall pretend it's you\", but in the ensuing weeks, as her passion for Marke grew stronger, her feelings for Tristan faded. She saw him watching, following her as she walked with Marke, she saw his closed off face, wooden, barely able to show any emotion, and her pity grew. She finally agreed to meet with him when Marke & the warriors rode out, because she needed to explain to him how she felt. But her body betrayed her. She couldn't bear to be the cause of his pain and when he came to her, desperate and childish, she comforted him in the only way she knew how. As this pattern continued, her guilt spiralled and she cried herself to sleep in Marke's arms because she wanted it to stop, wanted to stop betraying the man she loved. Tristan's love was clumsy and inarticulate and needy. He was the very antithesis of everything that was Marke. She tried to tell him, but her words failed. All she could say was that Marke was a good man, and she could not hate him. She tried to gently point out to him that they could never have a normal life together, but he was deaf to her words. So on the fateful night of the coronation when he burned the boathouse & called her to the river to tell her the affair had to stop, her heart leapt. This is what she had longed for, for Tristan to see that it could not continue, for him to set her free to be with the man who held her heart. Her eyes filled with tears for she could see Tristan's pain, but inside her heart sang with joy. When Marke and the warriors came upon them in their final embrace, the worlds' of the three lovers came crashing down. Each of them betrayed, each of them broken beyond repair. And when Marke came to her room seeking the truth from her, she could not give it. Could not put him in the position of having to forgive the unforgivable, so she lied, told him only about Tristan, told him her heart had always belonged to Tristan. The broken, desperate look in his eyes filled her with anguish, but she could not tell him the truth for he was the King and they could have no future if he was to keep the respect of his people. He took just a single breath, almost a sob, and left the room. And with that, her world ended. ****** She was with Tristan when he died & was glad that he at least, never knew the truth. He believed in their love & took that belief with him to the grave. Before she disappeared, she planted two willows where he lay, to symbolise the love they had once shared, to remember his life. But after she fled quietly back to Ireland to live out her life in anonymity on the windswept western shore, she planted a single oak to honour the man she truly loved, her one true desire, her Lord Marke.

Tristan fought like a demon from hell! He whirled that blade around as though it was part of his arm! What a fight he put up for Wictred! Haha!\" a burlesque archer thundered, clapping Tristan on the back. The archer greatly enjoyed retelling the tournament and Tristan's great feat in it. Many had gathered around him in the market place to listen to his story while Tristan stood silently by, his mood darkening with the recollection of the tournament that always haunted him. Usually, Tristan enjoyed taking part in bragging about his victories, but this victory was a poison in his veins. Tristan looked around the marketplace. His breath caught in his throat. There was Isolde. With Marc, as always. They were standing in front of a fruit stand; Marc held out something for her to taste, and they laughed together. Tristan couldn't watch anymore. Disgusted, he turned and walked away from the archer and his entranced listeners. Tristan heard him pause, shocked, and he heard someone call his name. But he continued to walk away, and soon the archer continued his oration. Tristan felt enraged and jealous. He should be the one holding Isolde's hand, making her smile, making her laugh. Marc should not be there beside her. He should be. Why didn't she tell me her real name? Why did she lie to me about her name on Ireland? He was so angry. If he had known, he would not have won her for Marc. At the tournament, he had thought that by winning the Irish Princess for Marc, peace would reign between the two countries, freeing him to marry Isolde. But Isolde was the Irish princess. Why had she deceived him? Did she really love him? He knew the answer, though. Every look she cast his way told him that her heart truly belonged to him. But he could never have her heart, for she would never be his wife. She would always be Marc's wife. What a fool I have been. Tristan hated the looks that others gave him. Ever since he had returned from Ireland, they had looked at him with great pity, thinking he had been tortured beyond compare or perhaps even worse. They have no idea, thought Tristan. And truly, they didn't. Tristan knew that he moped and kept to himself, which he knew gave them all the more reason to pity and gossip, but he could not be around them. His heart was broken and he wanted to be alone. No, he wanted to be with her. And she was always there, always at the dinners and parties. It killed him every time he saw her with Marc. Yet she always looked longingly at him, wishing that she was with him and not with Marc. Tristan wanted to make her happy. He wanted to protect her and fulfill all her dreams, but he couldn't. Fate had played a cruel joke on them. Yet, though he was jealous and hated seeing her with him, he did not hate Marc. Next to Isolde, Marc was the person he cared about most. Had he not reach out his hand that day of the Irish raid and lost it, Tristan would be dead. Perhaps being dead would be better than this , he thought, but he regretted it the moment he thought it, for he had enjoyed and cherished the time that he and Isolde had spent together. But he felt hopeless and alone. Love was just a romantic illusion to him before he met Isolde. He never thought that a woman could capture his heart, but Isolde did. He heard someone behind him calling his name, interrupting his thoughts. He turned to see who it was. His blood ran cold. It was Isolde, standing right next to him.

It was for this reason that Daneal had spent all night in the oak groves just beyond the walls of Castle D'Or. She had constructed sacred fires, offered sacrifices of lamb and grain, and knelt before the spirits of the forest, the heavy light of the moon.

With it was passing her energy. She had gone into the wood as soon as the sun's descent had begun to darken the sky, making sure her fire and alter were set in time for the rising of the moon. Having forgone dinner in the precedence of prayer, she was aching with hunger. But the scraping along the inside of her body was outweighed by her fear and apprehension. Damn the tribes for their selfishness. Damn Marke for his persistent will and strong heart. And damn Melot for his noble grace, his stupid pride. \"I didn't meant that.\" She winced in afterthought as soon as the words had coursed through her mind, distracting her from the purity and whole-hearted love she was trying to convince the gods was at the crux of her prayers. Bring them back safely, she begged, for peace and for the people of Cornwall. Keep your shields around them, she pleaded, so that we may share all we have with our brothers, so that the people of Britain may someday have no fear in the form of Ireland or Saxony or even within itself. But hidden under all her good intentions was a yearning that refused to be completely smothered. Most of all, it cried, bring Mellot back alive for my own selfish heart, that he may feel no pain and that I may not live the rest of my days in agony alone. Her footsteps faltered, unable to form a straight line back to the village as her senses swam under the influence of smoke and exhaustion. The light clang of armor being refitted mingled with shouts for water and calls for horses. Dawn was only just spreading its pale light upon the people who had made their lives around Castle D'Or, but already everyone was busy preparing for the journey of Lord Marke's warriors. They would be riding out at nightfall toward a series of valleys in the southeast controlled by Jutes. Word had reached Cornwall that the Angles were raiding the villages there again, refusing to recognize the Jutes as a sovereign tribe within themselves. Most of the Lords of Britain did not care, it was not their problem for it was not at their doorstep. But Marke had always refused to stand back and watch while Britain destroyed itself from the inside out when the real enemy lay beyond the island the tribes all shared. They had unified to drive off the Romans, there was no reason now why they should not unify again against the Irish. Daneal, like the rest of her kinsmen, believed in the cause of her King. But she was also very much aware of its price. Justice demanded blood. Honor was paid for in the dying breaths of husbands and sons and brothers and nephews. Peace was bought with the tears of widows and orphans. Frequently she wondered why safety had to be bargained for with pain and death, why men seemed unable to work out their problems without cutting one another to ribbons. At the end of the day she could only suppose this was how the gods had meant for life to be. You could not attain a perfect, worry-free existence unless you were truly willing to sacrifice everything for the cause. Perhaps if it were not so, man would not appreciate peace during the scarce moments in which he possessed it. Even so, she was convinced that a short, war-ridden existence with Melot would be brighter than a long, tranquil life ripped away from him. Surely there could be no real peace in the wake of love lost. A gentle chorus of 'hello's and 'good morning's washed over her, growing as she neared the castle. As her father was the personal physician of Lord Marke the entire family's quarters were permanently stationed within its walls. For the most part it was a lovely place to live, always busy, always full of people. But there were times when Daneal's age got the better of her and she wished for a more private home to fill and decorate as she pleased. A place that was truly hers and depended on her hands alone to be filled with warmth and food and comfort. It would be far more work than living at the castle, but as a woman tending to a home was her birthright. The only thing she could ever take ownership of and pride in. She liked to think she would have that someday. In her head, she laid down the woven wattle and pieced together the support beams that would come together to form a roundhouse independent of the castle. There would be a central hearth and walls painted with knots and spirals, perhaps even an oak tree over the entrance for balance and strength. She would cook each morning, clean afterward and kiss Melot before he left to aid the King. She would take their clothes down to the river with the other women, laughing as they swapped stories about their husbands. When she came home there would be dinner to tend to and little feet to chase after. Two boys, both born warriors like their father, and a daughter to whom she could pass on the secrets of womanhood. All three would take their dark curls and wide, mischievous smiles from Melot. Their inability to keep an open eye while laughing would be her own fault. At the end of the day they would all fall asleep around the fire, tired but warm and safe. The images floated around her head as they often did when she allowed herself to slip into daydream and before she even realized she was laying on her bed, sleep overcame her. Maids flowed into the room, lighting the hearth and every torch on the walls. She had slept for far longer than intended and most of the day had already slipped away. No doubt the moment she stepped foot into the Great Hall her parents would be scowling with disappointment. They wouldn't take kindly to the excuse of prayer for Melot's safe return. No one in her family was keen on him, though Daneal knew she had no one to blame for that but herself. As little as she wanted to face their chastisement, there was no choice. The sun was beginning its descent in the sky and soon the feast to see the King's men off would commence. She was expected to be there, dressed and smiling as they entered to applause. \"It was not a good day to fall idle, Daneal.\" Eleanor, the eldest of the maidens grumbled as her young charge rose from the bed and began to splash her face with the water they had brought. \"Your mother and father were in a right state when no one could find you all morning. This was the last place they thought to look, with so much needing to be done today.\" \"I know.\" She sighed, a headache already forming in her mind from being woken so abruptly. \"I didn't mean to leave everyone shorthanded, I just needed to rest. I doubt I would have been very useful had I not.\" Nodding in understanding, Eleanor offered only a begrudging, tight-lipped smile. \"Thankfully preparations didn't suffer without you, but you'd best hurry getting ready. The feast starts in little more than an hour.\" Knowing better than to respond, Daneal simply nodded and began undressing. The hall was brightly lit with torches and candles, wreaths hung from every fixture available and the rich scent of roasted boar dominated the air. Sweeping in quietly with a few other ladies of the court, Daneal took her place alongside her parents. Even as she avoided turning towards her family, she could feel the irritation in their eyes burning against her skin. \"Do you have any idea how much time I wasted looking for you today?\" Her mother hissed discretely as more people continued to file in. \"The feast was assembled just fine without me.\" She noted, keeping her voice as low as possible. It was stupid to talk back in such a manor, she knew. But at least the retribution of her actions would have to wait until after the feast. \"How dare you.\" Her mother looked over at the young girl beside her, hardly believing what she was hearing. \"That is not the point. Your insolence cannot continue forever. It won't be tolerated.\" \"Can we not discuss this later? We have been asked here to support the King, not to bicker at his table.\" Daneal pleaded with her mother, standing and clapping beside her as the King himself made his entrance followed by Tristan, Melot and the rest of his company. Catching the eye of Marke's nephew for just a moment, Daneal couldn't help but smile when his own face brightened at the sight of her. \"No wonder he won't marry you.\" Her mother leaned over to murmur, \"You can hardly manage your own duties, you'll never be able to handle an entire household.\" This time there wasn't much to be said back. However, Daneal was a little slower than everyone else to take her seat, so heavy was the shock that came with her mother's words. It already hurt enough that Melot still hadn't proposed and that her family knew him only as \"the scoundrel\" who had \"stolen her honor\" behind their doors. Did her own mother have to rub salt in her wounds? On this of all nights, when Melot might very well be riding to his death? Knowing there was no good response that could be made, Daneal simply kept her mouth shut, smiling at the servants as they brought 'round the wine. Speeches were made, toasts filled the air and soon everyone was very full with warm food and hearty conversation. Having no desire to speak with her mother, Daneal kept to herself, finding entertainment only in trying to get Melot to laugh during speeches by making faces at him. Finally, once everyone had digested a little, the dancing began. These were special dances that progressed from illustrating the stories of battles old to bestowing trust and hope within the warriors who would leave that evening. It was an old tradition and, though she wasn't often one for dancing, Daneal enjoyed it very much. Mostly because she was finally away from the reproachful gaze of her family and under the warm fingertips of the only man she had ever loved. \"Rumor has it you slept all day.\" He teased her the moment their hands were touching, their feet stepping gracefully around one another. Though they made a fairly good pair, it was Melot who really made them look any decent at footwork. He had always been the more graceful of the two. If training to fight for most of his life had instilled anything in him, it was agility. \"Jealous?\" Her playful smirk matched his, but there was an element of honesty there. His skin was pallid, eyes heavy and underlined by grey bags. Either he hadn't slept well the night before, or the stress of preparing for battle was getting to him. Quite possibly both. \"You've no idea.\" He chuckled, \"I don't know how I'm going to stay up all night riding.\" \"Hmm, perhaps we should get you warmed up for the journey?\" It wasn't often that they would risk sneaking away so soon in such a public place. But there wasn't much time before he would ride out and Daneal was desperate to get out from under the ever present gaze of her parents. A fact that was not lost on her lover. \"But then what would your father have to scowl at? I hate to think he might actually have to enjoy himself.\" \"You're riding to war.\" She reminded Melot in a cynically flat tone, standing still as he held her hand above their heads and came around in a circle before taking his place beside her again. \"Trust me, he is enjoying himself.\" \"It isn't really war .\" His voice was soft, eyes pleading with her not to assume the worst. \"My apologies, you're going off to slay fellow countrymen. Which, of course, is much safer.\" \"Stop making it sound simple.\" He chuckled at her antics, \"You know this business of dealing with the barons is not so easy as it appears on the surface.\" \"Melot.\" Her eyes bore into his reproachfully, reminding him not to take her role in this less seriously just because she would be staying at home. \"If anyone knows this isn't easy, it is the women and children Marke's men leave behind tonight.\" \"I know.\" He nodded apologetically, \"I know. I only meant that the politics of it gets lost in the bloodshed. It would be preferable if things were black and white, but they just aren't.\" \"A little grey can be good.\" She shrugged, offering a small smile as her own grey eyes looked up at him. \"You know I love grey.\" The toothy grin she adored so much broke open across his face as the song finally ended and they stood together. As the next one started up and the people around them began to move in intricate circles and turns, he took her hand and led her out of the Great Hall to his own chambers. Though Daneal could usually find shapes in anything, there were none to be found in the firelight as it danced with its own shadows on the ceiling above Melot's bed. Here there was only color and movement and beauty. But it was still captivating. What she loved the most about fire was how no flame was ever the same twice, and so too was the case with its shadows. \"It's getting colder.\" Before now Melot had been quiet as he lay beside her, both of them staring up at the wood beams above. \"I'm not sure I'm going to like sleeping alone after tonight.\" \"You can always sidle up to Tristan.\" Looking over at him, Daneal couldn't help the cheeky smirk that pulled up the side of her mouth. For that she earned a playful shove that was so strong it nearly pushed her clear off the bed, causing a shriek of surprise to fly from her mouth. Narrowing her eyes, she sat up and glared down at the man beside her for a few long, silent moments before smacking him across the face with one of his own pillows. Stunned surprise widened his eyes for just a moment and then they both knew instantly, just from the look on his face, that she wasn't going to get away with that easily. Leaping from the bed, she tore across the room, but he was right behind her before she'd even wrapped his blanket around herself. From one end of the room to the opposite corner, over the mattress, across his trunk he chased her until finally, somewhere between the fireplace and bed, his arms closed around her from behind. Both of them were laughing, though Daneal's lungs were somewhat more labored as she wasn't accustomed to running. Not the way Melot was anyway. \"You should be beaten.\" He chuckled, his voice low in her ear as he leaned down over her shoulder. Her lips met his halfway, curling into a smile as he ran his fingertips across her side, caressing softly. Suddenly, a commotion seemed to arise on the other side of Melot's curtains, which gave way to a view of the front of Castle D'Or. Leaving his lover's side, he crossed the room and stuck his head out to see what all the noise was about. \"OI, YOU LOT!\" He shouted down, laughing softly when he saw that it was only a gaggle of very drunk soldiers. \"Melot!\" A chorus of returns met him happily, if slurred and a bit more amused than necessary. \"What are you doing? I can hear you from up here!\" \"The feast's almost over, in'it?\" They called up, as though Melot had never left the feast at all and this fact was rather obvious. \"We've got to start saddlin' up. Hurry down or you'll be stuck back here pluckin' chickens with the women!\" Shaking his head and chuckling as they stumbled on towards the stables he only nodded, waving them on. \"Alright, alright. Give me a few moments, I'll be along.\" By the time he'd turned around Daneal had worked her way back into the petticoat that had been tossed onto the floor nearly an hour before. She wasn't having much luck finding her dress, but his trousers quickly came into view and she took the opportunity to throw them at his head. However, Melot had not been training to defend his country year after year to be so easily caught off guard. His fingers wrapped around the material easily in mid-air, the smug smile he flashed thereafter her only reward. Rolling her eyes, but smiling in spite of herself, Daneal finally came upon her dress. As she tried to fix it about her form once more, she chanced to voice the question that had been rolling around in her mind for some time. \"How long does Marke anticipate your leave?\" She asked softly, trying to avert her gaze from him as her hands stretched back to do up the laces that held her dress in place. At first there came no response, only Melot's head turning at an odd angle over his shoulder as though he wanted to look at her but couldn't quite bring himself to do it. Slipping his tunic back on, he cleared his throat before answering. \"About a week's ride to Juteland, maybe a fortnight fighting off the Angles and feasting after, then another week back.\" \"If you're lucky.\" \"Or unlucky. The wounded slow us down, but the dead carry no burden.\" \"It does to the families who are left behind. On both sides.\" Her voice was hard with bitterness as she tried to smooth her hair back once again. But it was hard, her hair was long and there were so many knots from rolling around in his bed. Pain and frustration pounded through her with every rake of her fingers through the mess. Just as tears were beginning to sting her eyes, maybe from the ache of her hair being pulled, maybe from the reality of Melot's leave finally beginning to set it, she felt a warm pair of hands encircle her own. They were bigger than hers, stronger, but gentle as they set her hands free and began working through the knots themselves. \"Please do not let your mind linger on such things while I am away.\" He was begging, she could feel it in the soft desperation of his voice. The fire went on burning, crackling and throwing shadows in the silence that followed while his fingers wove in and out her hair. She wasn't sure how a second officer of the King had ever become so good at such a thing, but no one else was as fast and gentle as Melot at untangling the knots that their lovemaking always seemed to bring about. \"Then you want me not to think at all for the next month. How can you ask so much?\" He was the brightest light in her life when at home. How could she stay away from the thought of him when it was all she would have to hold onto at all for the next month. \"Because I love you.\" The murmur fell deeply across her ear as he leaned over her shoulder. Finished with her hair, he came around to face her, eyes heavy with guilt. He made no effort to mask that his leave would be as hard on him as it would be on Daneal. It was for that openness, that respect he showed only her of all the women in D'Or, that she loved him back. \"Melot, it's alright.\" She shook her head, feeling sorry for ever giving him grief when he was just trying to do his duty to the King, his own uncle. \"I should never have\"- \"I have to go in a few moments.\" He stopped her, warm hands coming up to hold her face. The firelight danced in his eyes, softening the gray bags beneath them to give him a far less weary look. It seemed, for just that moment, he was the boy she had known all her life and not a hardened solider riding to war. Just a beautiful boy with a smile too big for his face and a hope in his heart for all the joys life could bring. \"I know.\" Her fingertips ran through his hair as the muscles in her throat seized together, trying to dam up a wall of tears that were building with a strong and steady force. \"I do not mean to waste those moments.\" Reaching out to the table beside his bed, Melot opened the box he always kept there, full of odd trinkets and mementos from special occasions. From inside he produced a ring of heather and moss, just big enough to fit over her hand and around her wrist. It was a promise wreath. \"What?\" Her voice was reduced to a whisper, unsure if she was hearing him right or simply the way her heart wanted to. \"Daneal, I'm asking that you allow my return home be to a wife. Please?\" The hair around her face brushed his fingers as it shook back and forth with disbelief. At first, the movement made his blood run cold, his heart sink into the depths of his stomach with fear. Was she refusing him? \"I was beginning to fear you would never ask.\" A laugh broke through her words, heavy from the tears, growing stronger as his words sunk in. Her family had been wrong, her doubts had been for nothing at all. He wanted to start a life with her and she felt as though every fiber of her being might rip open from the sheer ecstasy that seemed to be filling every space within. His own deep, resounding laughter mingled with hers in the air between them as relief poured through his veins. \"I should never have hesitated. But I was so afraid to leave you a widow. I saw what it did to my mother, consumed as she was for so many years with grief. I couldn't bear to leave you in such a state.\" \"What changed?\" She asked softly. He was still riding to battle, the risk of his death was as great as ever. And yet, even Daneal could feel a new ease settling over them now. None of it mattered. If she was to grieve, she would be proud to do it as his widow. \"I realized that what I am riding toward is not so important as what I will be leaving here today. What I will be coming home to.\" He kissed her forehead and for a moment they simply grinned into one another's eyes, soaking up the joy. \"Thank you.\" Daneal motioned to her wrist, proudly arranging the wreath along her pale skin. \"I shall never take it off. Even if you're gone for a year.\" He chuckled softly, tucking some of her hair behind her ear, smoothing it affectionately. \"If I am gone for more than a month, I fear I might die of desperation, just so my soul may escape to where it belongs.\" A deep breath filled her lungs and Daneal stepped closer to him, wrapping her arms around his neck and back. He was so warm and solid, the thought of being without that security was already beginning to physically hurt. \"I can't wait to be your wife.\" She whispered, \"I feel as though I have been for it waiting my entire life.\" \"As have I.\" He assured her, voice just as low. Pulling away, he looked down at her with a steady gaze and she could see it there. Everything he felt, everything he was about to say, everything they were and ever would be. Though it pained them both to see him leave, the promise of something to come lifted them both beyond their grief. Even on this night, as he would ride off with the King, she would not be able to keep a smile from her face. \"I will return to you Daneal. I will come back and I will marry you. This I promise.\" With one last kiss and her blessing, he left her there. But she knew, she was not alone. And she never would be again. ","Summary":" A/n: Yeah, I know I'm lame for not updating something else. But this is just a one-shot, so no worr"},{"Movie":"Tristan + Isolde","Title":"For My Love","Author":"butterflygoodbye","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5381351","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A retelling of the Tristan and Isolde story. It's not a tragedy just a romantic adventure that will be dramatic at some point. Disclaimer: I do not own Tristan and Isolde the movie or the legend. AN: Thanks to my beta Han for all her hardwork. She puts up with all my tense mistakes and doesn't mind helping me at any time. Thanks sweetie! Princess Isolde, daughter of King Donnchadh of Ireland and Queen Isolde the Elder, had grown up without her mother by her side. From birth she had been raised by her faithful maid, Bragnae. Being the first and only child of her father did not give her the right to his love, if she had been a son she would have been revered and accepted inexplicably, but since she was just a lowly daughter she didn't give much meaning to her father's life. He had his duty to keep her pure and to provide for her a dowry so that one day he could make the best match for her, but in reality he hadn't loved her mother either so Isolde couldn't expect much from him. It was her duty as a obedient daughter to do as every other woman in her time had done; be a good daughter, wife, and mother. Isolde did everything in her power to please her father, no matter the amount of indifference he showed her. She politely sat at his side every morning while he broke his fast, her hands properly placed in her lap and her back erect. She listened intently, and sometimes in disgust to the conversations that he would have with his menservants and aides, trying to gain any information she could on the ways of politics. She was forbidden to read anything that may help her to become smarter than any \"woman\" should be. All the while she pretended to be servile, on the inside she was bursting with a love for knowledge and her ideas of freedom. Every afternoon she sat in the lady's quarters, her faithful maid by her side, as she carded wool with the other lords's wives and daughters. Carding the wool was necessary to the process of cloth making so that the women could then spin it in to yarn. Every spring season the women would receive the wool shorn from the village sheep so that they could make acceptable winter clothing for all the servants of the house and serfs of the fields. Her father might not care for the serfs but he would not have them dying throughout the winter because they weren't clothed well. A dead serf was just as worthless as a live one, but at least a living one would continue to work and bring money into his coffers. Whenever she wasn't occupied with her other household duties, Isolde would travel out into the surrounding countryside to collect herbs and berries for household and medicinal purposes. This special time in Isolde's day would probably be tiresome for the other girls, many would rather have their servants do it while they stayed inside the keep but Isolde loved the outdoors. The freshness of the air always helped to make her feel better. The rushes strewn on the floor in the front hall and in her bedroom were scented with dried lavender, but that wasn't the same as holding the fresh sprig to your nose after you had just picked it. If Isolde could survive the winter outside she would. Then she wouldn't feel confined. Like a prisoner in her own home. She always felt closer to her mother, who had also dealt in herbs, when she was outside with the sun warming her cheeks while the cool spring breeze whipped her hair, flowing behind her like a banner into battle. If Isolde's mother was the sun then her father was the wind, harsh and unfeeling, bringing damage with it's stormy bluster. But the sun always shone brightly, only the clouds sometimes got in the way, blown by the wind to keep the affectionate sunshine from reaching her. The clouds made Isolde think about the things in life that kept her down; sickness, starvation and the wars that were bountiful. She hated living in Ireland when there was talk about battles and raids fought against the weaker Briton tribes. She thought it was a better idea to think about peace and prosperity instead of which kingdom could do the most damage against the other. But this was man's battle-torn world so she kept her rebellious thoughts to herself. Her father would not approve of these thoughts, she would be severely punished if she ever were to think of speaking such treasonous things. Isolde wasn't naive enough to think that she may someday be given to a man that did not uphold her father's ideals about women being seen and not heard. She could still dream though, couldn't she? Her future husband might care about her enough to value her opinion. At least when she was married she would have her dreams to keep her sane as she went about her wifely duties. Hopefully, in her new home she wouldn't feel as trapped as she did in Ireland. Then she wouldn't worry about becoming depressed like her mother had been before she died. Bragnae had thought her old enough on her last birthday to tell her the real truth about her mother's last days on this earth. Isolde's mother had suffered from depression before she conceived but upon giving birth to a daughter she had felt a failure for not giving her husband and king a heir to carry on the line. Isolde's birth had been her mother's breaking point. Although Isolde mourned for her mother, now knowing what she went through, she did not hold any hate in her heart for her mother even though she had given up on living and had not survived to raise her child. Isolde hoped that she had more of her father's obstinacy and stubbornness, praying that she wouldn't give up on life so easily if her future marriage and motherhood didn't end up being all that she hoped it would be. ------ According to her father, Isolde's betrothed was a great warrior who had killed many men in his day. He was well known for his prowess in battle and was as well known in her native Ireland as he was in his homeland of Cornwall. Her betrothed was not a man of Irish descent, but a Briton. Surprisingly, her father thought he was worthy of her hand and she was worthy enough to bear this warrior's children. Apparently her Irish blood was thicker than that of the weaker Briton blood. Her father apparently had no fear of his descendants being weaklings. Her hope was for Ireland's throne because her son would one day rule the kingdom, and he had to be strong in heart as well as in body to accomplish the task. Tomorrow would bring the tournament that Isolde's betrothed would fight in to prove his worth. He didn't even know her name or what she looked like. But it didn't matter, she hardly knew if she was pleasing to the eye herself; her father did not allow her the pleasure of a mirror of beaten silver to look into, claiming it would just make her vain. She would give in to her feminine insipidness so well known among her peers. She would be veiled so her betrothed would not know her before their engagement week, when she was to travel to his country in the hands of her betrothed's men. Funny how she didn't even know his name, yet she was anxious to meet and study the man who would become her husband. She just hoped he was not as old as she believed him to be. A man of her father's age or older would not be so appealing or as intriguing as one closer to her age. Isolde didn't want her marital bed to be seen as a duty to beget children as it had been for her mother. She believed she deserved some happiness in life that was not dictated by her father. He couldn't be in the room to tell her what to do. Isolde wanted to feel something and not just become a cold fish that would send her husband to the first comely woman he set his eyes on. A woman who would give him what he wanted for a meager price with no attachments. She knew she should feel ashamed for wanting to know about the act of making love, but in truth she did not feel guilty for thinking on it. It was a natural part of life and she would soon know it for what it was, a joining of man and wife. Isolde retired earlier than usual the night before the tournament. As Bragnae said, No bride to be should be likened to a hag on the first sighting by her future husband. How would that make her father and the kingdom look? Irish brides are always as fair as the morning sunrise and just as dewy.[Chapter 2] AN: Sorry it has taken so long to get this next chapter up. My computer crashed and the document was lost but now I'm back and I hope you enjoy this second chapter. Thanks to my beta Han for putting up with me no matter what. All of my stories I owe to you. You always let me bounce ideas off of you and you don't care how many times I send my drafts back to you. Love ya sweetie! Disclaimer: I don't own Tristan + Isolde; the legend or the movie rights. Tristan, son of Lord Aragon and Lady Serafine, had grown up in his father's house. It was situated in a small town called Exeter, Isca Dumnoniorum in the Latin tongue. Their village overlooked a river where the locals would fish to make their living. Ruins of a Roman wall lay close to the their home and Tristan would climb them everyday, watching for riders on the road. One day, when Tristan was nine years old, Lord Marke of Cornwall and his wife Lady Barbara had come to their small village manor to urge Tristan's father to join his cause; to bring the separated tribes of Briton together against King Donnchadh of Ireland and the leader of his army, Morholt. Thinking they were safe from the Irish that cold, rainy night they held a secret meeting in the great hall with all the leaders sitting round the tables enjoying their mead and the crackling of the fire. Their wives sat on the other side of the hall around the warmth of the second hearth as they gossiped and congratulated Lady Marke on the news of her newborn baby son. He had been left at home in Cornwall. The cold weather wasn't appropriate to bring him out in, he might catch cold and they couldn't have Marke's new heir dying before he ever had a chance to live. Tristan had been listening intently to his father and the other men as they argued about whether or not joining Lord Marke was a good idea. Tristan's father, Lord Aragon, thought joining together would make Briton stronger but Tristan figured maybe some of the other leaders just weren't as wise as him. One, Lord Wictred especially grated on his nerves but Tristan always treated him politely seeing as that was how his mother had taught him. Just as everyone had started to quiet down and the parchment for the pact had been brought out, cries of alarm rose from the sentries on duty could be heard. Loud gasps could be heard as the women looked to their husbands for instructions and reassurance. Being only nine years old Tristan was thrust into hiding with his mother, along with the other women and children, despite his protestation that he could fight too. Feeling helpless he grabbed his mother's hand as he tried to comfort her through her tears. A loud crash could be heard through the trap door in the floor where they all hid. Crouching down on the dirt floor Tristan held his mother as yells of outrage and screams of pain could be heard mingled with the sobs and whimpers of the women and children. After many tense moments the door to the cellar was thrown open and a torch was poked through the cavernous hole. A blood-covered Irishman climbed down the ladder along with two other men and grabbed up all the boys and hauled them through the trap door. Tristan didn't like this one bit. He kicked and fought the whole way until he was deposited on the rush covered floor by one of the burly men. Forced to stand up the boys faced the men who had survived the battle. Tristan was glad to see his father and Lord Marke alive though they were not intact. The boys were each handed a sword and were instructed to deal a killing blow to the man in front of him. Tristan, horrified at the though of killing his own father, swung his sword at his and his father's captor instead, severing the man's sword hand. Seeing the bravery of their friend, the other boys hastily attacked the rest of the Irishmen as Tristan cut loose the Britons. After he had freed them all, he handed off his sword to his stunned father and ran toward the cellar to check on the women and the younger children while the Britons fought and killed the remaining men. From that day forward Tristan was known as a great warrior gaining accolades from all the men whose lives he had helped save. Lord Marke was so impressed with his bravery and strength that he promised Lord Aragon that he would train Tristan up as a knight, if he agreed. Although that meant leaving his home and moving to live with Lord Marke's family in Cornwall. Tristan was scared to leave the only life he had known but he knew that he could endure the hardships as long as the end reward was his knighthood. Saying goodbye to his mother and father he left his home and traveled to Cornwall where he was trained for a full ten years alongside Marke's nephew of the same age, Melot. Spending all those years away from home helped Tristan to become a strong man. He forged many lasting relationships with the other men around him, including Lord Marke who he owed his allegiance to. Having ended the Irish raid and what would have been the slaughter of many Briton lords at such a young age, Tristan was very famous among men and women alike but he didn't care for it. When he wasn't practicing his fighting skills or lending advice to Lord Marke, he liked to spend his time alone, but he had a little follower, Wynn, Lord Marke's third son. The ten year old followed him everywhere always pestering him to teach him to fight and offering his childish opinion on everything that Tristan did. He was forever asking Tristan when he could become his sword bearer. It embarrassed Tristan to be constantly trailed and the other knights always teased him about his shadow. Maybe that was Tristan's problem with women, his \"shadow\" always dissuaded them from coming around but in reality Tristan just wasn't interested in any of the local women. Plenty of women would give anything to be with Cornwall's unofficial leading warrior but none of them appealed to him. It didn't really matter to him anyway. He wouldn't have his freedom much longer because his parents had been arranging his marriage to an Irish princess since the end of his years as a squire. At 21 he was now a knight and according to his parents, ready for marriage. Tristan knew he should put some serious thought into the significance of this major change in his life but it was very hard to think about when his future bride was so far away. Isolde the Fair, as she was known in her country, was said to be very beautiful but he was still wary of a marriage to a stranger, and an Irish one at that! Still, there was never any interest between him and any of the young women in Cornwall. He was always too focused on perfecting his skills with the longbow, broadsword and dagger, along with his hunting and riding abilities. A knight's first and most important priority was to look after and protect any and all women, especially those of noble birth so he wouldn't dare neglect the woman that was to become his wife. He just hoped that the responsibility wouldn't be hindered by an unfortunate face or temperament. Tristan sincerely wished that his wife would be his equal and wouldn't shy away from him. Hopefully she wouldn't be too clingy and expect his attention more often that was needed. He was not going to be a servant at her beck and call. He had other duties that he had to accomplish. Having a wife to care for would be a new experience. So far he had only had to care for himself, and a horse or two, since leaving his home and his parents all those years ago. Maybe one day he would have a son that he could take on hunting trips with him. He could congratulate him and a job well done and then carry him home on his shoulders like his father had done when he was a boy. Especially if it brought rewards like he thought it had for his father. One way or another he would find out after he competed in the tournament which would be fought between him and the strongest of Lord Donnchadh's men. Apparently, he wasn't officially engaged to the Princess Isolde until he had bested them in a fight. Hand to hand combat would decide his and the princess's fate. Review if you please! I'd like to know everyone's thoughts. How I'm doing so far? What I can improve on? Anything. :) ","Summary":" A retelling of the Tristan and Isolde story. It's not a tragedy just a romantic adventure that will"},{"Movie":"Tristan + Isolde","Title":"Tristan, Isolde, and the Pearl","Author":"Cara Amnell","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6385421","Passage":"[Chapter 1] (Also by Zoe Alice Latimer) Chapter One Tristan held very still even though the long grass brushed his face. His hand tensed around the knife. \"Now,\" his father whispered, and he darted after the rabbit. The chase was short. First kill of the day, he thought. Little did he knew how many would follow. He smiled up at his father, who was also grinning. \"Can we hunt a stag now?\" \"A stag?\" Father laughed. \"You promised,\" Tristan reminded. \"Someday, Tristan,\" his father promised again. He did not say, \"You're too slight to take on a stag quite yet,\" which was true but not unknown to Tristan. They walked back to the city, Tristan with one hand around the limp coney's hind legs, the other in the fold of his tunic. \"Never go home without an offering for your lady,\" his father always said. He ran his fingers over the ridges of the twisted branch and red buds. I hope Mother likes it. \"Stay close to me,\" Father murmured as they connected to the flow inside the city gates. Of course, Tristan didn't- he ran off to a stall, then to his mother. \"I made this for you,\" he told her, and brought out the bracelet. She gave him a lovely smile, working her soft fingers through his tangled curls. \"Thank you, my son.\" Nightfall found Tristan and his family in a small room with men seated around a table. Tristan sat close to the fire to roast the rabbit. He wasn't paying complete attention to what his father was saying to the other man; he kept glancing over at his mother. Finally he caught her gaze, and she smiled and lifted her hand so he could see that she was wearing his gift. He smiled in something much like relief, and began to focus on what his father was so passionately saying. He, Lord Marke, and the other tribe leaders were shouting about uniting under Lord Marke to overthrow the oppression of the marauding Irish. \"Now is the time to strike,\" Marke urged. Tristan leaned forward as Marke continued, \"My wife's delivery is near, and I feel in my heart that she will bear a son. He will inspire us.\" A man burst through the door with a yelp. \"The Irish are attacking!\" The room exploded into chaos. Tristan heard screaming from outside the room. \"Women and children to the back!\" Lord Marke roared. Tristan tried to rip away from his mother's grip. \"Let me fight!\" \"No, Tristan!\" she cried. They were already separated by a stormy sea of panicking people. Tristan fought through to his father. \"I need to fight!\" His father was wild-eyed. \"Hide, my son!\" The first wave of Irishman broke in. Tristan's father shoved him toward Lord Marke, who was hastily lowering his wife under a trap door. Tristan protested, but soon he and Lord Marke's pregnant wife, who was starting to have contractions, were confined under the floor. The screams above mingled with battle cries. Someone thudded heavily on top of the trapdoor. A crackling noise and heat beat down. Someone had set a fire, Tristan guessed. Lord Marke's hyperventilating wife was clutching Tristan's shoulders to keep from screaming in pain while they waited out the screeches and sobs to hush. Footsteps tramped away and faded. Tristan laid his hand on the trapdoor, but quickly recoiled. In the dim, smoky light, he stared at the blood dripping between his fingers, then fearfully at the pregnant woman. She choked back another cry. He put both hands on the trapdoor and heaved. The door opened slowly. Tristan wiggled out under it and the body weighting it down. When he turned to help Lord Marke's wife crawl out, he nearly vomited. The corpse, severed at the waist, still gushed blood; but what made him sick was that the mangled corpse was his father. He staggered back into the devastation. Bloody bodies- almost all tribesman- littered the floor. With broken possessions. Fire flared in one of the corners. Tristan gasped. One of the motionless forms seemed to be stretching out her hand, and the around the wrist wound a bracelet of twisted buds and branches. No. Not Mother too. If I had stayed with her, I could have protected her. He moved to go to her when Lord Marke's wife shrieked, scrambling toward Tristan with one hand on her swollen belly. An Irishman appeared from the smoke and lunged for the two with his sword. Someone else stepped in front of him, skewering the Irishman before he could reach Tristan and Marke's wife. The Irishman's sword slice through his wrist from the momentum, chopping his hand off. The Irishman went down, dead. Their rescuer turned to face them, trying to bind his blood-spurting hand. \"Lord Marke!\" Tristan cried. Lord Marke's wife surged forward and clung to his waist, sinking to the floor. Tristan felt, rather than anything else, someone stir behind him. He whirled just as the outstretched fingers of his mother flexed and curled up. He ran to her side and helped her to her feet. \"I thought you were dead,\" he whispered. She shook her head, putting her arms around him. \"I think... I think I hit my head. Oh, Tristan, you're alive. But not your father.\" Lord Marke's wife screamed. Tristan's mother's eyes cleared through her tears. She flew to Marke, Tristan on her heels. \"Is she injured?\" \"She's in labor,\" he said. \"It's too early! What can I do?\" \"Move over,\" Tristan's mother commanded. \"I've delivered children before.\" She knelt. \"Try to stay calm...\" Tristan stood stiffly, trying not to think of his father. Trying to process anything else. Wishing he could be helpful. Wishing his life and the entire village weren't burning down around him. \"It's a girl, my lord,\" Tristan's mother called out. Lord Marke looked startled. His wife wept, \"Let me hold her. My pearl.\" But her life faded before their eyes. Lord Marke took the screaming, bloody, wet baby in his good hand and nearly dropped her. Tristan watched as he began to cry like a little girl. Tristan understood. None of this should have happened. And yet... something about this moment was beautiful. \"You,\" Lord Marke rasped to the baby, \"you will live. You will live. I promise you.\" \"I promise you,\" Tristan echoed. From the time they fled the burning village and healed, Tristan trained under Lord Marke of the One Hand to fight against the Irish, and to fight for Mairead, the pearl born that tragic night.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Mairead watched as Tristan brought out his full strength to attack his opponent. They were just fighting in the dusty practice ring, but the sweat dripping from Tristan's matted curls was real- as was his intense concentration. The constancy of his offense was astounding; Mairead felt that she hadn't time to breathe. Her father could barely hold his own in the duel. Mairead knew that Tristan would win, and later Lord Marke would laugh and tell Tristan that he had only won because he had the advantage of two hands. Tristan had grown strong since the day of her birth, although of course she couldn't remember that. It had been nine years since that day, and Tristan was a man. My protector. From what she had heard, the role had been a close thing. He might have gone mad on the day of her birth if not for his mother's survival... and someone smaller he could latch onto to protect: her. \"No!\" Tristan said. \"Bu-u-ut... Why can't I defend our people?\" Mairead asked. \"Listen, it's very dangerous. You can not come to the ambush because then I will be too distracted trying to protect you...\" Mairead zoned out, mentally picturing how she would fight and save everyone, and Tristan would be astonished at her skill. I never should have tried to make you stay back and waste all your brilliance cooking soup! he would say in front of everyone. Tristan interrupted her daydreaming. \"Do you hear me? You won't come, right?\" Not actually sure what he had said, she thought it safe to say, \"Right.\" He smiled and hugged her. \"I'll be back after. Maybe you can surprise me by making your famous lamb stew.\" \"It's not a surprise if you tell me to make it,\" Mairead pointed out, but she nodded, embraced by his warmth. She loved him; she loved him as the older brother he pretended to be. He walked away, waving one more time before he joined the ambush party. Mairead dashed into her house, pulled on armor that was slightly large for her, took her bow and quiver, and ran to the woods where she could follow Tristan without being spotted. Why does he always have to be uptight? Like the time he found out I fancied Brodie. I am nine years old; he doesn't need to protect me like that... The thoughts kept going as she ran to the woods. The ambush had already begun as Mairead dived into the bushes, waiting for the right time to attack. No one seemed worthy of her attention... except the huge man leading the raid! She came out of hiding and drew the bow, took aim, and fired. The giant chuckled as the arrow went past his body harmlessly, infuriating Mairead. She drew again and this time grazed his arm. The man grunted and glanced around to find the annoying bad shot. Panic knifed Mairead in the stomach as the giant's gaze locked with hers. He gave an evil grin and charged her. Tristan grunted with satisfaction as his opponent fell dead at his feet. He looked up and around trying to find where he was most needed, and then he saw Mairead. Fear gripped Tristan as he saw the giant of a man charging her. \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" Tristan heard himself bellow. Without even thinking, he ran faster than he ever had before with one thought in his mind: Protect Mairead to the death. Tristan was not quick enough. He saw the man stab at Mairead. She jumped to the side but the sword sliced her arm. That was when Tristan leaped at the man. He brought his sword down, causing the man to turn his full attention on Tristan. The man kicked Tristan in the gut. \" Run !\" he yelled to Mairead. She didn't respond, immediately drained of color. She was half-doubled over. I do not have time for this! Tristan thought desperately, flinging sweat out of his eyes as he looked at the giant man. I have to get to that stupid girl! With renewed strength, he jabbed, his opponent so shocked at the ferocity of Tristan that he was unable to block the sword. Tristan rammed it through his stomach and forced him to the ground- dead. \"Mairead!\" he hollered. \"Mairead, what are you do-\" He broke off as Mairead, looking sickeningly the way her mother had nine years before, swayed and fell to the ground. Mairead could not move. In fact, she could not breathe. Yet she was alive, and she could feel the poison in her blood. Yes, she was alive. But not for long. She rocked in a way that she knew but could not place. The air was cold and she heard only a swishing, lapping sort of sound, like wind and whispers of wind. Maybe she was dead. It was hard to tell... The movement jerked to a stop. She fell forward, and the already black world slipped from her mind.[Chapter 3] Aine, Tristan's mother, didn't have to say a word in order to share Lord Marke's grief. The two had understood each other ever since the night their spouses died. They never needed to explain to each other, only to be near. That was why Aine had joined his movement so quickly - somewhat for Tristan's sake, somewhat because Marke had probably saved their lives, but mostly because they had both lost everything but their children. And now they had lost that, too. Aine tipped her head back to study the grainy beams of the ceiling as Lord Marke held his head in his hands. She told herself, You have no right to feel sorry for yourself while Lord Marke grieves. Tristan is alive. But she couldn't help feeling that she had lost him. Ever since they had pushed off Mairead's funeral boat, he had been - wrong. Marke broke the silence with a shuddering breath. \"I wish I had spent half as much time with Mairead as I did planning warfare. Yet, everyone will expect me to avenge her...\" Marke massaged him temps. \"I am so tired now.\" Abruptly, he broke off, locking eyes with Aine. \"I haven't caught sight of Tristan since yester eve. I can only assume he's handled it badly.\" Aine glanced over her shoulder, turned back, and lowered her voice. \"He keeps visiting their old haunts: the big oak, the bend in the river. I think he is looking for her, my lord. And he keeps springing up behind me like an arrow -\" \"Hello, Mother.\" Tristan leaned to kiss her cheek. Aine jumped, pressing a hand over her pounding heart. She raised her eyebrows significantly at Marke. \"I see what you mean,\" he murmured. Tristan stepped forward, bowing. His hand never left his sword hilt. \"My lord.\" \"Tristan, my son.\" Lord Marke's brow wrinkled. \"You seem... tolerably well.\" \"I am very ill, my lord,\" Tristan contradicted. \"But it is nothing Mairead's stew will not fix. Brew, stew. Lamb stew.\" Aine felt sick. \"Tristan, Mairead will not be making stew tonight. Or any night. Please think back.\" Tristan's eyes darkened. \"Don't say it. You all say it. But Mairead - she's only gone for a little while.\" \"Dead,\" said Lord Marke bluntly. Aine felt the pain that made him so sharp and cruel about it. Restlessly, the lord stood and walked toward Tristan. \"We must both face it and move on.\" Tristan backed away toward the door, wild-eyed. \"She is not. I can feel her calling. She's nearby, only far away. Both. But finding her is not impossible. That is what we must do, or at least, I must.\" His fist tightened around his sword. \"And whoever keeps me from her will pay.\" \"Then you will be charging many Irish with death,\" Lord Marke said wearily, touching Tristan's shoulder. \"They took her in the first place.\" Tristan's pupils seemed to focus, straighten out. For one moment he looked thoughtfully lucid. Aine felt hope rise in her heart. Tristan pulled from Marke's grip as he pivoted for the door. \"Lamb stew,\" he muttered. Mairead's eyelids were so heavy. When she was finally able to open them, she saw that she was in a dark hut. She tried to sit up, but there was an unbelievable pain in her arm. It took everything she had not to let tears fall. Where am I? What's wrong with my arm? Before she could do anything, the door to the hut opened and a beautiful woman entered. She smiled at Mairead. \"Hello. How are you feeling?\" Gods! She's Irish! Why didn't I find anything to defend my self with? Tristan would kill me! Tristan! \"Where is Tristan? Who are you? Where am I? What's wrong with my arm?\" Mairead could have asked more questions but the woman raised her hand. \"My name is Isolde. I don't know who Tristan is. I found you on the beach. You were unconscious, and you had a deep poisoned cut on your arm. I have hid you here, and no one but my maidservant Bragnae and I know about you. I have dressed your arm with the antidote. You will be fine and will be in full health soon.\" Isolde finished and smiled. Tristan crept to the shoreline. The wooden boat creaked as he sat in it, rocking on the sand and trying to inch toward the water. Tristan heard a voice and ducked, waiting for whoever it was to pass. A few moments later, all was quiet. He wondered if he'd imagined it. He sat up and took an oar in each hand, pushing off into the sea in Ireland's general direction. Lord Marke had given him the idea. If Mairead was alive, and Tristan knew she was, she'd be in Ireland. The though made his blood race. He'd kill any Irish who touched her. And so he stole a boat. Did he know the direction? Not really. But woe betide whoever got in his way. Isolde and Mairead spent as much time together as possible. Mairead told Isolde all about Tristan and her family and everything else. Isolde told Mairead all about growing up a princess and growing up in the castle and life in Ireland . They also figured out that Isolde's betrothed was dead. Weeks passed, and Mairead and Isolde felt like sisters. Bragnae seemed like the nitpicking mother. \"Isolde, we should leave. Your father will get suspicious.\" \"It's fine, Bragnae. You need to stop worrying,\" Isolde said. \"Come sit down with us. You don't need to look out. No one ever comes out this way.\" Isolde didn't realize how wrong she was, because at this very moment Tristan was scouring the beach for Mairead.

She had long black hair, braided down her back. She wore boys clothes. Behind her, her father watched silently as she stalked the rabbit. The rabbit twitched at her presence. She bolted forward. She carried home her prize within two minutes. \"Good kill, Alys.\" her father praised as they entered Cornwall's castle, in all its wooden glory. Alys ran to the hearth, and her rabbit cooked on the spit. Her mother approached behind her, as her father and Cornwall's knights discussed the issue with Ireland. Her mother was beautiful, and such glory was to be expected when ones parents were Roman diplomats. But Rome had fallen, nearly fifty years ago, and her mother had aged. \"Mother, what do you think will happen?\" Alys asked, not turning from the fire. \"Such worries are much too old for such a young mind\" her mother said. Alys hated when she did that. Answered with out ever really answering. Then, Sir Marke got the attention of everyone. \"People,\" he said, \"My wife is with child, and already I can tell it is a boy. I do not want my son to be raised in a land filled with fear and hatred. We must make peace with the Irish!\" But no one had time to object, because the castle was lit on fire.

No one can. He has muddy river hair. And olive green eyes. His father walks in front of him, a shriveling, sniveling lump of a man. Not the regal king he should be. He looks to his father's right, and his heart sinks once more. Where normally his mother would be, is empty. She is dead. And he forgot. Hours later, a messenager returns from England. The Cornwall palace has been burnt to the ground. The enemies have been abolished. Terrin feels the remorse he knows his father cannot feel. No such truce can be made when such hate dominates the two lands. NINE YEARS LATER Alys is nineteen. Her cousins Melot and Brodkin have yet to return from their \"journey\". She leaves the Cornwall castle, in all its stone glory, to see her town. She and her cousins and her uncle rebuilt the town after the Irish burnt it to the ground. After the Irish killed so many, with no such hint of remorse. She still wears mens' clothes. Alys glances over the town. People have rebuilt their lives, their families. She remembers the last time she seen her parents, her brother, or her sister. Painfully clear, she sees their burnt bodies on the ground in front of her ten year old self. She swore vengence. No Irish being would be spared from her wrath. Her cousins return, laughing, and loud, on horse back. They dismount, approaching her. Her cousin Melot, with his dark hair and eyes, ducks in close. \"Come on, Alys, we found some ruins. They have tunnels that go at least five miles out.\" He whispers. They cloak themselves, and disappear in the crowd. If anyone seen them heading to ruins, Marke would have their heads. It was still forbidden to leave the town with out permission, even though the last attack was five years ago. When they are safely tucked away in the woods, they lose their cloaks. The day was warm, and it was still early. The day was destined to be a scorcher. They slipped through the cool, green underbrush, and came upon the ruin. \"Its a damn building.\" she says, bluntly. \"Not even a building. Its just pillars with some bush growing in the center.\" Brodkin laughs. \"Alys, its whats underneath the bush. Come on, use that pretty little head of yours.\" She groans at the remark. She, unfortunetly, inheirated her mothers beauty at the age of twelve, and since then has been a prize of sorts. She has also been called a fool, because according to Marke, beauty did not come with brains. How wrong they were. Alys enters the ruin, and comes across a trap door. She yanks it open. She jumps into the dusty tunnels, and hears her cousins follow. She explores the tunnels for hours, finding trap doors and secret entrances into buildings of Cornwalls. \"Scandolous, those Romans were.\"[Chapter 3] Terrin wandered the cloudy shores, picking up stones as he went. The clouds rumbled, like angry gray fists, ready to strike any moment. It was the ability to note such things that made Terrin's father so angry and blind to his son's point of view. The Irish king's mood often resembled the clouds. \"Terrin!\" called a familiar voice from the fog. \"Your father needs to see you!\" \"Coming!\" he yelled in return. He walked quickly to the gloomy stone castle. Terrin entered the throne room, the place where his mother had spent so much time when he was younger. Before he let his heart feel the ache it always did in this room, his father appeared from the shadowy throne. \"Son,\" he greeted darkly. \"Father\" \"There is something we need to discuss. I am getting older, and less able to rule. It is time for you to marry. There are many eligible brides for you.\" \"Father, can I not-' \"Terrin you must.\" \"But father, I don't want a forced marriage. You did not have an arranged marriage so why must I?\" \"Because it is a desperate time! When I was ready, this kingdom was a peaceful place! There will be no more arguments! You have a fort night to choose.\" The king yelled. \"I must leave to Cornwall, for an attack.\" \"Good bye father\" XxXxXx Alys emerged from the tunnels. They were always finding new ruins from the Roman rule. Suddenly, a cry cut through the forest. The cousins ran to the castle. \"Marke! The Irish! They are near!\" Brodkin cried. \"I know, nephew.\" \"Wait, Marke, I have an idea\" Alys said, suddenly. Melot looked into her gray eyes, already knowing her plans. XxXxXx Alys hid in a bush, a quiver on her back. Behind her, Melot rustled. All at once, a cloud of dust and the yells of Irishmen flooded them. The Irish were fast, but Alys' army was faster. In an instant, they flew from the tunnels, bushes and trees. Arrows and swords flew. Alys could see the Irish general. She flew at him, dagger in hand. In a quick, fluent motion, she slit his throat. Though not before the man sliced her shoulder with his sword. A sword coated in poison. The dust settled, and Melot looked for Alys. Brodkin lay in a bush, unconscious. Then, he seen her. Her body lay on the road, a deep gash on her shoulder and blood soaking her clothes. \"Alys!\" he cried. But she did not respond. Hearing Melot's desperation, Marke ran over. \"Father, Alys is dead.\" Alys' body lie in a boat, surrounded in pine branches. Her black hair cascaded down her body. Her only dress covered her corpse as her family cast her out to sea. X Terrin wandered the green shores when he seen the boat. He ran down to the beach. A girl lay in it. She had cascading black hair and she wore an ornate evergreen dress. He ducked his head down to her mouth. Shallow breaths escaped. She was still alive. He carried her body to a door in the cliff.

News of Harriet's expulsion had sent shockwaves through the school among both teachers and pupils. Poppy knew that it could not just end there and decided to pay a final visit to her enemy. Harriet shared a room with Jane and Charlotte her former deputy prefects. The two girls had been Harriet's shadow following her around as she prowled the corridors of Abbey Mount catering to her every whim. Yet they had stayed in the lacrosse team after Mrs Kingsley had replaced Harriet as captain and she had left. Jane and Charlotte's questioning of Harriet during the court had tipped the scales in exposing her lies. They were now friends of Poppy. Poppy knocked on the door and Jane opened it \"I have come to talk to Harriet\" Jane stepped aside and motioned to Charlotte to follow her out of the room. Poppy stepped inside. At the end of the large room stood a number of packing cases filled with books and clothes. The wall over Harriet's bed had been stripped bare and the dressing table likewise. Looking out of the window across the playing field at the front of Abbey Mount stood Harriet Bentley. Poppy was shocked; Harriet had always been immaculate, her uniform pressed and iron, shoes polished to a shine, her French plait without a hair out of place. Now Harriet looked like a wreck, her eyes red and puffy from crying, the plait dishevelled the Abbey Mount school badge on her blazer torn off, her tie askew, and the red Head Girl badge worn so proudly on the lapel gone. Poppy had heard the rumour of an angry Mrs Kingsley tearing the badge from a shaking Harriet as she stood in the office after the court. Freddie had confirmed it had happened. He also had told her that afterwards it was the first time since the death of his father that he had heard his mother cry. \"Come to gloat?\" Harriet said turning to face Poppy \"No\" she replied \"I came to ask you why? Why do you hate me so much Harriet? Me? Poppy Moore from Malibu, I don't understand why and I want to know before you leave\" Harriet looked at Poppy her eyes wide and her nose flared just as Poppy remembered from the Honour Court \"You, you. You're a nightmare! I had everything here. I was the head girl and everything was in its place and then you come along and you took it away! Everything! Lacrosse, Freddie, Mrs Kingsley...she never spoke of me as she did you! All Poppy Moore! Everything! I couldn't let you get away with it\" Harriet pointed her finger at Poppy \"You started it! You started it!\" Poppy looked at Harriet and smiled \"I took Freddie away from you? How exactly Harriet? He told me he felt nothing for you. You never interested him in the slightest. Ever.\" Harriet stood as if struck. Poppy continued \"Lacrosse? As captain you sucked Harriet! How many games did you win? Eh? None! Your team couldn't stand you, they didn't respect you. Even Jane and Charlotte couldn't wait to see you leave. It was all about you Harriet and never about Abbey Mount. As head girl when did you ever help anyone? You swaggered around lording it over everyone making everyone \"respect you\" That is not respect Harriet that is fear! Fear of you abusing your power to get back at anyone you didn't like. A bully Harriet that is all you ever were a strutting egoist with a badge and nothing else!\" The girls were close now, Harriet was whimpering and Poppy continued \"I should hate you Harriet but I just can't.

Poppy More...always Poppy More; Ever since she had arrived at the start of term she had been a thorn in her side, never showing her the respect that as Head Girl she was entitled to by right; Playing pranks on teachers and on her, pushing her aside from Freddie, taking away his attention. Making everyone like her...God she how she hated Poppy Bloody More! It was time to finally get her out and return things at Abbey Mount to how they were meant to be. Poppy wanted out of Abbey Mount anyway so she would be simply assisting her departure really...Poppy was an annoying little insect that needed stamping on. Suddenly Harriet felt very alone in the room. Jane and Charlotte had stayed in the team after she had been dropped as captain and it was clear they both liked Poppy. Her maid Isabel was almost the team mascot now! Mrs Kingsley forever giving praise and attention to the team; Praise that she had never shown to her...The first time she had won a game as captain Kingsley had replaced her for Poppy telling the assembly the news almost as an afterthought, humiliating her in front of everyone...Everything was ruined and it was all Poppy's fault. She had earned the position of Head Girl through her spotless discipline and academic record; enforcing the schools rules and upholding the system and if that had made her unpopular then so be it: Now though she felt very alone at Abbey Mount... Harriet turned away from the window and walked out of her room heading towards the school library. She needed to draw up a plan to remove that annoying nuisance Poppy. As she walked up the corridor she met Mrs Kingsley \"Harriet, I was just thinking about you, would you care for a walk in the grounds? I do feel we should talk\" \"Yes of course Mrs Kingsley I would be delighted\" Harriet followed Mrs Kingsley outside onto the school grounds and pointed to the playing field \"The girls are playing well I see. I have noticed Harriet that you don't play lacrosse any more? I am surprised as I know how much you enjoy the sport\" Mrs Kingsley stopped and looked at Harriet directly in the eye \"May I ask why?\" Harriet replied with a nervous laugh \"Mrs Kingsley! I...I...just felt that a change was needed that was all\" Mrs Kingsley raised her eyebrows and sighed before walking on \"Really Harriet? And there was me thinking it was you being upset at being dropped as captain\" Mrs Kingsley walked on followed by Harriet who felt a growing sick feeling \"I know exactly why you left the team and I am disappointed in you\" \"Mrs Kingsley? I don't understand?\" Mrs Kingsley walked on with a determined stride \"Miss Reese-Withers told me that she had never seen the girls play as well as when Poppy came on after Jennifer \"Took ill\" as she called it. Against your wishes I might add. The girls followed Poppy as if she was their captain and not you. I know you took your replacement as a personal slight but it was for the good of Abbey Mount. As captain, Harriet, you never won a game; Poppy on the other hand has taken our team further than anyone since 1977!\" Mrs Kingsley stopped and turned to face Harriet. \"Harriet you are the Head Girl of this school and you are diligent in your duties but the position is not just about upholding school rules. It is about setting an example of behaviour to the other girls especially the juniors. It is about leadership. Throwing a sulk is not setting an example! Neither is being petulant! That is not displaying leadership. I don't expect you and Poppy to be friends, you are both very different people but I do expect, no I demand that you to show her respect for the fine job she is doing as captain. Just as I know you would demand it from her.\" Harriet stood trembling, never before had Mrs Kingsley spoken to her in such a way. Mrs Kingsley pointed at the badge pinned on Harriet's lapel \"And furthermore \"Respect\" isn't about having a badge on your blazer. It is about what is behind the badge that counts. Being the Head Girl is not a licence for you to bully and belittle those girls you don't approve of. That stops you understand me Harriet? It stops.\" Mrs Kingsley walked on in silence and then stopped and faced a now flushed and trembling Harriet \"During the last assembly I called up each team member to show them how proud the school is of them. You remained silent and that silence has echoed through the school. I didn't like what I saw and it has added to the doubts I have had about your suitability as Head Girl for some time. How do you think Jane and Charlotte must have felt? They aren't just your deputies they are your roommates, your friends I had thought. Your personal animosity towards Poppy is a private matter between yourselves but I will not tolerate it undermining this school. I know that rivalries happen between the girls here but I am concerned this feud it is far going beyond that. Again I do not expect you to be friends but I do expect you to at least respect each other, especially from you Harriet. Especially from you\" Harriet finally snapped \"Mrs Kingsley! Poppy is just an awful bitch! I hate her! I hate her! Ever since she came here she has spoiled things! I cannot allow her to turn this school upside down. I cannot let her ruin everything for me! She started it Mrs Kingsley! She started it!\" Mrs Kingsley replied softly \"Another outburst like that Harriet and I will dismiss you right here and now...Poppy has had her difficulties since coming here I know but look at her now? She fills this school with fun and a zest for life. She is a true Abbey Mount Girl but the question I am asking myself more and more is; Are you? What are the values we stand for eh? Scholarship; Loyalty; Fellowship; Do you really live up to those values Harriet?\" Mrs Kingsley paused \"If Poppy can change for the better then perhaps you can; You need to Harriet. For if you do not and you continue your feud with Poppy or seek to hurt her in anyway then I will break you. Put no doubt in your mind on that\" Mrs Kingsley looked the trembling Harriet in the eye and added softly \"Being Head Girl means thinking about Abbey Mount and not about yourself; I have known you since your first day; There is much good in you Harriet, you are highly intelligent, confident and authoritative: The First Years are in awe of you. You are a force for order at Abbey Mount that I value. Any shortcomings you have as Head Girl are mine as your headmistress. We should have had this chat sooner but I am glad that now we understand each other and together we can move on. For sake of Abbey Mount\" Harriet fought back her tears \"I will Mrs Kingsley I promise you\" \"I don't doubt that you will Harriet\" Mrs Kingsley took a final look around the grounds \"What a lovely evening; It was nice walking with you now I really must get on\" Mrs Kingsley patted Harriet on the arm and turned back towards the school building. Harriet looked at Mrs Kingsley as she walked away. When she was out of view she collapsed on the bench. It was awful! She had tried so hard as Head Girl. Stalking the corridors with Jane and Charlotte behind her seeking out rule breakers, upholding standards of good behaviour, upholding the rigid system that had made Abbey Mount great, the juniors jumping when she growled! Every girl's head turned towards her. Out of respect...Only now she wasn't so sure. When she had told her parents about being replaced as lacrosse captain her father's reaction was only to ask if Poppy had been a success and if so to give her all the support she needed. Everything at Abbey Mount was coming apart. \"Harriet are you okay? We have been looking for you for hours\" Harriet walked into her room and saw Jane and Charlotte standing there \"Did you win?\" \"Yes! We are in the County Final! \" said the two girls together. Harriet felt sick to her stomach \"I am glad; I really pleased for you. I...I have been thinking that I haven't been much of a friend to either of you and I am sorry...I should be sorry about many things me thinks\" Jane and Charlotte looked at each other; this was not the Harriet they were used to at all. They were so careful never to talk about the team successes in front of Harriet, wary of her changes of mood, quick temper and her loathing of Poppy. Sharing a room with Harriet since Poppy had arrived at Abbey Mount was like treading on eggshells. But this was a very different Harriet. All her force and swagger had gone. Harriet looked shattered and vulnerable. Harriet sat on her bed and sighed \"Everyone at Abbey Mount hates me don't they? Jane and Charlotte looked at each other \"Well...Not hated exactly...\" Charlotte began \"All the Head Girls before you were very quiet girls and everyone liked them but you aren't like that\" Jane looked sharply at Charlotte adding \"You uphold the system Harriet. You make sure the girls keep to the rules and they respect you and yes they fear you too. We walk behind you and we feel that as well\" Charlotte nodded \"You believe in Abbey Mount but you want to be at the centre of attention all the time. Poppy More is the only girl I have ever known here who has ever stood up to you and you just can't handle it. It has carried on from there. I don't think you are a bad person Harriet but you hate Poppy\" Harriet finally asked what had gnawed at her for weeks \"Fredster...Freddie has never liked me at all has me?\" Harriet looked from Jane to Charlotte \"He doesn't have a crush on me at all\" and sat down on her bed her head in her hands. Charlotte and Jane both sat down on either side of her \"No Harriet he doesn't\" said Jane \"We didn't want to see you hurt, we wanted to make you feel good about yourself. That is what Charlotte and I have been doing for ages now and to be honest we are both tired of it really. Freddie likes Poppy and not you. We saw them kiss at the Social and we promised to say nothing to you\" Harriet began to cry \"I have been a fool. I will change; I want to change\" Jane and Charlotte both put their arms around the shaking Harriet \"You are our Head Girl\" said Jane taking Harriet by the hand \"We are loyal to you and we will help you\" After a while Harriet stopped crying, dried her eyes and stood up straightening her uniform \"I am going to see the rest of the team and tell them how pleased I am of them. I am also going to find Isabel; I have been horrid towards her and I want to say sorry. I may even speak to Little Miss USA but that might be a little bit harder!\" Harriet and the girls laughed. Harriet moved towards the door and then turned and walked to her dressing table. She stood for a moment looking at the pictures of Freddie that covered it and then tore them off, screwing them into a ball and putting it into the bin. She then walked out like the Harriet Bentley of old; Head erect shoulders back, back straight like a ramrod. When the door closed and the sound of her footsteps died away Charlotte said to Jane \"I thought we couldn't stand Harriet?\" Jane \"So did I but Harriet seems changed and I like it. Me thinks we should help her\" Charlotte smiled \"Me thinks so too!\" Harriet walked through the Abbey Mount building. She saw Miss Reese- Withers talking with Mr Nellis who upon seeing Harriet rapidly moved away \"I just wanted to say well done for bringing the team to the finals Miss Reese-Withers. You must be very proud\" \"Thank you Harriet! That is very gracious of you to say that. I know you were hurt by the change of captaincy but it was for the best\" Harriet swallowed \"Yes I see that now and I am sorry for well...being childish about it; I wasn't any good as captain and the girls needed better\" Miss Reese-Withers smiled sadly \"No Harriet you just needed a better teacher than me; We both needed to learn that from Poppy More...Come back to play, I know you aren't friends but you enjoy the game so play it\" Harriet nodded and walked away. Harriet walked to the First Years girls rooms. As she walked up the corridors girls moved from her path. Harriet stopped with one girl and then another asking them about their day. As she walked on she didn't see the beaming smiles on the girls she had spoken too. She walked on to see Isabel with three of her friends. A look of fear went to the ginger haired freckled features of Isabel, Harriet winced inwardly seeing it \"I don't want to disturb you but I wanted to say that...well I know that I have been horrid with you and I am sorry\" Isabel gasped \"Harriet...thank you\" \"I meant it Isabel: You are not my slave and I shouldn't have treated you as one. I hope you can forgive me\" Isabel smiled and the two girls exchanged the briefest of hugs. Harriet felt tears come to her eyes again and she walked away watched by four open mouthed First Year girls. Harriet composed herself and walked again at her steady gait down the corridor. In the common rooms where the girls could relax outside of school hours Harriet walked up to the lacrosse players in the team and shook hands and exchanged hugs. She told each girl of her pride in their success and laughed at her own failure as captain. Each time Harriet felt the better for doing it. Finally she reached the room occupied by Poppy, Kate, Josie, Drippy and Kikki. Harriet hesitated. This was not going to be easy at all. \"Come in\" Harriet recognised Drippy's voice and she stepped inside. Poppy and her three roommates stopped talking \"What do you want Harriet?\" asked Poppy \"I heard the news of you all reaching the County final and I wanted to say how pleased and proud I am\" The four girls looked at each other and the awkward silence grew until Kate finally said softly \"Thank you Harriet. I think that must have been very hard for you\" Harriet laughed dryly \"More than you will ever know Kate. I was a horrid captain I know that now. Possibly I make a better player but anyway that is what I wanted to say\" Harriet turned away and then walked to Poppy. She felt the familiar feeling of hate rise through her when she looked at Poppy but she remembered Mrs Kingsley's words as well \"I also wanted to say to you Poppy...that you are a far better captain than I ever was and that I apologise for well...I apologise for everything between us\" Poppy looked at Harriet open mouthed without replying. Harriet looked around at the four girls and said \"I am sorry\" and left. As she walked away \"Harriet\" she turned and saw Poppy standing by the door \"Harriet...You can't help being you and I can't help being me\" The two girls looked at each other until Harriet gave the briefest of smiles and nodded before walking away. \"Do you think she meant all that?\" asked Drippy \"Yes I think she did\" said Kate, Poppy nodded \"I am so used to thinking of her as my enemy\" \"God that was brave\" said Kate \"Telling everyone what a failure you have been. Harriet is proud and that would have hurt her\" \"Aye she is that but I am proud of her\" The girls turned to see Matron standing by the doorway \"And that Poppy More was very gracious of you\" Matron smiled then turned away quickly \"Lights out girls!\" Mrs Kingsley sat at her desk and examined the school caretakers report on the state of the school buildings. The wiring in particular needed replacing particularly in the kitchens. She would put out an appeal to the parents who hopefully would dig deep. The next big occasion was the County lacrosse final which were being held at Abbey Mount. She would get Harriet to make a speech to the parents appealing for funds. Harriet made Mrs Kingsley think of their walk in the grounds: She hadn't meant to be so brutal with her but it seemed to have done the trick. Harriet going among her old teammates to praise their success had raised everyone's opinion of her; her relationship with Poppy had certainly improved from the previous open hostility. Now they just either ignored each other or spoke with icy politeness. As much as Harriet irritated her she wanted her to do well; the previous obnoxious arrogance appeared to have gone. The pompousness remained but she could cope with that. She felt that she had lanced a boil by speaking so directly with Harriet about her attitude to Poppy. Obviously Freddie was a factor but it was a personality clash also. Mrs Kingsley didn't exactly approve of Freddie being fought over by girls at the school but Poppy was a nice girl and certainly more to her taste than Harriet. She wondered what would have happened if she hadn't got involved? Would Harriet and Poppy had made peace or would something terrible have happened between them? Mrs Kingsley mused and closed the report; God willing the school wouldn't burn down. Harriet woke up; ever since her walk with Mrs Kingsley she had trouble sleeping. Today she had heard of Poppy going on a date with Freddie. The whole school had heard! She had purposely kept her encounters with Freddie formal but it hurt so much. Jane and Charlotte had stood up for her when Drippy had made a remark during practise poking fun at her resulting in Poppy stepping in to stop it. She got out of bed deciding she would have a glass of water. She put on her dressing gown and quietly left the room. Hopefully she would avoid Drippy on one of her night time raids on the kitchen freezer. As she walked down the corridor she glanced out of the window; The kitchen was on fire! Harriet quickly went back up the corridor and hit the fire alarm with her elbow, she then went back to her room and shook Jane, Charlotte and Isabel awake \"We need to take charge of the juniors and get them out! Remember if we stay calm so will they. Isabel? You go to the quad. We will join you directly\" Harriet, Jane and Charlotte walked calmly towards the juniors rooms. Each girl knocked on the rooms they passed. Kate and Poppy ran up to the Harriet \"Kate, we will get the juniors out, you take charge of the others\" As the stream of girls passed by Harriet mentally began counting them out as she spoke calmly \"Walk slowly girls, no need to rush. All will be fine. The fire engines are on their way\". When the last girl passed by Harriet nodded to Jane and Charlotte \"You two go to the quad. I will stay here for any stragglers\" Jane gasped and Harriet patted her on the arm \"Go! The girls will need organising on the quad\" Harriet waited alone listening to the sound of sirens. She could smell smoke but all was silent in the hall of Abbey Mount. She had done her duty. She turned and walked slowly to the quad. The quad was in turmoil. Hundreds of girls milling about with none of the teachers in control; Harriet's voice cracked like a whip \"Silence! Girls get into lines. Get into your forms!\" she spotted Mrs Kingsley \"All Juniors are accounted for Mrs Kingsley!\" \"Thank you Harriet!\" Mrs Kingsley began taking the register of the older girls \"Jennifer Logan?\" Silence \"Come on girls has anyone seen Drippy?\" Silence Harriet opened her \"DRIPPY IS IN THE FREEZER!\" the same time as Poppy More. The two girls looked at each other. Poppy ran into the burning kitchen followed by several fire-fighters. The girls surged forward \"Girls! Stay in your lines!\" Harriet's voice rang out. The girls stayed silent as Poppy led a sobbing Drippy out of the kitchen. As Poppy walked by Harriet she looked at Harriet and nodded; Mrs Kingsley patted Harriet on the arm \" Let's get the girls back to bed shall we? Oh and Harriet? I am very proud of you this night!\" Mrs Kingsley stood at the front of the assembly \"The fire was an accident and though the damage was considerable Abbey Mount will continue. I am proud of how we all responded to the fire but I want to commend two girls in particular. Can Harriet Bentley and Poppy More please come up\" Harriet stood up and followed by Poppy joined Mrs Kingsley on the stage \"Harriet you showed leadership in raising the alarm and organising the safe evacuation of the juniors; Poppy you risked your life to save a friend. You are both Abbey Mount girls to be proud of\" The assembled girls began to clap. Poppy moved to face Harriet smiled, put out her hand and said in a clear voice \"When the Head Girl earns my respect then I will shake her hand\" Harriet remembered the words from her first encounter with Poppy. It all seemed so silly now. She put out her hand to meet Poppy's. The handshake turned into an embrace with both girls in tears. Kate stood up to followed by the entire assembly, each girl standing up to clap and cheer the crying Harriet and Poppy, the noise growing in volume. Mrs Kingsley stood back and smiled \"Well, Well\" she whispered.

I can change our trip plans.\" Mr. Moore asked as he loaded Molly's suitcase into the trunk of the taxi. No dad it's fine, I'll be fine. Plus Molly really wants this trip.\" Poppy replied. \"It's only two weeks.\" Mr. Moore closed the trunk and turned to face his oldest daughter, \"I know, I just don't like the idea of leaving you home alone for two weeks.\" \"Dad I'm 18, I've been alone before.\" Poppy replied, \"Plus Kate and Drippy are flying in later this week so I won't really be alone.\" He took her in his arms and gave her a big squeeze before kissing her on the head, \"I'll call you when we land in Pretoria.\" Poppy nodded and kissed her dad's cheek, \"See you in two weeks.\" Smiling he turned to the house, \"Molly it's time to go!\" Molly Moore came running out of the house in a blur of camouflage and blonde hair, \"Sorry i couldn't find my hat. Bye Poppy!\" she hollered over her shoulder as she hopped in the cab and slammed the door behind her. Poppy and Mr. Moore chuckled. He walked to the other side of the cab and opened the door before looking back up at Poppy, \"Two weeks.\" \"Two weeks.\" Poppy confirmed with a wave. Mr. Moore hopped into the taxi and it sped off down the driveway and out of sight. Poppy stood in the Moore's house front foyer. The quietness was a nice change to the usual hustle and bustle of the house. There was no giggling coming from the kitchen where Molly and her friends would sit and have snacks while doing homework after school. The Phone in her father's study remained silent for the first time since she could remember. And her cellphone lay forgotten on the living room table. Her friends in England spending time with their families before flying out in 2 days. \" What to do? What to do?\" Poppy thought to herself as she walked over to the bay window that overlooked their back patio and the California Coastline.. Swimming. It had been far too long since Poppy had last went swimming. She had been meaning to all week but something had always come up. Between calls from Freddie at Harvard, and packing her trunk to ship back to Abbie Mount next week she barely had time to shop with Molly for her trip to Africa. Racing up to her room she headed towards her closet. She had gone shopping the week before with Molly to pick out a new bathing suit for the trip and Molly had pointed out the perfect one for her. Although Poppy had plenty of swimsuits this one she liked the best cause her sister had picked it out for her. When Poppy had suggested Molly get it for herself, Molly had replied with \" I hate pink, plus lets face it your boobs would look better in it than mine.\" So Poppy had bought it for herself and today was the perfect day to break it in. As she entered her Closet she stopped to look at her picture board. A small smiled formed on her face as she took in all the pictures on it. Most were old memories from when she and Molly were children, a few from her years of rebelling against her father. But it was the picture of her and a certain blonde haired English boy that was the cause of her smile. Freddie's smiling face stood out from the rest. He had been the cause of much joy in her life in the last 2 years since she had arrived at Abbie mount, the rest coming from the small group of girls she had grown to love these past 24 months. They were one of the reasons that she would be returning to Abbie Mount come the fall. Even if it meant leaving Freddie behind at Harvard. Mrs. Kingsley had been overjoyed when her only child had gotten Early acceptance to the American Law school. Although Freddie had wanted to turn it down at first because his really dream was to go to Art School, but his mother had compromised and agreed to pay for Art Classes on the side at a local community college. Freddie had expected and was now taking summer classes in preparation for the Fall Semester. Turning back to her closet she closed the door behind her so she could change. Poppy let her fingertips dip into the cool water of the pool as she floated around the pool relaxing in the fading sun. Well she was relaxing till a splash caused her to tip her float and sink into the pool. When she emerged from under the water she nearly coughed out a lung, \"What the hell?\" Wiping her now wet hair out of her face Poppy looked for the culprit only to come face to face with a pair of crystal blue eyes. \"Freddie?\" Poppy asked confused. \"Well that's not the hello I was expecting.\" He laughed grabbing ahold of her waist and pulling her towards him. \"What are you doing here?\" she asked raising her hands up to rest on his naked wet chest. \"Classes let out earlier then I though, and I figured i would visit you before heading back to England.\" He replied before lowering his lips towards hers. Poppy smiled as his lips claimed hers. Her instincts took over and her hands moved from his chest up to his hair and she tangled her fingers into his blonde curls. A moan escaped her lips. Freddie grinned against her lips, glad of the reaction he had gotten from the women he loved. Ever so gently he lowered one of his hands towards her behind before giving it a gentle squeeze. This seemed to snap Poppy from the trance like state Freddie's lips had put her in. Removing her left hand from his curls she pushed against his chest causing him to release her. \"Freddie….\" \"I know sorry.\" He muttered lowering his forehead to hers. \"After last time, and the whole your mom thing I just think we should wait.\" Poppy reminded him. Freddie nodded his head, the water from his hair dripping down into her cheek before falling back into the pool. \"Movie?\" Poppy asked. \"Movie.\" he agreed. Well what do you think of the first chapter. I hope you enjoy it, I just saw this movie last week and absolutely fell in love with it and the characters.

I knew it. I think I'm innocent.\" Jane and Charlotte both together \"We think so, too!\" Harriet leapt from her seat and lunged towards the seated Poppy who stood and faced her \"You're not! You awful bitch! You've turned this school upside down. You've ruined everything! You started it. I only finished what you started!\" Mrs Kingsley felt a terrible sense of shame and anger. This was Abbey Mount's Head Girl, the exemplary pupil who was meant to uphold the values of the school and behave as an example to its pupils. The Head Girl who had just admitted to setting her school on fire and blaming it on an innocent girl to settle a vendetta. Out of spite; Out of jealously; Out of hatred. The Head Girl of Abbey Mount had been exposed as a deceitful megalomaniac. She had appointed Harriet Bentley to the position. She had heard stories of her obnoxious arrogance and overbearing attitude towards the juniors but had discounted them as mere tittle tattle. She had been wrong. Now it was her responsibility now to put that mistake right. \"Harriet? My office, now\" Harriet was whimpering now, all her previous self confidence gone and she turned to face the rows of Abbey Mount pupils. It was over. Sobbing she left the hall. Mrs Kingsley rose from her seat, behind her she saw Poppy being surrounded by her friends. There would be time later to speak to Poppy and to Jane and Charlotte. First she must deal with Harriet. Matron met her outside the hall. \"It has been a long time since the last girl but I know what to do Mrs Kingsley; there will be anger towards her from the other girls.\" \"Yes. Harriet will have no friends now, if she ever did that is\" Mrs Kingsley sighed and smiled sadly \"Speak to Jane and Charlotte and make them aware of what is expected of them. I will speak to them myself later but tell them how proud I am of them for speaking out for Poppy\" \"Aye I will that Mrs Kingsley, I am proud of them myself\" Mrs Kingsley walked on to her office. Outside the door a trembling Harriet was standing against the wall. Mrs Kingsley opened the door and gestured for Harriet to step inside. \"Sit down Harriet\" \"Mrs Kingsley...Please I can explain\" \"I said sit down Harriet!\" \"Harriet...\" Mrs Kingsley sighed \"You knew the values of Abbey Mount; I cannot believe you thought you could get away with this. You lied Harriet! You lied! To me! To the whole school! To the Honour Court! You were prepared risk the safety of every girl in this school by restarting the fire and to see Poppy Moore expelled for it knowing she was innocent and for what? Because she wouldn't shake your hand? Because she wouldn't show you respect? Because she was a better team captain? Was it because my son likes Poppy and not you? You wanted to destroy Poppy Moore but you have only succeeded in destroying yourself. Harriet stood up straight in her chair \"She took it away from me Mrs Kingsley. Everything I had here! That. that...American whore thought she could better me! Me?! I am the Head Girl!\" \"You were the Head Girl of this school Harriet...The expelled have no titles\" Harriet sat back \"Expelled? Please Mrs Kingsley!\" \"Poppy Moore had the character to own up to the fire and to stand before the Honour Court. You were baying for her blood! Jane and Charlotte had the character to speak out when they saw your lies. You could have chosen to play in Poppy's team Harriet after being dropped as Captain but you hadn't the character to do that only the vanity of your own arrogance and pride; Character; Harriet, Character! You have betrayed everything this school stands for and you have betrayed your family. I know how proud your parents are of you and what a blow this will be to them. I will spare them and this school the shame of a police investigation.\" Mrs Kingsley's voice hardened \"Harriet you are expelled from Abbey Mount. Matron will escort you to your room and there you will remain. Jane and Charlotte will stay with you until your parents comes to collect you. You will have no contact with any other pupil. Given the ill feeling from the other girls I would advise you to stay in your room Harriet for your own safety. Now please leave\" Harriet Bentley stood up shaking then composed herself, took the Head Girl badge from the lapel of her blazer and placed it on the desk, she then turned and walked towards the door her back straight and shoulders back. Mrs Kingsley felt a sudden pity for this tall proud girl who she had never truly liked yet had once felt was worthy of being the Head Girl of Abbey Mount School. She had known Harriet since her first day as a First Year at the school. How had she not seen the insecurity under Harriet's intense ambition and competitiveness? Had Harriet failed her or had she failed Harriet? \"Harriet, whatever else you do with your life and I do not doubt you will move on from this...Remember this day and what I said\" Harriet nodded. The door opened and Matron entered. Jane and Charlotte stood behind her. \"Harriet; Come with us please\" she said softly. Harriet followed Matron out of the office with Jane and Charlotte falling in behind her as they had done on so many occasions. The door closed and the footsteps along the corridor died away as Mrs Kingsley held her head in her hands before finally reaching for her phone. SIX YEARS LATER Mrs Kingsley was an early riser and sat drinking tea at her kitchen. She was alone as Freddie and Poppy had left the day before to return to London and then onto Los Angeles. Her thoughts briefly went to how successful Poppy and her friends had become since leaving Abbey Mount. Freddie had grown into a man and his evident happiness with Poppy gladdened Mrs Kingsley's heart. It had worked out well and through Poppy she had got to know her father Gerry as well forming a real friendship. Mrs Kingsley's attention went to the copy of The Times newspaper on the kitchen table. On the front page there was a headline \" Army Lieutenant Killed In Afghanistan \" There was a photograph of a strong featured blond woman in her early 20's standing at attention in the dress uniform of an army officer. Mrs Kingsley gasped. She recognised that face, It was Harriet Bentley; Lieutenant Harriet Bentley of the Royal Engineers killed by a landmine while on patrol according to the article. The article quoted her Commanding Officer \"Lt Harriet Bentley displayed conspicuous gallantly saving the lives of several members of her unit while under fire despite her injuries\" It spoke of bravery, loyalty and character...character Mrs Kingsley's mind went back to her last meeting with Harriet Bentley and her final words to her. Had Harriet listened and had sought to carry that message through her life after Abbey Mount? Somehow she knew that she had. Mrs Kingsley felt tears come to her eyes and she began to pray for the soul of Harriet Bentley; The Fallen Head Girl of Abbey Mount...

If he really thought he was going to get rid of me that easily he could think twice, I am Poppy Moore don't forget and I never go down without a fight! \"I am not leaving until you hear my side of the story\" I say to him, he gives in and says with a sigh, \"Fine tell me.\" I was beyond relief that he was giving me a chance to explain I had to make sure I did not mess this up! \"Listen well at first I was desperate to get out of here because in truth I was homesick,\" I admitted, he looked like he was holding back a slight smile at the memory of the matron's car prank, but as quick as it had come it was gone in a flash. \"All my pranks were obviously not going to the trick so me and my friends,\" I gulped remembering the last time I saw them. \"Decided that in order to get thrown out I had to snog you! So I was up for it because I didn't know you at the time! Then I got to know you and that all changed and I couldn't do it because I was really starting to like you and fall for you, especially when you kissed me,\" I was now blushing and I couldn't stop I couldn't believe I was admitting to him all this! \"You're the only guy Freddie that can make my heart skip a beat, make me blush like a beetroot, go weak at the knees and stumble and mutter because I am nervous.\" I finished and I think I really did look like a tomato and I couldn't look him in the eye anymore because my sudden gush of feelings made me go all jeloid and nervous. \"Poppy I feel the same about you but how can I be sure that you're not lying?\" he said, I was stumped I didn't know how else to prove it and then I had a sudden idea there has to be a mistake in the email there just has to be! Something had to be a mistake! \"Freddie pass me the letter,\" I say to him he passes it over to me and I start scanning it, I look at the date that is right I then look at the wording, there it was the word snog I would never write that to Ruby it's so bloody English! \"Look there!\" I said to Freddie since when would I use the word snog to Ruby! \"Poppy it's one word?\" he said with a sigh, \"I think you should leave.\" He opened the door indicating I should go and as he opened the door in came crashing to a heap on the floor Kate, Drippy, Josie and Kiki, I stared at them stunned, they jumped up to their feet and Drippy exclaims, \"Wait stop!\" Kate adds to mine and Freddie's confused looks, \"I'm sorry but we have been eavesdropping we know the whole story, but listen Freddie she's telling the truth she really didn't write the letter look at your letter,\" he looked, \"Now tell me what time your date was with Poppy?\" Kate continues, Freddie looks up and gasps, \"It was 11,\" he says, \"But this letter was sent at 11.30 when Poppy was with me so it has to be impossible for her to have sent it!\" I was over the moon, I was beyond relief they all believed me, \"We are all so sorry,\" Josie gushed, I just hugged them so hard I think I may have nearly squished them! \"Thank you so much guys you don't know how much this means to me that you believe me!\" I gushed not sounding like my usual self, \"Yes okay no mushy,\" said Kiki. \"Look Poppy we're going to give you some time to talk to each other and we'll meet you in assembly,\" said Kate. They left and closed the door behind them, I turn to Freddie, \"Poppy I'm so sorry for not believing you at first, and all those things you said to me well I feel the same, Poppy Moore would you do me the honour of becoming my girlfriend,\" Freddie asked. I couldn't believe it, I was in a state of shock and he looked worried that my silence meant rejection, \"Look I don't mind if…\" he started but I didn't give him time to finish before I crashed my lips on to his, he smiled against my lips and returned the same amount of force and he pulled away after a few seconds and said, \"I take it that means a yes,\" I just laughed and once again he kissed me, but we were stopped short as Mrs Kingsley walked in and we sprung apart, she didn't say anything but, \"Assembly is about to start, it's show time…\" Please say if you don't like the story and give me feedback! Please your reviews would mean a lot, I have the 2 nd chapter ready but I need to know what the public think!

This is my first proper fanfic apart from a little one-shot I wrote, I may continue it... Check it out! Its called Meeting my match... all five of them! And its a modern day Hunger Games! Wow Long A/N right? Anyway... Enjoy xx Poppy walked up the corridor wearing her not so traditional uniform bumping into Harriet. \"Always make way for the head girl!\" Harriet proclaimed in her superior manor. \"Well by all means your Majesty\", Poppy said in her ever mocking humor. \"Sorry, Harriet\", Kate mumbled pulling Poppy out of the way. The girls continued walking down to the dining hall. \"I don't know why you guys listen to her she has a severe attitude problem that needs to be adjusted\" Poppy explained, matter of factly. \"Because shes the head girl Poppy!\" Kate answered. When they entered the dining hall as Kate and Poppy were walking by Harriet, Freddy and Mrs Kingsley, Harriet ever so slyly tripped Poppy. Much to Harriet's dismay Freddy caught her. \"Watch it there trouble\" He said flashing one of his award winning smiles. \"Um.. Thanks\" Poppy replied, surprising herself when she started to blush. Poppy and Kate walked to their table and ate their lamb stew, as Kiki, Josie and Drippy prodded the girls for information about what Freddy had said. \"So guys guess what the theme for this years formal is\", Began Kiki. \"What?\" asked Drippy. \"cocktail party!\" Kiki exclaimed. \"Alright! How about we go into town Saturday? Get some killer outfits?\" Josie offered. \"Sure\" the girls chorused. \"Guys hurry up and get ready for the lacrosse game! Its the semi-final we need to keep our heads in the game!\" Poppy announced. The girls head out to the pitch and begin to play. \"Pass Drippy! Over here!\" Kate squeals and scores the winning goal finishing the game at a score of 2:1. After the match as the girls are celebrating Freddy goes to go over to Poppy and the girls to congratulate them but stops himself when he gets a text. \"ugh crappy game right? I can't believe Kate scored she is hopeless at lacrosse, Wanna meet me at the gardens to talk about poetry? xoxo Harriet\" Freddy quickly writes back: \"Um Harriet... It was a great game.. Abbey Mount won? You know? Us? And I think Kate is pretty good at lacrosse... And I don't want to meet you at the gardens. Freddy\" Saturday... \"Get your lazy asses up and get ready we have some serious shopping to do!\" Poppy hollered. The girls groaned. Poppy walked over to Drippy and pulled the blankets off her. Drippy grabbed her pillow and and covered her head. Poppy playfully smacked her on the arm. Poppy got ready, wearing her maroon floaty top and a pair of dark shorts. Kate wore her blue polo t-shirt and a pair of denim jeans, Josie wore an orange hoodie and jeans, Kiki wore a green zippy and shorts and Drippy wore a pink one shoulder top and a white skirt. The girls walked down stairs and outside boarding the bus. Suddenly they hear a car racing up behind the bus. The car quickly overtakes. Its Freddy and when he sees Poppy he smiles right at her. All the girls start squealing in delight. When they get of the bus they head to A-wear to get some fancy cocktail dresses. Poppy gets a short, strapless, light baby blue dress that has a very floaty material and a love heart neckline. There are diamonds around the waist area and more around the chest and back. Kate gets a silky plain dress that is rumpled at the bottom and has a black elegant bow around the waist. Drippy gets a short, strapless, purple dress that is very puffy at the bottom and has a sash and diamonds around the waist. Josie gets a lime green dress that has black embroidery down to the waist and a black bow around the waist and Kiki gets an orange one shouldered dress that is fluffy from the waist down and has a sash made from diamonds around the waist. After a hard day shopping the girls go for a bite to eat at an English tavern. Surprise surprise Freddy and a few other guys are there. Drippy sits down at the neighboring table so the rest a forced to join her. \"Hey Freddy\", Kiki calls out. \"Hey Kiki, Poppy, girls.\" Freddy smiles. \"Aren't you gonna introduce us to these gorgeous girls\", One of the guys winks. Freddy chuckles. \"This is Kiki, Kate, Drippy, Josie and of course, the lovely Poppy Moore\" Freddy says motioning to each of us as he says our names. The girls start giggling and the guys start whistling and slapping Freddy on the shoulder. Poppy can't keep a blush from creeping up on her cheeks as she shyly smiles. \"Shut up\" Freddy says smiling, shoving one of the guys half halfheartedly. Everyone just starts laughing. \"Anyway... This is Owen, Jace, Alex and this ladies man is Josh\", Freddy said pointing to the guy who called them gorgeous. \"Hey\" The girls chorused. \"Are you guys going to the dance?\" Jace asked. \"Yeah\" Josie answered for everyone. \"Nice to know\" Alex smiled. After lunch Everyone walked out to the village parking lot, where the guys cars were parked and the girls were to get the bus. Suddenly Poppy remembered. She forgot her dress in the tavern. \"Shit I forgot my dress!\" She blurted out. \"You can't go back! The bus will be here an second!\" Kate warned. \"I have too! Ill be back in time don't worry\", Poppy stated. \"I'll come with you, It's a good bit away and there could be anyone out there\", Freddy offered. \"Sure\", Poppy smiled. \"Guys just go or you wont be back in time for the bus!\" Kiki declared. Freddy and Poppy hurried of to the along the way, telling each other random things about their lives. By the time the got back to the car park, the bus, the girls, and the guys, were gone. \"Well shit.\", Poppy swore. \"Do you wanna lift? We're going the same place anyway.\", Freddy offers. Poppy hesitates. \"I won't bite\" He winks. \"much\". Poppy blushes and gets into the car. \"Whats that pole-thingy?\" Poppy asks much to Freddy's amusement. \"Its called a gear stick, you use it to change gears\", Freddy explains laughing at Poppy's bewilderment. \"Isn't the car meant to do that?\" She questions. \"This is England, not America\" He chuckles. Poppy just smiles. \"So wheres your dad? I never see a Mr Kingsley around Abbey Mount..\" Poppy enquires. \"He died when I was nine\" Freddy admits. \"same\" \"what?\" \"Oh sorry, my mum.. she died when I was eleven\" Freddy doesn't try to say things like 'I'm sorry', or 'It will get easier'... because its not okay, and it doesn't get easier and no one knows that more than him. Besides, Poppy doesn't look like someone who wants pity. The rest of the drive is in silence. Not an awkward silence, but a peaceful one. A/N: Yay! First chapter ;) Anyway, what do you think?

We visited the beach, splashed around in the sea and lounged around the pool. We knew our summer days were almost over but we still carried on like it was our first day. When Freddie had to leave early I knew our lives would change, the others thought differently, but I know Mrs Kingsley wouldn't have called Freddie back early without reason. Things were about to change and not for the better. The first change this year is Mollie Moore attending Abbey Mount, she'll be a few years below us but I intend to bargain with Mrs Kingsley. Me and the girls head back to the rain country a day before term starts, Mollies coming with us too. I just hope nothing's cracked off while I've been away. Tomorrow we head back; I don't want to leave the sun behind so hopefully it will come with us. Poppy's excited to go back, to see Freddie of course. Something about his early departure doesn't seem right, something at Abbey Mount has changed and I don't think we'll like it. Drippy POV Kate's over thinking Freddie leaving, I wish she'd leave the thinking to Kiki. It's not like Freddie leaving means much; Mrs K probably wants her golden boy back in her arms. Knowing Mrs K she's scared of Freddie losing his virginity to Poppy, mothers are just over protecting. To think I may have to introduce my mates to my mum is a nightmare. She'll pull a photo album out and show off my baby photos, not cool. Ugh, the longer I avoid mum the better it will be for me. I must remember to burn those photos on bonfire night. ¡One Day Later! Kate POV Here we are on the plane back to the rain capital of the world, from sunshine and lazy days to rain and books. We're staying at Drippy's house, well I am. Poppy and Mollie are staying at Josie's, she only lives around the corner. Kiki's going home to her parents, she needs to go back to pack. My trunk has already been dropped off at Drippy's so I'm packed. Before I went to Malibu I made a list of the things my mum would need to buy and pack. Kiki didn't think ahead, at least it's only a night. Drippy and Poppy have arranged how we're getting there, why does that scare me a little? I know, I know have some faith in them. Poppy and Drippy are a bad combo. Full of mischief the pair of 'em, gotta love them though. That's the thing with Poppy, she grows on you and then you can't help but love her. Mollie on the other hand is impossible to hate, she could slap you around the face and you'd still love her to pieces. Mollie wouldn't do anything to hurt anyone's feelings; she has a certain charm about her. We're landing soon, we've gotta get a taxi back because we all can't fit in one car and Drippy's and Josie's parents are at work. Kiki's getting picked up by her parents so at least we don't have to worry about her, I'm just worried about us once again Poppy and Drippy have arranged transport. Knowing Poppy it'll be a little over the top, ok it will be well over the top. Poppy POV Kate needs to stress less and trust me and Drippy. It's not like we've arranged a tank to pick us up, we tried to get one but apparently you can't rent them here. We've got something more exciting then a dodgy mini bus, Drippy had the idea for it. Maybe if I told Kate that she'd chill out, I doubt it. The look on her face when she see's it will be priceless, I've gotta remember to have my camera out ready. A new semester in rain-land, the old me would be sulking. Now I'm actually happy to get wet, maybe it'll snow soon. If it does I can see a snow ball fight and me opening a can of whoop ass. \"Kate,\" \"Yes Poppy?\" She yawns, \"Do ya think it'll snow this year?\" \"Might do, if it does it'll only be a slush. By break it would be gone, it's rare we get snow deep enough to cancel lessons.\" Damn, no can of whoop ass needed for the snow, that's a shame. Ah well at least I can use my can in lacrosse, I can smell another victory this year. That and smelly feet, must be the man behind us 'cause it pongs. Mollies coming with us to rain-land, I asked dad to let her come to Abby Mount. Last semester I missed her like I missed the sun and I'm not going through that again. Dad even let her the first time I asked, was he ever that reasonable or was I just a brat? After that I asked for a puppy, to bad dad said no I really fancied a Labra doodle. Now I'm having a nap, this American girl needs her sleep. Drippy POV Kate's gonna have a heart attack when she sees what me and Poppy's arranged. Gonna be funny though, to bad about the tank I fancied going round to Harriet's house and 'accidently' press fire on the rocket button. That reminds me I still haven't told the gang about the mess Harriet got into when she came across some friends of mine. She's got a new fella as well, off the yogurt commercial or summet. Either way she deserves what happened to her. When I said 'Harriet you're going down biatch' I meant it. We're landing in a minute, won't be long till Kate's heart attack. Thank god the emergency services number has the same three numbers, makes it easier to press when you're laughing so hard. Poppy POV \"Wakey, wakey rise and rain!\" Ugh, whoever that is they can get bent, \"Moore, wake up,\" \"Piss off\" I mumble into the seat, they've just interrupted a good dream. Stupid idiot, \"Freddie's here,\" My eye's flick open and a smile explodes on face, they all laugh at me. Using Freddie to wake me are they? That's shallow, \"You aint funny, stupid Brit,\" I mumble, they of all people should know about my needs. Food, drink, sun, Freddie and sleep, not fair. I need my sleep! \"Where are we?\" \"The rainiest place in earth,\" \"We're in Scotland?\" Drippy asks at random, \"Oh no we're on the wrong plane?\" I laugh, her remarks are just priceless. No wonder why she's nicknamed Drippy, \"No Drippy you great drip, England, I wouldn't wanna go to Scotland might come across Matron.\" Josie shudders at the thought; I must remember not to pay Matron to get new clothes this time. I even bought a fake phone this time, matron aint getting her greasy hands on either of my phones. When I got my phones back they were covered in finger marks and smudges, I wasted a week cleaning them off. They're clean now and they're staying that way, even if I have to fight Matron. I strap my self in and wait to touch down in rain-land. Drippy POV Oh yeah! A few more minutes, till the surprise I'm bouncing up and down in my seat with excitement. Josie's next to me and looking at me as if I've completely lost it, Poppy's behind trying not laugh; Kiki's sat in front lecturing Mollie on England and Kate's next to Poppy and staring out the window. Come on, this stupid plane needs to land! ¡One Minute Later! Oh my god it's so slow! ¡30 Seconds Later! My grandma could walk faster then this and she's old! ¡One Minute Later! Bored! When's this tin can gonna land? ¡30 Seconds Later! \"Josie, are we there yet?\" \"No.\" ¡10 Seconds Later! \"How about now?\" \"No.\" ¡10 Seconds Later! \"Oi, Josie\" \"No we are not there yet, be patient.\" ¡One Minute Later! Touch down! Yeah baby! \" Please remain seated.\" For god's sake, I have a surprise to get to! \"Drip, chill out\" Poppy whispers to me, this is torture! Josie POV Drip's gone a lil' coo-coo, she needs to calm down because the stewardess is looking at her funny. You'd think she'd be upset about leaving sunshine city; my conclusion is Drippy has lost it. What am I saying? She never had it to lose! I know what's wrong with her; she's spent too much time in the sun. It's made her go a little coo-coo in the head. I think I've seen the hold up. In unison we all, except Drippy, look at Poppy, \"Why is there a red, open top party bus outside the plane?\" Kate asks, she sounds shocked after all we did trust Poppy and Drippy to arrange this. \"I dunno, ask the pilot. Jeez get off my case,\" Poppy shrugs, she turns away from Kate in an attempt to conceal her growing smirk, \"At least you didn't get a tank,\" \"We tried but the army said tanks aren't available to rent,\" Drippy informs us, \"now can we go because everyone's leaving?\" \"The pilot said to stay sat down so why's everyone getting up?\" Mollie asks, I think Kiki forget to explain about English people's behaviour, \"Because we English are impatient,\" I say, \"Yeah your also loud, you drink a lot of tea, you say funny words like 'rubbish', you moan a lot, you're soccer mad, you play the baddie in every film…\" \"Thank you for summarising English people Poppy, now can we go?\" I beg, \"See! Like I said you moan a lot!\" \"Poppy, Freddie's on the bus.\" Kate said, \"That trick only works once,\" I look out the window, Freddie is actually there sitting on the top of the bus waiting for us. \"Look out the window.\" He's there but he's not smiling his normal smile, some things wrong, \"Why are we still here if Freddie's out there?\" Poppy grabs her bags and sprints off the plane, by looks of things there's disappointment and upset waiting for her. Whatcha think? Yeahh my first fan-fic that isn't full of anarchy and St Trinians. Butt later in the story im tempted to get a lil bit of St Trinians in there, if you thinks its a baaad idea let me no because I'll add it to the list of no no nos. Hm, I dunno if you guys have a fear of reveiwing but: Coughs and sneezes spread diseases while reveiws make writers thank Jesus. That rhymed sorta.

Una suave mano se posó en el brazo de ella, tratando de reconfortarla. La mano de Freddy comenzó a acariciar sutilmente la piel descubierta; fue subiendo poco a poco hasta llegar a su hombro, de ahí la trasladó a su mentón. Con un ligero jalón, movió la cara de Poppy para que lo viera a los ojos. Ella tenía sus ojos rojos, conteniendo las lágrimas; sin embargo, una solitaria lágrima bajó por su mejilla. Freddy movió su mano y la secó cuidadosamente. —No hay razón para llorar, linda —dijo él, convenciéndose a sí mismo también. —Pero… pero… me iré, y yo… te quiero —su voz se quebró en aquel instante —Y yo a ti —contestó él, al tiempo que juntaba su frente con la de ella, tratando de permanecer con ella el mayor tiempo posible. Acercó sus labios a los de ella, temeroso de no volver a sentirse así nunca más. Ella había sido su cura y ahora se iba. Los labios de Freddy se movían suavemente sobre los de Poppy, dulcemente. Sabían a sal, a amor, a cariño, a tristeza. —Moore, adentro —ordenó una severa voz desde el otro lado de la habitación. Poppy tomó la mano de Freddy entre las suyas y la llevó a su corazón, mientras ella descansaba la suya en el corazón de él; los latidos estaba al unísono, como si estuvieran unidos. Le dio un corto y tierno besos, y se paró, dejándolo ahí, conteniendo su tristeza, viendo como aquella chica americana que le había robado el corazón, se iba.

As Poppy ran out of the honour court everyone was shocked that Poppy was expelled, all the girls, expect Harriet of course, didn't expect Poppy to get expelled. Poppy ran straight into Freddie once Poppy realized who she ran into she apologized and got up and walked away. \"Trou-Poppy wait up what's wrong?\" Freddie asked her. Oh why did he have to come running after her, why did he have to nearly call her trouble and make start balling her eyes out. \"There's nothing wrong Freddie just leave me alone.\" \"No Poppy just tell me what happened?\" Why did she have look like one word and she would burst into tears? Why wont she tell me what happened in the honour court. \"I got expelled okay happy now I told you, you can now leave me alone.

Why does she have to leave, as we broke apart for air, I noticed that her eyes were closed. I really don't think that she sent the emails that broke my heart. \"Trouble you didn't send those emails did you?\" As I asked her, her eyes started to open and I could see the love in her hazel eyes. \"No, Freddie I didn't but I do think I know who.\" As Poppy kissed Freddie they heard a voice. \" What is going on here?\" Harriet was furious Poppy and her Freddie were kissing, KISSING in the corridor, \"Fraternizing with the ladies is forbidden, Freddie.\" \"Well I'm in fact not fraternizing Harriet, seeing as she no longer goes to this school.\" Freddie lent down and captured Poppy's lips in a kiss. Harriet screamed \" WHAT ABOUT THOSE EMAILS SHE SENT YOU FREDDIE AND THE STUIPD I HEART LA LIGHTER OF HERS THAT SHE USED TO START THE FIRE WITH.\" \"How do you know about the lighter, Freddie found it before anyone saw it so that means you sent the emails and re-lit the fire?\" Poppy looked happy maybe she won't get expelled, maybe Harriet will slip up and say she lit. \"You little American Trollop, you made me light the fire, if the vermin you are did not come here, Freddie would still be mine.\" As Harriet finished that little speech of hers, Kate, Drippy, Josie and Kiki stepped around a corner with a recorder in Kate's hand. \"Well it looks like we have caught you girls lets go take this recording to Mrs Kingsley.\" Kate and the girls smiled at Poppy and turned around and walked away. \"Oh, Freddie could you stop them for me please?\" Harriet fluttered her eyes at Freddie. \"Oh, but Harriet, did you not notice I helped the girls get the truth from you.\" Freddie bent down to whisper in Poppy's ear \"You are not totally forgiven.\" Freddie turned and walked away ignoring the looks Harriet was throwing at him. Harriet walked away fuming, how dare they help that vermin chuck her out here did they not know how important she was, or how much damage they have caused her. After watching Harriet walk away, Poppy turned to see if Freddie was still around, but the hallway was clear. Poppy started to look around the school for Freddie but she couldn't find him, so she headed to his room hoping he would be there. As she knocked on the door, Freddie opened the door as if he knew that someone was going to turn up to his room. \"Did you want some think Moore?\" Freddie had expected Poppy to turn up at his door, but he expected her to turn up earlier. \"Look you heard what Harriet said, she wrote the emails. I was not even in the computer room when the emails where sent, I was out on our date. Please Freddie believe me, I would never put you through that pain, I...\" She started to say some think but trailed off towards the end. \"I know you did not write the whole email but has you said you wrote some o it and that's the part I can't forgive you for, if I get got fraternizing I will get kicked out of mums school. Poppy I put a lot on the line to take you on that one date, my mum knows what happened because of that letter, and although she will let me take you out without making me move schools I'm not sure I can trust you but, I really like you Trouble.\" Freddie did not want to freak her out to much and tell her the full extent of his feelings. \"Freddie, I do like, I like you a lot and you were my reason to stay and to make things right. At first I got you to like me just to get out of here, but after our date I realized that, I fell for you and that I fell for you hard.\" Freddie couldn't resist her any longer he lent down and started kissing her, happy that he could finally feel the sparks running through his body again from her touch, he liked her bottom lip so as to deepen the kiss Poppy opened her mouth to give entrance to his tongue. He had never kissed her like this before she had tingles all through her body, he was the only one who had ever made her feel like this, like she could tell him everything that was going on with her and that he would just sit there and listen to everything that she said. He broke the kiss for air resting his forehead against hers, \"Trouble, although I'm not sure that I will able to trust for awhile I still want to go out with you, Poppy please be my girlfriend? \"Yes, of course I would I not after all I just said.\" Poppy leaned in and kissed him again still wishing that it could go on forever.

At last she heard a cry… \"It's a boy, princess.\" Bragnae said, lifting a screaming, little bundle up and placing him in Isolde's arms. \"What are you going to name him?\" the nurse wife asked, looking down at the babe. \"I don't know.\" Isolde answered, finally, moving away the cloth to peek at the babies face. He had her big, blue eyes, but as for the hair, she couldn't quite tell. It looked to be a dark brown, but then again, it was too dark to really see clearly. \"Who's your father?\" Isolde asked the baby. \"Is he Tristan, or is he Lord Marke? Shall we ever truly know, my little baby?\" Isolde whispered. The nurse wife came over to take the babe and clean him up, but that was enough… Isolde had made a connection with the wee babe. She knew that even if he wasn't Tristans, even if he was Markes, she would keep him. Until he was old enough to be sent back to Cornwell and claim his place on the throne there. But for now, he was hers and she would take care of him and love him, as much as he needed. Isolde held the babe closer to her for one brief second, before letting him go. She sighed as she watched her little boy be carried away and soon after fell into a deep sleep. Bragnae helped the other woman take care of the babe and clean up the room as much as possible. She thanked the woman and promised to check on the wee one every couple of hours to see that he was all right. When the woman had left, Bragnae rocked the babe to sleep, then placed him in a basket beside Isolde on the bed. She laid down on the other side of the bed and the basket and tried to sleep as best she could. Bragnae was worried about the babe and her mistress, would they truly ever know who the father was? \"Lord, please send some small sign to help ease the princesses heart.\" Bragnae whispered and she closed her eyes.[Chapter 2] Second Chance Tristan awoke on the hard ground, with a strong sense of déjà vu. He lifted up his head and tried to look around. He seemed to be in a hut of some sort, there was an old man bending over a fire. \"Where am I?\" Tristan asked, falling back down onto his make shift bed. The old man turned and walked over to him, \"well, you're not dead as everyone else seems to think. I saved your life, I did.\" he said. Tristan gazed at the man, \"I'm Tristan, son of Aragon.\" Tristan said. The old man chuckled, \"I know that. I'm Aodh, I was sent here to catch the dead and ship them to either heaven or where they need to go. But you, you seem to be always avoiding death. First when Princess Isolde saved you and now when you weren't quite dead.\" Aodh said. Tristan stared at him. \"If I didn't die and I'm not dead. Then where am I? What's going to happen to me?\" Tristan asked. \"Well, when I let you go, after you've been fully healed. I suspect that you'll go searching for Isolde and your child.\" Aodh said. Tristan looked up in shock, \"my…my child and Isolde? I have a child? Is it a boy or a girl?\" Tristan asked. Aodh's eyes lit up, \"it's a wee, little boy.\" he said. \"A boy, I have a son. what's his name?\" Tristan inquired. \"Well, she's yet to name him. Seeing as she's not sure whether he's your son, or Lord Markes.\" Aodh answered. \"I have to find them.\" Tristan said, pushing himself up onto his elbows and struggling to pull himself up. Aodh pushed him back down, \"just wait Tristan, son of Aragon. Let yourself heal first, then you can go looking for them.\" Tristan closed his eyes and remembered a previous conversation with Isolde. A time when she was speaking about the future. Flashback... Isolde was laying beside him on the ground, a blanket covering them both. \"… a child.\" Isolde said. \"Will it be mine or his?\" Tristan whispered, Isolde sat up behind him and rested her head on his shoulder. \"I'd have no way of knowing, would I?\" Isolde asked. In response, Tristan turned to face her and kissed her, pulling her back down to the blanket with him. End of flashback... Tristans dream: \" She's gone, Lord Marke.\" a small man exclaimed, running into the meeting place. \"what do you mean Phelps, who's gone?\" Mark asked. \"Isolde, she's left with Bragnae her maiden, to find a place to raise it.\" Phelps said. Marke looked at the man sharply, \"Raise what?\" he asked, \"why the baby of course.\" Phelps answered. \"Isolde was going to have a baby?\" Lord Marke asked, turning back to the chart, in thought. \"Yes sir, I thought you knew, most everyone else did.\" Mina said. \"Why did no one think to tell me this? I let her go and she could be carrying the heir to my throne!\" Marke shouted. \"We must find her. Send everyone out to look for her. Two women can't run very fast, especially not when one of them is pregnant.\" Marke said. Immediately, several of the men stood up and began talking as they walked out. \" Mina,\" Marke called. \"yes?\" she asked, turning and coming back to him. \"You knew about this didn't you?\" he asked her. \"Yes Milord,\" she said bowing her head. \"Why did you let me let her go?\" he asked. \"She needed it Marke. You could not have missed the tortured look in her eyes ever since Tristan died. She loved him and he gave his life for you. Every time anyone mentioned his name in her presence, she would gaze off in the distance, not hearing, not caring. I couldn't bear to see the beautiful, young girl that way. I was afraid you'd never let her go until the babe was born and keep it if it was a boy. Which would've killed her inside even more, especially if it was Tristans child. Give her some time and wait, she'll come back to you. But push her and she'll never return.\" Mina said and left. Tristan awoke in a cold sweat and got up, he looked around him and saw a small lake. He picked up his clothes off of the ground, where they were folded nicely and placed in a pile. Then he moved over to the lake to bathe himself. The dream had unnerved him, so Marke thought the babe was an heir to his throne. Which means Tristan wouldn't be the only one out there looking for her. A part of Tristan knew that it wasn't a dream, that had actually happened. But who was Mina? How did she know about Isolde being pregnant or about him? After Tristan bathed, he quickly got dressed. Aodh was nowhere in sight, but there was a not saying he was free to go and do as he pleased. Tristan grabbed things that he thought he would need. His sword was wrapped in a cloth and laying by where he had been sleeping these past couple of days. Or was it months, Aodh said time here passed differently than it did in the world.[Chapter 3] My little baby Isolde rolled over in the morning, between herself and Bragnae was a basket where her baby had been placed last night. She peeked into the basket. A curly little head was nestled in the blankets. Isolde reached into the basket and slowly, gently took the baby out. She held the baby close to her, but turned his face out to see him better. The baby had light brown hair, that curled at his temples and her big, blue eyes. But one glance told Isolde that he was Tristans son after all. He had his nose and perfect lips. \"I'll name you Tristan Aragon, my little baby. After your father.\" Isolde said, Tristan Aragon smiled in his sleep, as if he had heard her and liked his name. He turned and nestled his face into his mothers chest and cooed. Isolde looked down at him and a tear slid down her cheek and fell on the baby. Isolde quickly wiped it away. As she was moving her hand away from his sweet face, Tristan grabbed her finger in his little fist and brought it to his mouth. Isolde let him suck her finger for a bit, before feeding him. \"I'll take care of you baby, I won't let anything hurt you ever. \" she said. \"Bragnae,\" Isolde said, waking her up. \"Yes, princess?\" Bragnae asked her. \"I'm going down to the lake to bath. Watch Tristan Aragon for me.\" Isolde said, getting up and gathering her clothes to herself. \"You better hurry up with it, we wouldn't want some man to see you and try something.\" Bragnae said. Isolde sighed, thinking about when Tristan had seen her bathing, back when she kept him at the cottage by the sea. The things that had happened and stuff Bragnae said when she found Tristan with Isolde. Isolde kissed Tristan Aragon on the forehead and left him with Bragnae. \"Heir to the throne of Cornwell.\" Bragnae said, lifting Tristan out of the basket and getting him ready for his bath. \"How he would have been raised differently had he been born in the castle, I'm sure Lord Marke would have treated him as a son.\" she said to herself. She unwrapped the cloth from around the baby and dipped a small washcloth in the water that was being heated above the fire. She laid the babe on their small bed and took his tiny feet in her hands to bathe them. Tristan cooed and Bragnae found herself unable to not fall in love with the little thing. After she had wiped his body down and Isolde had still not come back. She started to go outside to fetch Isolde, but holding a babe in her arms made it hard. She gently laid Tristan on the bed and lined his basket with a new set of clean blankets before placing him back in it. She left the babe and the basket a little ways away from the fire to keep him warm and opened the small door to go find Isolde. Isolde moved outside, leaving her baby with Bragnae, knowing that she would wash him and place him in the basket waiting for his momma to comeback and feed him. But no matter how much she loved her baby, she just couldn't stay in there much longer. Not when he reminded her so much of Tristan. Not when looking at him brought back so many memories, good and bad. Days spent at the cottage by the sea, talking and laughing. Kissing and holding one another, trying not to think about the near future when he would have to go away. She remembered, waiting eagerly for Bragnae to leave so she could cuddle up with Tristan under the covers and listen to him talk about his life. Then she would run back as soon as the sun began to rise, promising Tristan she would be back soon. Just barely making it to the hut before her father would come to check on them or when Morholt was alive and he would come torment her, which he thought was flirting with her. Isolde hadn't been happy that he had died, for she wasn't so cruel to think that. But she wasn't sad that he had died either, she was only sad when they found Tristans boat and she knew that they had only moments left together. Then she had to watch him leave, thinking that she would never see him again. That they would never be able to kiss one another or say that she loved him and he loved her. That was the first time that Isolde's heart broke. Isolde set her undergarments and her dress down on a rock and slowly wadded into the water. Part of her hoped that Tristan was still alive, but another part didn't think that he was. She kept telling people that her heart was telling her he wasn't gone, that he was coming back. But each time, people would shake their heads and tell her that it only felt like that because she didn't want him to be dead. Somewhere, deep down in her heart, Isolde hadn't given up hoping. She let the waves take her out even further into the water and tried to clear her mind. Isolde concentrated on the horizon, watching for a sign, any sign that maybe everything would be okay somehow. She didn't notice when the sun was suddenly high in the sky. She was so concentrated on watching for something, that she didn't notice when the breeze passed by, bringing the faintest smell of a storm. \"Princess, you must hurry up! The babe needs feeding and he's ever so small, he may not make it.\" Bragnae said, Isolde came out of the water and hurriedly got dressed. She ran up the sand slope, to Bragnae, \"Sorry to have frightened you, I was just… just… uh\" Isolde sighed and Bragnae reached over to touch her arm. \"It's okay, princess. But I'm not sure if I should be telling you this.\" she hesitated and Isolde looked over at her. \"The babe is so small, he may not be able to make it.\" Bragnae finished. Isolde suddenly wore an expression of grief and she rushed up to the hut. Bragnae followed and came in to find Isolde sitting on the bed, with the baby wrapped in her arms. Isolde was whispering to him and Bragnae crept closer to hear her. \"Momma's going to take good care of you Tristan Aragon. I'll keep you safe and together we'll travel the world.\" she said. Moving the child to her breast to feed him. Bragnae sighed and took the clothes outside to wash them. Knowing that Tristan was in capable hands and Isolde would stop at nothing to keep him safe. As Bragnae would do for the both of them.[Chapter 4] Hey, sorry my laptop crashed and I'm working on getting everything back.

Chapter one will come soon. Enjoy. :3 \" And everything came crashing down in front of my eyes.\" ***** Freddie; When I first saw her at the social, there was something in the way she moved that caught my attention. She was gorgeous. The way wisps of her hair sometimes strayed in front of her face; I wanted to brush them out of her eyes. The way the left corner of her mouth would pull up into a smirk; I immediately was grinning like a fool. The way her eyes sparkled when they reflected the strobe lights; I wanted to look into her soul forever. She was absolutely perfect. I wanted to tell her, needed to tell her. I bit back my words, afraid of coming on too strong. But right now, I wish I could tell her that a million times over, let her know how I feel about her. And I did. But nothing could make the situation right. There was nothing I could do to comfort the girl I loved. I felt helpless. I was useless.[Chapter 2] :D Just a set up. Getting into everything later on. Enjoy. ^^ Dear Diary, I'm dead. Poppy. She slammed the diary shut, shoving it under her mattress. She lay on her back now, facing the blank white ceiling. She obviously wasn't physically dead, but she was dead on the inside. Her fists clenched and unclenched around her bed sheets, her jaw set with tension. She was done crying. She would not cry today. She would not give into the grief that constantly surrounded her for the past three days. Poppy took a few deep breaths, eyelids closed, to calm her sorrow-turned-rage. It was nobody's fault. She couldn't blame anyone for what had happened. And so she sat up, got out of bed, and dressed stiffly. She slipped on a simple black dress that fell just under her knees with a pair of matching high heels. She left her hair down and wore no makeup, bare for the occasion. She slipped on her shoes and stood in the entrance of her doorway. She looked down the hallway to the very end where her little sister was, standing inside her bedroom doorframe as well. Molly looked like a younger version of Poppy. Shoulder-length brown hair, a short-sleeved black lace shirt over a black undershirt, cropped pants, a pair of charcoal flats, and a delicate face filled with agony. She was done crying, too. She was determined to stay strong for Poppy. They met each other halfway, taking each other's hand and walking down the stairs together, prepared to face their father's funeral head on. ***** The funeral was a quiet service. Poppy's father was a very loving man who gave respect and earned respect in return. This was why the room was crowded with many faces that were now familiar to Poppy and her sister. Rosemary, their father's girlfriend, stood crying over his casket. Poppy's teeth clenched at the sight of her. Poppy tried to tolerate her as much as possible when she saw her but she still thought of her as a trashy gold digger. Luckily, Poppy's father split all his possessions between Poppy and Molly, leaving nothing left for Rosemary. She's probably crying over the fact that she didn't end up getting anything , Poppy thought. Sucks for her . Poppy let the bitter taste wash out of her mouth when she sipped on a glass of water. She looked at the open casket at the other side of the room solemnly. Rosemary was escorted away by Poppy's grandmother now. She was afraid that Rosemary would get tearstains on his suit. Molly was now standing over the casket, her small mouth moving slightly, whispering. It was just like Molly. She always said what she was feeling, whether someone was listening or not. She glanced to the opposite corner, feeling tension radiating from there. Freddie stood with his arms at his sides, his mother, head mistress of Abbey Mount, standing by him. Freddie stared at Poppy with eyes so ocean blue and fathomless that Poppy could swear that she saw his soul. Poppy grimaced at the sight of him. She wasn't unhappy to see him. She just didn't want him to see her this way: so unmoving, so bottled up inside of herself. Poppy placed the nearly full glass on top of the nearest table. She turned around and walked out the door, heading towards the bathroom. She turned into a long corridor that directed her towards the women's restroom. The tanned wall corridor stretch out in front of Poppy, the tiles on the floor elongating before her. She walked, nonetheless, hoping to get away from the crowded and suffocating walls. She heard clicking footsteps behind her but she didn't bother to turn around. She already knew. Her footsteps echoed around her with the ones behind her. They were in harmony, the sounds weaving in and out of each other. Like a childhood tune you might hear every night before you went to sleep. Poppy stopped in front of the blank women's restroom door. She faced it but didn't go in. The other footsteps stopped as well. Poppy bit her bottom lip, catching a glimpse of him out of the corner of her eye. \"Poppy,\" Freddie said quietly, almost like a whisper taken by the wind. But she didn't hear Freddie's soothing voice she hoped for. She heard her father speak to her. And this broke her. ","Summary":" Short and sweet. Chapter one will come soon.

Kate, Julie, Kiki, and Drippy arrived to late to say or help Poppy. They just arrived when Mrs. Kingsley said those fateful words. Almost all the girls looked dejected as one of the girls who brought fun into the school was being expelled. The look on Harriet's face was so smug it was a surprise that no one looked at her funny, or even asked her why she was so smug. Harriet hadn't said anything about the I 3 LA lighter, so no one even thought she was the one who started the fire. The look on Poppy's face was a mixture of shock and complete dejectedness. The honor court filed out of the hall almost completely quiet. There was the occasional rustling of clothing and the scrape of chair. Poppy just sat there in shock, there were silent tears running down her face. Mrs. Kingsley came up to Poppy after everybody had left. \"Poppy, I'm very sorry that this had to happen, but you know I had no other choice.\" Mrs. Kingsley said. \"I know. But I didn't do this, you know that!\" Poppy cried out in despair, \"I'm just going to start packing.\" Poppy leaves the hall slowly. As soon she was out of the hall, she started running. She ran smack into something with a hard chest and fell flat on her bum. \"Hey. Are you okay? I saw you run out of there.\" Freddie asked concerned, who was the person she ran into. \" I just got expelled. I'll have to go back to California.\" Poppy said sadly. Freddie picked her up and hugged her to his chest. His chest was warm and hard, and oddly comforting. \"I'm sorry. I know you didn't do this. We'll all miss you, 'specially me!\" Freddie replied. He could feel his shirt getting wet from her tears, holding her tighter. He laid his head on top of hers, matching his breath with hers. There was a loud cough behind them; they slowly turned reluctant to let go of each other. \"You're not supposed to fraternize with the girls, Freddie.\" Harriet snarled, glaring daggers at Poppy. \"I got to go anyway, to go pack.\" Poppy said, answering the question Freddie was about to ask. She slowly trudged up to her room. Freddie left after her, not wanting to be caught by Harriet, especially in a deserted hallway. Harriet was fuming. How dare Freddie still like that American. He loved her, Harriet! The plan was everybody was suppose to hate her for those e-mails, and Poppy would get expelled. Well, Poppy did get expelled and now Harriet could have Freddie all to herself.[Chapter 2] The car came to pick her up. There was no dad in the backseat waiting for her. It was irritatingly sunny when she was waiting for the car. Her friends were waiting with her, as was Freddy and much of the rest of the school. Apparently she became some sort of idol after she got expelled. In fact many of the girls from her year cut class and came out to wait for her, as well as some teachers. \"Sorry guys. My ride is here.\" Poppy said mournfully. She and Freddy locked eyes. Poppy decided that since this was the last time she would probably be ever coming back, she was going to make it memorable. She walked up to Freddy quickly, and grabbed his face. Their lips smashed together at the same time, as Freddy got the hint of what she was doing. The kiss was hot, and filled with desperateness that only being away for an indefinite amount of time could achieve. That kiss was becoming more and more passionate the longer it went on. They both forgot that they had an audience. Freddie's tongue swept across Poppy' lips, asking for permission. The passion went higher and higher as their tongues battled for dominance. As the car driver beeped his horn, Poppy was startled out of her passion-induced dazed. Poppy's face was flushed with embarrassment, as was Freddie's. Poppy's friends were looking at them with laughter showing in their eyes, and were holding back laughter. Many teachers couldn't believe this was happening and Freddie knew he could get a talking to when they were alone. He wasn't suppose to frantizie with the girls. \"Bye\" Poppy whispered to Freddie when she gave him a hug. \"Bye, sweetie\" Freddie whispered back. It was the first time he used that pet name. \"You have my number?\" Poppy asked \"You know it.\" Freddie replied with a cocky grin. Poppy walked over the girls, hugging them hard. \"What no kiss for us?\" Kate asked cheekily. \"I would… but I don't think Freddie would like it\" Poppy replied just as cheekily. Suddenly 4ever by the veronicas started playing. Poppy dug through her bag, searching for her phone. It was Poppy's sister, Maddie. \"When are you getting here? The car should have picked out up by now, and your going to miss your flight if you dont get to the airport in, like, an hour!\" Maddie said in a rush. \"Relax Maddie. I just got...caught up leaving school. I'm leaving now!\" Poppy replyed. \"AWWWW. was it your boyfriend?\"Maddie said in a babish voice. \"Yes it was, actually. now bye.\" Poppy shut the phone. \"I gotta get going, guys. Bye. I love you!\" Poppy said to her girl friends. She gave Freddie one last kiss, and hopped into the car. As the car was driving away, you could see Poppy waving. \"God, I'm gunna miss her.\" Julie muttered. \"So am I\" Freddie responded having heard her. Julie smiled at him, knowing there was more beneath him than just a pretty face. She, and all the other girls, quickly got over their crush on him as soon as they found out he liked Poppy back. Harriet was fuming! Dare they flaunt their \"relationship\" in front of everybody. She highly doubted that Poppy even liked Freddie, and that Poppy was just using him for getting out of there. And now that Poppy got her wish she was acting all sad because she had to leave. \"Freddie. Now that that obnoxious American is gone, things can go back to normal.\" Harriet tried to say seductively, as she clinged to Freddie's arm. Freddie looked disgusted. \"Let go of my arm.\" Freddie growled out, mad that she started flirting obviously with him as soon as Poppy left. Julie and Kate noticed and quickly walked over. \"Hey, you okay Freddie?\" Julie asked happily, she was reveling in Freddie's discomfort. It wasn't in a mean way, it was a we've-gotten-close-so-I-can-make-fun-of-you way. Harriet looked arrogantly down at the girls. \"I'm glad Poppy's gone. Now things are going back to normal.\" Freddie's phone rang right as she said that. Britney Spears started singing \"too high can't come down, losing my head going round and round.\" \"You have Toxic as your ringtone?\" Kate asked holding back laughter \"I didn't change that. Poppy must have when she stole my phone.\" Freddie's ears started turning red. \"Hello\" He answered. \"I'll be right there. I know. I'm coming.\" He relpiled to something \"That was Poppy. Her car broke down, I'm going to pick her up.\" and with that Freddie walked off to get his car. Kate and Julie stood there in an awkward silence with Harriet. Not being able to stand that, they walked back to Kiki and Drippy. Poppy almost yelled with joy, she could see Freddie's gorgeous car pulling around the corner. \"Trouble, how do you always get into these things?\" Freddie asked as he pulled up. \"I don't know. it must be a talent.\" she said looking at him from the corner of her eye. \"Just get in. I'm sure some one at the school knows I'm gone by now.\" replied Freddie, \"Oh, and I need to thank you for my wonderful ringtone\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: i don't own Wild Child, or Freddie, or the actor who plays Freddie. i wish \"Poppy Moor"},{"Movie":"Rock of Ages","Title":"Father and Daughter","Author":"TeekayStaples","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727993","Passage":"[Chapter 1] So, It was pretty late when I dreamed this up, and I wasn't intending on finishing it.

Drew and Sherrie had announced their engagement three hours before, and would be married next summer. After the general celebrations among staff, and Arsenal band members had concluded, Lonny and Dennis had retreated to the office to wind down with a bottle of Jack Daniel's. \"Who'd have thought, ay Den? A small town girl from Tulsa, now a rock sensation, about to get married. And she only showed up in LA a year ago! Bloody amazing.\" Dennis frowned and considered this, \"I didn't know she was from Tulsa.\" Lonny nodded. \"Born and raised. She and I were talking about it the other night. Her mum died when she was a little kid, and she never knew her dad. Her mum says he was some rocker type from LA. Avid description eh?\" Dennis nodded absentmindedly. \"Sherrie Christian… She's in her mid-twenties isn't she?\" Lonny shrugged and took another sip of whiskey, \"There abouts. You alright mate? You've come over all pale.\" \"I'm fine.\" Dennis mumbled, although he didn't feel fine, \"You wouldn't happen to know her mother's name by any chance would you?\" Lonny frowned, considering this. Dennis usually adored Lonny when he looked like he was concentrating, but for the moment he didn't notice. \"Judy, or Julie. Something like that. You sure you're alright Den? You look bloody awful.\" Dennis forced a smile, \"Could you see if Sherrie's still around? I need to speak with her.\" Lonny nodded, got up, looked at Dennis worriedly, and left. Sherrie and Drew were both downstairs, cleaning. Sherrie was wiping down the bar while Drew mopped the floor. ' Good kids, they are.' Lonny thought, 'Bloody hard workers, the both of them.' \"Oi! Sherrie! Den wants a word. Seems important.\" \"Oh, um. Ok.\" Sherrie replied. She looked at Drew, shrugged, and followed Lonny up to the office, cleaning cloth still in hand. Dennis was sitting behind the desk in the office, and he smiled nervously when Sherrie and Lonny walked in. \"Have a seat Sherrie.\" He nodded towards the chair in front of his desk. Lonny moved to lean against the doorframe, and Dennis looked up at him, \"Lonny. Could you wait outside for a minute? I need to speak to Sherrie in private.\" Lonny nodded slowly, and left the office chewing on his upper lip. \"Is everything alright?\" Sherrie questioned. Dennis ignored the question. \"Sherrie, there are some questions I need to ask.\" Sherrie frowned for a second, and then nodded, \"Shoot.\" \"How old are you?\" \"Twenty six.\" Sherrie replied, \"I'm pretty sure it's on my resume.\" Dennis didn't seem to hear the last part, \"And you're from Tulsa?\" \"Uh huh.\" \"Your mother's name?\" \"Julie. Julie Christian. Why? What's this about?\" Dennis sighed audibly and buried his face in his hands. Sherrie looked worried. \"Dennis? What's wrong?\" \"Back in 1960, our band was driving all over America, trying to get gigs, and get publicity. When we stopped through Tulsa, I met a girl named Julie Christian. She was tall, blonde, and had a birthmark on her right shoulder.\" Sherrie's eyes widened, \"That's my mother.\" Dennis nodded, \"She travelled with us for a while, and I was madly in love with her. After about three, maybe four months on the road, she told me she was pregnant, and that she needed a man with a steady job. We dropped her off at the nearest town, although I begged her to stay with me, and I never saw her again.\" Sherrie stared at him for what seemed like an eternity, \"Are you trying to tell me-\" \"I think I'm your father.\" Sherrie left the office briefly to retrieve Lonny. H was sitting just outside the office door, smoking a cigarette. \"I thought you gave up.\" He shrugged, got up, and smiled at her, \"So did I, love. Is everything alright? You look as pale as anything.\" \"Dennis and I need to talk to you for a second.\" \"What's up?\" He asked, sticking his hands in his pockets. She took him by the hand and led him into the office. \"Alright Den?\" Lonny asked. He looked a little better. \"Lonny, Sherrie and I have something to tell you.\" \"Oh Christ, don't tell me. You and Sherrie are having an affair.\" He joked. Dennis and Sherrie flinched. \"Definitely, not.\" Sherrie replied. Lonny raised his eyebrows and crossed his arms. \"Well?

The blood drained from his face almost instantly. \"Lonny, you ok?\" Lonny nodded slowly, \"Yep. Fine. I'm…. nope.\" He fell over backwards. Dennis stood up. \"Lonny? Are you alright?\" Lonny laughed, \"You two are bloody hilarious!\" \"Lonny,\" Dennis said softly, \"We're not messing around.\" Lonny sat up and looked at them. \"Y-you're serious?\" He asked.

In the last two months, I have sat down to do interviews with several people including the remaining members of Arsenal; Sherrie Christian and Drew Boley, the lead singers of the up-and-coming band Von Colt; Dennis Dupree, the owner of the Bourbon Room; Lonnie Russell, the music coordinator and manager at the Bourbon Room; and Stacee Jaxx himself. Most of these names are known to you and have been inspirations to us all for many years. However, I feel the need to explain why I also interviewed Von Colt. Sherrie and Drew have both met Paul Gill, Stacee Jaxx's ex-manager. In fact, Mr. Gill was Drew's manager for just over a month. Several of you might've heard of Mr. Gill… and now all of you will know who he is and what he has done. Twenty years ago, a man named Paul Gill walked into the Bourbon Room and offered a record deal to a twenty-three year old bouncer named Steven Jackson. Steven Jackson and his band had opened for The Bad Omens and were signed on the spot. Less than one year later, Stacee Jaxx and Arsenal took the stage at the Bourbon Room for the first time. Since then, they have sold out every concert they played. Their biggest single came out eight years ago and sold over 100 million albums. Since then, they have been accused of selling out, they have been late for concerts if they appeared at all, and they have made a lot of people angry with the fees they were charging. Eight years ago, Paul Gill convinced Stacee to sign a new contract… one that gave him complete control of the band… and its funds. Since that time, Mr. Gill has kept almost 60% of the band's profits for himself, leaving barely 7% for each band member. He has been plying the singer with alcohol and women, distracting him every time a member of Arsenal tried to speak to him. As you all know, Arsenal quit a few months ago. They did this because Mr. Gill had cut their salary down to 3% of the profits instead of the 12% they usually made… a trend that continued when he signed a new artist. On the night of their last concert, Wolfgang Von Colt opened for Arsenal. Paul Gill waited for the right moment and then pounced on Drew Boley, using every manipulative trick in the book to get the young man to sign a contract. Within a week, Wolfgang Von Colt was disbanded, and Drew learned just what working for Paul Gill was like. \"It was a nightmare. He hated every song we had, even the one we played that night at the Bourbon Room. Every time I tried to do something he didn't like, he handed me alcohol and tried to keep me from thinking about whatever it was I had wanted,\" Drew told me. \"Every gift he gave me was alcohol,\" Stacee told me, completely sober for the first time in years. \"He used it to make sure I couldn't see the world around me and to make sure I didn't realize how much money I was supposed to be getting.\" When I asked Stacee Jaxx about what had happened to the money at the Bourbon Room three months ago, he told me that he didn't find out about it until after my first article had been published. He also stated that he fired Mr. Gill on the spot. Dennis Dupree and Lonnie Russell told me that they had only spoken to Stacee once that night before the concert, and that he had left as soon as it was over. They told me that Paul Gill had come to their office and took all of the proceeds, despite having told them that they would keep 100% of the money. Then, they explained something that Stacee hadn't told me… they told me that Stacee Jaxx sent his bodyguards to the Bourbon Room with a bag full of money… more money than they would've earned from the original concert with a note that read \"I owe you this. Your rock brother, Stacee.\" This is hardly the action of the man who had stolen the money from the Bourbon Room in the first place. After I heard all of this, I did some digging. Right now, Paul Gill owes Stacee Jaxx and Arsenal roughly $100 million just from sales from their last album. He also owes eight different artists, including Drew from Von Colt, an estimated total of $200 million. I say that we have found the true person behind the decline of Stacee Jaxx, Arsenal, and the Bourbon Room. I urge anyone who has worked with him to take a look at anything he has done for you… the problems he has caused might be a lot bigger than this. This story does have a happy ending now. I am pleased to announce that Stacee Jaxx has bought Von Colt's contract from the studio. Von Colt's first album will come out in a few months, and they will be touring with Stacee Jaxx… and Arsenal. That's right, Stacee has reunited with Arsenal and has promised them that he would stay sober this time and has signed a contract to that effect. Their touring schedule will be released soon, but I will tell you this: Their first concert will be held at the Bourbon Room. Stacee also told me to include something personal in this… he is engaged as of last week. It is the hope of everyone who knows him that his fiancé will keep him out of trouble while he tries to get his life back together, and she seems to be doing a decent job so far. She hopes that all of the women at his concerts will learn to keep their hands to themselves but knows it will probably never happen. To everyone involved in this, I really hope the truth is revealed, Constance Sack Putting down the magazine, Sherrie grinned, \"You definitely have a way with words, Constance. You made Gill sound like the rock boogeyman, here solely to destroy bands and rob everyone blind.\" \"It's true though. He tried his best to take everything Stacee had while still making himself smell like roses, and you know he would've done the same to Drew if he'd had the chance.\" \"Right, it all turned out okay though. Come on, let's go show the boys. They need to see this,\" Sherrie told her friend, holding the magazine. Constance smiled as the two of them walked out of her apartment. She couldn't wait to see Stacee's reaction… and to the news she had received this morning. After all, this was going to be his first child.

It was always early in the morning, after the Bourbon had long since closed and Dennis was presumably asleep that Lonny would fee his absolute happiest. His hangover would not have fully settled in yet, and he still had a little bit of alcohol pumping through his system. Dennis was there and although he was asleep, his arms would tighten around Lonny a little when the brunette nuzzled into his side. And before Lonny drifted off to face his inevitable hangover, that he would stare at Dennis and wonder what he did to be so lucky. And he would smile smugly, because Dennis was his, and he didn't have to share him with anyone else. And so he would fall asleep smiling, with his head rested on Dennis' chest. Every night, Dennis would lay there, wide awake, while Lonny got himself comfortable. A ritual which often took hours. But Dennis waited patiently, smirking when Lonny shifted a little or nuzzled into Dennis' chest a little more, until Lonny was asleep (and he could always tell, because Lonny snored ever so slightly) before opening his eyes. He would smile, brush the hair out of Lonny's eyes, and wonder how he ever got to be so lucky. And Lonny would always move to bury his head in Dennis' shoulder, and mumble the older man's name in his sleep, which always made Dennis smile.

New clothes, new hair…new music… Some would argue that these changes were good, even worthwhile. But there were those who suffered. Stacee and Wolfgang von colt were pushed out of musical stardom in favour of pop icons that never even performed live, and while the Bourbon tried to keep their heads above water, they had to admit defeat in the end. Stacee and Constance moved to Hawaii and revelled in their millions. Drew and Sherrie had made enough to live comfortably in LA, and started a family. And as for Lonny and Dennis… They tried to move with the times, and opened their doors to hundreds of Grunge bands scattered across Los Angeles, but no one big came to call. Those who were good got record deals and moved on with their careers, often forgetting about the venue that gave them their name. Soon, it seemed the Bourbon was paying out more money than it was putting in. Then the arguing started. Lonny refused to accept that their days in the sun were over, and insisted they keep the doors open. Dennis however, was done. He was too old, too cynical, and far too broke to keep the place afloat. After a screaming argument, Dennis ultimately decided to sell the place. And in the process, he realised that this wouldn't just end their jobs. They loved each other, but there was no way for them to keep their relationship going outside the Bourbon. It just wasn't possible. Lonny was young and could still make something of his life. Dennis would only hold him back. Lonny refused to speak to Dennis for days. A for sale sign went up outside, and people kept on calling to make offers, although nobody met the price Dennis was hoping for. Dennis tried to put off the inevitable, but knew it would be cruel to draw it out. One night, as Lonny sat in the office in stony silence, watching the Television, Dennis came in and sat down in front of him. \"Lonny. We need to talk.\" \"Not now. Watching telly.\" \"This is important.\" \"Not talking to you.\" \"LONNY WOULD YOU JUST-\" He paused and composed himself, \"Would you please just listen.\" Lonny looked at him, \"What.\" Dennis sighed, \"I…I don't think we should see each other anymore.\" \"….What?\" \"It's just… it doesn't work anymore.\" Lonny stared at him for a moment. It seemed like an eternity. After a while he stood up and burst out laughing, \"Oh Den! That is gold. You really had me worried there. I don't think we should see each other anymore. You know sometimes you really are too much. I –\" Dennis looked away sadly. Lonny swallowed. \"You…I mean. You were kidding, weren't you?\" Dennis shook his head, \"But...we said that we'd always…\" \"I know.\" \"You promised!\" \"I know.\" \"You said this was forever, Den!\" \"I KNOW! For god's sake, I know!\" \"Then why!\" he stood up and began to pace around the room. \"BECAUSE IT'S NOT PRACTICAL!\" He shouted. He was tired of arguing. It wasn't supposed to be like this. All of this was a horrible, horrible mess. \"NOT PRACTICAL?\" Lonny rolled his eyes, \"Bloody hell Den! LIFE isn't practical! That doesn't mean you jump off a building or hang yourself from the bloody ceiling!\" \"Lonny it just isn't going to work! You know it, I know it. Just accept it okay?\" \"I love you…\" \"That doesn't change anything.\" \"So what then? What am I supposed to do?\" He was starting to cry, \"Shall I agree with you, then? Am I supposed to tell you how right you are, pack up all my things, and never see you again? Is that it?\" Dennis said nothing, \"Oh don't worry mate. I'll just carry on with things. I'll just go through the rest of my life without ever hearing your voice, or holding your hand, or sleeping beside you. That's perfectly reasonable.\" \"It's for the best.\" \"No it isn't. It's not for the best. It's just easier. That's it, isn't it?\" \"Lonny please…\" Lonny slumped back onto the couch, \"I don't even remember which things are mine and which are yours…\" They sat there for a while. Lonny on the couch, Dennis at his feet with his back against the chair. They didn't speak for a long time. \"Where will you go?\" Dennis said softly. \"Back home, I spose.\" Lonny replied, \"Live with my parents for a bit. Maybe get a job in a shop.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"So am I.\" \"It doesn't mean I don't love you.\" Dennis said. \"No. I know.\" \"It doesn't have to end straight away. But once we need to leave…\" \"Yeah. Got it.\" \"I think you knew this was coming.\" \"Yeah, I guess I did.\" He said as he stood up, \"God, I hate it when you're right.\" Lonny lifted another box into the back of the van. He sighed, stretched to relieve his aching joints, and went back inside for more things. \"Where does this go?\" Sherrie asked. She was holding up a large box marked \"Playboy: 79'-85'\" \"That's mine.\" Lonny replied, \"But you might as well bin it.\" \"Sure?\" \"Positive.\" Sherrie and Drew had come to help pack up. Today, Lonny and Dennis would move out the last of their things, and hand the keys over to the new owners. They were apparently having a lot of it demolished, and would remodel it into some kind of restaurant. The van was nearly full. The same went for Dennis's car. \"I've got everything I want.\" He said, \"The new owners can handle the rest.\" The Bourbon went for half its original asking price. The cash was split evenly between Lonny and Dennis. With everything packed, the two stood outside the club that had been their home for nearly two decades, and their love nest for just over four years. \"I guess that's it then.\" Dennis said. Lonny nodded. \"I spose so.\" Dennis pulled him in for a hug. \"I'll miss you.\" \"I wrote my parent's number down. Just in case.\" He slipped a dollar bill with numbers scrawled on it into the pocket of Dennis's jeans. \"If you're ever in town again…\" Dennis ventured. \"I'll look you up.\" \"If you're not too busy.\" \"I won't be.\" They let go of each other and Dennis got into his car. Lonny offered him a small wave. \"All good things must come to an end.\" He muttered, before he got into the van he'd hired and drove away. It was late. Way after midnight. He wasn't sure what time it would be over there. It had been two weeks since the move, and Dennis was tired and heartbroken. He was staying in a hotel until he found an apartment, which was difficult given that his price range was so small. He'd got a job as a music producer, of all things. He worked in a little recording studio, and helped acne ridden, angsty teenagers find their sound. It was a good job, but he missed the Bourbon. He missed his office, and his bar. And most of all he missed his Lonny. Should he call? Would Lonny even answer? He was a bundle of nerves. What made him think that Lonny would still want to speak to him. Lonny was probably with someone else now. Someone his own age who treated him nicely and would never hurt him the way Dennis had. But still, with a shaky hand, he dialled the number Lonny had given him and waited. \"Hullo?\" Lonny said. He sounded hung over. \"Hey.\" \"Dennis? Is that you?\" He was sitting on a mattress in his parent's living room. They weren't overly happy about his presence, but he seemed determined to make something of himself, so they were lenient... for now. They were even turning a blind eye to his drinking. \"Yeah, it's me. Got a minute?\" \"Yeah! Yeah, definitely.\" \"How are you?\" \"I'm alright. Got a job. In a clothing shop. I work the afternoon shift, which is quite good. Employee discounts are great. You?\" \"I'm a music producer.\" \"You're shitting me. How'd you get a job like that so fast?\" \"Connections.\" \"Course.\" He paused, \"I miss you a bit, you know.\" \"Yeah. I miss you too.\" They were quiet for a bit, racking up a sizable bill that neither of them could afford. \"You know.\" Dennis said, \"I've got a lot of work here.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah. I could really use an assistant. You know, like a manager?\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah. Do you know anyone who might be interested?\" \"Well… I've got a mate who might be willing. Tall, handsome, good ear for music.\" \"Really? How soon could he be over here?\" \"Two days, I reckon. He's got a job in a shop, and it's a bit shit.\" \"I thought you said your job was good.\" Dennis said suddenly. \"Stay in character, Den.\" \"Right, sorry. Well, if he can make it out here by the end of the week, I'll hire him.\" \"Alright. He'll see you soon.\" Lonny said, smiling, \"I love you.\" \"I love you too. I'm sorry about…about everything I guess.\" \"Don't worry about it.\" Lonny said, \"See you in a bit then.\" Dennis laughed, \"I guess so.\" Yes, all good things must come to an end. But, that doesn't mean the end can't be postponed. Dennis and Lonny lived out a large portion of the rest of their lives together. And when their producing careers went under, they had a new job to try out. And another. And another. And another…. ••• Thank you for reading what is most likely my last Rock of Ages fanfiction. I know, I know. It's the end of an era. I know I've been away for a long time, but I felt those who have been following me since the beginning deserved an explanation. I really want to start focusing on more of my original work. I love and everything it's helped me to do, but I want more out of writing. For those of you who are interested in my independent work, I'd like to direct you to two places; My fictionpress account under the same name, and my Wattpad account under the name of Pinkducklingwasteland. In the future I'd love a website and of course, published works, but those of you who wish to keep in touch with me, or at least with my work, can find me in these places. I'll still be around on . I'd like to try my hand at fanfiction for a few games I've been playing recently, but obviously I won't be posting as much as I did in the glory days. I want to thank you all so much, for reading and reviewing and watching me grow as a writer. I'll still be reading, I'll still be writing in one form or another, and my Beta profile is still open, although it never got that much work to begin with. Thanks again, and I hope you enjoyed.

Drew ran a hand through his hair. He was clearly in a hotel room, but he honestly couldn't remember how he got there. He rolled over, and his eyes widened when he saw Lonny. \"Lonny?\" \"Drew?\" They both sat up and moved away from each other. \"We- we didn't… oh god, did we?\" \"I dunno.

It was the morning after the horrible Z-Guyeez concert, and Lonny had spent the night. The brunette was half asleep, awake enough to smile slightly when Dennis brushed the hair out of Lonny's eyes. Dennis smiled back. He could hardly believe it. Lonny Barnett, Dennis' best friend, and the man he had loved for about five years, was asleep next to him. Now he had only one problem. He was terrified that Lonny would leave. This wasn't a given, of course. But Lonny had never settled down. That could possibly have been because of his secret love for Dennis, but maybe it was just Lonny. Dennis was too scared to ask, in case Lonny saw this as nothing more than a one night stand. \"You awake?\" Lonny asked after a moment. \"Yeah.\" \"That was, quite possibly the best night of my life.\" Lonny muttered. Dennis chuckled. \"Mine too.\" Lonny grinned, eyes still closed, and kissed the back of Dennis' hand. \"So, was I better than Stacee Jaxx?\" Dennis teased. \"Much, much better than Stacee Jaxx.\" Lonny replied with a yawn. \"Better than Beth?\" \"Who?\" \"The barmaid that left.\" \"Oh, yeah. Definitely much better than her.\" \"Was I better than Joey Primo?\" Lonny frowned, still refusing to open his eyes, \"Well…\" \"What?\" Dennis asked, He sat up suddenly, and Lonny's arm slid off him with a thud.

The thick taste of scotch still lingered in his dry mouth. He let out a weak groan, turned over and buried his face in his pillow, as if it would somehow sooth his throbbing head. However, he quickly grew tired of his new position and rolled back to face the ceiling, throwing his arm over his face like a wet rag. He resented the long night ahead.

Sometimes he'd find himself staying up until the alarm clock rang, wondering about stuff like why Led Zepplin broke up in the height of their careers or why The Bourbon Room always seemed to have ups and downs and never a steady flow of people coming in, why he thought moving out to LA and opening a club would rid him of all the stress he was carrying around from his broken up, small-town band and messy divorce, but the one thing he thought about most was Lonny. 4:00pm, the alarm clock rang and Dennis reset it. He got up, stepping over his clothes and a pile of old Rolling Stone magazines, and made a half-assed breakfast of peanut butter on white toast, just like clockwork. As much as he hated getting his ass out of bed and out the door, he had a club to run. A bitch of a club at that. All she did was take and all he did was shit out money for her needs. He laughed at himself, but it was true. The Bourbon Room reminded him of his ex-wife that way, but it if it weren't for The Bourbon, he wouldn't have met Lonny. And there he was, making his way into Dennis' mind again as he ate the rest of his toast and peanut butter. He was just so different. Lonny was the only person Dennis had ever met who had just as many stories to tell as he did. Dennis would tell him about Woodstock, Lonny would tell him about his friends in London, Dennis would tell him about his ex-wife, Lonny would tell about his first threesome and as disgusting as it was, Lonny somehow made the story intriguing. Dennis also knew Lonny wasn't just some junkie who thought he could turn a job at The Bourbon into a nationwide tour overnight. He genuinely loved his job and The Bourbon Room. Dennis could see that right from the moment they met. Lonny was committed. That's why he loved having him around; they both shared that feeling of commitment to The Bourbon Room and to rock n' roll. Lonny was unconditionally devoted to rock n' roll, just like Dennis was. Neither of them had made much of a dent in the music industry and they didn't really want to. They just wanted to listen. Whether it was down at the Bourbon Room's bar or up in Dennis' office, Lonny always made listening better. He had a real passion for it too and it made him see things in ways unimaginable to some. One day back in '83, Dennis was alone in his office, bent over some taxes he knew the Bourbon would have to dip into their last thousand to pay off. He had a few drinks to try to calm his nerves but it wasn't working. He felt like everything he'd ever worked for was going to be smashed to bits right then and there and there was nothing he could do about it. He leaned back, taking it all in: the music blaring from below, the sound of the audience. This was his life, his dream… and his dream was dying. \"Oi, Den,\" Lonny walked in and slouched in the chair beside the desk. Dennis sighed and just looked back at him. He didn't have the motivation or a reason to hide his pain. Lonny grinned after a few seconds of just staring at each other, \"You alright, mate? Looks like you've just listened to Warrant's Cherry Pie after a night on acid.\" Dennis frowned, his lips pursed. \"Is it that bad?\" He almost never understood Lonny's way of speaking, and he doubted he ever really would, but he was starting to at least get a handle on what was good and what was bad. He looked back down at the papers and sighed, taking a sip from the bottle of bourbon on the corner of his desk. \"We're screwed,\" he pointed to the paper on his desk, \"Our last thousand.\" \"No, you can't be serious,\" Lonny took the paper, skimming over the printed numbers and the notes Dennis had made at the bottom. His eyes widened and he shook his head, \"Jesus,\" he put the page down and looked at the look of despair on Dennis' face. \"I don't know what to do,\" Dennis nodded once. In all his years of owning this place, he never once found himself in the position where he needed to ask for help, but he needed it now. If it were him alone right now, he wouldn't know what to do. He'd probably drink until the sun came up and try to figure it out the next day, but then Lonny said something, something that amazed him. \"Oi,\" Lonny stood up, \"here's what you do,\" he grabbed Dennis under his arm and took him to the window. Dennis looked through, down to the floor and the stage below, where the band was playing and the crowd was going wild. \"Forget money, forget taxes, fuck it all! Isn't this what it's about, what it's really about?\" He gestured out the window, \"this monument of decadence,\" he smiled and shrugged, \"The music, mate. That's what it's about. That's why you started this in the first place, yeah? For rock n' roll, Den.\" Maybe it was the amount of alcohol in Dennis or the state of his mind, but Lonny was right. He was really right! It was the first time Lonny showed him the other side of a problem and the first time The Bourbon didn't get their bills paid. (Which escalated to the point of it being threatened by a group of bible-thumping protestors and Stacee Jaxx had to save their ass with the kickoff of his solo career, but we'll get to that later) Dennis finished his shower and shaved. He hated shaving, but the time called for it every few days when it got itchy and distracting. He didn't work well with distractions, as he'd also learned more recently with Lonny around. Whether he was just watching TV in the office or having to be bailed out of jail, he was a huge distraction and any issues in his personal life usually made its way to Dennis eventually. He began to feel a bit like Lonny's personal psychiatrist after a few years. It was a pain in the ass at first, but soon enough Dennis found himself genuinely concerned whenever Lonny was down. As they became closer, Lonny opened up to Dennis more and more until one day, Lonny let him all the way in. Dennis will never forget that day. Lonny came in his office and marched straight to the couch. \"Hey,\" Dennis looked up at him briefly and did a double take. After the second glance, his heart broke. Lonny's arms were crossed, he was staring at the floor and his eyes were red and swollen. \"Hey, what's wrong?\" Dennis was almost overwhelmed; he had never seen Lonny like this or any of his male employees, for that matter. Sure, there was the occasional girl who came in in tears over some jackass who stomped on her heart, but this was different. Silence was not normal for Lonny. This wasn't over some fling that ended overnight. He could tell those were heartbreak tears, but they were serious heartbreak tears. Dennis tried asking again, but Lonny just shook his head, his face straining to stop from crying again. \"Love?\" Dennis asked simply, stepping carefully and trying to get a handle on the situation without adding to the pain. Lonny nodded slowly, \"I thought it was.\" Dennis understood, he didn't need to know anymore. He'd been down the boulevard of broken hearts many times and knew exactly how Lonny felt. Lonny was just a bit more openly emotional about it than he would've been. They spent the next few minutes on the couch, Dennis saying things like, \"there are other brands of whiskey out there,\" or \"at least you have Bon Jovi to help heal your broken heart,\" until Lonny finally broke down and cried into Dennis' shoulder. This was good, he was getting it out and there was no shame in that. Dennis wasn't the most sympathetic person, but he knew that when you wished that you were dead it was good to have a shoulder to cry on… and to keep the knives out of your hands. That was the biggest distraction Lonny had ever caused, but Dennis couldn't say he was disappointed that he spent the whole day comforting his best friend. He learned something about Lonny that day and even more, he learned something about himself. He was in love with Lonny. Lonny Barnett. Dennis was head over heels in love with his best friend, his best male friend. Was he fucking nuts?! Was he high?! He tried to remember back when him and his ex-wife first started seeing each other. He felt exactly like this, only this time was about three times more intense. He was in love and it was another thought keeping him awake at night. He fought it for a long time, but he was truly, clearly, undeniably… secretly in love. Lonny's passion and energy made Dennis feel young again, they had a bond like brothers and Lonny was just perfect, inside and out. But a life with Lonny was just a crazy fantasy. Lonny wouldn't understand and there was nothing more pathetic than some middle-aged man chasing after a young thing like that. Dennis had seen that too many times at The Bourbon Room and it never ended with happily ever after. And so, for years Dennis kept it to himself. He loved Lonny, but he loved him too much to ruin their friendship. Shit, that all seemed like a box of dusty records as he got dressed quietly and looked at Lonny sleeping in his bed now. He smiled and reached down to the side of Lonny's neck where he was sleeping. Lonny stirred awake and opened one eye lazily. \"Whaaat?\" He groaned, turning over, \"Jesus. Bloody vested, hippy, bastard…\" Dennis chuckled at his usual morning greeting and let Lonny sleep, watching him with all the thoughts from earlier running through his head. \"Go ooon,\" Lonny mumbled, \"I can feel you're bloody eyes on me.\" Dennis rolled his eyes and left the apartment, leaving his hungover lover in peace. He still thought about Lonny, but in a different way now. Now his thoughts were about how much he loved him and cared for him, what a rockin' lover he was… In the best way possible, things were different.

The Bourbon was closed for the evening, and the two men were knocking back a few drinks before calling it a night. Dennis had just finished telling Lonny the story of his ex-wife, which, while it had ended on horrible terms, was actually rather amusing. When they'd recovered from their laughing fit, Dennis asked for a similar story. \"Ok, your turn.\" He announced as he ran his fingers through his hair. \"What do you mean?\" \"Come on. I just told you about the second greatest heartbreak of my life. It's your turn to tell me yours.\" Lonny only waved Dennis off with one hand and took another sip of Bourbon. \"Nah.\" Dennis smirked and trailed kisses down Lonny's jawline, knowing how much it would drive the younger man crazy. \"Tell me.\" He whispered. \"You'll be bored.\" Lonny replied quietly, biting his lip while Dennis continued to kiss his neck. \"Tell me.\" Dennis said again. Lonny rolled his eyes. He'd only ever had one huge heartbreak, aside from the constant one that came with having a huge crush on Dennis, a man he was certain he could never have, and he wasn't overly eager to let Dennis know about it. \"Fine, I seriously reckon you'll be bored though.\" Lonny mumbled as they shifted around on the couch to make themselves more comfortable. Dennis leaned back, with one arm draped over the back of the chair, while Lonny sat cross-legged with his back against the armrest, facing Dennis. \"Ok. You remember that… rough patch I went through a few years back? March 1978?\" Dennis nodded. How could he forget? Dennis had been minding his own business, filling out paperwork (mostly forms from the taxation department) when Lonny had stumbled into the office. It was clear that the brunette had had way too much to drink. It was also clear that he'd been out in the rain – he was soaked, shivering, and sobbing hysterically. After a minute of two, Lonny said (between sobs) that it was heartbreak that had him devastated. He wouldn't give a name, but he said that this love interest had cheated on him with Stacee Jaxx. Dennis chose to believe him. After a few hours, Dennis managed to calm his friend down, and drove him home. At Ten O'clock the next morning, Dennis was woken up by a phone call from the hospital. Lonny had apparently gotten drunk and swallowed a bunch of pills, a suicide attempt, not doubt. Lonny was a mess when Dennis showed up at the hospital. According to doctors, he'd been sleeping off the effects of the pills, and would be drowsy for a while. The deep cut on his left wrist had required five stitches – the one on the other wrist required six. \" Why did you do it? Dennis asked as he took the seat closest to Lonny's hospital bed. Lonny shrugged, he still looked drowsy. \" I guess I just didn't want to live anymore. What was the point, y'know?\" Lonny muttered hoarsely, \"For the first time in my life, I thought I meant something to someone. I thought I mattered. But I was just an experiment. And that hurt.\" Dennis frowned, remembering how long it had taken to get Lonny on the straight and narrow again. There had been two more failed suicide attempts after that one – Dennis didn't want to think about it. He just wrapped his arms around Lonny and held him closer. \"Who were they?\" He asked. Lonny smiled. \"Arsenal was back in town for another show. They were already huge, as you well know, but they weren't quite at the top of the charts… yet. They were scheduled to stay in the general Los Angeles area for about a month or so, doing a bunch of gigs in the town that made them famous. You'll probably remember that I was quite the Arsenal fan too. Their first show was at the Bourbon, and I was fortunate enough to get up close and personal with THE Stacee Jaxx.\" \" So, are you excited about the show?\" Stacee questioned, removing his aviators to get a good look at the man in front of him. Lonny nodded nervously. \" Y-Yeah.\" Stacee thought for a moment. For the past few days, he'd been wondering something. He'd never been with a guy before… what if he was gay? How would he know? He liked women, sure, but what if he was missing out on something amazing? How would he know if he didn't… experiment? Lonny had been thrilled. When Stacee took an interest in him, he thought he was something special. He thought he meant something to the rock god. Back then, Stacee hadn't given a damn about anyone else, so long as he got what he wanted. The arrival of Constance Sack had changed all that. But Stacee strung Lonny along for the whole time he was in LA – about six weeks, one of the longest relationships either of them had ever had. Lonny fell more and more in love with Stacee, as time went on. And Stacee got more and more bored, and started seeing other women on the side. When Stacee left LA, he abruptly ended his relationship with Lonny (who had never seen it coming) after one last session of love making in Stacee's dressing room. Stacee was lying on his back on the couch, with Lonny half asleep on top of him. Arsenal was on in ten minutes. \" Don't forget me, while you're on tour.\" Lonny murmured as he ran a finger up and down Stacee's chest. \" Listen, about that.\" \" Bout' what, Stace?\" Lonny asked, sitting up. \" Look, kid. This has been fun and all, but I really don't think it's gonna work out?\" \" What do you mean?\" Lonny was becoming more and more confused, \"Don't you love me anymore?\" \" Donny, please-\" \" It's Lonny actually.\" \" Whatever. My mind is so complex, that I can't just stay tied down to one person for the rest of my life-\" \" Y-you can see other people as well! I don't care! Just don't shut me out of your life!\" \" It was fun while it lasted. Really, I enjoyed it. But I think it's best that you don't mention this to anyone else, I mean, I might never get a girl again!\" \" So I was just a game to you? An experiment?\" Stacee shrugged. \" I'll give you a call next time I'm in town.\" Stacee said off-handedly, \"Now, I think you should go. I'm on in five minutes. I trust you can see yourself out.\" Lonny only stared. As the hurt settled in, his heart broke, he punched Stacee in the face. Stacee yelped as Lonny's scorpion ring cut into his cheek. Arsenal was recording a live album at the Bourbon. It had been almost a year since Stacee broke up with Lonny, and the brunette was handling things nicely. He'd already had a few one night stands, and he always made it quite clear that he didn't want anything more than that. The last thing he wanted was to be responsible for his date of the evening's three suicide attempts… Dennis had been there every step of the way, and Lonny had spent most of his time trying to deny his feelings for his boss. It was ridiculous. He'd just gotten out of a serious relationship. Besides, there was no way Dennis would go for a guy like him anyway. ' Still,' Lonny said to himself, 'Den does look pretty gorgeous in those jeans…' He shook his head to clear the thought. He wasn't about to let his best friend become a rebound, one night stand. Even if he did look good in those jeans. Today was they day they were supposed to be recording Arsenal's new album; Arsenal, live at the Bourbon 1979. Creative title. Stacee sauntered in, followed by several groupies, glanced at Lonny, and stopped dead in his tracks. \" Lonny.\" He said after a moment. Lonny clapped sarcastically. \" Well done Stace. You finally got my name right.\" \" You're alive? Dennis told me you killed yourself.\" \" Tried to kill myself.\" Lonny corrected, \"Three times. First time I got the pill dosage wrong, second time the rope broke, and third time Dennis managed to coax me off the roof.\" Lonny smiled at the memory. He'd been standing on the roof of the Bourbon, ready to jump, watching the police cars and staff members tell him not to do it. Dennis ran up onto the roof, looking distressed, and yelled; \" Lonny don't do it! It'll be bad for business!\" Whether Dennis had been joking or deadly serious, Lonny wasn't sure. But it had made him laugh, and he was willing to get off the roof. \" Three failed attempts?\" Stacee questioned, \"Why?\" \" Because of you, you bloody bastard!\" Lonny yelled, \"Do I mean anything to you at all? Did I mean anything to you ever?\" \" Ssh.\" Stacee muttered, \"Keep your voice down. You want everyone to hear you?\" Lonny nodded. \" Yeah. I hope everyone hears. I hope your reputation's ruined forever!\" Stacee stared. \" I'll deal with you in a minute.\" He whispered before turning to his groupies, \"Come on girls.\" As the three girls walked by, Lonny looked one up and down. \" What's your name?\" He asked, the girl smiled. \" Patty.\" \" Huh. Well Patty, you been following Stacee around long?\" \" Oh yeah. We've been dating for a few days now. I think it's getting serious.\" The girl chirped with excitement, \"I think he loves me!\" Lonny snorted. \" Yeah. I used to think he loved me too.\" Stacee dragged Lonny into the dressing room in a rage. He was angry with Lonny for making a scene, but angry with himself for hurting the brunette so badly. \" Look, I'm sorry. I really am. I never meant to be so bad to you. But it's just not going to work. I, I can't risk my reputation. Besides, you need to be with someone who deserves you.\" \" B-but, I love you Stace.\" \" I know… but I don't want to hurt you anymore.\" Lonny leaned in, and Stacee didn't object. Dennis headed towards Stacee's dressing room. He'd seen Lonny and Stacee disappear, but he wasn't sure why. When he walked in, he glared. \" Lonny. Out.\" Dennis jerked his head towards the door. Lonny obeyed, taking a last look at Stacee before leaving. \" What the hell are you doing?\" Dennis asked. Stacee shrugged. \" What business is it of yours?\" \" He nearly killed himself because of you! Do you have any idea what you put us through?\" \" Us?\" Stacee raised an eyebrow, \"Since when are you and Lonny together?\" \" I happen to care about my staff.\" \" Oh, but when I break the heart of one of your barmaids, you suddenly don't give a shit? Since when Is Lonny different?\" \" Look, just keep away from him alright? He's going through a rough patch right now. No thanks to you. You asshole.\" Stacee rolled his eyes. \" Look, just because you so obviously have feelings for him-\" \" I DO NOT HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM!\" Stacee raised his eyebrows again. \" Fine.\" \" You're on in five.\" Dennis muttered before storming out of the room. Stacee sighed and sat down on the couch. \" Jackass.\" He muttered. Dennis returned to the main part of the Bourbon. \" Ok, let's get moving. Groupies, get off the stage, Arsenal, get ready for sound check, Lonny, stay where I can see you and for the love of god, behave.\" Lonny smirked and took a seat at the bar. After sorting out a few things, Dennis took the seat next to him. They sat in silence for a moment, and made a little small talk before Lonny finally spoke about what had happened earlier. \" So, are we going to keep tiptoeing around the elephant in the room, or are we gonna talk about what happened earlier?\" Dennis shrugged. \" Do you want to talk about it?\" \" Do you want me to want to talk about it?\" Dennis rolled his eyes. \" Let's just pretend it never happened.\" He said as he draped an arm over Lonny's shoulder. Lonny grinned. \" Thanks Den.\" Dennis was fuming by the end of the story. Lonny had cut out a few of the details, like why he and Stacee had been kissing in the dressing room, in order to save time. Lonny sighed. About eight years later, and the event was still painful to talk about. \"You and Stacee?\" Dennis questioned, still dumbfounded. \"Yeah. Me and Stacee.\" \"…Wow. I had no idea…\" \"You ok? You look sort of, mad.\" Dennis shook his head and pulled Lonny even closer. \"Because of Stacee Jaxx, my rock n' roll brother, I nearly lost the most important person in my life, three times.\" Lonny sighed. \"Yeah. He's one hell of a lover though.\" Dennis snorted angrily. \"But you're much better.\" Lonny added. \"Hmph. Sure.\" \"No really Den. You and me, are the best.\" Dennis smiled. \"We are pretty fantastic.\" \"You're way better than Stacee you know.\" Lonny added, sipping the last of his drink. \"His loss is my gain.\" Dennis murmured, kissing Lonny on the cheek. The following day, while Lonny was still asleep, Dennis called Stacee. \"Hello?\" Stacee croaked. He sounded hung over. \"Stacee its Dennis. Get your miserable ass down here right now, before I come down there and sort this out in front of your girlfriend.\" Stacee could tell that something was wrong, but didn't dare ask what. He simply yanked on his leather pants and left. When Stacee entered the Bourbon, he opened his mouth to ask what was wrong, but shut it again when Dennis slammed him against the wall. \"You son of a bitch.\" He snarled. Stacee raised his eyebrows. \"Déjá Vu.\" He muttered. After the album had been recorded, Dennis pretty much kicked Stacee out of the club. \" Get out and stay out. If I ever see you anywhere near this club again I'll amputate your god damn balls. Do you understand?\" Stacee nodded before Dennis threw him out the doors. It would be years before Stacee would hear from Dennis again . \"You broke his heart.\" Dennis growled, \"You used him up and spat him out like he was nothing! He could've died, and it would've been your fault. He loved you Stacee Jaxx! Did you ever love him? Or was he just another one night stand?\" \"What do you care?\" Stacee asked, his anger levels on the rise, \"I thought you'd be pleased. Everything turned out alright for you, didn't it? What about all the other chicks I used? Do you care about them? Of course not. They're not as important as your precious little sidekick.\" \"Answer the god damn question!\" Dennis spat. \"Alright!\" Stacee yelled, avoiding Dennis' eyes, \"Y-yes. I did love him. I just, I didn't know how to deal with it. I was scared. I'd never… cared so much about anyone I'd been with before. I couldn't handle it!\" \"So, what? You just kicked him to the curb?\" \"It wasn't like that! I thought I could just end it and he'd move on. He's a good guy, Dennis. More than you deserve.\" \"Yeah, and a lot more than YOU deserve. God help Constance if this is how you treat the people you care about!\" \"Let me finish!\" After Lonny's third suicide attempt, Dennis was a mess. Maybe even more so than Lonny. He'd loved Lonny for two years, and seeing his best friend like this was breaking his heart. Somebody needed to suffer. Somebody needed to feel guilty. \" Stacee. It's Dennis. I just thought I'd let you know that, Lonny… he committed suicide last night. He jumped off the roof of the Bourbon before anyone could stop him.\" Stacee was silent for a long time. \" He-he's dead?\" \" Yeah. He's dead.\" Stacee bit his lip to fight back the tears. \" Well, thanks for letting me know. I'll um, see you. I've gotta go record a new single…\" Stacee trailed off, stifling sobs. Dennis smiled with bitter satisfaction. He knew he should feel guilty, Stacee had clearly taken it badly, but he couldn't bring himself to do so. Lonny was miserable, he looked like the walking dead, and he hadn't eaten in two days. Dennis looked up from his seat behind the desk to see Lonny asleep on the couch. Dennis forced himself to look away, his heart was breaking. \"You know, telling someone that the person they love is dead when they're not, is not a nice thing to do.\" Stacee muttered. Dennis shrugged. \"You had it coming.\" \"Anyway, I thought he was dead for almost a year before I had to visit the Bourbon to record that album. When I saw he was alive… You know I considered taking him with me when I left? I had all these, crazy ideas on how to keep him in my life. Then I saw you. The way you look at him, it's like you'd do anything for him. You're so protective. You don't care about the Bourbon the way you care about him. I knew he was in good hands. So I left.\" \"You, nearly, killed him. He lost, so much weight. I thought I was gonna lose him.\" Dennis sighed. \"I know. I never meant to..\" \"Do you still love him?\" Dennis asked after a moment. Stacee chuckled. \"Jealous?\" He questioned as he lit up a cigarette. \"Would you blame me?\" Dennis responded, allowing Stacee to move away from the wall. Stacee shook his head. \"No. I don't blame you. And yeah, I guess I do still love him. But, I don't think I could compete with you. He'd do anything for you.\" \"He'd do anything for you.\" Stacee shook his head again. \"No. I've hurt him too badly now. He doesn't love me enough to forgive me for what I did. And I think Constance opened up old wounds.\" Lonny stood at the doorway of the office. Stacee and Constance were sitting at the bar. They'd been dating for two months now. And as far as Lonny was aware, Stacee hadn't seen anyone else on the side either. \" Hmph. That Stacee Jaxx. He's got such a complex mind. Too complex to focus on one person at a time. Christ, what a load of bullshit.\" He rolled his eyes. Dennis appeared behind him and wrapped his arms around him. \" Did you say something Lon?\" Dennis asked as he rested his head on Lonny's shoulder. \" Nah. Just thinking aloud I spose'.\" \" You gonna be much longer?\" Dennis questioned. Lonny grinned. \" Gimme' another minute or so.\" He responded. Dennis nodded. \" Ok. By the way, I love you in that shirt.\" Lonny's grin grew wider as he glanced down at Dennis' KISS T-shirt. It was the first thing he'd found when he got up. \" Hmm, I'll have to where it more often then.\" He took one last look at Stacee and Constance, and then back in the direction of the bedroom and smiled. He'd made his choice, and he was going to stick by it. And no rock god was going to tear Lonny away from his beloved Dennis Dupree. \"Look, I gave Lonny up. And I know, I hurt him. But that's my cross to bear. I have to live with that, and watch you two together for the rest of my life. But I can live with that. Just, take my advice. Don't ever hurt him. Because you might not ever get him back.\" Stacee pushed past Dennis, and left the Bourbon. ","Summary":" Dennis and Lonny were sitting in the office.

Happy for her and everything, but still. I feel slightly inadequate. Plus I'm suffering from the painful disease known as love, which doesn't help. Have some heavily edited early material while I lie down and sulk. It was the night Lonny and Dennis confessed their love for each other, after the terrible concert involving the Z-Guyeez. Lonny had fallen asleep easily, with the biggest smile on his face, but Dennis was still awake. He stared at Lonny, in plain dis-belief. 'This would have to be the best night of my life .' He thought. For some reason he couldn't entirely fathom, he decided he needed a drink. He tried to think of the last time someone besides himself had been in the apartment. He realised it must have been his ex-wife, Brenda. \"God help us if Lonny and I turn out the way Brenda and I did.\" He muttered bitterly. He opened the cupboard and pulled out a bottle. He opened it and took a drink. He frowned. Vodka. Brenda's favourite drink. Figures. A cupboard filled with whiskey and bourbon and he had to stumble on a bottle that belonged to Brenda, that he didn't even know he had. He tried to think of a reason why he'd stayed with Brenda for so long. He had loved her though. That much he knew. But it was a love-hate relationship; with him loving absolutely everything about her, and her hating his very soul. Strictly speaking, it was hard to believe SHE stayed with someone she hated so much for so long. He wondered if Lonny remembered Brenda. Maybe not Brenda exactly, but the way Dennis acted because of her. When Lonny came along, Dennis had been married for about a year and three months. By the time he and Lonny were the best of friends, he'd been married to her for a little over two years. 'She never liked Lonny' , Dennis remembered 'She was angry as hell when I promoted him. But he didn't exactly like her either.' Yes. He remembered the look Lonny would have when Brenda was around. It was a brief look, he hid it well, but Dennis always saw. He knew now it was probably jealousy, or envy, or maybe just general heartbreak. Those first few years must have been difficult for Lonny. But he was always flawlessly polite to Brenda, it was when Brenda wasn't around and Dennis started talking about their relationship woes that he got annoyed. It wasn't the way he spoke, he never said anything for or against her, it was his body language. He would stiffen and stay relatively silent. But what Dennis remembered the most was how much he'd depended on Lonny when Brenda left. Brenda left after the Bourbon closed. She and Dennis had an enormous fight. She wanted him to close the Bourbon. She said she was sick of Rock N' Roll and wanted a normal life. She wanted Dennis to get a job in an office somewhere while she sat on her ass all day and waited for him to come home so she could abuse the hell out of him, before swearing she loved him more than anybody else. He refused saying the Bourbon was his life and he couldn't just pack up and leave. So she left instead. For a two days, and night in between, Dennis didn't leave the apartment. He didn't eat, or drink anything. He didn't shower, he didn't even move from the couch. He couldn't remember crying at that point in time, maybe he had, but the only memory he had of that nearly unbearable point in time was the intense pain in his chest. After hearing that Dennis still hadn't come into work, Lonny summoned the courage to actually go up into Dennis' apartment and look for him. \"Dennis? You ok?\" Lonny had said, his face showed nothing but worry. Dennis remembered that Lonny had just recently cut his hair into the mullet Dennis knew and loved, and that he stank of whiskey and cigarettes, which, funnily enough, was not a bad combination of smells. He remembered that Lonny had forced him to eat and drink, and if there was a moment when Lonny had left Dennis' side, he couldn't remember it. It was about day three when Dennis was out of his hysterical state of mind (he could remember crying a lot, much to his embarrassment) and was able to tell Lonny what had happened. Lonny had been sympathetic and understanding, but not at all surprised. Dennis hadn't been sure how he felt about that, he still wasn't actually. * Lonny woke up. It was only just light outside. There was an empty space in the bed next to him. He frowned and got up. He pulled on Dennis shirt, Simply because it was there, and walked down the hall. \"Dennis?\" Dennis looked up. Lonny was standing in the doorway, looking sinfully gorgeous in Dennis' shirt. He smiled. \"Hi.\" Dennis said. Lonny walked over and sat down next to Dennis. Dennis put his arm around him and Lonny leant into Dennis' chest. \"Do you remember Brenda?\" Dennis asked. Lonny snorted. \"The mega-bitch? Yeah. I remember her. What you bringing her up for? Oh god, please tell me I'm better in bed than the mega-bitch. I don't reckon I could go on you know, Den. If the mega-bitch did more for you than I did.\" Dennis laughed, remembering that it as Lonny who'd come up with the mega-bitch nickname. \"Much, much better than the mega-bitch.\" He kissed the top of Lonny's head reassuringly. \"Thank the bloody lord.\" Lonny muttered, \"What are you bringing her up for then?\" \"Just thinking.\" \"About?\" \"The last time someone other than me was in the apartment.\" \"It was me wasn't it?\" \"Yep. And before that it was-\" \"-The god damn bloody mega-bitch.\" Lonny said with a shiver \"Just thinking about her makes my skin crawl.\" \"You really hate her don't you?\" \"More than you'll ever know.\" \"Jealous?\" Dennis said jokingly. Lonny blushed. \"Maybe.\" He mumbled. Dennis stared at him. \"Please tell me you're joking.\" Lonny's blush deepened. \"Are you serious? Your jealous? Of her? The mega-bitch?\" \"Not exactly. It's difficult to explain. I'm sort of jealous coz she had you. But I hate the way she treated you. I hate it when people treat you like shit.\" Dennis sighed. \"Then There's a helluva lot of people I'm glad you never met.\" \"Really? Like who?\" \"My Father for one.\" \"Why? What'd he do?\" \"Um...\" \"Dennis?\" Lonny whispered. \"That son of a bitch roughed you up didn't he?\" Dennis nodded. Lonny scowled. The grip he had on Dennis' hand tightened. \"I'm fine.\" Dennis said. He pulled Lonny closer. \"I'm fine.\" He said again \"Can I ask you a question?\" \"Sure.\" \"I want you to be completely honest.\" Dennis nodded. \"Am I really better in bed than the mega-bitch?\" Dennis rolled his eyes. He could tell Lonny was just trying to take Dennis' mind off things, and it was working. \"Lonny, you made sex with the mega-bitch look mind numbingly boring.\" Lonny grinned. \"Am I sexier than the mega-bitch?\" Dennis laughed. \"Yes. A million times sexier. Do you remember your last girlfriend?\" \"Oh yeah! The sexy blonde who broke up with me coz of my apartment.\" \"What was wrong with your apartment?\" \"It was too small.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah. And I told her; ' Haven't you ever made love in the bedroom and the kitchen at the same time ?'\" Dennis laughed. \"Am I sexier than her?\" Dennis asked. Lonny laughed. \"You shouldn't even have to ask! Of course you are!\" \"So, did you end up making love in the bedroom in the kitchen at the same time?\" Dennis asked. \"Ha, no.\" They stayed silent for a moment. \"Can I ask a question?\" Dennis asked. Lonny nodded. \"Sure.\" \"When was the last time you got laid?\" \"About two hours ago.\" Dennis laughed. \"By a girl.\" Lonny coughed and looked up at the ceiling. \"I mean, you've... done it, before though. Right?\" Dennis asked. \"Of course! Just, not for a while…\" \"Seriously?\" \"Yeah.\" \"But, you're the biggest ladies' man around!\" \"Stacee Jaxx.\" Lonny responded simply. \"Oh, right.\" \"Well... there were a couple of girls. I think the most recent one was about... I dunno. Half a year ago?\" Dennis quirked an eyebrow. \"But, you're, you're… have you seen you?\" \"Look, just because you fancy me, doesn't mean the rest of the planet does. Ok, so I haven't done it with any girls .\" He grinned a little when Dennis realised what he was implying. \"…What?\" \"I said, I haven't done it with many girls.\" \"…But, what, you've done it with guys?\" \"A couple.\" \"A- A couple? You mean, more than one?\" \"Well, there's you. Then there's that bar back who used to work at the Bourbon, the blonde, then there's Stacee.\" \"Stacee? As in Jaxx?\" \"Yeah. I dunno why he gets all the girls. It wasn't spectacular. Mundane really.\" \"…And the blonde?\" \"Terrible. Worst lover I've ever had. He was selfish, he was crude, he cried out some other girl's name… god awful. And then there's you. Kind, caring, sexy as all hell…\" Lonny found himself grinning stupidly at the thought. \"You're the best I've ever had you know.\" Lonny murmured Dennis chuckled and undid the buttons on Lonny's shirt. \"Let's keep it that way.\" The End. Well. Technically speaking, it's just the beginning, but you know what I mean. :) ","Summary":" I love it when you go from the fanfiction kid at your school to second best coz you're bestie start"},{"Movie":"Rock of Ages","Title":"Office Affair","Author":"TeekayStaples","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10151660","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Lonny sat in the office, smirking to himself. It was a Friday night, about ten O'clock. Concrete Ballz was rocking out downstairs, Dennis was sorting through a pile of paperwork that had built up over about a week, and Lonny was flicking through the channels on the TV. Every so often, they would glance up at each other, and Lonny would lick his lips or play with his hair. And Dennis would grit his teeth and look away. He had to get this paperwork finished, and Lonny was distracting him on purpose. Lonny looked up again with a smile and flicked his hair behind his shoulder. He bit his lip and looked away. Dennis sighed audibly. Screw the paperwork. Lonny was driving him crazy. \"Lonny.\" He said as he stood up, \"Get over here.\" Lonny grinned eagerly and got up from the couch. Before he could speak, Dennis pressed his lips against Lonny's and Lonny could feel himself being lowered onto the desk. He vaguely heard the pile of paperwork Dennis had been working on fall to the floor, and wondered if they were going to stop and pick it all up. \"Leave it.\" Dennis muttered as he pulled the suspenders off Lonny's shoulders. Sherrie pushed the door to the office open without thinking. \"Dennis I-\" She trailed off and stared at the sight before her. Lonny and Dennis turned their heads slightly to stare back at her. Lonny was unsure if he should untangle his legs from Dennis' waist, put his shirt on and get of the desk, or if he should stay where he was. \"Yes Sherrie?\" Dennis questioned. \"I um, I needed to talk to you-\" \"Can it wait? I'm kind of in the middle of something.\" He glanced down a t Lonny, who smiled smugly. It was nice to know that he was still on Dennis' list of priorities. Sherrie nodded uncertainly and backed out of the room. \"Where were we?\" Dennis asked. Lonny responded by kissing Dennis desperately. Sherrie stood outside the door to the office for a moment. She couldn't believe what she'd just seen. She knew Lonny and Dennis were close but she never thought… \"Sherrie? You ok?\" Drew asked. Sherrie nodded. \"Yeah.\" \"Did you tell them about the blocked toilet?\" \"No. They were busy.\" Drew frowned. \"Busy? Doing what?\" Sherrie only shook her head.

The night had been a blur. Two glasses had quickly turned into five, and that soon turned into seven. Then he lost count. It had been one hell of a party, he knew that much. Lonny had thrown Dennis a surprise party at the Bourbon to celebrate his birthday. There might've been cake (Dennis honestly couldn't remember) but he remembered that there were presents, and Arsenal had been there, although Dennis had no idea how Lonny had managed that. When he woke up, his head was pounding and he felt slightly sick. He opened his eyes and found that he was face to face with Lonny. Without moving around too much, he took a moment to work out where he was. He was lying on the office floor in the same clothes he'd been wearing the previous night. He and Lonny both had their arms wrapped around each other, and Lonny was snoring softly. He badly needed to get up and stretch, but if he did, Lonny would wake up. And, let's be honest, when would he have Lonny that close again? He went back to sleep. Lonny woke up. He had a horrible headache, but he was used to that by now. He opened his eyes and his heart skipped a beat when he saw how close he was to his best friend. The events of last night came flooding back to him and he realised that they must've passed out in the office after the party. He winced and realised that his foot had fallen asleep. He reluctantly sat up and sighed sadly. \"Happy birthday Den.\" He said with a smile. He hesitated for a moment before kissing Dennis on the forehead, \"Love you.\" He added in a mumble before moving to get up. Dennis' eyes snapped open at the words. Before Lonny could get up, Dennis grabbed him by the back of his suspenders and pulled him back onto the floor. \"What did you say?\" Lonny's face went bright red. \"I-I thought you were asleep.\" \"Lonny, what did you just say?\" Lonny stared at Dennis, fear evident in his brown eyes. He couldn't tell if Dennis was happy or angry or just plain shocked. \"Um, I said... happy birthday?\" He said it uncertainly, without confidence as he waited for Dennis' response. \"Did you say... did you say you loved me?\" \"Uh... well, I thought you were sleeping, and very, very hung over.\" \"Lonny, answer me. Did you say you loved me or didn't you?\" Lonny bit his lip. He hated when Dennis stared at him for too long. It made him more nervous than he already was. Sure enough, he struggled to speak as Dennis refused to take his eyes off him. \"I ugh... well... um...\" Lonny wasn't usually one to be lost for words. Most of the time, he was talking Dennis' ear off. Getting him to shut up, that was the problem. Dennis couldn't help but find it a little amusing that Lonny was struggling to speak. Fortunately, Lonny noticed Dennis' slight smirk and it made him feel slightly more at ease. He sighed. \"Yes. I did say it.\" They stared at each other for what seemed like ages. \"...Did, did you mean it?\" Dennis asked. Lonny nodded cautiously, still waiting for Dennis' response. Dennis said nothing. He just stared. \"Dennis? You ok?\" No response. \"Come on Den, say something. You're freaking me out a bit.\" \"You, meant it?\" \"We don't have to act on it.\" Lonny said as he scrambled to his feet. Unfortunately, his left foot was still asleep and he came crashing down next to Dennis again. Lonny quickly launched into a long winded explanation that soon had him gasping for air, Dennis smiled at him, looking very amused. \"Are you finished?\" He asked after several minutes. Lonny opened his mouth to say more but Dennis silenced him by placing a finger to Lonny's lips, making him blush immensely. \"I love you too.\" Dennis said quietly, still half smirking. Lonny blinked. \"You what?\" \"I love you too.\" Dennis repeated casually. Lonny's eyes widened. Never, never in a million years did he think Dennis would ever say that. \"Really?\" \"Yeah. I mean, you can be a real pain in the ass sometimes, but in all honesty, I don't think I could live without you.\" Lonny grinned, unable to recall a time when he was this happy as Dennis' lips crashed into his. \"Best birthday ever.\" Dennis muttered as he and Lonny separated for a total of three seconds. \"Really?\" \"Yeah, because I got the best possible present. You.\" \"No refunds.\" Lonny joked. Dennis chuckled. \"I wouldn't dare.\" The End ","Summary":" Ragged night Dennis had no idea that he'd drunk so much until he passed out on the office floor.

This is my new story on Lonny and Dennis! Yay! There isn't nearly enough Lonnis fics out there, so I'll do my best to up the population a little! Enjoy! Please R&R;! Lonny had only been working at the Bourbon for two days when his roommate kicked him out, beat him up and stole all his money. With nothing but the clothes on his back, three extra pairs of suspenders, a limp, numerous cuts and bruises, a cracked rib and blood nose, he ended up camping on the men's room floor of the Bourbon since it was close to work and the rent was free. He plugged his nose with toilet paper and hoped he wouldn't bleed to death while he slept, before falling asleep on the floor. It was four AM when he passed out, and 2 PM when he was woken up. Something nudged his foot. He looked up to see that it had been his unbearably sexy boss, Dennis Dupree's shoe. \"Lonny?\" Dennis asked. He gasped. Dennis Dupree knew his name! Dennis Dupree! The legend who created the Bourbon room! He was certain there was no way a guy like Dennis would be interested in a guy like him, so He was absolutely thrilled to hear Dennis say his name. \"Uh,\" Lonny smiled sheepishly, \"Hi Mr Dupree. Lovely morning isn't it?\" \"It's the afternoon.\" Dennis replied. \"Oh.\" \"What are you doing? Why is there toilet paper in your nose?\" \"Oh, Blood nose.\" \"You shouldn't lay on your back then. The blood might run into your lungs.\" \"Oops.\" Lonny said as he sat up. \"You look pretty smashed up.\" \"Well, that might be an exaggeration.\" Lonny mumbled. \"Come on, I have a first-aid kit in the office.\" Dennis sat Lonny in the desk chair of the office while he searched for the first-aid kit. \"So what's the show for tonight then?\" Lonny asked, not really caring. \"No idea.\" Dennis said, \"None of my old contacts are free, and I haven't had any luck finding anyone else good enough for the Bourbon.\" Dennis emerged from under the couch with the first-aid kit. \"I reckon I know someone you could call.\" Lonny said as Dennis covered the cut on Lonny's forehead with a Band-Aid. As Dennis smoothed out the edges of the Band-Aid, the tips of his fingers brushed against Lonny's forehead. Both men froze. The last time either of them had felt that spark was a couple of days ago, when Lonny handed Dennis his application and their fingers had barely touched... An awkward silence settled over both of them. Dennis cleared his throat. \"You said you knew someone I could call. Who exactly?\" Lonny smiled, a twinkle of excitement in his eye. \"Arsenal.\" He said simply. \"Ok. That's Arsenal booked. I think I can find somebody as an opener. So you wanna tell me why you're not in your apartment at three in the afternoon when you have work tonight?\" \"I don't have an apartment any more mate. My roommate kicked me out.\" \"So where are you staying?\" \"At the moment?\" Dennis nodded. \"The men's room floor of the Bourbon.\" Dennis sighed. \"You can sleep on the couch in the office.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah. It's warmer and probably safer.\" \"Wow. Thanks Mr Dupree!\" Dennis smiled. \"Call me Dennis.\" Lonny smiled back. Lonny was dozing on the couch in the Bourbon. It was five PM and Dennis was trying to do some work. A difficult thing to do when the most gorgeous person ever was about a metre away from him. Dennis felt unbelievably creepy. Just sitting there, watching Lonny sleep. \"Dennis...\" Lonny mumbled before rolling over. Dennis blinked. Had he just heard correctly? He couldn't believe it! The phone rang and Lonny shot up screaming. Dennis stared at him for a moment before cracking up laughing. Lonny glared at him. He leaned back onto the couch and watched Dennis answer the phone. \"Bourbon.\" Dennis said simply \"Uh huh. We need an opener for tonight actually. Guns N' Roses? How do you spell that?\" Dennis wrote something down on a piece of paper. \"Ok. Be here at six thirty for sound check. We open at eight. Ok. See you then.\" \"Who was that Den?\" Lonny asked. Dennis froze. He'd never really had a nickname before. His friends and family had just called him Dennis. But he liked the way it sounded. He smiled at Lonny. \"That's was the manager of this band; Guns N' Roses.\" Lonny nodded. \"Yeah I've heard of them.\" \"Yeah, well anyway, we've got an opener for tonight.\" Lonny grinned. \"That's excellent! What time is it?\" \"Ten past five.\" Lonny rolled over and went back to sleep. \"Den...\" He mumbled again. Dennis grinned. * The Arsenal show was an enormous success. It brought in more money than Dennis could have possibly imagined and he was extremely grateful to Lonny. Which was why, he was considering giving Lonny a promotion. He knew he had feelings for Lonny he couldn't quite understand, and maybe having Lonny around would help him decipher these feelings. Plus the fact, Lonny had an ear for talent and clearly liked spending time at the Bourbon. After weighing up the pros and realising there were no cons, he went to find Lonny. It was eleven PM and Lonny was on his break. Most workers went to the tower records place or to the Venus club on their break, but not Lonny. Lonny was crowd surfing, somewhat drunk screaming \"I love the Bourbon!\" at the top of his lungs. Dennis couldn't help but laugh. Lonny saw him and waved. He looked down at the people below him and said to them; \"Set me down here thanks lads.\" They promptly dropped him on his head. Dennis flinched as he heard the loud thud of Lonny colliding with the floor. He hopped up straight away and walked over to Dennis. \"Alright Den?\" Lonny asked. \"Never mind me. What about you?\" \"Well, my cracked rib's a bit worse for wear but other than that I'm fantastic!\" He leant over to whisper into Dennis ear \"In fact, I found out something absolutely shocking!\" \"You did? What was it?\" Lonny smiled and flicked his hair, making Dennis melt. \"All the other bar backs call you Mr Dupree.\" He said happily. Dennis blushed and shrugged. \"So I have a favourite. No big deal. You won't be a bar back for much longer anyway.\" Lonny's face fell. \"I won't? Why not?\" \"Starting next Monday, you're the manager.\" Lonny stared at him. \"You're not messing with me are you Den?\" Dennis smiled and shook his head. \"Does that mean you're serious?\" Dennis nodded \"Jesus Christ!\" \"Does that mean you're pleased?\" \"I'm thrilled!\" Lonny pulled his boss into a tight hug, (which Dennis definitely wasn't expecting) before he ran through the crowds of people screaming \"I'm gonna be the manager of the Bourbon! Woo!\" He then tripped over something (possibly his own feet) and fell face first. But he quickly got up. \"I'm alright! Woo!\" Dennis laughed. What do you think? I actually wrote the draft for this ages ago. It was one of my first stories. I published a slightly different version on Wattpad, but I got fed up with the formatting on watty and the amount of chapters I lost on my stories! Anyway, since this is early and I've always had trouble with Dennis' character (Seriously man. I love you, and we're alike in a lot of ways but you're almost impossible to portray!) it may not have turned out perfectly but meh. I knew from the start I was never gonna be the best out there. That's a job for Tumblr's thusforexample they are my favourite! I think more than anything, I just wanted to emphasise Dennis' soft spot for Lonny! Hope you liked it! ","Summary":" Hey guys!

Things were different at The Bourbon Room once everyone was gone. The noise was gone, the lights were out; just Lonny and Dennis until the sun came up and another busy night began. They usually didn't make it home because of the combined reasons of Dennis and his 'un-rock n' roll' taxes, both of them being too beat to make it back down the stairs and out to Dennis' truck, and Lonny lunging at his lover after a long night of drinking. It had always been that way -minus Lonny lunging, which was relatively new and it had just become a normal thing rather than a bad habit. \"Dennis, you never put anything good on!\" Lonny got up angrily, switching of the jukebox. \"Hey,\" Dennis snapped back, \"That was a good album.\" \"Yeah, well excuse me if I've gotten bloody tired of hearing the same bloody thing for the past eight years.\" \"At least it's not Phil Collins.\" \"Oh, Jesus…\" Lonny shook his head. He mentioned once that he thought Phil Collins does rock sometimes and he never heard the end of that one. Lonny gave up on the Jukebox and went to the stack of records on a shelf beside Dennis' desk, \"You need new records, mate.\" \"Why? So I can hear the same music I hear all night?\" \"Oi, I thought you loved the bands we get here!\" \"I never said I didn't,\" Dennis put his glass down on the coffee table, \"here,\" he waved Lonny back over to the couch. \"Come here. We don't need music,\" he topped off both their glasses and put his arm around Lonny's shoulders once he sat down. Lonny was usually the one arguing when Dennis turned the music off to focus on paperwork, but if Dennis wanted to 'cuddle' on the couch (they both hated that word. It was not in part of male vocabulary) then Lonny wouldn't argue. It was actually nice; no one yelling, no paperwork, no television, nothing but them for a change. They sat in silence, just listening to each other breathing and drinking what was left in their glasses. Lonny soon found himself running his finger across one of Dennis' big red ring and smiled. \"So you're serious about this?\" Dennis said after watching him for a bit. \"About what?\" Lonny put his hand down, realizing how stupid that might have looked. \"About us,\" Dennis put his glass back down, making Lonny sit up when he leaned forward. \"What the hell gave you the idea I wasn't, mate? Did I seem a bit iffy when I went down on you last time?\" Lonny lunged forward for a kiss, but Dennis stopped him. \"Wait, I wanna talk about this.\" \"What's there to talk about?\" Lonny pulled his knees under him for better balance, \"I've been madly in love with you for as long as… maybe even forever for that-\" \"Yeah, I know.\" Dennis grinned, despite the fact that Lonny was making it very hard for him to make his point. \"But?\" Lonny waited with concerned look on his face. \"Are you serious about this?\" he backed away, his heart beginning to pound out of his chest. \"Oh,\" Dennis looked at him, \"you know I am!\" Lonny relaxed, letting out a long breath. \"Then what's the problem mate?\" \"Not a problem, just… you're you and I'm…\" Lonny could tell where this was going, but he was definitely not going to say anything to support the fact. \"Oi,\" Lonny put a hand on Dennis cheek and turned his head so they were looking at each other, \"Listen Big fella. You're not gorgeous.\" Dennis rolled his eyes and began to say something. \"Hold it, let me finish! You're not gorgeous, but you're Dennis. You've got amazing eyes,\" That was true. There were still times when Lonny found himself lost in those deep, blue eyes. \"You're the only man who can wear leopard print and you've got amazing taste in music,\" \"Not Phil Collins.\" \"Shut up,\" Lonny held back the urge to laugh, \"and now you've ruined it, but you understand what I'm trying to communicate at the moment.\" Dennis opened up again and let Lonny melt back into him where he belonged, \"And your arms, man…\" Lonny smirked, feeling Dennis' strong arms wrap around him like a warm blanket. That whole thing was sappy and incredibly un-rock n' roll, but Dennis didn't care. He bent his neck down and kissed Lonny softly; savoring this little moment they had together. \"You really think I pull off leopard print?\" Lonny scrunched up his face, \"well… you try hard enough.\" ","Summary":" Another Friday night survived, another morning clocked off on the old couch upstairs with a bottle "},{"Movie":"Rock of Ages","Title":"The Nights We Don't Remember","Author":"I-Emma-writer","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10291817","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Jesus, Den! Move your legs a bit!\" Lonny laughed as he and Dennis stumbled up the stairs. He could already tell this would be one of those nights they wouldn't remember and it was all Lonny's doing. He'd been watching Dennis all week; they'd been so busy, everything was going wrong, customers had been worse than usual and the talent was horrible to say the least. The entire staff was stressed and exhausted, but by Friday Lonny finally picked himself up and pulled a few rule breaking strings, convincing the rest of the staff to take it easy and have a few drinks while Dennis wasn't looking. Jimmy was the first, followed by Drew, Sherrie, Chico and by the end of the night everyone was happily drunk, but Dennis. He came down, ready to fire everyone down there with a drop of alcohol in their system, but Lonny made a hasty comeback with a bottle of bourbon and a few of Dennis' favourite songs, courtesy of the night's band. Once everyone left, Lonny got Dennis up from the bar, nearly breaking his back in the process and helped him up the stairs to his office. \"Lonny, Zeppelin!\" Dennis slurred and they wobbled at the top of the stairs like two drunken sailors. He was like a sack of flour and Lonny fell against the wall in an attempt to reach Dennis' pants pocket. \"The keys, Den! First I need the keys!\" He laughed and tried to stop Dennis' hand from crushing his collarbone. They tumbled into the office and Lonny helped Dennis to the couch, making sure that he was gonna stay there and pushing all the old newspapers on the seat cushions to the floor. \"There, now just stay!\" Lonny laughed and rummaged through the stack of records for Dennis' favourite album: Led Zeppelin II. He always listened to that one when he was drunk… and when he was sober, and when he was happy and sad and anything in between. Even Lonny had now heard it so many times that he knew every single skip of the old vinyl. He loved seeing Dennis listen to his favourite music. He wasn't like ordinary people who know their favourite songs so well that they have to sing along. It was as if every time he heard each song, it was a new experience. He closed his eyes with his head back and smiled. You'd think he was actually visualizing it as his heels tapped on the ground to the music filled with memories and emotions. Memories of Woodstock from the grooves, of good times from the wailing guitar solos, of love from the lyrics. At least that's what Lonny thought when he looked at him. The last song came to an end and the hum from the record player filled the room. This was when Dennis was his happiest. Lonny could see it in his foggy eyes. There was absolutely nothing on his mind. No taxes, no maddening customers, just- \"Lonny,\" Dennis waved a half empty bottle in front of him, \"flip it over?\" \"Right,\" Lonny nodded and got up to flip the record and music filled the room again as Dennis let out a satisfied sigh. The night went on, just the two of them listening until the music ran out and Lonny got up on his wobbly feet and flipped the record over once more. \"The last song on this side,\" Dennis put his empty bottle on the coffee table and leaned back with his eyes closed and sang the first tine under his breath, \"If the sun refused to shine…\" Lonny looked up at him, his heart pounding up to his throat. Jesus, he even sounds good drunk, Lonny thought. He swallowed and opened his mouth, \"I would still b-be loving you.\" He finished timidly with a small smile. Dennis opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling. \"That song played at my wedding,\" he laughed and rubbed his eyes gingerly with one hand. Smile gone. Ouch… \"Is that right?\" Lonny almost rolled his eyes at this late night reminiscence. He hated hearing about Dennis' past relationships, especially the one about his ex-wife who he met at Woodstock, married in the next four years and then divorced two years later. It made his stomach churn just thinking about it. He sat through the stories in silent agony, but he could never stop the jealousy from rattling around in his head. He'd never met her, but he could tell from the way Dennis talked about her that she was a snake. All he ever did was make her happy and she ever did was cost him money. Dennis didn't deserve that. \"You know, Lonny,\" Dennis chuckled and shook his head, \"I don't remember loving her.\" Lonny's hand slipped on the needle and he swore loudly as the record slipped out of his hand. \"Well, you had to, didn't you? You married her.\" He said flatly, trying to keep his anger in check. \"It wasn't because I loved her,\" Dennis' voice got lower and less cheerful, \"that's what you do. You find the girl, marry her, live happily ever after.\" Oh, how their take on that differed. Lonny probably would've laughed if anyone else had said that. \"Not true,\" Lonny said after composing himself and putting the record back, \"there's millions of people in this world, Den. How do you know you've found the right one without trying them all?\" He frowned, surprising even himself with that last bit. It must've been the alcohol. \"You don't,\" Dennis moved his legs aside for Lonny as he plopped down beside him, \"You just need to trust yourself sometimes.\" \"But, you never loved her?\" Lonny sat cross-legged, resting his back against the arm of the couch. \"No,\" Dennis shook his head, \"not like I should have.\" That was news to Lonny. He always thought that she was the love of Dennis' life in the beginning. Every time they talked about past relationships, he only ever mentioned her. Had he ever really loved anyone? \"But the sex was good, yeah?\" Lonny teased. \"Mind blowing,\" Dennis laughed back. Lonny tried to keep the mood light, but he envied Dennis in that moment. He'd fallen in love way too fast more times than he could count and now he wasn't even sure what true love was anymore. If it weren't for Dennis, he probably wouldn't even believe in true love. Dennis' heavy sigh sliced the silence and their eyes met. His eyes were full of bourbon and bad memories now. The wave of drunken happiness had died down and all that was left was a cool puddle of remorse that Lonny was dragged along into. The worst part was he knew that if Dennis let him, he could make things better, show him what love really is, but would he let him? \"Den,\" Lonny took a deep breath and leaned forward, putting his knees beneath him. This was it. This was finally it. Neither of them would remember, he knew that, but he couldn't let the moment pass. \"I want something.\" He watched Dennis stare blankly at him for a second before their lips met and just as soon as they were together, they were apart and Dennis' hand was on the back of his neck. That's all Lonny wanted, nothing that could potentially be remembered in the morning, just something to make him feel sure right now. He was looking into Dennis' eyes again, one hand on the back of the couch, one on the arm when the last bottle of bourbon finally caught up to Dennis and knocked him out. Lonny smiled and took his Dennis' hand off the back of his neck, sitting back in the chair across from the couch. He wished that when he woke up the taste of Bourbon and smoke would still be fresh on his lips and the smell of Dennis' musky cologne would still be wafting around him, but that was the beauty of the nights no one remembers. \"Sweet dreams, big fella.\" ","Summary":" \"Jesus, Den!

Here's a Lonny and Dennis oneshot I wrote out of boredom one day. I just suddenly started thinking of different scenarios where Lonny and Dennis admit they love each other. I mean, the movie version was awesome but, well. There are other ways it could've been done. Constructive criticism welcomed (anything to improve my writing) Enjoy! Dennis slammed the phone down angrily. Great. Yet another thing to make this the worst day ever. His girlfriend had broken up with him. On Valentine's Day. Over the phone. Truthfully speaking, he didn't actually like her. But dating her was better than pining for Lonny all the time. Plus, not having a date on Valentine's Day was kind of pathetic. It was just another thing to add to the long list of problems and disasters Dennis was currently facing. He'd ignored the taxes for far too long and now the real estate would be reclaimed if he couldn't repay everything by midnight tomorrow night. The gig he'd had lined up had backed out, and he couldn't find anybody else on such short notice. Of course, he wouldn't have such a huge problem if it wasn't for Paul Gill, who stole all of the profits of Arsenal's last show after promising the gig was a freebie. He supposed it was partly Stacee's fault as well, but that guy was barely coherent off stage, and when he was he didn't make any sense (what the hell did a fire phoenix have to do with anything?) so it was hard for Dennis to believe that Stacee had knowingly allowed Paul to steal money from his rock and roll brother... but you never could tell with rock gods. He heard the door of the Bourbon slam with such force it made him jump. Not even Lonny was supposed to come into work for another two hours. Not that he'd figured Lonny'd show up for work anyway since it was Valentine's Day and, unlike Dennis, he probably had a date. He stuck his head out of the office and to his surprise, he saw Lonny sulking near the bar. \"You ok man?\" Dennis asked. Lonny shook his head. \"What's up? I figured you wouldn't turn up for work since it was Valentine's Day and you probably had a date.\" \"What's the point in dating when the one you fancy's already taken?\" Lonny replied glumly. Dennis raised his eyebrows. He knew the feeling all too well. But this wasn't like Lonny at all. Dennis had never seen Lonny upset over a girl before. As he walked over to the bar, he couldn't help but notice Lonny's tear-stained cheeks. \" Damn. He's definitely got it bad for some lucky girl.\" Dennis thought sadly. He wasn't good with these kinds of situations. He would've done anything to see Lonny smile again, but he kept his distance. After all, this wasn't the best time to reveal his feelings. \"Can I have something to do to take my mind off it?\" Lonny asked, \"A toilet to unclog maybe?\" Dennis nodded, still trying to think of a way to make his friend feel better. \"Shauna broke up with me. Over the phone.\" He said casually. Lonny was quiet for a moment. \"When?\" He asked. \"About five minutes ago.\" Dennis replied. \"I'm Sorry Den. I really am. I know how much you liked her.\" \"I didn't like her at all actually. I was just trying to take my mind off someone else.\" \"Oh.\" Was all Lonny could say. \"So, who is it you like?\" Dennis asked. \"Oh uh, just someone from work.\" Dennis frowned. He'd need time to think about who it could be. \"Well, it's your lucky day. The toilet is blocked. Plunger's behind the bar.\" Dennis turned and headed back up to the office. Lonny bit his lip. Should he say something? \"Dennis?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Um, if you're not too busy... maybe we could go out somewhere or something? I mean, it is Valentine's Day.\" He tried to make it sound like he was joking, when in reality his heart was practically pounding out of his chest. Dennis stared at Lonny for a moment. He looked too nervous to be joking. \"Who do you like?\" He asked quietly, hopefully. Lonny hung his head. \"God, you guessed that pretty quickly. So much for the casual approach.\" He smiled sadly. Dennis gulped. It couldn't be. No, Lonny couldn't be serious! \" Now or never.\" Dennis told himself. \"I dated Shauna to get my mind off of someone. My best friend actually.\" He held his breath, waiting for Lonny's response. Lonny raised his eyebrows. \"Who's your best- oh... wait. Me? You dated her to take your mind off me?\" He asked. Dennis nodded. They stared at each other for a long moment. Then Lonny caught Dennis by surprise by letting out a whoop of enthusiasm and crashing into Dennis' arms. \"You're serious right? You're not joking or anything?\" Dennis chuckled. \"No, I'm not joking. And, if your offer still stands, I know this great little Italian place about two blocks from here.\" Lonny grinned. They left the Bourbon and their worries of taxes and lack of gigs behind as they focused for the next few hours on the one thing they'd always wanted, and it seemed they always had. Each other.

I just sudden"},{"Movie":"Rock of Ages","Title":"Fairplay","Author":"I-Emma-writer","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9679237","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The sunset strip; the place for sex, drugs, and rock n' roll, it didn't get any dirtier than that. At least that what Lonny thought until he lurched forward and emptied his stomach into a smelly garbage can, half full of vomit already. Lovely. He winced, hearing the piercing screams from the top of the roller coaster again and held Dennis' shoulder to stay up. Carnivals were definitely not and would never again be on his rock n' roll agenda. \"Smells like a dog shat in there,\" he wiped his bottom lip and took his aviators back from Dennis, who had picked them up after Lonny dropped them in his mad dash for the bin. Dennis laughed and pat Lonny's shoulder sympathetically as his friend leaned over again and spewed out all the cotton candy he had eaten. He couldn't help but feel a bit bad for suggesting the roller coaster as the first ride, but Lonny didn't say anything when they were in line. \"You should've told me you didn't want to go one that one,\" \"It's not that I-ugh… didn't want to!\" Lonny said, trying to sound less pathetic. It was half true. Lonny always got sick. Whether it was a plane, boat, ever a car if it was a rough ride, but Dennis talked him into it. Actually, he was doing all of this for Dennis. Lonny hated carnivals, being the night creature he was, but here he was with his boss on a hot afternoon, surrounded by screaming kids and the smell of greasy food making him feel even sicker. It all started early Sunday morning, after they closed and the last few people were trickling out the door from the previous night. It had been a busy night and Chico and Lonny stayed back to help clean up. While they took care of things, Dennis was counting money from the register at the bar. He had actually been talking about buying some new equipment for the stage with all the money they had been making this summer. Of course they needed some plumbing fixed and a new lock for the storeroom door, but an amp was way more important than that shit. \"DENNIS… DENNIS!\" He was interrupted by a strained, annoying scream that could only be coming from one person. \"Yes, Lonny?\" Dennis yelled back after a huge sigh. \"Get in here!\" He rolled his eyes, slammed the drawer shut and marched in the men's room. \"What do you-\" he stopped as soon as he got in and closed his eyes, trying to respond as calmly as he could to what he had just seen. \"God dammit, Lonny, you couldn't wait until after your piss?\" \"NO! LOOK!\" Lonny –Who was standing, legs apart in front of a urinal—twisted around and held out a tattered Rolling Stone magazine he was reading, \"page thirteen, read the headline!\" Dennis gave Lonny an irritated look and flipped open the magazine. His face went blank. He didn't like what he saw. Right there in big black letters: STEEL JIZZ CALLS IT QUITS \"Well,\" Dennis took a second to think about how much they depended on the band, \"there goes another one,\" \"That's not it, mate,\" Lonny zipped up his pants and walked up to Dennis briskly, \"Steel Jizz were supposed to be here on Thursday night!\" Dennis stared at Lonny for a second, almost too long. Lonny was starting to get that tingling feeling he felt in his stomach whenever Dennis stared into his eyes too long. \"Are you sure?\" Dennis narrowed his eyes and looked as though he was searching into Lonny's for the answer. Lonny shook his head, refocusing on the problem, \"Yeah, Den. Check your books!\" Lonny huffed and caught the magazine as Dennis pushed it against his chest and put it back where he found it. \"Shit,\" He heard Dennis grunt from outside. Lonny shook his head and couldn't help but laugh. Ever since he was promoted to management, he'd really put an effort into staying on top of things and at times like these, it paid off. \"What would you do without me?\" He jumped up on the bar, a new XXX magazine tucked under his arm. \"Don't stress, man,\" he opened the magazine and chuckled at Dennis' unenthusiastic expression, \"Steel Jizz was bound to release at some time.\" Dennis went from unenthusiastic to annoyed. \"Alright, maybe they had a premature ejaculation,\" \"Knock it off!\" Dennis slapped the magazine out of Lonny's hand and walked past him. \"Oi, oi! Den, where the hell are you going?\" Lonny fumbled the magazine, swung his legs off the bar and watched Dennis, \"Dennis!\" He hopped down and followed Dennis up to his office, almost running into Chico on the way there. He slid to a halt in front of the door and caught it as Dennis was about to slam it shut. He was used to Dennis slamming doors and ignoring him by now, so he just went with it. \"We have twelve hours. Lonny, give me names all the bands we've had. Who can we get on short notice?\" \"What about new bands?\" \"We don't have time.\" Lonny hated doing this, if there was one thing he hated it was… well, Monday and randomly calling out bands while Dennis refused band after band after band... He sighed and flopped down on the couch, \"Alan Park and the Penetrators?\" \"No, not good enough…\" \"Drool?\" \"Nah,\" \"Why not?\" \"Too expensive,\" \"Well, I don't exactly think beggars can be choosers in this sort of situation, Den!\" Lony shouted, getting frustrated with how picky Dennis was being, \"We don't have a lot of time if you've forgotten!\" Dennis took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down and –though it was hard when he was stressed—tried to push Lonny out of his mind and focus. \"I'm calling Titty Shocker,\" Dennis finally decided and picked up the phone. \"Oh, brilliant,\" Lonny said sarcastically, \"oi, don't forget what they did here last time they were here.\" Dennis paused, \"with the llama?\" \"I believe it was an alpaca, yes…\" Dennis made a disappointed face and put the phone back down. This was gonna be a long night. \"Lonny,\" Lonny felt a rough hand on his shoulder, \"Lonny, wake up.\" He blinked awake and rubbed his eyes. \"Jesus, what time is it?\" he groaned, his voice croaky and his word slurred from the pounding in his head. Too many drink again. He looked at Dennis briefly and shoved his head under his pillow, inhaling the smell of leather and beer on the couch. \"It's eleven thirty,\" Dennis said with a strained grunt as he got up and walked around the coffee table. \"Kill me,\" Lonny mumbled, holding the pillow on his head. This was way too early to even be thinking about being awake. \"Lonny, get up,\" Dennis turned on the TV sat on the edge of the couch, \"I got a band.\" \"Mmm? Well done, mate. Knew you would…\" He peaked out from under the pillow and looked at the coffee table in front of him. On it was Dennis' glass of Bourbon from the night before, a new bottle of Jack Daniel's whiskey and a bag of gummy worms in the wooden bowl that was supposed to be for Dennis' keys and pocket change until Lonny claimed it for his candy. Dennis must have gone out before Lonny woke up to get all this. \"How long have you been up?\" Lonny groaned as he stretched his arms and legs. \"A few hours,\" Dennis half-glared at Lonny, \"thanks for your help last night.\" Lonny laughed and hit Dennis with his knee, \"You didn't need me, Den. I knew you'd sort it out,\" \"You fell asleep on the job,\" \"I was fucking exhausted,\" \"Mhm,\" Dennis laughed. He shuffled through a stack of newspaper and handed Lonny a flyer, \"here. We're going to this today.\" Lonny squinted at the brightly coloured flyer and laughed, sitting up to get a better look, \"A carnival? You're fucking with me, Den. You don't exactly strike me a carnival enthusiast.\" \"The Bourbon is doing a promotion for it, so I thought I'd check it out. I got two of these,\" Dennis tossed Lonny a ticket and sat at his desk. \"Go home and…\" Dennis took a look Lonny in his dishevelled, hungover state, \"deal with that and meet me by the Ferris wheel at 2:30.\" \"Den, can't we go somewhere else?\" Lonny whined. Dennis put his head down in his work and glared at Lonny from under his furrowed brow, \"Punishment for falling asleep. Ferris wheel, 2:30.\" Lonny sighed, a combination of hate and love. He hated carnivals ever since his first girlfriend back in London dumped 15-year-old Lonny after meeting the guy who sold candy apples. He was bitter about that for a long time and hadn't been to a carnival since, but he loved going out with Dennis. They didn't do much outside The Bourbon Room walls. Lonny thought it was to keep the boss/employee border, which he understood, but every now and then they would go see a movie or go out for dinner at any hole-in-the-wall restaurant that was open at 3:00am just to bend the border out a little. Today however, that border was smashed to piece as they tried to beat each other at mini golf later that day. Turns out Lonny was super competitive, but had no idea what he was doing and was ready to throw a fit by the fourth hole if Dennis laughed at him one more time. Dennis was lucky he had a rough chuckle that was just making him hotter by the second. \"Stop laughing, I'm doing my best!\" Lonny felt his face turn red as he lined up for another putt. \"Let me help you out, you're doing it wrong,\" Dennis said over Lonny's shoulder and grabbed his hips, turning Lonny's body slightly. \"Whoa, D-Den, what are you-\" \"Relax, no one's watching,\" he put a hand on one of Lonny's knees and jerked his legs apart, sending his heart racing. \"Loosen up and tap it lightly,\" Dennis pressed up against him, making his back straighten. Jesus, if he only knew… Lonny thought as he tried to keep himself under control. Dennis could probably feel his heart beating and his whole body trembling. He brought his hands back slowly and hit the ball, sinking it in the hole on the first swing. There was a second of silence between them and Lonny thought his jeans were gonna bust if Dennis stood behind him any longer, (Although he wasn't worried about that, he had developed many techniques for covering up the Little Lonny) but he stood there. Almost scared to move, feeling Dennis' breath on the back of his neck. \"How was that?\" Lonny finally turned his head and asked timidly. Dennis looked back at him, and for a split second Lonny swore he saw a smirk pulling at the corner of his mouth as their eyes met. \"Pretty good,\" Dennis backed away and got his golf ball from the hole, \"let's keep going.\" And so began –ironically- the best day of Lonny's entire life. The first half of the day was completely forgotten and all Lonny could remember was letting Dennis –again—talk him into riding the carousel and playing the milk bottle game until they were out of tickets. It wasn't until the carnival was closing for the night when they walked back to Dennis' truck with a pink cloud of cotton candy and a green stuffed frog Dennis won. Lonny hadn't even had a drink yet, but the excitement of the day had him talking Dennis' ear off all the way to the parking lot. \"…and, you know,\" Lonny pulled on the sleeve of Dennis' Kiss t-shirt, \"This is the first time I've not seen you in sleeves and a vest. This should be a date marked in history,\" \"I didn't know you cared,\" \"I didn't know you had arms!\" Lonny laughed out loud and leaned against the front of the truck. He looked down as a bashful little smile crept across his face. He hated to admit that he had fun after complaining so much that morning, but he couldn't deny it. And Dennis looked so happy and relaxed right now, it was worth every second and every dollar they spent. Lonny smiled the whole way home. From the moment they left to when they were in front of his place with the radio humming lowly and the noise of the city dying down outside. \"Here,\" Dennis picked up the stuffed frog and gave it to Lonny before he got out. \"Take this,\" he said bluntly and shrugged, \"It's no glass of whiskey but thanks. I had fun.\" Again, one other things Dennis thought nothing of, but meant everything to Lonny. This was a new side of Dennis that Lonny had seen for the first time; he had fun, he was completely relaxed and was actually thanking Lonny for something. If only Lonny could return the favour… now would've been a perfect time, a scene right out of a movie: the sun setting, the radio in the background, in a rusty old pickup. But he couldn't. Dennis had no idea, why would he? They were friends and nothing more. Correcting Lonny's swing and this stupid frog meant nothing, and Lonny loved him too much to let his stupid feelings ruin what they had. He smiled one last time, taking the frog and ducking out of the truck. As much as he wanted to grab Dennis by the collar of his faded t-shirt and kiss him or bring him inside for something more, he couldn't.

You only have the length of the song to finish the drabble, (I'm currently praying for some ten minute tracks) No lingering after the song is finished, and no cheating (oops). This sounded like fun so I had to try it. :D Don't you forget about me (Are you kidding me right now?!) Dennis watched sadly as Lonny flirted with a couple of girls. It was getting to be a more and more common occurrence. Constance walked over and sat down next to him at the bar, but her eyes were on Stacee. He had a horde of groupies around him, and seemed to be flirting with all of them. Lonny caught Dennis' eye and grinned. \"Love you.\" He mouthed. Dennis smiled weakly. \"I know.\" He mouthed back, \"You too.\" Stacee caught sight of Constance and smiled. \"Love you.\" He mouthed. Constance grinned. \"You too.\" Under pressure (Oh for crying out loud) Dennis sat at the desk in the office, surrounded by stacks of paperwork. He sighed audibly, knowing that it would get on Lonny's nerves. Lonny looked up from the couch. He'd been thumbing through an old issue of Rolling Stone magazine. He smiled sympathetically. He walked over with a devious smirk and sat down on Dennis' lap, ready to kiss it all better. Boogie Fever (GAAAHHH $$$%%^#$$^&*^% F****) Lonny snuck into the office and looked around. Nobody home. He smiled with relief and pulled a record out from under the couch. He put it on and grinned. Although he would never admit it, he kind of had a thing for disco music. (This is kinda OOC but come on! It's a hard song.) Theme from CHiPS (The universe hates me) Lonny grinned. Dennis groaned. The one thing they could never agree on was Lonny's love for cop shows. Smooth operator (Kill me. Please. Just kill me) Constance sat at home (Stacee's mansion) Stacee was out with another girl, she just knew it. God, she hated that guy. But he was smooth. He was Stacee Jaxx, and it was her he came home to at the end of the day. Still, he was an asshole. (Again, OOCish. Sorry) The Clap (I'm laughing right now) Constance moved away when Stacee began to kiss her neck. \"We um, we can't, baby. Not tonight.\" He frowned. \"Why not?\" \"I uh, I have the clap. I got it off a um, toilet seat.\" Stacee grinned. \"So did I.\" Smooth criminal (Alien Ant Farm cover. No really.) Sherrie was at home, alone. Drew was out for a few drinks with the guys, and shed assure him she'd be fine on her own. Now she wasn't so sure. Every little noise was making her jump. It was 1AM, where the hell was Drew? The door opened and she shrieked in fear, but it was Lonny, of all people. \"You alright love? Drew wanted me to check in on you.\" \"Why you?\" She asked. \"Cos everyone else is completely pissed, and it takes a lot more than a few shots to get me drunk. He probably won't be home until dawn, if that.\" She nodded. \"You scared the hell out of me.\" (I'm sorry. This is a hard song) 9 to 5 (please don't ask why I have this on my playlist) Dennis cringed and pulled Lonny's arm off him as he got up. 5 o'clock in the evening was definitely the worst part of his day. Lonny got up an hour later, cringing just as Dennis did, and frowned longingly at the empty space next to him. 6 o'clock was the worst part of his day. Bright eyes (…. Don't judge me. I like bunny rabbits) Lonny stared at the last page of the book sadly. It had ended in a strange way. Happy yet sad at the same time. The door to the office burst open and Lonny tossed the book under the couch. \"Alright Den?\" He said a little too enthusiastically. \"Fine…\" \"Good! Well, um, I'm headed downstairs now.\" He muttered before running off. Dennis looked under the couch and smirked at the book. Watership Down. November Rain (eight glorious minutes) Lonny stumbled out of the Bourbon after his fight with Dennis. He barely remembered what the fight was about. He just remembered how much Dennis' words had stung. He walked through the rain, blinded by tears, half hoping he would be hit by a truck. He suddenly felt uncertain hands on his shoulders. \"Lonny?\" Dennis said quietly. \"Den?\" Lonny asked hopefully as he turned around. Dennis pulled him in for a hug. \"I'm sorry Lon. I'm so sorry. I love you, so much.\" \"I love you too.\" I was only gonna do ten of these but I guess I'm doing twenty… For this chapter anyway. I might add to it when I get bored… Crocodile rock (-_-) Dennis sat in the office with Lonny. \"Tell me about your ex-girlfriend.\" Lonny said suddenly. \"Which one?\" \"The first one.\" \"Oh, Susie. She left me for some foreign guy, but I'll never forget those Friday nights… when she wore those tight dresses…\" Lonny grinned. He would never stop loving the way Dennis looked when he reminisced. Go to hell (this shouldn't be too hard) Constance picked up her suitcase and stormed out of Stacee's mansion. \"Connie, wait!\" \"Go to hell Stacee.\" \"Let's talk about this!\" \"About what? How good that stripper was in bed?\" \"It was an accident!\" \"Uh huh. Your pants just magically fell off?\" \"We can work through this!\" \"Go to hell Stacee!\" :( now I'm sad… Somebody to love (Ok, now we're getting somewhere) Dennis sighed, exhausted. He'd been working non-stop at paperwork for five days straight. He'd barely seen Lonny, barely eaten, and he hadn't been home at all. He was dreading coming home to an empty apartment and finding out that Lonny had run off with Joey Primo, or worse… could it even get any worse? He opened the door to the apartment and found Lonny asleep on the couch. He woke up as soon as Dennis touched his cheek. \"You're home!\" Lonny yelled, pulling Dennis in for a kiss, \"I missed you.\" Dennis smiled, grateful to have somebody to love (Oh so cheesy) Twisted Nerve (a one minute track? Really?) Lonny whistled under his breath annoyingly. Dennis cringed. \"Lonny.\" Dennis said after a moment. \"Yeah Den?\" Lonny replied. \"Shut up.\" Footloose (Facepalm) Dennis' absolute favourite part of the night was watching Lonny dance after a round of shots. Words could not describe it. (LAME) Barbie girl (F***************************************) Dennis rummaged through the boxes in the office, looking for a record. He frowned and pulled a Barbie Doll out of the box. \"Lonny, what the hell is this?\" Lonny smiled and turned red in the face. \"Oh. Funny story.\" \"…I don't want to know.\" Dennis said after a moment. Radio Gaga Lonny frowned. He was sitting at the bar, with the radio next to him, going through the stations. \"Shit, shite, crap, oh for Christssake.\" Whip it (…I'm ashamed. Very ashamed.) All I can think of is flower pots… And Lonny wearing one on his head… is that good enough for you people? Nurse Rozetta (This is a teen book now) Stacee sat in a padded cell. He'd been admitted for alcoholism, but he'd attacked a couple of people (while drunk) and earned some solitary confinement. The door opened and a sexy blonde nurse entered. \"Are you gonna be good now?\" She asked, pushing her glasses further up onto her nose. He nodded stupidly. \"Good. I'm Constance.\" \"Stacee.\" He muttered. It was either this or Lonny in a nurses uniform. That's too weird even for me. Before we do the last one, I have a confession to make. I skipped a few songs. I skipped all the ones already in ROA for obvious reasons, but there are a couple of songs, Crazy frog, Word up, That I just couldn't do anything with. Don't judge me! This is hard! I also spent a really long time flicking through to get the last song. Why? Cos it's the last one! Girls just wanna have fun. Sherrie, Constance and Lonny stumbled into the Bourbon, drunk and laughing like maniacs. Drew, Stacee and Dennis turned around. They'd been sitting at the bar, still in the process of actually getting reasonably drunk. \"Wow, you two were right, blondes do have more fun!\" Lonny yelled. \"I think girls in general have more fun.\" Constance replied. \"I wouldn't be so sure.\" Dennis muttered.

Implied Slash. Set after the Z-Guyeez show (Did I spell that right?) but before the Arsenal and Von Colt concert. Enjoy! Drew and I got our old jobs at the Bourbon back. Stacee got back together with Arsenal and is pretty eager to go on tour with Von Colt, surprisingly. Until then, it's back to being a barmaid. Still, at least Dennis was nice enough to actually give us our old jobs back, but he's been in a pretty good mood lately. And it doesn't take a genius to see why. Take last night for example. Drew and I showed up for work at the usual time. Apart from Lonny and Dennis, we were the first workers there since I hate being late. When we got there Lonny was sitting cross-legged on top of the bar, whispering something into Dennis' ear that had them laughing their heads off. For the rest of the night, every time they walked past each other, they held hands for a split second before walking on. When Lonny was at the bar, Dennis talked to him for ages and didn't notice when I told him there'd been a mishap with the beer delivery. He noticed hours later and asked me why I didn't say anything. At ten thirty, Lonny gets an hour long break. Most workers go to the Record shop down the street or go home to get a change of clothes. Some workers even go to the Venus Club where I used to dance, But not Lonny. Lonny's never left the Bourbon on his break. At ten thirty on the dot, Lonny went over to Dennis and said something, I'm not sure what, and they both retreated to the office. Lonny never gets back from his break on time. At around twelve, when the club was slowly winding down, Lonny and Dennis got a lot more affectionate. It's almost like they forgot everyone could see them. Too much drink probably. It's Dennis who started it, funnily enough. He leaned against the bar and kissed Lonny whenever he walked past and Dennis was sure nobody was watching. They're never discreet, although they like to think they are. By now, everyone's guessed about they're relationship. At two AM, the club closed and Lonny and Dennis headed back up to the office. Dennis is determined never to get behind on taxes again. By four AM, Drew and I clocked off and headed up to the office to say goodbye. We had the same conversation we've had with Dennis every night at the Bourbon since I started working here. \"Bye Dennis. Don't stay up too late ok?\" Dennis smiled. \"Yeah. I should probably get this one home anyway.\" He motioned to Lonny, who was asleep on the couch with half a gummy worm in his hand. Lonny has always been one of those rare people who can sleep (or maybe pass out, I can never be sure) just about anywhere. When I first started working at the Bourbon, I found him backstage, where the music was so loud I had to cover my ears, snoring his head off. \"Poor Lonny.\" I said. Dennis rolled his eyes. \"Yeah. Doing nothing all night must be exhausting.\" He said with a grin. So there you have it. I don't know how, and I don't know when, but at some point after Drew and I left the Bourbon, Lonny and Dennis got together. Of course, I think it's fantastic. Lonny's done wonders for Dennis' mood, plus everyone agrees it's a match made in heaven.

But the story doesn't end there. What happens next? Hi, I know I should finish my other stories instead of starting another one. (Because by the way I never finish stories) But I really love Wild Child and wanted to do a story. Okay so I'll hardly update because I want to focus on my other stories but I'll try as hard as possible to finish this. Stick with me. I'm thinking this will have maybe 15 chapters but it could be more or less. So it's the same Freddie and Poppy pairing. Just carried on after the film. It's Poppy's last day before summer break. Ellie xx No one's POV Poppy Moore had been at Abbey Mount for 7 months, 4 days and 7 hours (Note: I don't know how long she was there so... I guessed. Forgive me.) And if you asked her she could probaly say how many minutes and seconds she had been there also. Poppy Moore was a good, kind girl who was one of the most amazing friends you could have. She was bright with a wonderful future ahead of her. That wasn't how it had always been of cause. She had to start with been wild and untamed with about as much respect for anyone other than herself as a human has for wasps. She was sent to Abbey Mount a boarding school in England for girls aged 11 to 18 after she ruined her father's girlfriend's belongings in an outrageous prank. Her father could take no more and sent her to Abbey Mount. She hadn't wanted to be taken to the school and wanted to get expelled. With the help of her dorm mates Kate, Camilla, Jennifer and Josie she tried many pranks to get her expelled from the school. After these pranks failed they eventually decided that Poppy would have to kiss the headteacher Mrs Kingsley's son Freddy who was forbidden to fraternize with the girls at the school. Poppy ends up falling for Freddie and becoming friends with her dorm mates. But Harriet a girl who loved Freddy herself hated Poppy and sellotaped fake emails on Freddy's and Poppy's dorm mates doors. Poppy was devastated and feeling very angry after a conversation with her former best friend set fire to a towel. Poppy put the fire out but hearing footsteps fled the scene. The fire was restarted and Poppy took the blame. She was nearly expelled until Harriet made a slip and it was uncovered that it wasn't Poppy who started the fire. Her friends found out she hadn't sent the emails and everything seemed to fit perfectly in place... Poppy's POV I sat on the bench in front of school and stared out across the grounds. It seems weird to think I've been here for 7 months. But even weirder to think I'd wanted to get out of here. Now it felt like home and as much as I wanted to see LA again I didn't want to leave. The reason however was not that I'd suddenly developed a liking for the mush they called food. The stupid rules about lights out and phones. The hidious uniforms. Or the stupidly small dorm rooms we had to share. The reason was Freddy. The girls were going to be visiting LA for 3 weeks of the holidays and possibly longer if my dad managed to charm their parents a little more than he already had. My father was proud of me and seeing my improvement let me have anything. My anything was having the girls stay. My father wouldn't stretch as far as to let me have a boy though. I wouldn't see Freddy for 6 weeks and that was far too long for me. \"What a pleasant surprise it is to see you trouble,\" I heard a male voice from behind me shocking me out of my thoughts. I looked up to see Freddy himself staring down at me. I shuffled up the bench to let himsit down. \"Why yes it is Fredster. I'm barely able to contain my joy,\" I rolled my eyes and he chuckled quietly. \"Try to contain your happiness there. Don't go to over the top,\" He smiled and cupped my face. He gently brought his lips to mine and he gave me a soft kiss. It was so soft I barely felt it. Just the brushing of our lips moving together. Even though the kiss was hardly there I still felt it burning on my lips. Making me feel raw and full of tingles that ran down my spine. He always make me feel so open. Like when he was with me he'd find out anything I hid from him (not that I ever hid anything from him) or any lie (and I didn't lie to him either). He pulled away and smiled. He stroked my cheek with his thumb and stared into my eyes. \"Oh I'll try. But it'll be hard,\" I smiled at him and he dropped my face deciding to select a strand of my hair and twist it around his finger instead. \"You're beautiful you know that,\" He wasn't focusing on my eyes anymore but the piece of hair curled around his finger. He let the strand go and it went falling back onto the side of my neck. \"Beatiful? Oh I know,\" I grinned. He laughed and tickled my sides making me laugh as well. \"How am I going to last 6 whole weeks without you trouble. My life's so boring without you,\" He sighed and put an arm around me. \"I don't know. I do liven things up don't I. Well you could still come to LA. But I'd need to beg my dad. And...\" I trailed off realizing his mother would never let him come. \"There's my mum,\" He finished for me. I nodded sadly. \"You could try and talk to her. Tell me if there's any luck. I still have an hour here,\" I sighed. \"I think we'll need a lot of luck and wishes for her to let me go,\" He shook his head. \"You can still try,\" I stated shortly. \"For you I will. For you I'll try,\" He kissed me on the forehead before getting up and walking back into the school. I watched him go until he was finally in school. Then I took out my phone and called my dad's number. Freddy's POV I knew there was more chance that aliens would invade, zombies would take over, pigs would fly, there'd be singing lions named Simba and Nala who prowled down the street and that Edward Cullen would marry Jacob Black (all in one day as well) than my mum would let me go to LA. But I'd try anyway. I was standing outside my mum's office. Pacing back and fourth trying to get up the courage to knock. I didn't need to though. The door opened revealing my mother. \"Come in Freddy honey,\" She stepped away from the door to let me get past then sat back down in the chair behind her desk. \"Mum. Can I go to LA to see Poppy in the holidays?\" I asked taking a seat opposite her. \"No. You know you shouldn't be fraternizing with the girls. Poppy is finally on track and I don't want to leading her astray,\" My mum shook her head and put her hands on her desk. \"But mum I really like her. I may even be in love with h-\" My mum put a hand up to silence me. \"What? In love with her? But Freddy darling what would happen when school starts again. Poppy will have important exams as will you and seeing her in the holidays would lead the feelings on. Make them bigger and it'd be all the more hard to leave her,\" She said to me. I could she she was trying to reason with me. Let me down gently. \"I know. But I'll still get good grades. As will Poppy. I care about Poppy very much. She's one of the most important people to me and I can't be without her. Please mum. Please,\" I begged. \"Okay. On one condition,\" For a second I thought I'd heard her wrong. Okay? Really? Oh my god. \"Yes. Anything. Just name it mum,\" I knew I was smiling insanely now. But I didn't care. \"If your's or Poppy's grades drop you'll move into your own school. You'll have no weekends for 3 months and you won't be able to come to the school,\" She told me and I nodded to everything. \"Deal. Thank you so much. I love you mum. You're the best,\" Then I got up and left her office. Poppy's POV \"But daddy it'll be okay,\" I said into my phone and heard my father's yelled no in response, \"Daddy I understand but I love him and I need to see him.\" \"Poppy I know what you're like,\" My father sighed impatiently. \"Correction. What I used to be like. And plus I'm still a virgin,\" I told him. \"Nice to know Poppy but...\" I interrupted him. \"I know. I know. But pleaseee,\" I begged. \"Okay. But be on best behaviour or he's on the next flight home,\" My dad gave in and I found myself smiling. \"I love you so much daddy,\" I shrieked. \"I love you too Pops,\" And then he hung up. \"So you love me hey trouble?\" I turned to see Freddy just as I was shoving my phone into my pocket. \"Oh... Um... Well yeah,\" I stuttured looking down at my knees and blushing slightly. \"I love you too,\" He smiled and sat next to me. \"So what did your mum say?\" I asked and looked back at him. He was smiling which I took as a good sign. \"She said I could come. But if either of our grades dropped I'll move into my own school. I'll have no weekends for 3 months and I won't be able to come to the school,\" He took my hand and cupped it in his lap. \"That's good. My dad said you could come as well. If I'm on best behaviour,\" I shrugged slightly. He nodded. \"So I guess I'm off to LA,\" He grinned. \"I guess you are,\" I nodded. Please review. It means a lot and it'll help me keep going. I'll love you if you do. And thanks for reading.[Chapter 2] Hey, Well I didn't get any reviews *sob sob* (I am like crying right now :'[)Okay so I hope you liked my first chapter (maybe you couldn't be arsed to review? Hope so) as much as I liked writing it (and I did). But I'll try and update as much as possible (and to anyone that's reading my other stories I'll try to update). But now on with the story. E xxx Kate's POV I sat on the end of my bed in the dorm after checking that I'd got everything. I was going to miss the school for the 6 weeks we'd be apart. I'd miss everything about it here. This is my home now. This will always be my home. I heard voices outside and a girl laughing. I got up to answer the door and as I got closer I heard it was Poppy and Freddy. \"Don't. Stop it. You know I h-\" Poppy was squealing before she irrupted into giggles. \"But you sound so cute when you laugh,\" Freddy chuckled. Then I heard the giggling stop and I knew they were kissing. I waited a couple of minutes for the voices to start up again before opening the door so I wouldn't disturb them. When Poppy started speaking again I turned the door knob and they both looked at me. \"Hey Kate. I thought you were going to wait outside for me while I got everything,\" Poppy frowned slightly before shrugging. \"Oh I just had to make sure we hadn't forgotten anything. Our trunks and stuff are all over there on Drippy's bed. And plus I thought you'd need help carrying everything,\" I smiled at her. \"Oh thanks Kate. My dad's finally let Freddy come to LA,\" She grinned at me. \"Oh god,\" I groaned, \"Now we'll have to put up with you two being all... Ugh.\" \"Sorryyy,\" She laughed before kissing Freddy on the cheek and telling him to wait outside for us. Freddy smiled and said goodbye to us both before retreatind down the corridor and out of sight. Poppy who was watching him go turned to me. \"I can't believe he's coming to LA,\" She grinned as she crept past me and into the room. \"You won't be too loved up will you?\" I asked as I closed the door. \"We'll try not to,\" She laughed and sat on the bed, \"Guess what. We said that we loved each other for the first time.\" \"Wow. That's awesome Poppy. You're telling us everything later. But we need to hurry up. I told Kiki and Josie to wait outside for us,\" I grabbed two trunk and hoisted them up off the floor. Poppy took the other two and we both struggled our way out of the room. \"Where's Drippy?\" Poppy asked as we shuffled along the corridor. \"She's gone to get a wagon wheel,\" I shrugged. \"Should of guessed,\" She laughed and I had to join in. \"Chris how are we going to get these down the stairs?\" I sighed as we looked down the staircase with the trunks in our hands. \"We're strong girls. We can do it. Grrr,\" Poppy flexed an arm and I giggled uncontrollably. Poppy was hilarious and now it feels like we've been friends most of our lives. \"Yeah. A lot of muscle there Pops. I can tell the um... working outs helping. Bet you'll have a six-pack soon,\" I grinned and started to drag the trunks down the staircase. \"Nehh... Freddy's got a six-pack. I don't need my own,\" She smirked and I rolled my eyes. Trust Poppy to say that. \"I don't know quite what to say to that,\" I glanced at her from a couple of steps down. Poppy then proceded to drag the two trunks she had as well. Freddy's POV I waited outside with Kiki and Josie who were having an argument about whether Robert Pattison or Taylor Lautner were better looking. I didn't want to put in an input to the 'discussion'. Drippy walked through the entrance doors and over to us eating a wagon wheel. \"Kate and Poppy still not down then,\" She glanced at us all and we shook our heads. Drippy then made her way over to the girls and joined in the debate. I was getting impatient. I want never exactly the most patient person. I tapped my foot getting slightly restless and quite bored of 'omg how can you say that? Have you seen Taylor topless?' or 'but he's a vampire. And vampire's are soooo cool.' I sat down on one of the benches that were infront of the school. Poppy better move that pretty little ass of hers quicker. Just then the big, grand doors moved aside to uncover two girls who looked very small incomparison to the doors. Poppy and Kate. They were both struggling with two trunks each. I made my way over to them and took the two Poppy was holding off her. Wow. They were heavier than expected. \"You're stronger than you look Trouble. These are heavy,\" I smiled at Poppy who was flexing her fingers. \"Yeah. Well you didn't have to carry them down three flights of stairs,\" She laughed. \"Muscle woman?\" I cocked an eyebrow up. \"Neh. I'm super woman,\" She grinned. \"Aha. And I'll be super man,\" I chucked slightly. I took the trunks over to wear my own stuff was by a tree. Kate followed me and put hers beside the trunks I just put down. \"My mum wants a word with you by the way Poppy.\" \"Do you know why?\" She frowned. \"No idea. Sorry I'm not much help,\" I smiled apolegetically. \"That's alright. Well I'll see you soon,\" She kissed my cheek before dashing back into the school.[Chapter 3] Hi, Okay so if there's any mistakes here I'm sorry. I mean it's 4:00 in the morning. I've been awake all night. I couldn't get to sleep so I decided to come on here. Anyways... On with the story. Els xxx Poppy's POV So I'd been pacing back and fourth infront of Mrs Kingsley's office for about 10 minutes now if the clock on the opposite wall was to be correct. I hadn't mustered up the courage to knock yet. (Haha. I just realized Freddy did that in chapter one. How alike they are. Anyway I'll let you get back to the story) What incase one of Harriet's minions had ratted me out to Mrs Kingsley about something I didn't do. I made my way past the door to her office for about the millionth time. I sighed and stopped right infront of the place where the picture of my mum hung on the wall. I took a deep breath before making my way back to the door and knocking quietly. \"Who is it?\" Came the voice of the headteacher. I felt my stomach turn slightly. \"It's Poppy,\" I called out to her. There was a faint noise which sounded like muffled voices. She seemed to be finishing a phone call. After a couplde of minutes I heard. \"Come in Poppy,\" I turned the knob of the door gently and pushed the door open. I stepped onto the treshold of the office. Mrs Kingsley smiled at me which encouraged me to move a step forward. She then gestured to the seat infront oh her. I made my way over and sat down. \"You're probaly wondering why I brought you here,\" She said and waited for me to nod before continuing, \"Well I wanted to firstly tell you how proud of you I am. You did amazingly on the lacrosse team and you've made an excellant start to the school. I and everyone else here loves the new you.\" \"Thanks Miss. I really like it here. I think it's become more of a home to me than my house in LA,\" I smiled slightly feeling the knot in my stomach loosen. \"Well that's wonderful,\" She beamed at me, \"I also wanted to discuss yours and Freddy's relationship. I know you probaly don't want to hear this on your last day here but seeing as I've allowed him to stay with you in LA I thought I should mention it.\" \"Yes. I was waiting for this to come up. And I think now's probaly the best time,\" I managed a small nod and looked at my hands cupped in my lap. \"I know that he feels strongly for you. I can tell. And I also know you feel the same for him. I'm not worried that you'll hurt him as I've seen how you are together,\" She laughed quietly, \"Yes I know how you sneak out together.\" \"I'm... Um really, really sorry about that,\" I whispered feeling my cheeks flush pink. \"No need to apologize. You're teenagers. I just don't want the relationship to mess up either of your school work. Freddy wants to go to Oxford for university. I think you'll have heard my rules for Freddy about what happens if either of your grades drop and I wanted to say that if this happens I'll be forced to unable you from seeing eachother.\" \"I understand Miss. I'm going to try very hard with my work,\" I smiled what I hoped was a reassuring smile. \"I believe you Poppy. Then there's the no fraternizing with the girls rule,\" She said slowly and I looked to her expression which was unreadable, \"I think we should keep it the same. But you're the exception. You can see each other at weekends. And in the week you can see him after you've done you're homework for a couple of hours. You can be up later that 8:30 though.\" \"That seems exceptable,\" I nodded silently thanking God. \"You're a good girl Poppy,\" She smiled at me and got up from her chair. She made her way around the desk and towards the door. I followed her lead. She held the door open for me. \"Thanks,\" I glanced at her, smiling. \"You're welcome,\" And then I did something which surprised us both. I hugged her. Threw my arms around her and hugged her hard. She laughed quietly and returned the hug for a couple of seconds. \"Okay now get going Poppy. Don't keep the girls waiting.\" I nodded and stepped through the door wondering how I'd ever been scared about what she wanted to say. Freddy's POV I sat on the grass below a tall tree giving me shade from the warm sun. Kate and Drippy were flicking through a magazine and commenting on what they saw there while Kiki and Josie had a headphone each to an iPod that Kiki was holding on her knee. Poppy had been gone for quite a while now and I was getting restless. I glanced at the doors one last time before promising myself that I wouldn't look at the doors again as everything was alright. \"Missing me hey Fredster. Saw you glancing at the doors,\" Somehow Poppy had found her way outside without me noticing which made me think she was some kind of super hero. She smiled and sat down next to me. \"How'd you get out here without me noticing?\" I asked with a frown. Poppy laughed slightly. \"I'm super woman remembe? Duhh,\" She grinned playfully before shrugging, \"I came round the back way. It's quicker.\" \"It so isn't quicker. That takes at least five minutes longer,\" I argued. \"Ner-uh. I counted one time. Back way is soooo much quicker,\" She crossed her arms and I laughed. \"Okay, okay you win,\" I said and she stuck out her tongue. \"Good,\" Then she lay her head on my chest and I put an arm around her. I stroked her hair and she smiled, closing her eyes. \"I hope you're getting the lovey-dovey stuff out of the way so you won't be like this all holiday,\" Kate spoke up from where her and Drippy were on the bench. \"Yeah. It's disgustin'. It makes me wanna throw up my breakfas',\" Josie agreed, nodding which made the headphone fall out of her ear. She recieved it from her lap and stuffed it back into her ear. \"Nope. This is only us getting started,\" Poppy laughed as she opened her eye. And completley surprising me she jumped across me causing me to fall backwards. Her arms were going around my neck and she started kissing me deeply. Her tongue lightly traced my bottom lip awaiting access which I kindly gave. While her tongue was exploring my mouth I moved my arms from around her shoulders to her hips. Our lips were totally insync. The kiss was filled with so much love and desire. Passion and lust. It was filled with so many sparks which engulfed me so much that I never wanted the kiss to stop. I had no clue about my surroundings. All I felt was the kiss. And Poppy. \"Um... Guys?\" Kiki was yelling to us. Obviously being nicer than just saying 'get off each other and stop sucking face' although she meant that. \"Hellooo?\" Josie called out to us. We ignored them both. \"Stop it... Eww have you seen where he's got his hand. Get off of each other,\" Drippy shouted. Drippy being Drippy was totally to the point. No messing around. Just saying what she meant. Then Drippy's words cut through everything and I finally realized where my hand was. One was up the front of Poppy's t-shirt and the other was at her bottom (sorry, couldn't think of a better way of putting it.) I retracted my hand from her t-shirt and her bottom. Poppy pulled back for air, breathing heavily. She had a smirk playing on her lips. Obviously. This was Poppy we were talking about. She rolled off me and lay on the grass again. I put the hand which had previously occupied her shirt into Poppy's. \"That was gross. Keep that to the bedroom please,\" Kate wrinkled up her nose. This made Poppy burst out laughing. \"I think they'll be more than that in the bedroom Kate,\" Kiki said to all of our surprise. Then everyone started laughing harder. Well I finished this last night and I would of posted then but I fell asleep on my laptop. I woke up just now and posted it. But there will be mistakes as I haven't checked through it and it was written late at night (or early in the morning). Reviews would be nice but I love it when you favourite. ","Summary":" Summary- So Poppy Moore finally felt at happy for once. But the story doesn't end there. What happe"},{"Movie":"Tristan + Isolde","Title":"The Untold Legend of Tristan and Iseult","Author":"Fair Sword Maiden","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5801826","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I do not own the legend of Tristan and Iseult. Yes, this is based on the legend in Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Athur and not the movie! My name is Tristan, and I am an orphaned child. I never knew who my parents were, but they must have had a tragic death. This I know, because my name means \"child of sorrow.\" I am seventeen years old, and I have been training to be a knight ever since I was seven. Cornwall, the kingdom in which I live, is in great danger. The ruler of the kingdom, King Mark, was once a just ruler; that is, until his wife, Queen Iseult, disappeared one day and never returned. No one knows exactly why. Some say that his wife went to a distant land and never returned, while others say that she died from drinking poison. Sometimes, I wish that I could approach the King of Cornwall and speak with him. He has inflicted so much danger upon our kingdom. For example, his guards roam the street, ready to punish anyone who insults the king, peasants have inadequate homes and starve in the winter, and he calls on many battles, which tears apart the entire city. I cannot approach the king with my status as a squire. The king will not let an orphan who has no idea of who his parents were speak with him. Even though I am going to be a knight, the king would push me from his castle. I am tall at 5' 10\", but am also very thin. I have thick curly black hair, and pale skin. Although I may look weak, I am actually one of the strongest knights in my school, so says my master. The story begins as I am finishing the last stages of becoming a knight, and I meet with my master, Sir Matthew. \"Tristan, most men don't finish their training as a knight until they are eighteen years of age. Ever since I met you when you were just a boy of seven, I knew you had the greatest potential to become a noble knight. As a result, you passed through your tests quickly, and here you are now, seventeen and preparing to be dubbed,\" Sir Matthew said. \"I know. But, I still haven't completed my final test,\" I said. \"No, you have not. For you, I've thought of something,\" he said. \"What might that be?\" I asked. \"Every squire is given a task that seems almost nearly impossible to complete as his final test. As your final test, I want you to learn the truth of Queen Iseult. I know that this is difficult, but you seem to be the kind of man that will succeed,\" Sir Matthew said. I sat back and sighed. \" How will I ever succeed with that mission?\" I desperately wanted to become a knight, and it would be very foolish to turn down the mission. But how could I begin this task without knowing where to begin? I took a deep breath. \"I accept the challenge,\" I said. \"Very well, Tristan. Meet me here tomorrow morning and I will give you your instructions. Tomorrow is the day you will begin,\" the knight said. He then opened the door for me to leave. \"Wait. . .I'm leaving tomorrow?\" I asked. \"Yes. A true knight never lingers. I'm giving you enough time to say your final goodbyes this evening. Good day,\" he said as he pushed me out the door. I decided to take the long route through the village on the way back to my stall. This was my last chance to walk through the town, and I wanted to say goodbye to a few people. I greeted everyone I knew as I walked through the village. \"Good day to you, Tristan. Do you need any fresh fruit?\" the woman selling fruit said. \"No, but I thank you,\" I said as I bowed. \"Oh, isn't he such a gentleman? He has been taught well,\" the fruit woman said to another woman. \"I think that he is naturally kind. Any young maiden would be lucky to meet him, for he is the ideal knight and husband I assure you,\" the woman said. I smiled as I walked away. Most of the elderly woman in the town said this about me. As I continued walking, I saw the person that I was looking for. \"Rosetta,\" I said softly as I walked behind her. The young maiden looked up, and her face brightened. \"Tristan! How was your meeting with Sir Matthew?\" she asked. Rosetta linked her arm in mine, and we began to walk. I met Rosetta a very long time ago, back when I began my training as a page, when I was seven. We used to talk to each other and play games in the street when Sir Matthew sent me to the village to buy food. Rosetta and I became instant friends, but it wasn't until recently that I actually fell in love with her. This was when I asked if I could be her knightly protection and she accepted. There was only one problem; I loved Rosetta, but I wasn't sure if she loved me. I feared that she merely thought me as a very good friend instead of her knight. For the longest time, I have wanted to propose to her, but I had to wait until I had more money after I became I knight. I would be a foolish knight if I married and didn't have the money I needed to support a family. I sighed and said, \"Very good. I need to go on a mission to complete my knightly training,\" I said. \"What kind of a mission is it?\" Rosetta asked. Her beautiful blue eyes seemed to pierce through my heart every time she spoke. \"I have to learn the truth of what became of Queen Iseult,\" I said. I heard her catch her breath. \"When will you be leaving?\" she asked. We had arrived at her front door. \"I better leave you here now,\" I said. \"No, my family can wait. Let us a take a walk through the woods,\" she said. \"Yes, if you insist,\" I said. As we walked, I told her everything Sir Matthew had told me. \"Oh Tristan, I can't believe that you're going to be dubbed already! It doesn't seem that long ago when you first came here to be a page,\" Rosetta said. I sighed. I remembered all the years we had spent together, and I would have to leave for a long time. Rosetta leaned her head against my shoulder as we gazed at the sunset. \"Rosetta, there is only one problem. I don't know where I'm supposed to being with this mission,\" I said. \"Well, you must speak with Sir Matthew. Surely he will tell you exactly what you must do,\" Rosetta said. \"Easier said than done. Besides, this isn't the mission I want to embark on,\" I said. \"What is it that you seek?\" she asked. Her voice sounded so sweet and innocent, but she already knew my answer. \"You know, Rosetta. I seek to learn the truth of my parents. I don't have the slightest idea of who they were. By my name, I have guessed that they are dead, and they must have been noble, since I am becoming a knight,\" I said. \"If that is what you wish, then you must be the one to fulfill it, Tristan. You must retrace your steps from when you first came here. Where did you live before you became a page?\" she asked. \"I lived in a monastery ten miles from this village,\" I said. \"Really? Was it the monastery of Benedictine monks?\" she asked. \"Yes. They raised me until I was sent away,\" I said. \"I've been there before. My family and I took a pilgrimage a few years ago. Did you ever ask them how you arrived?\" Rosetta asked. I thought for a moment. \"Since I was young, they never told me the exact truth. They would always say that God sent me to the doorstep one cold night. However, someone must have brought me,\" I said. \"Tristan, you are a man now. You must return to the monastery and ask the monks of your past, and who brought you to them. It is the only way you'll find who your parents were. Before you leave tomorrow, ask Sir Matthew if you can speak with the monks. It may be your last chance,\" Rosetta said. She was now looking into my eyes. \"I know, Rosetta,\" I said. She placed her hand in mine. \"I know you're not thrilled about this quest, but this is probably the best time to embark on it,\" she said. \"Why?\" I asked. \"King Mark is more desperate then ever wanting to know what happened to his wife, Queen Iseult. He has a great reward of money ready for anyone who finds the evidence for him. Perhaps if he knows the truth, Cornwall will be a safer place,\" Rosetta said. \"Knowing the truth or not won't make Cornwall any safer. King Mark is a bloodthirsty tyrant,\" I said. \"Tristan, according to the villagers, King Mark was once a kind and generous ruler before his wife mysteriously left. Unfortunately, we've only known the bloodthirsty King Mark,\" she said. I snorted. I still wasn't convinced, even though Rosetta tried to cheer me up. Rosetta sat on the ground, and I took a seat next to her. She then rested her head on my shoulder. \"I hope you're to gone too long. I'll miss you, Tristan,\" she said. \"I'll come back for you. I've always kept my promises, haven't I?\" I asked. She nodded. I then realized that this was the perfect opportunity to tell her about my feelings for her. \"There is something that I've been meaning to tell you, Rosetta,\" I said. She looked frightened at first. I could tell by the look in her face that she knew what I was going to ask. Rosetta simply wasn't ready for me to speak of marriage. \"Yes, what is it, Tristan?\" she asked. \"We have known each other for ten years. Every year, I feel as if we have become closer. But it wasn't until I asked to be your knight when my feelings changed,\" I said. She was beginning to sweat. \"Yes?\" she asked weakly. \"I'm afraid that I may never see you again after my journey. Since I must embark soon, I want you to know that I love you-\" \"Tristan! Stop!\" Rosetta yelled. She stood up. \"Have I hurt you in any way?\" I asked. \"No, it's just that, I'm not ready for this. My parents tell me continuously that I am sixteen and am not married. My father has even arranged for me to meet suitors he has chosen. They don't understand that I don't want to marry right now,\" Rosetta said. \"What is it that you seek?\" I asked. \"I've always wanted to go on an adventure of some sort. I've always wanted to change the mind of King Mark. I would love to be the one to learn the truth of his wife. Unlike yourself, I have an idea of what may have happened to her,\" she said. \"What?\" I asked. \"A few years ago, my father hired a scribe named Balrid to work for him. When I was cleaning the house one day, I found a sheet of parchment he accidentally left behind. It said that the queen had returned to her home of Brittany after her marriage, and wasn't seen for a long time after. This could be a clue to what happened to her,\" Rosetta said. \"Brittany? That means you'd have to travel to France, Rosetta. Tell me, did this scribe seem trustworthy? How would he know more about the queen's disappearance than King Mark himself?\" I asked. \"Tristan, Balrid is very trustworthy. I had asked him questions, and I came to learn that he was always right. I have thought of what I read about Queen Iseult for a long time. There is a theory I have come up with,\" Rosetta said. \"What might that be?\" I asked. \"I believe that King Mark does know what happened to Queen Iseult. I know that he loved her, but his grief is probably over her death,\" she said. \"If that were the case, then it doesn't make any sense. Let's say that King Mark truly knows. Why would he want people to go on a mission to find the truth and reward them?\" I asked. \"Oh Tristan! Why must you always ask questions like these?\" Rosetta asked. I was only being realistic, and she would always get upset when I wanted the truth. \"There is one thing that the king does not know, and this I know for sure,\" Rosetta said. \"Now, what is that?\" I asked. \"During her marriage, something terrible happened to Queen Iseult. No one knows, but she always seemed attracted to another man, although she loved King Mark. It is said that she had an affair with one of his knights, and she had a child. This union wasn't her fault, or the knight's, either. They were both under some sort of spell it seemed. King Mark wants to find the child, Tristan. This is the mission,\" Rosetta said. \"It's starting to sound better than before. I believe that you know much about the queen, Rosetta, and you can succeed. But, it is improper for a young maiden like you to travel alone. You must have an escort,\" I said. \"Even though you're my knight, I cannot go until you finish your final training,\" she said. \"I know. Going on a mission like that would be dangerous for you, Rosetta. I just want you to be safe. After I become I knight, we will have many adventures together,\" I said. She nodded her head. \"Yes, that is fair enough,\" she said. \"Then, I must prepare for my mission tomorrow. Come, I will walk you back home,\" I said. Again, she linked her arm in mine, and we walked away. Once I brought her to her home, I looked at her for a moment. Even though it was dark, I could still see her fair white skin and brown hair. Like always, her blue eyes could pierce through any darkness. She was much shorter than I, her head barely reaching my shoulder. No matter, I still thought she was beautiful, especially tonight, one of the last times I would see her for a period of time. She stepped away from me for a moment and held the folds of her skirt. \"So, is this when we must say goodbye?\" Rosetta asked. \"Yes. I will see you as soon as I can, Rosetta. But now, goodbye, and good luck with everything. I hope all goes well when you meet your suitors,\" I said. She sighed. \"Tristan, I don't even want to think of that,\" she said. \"Just remember, I'll always be your knight,\" I said. \"Tristan, if I have a really bad suitor, will you be able to send a dragon after him?\" she asked. I laughed. \"No, I'm afraid I can't do that but I wish that I could,\" I said. We laughed for a while, but sighed again. Rosetta's eyes filled with tears, as she hugged for what seemed to be the last time. \"Goodbye, Tristan. I hope you will succeed in learning the truth of the Queen,\" Rosetta said. \"I hope I can, too,\" I said. I kissed her cheek, and she slowly pulled away from me. \"I must go, Tristan,\" she said. \"And I, too,\" I said. I saw her blush and touch her cheek as she walked away. Maybe I had frightened her, trying to tell her of my affections. But I still cared for her, and I would finish telling her of my feelings eventually. She would be more mature after my journey. Even after my journey, I will be a knight, and it would be easier to propose to Rosetta because of my social status.[Chapter 2] A/N: Alright, here's chapter 2. Thank you for being patient. Remember to leave a review at the end. Reviews motivate me to keep writing my stories. I especially thank the people who took the time to review the last chapter! Disclaimer: I do not own the legend of Tristan and Iseult from Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur . I spent the rest of the night packing my things, and I tried to sleep, but I kept thinking of my mission, the truth of Queen Iseult, and of course, Rosetta. I knew she was right. The only way I could find a way to learn of my parents was to ask the Benedictine monks. They would tell me the truth now because I was a man, like Rosetta said. But, I had to tell ask Sir Matthew if I could spend a bit of time visiting them, first. The morning finally arrived, and I met Sir Matthew in his small home. He was surprised to see that I was ready to leave after we spoke, for I already had my sack slung over my shoulder, and my sword girded to my waist. \"Are you leaving already?\" Sir Matthew asked. \"I want to leave as soon as I can. A true knight does not linger,\" I said, echoing his previous statement. \"Ah, you are right, Tristan. You seem to be the only knight who takes my advice seriously,\" Sir Matthew said as he laughed. \"Sir Matthew, I was wondering if I could ask you a question,\" I asked. \"Yes, what is it?\" he asked. \"I have the fear that if I go on this mission, I may not be able to return to Cornwall,\" I began. \"Of course you'll return to Cornwall, Tristan! After all, this is your knightly mission. The only reason you wouldn't return is if you died,\" Sir Matthew said. \"Great, that makes me feel spectacular,\" I replied. \"Tristan, you're hiding something because you're acting really odd,\" Sir Matthew said with a puzzled look. \"It's just that I want to know at least a clue of who my parents were. Why am I becoming a knight? Was my father truly a noble? Were they natives of Cornwall?\" I said. \"What point are you trying to make, Tristan?\" he asked. \"I was wondering if you would let me make a short visit to the Benedictine monastery before I depart. I wanted to ask them a few questions,\" I said. \"Tristan, are you crazy? You could seriously delay your mission if you chooses to visit the monks,\" Sir Matthew said. \"Sir Matthew, this is my last chance. I really want to have some sort of clue before I begin my quest,\" I said. \"Tristan, you really are the most passionate knight I've ever met. This will be the last time I let you delay any mission. I will give you three hours to speak to the monks and no more. If you exceed the time limit, I will not have you continue with this mission. Is that understood?\" Sir Matthew said. \"Yes. Thank you so much, Sir Matthew,\" I said. \"Away with you! You mustn't waste any time,\" he said as he pushed me from the door. ********** It took me a while to walk the three miles that lead to the monastery. I remembered the times I lived there as a boy. My friends and I would often roam in the woods, pretending to have sword fights with wooden swords that we made ourselves. It was a shame that I hadn't seen the monks since I was seven. I had been too busy with my training, and I loved my school, except for the time I tried to run away as a page. After my feet were finally tired, I stumbled upon the monastery. Like always, there was a group of young boys running around the front yard. I was looking for Friar Francis, the monk who acted like a father-like figure when I lived at the monastery. I didn't see him outside, but he was probably in the monastery, praying. I hoped that I didn't have to make an appointment to see him. There was a younger monk standing outside, not too much older than me. As I approached him, the boys stopped moving. \"Is that really a squire?\" one boy said. I smiled at him. \"Yes, and I am to become a knight soon,\" I said. I turned to the monk. \"Excuse me, friar, but does Friar Francis still reside here?\" I asked. \"Why, yes. But, he is busy right now. He is very old, and spends his days in prayer. You must make an appointment in order to see him,\" the monk said. \"Is there a way that I can see him now? It is rather urgent, and I must see him soon,\" I said. \"Well, yes. Does he know who you are? What is your name?\" he asked. \"Tell him that an old student of his wishes to speak with him about something rather personal, and his name is Tristan,\" I said. \"Follow me.\" The monk led me into the monastery. Once I walked through the doorway, I felt as if I had stepped back in time to my childhood. The hallways didn't seem as huge as they used to, since I had grown, but the large paintings of Christ's Passion still hung on the walls. The essence was still here, even though I had been absent for nine years. Finally, we reached the door that lead to the chapel. \"Wait here,\" the monk said. As I waited, I prayed that he would want to see me. If not, it could mean the failure of my knighthood. The monk came back. \"He says that you can speak with him,\" he said. He pushed me into the chapel, and closed the door. There, I saw Friar Francis. He looked much more advanced in years than the last time I saw him, but I still recognized his bright smile. He turned to me and his eyes widened. \"No, that can't be you can it, Tristan?\" he asked. His voice was frail. \"Yes, it is I,\" I said. \"Come here, and sit next to me!\" he said. I sat next to him in the pew, and he gave me a weak hug. \"I can't believe that you have come back. Now, what is it that you want?\" he asked. \"Well, it's something rather urgent that I must know,\" I said. \"Tristan, had you been and immoral young man since you've been away?\" he asked. \"Oh, no. Many tell me that I am the noblest squire anyone has ever met,\" I said. \"Yes, that's what I wanted that hear,\" he said. \"But, this is something I've wanted to know for a long time. I'm a man now, Friar Francis, and I must know how I came to this monastery,\" I said. He sat back and thought for a moment. He closed his eyes, trying to remember. \"Seventeen years ago, it was a cold rainy night,\" he began. I hoped that I didn't ask too much of him, for he may not have remembered. \"Ah, yes! It was a cold rainy night, and I was copying prayer books for some new monks who came here, since we are too poor to hire a scribe. Anyways, as I was writing, my quill broke. I went to another office to find one, and I began to trim it. That was when I heard a rattling at the door. I ignored it at first, thinking it was only the wind and rain. But it seemed more consistent, and I decided to look. \"When I looked out the window, I saw a woman who was soaked to the bone. Thinking that she needed counseling, I opened the door. I asked her if there was anything she needed, but she didn't answer. I then noticed that she had a baby in her hands. I welcomed her in, and gave her some soup leftover from the previous meal. After she ate, she was more comfortable to speak. \"She told me that she had traveled a long way with you. The woman told me that your name was Tristan, that you were of noble birth, and to send you off to become a knight when you were seven years of age. I told her that I would watch the child, but I asked her some other questions. She never told me her name, or where she brought you from. It seemed rather private. But, I learned where you came from after I examined the blanket you came in,\" he explained. He stood up, and told me to follow him to his office. There, he opened a trunk. \"I always keep records of all the children who have stayed here. If I find some clue of their parents and family, I document it. I look for things like symbols of nations and family names. Ah, here it is,\" he said as he pulled out a large book. He flipped to the middle, until he found my name. \"Here you are, you can read what is documented,\" Friar Francis said. He handed me the book, and I read the description. It said: \" A baby boy by the name of Tristan was brought to the monastery by a woman on the 21 st of November in the year 1200. She did not tell us her name or where this baby had come from, only that he was of noble birth and was to begin training as a knight once he turned seven. He was wrapped in a blanket made of blue velvet, and in the corner this symbol was embroidered.\" I looked at the symbol that was drawn next to my description. \"Why, it's the symbol of Brittany,\" I said. \"Exactly. You came from France,\" Friar Francis said. \"But if I came from France, why was I brought to England?\" I asked. He shrugged his shoulders. \"France has always been bloody, Tristan. Your parents could have died there, and one of their handmaidens brought you here to be safe,\" he said. \"Surely Cornwall isn't any safer than Brittany under the rule of King Mark,\" I said. \"I know someone who may know a bit more about this. A scribe came here to volunteer writing some books for us. He is a trustworthy source, so we should meet with him now,\" Friar Francis said. He led me up to the second floor of the monastery, where the boys stayed. At the end of the hall, he knocked on a door. \"Come in,\" a muffled voice said. Inside, a man was gray hair wearing a red cap sat, copying a book. \"Tristan, this is Balrid. Balrid, Tristan had a few questions about the kingdom of Brittany,\" Friar Francis said. He explained my story to him. Balrid! My heart raced. He must have been the same scribe who worked for Rosetta's father. I wanted to ask him if he knew her, but I had to focus on my mission. \"Balrid, what was the status of Brittany seventeen years ago?\" I asked. \"Well, it was somewhat bloody, but still safe. I'm not quite sure why you would be brought here. Perhaps one of your parents was Cornish. Here's what I think. Your father must have been Cornish, so you were brought here. Traditionally, an orphaned child is sent to the home of his father,\" he said. \"That could be true,\" I said. I then remembered what Rosetta had said about Queen Iseult. Maybe Balrid could have a few answers as to where I would begin. \"Balrid, I am on a mission to learn the truth of Queen Iseult as my final knightly test. Do you know where I could possibly begin?\" I asked. \"I have seen fools like yourself try to solve this case, Tristan. Everyone just stays here in Cornwall looking for her. Some people return to her home in Ireland. This is not the place to look for her, either,\" Balrid said. \"Then where must I go?\" I asked. \"Brittany. The same place where you are believed to have come from. It is said that Queen Iseult had connections in Brittany. I used to have a document stating that she was last seen in Brittany right after she had disappeared from King Mark,\" Balrid explained. \"How can I get to Brittany? I can't afford to travel by sea, and my master can't afford to pay for my voyage either,\" I explained. \"Well, your master will tell you to search in the most obscure places in Cornwall. You will never find any evidence there. If you offer something innovative to the king, he will let you get on a ship. But it is a good idea to have money just in case he makes you pay,\" Balrid explained. \"Where do I get all this money from? I just have a few coins,\" I said. \"I have money. Perhaps you can sell me something that you own,\" he said. I looked through my bag. I mostly had clothes and food. I found the necklace Rosetta had given me as the token I was her knight, but I could never sell it. Finally, I found something he would love. It was an extremely dry book about how to joust written in ancient Latin. I handed it to the scribe, and he was thrilled. In exchange, he gave me a sack of coins. \"This should be enough for taking the ship there and back, and some spending money for food. I wish you the best of luck,\" Balrid said. \"Wait! I can't just go the Brittany! I need to know where in Brittany to go!\" I said. \"Ah, that is what you must learn for yourself. You must go to the palace in Brittany and ask them if they know anything about Queen Iseult,\" Balrid said. \"This seems too simple. Are you sure that's all I need to do?\" I asked. \"That's where I would start. You will learn more for yourself once you are in Brittany. After visiting the palace, you should talk to some local scribes,\" he said. \"Tristan, I really must get back to the chapel. Please say goodbye when you leave,\" Friar Francis said. \"I will.\" He left us alone. \"Where do I begin?\" I asked. \"Well, you'll have to make a visit to the Castle of Cornwall. Since you're a knight, they'll let you on. However, you'll just have to get permission from the king,\" Balrid said. \"The king? How?\" I asked. \"He just has to sign a paper. However, when you're at the castle, just state your business. Do not try to start and argument with the king by asking him of his wife. Basically don't do anything stupid. He'll have you killed for sure,\" Balrid said. \"Just one more thing. I know that you worked for a family in the village at one point. Do you remember a girl named Rosetta?\" I asked. \"Why, yes, I do. She is a sweet girl. She often asked me questions about the history of Cornwall, and we spent many afternoons talking and sharing different stories. Do you know her?\" he asked. \"Yes. I have known her since I've been training as a page,\" I said, but I could tell that I was blushing. \"Oh, you like her, don't you?\" he said in a somewhat playful manner. \"Aye, you are right, Balrid. I am already her knight, and my wish is to marry her someday. I told her that if I was successful in my journey, we would go on many adventures together,\" I said. I then thought for a moment. Rosetta said that her first destination would be Brittany, and that was where I was heading also. I had an idea. \"Balrid, I wish I could do this, but I must go since I only have so much time for my mission. If you don't mind, could you go to Rosetta's home with a message from me?\" I asked. \"Certainly, Tristan. What is it that you wish to tell her?\" he asked. \"Tell her that I am going to Brittany, and I want her to meet me there. But tell her to be careful, and to bring a guardian with her,\" I said. \"And how will she pay for this?\" he asked. I handed Balrid another book, this one was about how to forge your own sword. Since I knew how to do this from memory, I didn't need it. He handed me a sack of coins, but I held up my hands. \"Promise me you'll bring those coins to Rosetta. I will pay for her travels,\" I said. \"Oh, you really are a generous young man, Tristan. You'll be a very noble husband to her someday,\" Balrid said. I smiled. \"Thank you for everything, Balrid,\" I said. \"Wait! Take this! It is a map of Brittany! You'll need it!\" Balrid said. \"Thank you,\" I said. \"I'm sorry that I didn't give it to you earlier, Tristan. Good luck and I'll speak with Rosetta this evening,\" he said. I ran down the stairs and entered the chapel, where Friar Francis ran to me. \"I'm going to Brittany,\" I said. \"Oh, Tristan! I'm so proud of you! I wish you that best of luck, and I'll pray that you'll succeed! Will you promise me that you'll pay me with a visit after your journey?\" he asked. \"Of course. And, I invite you to my knighting ceremony,\" I said. \"Oh, I'll be there, Tristan. Goodbye, you have become a great knight and man,\" he said. **************** I quickly returned to Sir Matthew's home, and he greeted me. \"So, what did you learn?\" he asked. \"Based on Friar Francis' records, I came from Brittany,\" I said. \"Brittany? You, a French child?\" he asked. \"Sir Matthew, I don't have enough time to go through all the details. I want to being my mission. Where do I begin?\" I asked. \"Well, I am going to send you to the outskirts of Cornwall. There, I want you to find any evidence you can that may relate to the queen,\" he began. \"I won't find anything,\" I said without thinking. \"What?\" he said. \"I spoke to a scribe named Balrid, and he says that any man who has tried to learn the truth of Queen Iseult keeps making the same mistake,\" I said. \"What do you mean, you fool?\" Sir Matthew asked. \"Sir Matthew, he said that the truth of Queen Iseult is to be found in Brittany,\" I said. Sir Matthew cringed. \" I cannot send you to Brittany,\" he said. \"I have the money to pay for it,\" I said. \"Money is not the issue here, Tristan. It is your safety. Have you been aware of how dangerous France is at the present moment?\" Sir Matthew asked. \"I know that it is bloody, but as a knight, I do not take my own safety into account. I value the lives of the people of Cornwall more than my own,\" I said. \"Tristan, I know that you are a very brave knight, but I cannot afford to lose you. You are going to be the best knight I have ever trained, and all I need you to do is find a small amount of evidence in Cornwall about the Queen,\" Sir Matthew said. \"So, you expect me to not even complete the truth of what happened to Queen Iseult? I'm not going to find anything here!\" I said. Sir Matthew sighed. \"Alright, Tristan. I feel that I cannot persuade you to stay here. The information you have is true. I know for a fact that there is some solid evidence regarding the queen in Brittany. I will allow you to go. However, you may die in the process,\" he said. \"Then I will die with honor,\" I said. \"That's the spirit Tristan. You must be off to Cornwall castle, I suppose,\" he said. \"Yes. Thank you,\" I said. He patted me on the shoulder. \"I wish you the best of luck, and I'll pray for your safety,\" he said. \"Thank you, Sir Matthew,\" I said. \"Now, be off with you,\" he said as he pushed me out the door. I walked away, without looking back. ****************** In about two hours, I was standing at the entrance to Cornwall Castle. A guard came up to me. \"State your business,\" he said. \"My name is Tristan, and I wish to get permission from the king in order to ride a ship to Brittany,\" I said. \"Why must you go to Brittany?\" he asked. \"It is knightly business,\" I said. The guard let me in, and led me to the throne room. There, King Mark sat, his face pale, hair gray, eyes sagging and wrinkled. He wasn't old in years, but his reaction to his wife's disappearance made him seem as if he was ancient. \"What do you want?\" King Mark asked. I knelt down. \"Your majesty, King Mark, I ask you to let me ride a ship in order to travel to Brittany,\" I said. \"Why?\" he asked, eyes wide. \"I have been given the mission of learning what happened to Queen Iseult as my final test to become a knight\" I said. \"Tell me boy, who are your parents? What is your nobility?\" he asked. I felt the tips of my ears turn red. \"I do not know who my parents were. I only know that I am of noble birth because the woman who brought me to the monastery said so,\" I said. \"Bah! A boy who was raised by monks for the first part of his life? You're not of noble birth! You're a nomad! Be off! I will not waste my time with you! Why would I want you to learn the truth of my wife?\" King Mark yelled. \"But your majesty, you must listen! I am going on this mission as my final knightly test. If I cannot ride on one of your ships, then all hope is lost,\" I said. \"Then maybe you weren't meant to be a knight if your parents truly were nomads! If you failed at this mission and did not become a knight I wouldn't lose a minute of sleep about it!\" the old kind yelled. This time, I stood up and walked closer. \"Sire, you must allow me to go to Brittany! What harm can it bring upon you?\" I asked. \"I only let men ride on my ships who can prove their nobility to me! I do not care if this has to do with your final test! Be gone with you, and swim across the ocean if you wish to arrive at Brittany so badly. Maybe a bit of swimming will help you get stronger,\" he said as pointed his scepter at me. \"I will ask you only one more time. Please, let me go,\" I said firmly, as stood still with a serious expression. \"No! Be gone with you!\" King Mark yelled. Guards came over and grabbed my arms. One guard grabbed my hair and pulled my head backwards. The king walked forward and looked at my face, examining me closely. He turned my face from side to side, and then gasped. I was wondering if he was looking for something. I didn't have any birth marks or scars on my face, as far as I knew. \"Tell me your name!\" he demanded. \"I am Tristan, your majesty,\" I said. At this, the king began to tremble and choke as he stumbled back into his throne. \"What have you done to the king? You shall be killed!\" the guard next to me said as he unsheathed his sword. I broke away from the grasp of the guards and unsheathed my sword. \"Do not kill him!\" the king said. This time, he seemed like himself again. \"Tristan, I would like to apologize for my rudeness. I'll allow you to go to Brittany. While you are there, I hope that you do succed in learning the truth of my wife. If you do, I'll grant you with a great reward,\" King Mark said with and evil grin on his face. \"Thank you, my king,\" I said. For some reason, I had an uneasy feeling as the king signed the paper and allowed me to leave. Maybe he was sending me on a ship that leads to my death. I then had an idea. \"Your majesty, before I leave, there is something that I would like to tell you,\" I said. \"Yes, of course. What is it?\" he asked. \"There is a young maiden I know who will be asking to ride abroad your ship to Brittany. She should come here either today or tomorrow. If there is one request you can grant for me, please let her ride the ship without hesitation. She wants to join me on the quest to learn of your wife,\" I said. \"Ah, I see. I shall grant your request, Tristan. Please tell me, is this young maiden beautiful?\" he asked. I did not know how to respond, and I didn't know if I wanted the king to know much about Rosetta. I sighed and simply said, \"Yes, she is.\" An evil grin came across his face. I scowled at him and said, \"You will do me one more favor; do not harm her in any way, or else you will hear from me,\" I said. \"Oh, I will not harm her. I will be sure that she arrives to Brittany safely. Now, be gone with you! I hope that you are successful and have a safe journey across the sea,\" King Mark said. I knelt down. \"Thank you, your majesty,\" I said. After I exited the palace a group of guards led me to the ship. There, I saw an old friend of mine who had been dubbed a few years ago. \"Hello, Sir Michael. How are you?\" I asked. His eyes widened. \"Tristan? I can't believe that it's really you! How have you been? I mean, shouldn't you be at school?\" he asked. \"I have been rewarded by performing my final mission,\" I said. \"Really? So, why are you going to Brittany?\" Sir Michael asked. I recounted the entire story, from Sir Matthew telling me of my assigned mission, meeting with the friars and Balrid, and finally, talking to King Mark. \"I can't believe this, Tristan. I wish I were as lucky as you,\" he said. \"Yes. But, I am making a risk by going on this mission. If I do not succeed, I may prove that I am not fit to become a knight,\" I said. \"Tristan, you will succeed. You cannot doubt yourself. Sir Matthew wouldn't have sent you on your final mission if he did not believe you were ready. You just need to believe in yourself, and you can accomplish anything,\" Sir Michael said. I sighed. Everyone told me that, and it never made me feel better. Eventually, the ship took off. While we were sailing, Sir Michael and I had a chance to talk. \"So, what has become of you ever since you've been dubbed?\" I asked. \"Well, I think you already know that I work for the king now. I serve with all the traveling, especially when I need to speak with the kings of other lands. I sometimes act as a messenger,\" he said. \"Interesting. And what has become of your family?\" I asked. \"My mother has unfortunately died, but my father still lives, even though he is still in poor health. He said that he will not die until he marries off my two younger sisters,\" he said. I laughed. \"I know, I've heard that many fathers are like that nowadays. But Sir Michael, are you married yet?\" I asked. \"Yes, I married about two years ago and I have one young boy and another child on the way. I met my wife when I was finishing my knightly training. I had asked her if I could be my knight, and she accepted. Before I knew it, I had proposed to her, and we married,\" he said. \"When did you know it was the right time?\" I asked. \"Well, I just knew. After I had found myself a job where I was well paid and could support a wife and family, I felt ready. I eventually proposed, and everything fell into place. Why do you ask?\" he said. \"Oh, I just wanted to know, Michael. I myself want to propose to a young maiden after I am finished with my knightly training. Do you remember the girl named Rosetta?\" I asked. \"Ah, yes, how could I forget? Is this the maiden whom you will open your heart to?\" Michael asked. \"Aye, that is my wish,\" I said, blushing. \"She has grown into a beautiful young woman now, has she not?\" he asked. \"She has, and I hope that I can marry her after I am dubbed,\" I said. For a long while, Sir Michael and I spoke of knightly training, and our other duties. He began to tell me of his trips he had made to Brittany, and he taught me how to speak, behave, the best inns to stay in and so forth. After a few days, we had all become weary from traveling by sea. No one really spoke to each other, and we all just slept and ate. However, all was well when we finally landed on the shores of Brittany. \"Well Tristan, this is France. How do you like it?\" Sir Michael asked. \"I think that it's beautiful,\" I said. And it was; Brittany was an amazing city to behold. Upon my first appearance, I couldn't believe that I had come from here. Maybe my parents were people of importance. I couldn't be stupid, for they must have been, or else I wouldn't have become a knight. There was only one question I could ask myself; now that I was in Brittany, where do I begin searching? A/N: Ok, I hope you didn't find this chapter too long! I hope that you liked it. Now, don't forget to review if you want to know who or what Tristan discovers in Brittany![Chapter 3] Disclaimer: I still do not own Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d' Arthur A/N: Alright my friends! It's time for another chapter! This is a good one, so I would suggest making yourself comfortable. I looked around me. Where on earth do I begin? \"Tristan, you look confused. I'll help you find your way at first, but I'm afraid that I can't help you much since this is your own mission,\" Michael said. \"I know. I must speak to someone around here who may be able to give me some information about the Queen,\" I said. \"That's obvious. You must speak to the nobles of Brittany,\" Sir Michael said. \"Yeah right. I just can't talk to the nobles of Brittany with my status! I don't have a clue of who my parents were!\" I said. \"Well, you may want to seize the opportunity to visit a local orphanage while you're here. You could be in one of their record books. Besides, you came from Brittany,\" he said. \"Michael, I didn't come from an orphanage!\" I retorted. \"How do you know? The woman who brought you wasn't your mother, was she?\" he asked. I knew that Michael was right. Friar Francis didn't know if I had come from an orphanage. In fact, the woman who brought me to Cornwall didn't even say where I came from; he had learned from my blanket. I could have come from and orphanage for all that I knew; I just didn't want to admit it. \"You're right. That's where I shall look first,\" I said. \"The first orphanage is right down the road. You'll see it after you pass the bakery. Oh, and I should have asked you this earlier, but I assume that you are fluent in French?\" Sir Michael asked. \"Yes, I am,\" I said. \"Good. You must remember to speak the specified language now that we are in Brittany,\" Sir Michael said. \"I will. Well, I must be off. It was good speaking to you, Sir Michael,\" I said. \"Yes, I enjoyed our conversation. Good luck with finding the truth about the Queen,\" he said. \"Thank you,\" I shouted over my shoulder. I turned around and began to walk through the streets of Brittany. I was both excited and nervous at the same time. This was the first time I had been outside of England, and I had to speak a different language. France seemed different in England in some ways. First, the French seemed a bit more aggressive than the English. Men and women were arguing with each other in the streets, and the children seemed rather naughty. Many of them, especially the boys, were wrestling each other on the dirt ground. In addition, I saw many more beggars. \"Please sir! I have no money! I need something to eat! I haven't had anything to eat in such a long time!\" an old woman stammered in French as she grabbed my arm. I pulled a gold coin from my pocket and placed it in her outstretched hand. \"Here, you should be able to buy something,\" I said. \"Thank you, kind sir!\" she said as she ran away. I heard her stammer something about buying bread, so I followed her, thinking she was running to the bakery. And she was. At the bakery, I saw the orphanage. I sighed. \"Here it goes,\" I said under my breath. I quickly reviewed some simple French phrases as I walked up the pathway and turned to doorknob. There, I saw a middle-aged woman sitting at a desk. \"Hello, my lady. My name is Tristan, and I come from Cornwall. I was wondering if I appeared in your records,\" I said in my clearest French. The woman looked at me. \"Tristan of Cornwall? Tell me, were you once a child at this orphanage?\" she asked. \"That I do not know. I am not sure if I lived at an orphanage when I was a child. All I know is that I came from Brittany to Cornwall. A woman brought me to Cornwall to a monastery when I was a baby. The friars learned that I came from Brittany because the symbol was embroidered on my blanket,\" I said. \"Let me see. Tell me, what year and month were you born in?\" she asked. \"I only know that I arrived at the monastery in November of 1215. I do not know the month when I was born,\" I said. The women sighed as she stood up and entered a closet full of books. She stayed in there for a while until she found the record book of the year 1215. \"Here we are! Let's see if there are any 'Tristan's' in here!\" she said. She spent a decent amount of time flipping through the book, but eventually sighed. \"I do not see any records of a boy named Tristan in here,\" she said. \"You don't understand! I'm going to become a knight, and it is vital for me to know who my parents were,\" I said. \"Well then the answer is simple. Do not go to any other orphanages, they will not help you. Children who are of noble birth do not get sent to orphanages. They are sent to the homes of their fathers. Your father was a Cornwall native. That is why you were brought there. You must consult wise people, such as scribes and knights,\" she said. I was unsatisfied, and I think that she was slightly irritated with me. \"Thank you, my lady. I am sorry that I have wasted your time,\" I said as I bowed. I left the orphanage. I had to find a scribe around here. But where was one? I decided to ask the baker if he knew. Upon entering the bakery, a rather fat man cutting bread looked at me. \"What do you need? I have a fresh loaf of bread ready for you,\" he said. \"Oh, no thank you. I was wondering if you could tell me if you know of a scribe who works here locally,\" I said. \"The only scribes around here work in the castle, sir. It's hardly impossible to get into there without the knights scanning your entire background. If you are uncertain about your past, they won't let you in. And, if you try to lie about it, you'll get caught and you'll get killed,\" he said as he pointed a rolling pin at me. \"Oh. So, there aren't any scribes around here who own their own business?\" I asked. \"No, not here in France. I guess that you're a foreigner,\" he said. \"Yes, I come from England,\" I said. \"Where in England?\" he asked. \"I come from Cornwall, and I am finishing my knightly training,\" I said. \"Cornwall? Oh my. Are you going to be a knight for that vile King Mark?\" he asked. \"I am,\" I said. \"Oh, I see. Let me guess, you're here because you're trying to sort out the mystery of what happened to his wife, Queen Iseult, aren't you?\" he asked. \"Yes. It is the mission for my final knightly test,\" I said. \"Well, I'll tell you, there have been too many of King Mark's knights trying to solve the mystery here. That man has a heart of stone I'll tell you! I've heard that he mercilessly kills people who are slightly disobedient to him. He even stabbed his own nephew through the heart. He could've killed his own wife for all I know,\" he said. I tried to keep track of everything he said. He seemed to be knowledgeable. \"How do you know?\" I asked. \"Because, everyone always asks me questions about Brittany since my shop is right in the middle of the town. I always tell them that they won't learn much here in Brittany; they'll find more evidence in Cornwall,\" he said. \"Really? How would they be more successful in Cornwall? The whole kingdom has been searched for her, and nothing has ever been found,\" I said. \"Because, the queen was never affiliated with Brittany, and I have no idea why the King keeps sending people over here. I must stop speaking of this matter, because it is very dangerous. Some of King Mark's knights who are here could overhear this conversation,\" he said. \"Thank you, kind sir. You have given me much valuable information\" I said. \"You're welcome. Feel free to come anytime and talk to me. What is your name?\" he asked. \"Tristan of Cornwall,\" I said. \"Good day, Tristan. Here, I'll give you this loaf of bread. You'll need it,\" he said. \"Are you sure that you don't want any money?\" I asked. \"No, I'm always busy. Save your money for the important things that you'll need,\" he said. \"Thank you,\" I said as I bowed. As soon as I left the bakery, I heard people shouting. \"Give me that! You won't need it!\" a man shouted. \"No! It's all the money that I have! I need to buy food for my mother and I!\" a young woman's voice said. I looked over and saw a young maiden, probably about the age of fourteen, trying to fight off a boy who was stealing the coin from her hand. Other boys joined. No one seemed to notice the girl, so I ran toward the mob and unsheathed my sword. \"You! Leave that poor maiden alone!\" I shouted. The men looked at me. \"Oh, it's a foreigner! You don't belong here in Brittany! Come on, let's stone him!\" a boy said as he picked up a stone. I pointed my sword toward him. \"You have no business attacking this poor maiden and stealing her money. I am about to be a knight, and I can disarm you,\" I said. The boy dropped the stone and backed off. \"Let's go,\" he said. \"Wait!\" I said as I grabbed the boy's the shoulder and pulled the coin he had stolen from his hand. \"You can't do that!\" he shouted. \"Yes, I can. It was never yours in the first place,\" I said. He scurried off and his friends let go of the maiden, letting her drop to the ground. Once they had left, I held out my hand. She accepted, and I helped her stand up. \"Thank you for saving me from them, sir,\" she said while she blushed and looked away from me. \"Oh, you're welcome. Here, you may have your money back,\" I said as I placed it in her hand. \"Oh, thank you. You're the kindest man in Brittany that I've ever met,\" she said. \"I'm not from Brittany, young maiden. I am from Cornwall, and I am only staying for a little while, to finish my final training of knighthood,\" I said. \"Oh, how interesting. I've never met a knight in training before. Anyhow, my name is Isolde,\" she said as she curtsied. \"I am very pleased to have met you, Isolde. I am Tristan of Cornwall,\" I said as I bowed. She gasped when I told her my name, and she scanned me from head to toe. Then, she was normal again. \"Well, Tristan, I must be going. I have to buy bread and my mother will be worried if I'm not home after dark. Thank you for saving me,\" she said as she curtsied. \"Wait!\" I said as she walked away. She turned around. \"Yes?\" she asked. \"The baker gave me this loaf of bread. I won't need it, and I won't want to carry this large loaf around when I'm traveling. You can have it and save your money,\" I said. \"Oh, thank you so much, Tristan. It's getting rather late. If you want, you can come to our home and spend the night. My mother won't mind, she likes to have people who help us stay at our home,\" she said. I sighed. \"Well, I have to continue my mission, but staying one night won't ruin it. I'll have to leave early tomorrow morning,\" I said. \"Great! Follow me!\" Isolde said. ***************** As we walked through the woods to her home, I told Isolde why I had come to Brittany and she was fascinated. She told me that she wanted to help me with my mission, and that she might know some secrets about Queen Iseult. Eventually, I asked her about her family. \"So, does your mother stay at your home all the time?\" I asked. \"Yes, she usually doesn't like to go out in the public because she's shy,\" she said. \"What about your father?\" I asked. \"Well, I have a different situation with my father. My mother has been married twice. I was the only child who was born during her marriage with her first husband. He died right before I was born. And then she remarried. My stepfather has never been fond of me. He thinks that I am inferior to him, since I am not a child that he sired. I was often treated like a slave,\" Isolde said. \"So, what became of him?\" I asked. \"My father lives with my three younger siblings on the east side of Brittany. I never see him anymore. I miss my younger siblings, though. When we lived together, we would gather together every evening and my mother would tell us the tales of the wizard, Merlin,\" she said. \"Really? I loved the tales of Merlin when I was young, too,\" I said. She sighed, and we soon came upon her home. \"Mother! Mother! I'm home!\" she shouted. A woman with long golden hair stood in the doorway. Isolde ran up to her and greeted her. \"Oh, I'm so glad you're safe, Isolde,\" the woman said. \"Mother, I have brought a guest tonight. He saved me from the boys who bully me in the streets, and he gave us this bread,\" Isolde said quickly. \"Oh yes, tell him to come in,\" she said. \"Come in,\" Isolde said. As I stepped into the house, I was overcome with a feeling of welcome and comfort. Isolde and her mother lived in a small, yet comfortable home. Her mother seemed very hospitable, as she was already preparing a bed for me to sleep in. In their small kitchen, a large cauldron was strung over a big fireplace. The warm smell of a broth filled the air. Their kitchen also served as a living room. There was an elaborate rug on the floor, with a beautiful design of the Brittany symbol on it. As my eyes scanned the wall, I noticed a shield and a sword. I looked closer at it. The shield was very elaborate; it was painted black and had a ornate golden design on it. The sword was the longest one that I had ever seen. It was made of the purest silver I had ever seen, and the hilt was decorated with rubies, emeralds, and diamonds. \"Who could ever fight with such a sword? It is so ornate that it is almost impractical,\" I said underneath my breath. \"I hope that you feel welcome here, sir. I have made you a bed in our sewing room,\" the woman said as she walked over to me. \"Oh, I thank you. You have already made me feel welcome,\" I said as I turned to the woman. Isolde stood next to her. I could tell that she closely resembled her mother. This was when I realized that I never introduced myself. \"Forgive me, my lady, but my name is Tristan, Tristan of Cornwall,\" I said as I bowed. \"I am pleased to have met you, Tristan. My name is Isode,\" she said. She then looked up into my face. Her eyes looked bewildered and then utterly shocked. She gasped. \"What's wrong?\" I asked. \"Nothing,\" she said. She lifted her hand and stroked my cheek, and then she ran her fingers through my hair. Isode backed off a bit. \"Tristan, have I met you before?\" she asked. \"No, not that I can remember anyway,\" I said. Isolde looked at her mother and then at me. \"Mother, I am going to prepare the table,\" Isolde said. \"Yes, thank you,\" Isode replied. \"Tristan, may I speak with you for a moment?\" she asked. \"Yes, of course.\" She brought me to the next room, and she pulled up a chair for me to sit it. \"Tristan, how long have you lived in Cornwall?\" she asked. \"I've lived there my entire life. I do not know who my parents are or were, and a woman brought me to Cornwall from Brittany. There, she left me at a monastery, where the monks raised me until I was seven years of age. I left the monastery in order to become a knight. I don't know who my parents were, but the woman who brought me to Cornwall said that I was of noble birth. The blanket I was wrapped in as an infant was embroidered with the Brittany symbol. That's how the monks knew that I came from Brittany,\" I said. \"I see. Have you come here to find your parents?\" Isode said. I shook my head. \"No. I came here to learn the truth of what happened to Queen Iseult. This is my final test before knighthood,\" I said. She looked into my eyes. \"Do you happen to know any information that might help me?\" I asked. \"I'm not sure. I'll have to think,\" she said. For some reason, Isode seemed to become distressed after talking to me. \"I'm sorry if my story has disturbed you,\" I said. \"Oh, no! Don't apologize. I just need some time to think if I can help you,\" she said. \"We can eat now,\" Isolde said, walking into the room. \"Oh yes, dear. Come Tristan, we must eat,\" Isode said. I followed them to their table, and sat down to a meager meal of bread, water, and chicken soup. After we said the blessing before the meal, I began to ask questions about their home while we ate. \"So, how long have you lived in this house?\" I asked. \"Oh, for about five years now. I came to live here with Isolde because my second husband was rather cruel to her. I still visit him from time to time, so that I can see my other children,\" Isode said. \"Ah, I see,\" I said. \"I actually love living here in the forest. We used to live in the village, but everyone who lived there was so mean,\" Isolde said. \"Yes, I saw by the way they behaved today. It would never cross my mind to attack a defenseless maiden in order to steal her money,\" I said. Isolde laughed. \"Well, those boys in the street today aren't being trained to become knights, Tristan. There are many rude people in France. Even the knights aren't very noble,\" she said. I grinned. As I scanned the house, I wanted to learn about the sword and shield. \"Did that sword and shield belong to your husband?\" I asked. Isode seemed hesitant but said, \"Yes, it belonged to my first husband. He was a knight, and that was a shield he won in a jousting tournament,\" she said. \"Oh, jousting, I can't wait until I have my first jousting tournament. I've only helped my masters prepare for theirs. You know, I have to put on their chain mail, their armor, polish their swords,\" I said. \"Yes, I used to watch him. He often went to the Maiden's Castle,\" she said. \"Really? I've always wanted to go there. That's the castle where Sir Lancelot would joust, was it not?\" I asked. \"Yes, and my husband was even a favored knight of Sir Lancelot. Everyone seemed to have a great respect for him,\" Isode said. \"Your husband sounds like he was a very noble man,\" I said. \"He was,\" Isode said. I saw in the candlelight that her eyes were welling up with tears. I didn't mention anything else about her husband, for I did not want to upset her in any way. I was quiet for the rest of the meal. Afterwards, I helped Isolde clear the table, and then she brought me to the other room. She wanted to speak with me. \"I want to help you with your mission, Tristan. I have some connections,\" she said. \"What kind of connections?\" I asked. \"Well, this might sound absurd, but I know of a place where you can learn the exact truth of anything,\" Isolde said. \"Where is this place?\" I asked. \"It be a few days of walking. There, magical beings live, who know almost everything about the past. Legend has it that there is a fountain that can show you anything. You are supposed to drink of potion and then stick your head in the pool of water, and you will learn anything that you want to,\" Isolde said. \"I don't know if I can believe you,\" I said. \"Tristan, I've met people who have been to this palace. The fountain was enchanted by Merlin himself,\" she said. I signed. \"Well, I guess that I'll take your word for it. But I will be infuriated if your are lying to me,\" I said. \"I'm not lying. And besides, there are many knowledgeable people you can meet during the journey who can help you,\" Isolde said. \"I really don't have anything to lose. I'll follow you in the morning through the forest,\" I said. \"Thank you, Tristan,\" she said as she curtsied. \"Yes. I shall see you tomorrow,\" I said. She walked away, and I retreated to the small room that had been prepared for me. The bed was merely a small cot with some blankets, but Isode was kind enough to provide it for me. I sat on the cot and began to look through my sack. Eventually, I found my journal. Finding a quill pen and some ink, I began to write. I wrote about the grungy town of Brittany, how the people acted like savages, and my meetings with the woman at the orphanage and the baker. I ended my summary of the day by writing of Isolde, and how she welcomed me into her home. As I tried to fall asleep, my mind wandered back to Cornwall. I thought about my mission, Sir Matthew, and then an image of Rosetta entered my mind. I sat up in bed. Rosetta should be coming soon. Her boat was to leave the day after mine. I grew nervous at the thought. What if King Mark didn't allow her on the ship? What if she was sent on the wrong ship, and ended up in the Holy City instead of in Brittany? That had happened to other men before, since King Mark had sent several of his knights to Jerusalem in order to fight in the Crusades. However, since I had warned him, he might have put her on the wrong ship on purpose. I tried to assure myself that she would be alright, but I didn't find much comfort in that thought. However, I would lose my focus on my mission if I spent my time worrying about Rosetta. Trying to allow Rosetta to flee from my mind, I thought about tomorrow's journey with Isolde, and if the so-called \"magic fountain\" was true. A/N: So, did you like this? Was it good? Will Tristan and Isolde find the palace? Will Rosetta arrive in Brittany safely? And who was Isode's first husband? If you want to know, please review![Chapter 4] Disclaimer: I do not own the characters from Le Morte d' Arthur A/N: Well, I hope that people still like this. I'm accepting anonymous reviews. I didn't any hits of visitors for an entire week, so I'm wondering if people are getting bored with this story. Anyhow, I hope that you continue reading, because I'll continue writing. Also, the suspense is building in this chapter. In the morning, Isode prepared some eggs and bread for us to eat. \"I appreciate your hospitality, Isode. These eggs are excellent,\" I said, being somewhat of a toady. \"You're welcome. I have tried to make you feel comfortable during your stay here,\" she said. \"And you have succeeded,\" I said. Isolde laughed, and her mother looked puzzled. I knew that I had just responded in the stupidest way possible. Isode smiled at us. \"Well, I wish you the best of luck in your mission, Tristan. I wish that I could be of more help to you,\" Isode said. \"Mother, you aren't giving up that easily are you?\" Isolde asked. \"What do you mean?\" Isode asked. \"I told Tristan about the fountain last night. It may show him the truth of Queen Iseult,\" Isolde said. \"What fountain? I do not know of what you are speaking,\" Isode said. \"The fountain enchanted by Merlin, of course. It is said that if someone drinks a potion and sticks his head into the water, he will learn of his true heart's desire,\" Isolde said. \"Isolde, how do you know if that is true? Tristan is performing the most important mission for his knighthood, and you don't need to ruin it,\" she said. \"Mother, you told me that all the stories about Merlin are true! I can help him find the location! Please, let me aide him,\" Isolde begged. \"I do not want you to interfere with his affairs, for he is completing a very serious test in order to become a knight,\" Isode said. \"Please mother, I won't do him any harm in bringing him to the fountain. It will only help him!\" Isolde said. This is when I decided to intervene. \"Isolde will not bother me. And besides, I need all the help that I can find when it comes to learning of my parents. She can come,\" I said. Isode sighed. \"Alright, you can go with Tristan, but be cautious, Isolde. Only stay with Tristan and do not wander off with any other knight you might meet,\" she said. \"I promise that I'll be careful, mother,\" Isolde said. Then Isode turned to me. \"I am placing my trust in you, Tristan, that you will protect my daughter on your journey. And when you sleep you must stay twenty feet away from her,\" she said. My eyes widened when she said this and I said, \"You have my word, Isode. That would never cross my mind.\" \"Good, I trust that you are a noble knight, just like my husband was,\" she said. My eyes widened. \"What?\" I said. \"Nothing sir, nothing,\" she said, blushing. I wasn't convinced, but I didn't want to embarrass her by continuing the conversation. \"Isolde, pack a small sack of clothes and other things you may need. We shall leave shortly,\" I said. Isolde ran to her small room to begin packing. \"Tristan, I will give you two flasks of water. Once is for you, and the other is for Isolde. The water will last a long time if you use it sparingly. However, I know that there are several sanitary springs along the way to the fountain, so I've heard,\" Isode said as she handed me to bloated water flasks. \"Thank you so much, Isode. You have helped me in every possible way, and I thank you for welcoming me into your home, and treated me as if I were your own son,\" I said. \"Oh, you're welcome, Tristan. It is my pleasure to give back to the few people who have been so kind to us,\" Isode said. \"And I would also like to thank you for letting your daughter come with me. I know that she will help me greatly. You do not know how much fulfilling this mission means to me, not only to complete my training as a knight, but learning the truth of Queen Iseult could bring peace to Cornwall again. I promise you that I will take care of Isolde and protect her in every possible way,\" I said. \"Thank you so much, Tristan. You will become a very noble knight someday, and any woman would be lucky to have you as her husband,\" she said. She turned her head to her daughter who was approaching the doorway. Did she mean that she wanted me to marry Isolde? \"Yes, I hope that any woman would be happy with me, for I believe that I have already given my heart to a maiden back in Cornwall,\" I said. Isode looked shocked. \"Oh. Well, that's nice,\" she said. Isolde looked at her mother with a quizzical look. \"I'm ready to go now. Goodbye mother, I will be safe, and I promise that I will only travel with Tristan,\" she said. \"Oh, good luck to both of you! I'll miss you, Isolde. Be safe,\" Isode said as she pulled her daughter in her arms and kissed her forehead. \"I'll be fine, but I'll miss you too,\" Isolde said as she broke away from her, and ran after me. In the distance, I heard the sudden wailing of Isode as we ran from the house. It was sad for me to hear, for I had never known what it was like to have a mother, and I didn't know what it was like to leave a mother behind. By the time night fell, Isolde and I were deep into the woods. I started a fire, and we sat beside it. \"How are you doing, Isolde?\" I asked. \"Fine,\" she said as she sighed. \"Are you tired?\" \"Yeah. Walking all day is very exhausting,\" she said. \"I know,\" I said. Isolde pulled out a piece of bread that she had in her travel sack. \"Do you want some?\" she asked. \"No. I'm alright. I'll just have some water,\" I said. As we began to eat, night continued to fall, and the forest became unbearably dark. Everything was extremely quiet, and the only audible sounds were the slight crackle of the fire and the howl of a wolf in the distance. I heard Isolde gasp. \"Do not worry, Isolde. It is merely a wolf, and it is far away from us,\" I said. \"Tristan, I've never been in this forest at night before. Do you think that we will be safe?\" she said, with a strong tone of fear in her voice. \"Even if this forest isn't safe, you are safe with me,\" I said. \"Oh, thank you Tristan,\" she said. When the fire began to settle down, I realized how cold it was. Isolde wrapped her cloak tightly around her in an attempt to keep warm. \"We cannot get through the night without a fire. I need to get some more wood,\" I said. \"I'll go with you,\" Isolde said. \"Oh, you can stay here, there's no need for you to come with me,\" I said. However, I noticed the look in her eyes in the dim light. They were filled with worry and fear. Seeing her face reminded me of the last time I saw Rosetta before I left. Without thinking, I sat on the ground and held my head in my hands. How could I have forgotten about her all this time? She should have been here by now! I felt tears roll down my face. \"Oh Tristan! What is wrong? Did I say something?\" Isolde asked as she put her hand on my shoulder. \"Oh no, it's not you. I just remembered someone,\" I said. \"Who? Someone back in Cornwall?\" she asked. \"Yes, there was a maiden back in Cornwall who was supposed to leave for Brittany the day after me. She should have been here by now. I have this painful feeling that King Mark either didn't send her, and she was sent to the Holy City,\" I said. \"Jerusalem? How would she end up there?\" Isolde asked. \"It happens sometimes. King Mark has ships that sail to the Holy City to bring knights to fight in the Crusades. What if he purposely put her on one of those ships? She wouldn't know any better,\" I said. \"What is her name?\" Isolde asked. \"Rosetta,\" I said under my breath. \"She has a beautiful name. You love, Rosetta, don't you?\" she asked. I nodded. \"Yes. I wish to marry her but I will not ask her until I am knighted.\" \"Oh, you seem very wise and brave, Tristan,\" Isolde said. \"Thank you,\" I said. \"Well, I thought we were going to get more wood for the fire,\" she said as she sat up. \"You're right.\" So, we began to walk through the dark, picking up as many sticks as we could find. I heard a wolf howl again, and it sounded closer. Isolde froze. \"Tristan? I think that we should be heading back,\" she said. \"I agree,\" I said. As fast as our legs could carry us, Isolde and I ran back to where the fireplace was. We began to pile the sticks on top of the embers, in order to make a larger flame. \"I knew that someone was here,\" an oily voice said. Isolde screamed. I looked up. A middle-aged man and a group of thugs were encircled us. \"What do you want?\" I asked as I approached him. \"ATTACK!\" the man yelled. Suddenly, the thugs parted, and the man disappeared. I heard a stampede in the distance. Isolde quickly threw a few things into her travel sack and swung it over her shoulder. \"What is it, Tristan?\" she asked urgently. She was holding onto my arm tightly. \"We are being attacked. Run!\" I shouted. A pack of viscous wolf-like creatures ran after us. I grabbed Isolde's hand and ran as fast as I could with her. Yet to no avail, the wolves encircled us. \"Isolde, stand behind me. I'll take care of them,\" I said as I unsheathed my sword. \"You can't defeat them, there are too many of these creatures,\" she said as she hid behind me. I ran towards the creatures and began to fight them off. Although they possessed the appearance of a wolf, they had the teeth of a saber-toothed tiger and the claws of an eagle. At first, I was able to kill about five of these creatures, but many more came, and I received several slight wounds. \"Tristan! We must run! This is too dangerous!\" Isolde yelled. \"I'm fine! You go ahead and run! I'll meet up with you!\" I yelled. This battle was becoming intense. I had several cuts, which was causing me to grow weaker and weaker by the moment. Suddenly, I noticed that some of the wolves were being killed. Isolde came running by me with a sword and shield! \"Isolde! Why are you fighting?\" I asked. \"I had to help you! I stole my father's sword and shield from the wall before I left,\" she said. We continued to fight off the wolves together, until one clawed me in the abdomen, and I fell to the ground. \"AHHHH!\" I yelled as I covered my wound. \"Tristan!\" Isolde yelled. She turned her head to see where I had fallen. I wish that I hadn't screamed. After Isolde turned to look at me, a wolf violently struck her head with its paw, knocking her unconscious. \"No!\" I yelled. Despite my pain, I stood up and fought as many wolves as I could. I didn't last long; there were too many beasts, and blood was gushing from my abdomen, staining the grass below me. My legs collapsed beneath me, in the middle of all the wolves. This was it; I would die here, with the burden of not fulfilling my promise to a maiden's mother. If I died, Isolde would die as well. I couldn't imagine thinking of Isode when she received the news that Isolde had died in my care. Suddenly, I saw a white light in the distance. It grew bigger and brighter, spreading across the entire forest. The wolves screeched and ran away. As the white light faded, I saw a beautiful maiden in the distance, controlling the light. She smiled at me, then turned away. \"Tristan! Tristan!\" Isolde came running to my side. \"You're alright! Isolde, did you bring any remedies?\" I asked. \"Yes. Oh no, I didn't think you were wounded this bad,\" she said in a concerned voice. Isolde slowly poured water over my wound, which seemed to pierce deeper than my wound. I involuntarily let out a sickening scream, one that scared Isolde half to death. \"Damn you, wench!\" I yelled without thinking. She backed away from me. I soon regained consciousness. \"I'm sorry, Isolde. I didn't me to frighten you,\" I said. \"I didn't mean to hurt you, either. I was just trying to clean your wound,\" she said calmly. She tore her long sleeve and wrapped it tightly around my abdomen. This increased my pain as well, but I knew that it would help me heal. \"Do you feel any better?\" she asked. \"Not yet. This is the worst wound I've ever received. Tell me, are you advanced in the field of medicine?\" I asked. \"I am not, but my mother is. She has educated me throughout the years. You will be safe in my hands,\" Isolde said. I groaned as I lowered my head to the ground. \"Relax, Tristan. If you rest, you will heal quickly,\" Isolde said. \"I know. But it's hard to try to fall asleep when I'm feeling pain in every part of my body,\" I said. \"Every part of your body? Well, you should only be feeling pain in your abdomen, since that is where you were wounded. However, there could be more to the wound,\" Isolde said. \"No, it's just a wound. I'm only in pain because I was fighting those beasts with too much vigor. I've never worked that hard in my life,\" I said. \"Yes, maybe you're just exhausted. I know that I'm supposed to sleep twenty feet away from you, but I'm only going to be ten feet away from you tonight. I want to keep and eye on you, just to make sure you're alright,\" Isolde said. \"Thank you for your kindness, Isolde. And besides, I'm too injured to harm you in any way,\" I said. Isolde lightly laughed. That night, I woke up with a stabbing pain throughout my body. I let out a scream, and Isolde came running to my side. \"Tristan! Tristan! What is it?\" Isolde asked. I was in so much pain that I couldn't speak. Isolde removed my bandage, which added more pain. She let out a scream as well. \"Oh Tristan, I'm so sorry!\" she said. \"What is it? What's wrong?\" I forced myself to ask. Isolde bent down and stroked my forehead. Tear were in her eyes. \"Oh Tristan, it is as I feared. You've been poisoned,\" she said. \"NO! I can't be! I must finish my mission! I have a duty to Cornwall!\" I yelled. \"I know! I don't know how to cure you! My mother would know! I wish she were here with us, but we are so far away,\" she said. \"I need to get help,\" I said. \"I could try to run home as fast as I could, and get my mother,\" she said. I grabbed her arm. \"No! It is inappropriate for a young maiden to travel alone! I will be fine!\" I said. \"No! NO! You won't! I've seen this poison kill the strongest men before. In fact, my mother cured my father from this exact poison!\" Isolde said. I looked at her with a puzzled face. \"I wish I could help you, Tristan. I'll try to remember what my mother told me,\" Isolde said. She pulled a few different remedies from her sack, and mixed them together. In another excruciating session, Isolde gently rubbed a burning potion onto my wound. I involuntarily screamed, but Isolde ignored me and finished the process. \"How do you feel now?\" she asked. \"Awful,\" I said underneath my breath. Then, I went unconscious. A/N: So, how did I do? Who was the lady in the white light? And will Tristan be able to recover from his wound and complete his mission? It will all be revealed soon. And don't forget to review! Reviews keep me motivated to write![Chapter 5] Disclaimer: I still don't own Le Morte d'Arthur. These disclaimers are starting to get wicked annoying. A/N: I'm back! Sorry about the long wait. I had other fanfics I wanted to work on. Did Tristan survive? Who was the woman in the forest? Was Isolde able to find help? You will find the answers if you read! As soon as I regained consciousness, I realized that I wasn't in the forest anymore. Instead, I was in a tent. \"Oh, where am I?\" I asked as I rubbed my eyes. \"He lives!\" a man's voice said. I slowly sat up, and then tried to remember what I could before I passed out. All I could remember was Isolde pouring water onto my wound and screaming in pain. For some reason, I wasn't feeling any pain in my abdomen. \"Who are you, sir?\" I asked. \"I am Gouvernail, at your service. I am a retired knight and some of my friends and I travel across France, helping those in need.\" \"I am pleased to meet you, Gouvernail. I am Tristan,\" I said. His eyes widened. \"It is a pleasure meeting you, Tristan. We found you and that young maiden in the forest one night and we healed your wound,\" he said. \"What? One night? How long have I been unconscious?\" I asked. \"Three days,\" Gouvernail said. \"Three days! Why didn't you wake me? I'm on a tight schedule, and I've just wasted three days, all because I had to heal from a wound! I could have traveled while the wound was healing! I am performing my final test in order to become a knight!\" I said with anger. \"Tristan, calm down. You needed to heal. Besides, you'll have plenty of time left because we will help you with your mission. That young maiden told me that you had a month for your mission,\" Gouvernail said. Then it hit me. \"Isolde! Is she alright?\" I asked. I didn't wait for him to answer my question. Quickly, I threw a tunic over my head and girded my sword to my waist. I ran from my tent. \"Tristan! Wait!\" Gouvernail yelled. \"Isolde! Isolde where are you!\" I yelled. \"I'm right here,\" she said calmly. She was sitting by the fire pit with another woman with silver hair and pale skin, who was cooking. \"Are you alright, Isolde?\" I asked. \"Yes, I'm perfectly fine, Tristan. I'm glad to see that you have recovered,\" she said. \"I'm well again. We must not linger here, we need to get to the fountain as soon as possible,\" I said. \"Ah, do not be hasty, Tristan. Sit down and eat. You haven't eaten in three days after all,\" the woman said. I looked around at my surroundings and realized that we were on a beach. \"How did we get here?\" \"We brought you two here. It is safe here by the beach. Hardly anyone knows that there is a passage to the ocean in this forest,\" the woman said. \"That's a shame. It's so beautiful out here. Whoever knew that the forest would lead to a beach,\" Isolde said. The woman stood up and walked to me. \"I should have introduced myself earlier. I am Brangwayne,\" she said. \"I am pleased to meet you, Brangwayne. I thank you for taking care of Isolde and I,\" I said. \"Ah, that is my job now. I am glad to see that you have healed properly,\" she said \"Yes, thank you for curing my wound,\" I said. \"Oh, I didn't do that, my concubine cured your wound,\" Brangwayne said. \"Where is she?\" I asked. \"She is not here at the present moment. She had to leave right after she cured you, because she had some business to take care of,\" she said. \"Oh. Please tell her I will be forever grateful that she cured me. Without her, I would have been dead,\" I said. \"I will, but I probably won't see her for a long time,\" Brangwayne said. She then placed some green beans on a wooden plate for me. \"Here, I just cooked these. You'll need your strength,\" she said. I sat down and ate the beans, which didn't taste that bad. Eventually, Gouvernail caught up with us. \"So, I believe that after everyone is done eating, we can continue our journey to the fountain,\" he said. \"Do you really know where the exact location of the fountain is?\" I asked. \"Why of course. We always go there. We work there,\" Brangwayne said. \"How do I know that I can trust you?\" I asked. \"Oh, you'll learn to trust us. We have proof of how you can trust us,\" Gouvernail said. \"Then prove your worthiness to me,\" I said. Gouvernail showed me his sword. On the hilt was the symbol of Cornwall. \"Did you really come from Cornwall?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" \"How do I know that you're not lying?\" I asked. \"Tristan, I am holding in my hand the sword of a noble knight of Cornwall. The only way I could get one of these is by becoming a knight in Cornwall. Surely you know that,\" he said calmly. \"Yes, I do, but I'm just being cautious. I myself am from Cornwall and-\" \"You are trying to learn the truth about King Mark's wife,\" Gouvernail said. \"Well. . .yes. I have been given the mission of learning the truth of Queen Iseult as my final knightly challenge,\" I said. \"I'll tell you now, Tristan. When it comes to learning the truth of the Queen of Cornwall or of another person's heritage, no one will know more than Brangwayne and I,\" Gouvernail said. \"Really?\" I asked. \"Will you trust us?\" he said as he held out his hand. I didn't know what to do. Part of me wanted to trust him while the other part of me didn't want to trust him. However, he seemed to be telling the truth, and had proven that he was a native of Cornwall. I made my decision and shook hands with him. \"I'll trust you,\" I said. \"Very good. Now, just follow us and we'll arrive at the fountain in no time,\" Gouvernail said. Isolde stayed close next to me. I wondered if she didn't trust Gouvernail. As we walked across the shore, Isolde pulled on my arm. \"Tristan, do you see that in the distance?\" she asked. I looked straight ahead. A boat was washed up on the shore. \"It's a boat,\" I said. \"Yes, I wonder why it's here. Maybe someone was following us,\" she said. I ran towards it, and Isolde tried to follow me. I inspected the small rowboat, looking for symbols. There was nothing inside of the boat, but I eventually felt something on the right side. \"I've found something,\" I said. \"What is it?\" Isolde asked. I looked closer at the symbol engraved into the boat. It was the symbol of Cornwall! Just then, I fell backwards. Rosetta! How could I have forgotten you? \"NO!\" I yelled. \"What is the commotion?\" Gouvernail asked. \"This boat came from Cornwall, and was possibly carrying someone who is very important to me,\" I said. \"Well the boat is stuck in the sand fairly well, so I think that whoever was in the boat made it to the land,\" Gouvernail said. Just then, I noticed something sparkle in the boat. I bent down and saw that it was a blue gem. Picking it up, I soon discovered that it was a bracelet. I examined the bracelet for a moment, and tried to look for any symbols on it. But I found nothing; it was merely a golden band with a blue gem in the center. \"Gouvernail, I believe that you are correct. This bracelet obviously belongs to a women and there is a chance that she is the one I am looking for,\" I said. \"Now Tristan, you must focus on your knightly duties first. We will probably find your friend as we travel,\" Gouvernail said. \"That isn't good enough. Part of being a knight is saving those who I truly love,\" I said. \"Tristan, calm down for a moment. I just saw footprints in the distance, and they looked fresh. They probably landed here last night or the day before. They shouldn't be far from here,\" Gouvernail said. \"Alright, I hope that they aren't far. But I will never stop searching for her as we travel,\" I said. No matter how Gouvernail seemed to reassure me, I wasn't convinced. I wouldn't be able to rest until I found Rosetta and saw that she was safe. As we continued, I examined the footprints. I could definitely tell they were the footprints of a woman, and footprints of a man wearing boots. They seemed to be fresh; Gouvernail was right about that. I just needed to convince my companions to follow their footprints, so that I could find Rosetta. After all, we shouldn't get that of course, since Gouvernail and Brangwayne knew how to get to the fountain anyways. I purposely got ahead of everyone, continuing to seek out the footprints. As we entered the forest, they became more difficult to see, since the ground was hard and footprints weren't made easily. Eventually, I couldn't see the footprints anymore, and my hope began to dwindle. \"I know that you were trying to lead us away from the planned trail, Tristan. These woods are rather simple, and I promise you that we will find your friend,\" Gouvernail said. \"I wish I could assure myself that you are telling the truth,\" I said. \"Tristan, everything I saw is true. I know these woods because I travel them often. Your friend will be found before you know it,\" Gouvernail said. I hung my head low and didn't respond. I was feeling rather depressed right now. I could only wish that Rosetta was safe. What worried me the most was that I didn't know who the knight was that traveled with her. \"Tristan, look,\" Isolde said as she pointed into the distance. I looked up and saw a fire pit, with smoke coming from it. I ran to the pit. \"The fire is still fresh. It must have been put out this morning,\" I said as I felt the rocks around it. They were still very hot. \"Well, maybe Rosetta is around here,\" Isolde said as I tried to cool off my hand. \"Do you think that we could spare some of that water?\" I asked Isolde. Just then, Brangwayne walked over to me. \"This will work better than ordinary water,\" she said. She pulled a flask from her sack and poured a potion on my hand. Instantly, the burn was healed. \"Wow, what was that?\" I asked. \"Just a little potion,\" Brangwayne said. When she turned her back, I examined the ground to look for footprints. I didn't see any. \"Ah, I hope that the former travelers didn't turn to the left. That is very dangerous. Anyone who turns left could die from the poisonous air that lingers in that part of the forest. If they are fortunate enough to survive they will be rescued by healers like us. If we find anyone who is hurt, we bring them to our private camp to be cured,\" Gouvernail said. \"We will be visiting the camp on our way. Perhaps I can teach you two some simple healing tips,\" Brangwayne said. So, we went right instead of left. The path was very simple, but boring. After a long time, I began to feel myself starting to sleep. But I couldn't let myself be tired; I was in a coma for three days and I needed time to catch up. I couldn't waste time. However, the day whizzed by, and the forest became dark once again. \"We shall stop here, for it is safe to make a fire,\" Gouvernail said. \"Alright, I can sleep,\" Isolde said. Just as it was the last night I could remember, the forest was extremely cold. Once the fire was lit, Isolde sat right next to me and laid her head on my shoulder. I began to feel a bit awkward at her advance, but I didn't think that she meant any harm. \"Tristan, I'm cold. I don't mean to be impolite,\" Isolde said. \"No, that's fine,\" I said. However, I knew that Isolde had feelings for me after these few days together. It was rather obvious, because she would follow me everywhere, and her eyes widened when she looked at me. Isolde was an extremely kind girl, but I didn't have feelings for her as I did with Rosetta. For some reason, I could only think of her as if she were my younger sister. After Gouvernail and Brangwayne found places to sleep, Isolde stayed by the fireside with me. She seemed to want to tell me something. \"Tristan, you really do love Rosetta, don't you?\" she asked. \"Yes. I want her to be my wife someday. That is, if she's safe. After I finish this mission and become a knight, I will propose to her. Once we get married, we'll find a beautiful place to live in the mountains. I'll build her a house, and then we'll have children,\" I said. \"Wow, you seem to have your life planned,\" she said. \"That is, if everything falls into place. I need to find Rosetta first. I'm not quite sure if she loves me. However, she accepted me when I asked to be her knightly protection,\" I said. Isolde was trying to hold back tears at this point. \"Tristan . . . What do you think. . .\" she trailed off. She couldn't tell me. \"Yes?\" I asked. \"Nothing, it's nothing,\" she said. I sighed \"You should get some rest, you're just exhausted,\" I said. She nodded and stood up to return to her tent. A/N: I decided to give you guys a shorter chapter this time. I'm sorry about the late update.

Charlie Kate's bf he's been caught getting into over 18 clubs and getting absolutely stoned heaps but his dad is the head of the town so he gets off so easily it is so good for him.

The best behaved out of all of us would be Kate then the worst would be Mat. I choose all the best parties to go to and I scoop out all the best clubs and I know the clubs that the bouncers don't really check Id's because they just don't care and more money in their pockets I guess that's what they are thinking. I've got to make a big decision today go to school or not. Might as well go just to p all the teachers off. They hate me mother and father have gotten heaps of phone calls. I'm hosting the next party tonight as mother and father have told me they are having a night off from me and not gonna be back till 2:00p.m tomorrow cool as it's the weekend I am going to go insane and have a 24 hour party! YES the best party you could imagine. I'll just get Codes to go and get me some alcohol for the night. He's 19 and he hangs around us because he is Mat's older bro. I wish I had such a cool and hot brother. Don't let Mat hear me say that! He will lose it and go anti on his bro. We need the drinks for parties so I don't want to lose him. HAHAHA.

Mat and I went outside to be alone and Mat said that he loved me. It's the first time that he has said it without being totes stoned. I knew he loved me but him saying it and meaning it is awesome. I told him I loved him back. Now we are dancing crazy and going hyper. I think that is what you call it. What was that noise? Hang on S*** my parents are home but they said they wouldn't be back.

I've been away for a while. Haha, sorry to anyone who misses me. Writer's block, exams, all that stuff. I dunno how good it is. It's a teensy bit deeper than my usual stuff. I can't promise anything else at this stage. I guess we shall see. Lonny was in his usual spot on the couch. The TV was on, and Dennis was at his desk, scratching away at the seemingly endless amount of paperwork that had built up over the course of a week. Lonny had been complaining about back pain, and had been on the couch most of the day. Actually, he'd been complaining about back pain for a while. He'd been sick a couple of times as well, although Dennis suspected this was due Lonny's frequent hangovers. What worried Dennis more than anything was Lonny's loss of appetite. The brunette was usually always hungry, and happy to eat anything that was put in front of him. But recently, he'd only picked at his food and claimed that he wasn't hungry. As a result, he was losing weight rapidly. Dennis was terrified that Lonny would eventually starve himself to death, but he honestly couldn't think of anything that would force his usually happy-go-lucky lover's health to deteriorate so rapidly. A doctor's appointment had been scheduled for the following day, and until then, Dennis was left to fret and worry while Lonny slept even more than usual to escape the pain. Lonny continued to insist that everything was fine and that he'd probably injured his back somehow and that he'd soon be fine. However, the doctors said otherwise. Lonny went to the doctor's appointment alone, since Dennis had so much work to do, and Lonny was almost grateful. Dennis had already decided not to make a big deal out of it, and not pounce on Lonny the moment he walked through the door. \"Have you eaten anything?\" Dennis asked when Lonny entered the apartment, already forgetting the 'don't pounce on him' plan. Lonny shook his head. \"No, um-\" \"Look, I know you're not hungry and all of that, but you're losing weight. I think the reason you've been feeling sick is because you haven't eaten.\" \"Dennis-\" Lonny said so quietly that his lover barely heard him. \"Stacee's playing tonight. He's worried about you. He wanted to check that you're ok.\" \"I'm not.\" \"Huh?\" \"Dennis,\" Lonny sighed. How the hell could he break this gently? \"What's up?\" Dennis questioned. He knew he wasn't going to make a big deal out of the whole doctor's appointment, but Lonny was kind of starting to freak him out. Lonny's eyes were about to brim over with tears. He hadn't been this terrified in a long time. \"Lon?\" Dennis said uncertainly. Ok, now he was scared. \"Dennis, I have liver cancer. They reckon it's self-inflicted, and unless I qualify for a transplant, I've got about seven months. They reckon if we'd spotted the symptoms, loss of appetite, back pain, weakness, weight loss and so on sooner, my chances of survival would be higher.\" Dennis just stared as his brain processed the information. Liver cancer, seven months, self-inflicted? How... the drinking. It had to be the drinking. Loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness... Lonny had been sleeping more than ever, he barely ate, and he'd definitely lost weight. But it couldn't be true. Could it? No. Not Lonny. Not his Lonny. Lonny didn't deserve this. In his whole life, he'd barely been in a fight, he was friendly to almost everyone, he wouldn't hurt a fly. This had to be a practical joke. \"You're kidding. This is a joke, right? I knew you had a sick sense of humour, but come on. Tears and everything?\" \"Dennis, I'm not kidding. Believe me, I wish I was joking.\" He bit his lip to stifle a sob. Finally, it hit Dennis like a ton of bricks. Dennis was usually the calm one of their relationship. However, forgetting that Lonny probably needed Dennis to be calm, he hurled himself at the brunette, wrapping his arms around the most important person in his world. \"I love you. Lonny, don't leave me. Please.\" \"Dennis, what if I die?\" Dennis grabbed Lonny by the wrists and stared him straight in the eyes. \"Don't you dare say that. I don't care what happens, I don't care what I have to do, you're going to be fine. Do you hear me?\" There were two hours left before the Bourbon was supposed to open. Knowing he couldn't let the now crying Lonny go into work, they ended up curling up next to each other in bed until Lonny fell asleep. That's the first part. There's more if you guys want it. I'll end up posting the rest at some point anyway.[Chapter 2] Finally! The second bit! Haha! Sorry about the wait but I wanted to see if anyone actually wanted me to continue. Thank you so much to I-Emma-Writer, OnyxFlames and rimaryan for following, reviewing, favouriting, etc. Dennis now had an hour until the Bourbon opened. Stacee Jaxx would be arriving any minute for sound check, and so would Drew and Sherrie. How was Dennis supposed to break the news to them? What if Lonny didn't qualify for a transplant? A polite knock on the door of the office indicated the presence of either Sherrie or Constance, since Drew would've called out and Stacee wouldn't have even bothered to walk all the way up to the office before going to his dressing room. Dennis didn't bother to make sure he looked presentable, because he knew he probably didn't, and he didn't care. Sherrie gasped slightly as Dennis opened the door. He looked awful. Despite his rumpled clothes, his eyes were red rimmed, almost like he'd been crying. But that was ridiculous. Unless... \"Is everything ok?\" Dennis shook his head. \"Where's Lonny? Is he alright?\" Dennis shook his head again. \"No, he's not ok. Can you get the others up here for a second? We need to talk.\" Sherrie nodded slowly, an uneasy feeling forming in her stomach. A few moments later, Sherrie, Drew, Stacee, Constance and Dennis sat around in the office. They sat in silence for a while. Stacee took a swig from a half empty bottle of vodka before offering it to Dennis, who shook his head. Figuring that Lonny would not be permitted to drink, Dennis had decided to go easy on the alcohol too, in order to make it easier on his partner. Of course, it was never going to be easy when he worked and lived in a nightclub. \"What's up?\" Drew asked, he was starting to get worried. He hadn't seen Dennis upset like this since, well, ever. \"Where's Lonny?\" Constance questioned, suddenly pinpointing why the room was so quiet. \"He's in the other room, sleeping.\" Dennis replied, \"H-he's sick.\" The room fell into silence once again. Apart from frequent hangovers, Lonny was never ill. \"How sick?\" Stacee ventured after a moment. Dennis sighed. \"He hasn't been looking too well recently. He hasn't been eating, and he's been sick a couple of times, so I told him to go to the doctor.\" \"And?\" Sherrie asked gently. \"He has liver cancer. If he doesn't qualify for a transplant, he has seven months.\" His voice cracked at the end of the sentence, fighting back emotion in front of his friends. Everyone was shocked. \"H-how?\" Drew sputtered. \"The drinking. They think it was the drinking.\" Dennis responded blankly. Stacee let the bottle of vodka slip from his hand and smash onto the floor. No one noticed. \"But, he'll qualify for a transplant won't he? He'll be fine right?\" Sherrie asked with raised eyebrows. Dennis shrugged. Stacee turned to Constance, who was currently Arsenal's manager. \"Cancel the rest of the tour, book us into the first hotel with a vacancy. We're not going anywhere.\" Constance nodded. \"How is he?\" Drew asked. \"Scared.\" Dennis replied, suddenly regretting his decision to give up the booze. He didn't even get to say goodbye... \"Do you think you should maybe close up shop, just for tonight anyways?\" Sherrie asked. None of them felt in the mood to perform anymore. Dennis nodded. \"Yeah, I think I will. Could you go downstairs and send everyone home?\" \"With pay?\" \"Sure.\" Sherrie and Drew left the office to send everyone home, and Constance left to start working out hotel arrangements, among other things. That left the two rock'n'roll brothers alone in the office. \"…And how are you feeling?\" Stacee asked. \"How do you think I'm feeling?\" Dennis snapped, \"I've never been so scared in my entire life!\" Dennis threw the first thing he found, an ashtray, across the room in frustration. \"Easy, easy. Calm down. You don't wanna wake him up, do you?\" Dennis sighed and sat down in his desk chair. \"No. I just got him to sleep.\" They both grinned. They often made passing jokes about the fact that Dennis spent most of his time parenting Lonny. \"Look, chances are, he'll qualify for a transplant. And then you'll just have to look after him a little more than usual. That's all.\" \"And if he doesn't?\" \"You can't afford to think like that.\" \"Yeah. I know, it's just-\" \"I know. Look, why don't you go downstairs, use the payphone, and call his family or something.\" Stacee suggested. \"…I'd rather use the phone in here.\" \"And risk Lonny overhearing you? Go. I'll look after him.\" Dennis nodded. \"You're right. Thanks.\" Stacee sauntered into the other room, and stared at Lonny. He looked surprisingly pale. The rock god smiled a little, remembering the first few years he'd known the brunette. They hadn't gotten on brilliantly at first, and Stacee blamed himself for that. He could've at least got the kid's name right, and maybe stopped calling him a kid. But Stacee liked to think of himself as the first one to work out Lonny and Dennis' real feelings for each other. It was, in Stacee's opinion, rather obvious. It was the way they looked at each other when the other wasn't looking. If Dennis spoke, Lonny gave him his undivided attention, most of the time, and Dennis had always had a protective streak when it came to Lonny. Stacee's thoughts were interrupted when Lonny stirred, and half opened one eye. \"Dennis?\" Stacee chuckled. \"Wrong brother.\" \"Stacee? \"Yeah. Dennis is downstairs. Calling your folks I think.\" Stacee spoke in his usual tone, he sounded as though nothing was wrong, and Lonny was grateful. He didn't feel like pity at the moment. But it quickly sunk in that Stacee was acting as a babysitter, and Lonny frowned at the thought. \"He doesn't want me to be alone.\" It wasn't a question, but Stacee still nodded in confirmation. \"Yeah. Drew and Sherrie are sending everyone, with pay I think. And Constance is organising hotels and stuff.\" \"You're staying?\" Lonny asked, mildly surprised. \"Yeah. I think we should.\" Stacee moved to sit in one of the dining chairs in the kitchen, about five steps away from the bed. It was a small apartment, but Lonny and Dennis never complained. It served its purpose. \"You don't have to.\" Lonny muttered guiltily. \"We want to.\" Stacee said simply, \"When a family member's sick, you make sacrifices.\" \"You shouldn't.\" Lonny protested, \"Really, you shouldn't. You should keep touring. Dennis'll keep you posted and-\" Stacee held up one hand to silence his friend, \"We're staying.\" Lonny sighed and let his head flop back against the pillow – Dennis' pillow – and inhaled the scent with a smile. The panic of the day had exhausted him, and as he drifted off to sleep he absent-mindedly wondered if anyone had cried. Well, I hope I didn't disappoint the people who have been waiting for ages. Lol. I have a little more of the story left but it's pretty far from completed. So whether this'll ever be finished or not is hard to say. ","Summary":" Hmm. I've been away for a while.

So I've decided to try to write one. This is set in modern times and in a high school setting. I thought it would be cool to see how Constance and Stacee would be like when they were in high school. I hope you enjoy it! By the way I don't own anything,* I walked into school just like any other day. I see my best friend Anna struggling to open her locker as usual. I go to her and grab her pile of books so she can properly open her locker, \"Thanks Constance.\" \"Did you start the report for English class?\" I ask as she takes the books from my hands. \"No, but I bet you did , Miss Responsible.\" \"Of course I did , Miss Slacker.\" Anna and I are polar opposites. She procrastinates down to the minute and I'm the one who turns in things a week before they're even assigned. I know what I want to do with my life and she doesn't even know what she wants for lunch. \"Let's go before we're late for homeroom.\" Anna says as she slams her locker shut. \"Oh my gosh Constance! Your hair is wild today!\" She exclaims running her hand through my hair. \"I know. It's getting ridiculous.\" \"AHH! There's Mark! I love him\" \"Oh please, Anna. Yesterday you loved Tom from Biology.\" \"Love is a fickle thing my dear and Mark is in a band!\" Yes Mark is in a band. A rocker band to be exact. The band consists of 3 others. Joe, Brandon, and Steven. Steven who now insists on be called Stacee is the lead singer. They're all druggies or at least I hope they are with some of the spaced out stuff they say. \"Anna! He's a bad influence.\" \"Constanceeeeeeeeeeee! Stop playing it safe and live on the wild side for once.\" \"No thanks. He probably doesn't even know you exist.\" \"Oh yeah? Then why are Mark and Stacee walking this way?\" \"Maybe it's because we're standing in front of the guy's bathroom?\" I say sarcastically. \"Eww. No wonder it smells like urinal cakes!\" Anna says as she scrunches her nose in disgust. \"Oh, I thought it was your perfume!\" As I say that I notice Stacee and Mark laughing. \"Hey, um Anna. You might not know me but I'm...\" \"MARK! I mean. Yeah I know who you are.'' She stutters. \"Well I'm Constance but since no one cares I'm going to homeroom.\" I throw my back pack on my shoulder and start to head to homeroom. I feel someone walking beside me and out of the corner of my eye I see Stacee, \"I'm Stacee by the way. Sophmore. Lead singer of Arsenal. Extremely talented and hot.\" \"And I don't care.\" \"Wow. Harsh much?\" \"Look I already know who you are. I think the whole god dam school knows who you are.\" \"What's that supposed to mean , Cinderella?\" \"It's Constance and I mean that you parade yourself around the school like some amazing rock legend but you're not!\" I say frustrated. \"Not yet.\" \"See! That's what I mean. You need to deflate that ego of your's.\" Stacee then grabbed my wrist and pulled me so we were face to face with each other. \"Thank you for being honest. I like that. I like you. In fact I've liked you since 8th grade, Constance Sack.\" He says looking into my eyes. \"You... You know my name?\" \"I know everything about you.\" \"Stacee?\" \"Hmm?\" \"That sounds sort of stalkerish.\" We both laugh. \"Go out with me?\" He asks.[Chapter 2] Junior Year \"Stacee you're being ridiculous!\" \"Give me one good reason why!\" I could give him twenty reasons to why it wasn't a good idea to run away to LA. I guess I forgot to mention Sophmore year. Well I did decide to go out with Stacee but it took some persuading on his part to make me even want to consider dating him. Anna and Mark broke up and that caused a rift in our friendship. I'm always hanging out with Stacee and that means that Mark is there. I miss Anna and still talk to her but not like we used to. \"STACEE WE ARE 17 AND STILL IN HIGHSCHOOL!\" \"And your point is?\" \"My point is that we both wouldn't finish high school which means we won't have jobs and that will cause us to be homeless!\" \"But we'd have each other, Babe. Plus my music career is going to take off.\" \"So when I'm starving I can eat your arm and use your skin for a jacket?\" \"Constance that's just gross.\" \"Steven! It's true. No matter how much I love you I refuse to go to LA with you. I have a chance for a full scholarship and I'm not throwing that away.\" \"You love me?\" He asks as he puts his hand on the side of my face. \"Of course I do! Why do you think I put up with your antics?\" \"I love you Constance.\" \"I know but I'm still not going to LA with you.\" \"The guys and I are leaving tonight at 8. Come if you want.\" \"I'll see you Stacee.\" It's a short walk to my house. I open the door to my house. Run up the stairs and flop onto my bed. I can't leave. Sure my parents wouldn't even notice that I'm gone but that means I'll have no way to get a decent job. Why am I even considering this? Of course I can't go! I am a rational person. Then I look at my nightstand and see the picture. The picture of Stacee and me at the semi formal. He actually put on a dress shirt. At the bottom of the frame he wrote \"I want to know what love is. I want you to show me.\" That's when I decide. I grab my suitcase from the closet and start packing clothes. I take the pictures of Anna and me that were on my wall and put them in my purse. I put the frame on top of the pile of clothes and slam the lid shut. I race down the stairs and out the door. I see the guys loading their stuff the beat up car that Mark owns. I hear them talking. \"Looks like Constance is a no show, Stacee.\" \"She still has 5 minutes, Mark. She's coming. I know she is.\" Stacee replied almost desperate. \"Gosh, Mark. It's like you have no confidence in me whatsoever.\" I say sarcastically. \"I knew you'd come!\" Stacee said as he pulled me in for a kiss. \"Enough of that. Let's head out for LA!\" Brandon screamed. We all got into the car. Hopefully this wasn't a huge mistake.

Please believe me! I promise you I didn't write those emails! I mean not all of it anyway. I wouldn't do that to you! Yeah you were my ticket out of here, but that was before I actually fell in love with you!\" Poppy said in between sobs. God I hated seeing her like this. But she broke my heart. I still love her. I long to comfort her. But I shouldn't show weakness. \"What do you mean \"I didn't write all of it\"? You wrote some of it? Why would you Poppy?\" I asked sad \"Because.\"she started. She took a deep breath and I realized she was crying. \"I wrote on them on my second week here. I hated this place! I was use to the sun and warmth and then I come here and the sun is gone and it rains constantly. Freddie, please believe me! I love this place! And more importantly. I love you.\" she said, practically whispered Did I here that correctly? Poppy Moore just said she loved me! And not in response to me saying it. She actually meant it. I had prayed she would tell me just once that she loved me. And now she tells me. While we are fighting! God she really is trouble! \"Troub..Poppy, what did you just say?\" I had to make sure. \"I love you Freddie!\" she said as she burst into tears Poppy's Point of View (PPOV) \"Freddie! Please believe me! I promise you I didn't write those emails! I mean not all of it anyway. I wouldn't do that to you! Yeah you were my ticket out of here, but that was before I actually fell in love with you!\" I said as I I felt the tears prickling. Freddie was so hurt. Whoever wrote those emails had some serious explaining. Not only did they make me lose my first real friends, they also made me lose the only guy I have ever loved. I could see he was having some sort of mental debate with himself. It was killing me. I love him so much. OMG! I have never told him that! He had always said it and I would say it back. I never said it first. \"What do you mean \"I didn't write all of it\"? You wrote some of it? Why would you Poppy?\" he finally said sad. I knew he was sad. He didn't call me trouble. \"Because.\" I started, but I could feel the tears in my eyes. I took a deep breath that sounded like I was crying. \"I wrote on them on my second week here. I hated this place! I was use to the sun and warmth and then I come here and the sun is gone and it rains constantly. Freddie, please believe me! I love this place! And more importantly. I love you.\" I said, whispered. I wasn't sure if he heard me. I hoped he did. \"Troub...\" he started \"Poppy what did you just say?\" he asked me. So close to calling me trouble. \"I love you Freddie!\" I repeated and broke into tears[Chapter 2] A/N: hey all. Sorry this is a really short chapter. I thought it was longer than it is when wrote it. Please read and review!!!!!!!! Isabella Jame Swan Cullen Chapter 2 FPOV I couldn't leave her like that. She was crying. My Poppy was sad. And I was to blame. I wanted so badly to comfort her. My better instinct took over and I found myself holding her. The minute she was in my arms started to calm down. \"It's OK Trouble.\" I said. I smiled as she hugged me closer when I called her Trouble. \"I meant it though,\" she said as she put her head in the crook of my neck and inhaled my scent. \"Meant what?\" \"I love you!\" she said as she turned her head to look me in the eye. \"I love you too Trouble.\" I replied staring into her eyes. And with that she stood on her toes and put her lips to mine. The moment our lips touched, my mental debate ended. I tilted my head down and she lowered onto flat feet. I moved one hand to her hair and the other on her back. I felt her put both her hands around my neck and intertwine them in my hair. I could taste her luscious cherry lip gloss and knew I was in heaven. As we deepened the kiss, I thought of trying something we had never tried. I licked her bottom lip and she opened her mouth. The minute it opened my tongue was in her mouth. She was everywhere! I could taste her breathe in my throat. Nothing else existed. We broke apart for air and she pulled herself closer to me. \"Freddie? Can we go somewhere private?\" she asked \"Of course Trouble,\" I replied as I took her hand and led her to my car. We drove into town and went to our spot on the beach once we sat down, we picked up from where we left off. I was in heaven. The sun started to set and I pulled away. \"We should head back Trouble,\" I said \"Can't we stay a little longer?\" she asked as she kissed me. God, she could be very persuasive in her kisses. I wanted to stay there forever and kiss her. \"No we can't Trouble,\" I said as I stood up. \"The sun has started to set, and my mother will notice if I'm not at dinner.\" I continued as I pulled her up. \"Fine.\" she said as she pouted. \"I guess Harriet will notice if I'm not there. So we should go.\" We drove back to Abbey Mount and got there just as the girls were piling in. It was good timing. Poppy wouldn't be noticed and my mother and the rest of the teachers hadn't entered yet. Poppy gave me a quick kiss then went to find the girls I went to find mom.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 PPOV Freddie and I spent hours at our spot on the beach. We hugged and kissed. I was so glad he had forgiven me. I had to find the girls and thank them. Without them I wouldn't of gone after Freddie and god only knows what the outcome could be. He might be with Harriet. We walked into the hall just in time. The other girls had only just started piling in. So I wouldn't be noticed walking in and Freddie wouldn't in trouble. I gave him a quick kiss and went to find the girls. As soon as I found them the questions started. \"Where have you been?\" \"What happen?\" \"Is operation 'Get Freddie Back' complete?\" I didn't know who sad what. Except the last question. That was Kiki. \"OMG guys! I've been with Freddie-\" I started \"This whole time?\" Drippy cut in \"Yes Drippy. This whole time. We talked and sorted everything out,\" I said suggestively \"Tell us everything!\" Kiki said I retold the girls I could before the teachers, prefects and of course Freddie walked in. we stood up as they did so. As soon as Freddie entered, his eyes scanned the room for me. When we made eye contact, he smiled. I smiled back. \"Lover boy is looking this way,\" Drippy said \"Shut up Drippy!\" Kate said \"Uh oh!\" Josie said \"What?\" everyone said \"'arriet\" she said \"That's OK. Freddie wont fall for her tricks.\" I said \"Freddie doesn't have to worry. You do!\" she said I turned my head and saw Harriet, Charlotte and Jamie heading towards us. \"Where were you all day?\" Harriet asked me \"Let me think... None of your business!\" I retorted \"I will definitely be notifying the headmistress about this!\" she said \"Harriet, what have I done wrong?\" I asked \"Well...you...\" she stuttered \"Exactly. So you can't get me in trouble.\" I said smartly And with that Harriet stormed off, followed by her shadows. Once they were out of ear shot, we all burst into laughter. Freddie looked our way and I shot him a look that said \"tell you later\". As soon as we finished dinner, I went with the girl to our room. Once we got upstairs and entered, my phone went off. It was Freddie. Meet me in the garden trouble! Freddie X I smiled at the message and was met by a chorus of wolf whistles and Drippy saying \"Lover boy wants you\". I quickly changed and went to the garden where we always went. \"Hello Trouble,\" he greeted me \"Freddie Kingsly,\" I said in my best English accent \"So what did Harriet want?\" he asked as he grabbed my hand and pulled me towards him. \"To know where I was today,\" I replied as I put my arms around his waist. \"And?\" \"And what?\" \"What did you tell her?\" he asked as he kissed my cheek. \"That it was none of her business where I was\" I said with a smile \"Ah... that explains it.\" Freddie smirked \"Explains what?\" \"Why she wasn't in my face like I was expecting\" \"She was trying to get me in trouble so I gave her nothing. It stumped her.\" \"You really are trouble.\" he laughed as he kissed me. I deepened the kiss, putting my arms around his neck and pulling him closer to me. Then I heard something I really Didn't want to. \"WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING!\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 A/N: OK so I am beyond sorry. I have neglected this story and I feel terrible. I have neglected all my stories but I plan on TRYING to write them again. Hopefully that will happen. So I thought I would start on this one since I watched I AM NUMBER 4 and it reminded me of this. So again I am so sorry and I will try to make this a long chapter. PPOV I pulled away from Freddie to come face to face with Harriet. This couldn't get any worse. I couldn't think of anything else except for the fact Freddie might get in trouble. \"Excuse me! I asked a question! WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?\" Harriet repeated. Thank god Freddie still had his cool, because I was just standing there like a sculpture. \"Not that it is any of your business, but I was kissing my girlfriend\" Freddie replied. I was so shocked. He actually called me his girlfriend. I forgot all about Harriet and turned to him. \"Really? I'm your girlfriend now?\" \"Of course you are trouble\" He replied, kissing my cheek. \"You are in so much trouble Poppy Moore! I am definitely telling the headmistress about this!\" Harriet screamed. I couldn't say anything. Freddie would get banned and then I would never see him again. \"You do that Harriet.\" Freddie said. Was he insane? Did he not want to see me ever again? Harriet smiled and turned around. \"I think I will\" She said as she walked off. I went to run after her but Freddie grabbed my arm. I turned to him shocked. \"Freddie! She is going to tell your mother about us! If she does, you will never be allowed back here and I will never see you again! Is that what you want?\" I said panicked. \"Silly girl. The only reason I am letting her is because my mother already knows about us. She asked me at dinner, before I sent the text to ask you to meet me here, if I liked you. Our little exchange before I sat down didn't get past her. She knew something was up between us. So she just asked me out right and I said I did. She told me to make it more official. To ask you out properly. And I was going to. Before Harriet walked in on us. So mother already knows about us. She is always the first to know anything. This is why I have such a close relationship with her. Because she is always the first to know.\" He replied calmly. \"So your mother allows this?\" I asked. I wanted to make sure, before I did anything else. \"Of course Trouble. If she didn't I would have been just as worried as you\" He replied as he kissed me. I sighed in relief into the kiss. I could relax. Freddie's mother knew about us. She allowed it. And she wouldn't kick him off the school grounds for this. But the main reason I could relax, Freddie was mine. He asked me, OK maybe not asked, more like announced, that we were going out. That I had a hold on him. That he loved me. That was all that mattered. Freddie Kingsly loved me. He had chosen me. And I would love him forever for that. FPOV Poppy pulled away from me. I already knew who it was and I was hoping Poppy wouldn't care. It was only Harriet. Although I didn't get around to tell her that we had my mother's blessing, so I could understand why she would care. She probably thought that I would get kicked off the school grounds and not allowed to return. That this would be the end of us. \"Excuse me! I asked a question! WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING?\" Harriet repeated. Poppy looked scared stiff so I answered calmly. \"Not that it is any of your business, but I was kissing my girlfriend\" I blurted out. I should have asked Poppy first but Harriet really made me mad. Poppy looked so shocked. I swear she forgot all about Harriet, because she turned to me and asked \"Really? I'm your girlfriend now?\" \"Of course you are trouble\" I replied, kissing her cheek. I would of kissed her, but Harriet was still there. \"You are in so much trouble Poppy Moore! I am definitely telling the headmistress about this!\" Harriet screamed. I could see Poppy freaking out even more. I didn't tell her the way I wanted to. I wanted her to not worry. \"You do that Harriet.\" I said. I knew we were safe. Harriet smiled and turned around. \"I think I will\" She said as she walked off. Poppy went to run after her but I grabbed her arm. I just wanted to be with her alone. For as long as we could. She turned to me shocked. \"Freddie! She is going to tell your mother about us! If she does, you will never be allowed back here and I will never see you again! Is that what you want?\" She said panicked. \"Silly girl. The only reason I am letting her is because my mother already knows about us. She asked me at dinner, before I sent the text to ask you to meet me here, if I liked you.

This is why I have such a close relationship with her. Because she is always the first to know.\" I replied calmly. \"So your mother allows this?\" She asked. She was so cute when she was worried. It made me just want to kiss her. \"Of course Trouble. If she didn't I would have been just as worried as you\" I said as I kissed he. She sighed in relief into the kiss. I knew she was relaxed now. So was I. My mother knew about us, which meant no more hiding. I could walk around with Poppy and not worry. But most importantly, Poppy was mine. She said yes. She didn't run off. I know I didn't ask her right, and I would fix that. I loved her and she needed to know that. I pulled back from the kiss and she pouted. I laughed at her face. It was so cute. \"Trouble, I want to do this properly.\" I said. She looked confused. So I continued. \"I had this whole plan, but Harriet ruined it. Now I know you have already agreed, but I still want to do this right. Poppy Moore, I love you so so much. Will you be my girlfriend?\" I was glad I could do that properly. But she looked sad. \"Trouble? Are you OK?\" She didn't reply. I closed my eyes, worried I went to far. Then she crashed into me, hugging me so tight. \"Freddie, that was so sweet,\" She said as she kissed me. I was over the moon. I pulled back. \"I love you Poppy Moore\" \" I love you too Freddie Kingsly. More than you know\" She said as she kissed me again. I was in heaven. I finally felt complete. I had Poppy. She loved me. I knew I could do anything now. So there you go. I hope that was good enough for all those who are loyal and have been waiting so long for an update. I will TRY to update again soon. I promise.

' General Lee, I have no division.'\" \"… there ought to be a heaven for young soldiers, especially young soldiers…\" -Michael Shaara, The Killer Angels The scent of war: ever-permeating, the smell of horses and gunpowder and the sweat of many men trapping in uniforms under the day's long sun. A constant smell that burned into one's nostrils, a smell that he had learned to love and to hate. Today had a new aroma to add to the mix- excitement, electric in the air. The knowledge that something large and great and historical was about to happen, sitting on the edge of the most pivotal moment in the history of the long war. Hearts, young and old, swelled with love and admiration- for the Generals, eccentric and lovable Pickett, God-like Lee, and love for the Cause. Yes, the Cause. For every man, the Cause was different. The right to own slaves, the right to choose whether or not to own slaves, or simply rights as a whole. For Reed Johnson, and many of his fellow soldiers, the Cause was to return home to his sweetheart after serving his country as honor required. The secession had happened, and is had been done, and it was now time to serve his beloved North Carolina and his waiting lady at home. His mind slipped back into a time past; lovely Anne on the porch step, hair escaping into brown wisps, fingers of a chill wind brushing her blue dress- her best dress. Their goodbyes had been said, he had just began to move away from the small house with a promise fresh off his lips. Anne kissed her hand and held it out to him, and for a moment, he almost turned back to her- forget the war, forget the North, let us be married now and sit back and watch as the North and South collide around us. The shoulder of another man brushed against his own, bringing back the scent of war. Anne's blue dress and her tear-streaked face dissipated into memory once more. Armistead's call went up- for your sweethearts, for your wives, for Virginia, For Anne and for North Carolina Forward! The line shifted; Pickett's soldiers moved ahead, up the slight incline of the hill. Some of the younger men spoke and were hushed by the older soldiers. Reed could sense the apprehension of the more wizened soldiers, the suggestion that they were not certain about this attack. But youth and pride overwhelmed the concerns of the grizzled old men. He caught a glimpse of Garnett; the injured commander could not miss this battle, even if it meant that he would have to traverse the field on horseback. The dark horse's nostrils flared, ears laid back at the thud of a cannon. For a moment, Reed was reminded of his older brother- a cavalry man with a spunky cinnamon colored horse. He swore up and down that the mare had Arabian blood in her; Reed consistently did not believe him. He had meant to speak to his brother before the charge, but had become too caught up in pre-battle chatter with the rest of Armistead's men. Stuart's cavalry, including Reed's brother, would be watching now, with no place in a battle such as this. Alexander's gunners saluted them as they passed. It was always a comfort to have the aid of Alexander's cannon. Alexander, just two years his senior, was an excellent gunner. \"Johnson,\" A voice spoke from behind him, slightly to the left. Reed knew that voice all too well; it was a voice always with a touch of test, a teller of amusing stories. He inclined his head to meet a set of grinning blue eyes. \"Bill.\" William Isaacs' grin grew ever wider. \"It appeared as though you weren't paying very much attention. Spending time with Anne?\" Isaacs was a Virginia boy, but he had become Reed's steadfast friend from the day they came under the command of Lo Armistead. \"If only,\" Johnson replied. \"I hear you, brother,\" Bill said. He glanced forward to the backs of Garnett and Kemper's brigades. They were cresting the hill now. For a moment, Reed thought he saw a rare glint of fear in Isaacs' pale eyes. \"Fight hard for your girl, Reed,\" He said solemnly. \"That is the best strength you can have.\" Bill fell into silence, and Reed could think of no statement to add to it. Cannon fire began now, but not from Alexander's guns. The entire brigade tensed as a cannonball met earth and bodies to their left; several of Trimble's men disappeared in a cloud of dirt and smoke. \"Here is comes,\" an old soldier beside Reed hissed. The commanders continued to spur their men on, even as cannon fire met their lines. More bursts of smoke showed in the brigades ahead. Reed found himself marching of the twisted bodies of Garnett's men. And then the cannonballs met Armistead's brigade. A chunk of the brigade's extreme right disappeared; limbs torn from torsos flew into the air. The ground several yards ahead of Reed exploded; he blinked past the dust and acrid smoke. Garnett and Kemper's men were slowing, swelling back, met by the wooden fence that stretched across the field. Had the mile march already moved so quickly? He could spot the Union soldiers clearly now; bluecoats lined up behind a wall of wood and stone. The men above pushed against the fence, clamoring over it now, and the real slaughter began. Reed barely saw a man move post the fence; most fell against it or only a few feet from it. Canister fire sent sprays of shrapnel in all directions, tearing flesh, blinding eyes, tugging at guts. The firm shield of Garnett and Kemper's brigades had collapsed, like an ocean wave against firm rocks, into a mountain of bodies. Armistead's men met the broken remains of the fence and the brigades. Reed's fingers slipped on the blood-soaked wood of the fence as he climbed over. An explosion suddenly went off behind him; he was propelled towards the ground of bodies. He groped for his rifle, propped himself up on one hand, looked over his shoulder to see the gaping hole where Bill had once been. The hole quickly filled over shrapnel-encrusted bodies. \"Come on, men!\" Armistead howled. Reed found his footing at last and fell back into the remaining men. Garnett and Kemper and collapsed into writhing, wounded bodies and stiffening corpses- it was up to Armistead to take the lead. Fear was enveloped in the roar of the charge. Armistead's men ran up the hill; Reed could sense the bluecoats faltering and moving with uncertainty. Armistead's brigade had risen up like a great snarling beast, a stinging grey monster with a hide of silver thorns. The charge was all-consuming; for Virginia, for North Carolina, for the damn cinnamon mare and Anne's blue dress dancing across the farthest corners of his vision- It felt like a bee sting. Just a bee sting- only a pinch of pain, a minor inconvenience. His conscious mind ordered him to ignore it, but involuntary action demanded otherwise. He placed a hand against his stomach, fingers scraping the rough cotton material of his uniform. It felt strangely warm. His mind was screaming- ignore it, put it aside for later! But his hand returned. For a moment, he thought his eyes were lying to him; his fingers were coated in crimson. Reed felt the full force of the shot, realization and pain spreading across his body. The ground fell out from underneath him and he was moving in an open space, before his knees met the earth. He looked down- a single hole was punched in his uniform, ringing in an expanding stain of red. No It was agonizingly difficult to raise his head again and watch as his brigade met the Union wall. Armistead shouted to his men with sword raised- his voice was no longer clear. The glint of the bayonets was dulled, the field layered with stricken Southern bodies blended into a mass of twisting maggots. The whole world was rotting around him, the reek of death and blood and decay choking the air. He was going to suffocate in the rot, into the dead… A flash of blue cut across his sight. That cinnamon mare, eyes wild and snout flaring, ran across the sea of fly spawn. Its hoof steps made the filth dissipate, repulsing the darkness. Maybe it was an Arabian- the eyes were so wild… Anne. She followed in the horse's wake, dark hair worn free. Suddenly nothing mattered- not the Confederacy, not the Union, only his Cause was important. Only his Anne. Reed Johnson fell into the warm blue darkness of hope and memory. Author's Note From July 1st, 1863, to July 3rd, 1863, Robert E. Lee's forces struggled against the Union army at Gettysburg. It was intended be Lee's first offensive victory of his career. Pickett's charge became the bloodiest moment of the battle. While most of North Carolina's casualties did not occur in Pickett's Charge, North Carolina's losses were some of the highest overall.

He thought perhaps it had been a momentary whimsical notion so at odds for a man many thought dour. Yet it played on his mind to the point he could see it happening in some idealistic manner that had no function in that place and time. Dreams had no place in war. The notion of how to do it kept on popping up, the point where he thought… why not. It is likely I will be dead in a day or two, why not have a dream come true just once more before I die. He sent for an aide and while he waited he sat beneath a tree in the shade and wrote the letter. When the aide cantered up he handed up the letter and gave his orders. \"Take this letter under flag of truce to the Union lines. Deliver it to General Winfield Hancock. Tell him that General Lewis Armistead wishes to meet with him.\" The Union lines, late morning It was a hot day, as hot as any July day Win Hancock could recall. He itched inside his clothes, stank of perspiration and wondered when he would ever get the chance to be clean again. He'd stripped down to his underwear and washed himself that morning in his tent and it had felt good. For all of an hour, until he'd clothed himself once more in shirt, vest and coat, until the sun had risen to cook him like a potato in its jacket. Still, he was better off than most of his men, forced to stand or sit out in the sun unprotected, swatting at flies and scratching at fleas, a rank, dirty, swearing mass of misery. In other words, a typical army. \"Sir, can I get you anything, you had no breakfast. I have some coffee fresh made, and the butter and bread are still good.\" Win squinted up at his aide, an easy going young lieutenant from Wisconsin. \"I'll say yes to the bread and butter, John, but I'd surrender to Lee for a cold glass of something.\" He sighed. \"Lemonade, fresh squeezed, ice clinking in the glass.\" The young man groaned. \"Lord sir, me too. Now I shall be thinking of nought else all day.\" The lieutenant took off his glasses and wiped them on a grimy kerchief. \"In place of that, I can offer water, milk that is only slightly sour, or coffee.\" \"Coffee then, thank you John.\" He was breaking his fast and downing the last of the coffee when a rider approached, swinging down out of the saddle to salute his aide. They spoke for a few moments and John approached, looking puzzled. \"Sir, a very odd thing. There is a rebel courier at the wall with a note for you.\" Something suddenly buzzed in Win's stomach, unsettling his breakfast. \"From?\" \"A reb General, someone called General Ermastid?\" \"Armistead!\" He leapt to his feet, grabbing his boots that he'd kicked off to better enjoy his breakfast. \"Lord God and all his angels! Yes, yes, bring the courier up to me.\" The confederate officer walked up the slope, the makeshift white flag still tied to the end of his sabre, looking totally unconcerned at the suspicious glances of the blue coated troops around him. He stopped in front of Win and saluted briskly. \"Sir, if you are General Hancock, I bear a message from my division Commander, General Armistead.\" Win returned the salute and held out his hand. \"I am Hancock, give it to me.\" He tore the letter open, hand shaking a little, and ran his eyes over the few neatly written lines. \"You may tell the General that I agree. My aide shall be at the place you entered our lines in one hour.\" The rebel officer saluted again. \"Very well sir.\" Win watched the officer being escorted back down the hill, hardly even aware of doing so, eyes unfocused as he tried to stop himself from showing an improper glee. Calmly, he turned to his aide. \"John, make yourself available as I have just said in an hour.\" John blinked, puzzled. \"For what, sir?\" \"To greet my guest. General Armistead is coming to pay me a visit.\" It was a long ride across the grassy slope towards the hill, taken at a slow pace, accompanied by aides bearing white flags, to give the enemy plenty of time to see them. Such things were not done in haste, even though Lew wanted to grind his spurs into horse and gallop full pelt up the hill. The only good thing was the anticipation. Like a child expecting a treat, he allowed himself to enjoy the slow ride for what it would give him at its end. Lew had taken particular care of his appearance. He was wearing his best uniform, the gold sash with its flamboyant tassles around his waist beneath is sword belt, boots shined to an unusual gloss, hair and beard trimmed, uniform brushed. Somehow it felt proper to look his best, for this one special time. Oddly, he felt no fear. Even under a flag of truce it was dangerous to ride openly towards the enemy lines. Many fingers were on many triggers, and one angry or tired or unhappy man could tighten that finger and blow his life away. Yet somehow he knew that would not happen. The day that had started stinking hot was suddenly sweet and fresh, the sun kind, the air rich with promise. He was riding to meet his oldest friend, to touch his hand and see his face, and surely God in his Heaven could not deny him that small bliss. Finally they topped the rise and stopped before the low stone wall that ran the full length of the hill. His soldier's eye noted the Union strength there, the masses of men moving around, camped in regiments, behind the massed dark iron of the artillery. God help us, he thought, if we are to attack this line. With Hancock holding the centre, there will be no weakness here. Their very best commands the army's backbone. He waited as a young officer approached to salute. \"General Armistead, I am General Hancock's aide. Would you come with me, please?\" He nodded, resisting a childish urge to say \"Well, that is why am here!\" He swung down from the saddle and handed the reins to his aide, maintaining a stately demeanour. \"Stay here, George. No, I will be fine. Wait for me.\" He followed the lieutenant, looking straight ahead, aware of the curious observation of the blue-coated troops. Parleys between the armies were rare, rarer still were meetings between ranking officers where a surrender was not involved. Surrounded by Third Corp, Lew could almost imagine himself back in California when he too had worn a blue coat, serving together with Win and Pete Longstreet and George Pickett. The aide led him up a rough path, past a series of what looked to be headquarters tents and onto a small farmhouse situated near a grove of trees. The lieutenant stopped at the doorway, opened it and stood aside for Lew to enter. He blinked in the dimmer light and then heard an achingly familiar voice speak. \"Thank you John, that will be all.\" \"But sir…\" \"Trust me John, I am perfectly safe with the General.\" The door closed behind him and Lew looked across the room and into the face of the man he cared for most in the world. He hadn't changed at all. Still the trim, tall figure, the handsome face framed by its neat short beard and moustache, the bright intelligent eyes. Right now those eyes were shining and that face was split by a broad, toothy grin. Hardly aware of what he was doing, Lew crossed the room in a wide stride and threw his arms around Hancock. He felt Win's arms circle him, hugging him as strongly as he held Win. His senses were full of the man, of his warm perspiration, the faint smell of his cologne, the feel of woollen cloth on his face, of hair brushing his. \"Not sure…\" he said, voice rough, \"..what Old Pete would think, me holding a Federal general like this. Most unseemly.\" Win's body vibrated with sudden laughter. \"I think my people would faint fair away if they saw me.\" After a few wonderful moments they parted and Lew noted that Win's eyes were damp, just as his were. \"Lord Win, it's good to see you. I never thought I would again.\" Win dragged out a chair for him and he sat, as Hancock took the other to sit next to him. They studied each other, soaking in the image as if they could imprint it on their minds and memories. \"I was delighted to get your letter. I never thought General Lee would let you do this, never even imagined it.\" Lew laughed, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand. \"General Lee doesn't know, not sure what he'd think of it, to be truthful. Pete let me come.\" Win nodded, eyes never leaving Lew's face. \"Good old Pete. I heard about his children, please tell him how sorry I am for his loss. But what of everyone else? How goes George Pickett, still as mad as ever?\" They shared stories over the afternoon, telling of friends gone and friends alive, family and home. The war seemed very far away as the afternoon drifted towards evening, and only the sound of the evening taps brought them back to earth. Finally, unwillingly, Lew finally stood. \"I have to go, been here too long by rights. We both have duties to see to that won't wait.\" Win nodded, and held out his hand. \"Lew, take care of yourself. I want to see you after this is over.\" Grasping it for one last touch, Lew smiled. \"I shall do my best to obey your orders, sir. And I shall be very angry if you do not do the same. You have a bad habit of putting yourself forward.\" \"You should talk, you old war horse!\" Win went to the door and opened it, to stand sillouetted by the warm evening light. \"I prey to God that this will be over soon. I am so tired of seeing my friends die.\" Lew stood beside him, tugging on his gloves and looking across the grassy hill. \"Too many friends, too many sad letters to write.\" He turned, straightened and made a brisk salute. \"General.\" Win returned the salute, smile fading but eyes still brightly watching. \"General.\" There was no more they could say and no more they could do before the watching eyes of the army. Lew mounted, gave a small half wave, half salute, and turned his horse's head back towards his men. Win Hancock watched him go until the tall mounted figure was lost in the fading day's shadows. ====================================================================== This meeting never took place, although it should have. Hancock and Armistead were indeed extremely close friends and they faced each other in battle at Gettysburg. Sadly Lew was shot during that epic, dreadful charge and died of his wounds in a Union hospital without, as far as we know, ever seeing his dear friend again. Hancock was also wounded but survived and went on to become a politician and almost ran for President. Hancock was a superb officer, liked by his men and respected by his peers. He did indeed hold the centre together when the Army of Northern Virginia threw itself at the Union forces at Gettysburg. But I like to think that if there had been a moment for them, it might have been like that.

The night air was cool, but he had to reach up and wipe away the beads of sweat on his forehead. Running a hand through his hair, he stared at the plain wall of his tent and let out a shaky breath. Most nights he was able to go to sleep without lingering on thoughts of all the things he had seen. Not tonight. Every time he closed his eyes, it was all before him again. He could hear the explosions, shouts, and screams. He could see men that he had known being killed in front of him. He could taste the smoke. He could see the countless dead lying on the ground, their blood staining the soil. Antietam. The name echoed in his mind like a death toll. So many men had died. Thousands of fathers, sons, and brothers, all fighting for their freedom and their homes, would never see those homes again. He couldn't forget it, couldn't get it out of his mind. And he couldn't sleep. With another sigh, Sandie stood up. Crossing his arms against the cool breeze, he ducked out of his tent and began walking. Passing row after row of tents, he kept going until he was just outside the camp. He looked up at the stars, taking slow, deep breaths. Trying to think of anything besides the war around him, he let his mind wander. The stars brought it back to Virginia. Back home he and his family had loved to sit outside on warm evenings, watch the stars come out, and sing together. Sandie frowned. He could hardly remember the last time he'd had the opportunity to sing. Shifting his position slightly, he looked down at the ground. The words of one of his father's favorite hymns suddenly came to his mind. Acting on an unexplainable urge, Sandie quietly began to sing. A mighty fortress is our God, A bulwark never failing. Drawing in a shaky breath, he closed his eyes, focusing on the words that he sang. Our helper He amidst the flood Of mortal ills prevailing. With every line, his voice grew stronger and louder. Drawing power and encouragement from the words, he continued, forgetting all his surroundings. For still our ancient foe Doth seek to work us woe- His craft and power are great, And, armed with cruel hate, On earth is not his equal. Sandie ended and stood quietly, thinking about the song. He looked up at the sky again with a small smile on his face. Then footsteps crunched on the ground behind him. Surprised, he spun around. \"General Jackson!\" Sandie swallowed, trying to think of something to say. \"Sir, I'm -- uh, I'm sorry. If I disturbed you--\" The general quickly put up his hand and waved away Sandie's explanation. \"Mr. Pendleton, do not concern yourself with me. The singing of such a wonderful hymn could never disturb me, especially when it is so well sung. You may have woke me,\" he added with a wide smile, \"but you did not disturb me.\" Sandie tried to smile past his embarrassment. Unsure of what to say, he looked down. General Jackson, however, didn't seem to be waiting for an explanation. He stood by Sandie's side and looked up at the heavens, a calm smile on his face. For a few moments they stood in silence. \"Do you know the second verse to that hymn you were singing, Mr. Pendleton?\" the general asked suddenly. Sandie shook his head. \"A little, sir, but not well enough to sing, I'm afraid.\" General Jackson nodded. \"The second verse is one of my favorites.\" He cleared his throat. Softly, he began to speak again, his voice rhythmic but entirely sincere as he recited. \" 'Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing, were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God's own choosing. Doth ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is He – Lord Sabaoth His name, from age to age the same, and He must win the battle! '\" Bowing his head, Sandie nodded without speaking, trying to hide his sudden emotion. The powerful words, spoken so confidently by his general, brought a lump to his throat that he couldn't speak past. General Jackson looked over at him and nodded understandingly. \"Sandie,\" he said gently, \"there are nights for every soldier when he cannot sleep. There are times that everything threatens to overwhelm us. This is when we must turn to God; He is the only One Who can give us peace and also strength. He is Lord Sabaoth, the 'Lord of hosts.' He is our Commander, and He will always give us victory!\" Sandie looked into his general's eyes and nodded. He'd known Thomas Jackson for quite some time, and as long as he'd known him he'd respected him, especially for his unwavering faith. \"Come with me, Mr. Pendleton,\" General Jackson said with a smile, clapping his hand on Sandie's shoulder. \"You see, I've had an idea.\" No answer was given to Sandie's questioning look. The two men walked back toward the camp together, and the general insisted that they go into his tent. Once inside, Jackson rummaged through some of his things until he pulled out a worn blue book. Looking closer, Sandie realized that it was a hymnbook. \"You see, Mr. Pendleton, I was planning on reading through the songs in this hymnbook over time. There is so much truth and comfort to be found in hymns. Tonight I began to think that you might help me with this, sir.\" \"How can I help, General?\" \"I am not a singer,\" the general admitted with a chuckle, \"but I should like to sing through these songs, rather than just reading them. Since you have demonstrated tonight what a fine singer you are, perhaps you would help me. I was wondering if you would like to work your way through this hymnal with me, Mr. Pendleton.\" Sandie smiled. \"Of course you will have to bear with my mistakes,\" General Jackson added. \"Sir, I would be honored to sing through a hymnal with you,\" Sandie answered. \"Thank you, General.\" ","Summary":" Sandie Pendleton sighed and sat up on his small cot.

John thought excitedly. Meyer had just graduated from High School two months earlier and he had a pretty easy, average life. Now, the history buff had finally arrived at the location he dreamt and read about since he was five as he unloaded the bin containing his Wedge tent from the back of his 2006 Chevrolet Tahoe. \"Hey, John!\" Reilly Smith cried out, rushing up to greet him. \"Reilly! You good for nothing damn black hat!\" Meyer laughed heartily. \"You know where the rest of the unit is at?\" \"I'll show you the way, John. We can't keep the others waiting.\" John is a member of a reenacting unit called D Company, 19th Indiana Volunteers which is based upon the original Company D who fought in the famed Iron Brigade during the American Civil War. John looked around and saw rows of tentage with some reenactors already in uniform while others were just like him: dressed in a T-shirt and shorts. The weather was currently a lovely ninety degrees with high humidity. Still, more were just arriving at the already packed parking lot and began to unload their equipment. The buddies walked for a few more yards until they reached the designated campsite for their unit. Frank, Joe, and Robert were already waiting for them. \"Well well. Look who we have here.\" Franklin Tucker grinned as he notices the new arrivals. \"Is that John?\" Joseph Smith questioned. \"Yep. It's good old me alright.\" Meyer declared as he sat down the bin holding his tent. \"Where would you like me to set up?\" \"There's plenty of room next to mine.\" \"Thanks, Joe.\" Meyer began unpacking the A-Frame, rope, and iron stakes along with the three wooden posts he connected to keep the canvas from falling down. \"Need any assistance?\" Robert O'Neill asked. \"Nah. I'm good.\" Unbeknownst to John, in less than six hours, the man will be heading to war. And they say that Gettysburg was haunted...

McPherson Ridge, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania July 1st, 1863-8:30 AM Local Time Eighteen years old Abigail Foxley-known as 'Andy Smith' to her comrades- loaded her carbine once again as the Confederate infantry slowly advanced on the road known as the 'Chambersburg Pike'. The Sixth Pennsylvania Calvary were holding the line against the graybacks who have yet again decided to come up North of the Mason-Dixon line. By holding the high ground overlooking the road and utilizing breechloaders, the Union cavalry was managing to hold their positions against the Johnnies, but Abby knows by now that it's only a matter of time until the Rebs take the ridge with their superior numbers and the Federals need reinforcements soon. Aiming her Model 1859 Sharps, Foxley sees a grayback Sergeant urging his men forward and the blonde open fired, the .52 Caliber round hitting his leg a few moments later. The man she shot was picked up by two Privates and carried off from the field to the rear. Abby had grown up in a well-respected gentry family over three thousand miles away just outside of Bristol, England listening to her grandfather's tale of his time in India as well as hearing about the Charge of the Light Brigade during the War in the Crimea. She became fascinated with the idea of war and dreamt of partaking in a glorious campaign against Her Majesty's enemies, but she knew that it would never be possible as it was expected of her to become a mother after being married off to another gentry family or perhaps the nobility. Her own mother, a Scot by heritage, died during childbirth in 1858 and her father never got over the deaths. That was when things began to go downhill after her father remarried. Her stepmother-Jane Farrell- distasted the fact that her stepdaughter was part Scottish and didn't hide it. The final straw was in the Spring of 1861 when her family took a vacation across the Atlantic to Philadelphia. Unbeknownst to her at the time, she was going to meet her future husband, who was looking after his investments. That man was also her step-uncle and after being touched inappropriately against her will, Abby ran off. Ever since then, Abby wondered what would have occurred if she remained behind instead of running off. This wasn't her fight nor her land but yet she enlisted as a means to escape her situation and to perhaps live a better life. Shaking her head out of her thoughts, Abby reloaded her breechloader, took careful aim and open fire on another Reb as the endless rows of graybacks marched towards the ridge.

He also had on his accouterments and in his hand is a .58 Caliber 1861 Springfield rifle-musket. The Hoosier native was satisfied that everything was in order and he was ready for the next day. 'Well, I guess the ten thousand dollars in equipment was worth it in the end.' Meyer smiled but his eyes widened at a most curious sight. In front of him was a glowing figure in the uniform of a Confederate Brigadier General nodding his disapproval at the reenactor. \"After one hundred and fifty years, the North and the South are still fighting each other. And I thought Yankees were unsophisticated factory workers with no culture. But I am wrong. I once had hope in General Lee, but I lost it after my life was forfeited when I made the charge with Pickett.\" John was stunned and he recognized the spirit instantly from a few history books. Before him was the ghost of Lewis Addison Armistead! \"W..What do...you want.\" The Hoosier stammered. John wasn't sure if his weapon would do anything against a specter, but Meyer raised the Springfield to the ready position and pulled the hammer back to half cock. \"I want you Jonathan Meyer to see what the war was actually like. I am ashamed that society today is looking at the conflict as a political tool, forgetting that over six hundred thousand Americans lost their lives. I need you to experience the conflict and eat, sleep and fight alongside the men who participated in the Second American Revolution John. You are going back in time.\" All of a sudden, a lightning bolt struck the reenactor before he could protest and John's vision went to black.

Reynolds walked down the line checking on his men as they marched to reinforce Buford and his cavalry. He was about to head back to the head of the column when Reynolds saw that one of his men was asleep in a nearby ditch. Understanding that his men were tired from the marching, the man got off from his horse, gave the reins to an orderly, and walked over to him. \"Time to get up Private.\" [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[ Jonathan Meyer Gettysburg, Pennsylvania July 1st, 1863-9:00 AM Local Time Army of the Potomac's I Corps, 1st Division, 1st 'Iron' Brigade, 19th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment John heard a voice and groaned...Wiping his eyes, the Hoosier looked at his surroundings in shock. It was morning and not near the outhouses at all. And there was a General before him. 'I must have a massive hangover last night drinking Bourbon with Reilly again...I don't remember anything about last night except for setting up my tent and changing.' \"Are you okay son? Do you need any water?\" \"I'm okay sir. Just tired is all.\" The unknown General smiled at Meyer and granted him a pat on the back. \"I understand son. We got a big battle ahead and now please fall back into the column.\" John got up from the ditch and held his rifle in the 'shoulder arms' position, as soon as he got up, the unknown reenactor asked him something. \"What unit are you apart of Private?\" \"The Nineteenth sir.\" \"Ah, the Indiana regiment under Williams... Your unit is just behind the 2nd Wisconsin.\" \"Umm...Thanks sir.\" Meyer knows that the current leader of the 19th Indiana reenactors is not under a 'Williams' but Captain Timothy Clark. Shrugging it off as the General's attempt to stay in character, John rejoined the ranks and marched forward to the field to reenact the first day at Gettysburg.

It was such a shame to see the process repeat itself again. For centuries, humanity had been in constant conflict with itself, but God knows that it was an unfortunate course for men to compete for resources and the creator of the universe never wanted the world that he called 'Earth' to be in such a state. Ever since Adam and Eve screwed things up in the Garden of Eden after being tempted by that snake, the world went from paradise to occasionally chaotic. \"I hope you realize Jonathan that this engagement is more than just about wearing a uniform and utilizing a gun on weekends and eating non-period pizza at night.\" God will attempt to protect Meyer as much as possible, but he isn't going to interfere in the American Civil War unless he wants to change history forever. \"And you better not cause history to take an alternate course Meyer.\" God mumbled.[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[ Jonathan Meyer Gettysburg, Pennsylvania July 1st, 1863-10:00 AM Local Time Army of the Potomac's I Corps, 1st Division, 1st 'Iron' Brigade, 19th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment 'This is it.' John thought as he continued marching alongside his fellow reenactors to portray the Iron Brigade's arrival to relieve Buford and his cavalry. \"By the right flank, company into the line!\" The Colonel ordered. John and his comrades instantly obeyed the command and changed from a marching formation to form a battleline against the opposition and Meyer smiled. This is going to be a day long remembered days to come as the biggest gathering of reenactors portraying the Iron Brigade of the West. \"Forward! For God sake, forward!\" The unknown general barked. Meyer witness the man's waving his sword, urging his men to press the attack, before a single shot rang out...He slumped forward and fell off his horse. An orderly came to check on him, but John was still shocked at what he just witnessed. 'What the Fuck! Who brought live ammunition to the event!' Men right and left and in front of him began to drop like flies and the lines of the graybacks received the same treatment of lead. \"Thar ain't no milissy, it's the damn black hats!\" A rebel who yelled those famous words declared from their lines. 'Oh, God...I remember now.' John shouted in his head as the event of the previous night came back to him in a flash. 'SHIT!' The reenactor now realizes that he is in this mess all thanks to a Confederate ghost and that he has traveled back to Gettysburg circa 1863. Another one of the men next to him went down and the reenactor knows that blanks are not going to be effective against actual rounds, so the 21st Century man quickly knelt down and began to open the corpse cartridge box when a voice stopped him in his tracks. \"What are you doing Private!?\" A Sergeant asked John. \"My rounds don't have any lead Sarge...Just powder.\" Shaking his head in disbelief, the Sergeant handed John a few rounds out of his cartridge box. \"After this, I want to personally inspect your cartridges...Is that understood?\" \"Yes Sergeant.\" \"Powder only my ass.\" The NCO muttered as he fired his Springfield once more.

McPherson Ridge, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania July 1st, 1863-11:00 AM Local Time \"Here comes our reinforcements men!\" Abby watches as the Black Hat Brigade of the Army of the Potomac marched forward to meet the graybacks head on and potentially drive them back away from the town. It has been a long morning for the cavalry soldiers defending McPherson Ridge and the eighteen year old believe that her comrades deserve some credit from the infantry for managing to hold the line against the Confederates this day. It wasn't unknown that the infantry and artillerymen despised the Cavalry for not engaging in action enough, mocking their mounted comrades with the sneer 'Whoever saw a dead cavalryman?' \"Prepare to mount!\" Foxley was handed the reins back from the Corporal who was designated as the fourth man and held the reins of the horses while the other troopers fought. \"So did you behave yourself, Pepper?\" Foxley jokingly questioned her Narragansett Pacer, which is unusual in an Army of Morgans and Kentucky Saddlers, but the stallion was loyal despite his notorious antics of wanting to run off and explore every pasture. However, the bugles interrupted her as the retreat call was sounded and one by one the horses instinctively began to run away from the action. The trooper can still hear the rifle fire off in the distance as the two factions continue to take casualties and Abigail lamented at the thought of the loss of life, but the war has been in its third year already and it has no sign of stopping soon. The First Bull Run has put that dream to an end, but the President and the citizens of the United States are determined to \"Ready!... Aim!\" 'Great.' The woman thought as she heard cracks of musketry being fired at her and her comrades. She pulled out her personal .54 bore Beaumont–Adams revolver and pulled the hammer back before unleashing a .442 caliber ball. One of the Johnnies went down with a round in his shoulder and Abby proceeded to use the Double Action by pulling the trigger. The Rebels opened up again with another volley and Foxley attempted to get her stallion to run faster, but the Anglo-Scottish woman didn't realize that she was beginning to slip off her M1859 'McClellan' Saddle and her horse bucked back wildly in fear. Abby tried to hold on to the reins but couldn't and she fell off of the side. Her vision faded to black as Pepper ran off with some of the graybacks taking potshots at him. Unknownst to the Confederates standing next to her shooting at the fleeing animal, the trooper is only unconscious.[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[ Jonathan Meyer Gettysburg, Pennsylvania July 1st, 1863-11:25 AM Local Time Army of the Potomac's I Corps, 1st Division, 1st 'Iron' Brigade, 19th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment 'This is just great. Go to Gettysburg they say. It'll be fun they say...Time travel wasn't mentioned at all.' John sarcastically reflected as he aimed down the sights of his 1861 Springfield. The reenactor took careful aim and waited for the right moment to fire since the order was 'independent fire' aka fire at will and your own pace. The reenactor managed to hit his seventeenth Reb and even though he feels disgusted at the killing alongside the fact that he didn't sign up for this, it was actual combat and he needs to survive. 'It was either him or me.' He reminded himself sadly as yet another order was given. \"Company! Ceasefire!... About face! Forward march!\" 'So our asses can be targets...Lovely' John had a few close calls so far and he was glad that he was in the rear ranks...Now he wasn't so glad since his back is now exposed to enemy fire...At least statistically most soldiers of the period missed. But these were also rifles , not smoothbores, and add to the fact that John is taller than the average infantryman of the time, it's a potential death sentence. \"Halt!... Company about face!\" 'Praise the Lord.' \"Ready!\" John prepared his musket and made sure it was loaded with a .58 caliber Minne ball and a percussion cap. \"Aim!\" The reenactor chose a target and decided to pick off a grayback officer...He was leading his men to counter the current position of the Union lines, but this officer is going to have his life cut short. \"Fire!\" The entire company opened up in a simultaneous volley and the smoke generated blocked the view of the line. John watches as the smoke disapates and the officer he aimed at was bleeding out from a head wound. He'll be lucky if he survives the night. 'This is just how I wanted my first time visiting Gettysburg to be like. Haunting the past!' John is in for quite the ride and he knows it. 'Next thing I know is that I'll find myself a nice ticket to Andersonville...A truly wonderful place.' But speaking of rides, Meyer and the other Black Hats looked on at an unexpected arrival to the scene of the action. \"You got to be shitting me.\" The reenactor muttered as a riderless horse literally bolted out of a field and caused some confusion in the ranks. \"Language.\" One of the deeply religious men scolded John. It not that John wasn't religious, for which he is. It's just that the reenactor occasionally uses foul language. \"Well Parker, I guess the Lord Almighty sent us a horse of all things.\" \"Guess so.\" Even the Confederates were astonished at the sight and some of the opposition held their fire as this horse ran past behind the bluebellies position and created a distraction. \"Somebody take control of that horse!\" Shooting still continued regardless of the wild bronco and the order was ignored for now since the 19th Indiana needed to focus on the task at hand despite the entertainment. \"Meyer!\" The Sergeant John meet earlier shouted. \"I want you to see if you can control that damn animal!\" \"Me?\" The reenactor was shocked...More like stunned. John already was surprised that he have traveled back in time and now in the middle of a battle of all things, a Sergeant is ordering him to deal with a renegade. \"With respect, isn't better to have a cavalryman or an officer or someone who understands horses better than I do, Sarge?\" \"The officers are busy ordering us around and the cavalry is retreating Meyer...Do you want a court martial?\" John gulped since some sentences through Court Martials literally were firing squads. \"I'll get right on it.\" The reenactor fell out of the ranks and proceded to try to grab the animal's harness. Occasionally Jonathan ducked his head as he heard the distinct whistle of bullets zinging nearby and he slowly approached the horse as it ran in circles behind the Union ranks. 'At least its smart enough to stay out of the way.' The horse continued to prance around as if it was looking for something...or someone and John's gut clenched at the thought of its caretaker has been killed, which could explain why this animal is acting wildly. The fighting continued all around him and the unruly mammal continued to snort and neigh in anguish. The horse finally stopped running around, stood still near a large boulder, and lowered its head depressingly. John couldn't help but feel bad at the horse's current welfare. 'I guess it did lose its owner.' He judged as he slowly approached the silver-gray animal. The horse look up and saw Meyer walking towards him, snorting in response. \"Hey. I'm not going to hurt you...Nice horse. Be a good horse.\" The farmboy admittedly didn't know much about horses and the closest experience he haves is with a few cows back home, not to mention riding a horse at the fair when he was five or six alongside fighting alongside reenactors who portray cavalry. But other than those three exceptions, John is not knowledgeable in horses at all. The horse allowed John to touch it and grab its reins. Meyer turned and saw a sight he didn't want to see yet. The Iron Brigade is retreating! In fact, Meyer is going to be left behind and maybe be sent to Andersonville if he doesn't catch up. But the horse had other ideas and began to pull Meyer in a direction he didn't want to go. \"Surrender Billy!\" One of Tennesseans cried out. \"Enough you stupid animal!\" John is thinking that this idiotic mammal is going to get them both killed and Meyer doesn't desire to be taken prisoner to one of the southern POW camps, which had a notorious history of malnutrition and Andersonville was one of the worst next to Libby Prison. But this mustang was being stubborn as a mule and lead John to a direction it wants to go, no matter what John opinion on the matter was. \"I said surrender Billy!\"He ordered again as other southerners backed him up. John had thought about just giving up and take his chance at one of the era's POW camps and hope for the best when he spotted a 1858 Remington in the saddlebag. Meyer pulled it out and yelled at the deranged, yet patriotic fool. \"Screw you!\" The revolver fire a single .44 caliber ball and John hit the grayback in the neck, severing an artery and blood sprayed out of the mortal wound. 'Let's hope I remember correctly how to ride.' John pondered as he leaped onto the 'McClellan' Saddle. \"Ya!\" The Rebs began to fire at the fleeing man, attempting to avenge their brother in arms to no avail.

But God wished that the wild Narragansett Pacer would not have been at Willoughby Run near Herbst Woods as the 19th Indiana fought the 1st Tennessee. 'Oh Well. At least John is learning about history and experiencing it for himself.' Okay. I did a few changes. It seems like John is in for quite the ride and a fight for his life. Poor John. The Iron Brigade notoriously suffered from a high causality rate throughout the war and the 19th Indiana specifically lost one in four men at Gettysburg-either killed or wounded. Yep. And don't get me started on Small Pox:P Well, regardless, he is either the luckiest or unluckiest reenactor depending on one's point of view. And for your information regarding the Adams revolver, .54 bore is .442 caliber...The Brits during the 19th Century interestingly used the Bore (also known as Guage) designation for handguns in addition to shotguns. And it seems like something alternate history wise is happening...All thanks to a horse. P.S. Yes, I'm totally aware that I've brought God himself into the story and I am not going to change it. The men during the Civil War were highly religious, not to mention superstitious and John is a Christian. Besides, both the Simpsons and Family Guy depict God in a few of their episodes.

He didn't mindnthe cold. \"Lawrence, you sound just likenMama. You know that?\" The 25 year-old chuckled. \"I'mnyour brother, remember? I'm supposed to look after you.

Let's go!\" In his brother's opinion he had beennplayful as a child; impish, mischievous, a \"little rogue\". nBut at the age of 14, he'd learned to control that energy, to keep itnstored up for occasions like these. \"Don't go too far.\" Tom glared. \"Course not. I'm notndumb.\" \"I never said you were.\" \"I know, but it was implied innyour tone.\" Tom sat on a fallen tree and pouted. Lawrence sighed. How many times hadnthey had this conversation? He'd lost count. \"Thomas, Mothernwants me to discuss something with you.\" If his brother used his full name, itnwas serious. \"What, then?\" \"I... don't know how to say this,nbut... You're 14, now. You should understand why I say what I'mngonna say... There are certain... things a full-grown man needs tonknow.\" He mentally swore. Damn awkward conversation. But itnhad to be done. \"You need to grow out of your childish ways. nBe a man, if you will allow the expression.\" He felt vaguelynlike he was chastising his students. \"I don't mean to be harsh,nbut if you don't straighten up now, I fear you never will. I don'tnwant you to become the 'village idiot', in a sense. I want you tonbecome a fine young man. Father doesn't emphasize that enough, andnMother asked me to take over where he left off.\" He stopped asnhe saw Tom's face redden. \"Lawrence, I am grown up. I'm 14 , fornGod's sake. Can't I have a few more years to be young ?n I don't want to end up a boring old man, sittin' in my rockingnchair, readin' the newspaper.\" He smoked an imaginary pipe. \"Inwant an exiting life. How am I gonna get that when I haf ta be allnstuffy? I don't want to grow up.\" Rebellion. It wasnonly natural. Tom was an angel in church, in class... but if thenopportunity arose, he would rush out the front door in to thensurrounding forestry to carouse with friends. We almost lost himnlast night, but he found his way back. How to deal with thisnindependent individual? \"Tom, I'mngonna go in, now. Don't stay out past supper.\" Tom nodded, wentnoff to find his friends. ________________________________________________________________________________ No one was out thatnevening, except an occasional deer. He preferred being alone,nanyways. The path was clear, the air slightly chilly. Naturenbeckoned. Maybe this is what Lawrence enjoyed so much about thenoccasional evening family walks. They had grownncloser that fall. Closer than their parents. No. Mustn't think onnthat. Mama only stayed with Dad because of her five children. Hernfaith differed from his. He was an atheist, she was a believer. Tomnknew they would eventually divorce, as soon as he was out of thenhouse and into college. But college didn't appeal to him. To spendnall that time studying, not enjoying the wonders around you. Howndull. It became veryndark, and he turned to go back, but the path was nearly invisible. nHe was beginning to feel cold. Tom found thenfallen tree from earlier, sat on it, brooded. Got to keep myselfnwarm. Make a fire. But how? He reached into his pocket, pulled outnmatches, smiled. Guess I was lucky. Now for some wood. There was anplethora of branches left from a recent storm. He collected thenshorter ones and soon had a smoking fire going. The wood was wet,nand so it did not provide much heat. But it was something. Animalsnwould not approach a campfire. He resumed his perch on the fallenntrunk. There's no usentrying to find my way back. So damn dark. Well, looks like I'mnstuck out here. Might as well stay out here until I can see better. ________________________________________________________________________________ After about annhour, he fell asleep. His fire went out. Mother Nature took pity onnhim and held back the blizzard that was coming until he woke up. The snow swirlednaround him, encasing everything in a white blanket. A deer trottednpast, searching for shelter. Shelter... Henneeded to get home soon, or he would freeze to death. Tom heard voicesnsomewhere in the blinding storm. \"THOMAS!!!\" That wasnMother. What was she doing out in this weather? \"Lawrence, Incan't imagine what could have happened to- oof!\" She must haventripped. Heard his brother say, \"Are you alright, Mother?\" \"Yes, I'mnfine. You mustn't worry about me. I'm going back in the house. FornGod's sake, go find Thomas. And don't even think of returningnwithout him.\" She sniffled. Mother never cried. I must havenreally got her shook up about this. \"TOM!!!!!!!!!!\"n His brother's voice rang out. Tom couldn't move. nThere was too much snow. Must get warm. He wrapped his jacketnaround him tighter, stuck his hands under his arms, trying not tonfreeze. It scared him tonthink that he couldn't get back to his family, and he was bound tonfreeze before then. He curled up underneath the fallen tree. Rustle. Crack. nRunning footsteps through the forest. \"Lawrence!\" An answering callnfrom behind him. \"Tom!!!\" He glimpsed anlantern held high in the swirling dark and climbed out fromnunderneath the trunk. The man sank down on his knees beside him. n\"Tom, is that you?\" Familiar face. Blue-grey eyes,ndirty-blond mustache. He couldn't quite put a name with it. A warmngloved hand reached out and touched his cheek, then he was engulfednin an embrace so tight he thought he'd be squeezed to death. \"MynGod, Tom. You're still alive. I was afraid you'd frozen!\" Tom said nothing. nHe put his arms weakly around his brother. It was awkward to benembraced like this. Luckily no one was watching. \"Tom? Saynsomething, please. I can't come home with a dead little brother!\" The teenagernblinked. \"...nLawrence?\" The arms around himntightened. \"God Almighty,nwill ya let go? You're gonna squeeze the breath from me!\" His brother didn'tncomply. Apparently he had not heard. \"LawrencenJoshua Chamberlain. Get. Off. Of. Me.\" \"Fine, fine. nI was only seeing if you were alive or not.\" \"Of coursennot!

You could have died .\" \"You care toonmuch.\" \"I care aboutnmy little rogue getting himself into a scrap and having no way out ofnit.\" Tom blushed. He'dnnever given thought to his brother's fears. He had always believednthat the older man wasn't afraid of anything, except maybe God. \"Younknow, Lawrence? I had a dream last night that you were in the army. nBoth of us were. I could see a whole regiment in front o' you. nThere was a hillside in the background. You ordered me to fill anhole in the line of fire, A man in gray had me in his sights.

He noticed a wide gap atnthe hinge of the left flank. \"Tom, go plugnthat hole!\" Rushing past thenother officers standing around, Thomas Chamberlain stabbed his saberninto the soft earth and fired repeatedly in to the wave ofnConfederates charging towards him. He became an easyntarget for the reb sharpshooters. They fell like trees in a stormnunder his deadly accuracy. For the space of ansecond, Chamberlain saw the rifle poke out of the chaos, its sightsntrained on his youngest brother. \"You may eat your wordsnsomeday.\" He was thrown backnto the cold night in Maine. His brother's vision had come true. Thump-thump. nThump-thump. BANG. \"TOM!!!\" nA scream of anguish escaped his lips. Then he saw thenboyish face turn to him, gritting his teeth, expecting pain. Therenwas nothing. Not even a scratch. Someone must have shot the rebel. nWho? Looked over, saw two of the 2ndn Maine men lower theirnrifles and pull out another cartridge. He looked towards Heaven. Thank God. SuddenlynTom was at his shoulder. \"Told ya, didn't I?\" Apparentlynhe had remembered, too. They grinned at one another hugely. nChamberlain reached out to touch him, didn't expect the embrace thatnfollowed. The men regarded him with a questioning look.

To even hold her again was a miracle, to say the least. \"I love you, Abbs.\" \"I love you too John.\" She began to weep.\"You know that wanted to be at your side, John, but my time had come. It's time to move on and I want you now just to not forget about me, but find someone else...You don't have to love her.\" \"All I care about is you, Abbs. Nothing is going to change that.\" But Meyer knew that she would convince him otherwise...He almost knew her too well. \"John. You'll only see me once a year at the most...I can't leave here nor do I have the energy to see you for more for a week.\" \"Then I'll make it count.\" He promised as he caressed her forehead. \"For you and the little one's sake.\" [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[ Cold Harbor National Cemetery June 4th, 2015 John waited patiently for his specter to show up...It's been over a year since he last saw her, but he thought it was worth it. The Hoosier managed to find room in his schedule to take this special trip. \"Nice to see that you finally showed up.\" He smirked. \"Was there a ghost convocation or something?\" \"Johnathan...\"She playfully gasped out in shock. \"Were you worried that I wasn't going to see you?\" Meyer shook his head in amusement at her antics.\"No...Why should I?\" He chuckled. \"It's good to see you, Abbs.\" \"Likewise.\" Foxley smiled...She still could get lost in those blue-gray eyes of his and she sighed happily. He kept his word and she wasn't entirely sure if John would, yet he did...He was a man who always keeps his commitments no matter what. 'He would have been an amazing father and husband.' The woman didn't expect to get pregnant after the lovebirds got it on after a night out drinking... Abby shook her head and focused on the task at hand. \"So how was your year John dearest?\" The blonde hummed as she sat down next to him. \"It was fine... Summer was boring and I'm studying American History at Purdue University.\" \"University? I thought you lived on a farm? How can you afford it?\" John knew she was confused and didn't realize how much the world had changed in one hundred and fifty years. \"Society changed Abbs.\" \"Right...I've forgotten.\" She lamented...The Anglo-Scot mourned that the world she grew up has changed and the home she once knew was gone... \"Hey, Abbs...\" He solaced. Abby was raised in a gentry family just twenty miles outside of Bristol and understandably she was in denial. \"Abigail. It's not your fault...The Empire was in decline after World War I. It was inevitable.\" \"John. I still can't believe it...India, Canada, and Australia are all independent?\" 'This is going to take a while.' John mused.

There was a bomb threat at the Cedar Creek Civil War reenactment and protesters were demanding to take down statues all because of a flag. \"You got to be bloody joking!?\" Abbs shouted in anger. She didn't particularly like the Johnnies, but this was ridiculous! \"I wish that I was.\" John sighed as he told her about the monuments being taken down and the protests going on... \"Still, this matter is unbelievable...Don't the fecking idjits realize that men died for a cause?\" 'She's pretty pissed if she's sound Scottish' John reflected as his girlfriend ranted at the radicals...She was seriously bidialectal and he was still surprised that she speaks in either an upper-class English accent or a Scottish accent at times. \"Oh, they're aware...They just think its all because of slavery and racism and the jackasses keep on shouting racists, racists, and racists.\" She snorted in an unladylike manner...\"So were quite a few of my comrades...These protesters are knobheads. Perhaps if they came here, I'll tell them to bugger off.\" John laughed. \"I can see it now. Ghost of Union Soldier Scares off Confederate Monuments Protesters ... That's not such a bad idea Abbs.\" The blonde blushed...\"Thank you...\"But she became downcasted at a thought. \"Still, do you think it's embarrassing to be in love with a Spirit?\" \"Look, Abbs, you know that I don't care if you're a revenant...I love you.\" \"That you do, dearest.\" She granted the reenactor a peck on the cheek. To John, it felt like a raindrop, but it was one he cherished as he infrequently received them. John looked down on his watch and saw the time. \"Well, Abbs. I guess you need your rest...Take care, Abby.\" The Ghost yawned before she disappears for her eternal slumber. \"Goodnight Jonathan...I hope that I'll see you soon.\" Meyer watched as his girlfriend began to fade, evanescing from view. Before he left, John laid his hands on the gravestone one last time for the evening. \"Sleep well, Abbs... And you too, son...\" John began to depart the cemetery but as he left, the Hoosier could swear that he heard singing...Specifically 'Tenting Tonight on the Old Campground'.

Shadows from the trees fell upon them in places, offering shade. These shadows played across the face of the man walking up one of the paths of the cemetery. He wore a blue coat and forage cap, his graying hair peeking out from under it, symbols of his service to the nation in a war not ten years over. His face was lined with hardship and the memories of what he'd seen and done. He scanned the stones to either side as he walked, before smiling slightly and moving towards a row on his left. \"Well, Myles,\" he greeted, \"Been awhile since we last spoke, aye? I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner, but at least it's quieter now.\" The crowds that had come a week earlier were gone, and the man preferred it that way. Groaning as he eased himself to the ground by the headstone, he continued speaking to his friend, his light Irish brogue filling the warm air. \"And I've been discharged, did you know that? I stayed on for a few more years after the war, and in '68, they said I'd done my bit.\" He chuckled wryly. \"To open up a space in th' ranks for a younger man than myself, I suppose. But I don't mind. \"Things've changed since we were last here,\" he noted, his gaze drifting around the grounds. \"Not just the absence of cannon fire, either. There's statues of all sorts most everywhere you look… \"But you don't need a statue for yourself. If they tried, I'd knock it down, and you might help, too.\" He laughed again. He stayed beside the grave for several more minutes, the one-sided conversation strangely companionable. For he knew exactly what his friend would say if he had been there physically. The two had grown up together, faced war and famine together, and loved and lost and lived. Finally, he fell silent, the only sound the breeze rustling the leaves above his head. With another soft groan, he stood, reflecting that his age was catching up to him. Closing his eyes, Eoin O'Connell said a silent prayer, making the sign of the cross, before going back to the path.

As the men and I marched down the dusty trail, the commander stopped us to let us know we were going to the small town of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania to intercept the confederate army. My heavy woolens and the sixty pounds of equipment made my body feel tired. This summer was especially hot. I noticed several soldiers around me were marching barefoot. There had been news from my father that literally thousands of men fell out of line and got lost while marching already. After several hours of walking, we stopped along the dirt road to get some sleep. I lied down with the thousands of other men like me. The only good part about sleeping outside on the earth was the fact that the clear sky showed the stars above that looked like night lights. When I peeked my head up from the wet, dewy grass, all I could see were the trees and the sleeping bodies of a thousand men. I looked over at a man next to me, a new soldier. I could hear him quietly crying. He was young, about my age. All of the new soldiers around me weren't sleeping. The hard, cold ground was completely different from my bed at home. I wondered how Samuel was doing. Several hours later, it was morning. I got up from the cold, hard ground in which nobody had slept. We were only about two hours away from Gettysburg, according to the same men I was listening to earlier. We began marching as soon as we woke up, leaving without having any food or water. I was starving and thirsty. I began to count the number of times I picked up my feet to march to pass the time, and I counted over a million by the time we got to Gettysburg. As we kept marching along, all of a sudden I saw men in gray uniforms, the uniforms of confederate men. We had finally reached the confederate army. They stood in rows. They were a big group of fighting men, probably well trained, unlike me. The only training I had was when I asked a soldier last night to teach me how to use a gun. Commander Meade rode his horse over to the famous General Robert E. Lee, the general my dad always told me about. I watched commander Meade discuss with the confederate army. Meade thought it was a perfect place to battle with the large rebel army standing right in front of us. Meade walked back to his fellow commanders. That was when, all of the Potomac army soldiers around me turned their muskets towards the confederate army, as if planned. I started to panic, not knowing what to do. I had absolutely no training. The soldier next to me that had helped me learn how to use a gun earlier began to frantically set the gun against my shoulder, so it would be ready for me to shoot. Commander Meade yelled for us to charge, and the first shot of gunfire went off from him. I started running towards the rebel army. As my army and my competitor charged toward each other, I could see blows of smoke rising from guns into the air. For the first time, I shot my gun at a confederate soldier. I missed the first time, and mid-run I shot a second time. He fell to the brown earth, knees first. I had never even been fight with a man back home. I kept running. I hit my rifle across any confederate soldier that got in my way. Instead of running towards confederate soldiers to fight, I was running across the field to escape. Many other new recruits were running towards the woods. They were being shot by soldiers from their own army, as they were labeled as deserters. As I ran across the field, I felt a pain at my leg. I fell to the ground, holding it. As the battlefield around me went dark, I saw a familiar union soldier pick me up. \"You're really brave to run into the battlefield with that much courage and strength for a recruit, but try to be smarter about it next time.\" After that, I must've blacked out. That's how I also must have ended up in the medical tent with an injured leg. The bullet was out of my wounded leg, but I was still hurt. I still wasn't sure who helped me off of the battlefield. They saved my life. Jacob looked at me, as if he expected a more heroic story out of me. There really wasn't. As cowardly as it sounds, at least I thought I wasn't dead. I looked at the ceiling of the hospital tent, and wondered to myself if Samuel was still alive and well. All of a sudden, I watched a man that looked like him walk into the hospital tent. Samuel picked me up and walked me out of the medical tent, as I laid in his arms. Never again could I run away from fear. ","Summary":" Families, and rumored plans of battle from the commanders.

I thought I'd elaborate on the angst of not passing a bit. Hope you folks enjoy. He needs a fandom. XD \"Congratulations.\" I managed through gritted teeth, the syllables sharply accented and forced. I started to walk away, but his extended hand hit me above the waist as I made a desperate attempt to escape from the Winners' Circle of the Point. I gave his hand a stiff shake at the elbow and withdrew, stalking towards a less crowded area of the reception room with my arms folded across my chest. I made my way through the thick crowd and made myself invisible against one of the walls, scowling bitterly and watching my classmates loathingly. Because it was the last day of school for everyone but me, the housing assignments had changed. Thanks to that, I couldn't even go back to my room and leave the public spectacle. A dark haired boy with the barest trace of a mustache looked turned and whispered something to the boy next to him, smirking and turning his gaze back to me. Blood rushed to my cheeks and I looked down at my nails, picking at the thumb of my right with my left hand until I drew a little blood. I pressed my lips together and involuntarily leaned away, my ears burning. The entire Point knew at least half of the embarrassing sequence of events that had led up to this, and if they combined all of their knowledge they'd know more than I did about the situation. I sighed through my nose when I realized that the two had apparently found something better to do, and looked around the room for somewhere else to go until this stupid reception was over. I found a chair and sat down in a corner, watching the bright eyed alumni jealously as they chattered amongst themselves. \"Mr. Hill?\" A piping voice jolted me out of my thoughts. Great. Now they'd gone the whole ten miles and gotten somebody to offer me condolences. Condolences for what? Getting an infection? I turned my head in the instructor's direction, answering in an exasperated, flat tone. Disrespect was so satisfying right now. \"Yes, sir…?\" \"We have the paperwork for your next term,\" he stated, holding out a folded white paper with a key inside. I took it and didn't say anything, waiting for the man to leave so that I could open my papers. After at least five minutes, I think he finally got the idea and left. I should have done some crap quality dramatic opening, but I just split the wax seal on my new letter with the thumb that I had started to pick at earlier and unfolded it. The key slid off of the paper and fell into my hand. I put it into my pocket as I read over the assignment, following the black capital letters. AMBROSE POWELL HILL. ASSIGNED TO DORMITORY 317. I folded the paper back up and stood up from the chair, leaving the room through the exit closest to me and moving down the hall to the lockers. I put in the memorized combination, my hand making a series of twists and jerks before I opened the door. I took out my duffel bag and let it land on the ground with a thud. I picked it up with a groan and started up the stairs, keeping the key in my pocket all the way up to the third floor of the student housing unit. I unlocked the door and pushed it open. It swung, hit the wall, and clicked after me due to its force coming back. I dropped my duffel bag as soon as I was in the doorway and climbed up onto the top bunk, flopping down onto the uncomfortable mattress. I stared at the ceiling for God-knows-how-long. I was interrupted only by a small cough rising from the pit of my chest, then another. I bent over slightly, feeling the aggravated tightness in my chest as I began to hack. The coughing is as if a nail is being sent across my lungs, tearing at them like a mad animal, but I can't stop. A few scarlet droplets dot the pillow under my head. Thank God, eventually it stops. I lay down stiffly on my back, closing my eyes. Oh, God....I've made a terrible mistake...

Let me know what you think! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The sun was setting, the aged Southern General staring out at the washes of red and gold in silence. Despite the beauty of the evening he could not find any joy in it. The days events running through his head. \"We can do it sir! We can reform and hit them again!\" Lee had looked down at the man, dazed. The trust they put in their commander bringing him close to tears as soldiers hobbled their way back across the lines. He had been sure they would break in the center, so sure that this would be the deciding battle. He sat as tall as he could, broken heart thudding violently in his chest. \"Friends listen to me, listen I beg you. It is all my fault.\" The men protested, moral still high. He couldn't believe the strength they displayed at such devastation. \"We will fight another day, but you can never let them see you run. Never let them see you run.\" He could now vaguely hear Longstreet speaking quietly at his side, \"Major Sorrel was giving me the reports on wounded and missing officers-\" Lee's thoughts suddenly flashed to Pickett, standing ghoulishly still, the light playing off his haunted blue eyes. Binoculars hanging limply in one hand, chickaree crushed and beaten in the other. \"General Lee, I have no division.\" Longstreet continued in his subdued tone, \"Armistead is missing, Garnett is feared to be dead-\" The \"Old War Horse\" stopped abruptly at a simple nod from Lee. He watched his commanding officer quietly, leaning forward he placed a rough hand on the elder's shoulder. \"What do you want me to do sir?\" Lee shook his head, unable to voice anything at the moment. Two days ago no one would have seen this outcome. On his invasion of the north Lee had pushed The Army of the Potomac easily through the little town of Gettysburg. Since then there had been misinterpreted orders, missing Generals, and total loss of communication. It had gone downhill from there. Longstreet had fallen silent, staring into the flames of the little fire. Light flickering across his stony features as the sunlight continued to recede. Looking back to his superior he was surprised at how much the man seemed to have aged in the past three hours. Lee stood silently, slowly. He rubbed the knuckles of his right hand, still sore from his outburst with General Stuart. Bidding his second in command goodnight he made his way to the tree line where Traveler stood silently, orange firelight playing off the gray dapples of the horse's pelt. He began leading the horse out of the trees, riding did not seem appealing at the moment. Major Taylor appeared suddenly from the surrounding darkness. He lead his own horse alongside the commander. \"Is there anything I can get for you sir?\" Lee watched the ground carefully, eyes straining through the darkness to see the dusty path in front of him. \"No.\" He paused, \"But I thank you Major Taylor.\" \"My pleasure sir.\" He could faintly see men wandering the fields, could not tell what side they fought for. Did that really matter? Those aiding the wounded did not look at the color of the uniform, sometimes could not tell the color of the uniform. He looked away from the fields, from the group of trees the assault had been planned on, and back to the darkening path in front of him. The air was thick and heavy, rain was definitely looming in the very near future. The lamps of the General's Headquarters came into view and Taylor made to take the dapple gray from the commanding General. Lee refused the help politely and lead the horse through the gate. \"I can manage Major, thank you.\" Taylor proceeded to tend to his own mount and left the General with his thoughts, he knew when the man wished for solitude. It had been a long time since Lee had personally seen to Traveler's needs. He was often very busy reading reports, formulating campaigns and listening to the concerns of his officers. Though right now all he wanted to do was spend some time in silence with the animal that had faithfully carried him out of their home and into unknown territory. The gray let out a puff of air as he settled into the spacious box stall. Stomping now and then while eating the nightly ration measured for him. Lee placed a hand on the horses neck, studying the mottled fur on the horses flank. The rain started slowly, more like a fine mist as he walked from the barn to the little building. He stood at the front door, looking out over the fields he could no longer see anything. The wind picked up rustling through the trees, and was followed with a heavy sheet of rain. It traveled across the field like a regiment in line for battle, moving with the grace and speed of a well trained and practiced unit. It crushed everything in it's path, beating down crops and vegetation in the same way an army corps moving through a field would. Lee stood in the doorway a few moments longer, finally entering the building and shutting the door behind him as the rain reached the stone house. He listened to the storm as it pelted the roof of the building. The sound was usually comforting, tonight it only pushed him into further depression. He kept his eyes closed as he heard Major Taylor enter the room and didn't move when the young man set a mug down on the end table beside him. He was extremely tired, he didn't want to plan, didn't want to think on campaigns. He let the sound of the rain drowned his thoughts until he finally drifted into oblivion. It would be a long day tomorrow.

Sweat makes my gray uniform cling to my back and I feel as if I am swimming in an ocean of it for it is everywhere. And that's not the worst of it. Blood seems to coat the ground that I walk upon, almost making me slip in a few places as I stumbled along, my eyes trained on the open field and the officer directly in front of me. I stand with my back behind a fence, very few have yet to climb over it but we have all stopped and we stare in front of us, deadly fear feeling our hearts and minds. We can see no hope as we have watched those around us be cut up by shells and every other type of gun one can imagine. In truth, I dont know how we can make it, not after watching what we have watched, not after knowing that in almost all the other brigades, they have no General left to lead them. We all know our duty, every last one of us and even from the start I knew that for many of us it would be the end but seeing it in front of me, is more painful then I dare to try and think about. It's easier to try and separate myself from the feelings but I find that impossible, the feelings are going to be with me wherever I go. There is no way to get away from that. It feels as though time is standing still as no one is really moving. There is a boy knelt behind the fence right near me and then suddenly I see General Armistead beside me, reaching down with one hand to touch the man's shoulder. \"Come on boy, come on. What will you think of yourself tomorrow?\" I don't even really hear his words, I think they most have entered through one ear and out the other because I couldn't have repeated it even if I wanted to. Another officer shouts, \"Let's go boys!\" But then he is shot, gone like so many other men that have fallen on this field. My eyes focus on Armistead directly in front of me as he shouts something that yet again seems to go right past me. But then I hear his next words, they are so powerful that they seem to cut right through me, reaching my very heart. \"With me! Who will come with me!\" His hand reaches towards his hat as I watch him and before my eyes he stabs it with his sword. I watch him as he turns and starts running towards the trees, the trees that we are aiming for. And then I force my legs to move, push myself into a run after him. Others are following us, I can hear see them alongside me as he follow Armistead, our leader, the man who we all trust to lead us. Because we all know that he is a soldier, a brave soldier who wants to lead us to victory, no matter how hard it might be. A short wave of hope fills me as I follow him. But it doesn't last for very long. Too many have died already... far too many... Even if we manage to take the stone wall, will it be much of a victory? Before I know it, we are upon it, and Armistead is before me still, climbing up onto the wall and waving his sword. \"The day is ours men! Turn the cannons on them, turn the cannons.\" I follow him onto the wall as he jumps down, runs to a cannon and puts one hand on it. Behind me, the rest of the men follow and hand to hand combat seems to break out all around us as some of us head for the cannons, trying to turn them around. It is confusion everywhere I look and I don't really know where to turn for fear that someone will jump on me. It is then I turn just in time to see it. The bullet cuts through the air and I want to scream out a warning but no sound leaves my dry mouth as I can only watch the bullet sink into Armistead's flesh... my leader, the one who has lead us here. Armistead slumps down against the cannon and I can see the blood on his uniform, feel the panic overwhelm me as I spin around and lock eyes with the one who shot him. He isn't looking at me but I leap on him, clutch my rifle in my hand, and aim it at his throat. The man looks at me for a moment and I close my eyes, the hatred taking over my senses as I stab him. Even without looking, I know that I have killed him and I turn away quickly, come face to face with another Union Soldier who has his rifle pointed striaght at me. My heart freezes in my chest as I look at the open barrel staring directly at me. War isn't right, I marvel at that in the brief instant before the man pulls the trigger and I feel the blinding white pain as the bullet enters my chest. I am still alive but I slump down on the ground, near the cannon where Armistead lies. There is a hand on my shoulder then and though the pain, I crack open my eyes and see Armistead there, also bleeding from his own wound. I stare right at him, barely able to think straight through the pain. Opening my mouth, no sound will come out as I am too weak to move much at all. The bullet is too close to my heart. \"Thank you for all you have done boy, for serving\" Armistead says, and although his voice sounds slightly weak, the words enter my heart as my eyes close again. I have done all that I can do, there is nothing more that anyone can do, and all that I have done will have to be enough. Because now my days are done.

Then my right. Five steps. Ten. How many more? My breath comes trembling and shallow. How many more will I take? I grip the rough wood pole tighter with sweaty palms. A gust of wind – warm, smelling of smoke – makes the flag above me snap and wave faster. I glance up at its colors and remember my reasons for being in this horrid place. I lift it higher. How many steps now? How many breaths? How many cannon balls have roared past? How many men have fallen? How many? The ground shakes under my worn boots. Men not twenty yards from me yell out in pain as they fly through the air. Smoke stings my eyes and leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. We press on. A loud noise, a jarring impact, then the ground. And pain. I try to stand, then fall, yelping. Men march on around me. With an effort I raise my arm, hand still clenched around the flag. Soon a musket is set beside me and a strong hand grabs the pole. With a small cry, I release the beautiful emblem.

It leaves something inside of you which never really goes away. Battle leaves heartache, terror, and death like a long scar over your heart. It I a reminder of how precious your time on earth will always be and the cold pang of grief of losing someone that you have loved. No one can be spared this feeling. It is inevitable. Like our cause diminishing slowly, with pain. This is the way we all felt, after the charge, when the final remaining survivors searched the rotting fields for any sign of life. It had been hours afterward…the Yankees triumphed, but no one even cared. They let us go back to see if we had anyone else to join us as their captives. So, we went. I nearly vomited with the sickly stench of death reaching my nostrils. I kept my eyes downcast, o the ground to be spared the sight of the bloated odies lying in piles over the fields. There was almost nowhere to put youyr feet, for everywhere you stepped there was some reminder of what had happened…a metal bullet…an untouched knapsack…and there was blood. No an inch, it seemed, of the fighting space was spared from the sticky red which latched to the waving weeds, staining the grass crimson. Some of our boys in grey sidestepped the dead and few wounded deliberately…they grabbed satchels and rummaged like dogs through them for valuables, money, anything…But most of us, sat by a lifeless friend…weeping until our tears covered the dirt. I tried not to see the dead's faces staring blankly up at me…ignore the cries of the injured and soon to join the nmoving in a different place…a better place. I wanted to turn around and go back to the prison, go back to a time where there was no such thing in my life as this. But I couldn't. \"Cole?\" A hoarse, almost unintelligible whisper reached my ears. I whirled around several times, desperately trying to find the familiar drawling voice… \"Down here, you idiot.\" I instinctively looked \"down here\" and held back a choking sob. Almost unrecognizable from the cakes of mud, lay Sam. He was breathing so heavily, with wheezing gasps and weak coughs every now and then racking through his chest. He smiled half heartedly, gazing lightly at the stormy sky. I wondered if he was thinking about Heaven. Quickly, I fumbled for my linen canteen, sighing in frustration when only a small amount of water sloshed around inside when I shook it. He eyed it thirstily, then said. \"It's alright, I don't want any.\" \"Liar.\" I convicted. I knelt down beside him, taking his head in my lap and practically shoving the canteen into his mouth. After a moment, he ripped it from my hands and guzzled the rest down his throat. \"See?\" I grinned triumphantly. \"So I'm a bad liar. Got any more?\" \"That's it, I'm sorry.\" I said truthfully. He shrugged with slight disappointment showing. \"I guess it won't really matter now, anyway.\" I narrowed my eyebrows. \"What are you talking about?\" \"Cole, don't kid yourself. I'm hurt bad. I don't have as much time as I had hoped. I wanted to finish the war. I really did. But it seems I was finished by it.\" I still didn't understand. \"But, Sam! The point of coming out here was to look for survivors! You don't look very dead to me.\" \"Not yet.\" He muttered softly. \"You were probably just knocked down…you look fine!\" \"Are you blind?\" Sam chuckled wryly. \"No, don't answer that.\" I would have slapped him, but then I saw why he didn't get up… His right leg sat at an unnatural angle, bent backwards…and his left…was not there. A bloodied stump where a long limb had once been was all that remained, with streams of red pouring out of it like the river rushing in the distance. \"Oh my God.\" I mouthed. I felt sick suddenly, and turned away to deposit my breakfast of hard tack on the ground. \"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!\" I cried, wiping my mouth hastily. \"It's not that bad, really. You'll pull through!\" Sam slowly shook his head. \"Not this time, Cole.\" I wanted to reply sharply, but then he closed his eyes. \"Do you remember,\" Sam began wearily. \"When there was no war? It's very vague now…Sort of blurry. But I remember my mother waving good bye. I remember that she hugged me..she told me that she would see me in a few weeks. For two years she must have worried so much, wondering if I still was alive. Now she doesn't have to worry anymore.\" I felt something wet drop on my hand that was rubbing his shoulder, and felt more tears streaming down my face. \"you don't need to cry for me.\" Sam reached up and weakly brushed he tear tacks away. But I saw he was silently crying too. \"Yes I do.\" I suddenly let out a sob. \"I wish it had been me instead. Then you could have gone home. And you or Ma would never have had to listen to someone tell her…\" \"Can you tell her for me? Please, Cole?\" I shook my head. \"You're going to go back to her. I won't have t tell her.\" \"I'd like that.\" \"You'll go back and see her. And then she'll never let you out of her sight. \"Cole?\" \"Yes?\" \"Tell her that I'm sorry.\" \"And then you'll get married to that girl you told me about…\" \"Sally Parker.\" He reminded me. \"Sally Parker.\" \"In my bag there's a note for my Ma. Can you give it to her?\" I reached for his knapsack and pulled out a crumpled letter. \"Sure, I will.\" \"Thanks.\" He seemed at peace now, as the fading twilight began to rest over the hills. \"You're going to live a long time.\" Sam told me wistfully. \"You'll die an old man with ninety years behind you. You'll se the war end an you'll go back home. Tell them about me. Your children. And then your grandchildren. Promise?\" \"I promise.\" \"I wish I could have shot one more Yankee. Just one.\" \"don't give up!\" I cried. \"I'm not afraid anymore.\" He grinned. That same grin I came to love almost as much as whom it belonged to. \"You're like my brother, you know.\" \"I am your brother, Sam.\" Sam smiled. \"That's a good thing to carry to Heaven.\" Sam grasped my hand and drew breath with increasing slowness in his lingering moments of worlds life. I sat by him, holding his hand until he inhaled for the last time. Sam squeezed my hand in a final act of reassurance and was still. I held that hand. Even when they came and tried to take me away. I didn't let go. Sam's icy stare into the clouds, unseeing. I racked with sobs and struggled against someone pulling me away. It didn't matter anymore. I didn't care. I still clutched the letter to his mother, but looked down in deadened curiosity as I fingered a second, smaller piece of paper inside of it. A young, laughing face looked up at me, with the brown hair tousled and wild as usual. I tightened my grip around the rumpled picture. I couldn't let go. Somebody wrapped an arm around my shoulders. Someone else talked to me. I didn't hear anything. I kept looking back to where Sam lay on the battlefield, with no soul now inside of him. \"I'll tell them, Sam.\" Twenty Years Later Cole Hamilton sat on the bed, vivaciously narrating this very story to his son called Sam. His son listened intently until Cole stopped talking. The old man rose, harboring an old wound, in his heart which had never fully gone away. Sam looked at the picture on the nightstand. Now he knew who the laughing man inside of it was. Cole had not forgotten. ","Summary":" Battle is a terrible thing. It leaves something inside of you which never really goes away.

Something told me it would go on forever. I knew thatnyesterday Lawrence had fell prey to heat exhaustion. I also knew henwould still travel with us regardless of his weakness. When I steppednout of my tent, the sun said it was past breakfast time. My stomachngrowled at the thought of food; a nice hot home-cooked meal made bynMother's loving hands. I went by Sgt.nKilrain's tent, but one of the officers told me he'd gone to deliverna message to Colonel Chamberlain. I saluted him and left to find mynbrother. I wanted to know if he was better. 'Course, he would havendone the same thing for me. I admired the waynhe seemed to throw his position away when in battle. However, if annofficer was cheeky, he'd play the Colonel and put him back in hisnplace. He often did that to me, now that I think on it. Henunderstood that we were brothers in the war, and that seemednaltogether to affect how his decisions were made. If rebel artillerynfired at us, he'd tell me to keep my distance from him. I remembernMother's letter telling him to keep me safe. I know I'm the youngestnof the five of us siblings, but I wasn't 18 anymore. I was 23 andnproud of it. I reached hisntent just as he emerged. \"Morning, Lawrence. How are ya? nYou're lookin' kinda peaky.\" He straightenednup and looked down his nose at me. \"Darn it, Tom, don't call menLawrence.\" He muttered something to Kilrain and strode brisklyntowards the new recruits. 120 mutineers. I followed him inneagerness. The men of then2nd Maine regiment had fallen out of rank and were restingncomfortably beside the officers' shade tree. Their captain was anlaid back man, and he did not address people with respect. \"You'renChamberlain?\" \" Colonel Chamberlain, to you,\" came the curt response. He saluted and said \"Captain Brewer, sir. 118th Pennsylvania. nIf you're the commanding officer, sir, then I present you with thesenprisoners here. And you're welcome to 'em. Lord knows, I had to usenthe bayonets to keep 'em movin'. You have to sign for 'em.\" Lawrence handed me the papers. \"Sign it, Lieutenant.\" Indid so, and returned them to the captain. \"You are relieved,nCaptain.\" Brewer was persistent in his point. \"You're authorized to usenwhatever force necessary, Colonel. You wanna shoot 'em? You gonright ahead. Won't nobody say nothin'.\" Mynbrother glanced at the men. \"I said, you are relieved ,nCaptain.\" The captain saluted once more and left for his own regiment. Lawrence turned to the 2nd Maine boys. \"My name isnChamberlain. I'm the Colonel of the 20th Maine.\" Henlooked them over. \"When did you fellas eat last?\" A soldier spoke up. \"They're tryin' to break us by not feedingnus. We ain't broke yet.\" His face changed from military politeness to a pained look: he knewnthere was almost no time to feed these men. \"They just told menyou were coming a little while ago, so... I'll, uh... get the cookngoing. The meat may be a little raw, but there's not much time toncook. We've got quite a ways to go today, and you'll be coming withnus, so eat hearty. Sgt. Tozier, see to it.\" The flag-bearernran to give the cook an order for a meal for 120 men. \"Well,nyou boys go eat. Then I'll come over and hear what you have to say.\" The soldier who spoke earlier got up. \"Colonel, we've gotngrievances.\" He nodded. \"Come with me. The rest of you boys go eat.\" I came out from under the shade tree where I had been listening tonhim speak. \"Gosh, Lawrence.\" \"Smile. And don't call me Lawrence. Are they moving?\" \"Yes,nsir.\" I hated using formalities, but it was necessary under thenwatchful eye of the 2ndnMaine private who followed him to his chair under the tree. It wasnas if he knew we werenrelated. \"Good. Go make yourself useful and get me some coffee.\" \"Yes sir.\" I left him with the soldier. When I came back, they were deep in conversation. \"I'm sick ofnthese... these gentleman from West Point. Think they can justnpush us around like we was dogs or cows or... or worse.\" Sgt. Kilrain interrupted. \"The courier, Sir.\" He had a message from Colonel Vincent, the commanding officer of ournbrigade: fall in and march at the head of the line. Lawrence sent Captain Clark to collect the 20th Maine. Then he sentnPr. Bucklin to eat with his regiment in the shade of a large tree onnthe south side of the camp. I came to him with news. \"The boysnfrom the 2nd Maine are being fed, Lawrence.\" \"Yeah-... Tom, don't call me Lawrence.\" \"Darn it, Lawrence, I'm your brother .\" He sighed heavily. \"Just be careful about the name business innfront of the men, alright? Just because you're my brother, don't-...nit looks like favoritism- \" I interrupted. \"God Almighty! General Meade's got his own son as his aide-de-camp. \" I put on a hurt look. He wasnbeing unfair. \"Well, that's different. Generals can do anything.\" I glared at him while pouting. \"Nothing quite so much like God on Earth as a general on anbattlefield.\" Lawrence turned his attention to the men seatednunder the tree. I was curious. \"What're you gonna do with them, huh, sir? Colonel, sir?\" He turned and faced me again. I pressed on. \"You can't shoot 'em. You'll never go back tonMaine if you do that.\" He nodded. \"I know that. ... I know. ... I wonder if they do. Now came my favorite part of that day. I had loved listening tonLawrence's resonant voice tell stories when neither of us could sleepna wink. It had a ring to it that morning I had never heard him usenbefore. Perhaps one could call it a sentimental air, filled withnhope. He gathered the Maine recruits around him and spoke slowly, clearly. n\"I've been talking with Private Bucklin. He's told me aboutnyour problem. There's nothing I can do today. We're moving out in anfew minutes, and we'll be moving all day. I've been ordered to takenyou men with me. I'm told that, uh... if you don't come I can shootnyou. Well, you know I won't do that. Maybe somebody else will,nbut... So, that's that. Here's the situation: The whole reb army isnup that road aways waiting for us. So, this is no time for annargument like this, I tell you... We could surely use you fellas. nWe're now well below half strength. Whether you fight or not,nthat's...that's up to you. Whether you come along is... is... well,nyou're coming. You know who we are, what we're doing here, but ifnyou're gonna fight alongside us, there's a few things I want you tonknow. This regiment was formed last summer, in Maine. There were anthousand of us then. There are less than three hundred of us now.\" He paused, remembering the deaths at Fredericksburg. \"Allnof us volunteered to fight for the Union, just as you did. Some camenmerely because we were bored at home. Thought this looked like itnmight be fun.\" Hencaught my gaze and winked. I looked away, feeling the heat rise tonmy face. Fortunately the men didn't notice. \"Some came becausenwe were ashamed not to. Many of us came because it was the rightnthing to do. All of us have seen men die. This is a different kindnof Army. If you look back through history, you will see men fightingnfor pay, for women, or some other kind of loot. They fight for land.n Power. Because a king leads them, or, or just because they likenkilling. We are here for something new. This has not happened muchnin the history of the world .n We are an army out to set other men free. America should be freenground. All of it. Not divided by a line between slave state andnfree. All the way. From here to the Pacific Ocean. No man has tonbow, no man born to Royalty. Here we judge you by what you do ,nnot by who your father was. Here you can be something. Here is the place to build a home. But it's not thenland. There's always more land. It's the idea that we all havenvalue. You and me.\" He came out of his reverie to find thatntheir eyes were glued to him. \"What we're fighting for, in thenend, is each other.\" I swore I saw tears form, but he blinkednthem back. His mind seemed to return to Earth piece by piece. n\"Sorry, I uh... didn't mean to preach. You go ahead. You talknfor a while. If you, uh... if you choose to join us, and you wantnyour muskets back, you can have 'em. Nothing more will be said bynanybody anywhere. If you choose not to join us, well, you can comenalong under guard, and when this is all over, I'll do what I can tonsee that you get a fair treatment, but for now, we're moving out. nGentlemen, I think if we lose this fight,... we lose the war. So ifnyou choose to join us, I'llnbe personally very grateful.\"n He walked over to me, laid a reassuring hand on my shoulder,nsqueezed once, and left to give the order to move out. ________________________________________________________________________________ We had been traveling all morning, and my horse was sluggish. Shendidn't step as carefully as I would have liked, and she almost ran meninto the ranks. I asked the officer watching the 2nd Maine if he couldntake down the number of men willing to join us. He said he had thennumber: one hundred and fourteen. I was so exited. My brother'snwords must have been really effective. I rode up beside him, dismounted, and nearly collided with Sgt.nKilraine, who took my horse as I saluted. \"Hey, Lawrence! Whatnd'ya think?\" I swore under my breath; my brother didn't swearnas a rule and hated it when I did. I suppose it was a brotherlynthing to do to keep me in line. \"What d'ya think?\" \"About what?\" I was overjoyed. \"About the 2nd Maine boys! Whatnelse?!\" He brightened. \"Oh. Are any of them going to join us?\" My face spread into a wide grin. \"Would you believe it? Allnbut six !!!\" His eyes widened. \"What...?! \"I counted by actual vote, an' a hundred an' fourteen voted tonpick up their rifles!\" Now he looked happy. \"Well, I'll be!\" I gripped his jacket. \"You did good, brother! You did real good!!!\" It was an expression we four Chamberlain brothers usednwhen we were too proud of ourselves to say anything else. \"Good, good. Now see to it they march together.\" I had other news for him. \"Sir, Glazier's got the hotheads inntow. There were six of 'em.\" \"Good. Get their names and put 'em in different companies. Inwant 'em spread out I don't want 'em bunched up together.\" I saluted. \"Yes, sir.\" \"See about their muskets.\" \"Yes sir. Colonel, sir.\" I ran off to complete mynnew assignment. ________________________________________________________________________________ July 2, 1863 We had marched to a field near Gettysburg yesterday and set up tents.n I took a nap while Lawrence and Sgt. Kilrain had a deepnconversation. I woke up hearing him mutter, \"Mama's favorite.\" \"Lawrence, what-... What's happening?\" Colonel Vincent himself had come to order us to march to a hill theyncalled Little Round Top. I was sure there'd be fighting today. nHopefully it wouldn't be as bad as Fredericksburg. At least itnwasn't cold and rainy. The colonel led us to a spot in the woods on the southwest side ofnthe hill. On the way there, my brother sent me to look fornstragglers, lagging soldiers. He handed me his pistol, loaded withn10 rounds. \"Keep your distance from me.\" A shell burstnnot 10 feet from where he stepped. \"Another one a bit closer,nand it could be a hard day for Mother.\" \"Lawrence, I... I don't...I-\" He glared at me, slightly annoyed. I left to complete my assignment. ________________________________________________________________________________ When I reached the end of the regiment, the ranks were formednloosely. I tightened the lines, scanned the surrounding area fornrebels and found none in sight. The bugler played the officers' call. I figured that Lawrence hadnhis own plans besides the placement by Colonel Vincent, so I hurriednback to where the colors were posted. Lawrence had his arms crossed. He looked at each of us in turn,ncounting. When he got to me, his eyes watered, but he blinkednfuriously to keep the tears at bay. He cleared his throat and began.n \"Gentlemen, the 83rd Pennsylvania, 44th New York, and 16thnMichigan will be moving in to our right, but if you look to our left,nyou will see that there is no one there. That's because we're thenend of the line. The Union Army stops here. We are the flank. Donyou understand, gentlemen? We cannot retreat. We cannot withdraw. nWe are going to have to be stubborn today. So, put the boys innposition. You tell them to stay down. Pile the rocks up high fornthe best protection you can. I want the reserve pulled up aboutntwenty yards. It's sloping ground, it's good ground. If you havenany breakthroughs, if you have men wounded, if you have a hole in thenline, you plug it with the reserve. How are we fixed fornammunition?\" Captain Spear responded. \"Sir, I think about 60 rounds pernman.\" He nodded. \"Yes, that's good. About 60 rounds. Yes, that's...nadequate. Any questions?\" A cocky officer spoke up. \"Sir, it seems to me the fighting'snon that side of the hill.\" \"Seems to me that we're the back door. Everything's going on atnthe front door.\" His friend chuckled. Lawrence glared to get their attention. An old professor's trick henused in class. \"No. Gentlemen, that hill is steep, it's rocky.n It's bare. To come straight up, it isn't possible. No. The rebnarmy is going to swing round, it's going to come up through thatnnotch, over there.\" He pointed downhill. \"It'll movenunder the cover of trees, trying to get around the flank. Andngentlemen, ... we are the flank.\" He saluted, and thenwhole lot of us officers straightened up and returned it. \"Godngo with you.\" ________________________________________________________________________________ The fight started with the 44th New York. The smoke from the battlenwafted in our direction by an earlier clear breeze. I was terrified.n I had been in a battle before, but it wrenched the courage out of mento think this might be my last. I silently prayed that Lawrence andnI would come out untouched. Before I knew it, the rebs were headed our way. \"Here they come!!!\" Lawrence turned to me. \"I want you to stay with me, but keepndown. You. keep. down. You hear?\" He squeezed my shoulder innreassurance, as if he could sense my fear. \"Buster!\" \"I bet the whole damn reb army is coming this way.\" Sgt.nKilrain limbered along with us as we moved down the line, cautioningnthe boys to keep down and fire carefully. About half an hour in to the fight, we were engaged. The rebs didnnot approach the left flank. I didn't need to use my pistol. Captain Clark came and reported minor head and shoulder wounds to thenright side of our brigade. Then out of the trees came a new regimentnof rebs, aiming for the left. \"They're coming again, boys!nThey're coming again!\" We held for a while longer until yet another regiment came in. \"Indon't think we'll be able to hold another one. Buster, get allncompany commanders up here on the double.\" When we had assembled, he gave orders sharply. \"We're about tonbe flanked. Now here's what we're going to do. I want you to keepnup a good hot masking fire, keep a tight hold on the 83rd, on oldnPennsylvania over there. I want no break in the line. CaptainnClark, that's you. You understand? No breaks. Alright. Right wingnis going to sidestep to the left, thinning out to twice the presentndistance. You see the colors? The colors are going to end up downnto the extreme left. When you reach that point, we are going tonre-fuse the line. We''ll form a new line at right angles. We'llnpull up as much of a reserve as possible. We've got to be able toncounter attack whenever there's a hole. Is that understood? Anynquestions?\" The officers uttered a collective \"no, sir\", and moved tonthin the regiment. It was amazing to watch the whole entire reserve squeeze so tightlyninto two lines. One kneeling, the other standing behind. Mostnlikely the rebs won't hit here, I thought, and we'll use only one orntwo reserves. The area between us and the rebs was masked in smoke. I couldn't seena thing, except for the occasional sun ray that peeked through thentrees, reminding us of the beauty we were missing. That made usnfight even better. Most of us just wanted everything to end, and ifnwe won this fight, it could be the turning point of the war. About two thirds of the way into the battle, Sgt. Kilrain was shot innthe arm. My brother, being a gentleman and a friend of his, ran toncheck on him. \"Ah, it's nothing. Plays hell with me target practice though.\"n Kilrain was a sharpshooter. I had never seen a man who could fire anmusket and hit a reb every time. Now his glory days were just anmemory, God bless him. An officer at his shoulder: \"Colonel, my men are gettin' low onnammunition.\" Lawrence turned to me. \"Tom, go to the 83rd, ask them to sendnwhat they can.\" I ran off behind the line of fire and delivered his request. \"I'm sorry, lieutenant, but we ain't got nothin' either,\"nwas the disappointing reply. I swore under my breath, then saluted and ran back. When I returned, I noticed my brother's sheath was bent slightly. nHad he been hit? \"Lawrence! They can't send help form the 83rd. ThenPennsylvania boys said they got troubles of their own!\" He swore heavily. I didn't know he knew that many words. He mustnhave learned a lot from his students. \"Colonel, would like to report.\" Sgt. Owen saluted andnwaited. \"what, What, WHAT?!\" \"Colonel Vincent is badly wounded.\" I was devastated. There was too much death in war. It needed to endnnow. I could feel the anger rising, tried to control it, but failednmiserably. \"He got hit a few minutes after the fight started. We've beennreinforced at the top of the hill by Weed's brigade up front. Thisnis what they tell me. But Weed is dead. And so they moved Hazlett'snbattery of artillery up there. But Hazlett's dead. As far as I canntell-\" \"Is there any way you can get ammunition from up there?\" \"I don't know, sir. Everything's a mess. But they're holdingngood. The rebs are having a hard time coming up that hill. It's ansteep hill.\" \"Well we're going to need the ammunition.\" Another officer arrived. \"Colonel, sir. The better of my mennare wounded. If the rebs come up that hill any stronger, I don'tnthink we can hold 'em.\" \"Send out word to take ammunition from the wounded. Make everynround count. Go!\" Sgt. Kilrain lifted his carbine. \"Here they come again!!!\" I was seething in rage against Death. I could kill the whole damnnreb army, and it wouldn't be enough revenge. The rebs had advanced farther than I could've ever believed. I shotnwith deadly accuracy. I don't know how many I picked off; 20, 30,nmaybe 40. I had 10 shots left when Lawrence sent me to plug a holenin the ranks. To this day, he regrets doing it. I knelt, stabbed mynrapier into the ground next to me and pulled out my pistol. \"Tom, watch your left!\" While I reloaded, he covered me,nand I did the same. We made a great team until I had one bullet leftnin the carriage. I didn't tell him about it; he'd heard enough fromnthe officers already. I shot a reb officer with his pistol pointednat me, and then I had nothing left. I aimed at a reb private, hisnsights trained on me. I heard Lawrence's voice cut through the smoke. \"TOM!\" The hammer of my pistol clicked down on an empty cap. \"TOM!!!!!!\" BANG. Lawrence and I turned in relief to see who had spared my life. Itnwas Pr. Bucklin. I nodded to him in thanks. He shrugged, as if tonsay, \"it's nothing\" and saluted me. I returned it, andnturned to Lawrence. \"Sorry.\" He exhaled slowly, as if he had been holding his breath for thatnspace of an eternity between me and the now-passed-on rebel private. n\"Thank God,\" he muttered, just loud enough for me to hear. I got up slowly, breathing hard. I didn't use my pistol much as anrule before that battle, so I was surprised to see that all of mynshots had hit and killed. I must have been braver than I gave myselfncredit for. Captain Spear reported in. \"Sir, half my men are down. Most ofnthe rest are wounded. The left is too thin, sir.\" \"How is our ammunition?\" \"It's almost gone, sir.\" A voice called out. \"Sir, we're running out. We don't havenmuch left to shoot with. Some boys got nothin' at all.\" \"Sir, sir. What do we do for ammunition, sir? My boys had tonpick up reb muskets and are firing back with them. Sir, we oughtanpull out!\" Lawrence shook his head. \"No, we can't do that.\" \"We can't hold 'em again, sir. You know that.\" \"If we don't hold them, they'll go on by, and over the hill, andnthe whole flank caves in. I glanced at the rebs coming up the slope. There were a lotnof them. Maybe the officer was right. We had no choice but to pullnout. \"We can't run away. If we stay here, we can't shoot. Let's fixnbayonets.\" Everyone stared at him in surprise. A bayonet charge? Was thencolonel crazy? \"We'll have the advantage of moving down the hill. They gottanbe tired, the rebs. They gotta be close to the end if we are, so fixnbayonets. Ellis. Wait, Ellis, you take the left wing, I'll take thenright. I want a right wheel forward of the whole regiment.\" Captain Spear stared in disbelief. \"What, you mean charge?\" \"Yes, but here's what we're going to do. We're going to chargenswinging down the hill. Just like we pulled back the left side ofnthe regiment, now we're gonna swing it down. We swing like a door. nWe're gonna sweep them down the hill just as they come up. nUnderstand? Does everybody understand?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Ellis, take the left wing. When I give the command, I want thenwhole regiment to go forward singing down to the right.\" \"All right, sir. Fine.\" Captain Spear nodded. \"Move.\" He hurried to the other end of the regiment to tighten the leftnflank. It didn't matter; we were going to charge at thendouble-quick. In military terms that meant run like crazy, but runnsimultaneously. Lawrence almost screamed. \"Bayonets!!!\" The command shot like a bullet through the ranks. I didn't need tonrepeat the word as I ran to the end of the right flank. Lawrencencaught up with me, waited impatiently for the regiment to preparenitself. \"Draw!\" \"Bayonets!\" \"Left wing, right wheel. Charge.\" Captain Spear flung his rapier in an arc around his head, signaling anright wheel. \"Charge!!!\" The men moved faster than I thought possible. They were just asnloaded as their guns should have been. My brother waited until the regiment was straightened out before henyelled, \" CHARGE!!! \" The whole line of the regiment swung down the hill. It was glorious.n I couldn't stop running towards the rebs. It's a miracle I didn'tnget shot or impaled. ________________________________________________________________________________ July 3, 1863 I sent a detail out that morning to search for any remaining bodies. nI asked them to take what they could from the dead, but they were notnto lay a finger on the living, unless it was a reb. Then they couldntake him prisoner. They came back with a small amount of ammunition and some coffee. Inthought of Lawrence, sitting on a rock at the summit, and had themnbrew some for him, and since I knew he was sitting alone, Inpersonally delivered it. \"Colonel, sir.\" I handed him the mug. \"What're youndoin' up here?\" \"Oh, just resting my leg.\" He accepted it, drank, andnsmiled at me. I returned it, and sat next to him, my legs crossed, hanging over thenledge of the boulder. \"Alright. ... Sure can see a-ways fromnhere.\" He nodded. \"Yeah. Where 've you been?\" I told him about the detail, and he grimaced. \"You're a ghoul.\" He sipped his coffee, deep-set blue eyesntrained on the foliage spread before us. \"Lawrence?\" He turned his head to look at me; hearing his nickname on my lipsnalways got his attention, but this time there was no reproachful wordnabout my lack of formality. \"You did real good yesterday. The way them rebs just keptncomin'. You had to admire 'em.\" His voice was softer than normal. \"Yep.\" \"Think they're gonna come again today?\" He turned back to the forestry. \"Doesn't look like they'renplanning to leave.\" Cannon fire rang out to the north. I rested my hands against the ledge. \"We don't have but anhundred men. Even with the whole flock from the 2nd Maine.\" \"This position's good,\" he muttered, half to himself. More cannon fire. \"Diversion.\" I looked at him questioningly. \"Go alert the pickets. That may be a diversion down there. nThey may be coming this way again. Alright?\" He handed thenempty mug to me. \"And where's that ammunition I asked for, huh?n Go check the hospital, see about the boys, and check on Buster. Nownrun along.\" \"Yes, sir. We're gonna need ourselves another runner. If Inkeep comin' up an' down this hill, my legs are gonna fall off!\" nI sprinted to the pickets, relayed the message, saluted, and tore offnfor the hospital. ________________________________________________________________________________ When I got there, the sight made my stomach turn, and I reeled,ncatching myself on a nearby tree. I couldn't breathe without fear ofnlosing my last meal. My body eventually calmed itself down, and Inwalked through the mass of blood and limbs until I found a lieutenantnwith the casualty count. \"Sgt. Kilrain was here, sir, but he...\" The man bit hisnlip. I almost burst into tears, but remembering my manners I blinked backnthe excess moisture from my eyes and laid a comforting hand on hisnshoulder, just the way Lawrence would have done. \"Where is hennow?\" The lieutenant turned his eyes toward the sky, and I knew he had notnsurvived the amputation \"I was with him when he... well, younknow. He sent a message to Colonel Chamberlain. Do you know where Incan find him?\" \"Better yet, I can relay it personally. He's my brother.\" nI caught his glance and held it for the briefest moment. We were thensame rank, so formalities didn't matter. \"He says...\" He choked up, correcting himself. \"He said to tell him goodbye, and that he was sorry.\" There was no way on Earth I could have delivered that message withoutnbawling in front of my brother. If God had put me on this Earth tonbe the bearer of bad news; well, then. I couldn't bear it another minute. I saluted, promised to delivernthe message, and ran off behind the hospital. I needed to findnsomewhere quiet where I could cry unheard. Every inch of ground wasntaken. I hurried to where our regiment was encamped. My brother was in the middle of giving orders for the placement ofnthe tents. I waited politely until the officers had left. Badntiming for formalities. My voice caught in my throat. \"Lawrence.\" He turned in annoyance. \"Thomas Chamberlain, I thought I toldnyou not to- Tom? Tom!\" I saw navy blue, then black, then nothing. ________________________________________________________________________________ When I came to, he was bent over me, with the worried expressionnMother wore when we were unwell. \"Tom?\" I tried to sit up, but he said, \"I don't want you moving justnyet. You were out for a good hour or so.\" I sank back againstnmy pillow. \"I have a message to relay, Lawrence.\" He nodded. \"I figured that was why you came. I've sent Sgt.nOwen for the casualties, by the way. What did you find out? Havenyou seen Buster?\" I couldn't help but let tears form; we were alone, it didn't matternhere. I repeated word for word what the lieutenant had said. He gotnoff the stool, sat on my bed, and pulled me close into a lovingnembrace. I cried openly, holding nothing back. I didn't carenwhether or not the men heard; they knew we were brothers, and hownclose we were. \" Shhhhh ... I'm right here, Tom. I'mnright here... \" He hummed a lullaby from our childhood, hisnresonant tenor voice ringing strangely. I felt moisture on mynshoulder and realized he was crying too. When I had calmed myself enough to breathe regularly, he let go. n\"Don't tell the men.\" I nodded, pulling out a handkerchief to wipe away the tears. \"Inwouldn't. You know that. What's to tell? Every man's gotta havenhis moments. You know what I mean? It's not like it's unnatural.\" Lawrence blinked several times. I handed him the handkerchief. \"Thanks, Tom.\" I looked away, embarrassed. He never thanked me anymore, hadn'tnbothered with it until now. \"Well, guess I should be going. Ellis wants a word. Send fornme if you need anything, and get some sleep.\" He took anreluctant step towards the tent entrance, as if he would have rathernstayed. I lay back and closed my eyes. There was a small orchestranplaying a soft tune, and the last thing I knew was Lawrence's tenornharmonizing in and out of the musicians' melody.

The people theynchose for the various roles played their parts to perfection (JeffnDaniels practically could be Chamberlain's twin, the late RichardnJordan's performance as Armistead was heartwrenching at times, StevennLang was perfect as Pickett, and the great Sam Elliott as Buford wasnanother excellent touch), and the soundtrack was fantastic. Wish TednTurner would go ahead and make The Last Full Measure ,nbut I seriously doubt we'll ever see it, as sad as that statement is. Originally,nI didn't think I could write a fanfic based on this movie, but then Ingot to thinking, which of course got the creativity going, and thisnis the result. Disclaimer: Creighton, Branche, Myrna, Sally, and a few minor characters arenmine; the rest are history's. NOTE:nI took some liberty about how quick people got their new insignianafter being promoted. AtnThe End of Three Days... DAYnONE - 1 July 1863 Whennthe first thump that signaled distant artillery fire wasnheard, Captain Jacob Creighton, C.S.A. could scarcely believe hisnears. As his infantry company marched along with the rest of Heth'sndivision toward the town of Gettysburg, all he'd expected to findnthere - along with Heth and probably the rest of the division - hadnbeen a few armed militia. Now, as they marched onward - and the soundnof artillery grew ever louder - reports were coming back that saidn'militia' was dismounted cavalry. Rumor had it the unit was Buford'sndivision. Creighton winced slightly; he'd heard briefly of Buford'snreputation as a commander, and knew the division had a tough fight onnits hands now, especially when word came down that apparentlyninfantry support had arrived in the form of Reynolds' 1st Corps. Ordersnto deploy the troops were shouted, and quite a few of Creighton'snboys let forth with the Rebel yell, eager for a brawl. With thenbattalion stopped like the majority of the division due to the Yankeencavalry in front of them, Creighton swung down off his horse andncautioned his men to save their strength for the coming fight. Henpaused a moment to think of his beloved Sally Anne, waiting for himnback home in Corinth, Mississippi. Yes, she was his beloved, but shenwasn't his , per say. No, she'd chosen to bestow her affectionsnon Walter Branche, a young man who aspired to become a lawyer and onenwho took great pleasure in rubbing that fact in Jake's face. Sonrather than stay home and have that joy day after day, Jake hadnenlisted three days after Fort Sumter. As he was one of the first tonsign up, he was immediately awarded a commission, and was ordered tonHarper's Ferry, Virginia soon after. Creightonnsighed as he remembered his last meeting with Sally... o0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0o Julyn1861 Newly-commissionedn2nd Lieutenant Creighton tethered his horse and then walked up thensteps of Myrna Cale's boarding house, brushing rainwater off hisnnewly-issued C.S.A. cloak as he did so. Gathering his courage, henknocked lightly, and a welcoming smile came over Myrna Cale's facenwhen she saw who was at the door. \"Jake!nC'mon in here! Ain't seen you around in awhile...where you been?\" \"Hadnsome things to take care of, ma'am,\" he replied, causing Myrnanto roll her eyes. \"Hownmany times have I told you not to call me 'ma'am'?\" shenadmonished good-naturedly. \"We don't stand on ceremony a lotnaround here.\" Jakennodded and had the good grace to look sufficiently chastised as Myrnanmotioned for him to hand her his cloak. \"Jake!\"nthe voice coming from the top of the stairs made him stop what he wasndoing and look up. Therenshe was Sally Anne Cale, her blue eyes dancing with mischief, smilenbewitching, and her dark brown hair shimmering in the lamplight. Shenwas - as always - exquisite. Sally hurried down the stairs and stoodnbefore him, smiling widely. Jake returned her smile courteously, butnhe refused to allow her to play with his emotions any longer. \"Wherenhave you been? You stopped coming to see me,\" she poutednslightly, but whereas in the past Jake would've been making a fool ofnhimself trying to apologize for his grave oversight, now her actionsnhad no effect on him whatsoever. \"LikenI was just telling your mother, I had a few things to take care of,\"nhe replied, finally removing his cloak and handing it to Myra,nrevealing his new 2nd Lieutenant's uniform. Myra inhaled in surprise,nand Sally looked at him in dismay. \"Younenlisted?\" her voice was thick with hurt. Jakennodded. \"I just stopped here to say goodbye...I'm leaving fornHarper's Ferry, Virginia tonight.\" Sally'sneyes filled with tears and she ran back up the stairs crying. Jakenwatched her go before turning back to Myrna. \"Inbetter get down to the train station...I'll write you when I can.\" \"Writenher too,\" Myrna replied, looking at the ceiling as she referrednto Sally. \"Her reaction to your uniform proved something...thatngirl loves you , not that pompous lawyer-boy.\" Jakendidn't voice the opinion that Sally sure had a funny way of showingnit. Instead, he merely smiled and hugged Myrna goodbye. Henwas back on his horse and about to leave when the front door openednand Sally ran out onto the porch, a shawl over her head to protectnherself from the rain. \"Whynare you doing this, Jake?\" she pleaded, her voice thick withntears. Jakenthought about replying with something about 'The Cause', but knewnSally would never buy it. He sighed and decided to go with the truth. \"Becausenthere's nothing here for me now...you've made your choice, and I'mnnot it.\" \"Jake...\"nSally's voice broke and her shoulders shook with sobs. \"Pleasencome back...promise me you will...\" she choked out, and Jake metnher eyes for a few moments before replying. \"Donsome growing up while I'm gone, and I'll come back to see you whennthis is all over...I promise.\" Sallynnodded solemnly, and Jake rode off without looking back. o0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0o Jakenshook himself out of his reverie, remembering how much he'd yearnednto kiss Sally that night, but knowing that if he had, he probablynwouldn't have left. He wrote the Cale family regularly, and told themnwhat he could of the war. Henremembered being at Fredericksburg, and shuddered at the carnage he'dnseen wrought amongst the Union forces there. His CO had been killednby a lucky shot, and he'd taken his place, with a promotion to 1stnLieutenant along with it. He'd mourned along with rest of the Southnafter Jackson's death after Chancellorsville, and wrote Myrna andnSally of how nice the funeral had been done, simultaneously informingnthem of his promotion to Captain. \"Battalion,nat the double quick, march!\" came the voice of LieutenantnColonel Markson, the Battalion Commander, followed by the voice ofnthe second-in-command, Major Watkins, echoing the order. \"Atnthe double quick, boys!\" Creighton yelled, running onto thenfield to deploy, his company following behind him. They deployednoutward like usual, aimed and fired like usual, and men fell likenusual, but it was as if this particular fight was different for somenreason. Creightonnknelt on the line, took out his pistol, and fired three shots towardnthe enemy. There was a crack of rifle fire and a puff of smoke fromnthe enemy line in front of him, and the man beside him, CorporalnSlocum, went down, shot through the head. Creighton rolled to hisnright, behind the line and out of fire, before standing back up toncommand his troops again. Henglanced out at the battle. There...could it be? Am I seeingnthings, or are soldiers moving back from the line? Yes! They'renbreaking! Henmotioned to Private Murphy, his runner. \"Gonover to F Company and ask Captain Sartain to meet with me herenbriefly, with my compliments.\" Aboutntwo minutes later, Lieutenant Forsythe, second-in-command of FnCompany, was standing before him saluting. \"Where'snSartain?\" Creighton demanded. \"Dead,nsir...I'm in command now. What are your orders, sir?\" \"Thennext artillery salvo after this one, I want you and your boys to givenmy company a nice, strong masking fire...those bluebellies arenbreaking and my company's gonna rout 'em!\" Forsythenlooked at Creighton briefly as though he were a reincarnation ofnJackson before saluting smartly. \"Yes,nsir!\" Henran back to his own unit as Creighton turned to his men and cautionednthem to get ready to run. He glanced back to see General Heth,nLieutenant Colonel Markson, Major Watkins, and their staffs watchingnthe battle from afar. Thenartillery thundered again...the signal! Forsythe's company blastednaway with their rifles, adding to the smoke. Creighton drew his sabernand motioned toward the enemy. \"Forward,nboys! They're breaking!\" Hisncompany responded with a Rebel yell and charged after him. ThenYankees were stunned at the sight of Rebels charging at them from outnof the artillery smoke, and some fired one last time before turningnand running. Ancannon boomed, there was an explosion nearby, and suddenly Creightonnfelt himself flying backwards. He landed hard, the breath beingnknocked out of him, and his saber clattering to the ground nearby. Henlaid there for a few moments, getting his breath, before attemptingnto sit up. He was fairly surprised when he found he could do soneasily. He patted his body briefly, even more surprised to find nonserious wounds save for a few minor scrapes and bruises. Henglanced toward the enemy line, and saw his men had a firm hold on it.nRunning feet from behind him soon turned into the sight of Forsythe'snmen going to join his own, and Forsythe was beside him moments later. \"Captain...arenyou all right, sir?\" Creightonnnodded as Forsythe and his Color Sergeant helped him to his feet. \"Itnwould seem so.\" AnRebel yell sounded from what used to be enemy territory. Four of thenenemy cannons had been turned around and were now being loaded tonfire on their own troops, which were now slowly falling back throughnGettysburg. Creighton could only watch dazedly as more of hisncompany's battalion surged forward. His initiative had won the day. o0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0oo0o0o ThatnNight Creightonnstood outside Lieutenant Colonel Markson's tent. The Colonel hadnsummoned him about half an hour ago, but had kept him waiting evernsince. He knew this was partially for intimidation purposes, andnforced the seemingly-interminable wait not to get to him. Footstepsnbehind him caused Creighton to turn. Lieutenant Polk, Markson's aide,nwas standing nearby. \"ThenColonel will see you now, sir,\" he stated courteously andnsaluted. Creighton returned Polk's salute and stepped insidenMarkson's tent. Marksonnwas sitting on his cot, smoking his pipe. He glanced up atnCreighton's entry, but then returned to his thoughts. \"Sawnwhat you did out there today...damn foolish thing, risking your boysnlike that. Them Yankees could've mowed every last one of you down,nand you know it.\" Creightonnstarted to defend himself, but Markson spoke over him. \"Itnwas also a damn fine piece of soldiering, and General Heth was mostnimpressed with it. He mentioned you in his report to General Lee,nwho's given you new orders.\" Creightonnwaited expectantly. \"You'venbeen transferred to command of a battalion in Barksdale's brigade,nand promoted to Major. Congratulations.\" Creightonndazedly shook Markson's hand and was then ordered to get a newnuniform jacket before heading over to his new assignment. In lessnthan two hours, he had his new jacket, and he'd reported to GeneralnBarksdale, who was quite pleased to have another Mississippian in hisncommand. Henwas sitting on his cot in his new tent when he heard a voice outside. \"Permissionnto enter, sir?\" Creightonngave permission as he rose from his cot, turning and setting up hisnfew personal possessions on the small table he'd been given: hisnpersonal Bible, and a folding picture frame containing a picture ofnhis late mother on one side and the 23rd Psalm in her own handwritingnon the other. His framed picture of Sally he always kept over hisnheart, no matter what. Thenvoice he heard next made him grin with relish, knowing a situationnfrom his past had now been reversed. \"CorporalnWalter Branche, sir...battalion runner.\" \"Pleasurento see you again, Corporal,\" Creighton replied, laughingninwardly when he sensed Branche's confusion. He turned to face hisnold adversary. \"MajornJake Creighton, your new Commanding Officer.\" Branche'snexpression darkened considerably at the sight of Creighton. \"Yes,nsir,\" he replied stonily, fixing his gaze straight ahead. \"Andnhow is Sally?\" Creighton asked, and Branche smirked conceitedly. \"Verynwell, sir...we plan to marry the next time I manage to make it home.nI'll admit she was somewhat unsure at first, but I managed tonconvince her marrying me was the best choice for her.\" Firenblazed in Creighton's eyes as he thought of how Branche might haven'convinced' Sally, but his murderous train of thought was halted whennBranche continued to speak. \"I'dnbe on my way home right now had that damn fool Heth not stumbled intonthe Yankee Army today.\" Creighton'snmurderous train got going again as he got in Branche's face. \"Younlisten here, Corporal ,\" he snarled, stressing Branche'snjunior rank, \"you're referring to a superior officer, so I'dnbest hear you showing him the respect his rank deserves, do younunderstand me?\" Branchenappeared to pout like a petulant child at Creighton dressing himndown. \"Yes,nsir.\" \"Dismissed,\"nCreighton snapped, and watched as Branche stalked out of the tent. Henshook his head sadly once Branche had gone, knowing the Corporal'snattitude was something he'd have to deal with sooner or later. Hentook off his uniform coat and draped it over the back of a chair,nsighing wearily as he sat down on his cot and removed his bootsnbefore lying down. He initially thought he'd be much too keyed-up tonsleep, but it seemed like the second his head hit the pillow, thenexcitement of the day caught up with him, and he fell asleep almostnimmediately. UpnNext: DAY 2: What happens with the situation betweennCreighton and Branche? And how will our young Major from Corinth farenwhen he goes in with General Barksdale's brigade? R&R;!

XD This is set the night before the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864, in the Confederate camp. Ben Axton's son, Jake, is 16 and has followed his father to war against Ben's wishes. Ben has a rather distant relationship with his son, leaving Jake to long for his father's approval. Ben doesn't know how to close this emotional gap and turns to his old friend Burl for help. \"Why didn't I just send him home, Burl? He's gonna get himself killed out there.\" Ben paced by the campfire, frown lines etched into his brow. \"He's as stubborn as you, Ben, you know that,\" Burl spoke up from his place, watching his friend. \"Once your mind's made up, there's no goin' back, and you two've butted heads enough times for that to be clear.\" Ben sighed, raking a hand through his unwashed hair. \"I just worry about him,\" he admitted, looking off into the darkness. \"He's my son, my youngest boy.\" \"You could show him more attention than you have in the past, 'n' maybe he'd understand that,\" Burl noted, gesturing briefly with his cigar. \"But seems to me you hardly glance at him now. Why?\" Ben looked at his friend for a moment. \"I don't have an answer for that.\" \"Don't have or don't want to say?\" Burl lifted his eyebrows. \"For cryin' out loud, do you have to make everything that much more complicated?!\" Ben burst out. \"It is what it is, Burl! I can't help that!\" Burl sighed, raising a hand in a calming gesture. \" 'm not sayin' that. I'm saying you need to let him know you actually care about him. No tellin' what might happen the next day. And if either of you get killed with this space between you, it's a breach that might never heal. \"Holes in a line can be patched, filled with more men. Holes in the heart can't always have that done.\" Ben looked at Burl for a long moment, his mouth twisted in an unreadable expression. \"How do you do that?\" he asked. \"I thought you never completed school past fourth grade.\" \"Third,\" Burl corrected him. \"The toad-frog in the teacher's desk was the last straw.\" Ben rolled his eyes. \"Oh, yes. The frog.\" \"Utter chaos in the room,\" Burl smirked. \"Got kicked out the same day.\" \"Thank God it wasn't the same for Jake. He never caused that much trouble.\" \"Almost wish he had. He's a lot like you, y'know? Serious.\" Ben smirked. \"Wishful thinking,\" he said. \"Better get to bed. Tomorrow's gonna be hell to pay otherwise.\" \"It'll be hell to pay no matter how much sleep we get,\" Burl bared his teeth in a grin. Standing, he pulled Ben into a one-armed embrace, slapping him on the back. \"Good luck, you old reprobate.\" \"You're one to talk,\" Ben retorted, stepping back and moving off toward his tent. \" 'Night, Burl.\" \" 'Night, Ben.\" The candles in their tents went dark and the two old soldiers slept.[Chapter 2] Jake lay in the tent, slouch hat under his head as a pillow. Burl had managed to appropriate the shelter from somewhere awhile ago; Jake hadn't asked where from, but he strongly suspected it was of former Federal issue. Sleep hadn't found him yet tonight, though. He rolled to his side, glancing at the firelight flickering through the canvas walls and the silhouettes beside the flames. He listened, recognized his father and Burl's voices. Ben Axton was pacing back and forth as if he was a mule tormented by gnats. The two men's voices were too low for Jake to catch full sentences, but he heard a few phrases. \" – gonna get himself killed out there… \" \" He's as stubborn as you are… mind's made up, there's no goin' back .\" An exasperated sigh from Ben. Jake bit his lip, instantly recognizing they were talking about him. He slowly sat up, feeling a vague flash of guilt for listening in. \" D'you have to make everything that much more complicated? \" Ben's voice suddenly rose and Jake flinched. Although Ben had never raised his hand to his children, it wasn't unfamiliar for Jake to hear his father's raised voice. And even then, outbursts from the senior Axton were rare. Ben was normally a taciturn man, keeping his thoughts hidden behind a stern mask. It was that silence that hurt Jake the most. At least when Ben yelled, Jake knew his father was paying attention to him. The 16-year-old shook off his thoughts and began listening again. The two men's voices had quieted. A slight chuckle came from Burl, followed by a snort from Ben. Jake relaxed, knowing his father was in a better humor than a few minutes ago. A few more words were exchanged, then footsteps approached the tent, and Burl slipped inside, blowing out the candle. He and Jake shared a tent, as they were enlisted men and Ben was an NCO. Jake had quickly ducked back down, feigning sleep as Burl entered. He smelled fragrant tobacco smoke from Burl's cigars clinging to the older man as Burl lay down next to him. \"Burl?\" Jake mumbled, as if just waking up. \"Heard all that, did'ja?\" the older Confederate raised a brow in the dark; he'd known Jake for too long to be fooled. Jake bit his lip and nodded. \"A bit,\" he admitted quietly. Burl sighed and rolled over, his hands behind his head, didn't reply. Jake hesitated to ask further; the night before battle was uneasy for most everyone. He didn't want to make it worse. \"Speak your piece, boy,\" Burl said at last. Jake blinked, he'd thought the older man was asleep. He was silent for another moment. \"Does Pa really care about me?\" \" 'Course he does,\" Burl replied. \"You saw how worried he was after you nearly drowned that time.\" He glanced over at the teen. \"Fact is, he don't always know how to put his thoughts to words. But he tried to show it.\" \"By yellin' at me, 'n' ignorin' me?\" Jake's question had clear bitterness laced into it. \"Might seem odd, but it is. He don't know how to show it, say it out loud, quite. When he scolds you, it's his way of sayin' he was worried about you. You see what I mean?\" Jake slowly nodded, mulling it over. \"Wish he could say it, though…\" he said quietly. Burl nodded. \"I know, boy. But he'll say it when he's ready and no time but. Just wait 'n' see.\" Jake nodded silently. \"Tomorrow'll be a hell of a fight, from what I know,\" the older man continued. \"Better get what rest we can before then.\" He yawned enormously and rolled over again, drawing his blanket snugly around himself. Within moments, his snores filled the tent. Jake was not long behind him. The near drowning incident Burl mentions is a nod to both the RP and history itself. In our scenario of the CS crossing of the Potomac after Gettysburg, Jake was swept away by the high river water and subsequently rescued by Burl. This incident is based off an anecdote from Gen. Longstreet's memoirs, where a wagon was nearly swept off the bridge in a similar fashion, but recovered safely.

They were still trying to fight against it, tear at the boys in blue beyond, give a punch that would travel all the way to the ears of Washington, but those same boys in blue kept rising from the smoke, bursting through like ghosts of this terrible, terrible War.

He had tried to see through the smoke, look for the figure on the horse, and he thought he saw him once before the smoke stole him away and he wasn't sure if he'd seen anything at all. He closed his eyes, tried to find a place of peace, but he could only see California. If I ever raise my hand against you, may God strike me dead. It was coming now, he knew it. May God strike me dead… There was suddenly a voice through the smoke, close by but still very soft. He murmured Win's name, still in California, and tried to turn his head, see the man who was still holding him steady. It wasn't him. It was a young Yankee officer surrounded by other Union men. ''Sir…'' he was saying and he saw he had kind eyes, concerned. He couldn't have been anything over 20. ''Sir, can you hear me?'' He tried to say something but to begin with, nothing came out. His eyes rolled back to the heavens momentarily, then back to the young man beside him who was squeezing his hand, attempting to comfort him or keep him on this Earth. ''Sir?'' ''Can you – help me up – please?'' he heard himself say, then wondered if he had said it at all. ''Sir, can you tell me what your name is? Who you are?'' For a moment, he couldn't think of his own name. He stared at the officer, his vision clouding suddenly so all he could see were soft, coloured shapes and the fuzzy line of that copse of trees, so very close, but still so very, very far away. His name…No, that didn't matter. Win. Where was Win? ''I would like to speak with General Hancock. Do you know where General Hancock may be found?'' Through the blur and smoke, he saw the boy's expression change. What is it? Tell me, tell me… ''I'm sorry, sir…'' he said. ''The general's down. He's been hit.'' The sharp pain that had faded for a while now came burning back, attacking his chest and throat, and he choked on its horrid grip, tears rolling down his cheeks. ''No!'' he cried out. ''Not both of us! Not all of us! Please, God!'' The hands held him steady, squeezing softly and he felt it again. May God strike me dead… No, Win, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry… He tried to close his eyes, say a small prayer, anything, anything, but the words wouldn't come and suddenly, all he could hear was the sound of the guns, the screams of his men, this War…this terrible, terrible War… Not like this, please God, not like this… ''Sir…'' the boy's voice was back, feeble words amongst all these horrible sounds. ''-the surgeon's coming as quickly as he can…'' No. Not like this… The smoke was appearing again and he thought he saw a figure watching him by the wall. He looked again and it was just the copse of trees, a strange illusion in the hot afternoon sun, before the haze cleared it away. A cold deafness descended upon the world along with it. ''Can you – can you hear me…?'' he managed. ''Yes, sir, I can hear you…'' Win, can you hear me? ''Will you tell – General Hancock that – General Armistead sends his regrets…'' Maybe for years, maybe forever… The words choked him. ''…will you – tell him – how very sorry I am…'' There was a pause where the boy just stared at him, eyes soft. Slowly, he lowered them and then bowed his head, removing his hat. ''Yes, sir…'' he said quietly, mournfully. ''I will tell him…I will tell him…'' Tom felt an immense heaviness as he walked away from General Armistead and the surgeon who had recently arrived to tend to him. He had seen grief on many levels, on so many fields, in the eyes of many men and women and sometimes even children in the towns they rode through, victims of the war without ever knowing anything about the battles until one raged outside their front door, but he couldn't erase the vision of the look of helpless despair on General Armistead's face when he had heard of General Hancock's fate. Will you tell him how very sorry I am…that General Armistead sends his regrets… The words swarmed in his mind. He wondered if this was something that a farm boy from a little town in Maine barely out of his teenage years should be getting involved in – wondered how it had ever come to this – but with every step he took, passing each man wounded or lying with the fire gone from their eyes forever on the ground, he couldn't help thinking of the two men. At his feet, he saw boys in blue who no doubt had friends on the other side yet it had always been that. The other side, like a deep chasm separated them. He had never realised…that it could be like this. And now he had been given this message. He had promised he would deliver it, promised it to a man who he could see was slowly slipping away. The thought made him bow his head, made his throat tighten. The image of his despair came again – he hasn't seen him since this War began, he could see that, he hasn't known…And now…He began to think of Lawrence, tried to imagine what it would be like to suddenly come face to face with him on either side of that stone wall…One in blue, one in grey. He couldn't see it, didn't want to. This message. It had made him a part of all this now and he suddenly felt a great loyalty to the two generals and…this. He would see this through. At his side, he noticed one of the young officers who had also been with General Armistead walk up and fall into step with him. ''Lieutenant…'' he said. Tom paused and turned to him, barely remembering to salute when he saw the insignia on the surprisingly clean uniform. ''My name is Captain Henry Bingham, and I am on General Hancock's staff. General Armistead is a dear friend of his. If you would like, I could deliver his message to the general.'' For a moment, Tom looked the man up and down. He appeared to be hardly any older than himself and had soft, kind eyes, must have also seen what Tom saw in General Armistead. He meant well, Tom could tell. But General Armistead had spoken to him directly. He had seen the despair and now felt this slow, deep heaviness. He had to deliver this message. ''No,'' he said. ''No, I feel like I should…General Armistead spoke to me…'' Bingham looked at him hard for a second or two and Tom felt like he was being scrutinised and judged. However, Bingham soon nodded. ''Yes,'' he said. ''Yes, of course. I understand. And I'm sure General Hancock will appreciate it too.'' There was another pause and the cries of the wounded started to rise up around them, horrid sounds from what sounded like miles around. Tom suddenly had the disorientating and unnerving feeling that he was standing right in the middle of it all. He looked up and saw the sun going down, a purple tone shading the sky. He wondered how such a bloody, terrible day could end with such a beautiful evening. '' – I would take you to the general now,'' continued Bingham, his eyes still on the ghastly field, '' – but, as you know, he is wounded badly. I would rather he gets to a hospital before…before he is told. But I can soon find you – what is your name?'' Tom returned to the captain, away from the colourful sky. ''My name is Lieutenant Tom Chamberlain, 20th Maine Regiment.'' Bingham nodded. ''Lieutenant, I will find you.'' A formal salute and Tom turned to walk away across the field, back to try and find Lawrence. Behind him, he heard Bingham mutter his surname, as if trying to remember something he'd forgotten. TBC My very first Gettysburg fanfic, which is terrible considering I first saw it almost over a year ago! :) But, after reading the Shaara trilogy, I just had to get back to it so here's my little tribute to a great film and a great set of books! Armistead and Hancock's story broke my heart. I wanted so badly for them to meet again and in my little story, maybe they will again? ;) I'd love to hear what you think so far![Chapter 2] Maybe Forever Chapter 2 He found General Hancock at the rear of the field, lying on a blood-soaked stretcher and impatiently waving away aides. As he approached, he slowed his steps and found himself taking off his hat at the sight of the general's damp, hastily wrapped bandage, tied with the desperation of stopping the steady flow spreading down his legs. There was still defiance in his eyes as Bingham knelt down at his side. ''Heaven above, Captain, I'm not dead!'' he snapped. ''Put your hat back on!'' Bingham heard the snarling pain in his voice, the frustration at lying on his back away from the front lines. He had said not two hours ago that there were times when a commander's life didn't matter, had refused evacuation. Bingham felt a deep admiration for him behind the sorrow he felt for the sight. He obeyed and put his hat back on. ''How are you, General?'' he asked. ''I've been worse,'' he grimaced in response and Bingham willed himself not to look down at the wound, tried not to remember watching the general pulling at that great, bloody nail and those splinters. I've been worse, he repeated in his mind and almost wanted to smile at Hancock's tenacity. ''We must get you to the hospital, General,'' he said simply and then, in reply to the fight still echoing somewhere, still pushing though Bingham had seen the devastation by those trees: ''Here is no place for you to be.'' ''I seem to be in the wrong places constantly today, Captain –'' He winced suddenly and Bingham reached to steady him as he tried to move. He glanced at the bandage then immediately regretted it, instead looked up to the sky, the beautiful evening, thought of how very curious it was. Such a terrible day. ''-or that's what people keep telling me.'' Bingham returned to Hancock, saw the last flickers in his eyes as he wrestled with staying awake. He motioned to some aides to assist him and he squeezed the general's hand as they rolled him onto his back again on the stretcher, until he realised his eyes were glazing over. It didn't matter how hard either of them tried, they couldn't stop the wound claiming him for a while. As they lifted him, he turned to look out again across the field and saw them, all the other wounded, too many to even begin to count. They were lying there, some still clutching weapons and flags fluttering in the breeze, twisted bodies of blue and grey, lying side by side. The tortured face of General Armistead suddenly came into his mind, the anguish at the news of General Hancock, the message he'd given the young lieutenant beside him. He'd heard much of Armistead from General Hancock, had listened to the stories, had seen the pain when he spoke of him but that plea, that final desperate attempt, that look, had spoken just as much as he had knelt there beside the man. He thought of telling Hancock, wondered if he was thinking of him as he lay there looking up at the orange sky, where he was, how he was and Bingham ached at keeping such precious information from him. But then he thought of the lieutenant – Chamberlain, Tom Chamberlain. He was a good man and he had promised deeply, honestly, truthfully to the general that he would deliver the message. And he would. So Bingham kept quiet, kept his head down as he helped the general to the hospital. There would be a time and he prayed it would be soon. He had to find a path through the fields of the dead and the wounded and the crying. He saw friends clinging to one another, some clinging to their last moments together, some thanking God they were both still breathing, some already too late and sitting there holding a still body in their arms. He wondered how many were brothers, how many were cousins, how many were fathers and sons. But all of them were lost, driven on now the fighting had ended by a grim, desperate search to find those they had lost sight of before through the gun-smoke and madness. Tom had to turn away as he saw one man standing amongst the wreckage and helplessly shouting for a man named John, eyes wide and so knowing as he looked around. He had to find Lawrence. He had to be here. He kept looking up but the image of him lying at his feet with all the others was insistent. No, he wasn't like that. This wasn't the end. It wasn't the end, not today. Tom found himself repeating that as he stumbled along, believing it less and less with every step. Lawrence, come on, where are you? He felt his name building in his throat, ready to yell it to the sky, but he heard again the pleading cry of John's name and he tried to force it back down. It came out instead as a trembling whisper. ''Lawrence…'' he said, heard the crack in his voice before he heard a feeble response below his feet. For a moment, he felt a burst of hope glow in his chest but then he looked and saw dark eyes, an old, weather-worn face. ''M-my name is Lawrence…'' the man said. There was a blood stain pooling and spreading below his blue jacket, just above his heart, but a sense of serenity in his eyes. ''Are you looking for me?'' Tom gulped and shook his head, couldn't say anything to him. Neither could he look back as he moved on, eyes back on the field before him. A purple mist was beginning to descend onto it and before long, it would be dark. He had to find him before then. He couldn't lose two in one day. Not my brother, anyone but my brother. His name was pushing at his lips again, about to break and scream, but then, across the hazy sea of bodies, standing on some island, there was a figure, looking back at him and staring. Just staring. He wanted to run, call out to him, but his legs were too weak and his voice lost. He instead began to stumble, his eyes never leaving him as if he would just disappear if he stopped. They met halfway, found each other silently and slowly, and Lawrence grasped his shoulders, looked long and hard at him, searching for something. Tom knew his knees were softening, could feel his throat tightening but he couldn't move, couldn't look anywhere but Lawrence. It seemed they stood like this forever, maybe he wanted to, didn't ever want to see a battle like the one he'd seen over the last three days again. As Lawrence's grip slowly became less firm, he suddenly felt faint, was there again at the top of this bloody field, shuddering of the weight of what he'd seen, what he may be about to see, but then he was being pulled closer and Lawrence's arms were around him, protection from all those memories. In the midst of all this madness, he hung on to his last shred of hope for dear life, trembling and trying to hold back the tears before they spilled over and he helplessly whispered Lawrence's name into his shoulder. Lawrence had always been there, the man who couldn't face shooting deer on the hillside back home but had, just the day before, ran and yelled down another hill now so far away from home into the face of the shocked Rebels, fearless as a lion sheltering his young. This is my brother , he had said to a defeated Reb officer when they stood before him after. My brother . The one who used to make up stories when the storms raged outside the house to send me to sleep . He clung to him then like those storms had returned, though knew that no wild Maine storm could be anywhere near as vicious or bone-chilling as that day in Gettysburg. It would be another beautiful summer back home right then in Maine, the freshest, sweetest, most beautiful place he could ever imagine and oh, he couldn't think of home. Couldn't think of anything anymore, when everything made his throat tighten and knees weaken. What was he doing here? The question must have slipped from his lips as he felt Lawrence shake his head against his shoulder. He expected a long, philosophical answer, was surprised when he said merely, simply, honestly: ''I don't know.'' I don't know. The only three words that had made any sense on this terrible day. I don't know. No. Nor do I. TBC Apologies for the wait! Thanks for all the favourites/alerts/comments so far! If this chapter seemed to stop very abruptly, as it seemed to kind of do when I was reading it back, apologies - the next chapter starts pretty much straight after where this leaves off.

He glanced up once at his younger sibling before returningnto the letter he was writing, the family would read of Gettysburg innthe papers, and he hoped the letter would reach them fast enough sonas to ease their minds. In the letter he expressed that both thensiblings were in fine health and had not come to any harm during thenlast engagement. Though, a voice in his head taunted him, playingnwith things he couldn't go back and change. The deeds had beenndone, and he'd live with the consequences for the rest of his life.nA few of those things had turned out all right, much to his relief.nOn that note, his eyes traveled back to the Lieutenant, and henimagined the heart stopping moments on Round Top. Hencould very well be in a hospital because of you, or in a shallowngrave. Henshook himself mentally, \"Why don't you sit down Tom?\" He knewnthe boy wouldn't do so unless instructed to, or invited. Therenwas something else the army had done. Only last year he was swattingnthe younger man's shoulder with a newspaper to get him away fromnhis desk at Bowdoin. The memory made him smile slightly, gaze distantnas he watched movement through the tent opening. He'd left thenroom, for what he couldn't remember for the life of him, but he'dnreturned to find a very cheeky and smug looking Thomas Chamberlainnsitting behind his work space. Much to the delight of the students innthe room. Hencouldn't even remember why Tom had been there, maybe there hadn'tnbeen a reason. Maybe he'd just wanted to cause the older man grief.nChamberlain had never really asked. Though, he'd put up a front tonthe class, the serious teacher and role model he should be, thenincident had amused him. None of the other siblings would dream ofndoing such. Yet there was Tom, happy as a little clam sitting therenin a professor's chair. That'snwhen the deadly force of the newspaper came into play. Itnwas the youngest brother's youth and sense of adventure that hadnmade the months easier for Chamberlain. He was afraid the events bothnof them lived through would rip that from Tom, that one day he'dnlook into blue eyes like his own and see nothing. Hisnconversation with Kilrain suddenly came back to him, if there was onenthing he ever hoped to learn from the Irishman it would have to benfrom that conversation. His own words echoed in his mind. Andivine spark, as my mother used to call it. Hisnhead shot up to look at the Lieutenant, that's why he'd nevernreally reprimanded Thomas for what he'd done in that class room.nWhy he kept him close, when he should be pushing him away. Tom'snenergy was an embodiment of that spark. Henstood quickly, which startled the younger man so that he stood asnwell. Grabbing his brother's shoulders roughly, Chamberlain turnednin a way that light from the outside would fall onto the juniornofficer. Tom stood rigid, didn't understand what Chamberlain wasndoing at all, and only looked back at him with a slightly confusedninterest. ThenColonel studied him for a long moment, took in every detail. ThenLieutenant was leaning away from him, stiff as a board. The uniformnwasn't immaculate, but it was much more presentable than even somenof the Generals Chamberlain had seen in the past seventy two hours.nHe was pale from lack of sleep, circles under his eyes contrastingnheavily with his complexion. The kepi was still not on straight, hendoubted it ever would be. Finally he gauged the boy's expression,ntired, that was to be expected but he was looking for something else. Whennlooking into one's eyes, there is literally a spark of lightnstaring back at you. The way an eye catches light shows you thenessence behind. A single candle can reflect a thousand fold in liveneyes, the spirit shining and lighting up the darkness around him,nwith a brilliance like no other. For others, the brightest of daysncan not ignite that ember, and while that person lives, they arendead, with no depth or meaning to that existence. Chamberlainnfeared for that spark, he feared one day he would no longer see it.nIn himself, in Tom, in any of them. So he searched his brother'sneyes, the younger man holding his gaze but still unsure of thenColonel's reasoning in all this. Henwas about to say something when Chamberlain found what he was lookingnfor. Though the Lieutenant was exhausted on most accounts, he'dnsnapped to attention when Chamberlain had felt the need to inspectnhim. Sunlight fell through the tent flaps, hitting the Colonel'sntin cup, and then bouncing up into the young officer's countenance.nThough he was no longer the cheeky troublemaker, Chamberlain couldnsee it lying dormant. Tom took his job seriously, was most likely innshock over the last days events, but the Colonel could see it. Hencould see the impetuous youth, waiting for the Lieutenant to digestnwhat had taken place there in Gettysburg. It would return, but not innsuch an inappropriate time. They were grieving, but Chamberlain tookncomfort in what he'd seen. Beforenparting, he pulled the younger man towards him and embraced himntightly. Standing back once more he let his arms fall to his sidesnand smiled slightly at his brother's expression. Tomnraised a brow, \"Lawrence, next time you go rhetorical collegenprofessor on me, let me know in advance.\" Ahh,nthere was that impetuous speech. Anteasing gleam showing through the solemn expression. \"Rhetoricalncollege professor?\" Tomnblinked a few times. \"You get this look-\" He gestured helplessly,n\"When you think about certain things.\" \"Likenon the hill-\" The Lieutenant looked up, that gleam recedingnslightly, which only added to Chamberlain's interest. It was like annew challenge, judge his brother's mood by gauging his eyes. Henrealized what Tom had said, the conversation taking a turn he wasn'tnsure he was ready to take. \"Indidn't realize you were so perceptive Tom.\" ThenLieutenant met his gaze seriously, \"I pay attention.\" Henraised a hand slowly, resting it on the younger man's shoulder. Itnwas hard to think that Tom was no longer the eighteen year old thatngave him a hard time on their hunting expeditions. They'd both seennthings that would change their views of the world and fellow mennforever. Asnlong as he saw that spark, he knew everything would be alright. Henknew, though, that when the war ended, there wouldn't be a fullnreturn to what they'd been before. If nothing else, he hoped theyndid see this war to the end. He couldn't imagine any other outcome,nand he'd watch, he'd continue to watch out for the younger man.nHe pushed back any taunting thoughts at that, he didn't feel likengrappling with his own conscience at the moment. What's done isndone, and he decided at that moment that for the rest of the war he'dnbe more careful. He only hoped in the heat of battle he wouldnremember that vow. Becausenhe couldn't imagine seeing that spark die.[Chapter 2] AuthornNote: I decided to add one more chapter because it was requested ofnme in such a nice way. I hope it doesn't disappoint. ----- ThomasnChamberlain had spent much of the day alone, he feared it was slowlyndriving him mad. He wasn't ready to really talk about what had justnhappened to them, but he needed another human presence. He needednsomething to tie him to the living world and push away the imagesnthat lingered in his mind's eye. He'd left his own quartersnwithout a thought as to where he should go, but had found himselfnstanding in front of the Colonel's tent. When did that happen? Henglanced down the rows of tents, couldn't remember the ground hencovered to get there. It worried him slightly. Maybe he was goingnmad. Henwas called in before even announcing he was there, that didn'tnreally surprise him. Lawrence always seemed to know what was goingnon, and if he didn't, well, he was very skilled at hiding it. Tomnthought to himself. Henducked into the canvas enclosure, met eyes once with the Colonelnbefore the man returned to whatever he was working on. Tom watchednhim a moment with half lidded eyes, blinking a few times beforenstraightening his position and clasping his hands behind his back.nTheir personal relationship was informal, but in the same breath,nthis was a superior officer's tent. The protocol of the militaryncame first. He turned and looked out of their shelter, his back tonhis brother. When the older man's voice broke the silence of thentent, he was once again, not surprised. Every time he came to thentent it was the same thing. Thoughnthis time, he hadn't been asked to sit down, he'd been told to.nHe'd heard it enough times in his life to recognize the tone hisnbrother had just used. It was formed as a question, but there was annunderlying, weary edge that left no room for arguments. Looking toneither side of the tent, Tom hesitated, there was only a singlenwooden chair. One chair he'd only ever seen one person use. Buster. Hencast a glance back at Chamberlain. Surely Lawrence didn't realizenwhat he'd just told the Lieutenant to do? If Lawrence knew the onlynavailable place belonged to Buster, he wouldn't have suggested itnthen. Not after a single day of receiving the news of the Irishman'sndeath. When the Colonel didn't look back at him he turned backntowards the chair, swallowed heavily and did as he was told. That'snwhat soldiers did, when it was all said and done. Thenyounger Chamberlain sat stiffly, back rigid. He didn't like thenthought of taking the deceased man's favorite spot. It made thenhorrible events of the previous days real, that there was never againngoing to be a witty smile in that chair when he entered the tent. Tomnclosed his eyes, the last few horrifying days catching up with him.nHe was exhausted, yet couldn't get any rest. He'd stared at thenceiling of his tent for hours the night before, barely drifting intonthe darkness of sleep when the blare of a bugle had startled him backninto the land of the living. Maybe the heat had something to do withnthat, he mused. He shook his head at that thought, that was onlynlying to yourself. He knew why he couldn't sleep, he just couldn'tnadmit it to himself. Thenwool uniform seemed to cling to him, as if it had shrunk recently. Henrolled his shoulders in an attempt to loosen the cramped and tightnmuscles, issued a silent sigh when his efforts failed. He'd beennrunning on pure adrenaline for nigh on a week. In the excitement ofnbattle, he'd been wound up to such an extent that he could only bencompared to a tightly coiled spring. At any moment he'd felt likenhe could snap. The final battle had been hard, yes, but his mindndwelled more on the hill. The image of a gun leveled on him flashednbehind his eyes and he shivered, turned his head slightly to facenaway from Chamberlain, who seemed lost in his own thoughts. Movementnfrom the edge of his vision caused him to spring up, he knew it wasnthe Colonel, but in the back of his mind he was still on alert of anynsign of the enemy. To jump into action at a moments notice and benready to relay orders, watch his brother's back, and keep himselfnalive. Itnwas a gross understatement to say he was surprised when the Colonelngrabbed him by the uniform and dragged him across the tent. He leanednaway from the physical contact, not understanding what was goingnthrough the older man's head. His brows nearly met his hairline,nthe expression on the older man's face was oddly disconcerting. Henglanced to the side, uncomfortable of being scrutinized. ThenColonel's intense study of him made Tom uncomfortable. Thenlook in Chamberlain's eyes had scared him, the older man was thenone the regiment looked to. He was stoic, able to think in times ofncrisis. He'd proven that. What Tom saw now was an emotion he hadnnever expected to see. Reflecting in the eyes of the Colonel of then20thnMaine, was fear. What upset Tom more was that, that fear was directedntowards him, it was during this odd inspection that the emotion hadnentered the man's eyes. Henforced his gaze back towards the older man, tried to form a questionnwhen he was once again caught off guard. He was suddenly pulled intona crushing embrace. Despite the pull in sore muscles, he returned thenembrace ten fold and was reluctant to step back when Chamberlainnreleased him. Studying the man's eyes a moment, he was relieved tonsee them clear of anxiety. Tom wasn't sure of the cause of it tonbegin with, but to see it was no longer present eased his mindnsomewhat. Henmade some offhand comment so as to lighten the mood, but even to himnhis voice didn't quite have the same tone he used when teasing thenolder man. A single statement from his brother, though, caused him tonstop short and look up. \" Indidn't realize you were so perceptive Tom.\" Henwas unused to praise. Yes, he'd been promoted a few times, but thatnwas nothing special. The man before him was not one to congratulatensmall deeds. To receive a word of recognition from the Colonel wasnsomething to take pride in. Shrugging his shoulders slightly, hentried to brush it aside. Though, internally, there was an energynbuilding again. Repairing itself, after the last days events had tornnit away. Unknownnto either officer. The small discussion had started the healingnprocess. Each had done or said something that significantly raisednthe spirits of the other. The war wasn't over. Neither man knewnwhen it would end, but from now on they would both hold momentsntogether more dear. Becausenafter the last three days, there was no knowing what moment would benyour last.

I'm not that bad!\" \"And I'm possessive it isn't nice. You've heard me say that smoking was my only vice.\" Lonny nodded. \"But now it isn't true. Now everything is new.\" Dennis stepped forward and placed his hands on Lonny's cheeks, \"And all I've learned, was overturned. I beg of you-\" Constance burst through the doors of the Bourbon in a rage and glared at Stacee. \"Don't go wasting your emotions. Lay all your love on me! Don't go sharing your devotions.\" \"Lay all your love on me.\" Dennis interrupted. \"It was like shooting a sitting duck.\" Lonny admitted, \"A little small talk a smile and baby I was stuck.\" Dennis smirked, \"I still don't know what you've done to me. A man should never fall so easily.\" \"I feel a kind of fear, when I don't have you near.\" Lonny slipped away from Dennis' hands and walked behind him, \"Un-satisfied, I skip my pride.\" \"I beg you dear!\" Constance yelled, \"Don't go wasting your emotions, lay all your love on me. Don't go sharing your devotions. Lay all your love on me.\" The groupies left, leaving Stacee standing before Constance alone. \"I've had a few little love affairs. They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce.\" Stacee insisted. \"I used to think I was sensible. It makes the truth even more incomprehensible!\" Constance yelled angrily. \"Everything is new. But everything is you.\" Stacee grabbed Constance's hands, \"All I've learned, was overturned. What can I do?\" \"Don't go wasting your emotions. Lay all your love on me!\" Constance told him, dropping his hands and walking away. \"Don't go sharing your devotions. Lay all your love on me.\" Dennis said as he turned and grabbed Lonny by the back of his suspenders. Lonny grinned. Dennis was adorable when he was jealous. \"Don't go wasting your emotions. Lay all your love on me.\"[Chapter 3] The third instalment. Slightly AU since Constance and Stacee aren't together but Constance is at the Bourbon room. Friend of Sherrie's? I dunno. You decide. Dennis frowned. He was sitting at the desk in the office, sorting through taxes. \"Alright Den?\" Lonny asked as he sat down on the couch. \"More taxes.\" \"Oh. Well, we can afford it. Can't we?\" \"Yeah. But I won't have any money left over.\" Constance stood in the Bourbon with Sherrie. \"I don't have enough money for anything anymore.\" Constance complained, \"This job doesn't pay as well as it used to.\" Dennis buried his face in his hands, \"I work all night, I work all day. I pay the bills I have to pay.\" \"Ain't it sad?\" Lonny said with a smile. \"And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me.\" \"That's too bad.\" Lonny replied. \"So what are you gonna do about this money problem?\" Sherrie asked Constance. \"In my dreams, I have a plan. If I got me a wealthy man, I wouldn't have to work at all I'd fool around and have a ball.\" Constance replied dreamily. \"Money, money, money. Must be funny, in a rich man's world.\" Dennis muttered as he got up from the desk. \"Money, money, money. Always sunny, in a rich man's world.\" Constance said with a sigh. \"All the things I could do…\" \"If I had a little money!\" Constance said sadly, \"It's a rich man's world.\" \"A man like that is hard to find.\" Sherrie pointed out. \"But I can't get him off my mind!\" Constance yelled. \"And if he happens to be free?\" Sherrie questioned. \"Oh. I guess he wouldn't fancy me.\" Constance said sadly. \"I must leave, I have to go, to Las Vegas, or Monaco.\" Dennis decided as he left the office. \"Can I come?\" Lonny asked. \"I'll win a fortune in a game.\" \"Our lives would never be the same!\" Lonny said excitedly. \"Money, money, money. Must be funny, in a rich man's world.\" \"Money, money, money. Always sunny, in a rich man's world.\" \"All the things we could do!\" Lonny said happily, \"If we had a little money.\" \"It's a rich man's world.\" Dennis responded. Stacee walked through the door of the Bourbon and saw Constance. Sherrie dropped the tray she was holding and stared. Constance stood there in dis belief. \"Um, uh…\" She swallowed nervously. \"I'm Stacee.\" Stacee said softly. \"C-Constance.\" \"Constance? Could you do me a favour?\" \"A-Anything.\" \"Could you meet me in my dressing room?\" \"S-sure…\"[Chapter 4] The fourth instalment! Should I do a dancing queen chapter? Lonny's big solo… :D Constance turned and sat on the edge of the stage. She'd just had a fight with Stacee. He'd gone out with a couple of band mates to calm down, and Constance was left alone in the Bourbon. Dennis sat down next to her, barely acknowledging her presence. He clearly had something on his mind, but Constance didn't ask what. She had her own problems. Lonny ran over and sat down between them, the usual bundle of energy. \"What are we talking about?\" Dennis grunted, Constance stayed silent. \"Come on. What's up?\" \"Which one of us are you asking?\" Constance questioned. \"Both of you.\" \"Stacee and I had a fight.\" Lonny frowned, \"Are you ok?\" Constance shook her head, \"I don't think it's the fixable kind of fight.\" \"Oh.\" \"I just keep thinking about all the things I should have said. And I keep thinking about all we've been through. What's your problem Dennis?\" She asked half-heartedly. \"My ex-wife called.\" \"Oh.\" Lonny said stiffly, \"What does she want? More money?\" Dennis shook his head, \"I'm actually not sure what she wanted. She was just reminiscing. It got me thinking.\" \"About?\" Lonny asked nervously. \"I can still recall, our last summer. I still see it all.\" \"The walks along the Seine.\" Constance said dreamily. \"Laughing in the rain.\" Dennis added, \"Our last summer. Memories that remain.\" Lonny smiled. He loved it when Denis reminisced. He got a look about him that Lonny adored. \"We made our way along the river and we sat down in the grass, by the Eiffel tower.\" Constance remembered fondly. \"Was this when you two went to France?\" Lonny asked. Constance nodded. \"I was so happy we had met.\" She muttered. \"It was the age of no regrets.\" Dennis said thoughtfully, \"Oh yes. Those crazy years that was the time, of the Flower-Power.\" \"But underneath, we had a fear of flying.\" Constance cringed, thinking of that god awful plane trip. \"Of growing old. A fear of slowly dying.\" Dennis frowned, \"We took a chance. Like we were dancing our last dance.\" \"I can still recall, our last summer. I still see it all. In the tourist jam, round' the Notre Dame.\" \"Our last summer, walking hand in hand.\" Dennis smiled and took Lonny's hand in his. \"Paris restaurants, our last summer, morning croissants.\" \"Living for the day, worries far away. Our last Summer. We could laugh and play.\" \"And now you're working in a club. The business man, the Arsenal fan, and your name is Dennis.\" Lonny said with a smile. \"How dull it seems.\" Dennis replied glumly. \"Yet you're the hero of my dreams.\" Lonny insisted. \"I can still recall, our last summer. I still see it all. In the tourist jam, round' the Notre Dame.\" \"Our last summer, walking hand in hand.\" \"I can still recall, our last summer. I still see it all. Walks along the Seine.\" \"Laughing in the rain.\" \"Our last summer. Memories that remain.\"[Chapter 5] The others haven't been entirely Mama Mia-esque, but this one is. \"Constance!\" Sherrie yelled, \"You'll never guess what I found.\" Sherrie had been rummaging through some of the boxes in the office, and had come across something she didn't even know existed. \"What is it?\" Constance asked. She was sitting at the bar watching Arsenal practise for tonight's gig. \"Lonny's journal!\" Sherrie said excitedly, she went to open it, but Constance stopped her. \"You can't read that! It's probably private!\" \"Come on, I'm curious!\" Constance sighed and allowed her to open the book. \"This isn't right.\" Constance replied, \"I feel guilty already.\" \"Honey, honey, how he thrills me. Ah-huh. Honey, honey.\" \"That's what it says?\" \"Honey, honey. Nearly kills me. Ah-huh. Honey, honey.\" \"Who's he talking about?\" Constance asked. Sherrie shrugged and turned the page, \"I heard about him before, I wanted to know some more. Now I know what they mean, he's a love machine! Oh he makes me dizzy!\" Sherrie laughed, \"I don't believe this! Honey, honey. Let me feel it,ah-huh. Honey, honey.\" \"Oh dear god.\" Constance cringed. \"Honey, honey. Don't conceal it. Ah-huh. Honey, honey.\" \"We should really stop reading this.\" \"The way that you kiss goodnight, the way that you hold me tight. I feel like I wanna sing, when you do your, THING!\" They both burst out laughing. \"I can't believe this! You don't think he's talking about Dennis do you?\" \"Honey, honey, touch me baby. Ah-huh. Honey, honey. Honey, honey, hold me baby, Ah-huh. Honey, honey. You look like a movie star, but I know just who you are. And honey to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast!\" \"Sherrie, we need to stop reading this. Please.\" \"Honey, honey, how you thrill me. Ah-huh. Honey, honey. Honey, honey, nearly kills me. Ah-huh. Honey, honey. I heard about you before. I wanted to know some more. Now I know what they mean, he's a love machine.\" \"It's actually pretty good. He should be a songwriter.\" \"There's more.\" \"Do I wanna hear it?\" \"Dear god, I've really fallen for him. Hard. He's just too bloody perfect. I never thought I'd be so lucky. Jesus Christ, I'm in love with Dennis Dupree. And he's in love with me. Somebody up there, down there, wherever, likes me.\" Sherrie smiled. \"Dennis! Have you seen my jour- I mean, my important book with all the concert dates in it?\" Lonny called from somewhere in the office. \"Haven't seen it.\" Dennis replied. \"Sherrie, when you were cleaning up, did you come across a black note book with my name on it?\" \"Yeah!\" \"Where did you put it?\" \"I'm holding it now!\" Lonny bolted down the stairs and snatched the book out of Sherrie's hands. \"What are you doing?! That's private! Did you read any of it?\" Sherrie shrugged. \"A couple of pages. Its good.\" \"Its personal!\" \"Whatever you say, honey.\" Lonny turned bright red and stormed off towards the office. Geez. This one nearly killed me! I dunno if Lonny would actually keep a diary/journal/song writing book. I'd love to read some of it… ","Summary":" Why?

Suddenlynhad the urge to write a Wild Child fanfic so here I am lols! Hopenyou enjoy! Readnand review! =] Summaryn– The term has finished and Poppy has to say goodbye to Freddie,nalthough she will be seeing him sooner than she thinks. So she headsnback to LA with her girls in tow. The holidays are sure to be wildnand the return to school even wilder! MmmmnI want my own Freddie, sadly I have lived in England my whole lifenand still haven't found one =[ hehe lolls anyways enjoy! I sat onnmy bed in the familiar dorm room. Okay sure it was cramped, badlyndecorated and sometimes had a funny smell for no reason, but it hadnbecome my home and even for the 6 weeks I would be away I would missnit. The onlyngood thing is that the girls are coming to stay over mine for 3 ofnthose weeks, maybe a little longer with a bit of persuasion on thenparent front. It was hard at first and their parents even rang up MrsnKingsley but apparently she said I was a reliable polite young girl.nWell there's a first for everything! Anyway they eventually agreednand dad and Kate's mum seemed to hit it off big time! How coolnwould it be if they got together? If only I could get rid of dad'snhideous girlfriend Rosemary. But don't worry for once I'm goingnto let nature take its course and sit back to see what happens. How'snthat for growing up! Anyway nownI have to do the worst part…Saying goodbye. I never have been goodnwith goodbyes whether it being for forever or just a month or two.nMaybe its just change I don't like but hey, there's no way I'mnlosing contact with Freddie during the summer holidays. That's onenthing losing mum taught me, you only live once so make sure you usenevery moment to show people you care about them because you nevernknow when you might lose them. I know it's daft but its true andnsince being at Abbey Mount I feel closer to mum than I ever havensince she died. I stood upnand looked at myself in the mirror. I was wearing a gorgeous babynpink Dior outfit with matching heels and of course accessories. I maynhave changed but that don't mean I have to wear frilly grandmanjumpers! I smilednat the memory of that dreadful jumper I had to wear when we wentnshopping although I think I pulled it off quite well considering. I quicklyngrabbed my handbag from my bed and took one last look at the nownempty dorm room. I'm notngoing to be gone forever I remind myself. And withnthat I left smiling at the memories. The funny thing is I don'tnregret anything; I came up with a list in bed last night whilst thengirls were asleep. UsingnFreddie to get out of Abbey Mount – If I hadn't I wouldn'tnhave gotten to know him and I probably would have been kicked outnbefore I could discover how much I actually love it here. Duh! Thenfire – I would never have found out what a biatch Harriet was! Atnleast she is gone now. Jumpingnin the sea with dads girlfriend's clothes – I would never havenmet the best friends in the world…and Freddie! But maybe Inshouldn't pull that stunt again! Being the real me – None of this would have happened if I didn'tnlet myself become…well me. Not the vain self obsessed me but thentrue me. Random Inknow but I wanted to prove that every cloud has a silver lining, asnmy mum used to always say. I headednoutside to where everyone was meeting their parents and sayingngoodbye and instead of joining them I headed to one of the gardensn(this place has tons!) and saw Freddie sitting on the bench I hadnplanned to meet him at. His blonde hair lolled about almost messy butnstill tidy and his eyes shone at me as he saw me. He still looked asngood as ever and I found myself wanting to drool until I forcednmyself to play it cool. It wasnstill early days with us but I do like him a lot, more than anyone Inhave before and I am going to miss him a hell of a lot. He gavenhis signature half smile as he saw me approach and I couldn't helpnbut smile back as I felt a quiver down my spine. \"Hey.\"nHe said as I sat beside him. \"Hey,\"nI replied. It was awkward as we still hadn't gotten to know eachnother as much as we would have liked to and neither of us was readynto say goodbye. Both of us stayed silent and he moved his hand so itnwas on top of mine and I felt tears starting to prick at the back ofnmy eyes. I did try my hardest to keep them in but it didn't worknand a tear slowly slid down my cheek. \"Comenhere,\" He said embracing me in a hug. \"Don't cry trouble.\" That wasneasy for him to say. I finally feel like my whole life is finally onntrack and now I have to let it all go. \"Younhaven't gotten rid of me that easy and we will be back in 6 weeks,\"nHe told me soothingly and gently rubbing my back. I have tonadmit it did help a bit especially when he kissed the top of my head.nI mean come on how sweet can a guy be! Especially one that isn'tngay anyways. \"Justndon't forget me,\" I said sitting up and drying my eyes with antissue from my bag. Thank god for waterproof mascara! \"Now howncould I forget you? Wild child,\" He said murmuring the last bit. Henslowly tilted his head and I tilted mine the opposite way to meet himnas he gently kissed my lips. \"I bestngo my dad and the others will be waiting,\" I told him sadly. \"Okay,nsee you soon,\" He said. I did notice he was not actually sayingngoodbye. \"See younsoon too,\" I replied smiling and giving him one more kiss beforengetting up and heading to find the others. When I gotnto the front of the school everyone seemed to mostly still be therensaying goodbye to each other. I was practically pounced on byneveryone giving me hugs and saying tearful goodbyes. Eventually itnstarted to die down and I managed to get to the others. \"This isnit girls, lets hope L.A. is prepared for us!\" I said and all of usndid our little dance. I couldn't help but laugh at how much of anbunch of dorks we must have looked but I didn't care. Soon wenheaded to the car where my dad and the driver were waiting by anlimousine. He pulled me straight into a big hug and I couldn't helpnbut smile. We had never been very close before but now we definitelynare. There wasna cough behind us and we turned to see the headmistress Mrs Kingsley. \"I wouldnlike to congratulate you Mr Moore. Your daughter is very bright and Inknow she has a bright future ahead of her,\" She told my dadnsmiling. I smilednand hugged her. Even though I couldn't see her face I knew she wasnshocked and unsure of what to do, but she soon patted my back stifflynand I let go trying not to laugh. \"Thanknyou again Mrs Kingsley,\" Her dad said also smiling. \"Byengirls I hope you have a good break and don't cause too muchntrouble,\" she said smiling slightly. \"Bye MrsnKingsley!\" We chorused. \"Oh andnthanks for everything Mrs Kingsley. I couldn't have done it withoutnyou,\" I told her and it was damn true. She smilednat us before leaving and with that we all piled in the back of thenlimo, daddy included. \"Thisncalls for a celebration!\" Daddy said to us opening the built inncooler inside the limo. He pullednout a bottle of champagne and then gave us all a glass before pouringnus all some. \"To newnbeginnings,\" He said holding his glass in the air once it had allnbeen poured. \"To newnbeginnings,\" We replied in unison. Well nearly in unison. Whilst thengirlies were chatting my dad pulled me to the side (yeh it's a bignlimo!) to talk to him. \"Poppy Injust want to say how proud I am of you,\" He said looking her in theneyes. \"And your mother would have been so proud of you, you seemnmore and more like her everyday now.\" I smilednand felt the tears prick in the back of my eyes but this time Inmanaged to keep them at bay. \"Thanksndaddy. I love you.\" \"I lovenyou to sweetheart. Now go have fun with your friends,\" He replied. \"Okayngirls Malibu moment!\" I said. \"Who are we?!\" We allnbundled together with champagne glasses held high as the cameranflashed and then clicked to show it had taken the photo. The restnof the journey to the airport was spent with laughter as we sharednmemories and just generally pissed about, I got some really goodnpictures of us too. When wenarrived at the airport the girls immediately headed for check in. \"Wherendo you think your going?\" I asked them with a cheeky smile on mynface. \"Duh, toncheck in!\" Drippy said giving me a funny look. \"Wendon't have to do that!\" I replied smiling and dragged dad and thenguys through the airport. After wengot through security someone was waiting to take our bags as normalnand then we headed towards one of the doors heading outside, on thendoor was V.I.P only. The girlsnlooked at each other and then followed me though the doors with bigngrins on their faces. Then standing in front of us was daddy'snprivate plane. \"Wow!\"nThey said in shock. \"Comenon!\" I said grabbing Kate's and Josie's hands who then grabbednboth the others. We ran to the plane and up the stairs screaming inndelight. I had never had friends like these before and I'm notnplanning on ever losing them. Inside itnhas 8 seats with plenty of room. There is red velvet everywhere andnpeople whose job it is to get you basically whatever you want. I havenonly been on the plane a few times but its still like the first timenevery time I go on it. I love it. We all satnin our seats and settled down when eventually my dad got on thenplane, he smiled at us and I knew he could tell how much happier I amnnow. Only having Freddie here could this get any better. \"I'mngoing to ride upfront so behave girls,\" He said smiling and he leftnus to it. \"Why isnyour dad going to the front?\" Kiki asked. \"Oh henwill probably fly it some of the way. He got his license last year,\"nI told them. Theynlooked so happy, who knows what would have happened to me if they hadnstill hated me. Well actually I would have been kicked out simple as.nThank god for friends! As we tooknoff Drippy grabbed the seat in fear, she obviously didn't likenflying I thought but as soon as take off was complete she calmed downnand actually seemed to be enjoying herself. My phonenbleeped in my handbag and I pulled it out. I smiled when I saw who itnwas. HeynTrouble Justnwant to say I miss you already and I can't wait to see you again.nThese last few days have been amazing! Ring me when you land. F xx My heartnwas pounding with excitement and happiness that everything seemed tonfade out for a moment and I knew I was grinning like a Cheshire cat. \"Ooohnit's lover boy!\" Drippy shouted out to the others bringing me outnof my day dream. \"Hey!\"nI said blushing. That's one problem with these guys now. They knownme too well! One look and I swear they instantly know what I'mnthinking. \"Freddienand poppy sitting in a tree…\" Josie started and soon the othersnwere belting it out. I thoughtnabout sitting there ignoring them like an adult but hey I aint nonadult! Instead Ingrabbed one of the pillows supplied on the plane and started hittingnthem with it. Soon it was a full on all on all pillow fight to thendeath. I was soon laughing so hard my eyes were watering and Inglanced at the mess we had made. There were feathers everywhere andnthey were still floating down from the sky. Then when I looked at thengirls I laughed even harder to see feathers sticking out their hairnand all over their cloths! \"MissnMoore?\" A voice spoke. Shit I'm gunna be in trouble I thought. \"Yes,\"nI said as silence filled the plane. \"I haveneleven o'clock wagon wheels,\" The air hostess spoke setting downna tray before leaving us and well our mess behind. \"OmgawdnI think I'm in love with you Poppy Moore,\" Drippy said to me withna look of astonishment on her face. I had madensure that at 11 o'clock we were to be brought tons of wagon wheelsnand other sugary goodness. Yeh I have finished with the diet andnpicky eating. From now on I'm going to eat what I want when I want! I decidednto quickly text Freddie back whilst the others were preoccupied withnthe goodies that had been sent. HeynFreddie I missnyou too, I am having a great time with the girls but I wish you werenhere too. I have to turn my phone of now cus I'm not even supposednto have it on but I will ring you the moment I can get alone. Yehnthese last few days have been perfect! Troublenx I pressednsend and then returned to the munchfest at hand. The rest of thenjourney was filled with us watching films, randomly belting out songsnand just generally having a laugh. And even when dad stepped out ofnthe front of the plane and saw the mess we had made he just chucklednand sat down to wait until the plane landed. I know weird aint it? Soon I andnthe girls stepped onto the pavement and into the burning rays of thensun. We lookednup at the clear blue skies and knew that this was only the beginningnof the adventures to come. Nextntime – what mischief will the girls get into in Malibu? Will shensee Freddie sooner than she thinks? How will meeting Rosemary againnaffect her? And what will happen with Ruby and Roddy? Tune in! Wellnthat's it for this chapter. I don't think it's too bad innlength either =] 2414 words! Not including the author's notes. Sonhow do you think it did as a first chapter? AlsonI know there are probably tons of mistakes but it's late and Inhaven't checked through it. I have millions of ideas for this andnhopefully it will be like at least 30 chapters if I have time. I'llnwarn you now I'm not the fastest at updating cus I have quite a fewnstories going but if you keep reviewing and nagging me they will benup sooner lolls! Anynof you fellow Brits out there? lols AnywaynI really hope you enjoyed it and I should have another chapter upnnext week. Natznxx[Chapter 2] Heynchapter 2 at the ready! Recapn(in case you can't remember the previous chapter) – Poppy had tonsay her goodbye to Freddie although she didn't want to. Then shenand the girls hit the road to Malibu! Anywaysnread and review! Afternleaving the airport we caught a cab to go back home. When the girlsngave me a funny look I explained to them that I wanted them to getnthe real LA experience and not the one hidden by the tinted limousinenwindows. \"Are younready girls?!\" I said as we were turning the corner to my house. I watchednas they stared out of the window excited and eager to see where theynwould be staying for the next 3 weeks. Seconds later we pulled upnoutside the house. \"Wow!\"nThat was all I got from the girls as they stared at the house. It feelsngood to be home and I can't wait to see Molly again. I was onlynable to talk to her a couple of times at weekends and I have missednher a hell of a lot. Theynreminded me of when I first moved there quite a long time ago, I feltnlike a princess running around all the rooms deciding which one wouldnbe mine and then ever so sweetly Molly chose the room opposite mineneven though it was the smallest. We got outnof the cab and grabbed our luggage. \"Come onngirls there's lots to do!\" I told them and headed to the housendragging my luggage behind me. They quickly followed and I grinnednwith excitement and the things I had planned. I got tonthe door and was about to knock when it swung open and Molly bundledninto me screaming \"Poppy your home! I missed you.\" I laughednand dropped my luggage to wrap her in a bear hug. \"I havenmissed you so much Molster, even cutting your crusts every morningneven if I'm already late,\" I let go of her and took a step backnto look at her properly. \"Still the same little sis I left behind,njust a bit taller.\" I thennrealised the girls were waiting behind me. \"Ohnguys, this is my little sister Molly,\" I told them and they allnsaid hi to her. \"And Molly this is Kiki, Josie, Drippy and Kate.\" I pointednthem out to her as I went through their names. \"As longnas there not like Ruby, she was a horrible cow,\" She said screwingnher nose. \"Nonthey're nothing like Ruby, you'll love them and don't say stuffnlike that,\" I told her. \"Youndo!\" She said back. \"I'mnolder though,\" I said smiling. \"Okay Inguess you guys are alright then,\" Molly eventually turned and saidnto the girls. I don'tnknow when Molly became so overprotective. Maybe she always has beennand I just haven't noticed or have just been too caught up innmyself to notice. She did always say that Ruby was a lousy friend atnany rate. Cough. I turnednaround and speak of the devil Ruby was standing there. I watched asnher eyes travelled over me and then the girls. \"Poppy…Sweetie.nI'm so glad you're home. What are you doing with these skankynlosers? Come on I know some great shoes you could buy and I couldnborrow?\" She said. I was nearly fuming. How dare she insult mynfriends like that? Okayndeep breath I can't go totally skitzo on her arse I thought tonmyself. \"Firstnthings first, they are not skanky losers, you are. And they arenbetter friends than you could ever dream of being you were nicer tonmy shoes than you were to me. So I think you should leave before Inopen a can of whoop ass on your last season prada boots.\" I saidnhoping she would get the picture. Even looking at her now I don'tnknow how she was my best friend. But itsnokay cus now instead of one shit friend I have four amazing ones.nAmazing how life works out hey? \"You'llnregret this Poppy Moore,\" She said flicking her hair and stormingnoff. Nope Indefinitely and positively wont I thought to myself. \"Come onnlets chuck our stuff upstairs and then we are going out!\" I toldnthem. We slowlynmade our way upstairs due to the fact we were lugging our suitcasesnup and the girls had wanted to stop ever 5 seconds to check out everynlittle detail of the house. When weneventually go to my room I sighed with relief and collapsed on thenbed panting, soon I was joined by the girls until we caught ournbreath. \"I lovenyour room poppy, it's like a princess's,\" Kate said admiringly. \"Nownall she needs is her prince charming a.k.a. Freddster to whisk hernaway and…\" Drippy started. \"JennifernLogan if you say one more word this pillow will make contact withnyour head, and not in a nice way!\" I threatened jokingly to drippynusing her full name. \"OoohnI'm so scared!\" She said pulling a face and laughing. \"That'snit!\" Soon a major pillow fight started and the winner being Kiki innthe end. She always wins our pillow fights. We didn'tnmake too much mess; well not as much as we did on the plane anyway. \"Sorryngirls it's too late to go out now but how about we do that tomorrowninstead and watch a film for now?\" I told them. \"Whatnwere the plans anyway? You never told us?\" Josie asked. \"It'sna surprise!\" I told them smiling. \"And I'm not telling!\" \"Finenbut only because I know we will never get it out of you,\" Kate saidnsmiling. So insteadnwe put on Grease. I know its old but it's a classic and youncan't beat it can ya? I alsonmade us some popcorn (not the microwavable ones) for us to munch on.nOver the years I have perfected my popcorn making skills, it was thenone thing on my diet I would eat that was carby and sugary. Well youncan't watch a good film without popcorn as me and Molly always say. \"Gongrease lightning your…\" We were soon belting out. I realisednI had definitely chose the right film. Everyone was up and dancingnand singing whenever a song came on, it was great and my chest hurtnfrom laughing so much by the end. When thenfilm eventually finished Josie was already asleep and the others werennearly there so I turned the television and DVD player off and wentnand sat on the stairs to ring Freddy. Soon I wasnlistening to a ringing sound with my phone pressed against my ear. Inchecked my watch and it was only 10 o'clock so he should be up. A couplenof rings later I heard his voice. \"Hey trouble.\" I couldninstantly tell I had woken him up. \"Heynsorry I didn't mean to wake you I thought you would be up,\" Intold him hoping he wasn't mad I hadn't called earlier. \"Benawake? Its 3 in the morning,\" He said. Shit I forgot… \"Shit Inforgot the time difference. I'm sorry do you want me to go?\" Insaid feeling really bad. \"Nope Inwant you to stay right where you are and tell me how your day hasnbeen.\" He said. Aaaw he is so sweet sometimes aint he? Even thoughnI woke him up at 3 in the morning, even I would be pissed if I wasnhim. I get grouch when I don't get enough sleep, \"It'snbeen great, the girls love it here. We haven't really done much yetnthough just watched a film and chilled.\" I told him. \"Whatnfilm?\" \"Grease!\"nI said laughing. \"TypicalnI bet that is one of your favourite films.\" As he spoke I couldnalmost see the smile on his face. \"Yep!\"nI replied. Amazing how he already knows me so well. We startednchatting endlessly until we started asking each other randomnquestions. \"What'snyour favourite flavour ice cream?\" he asked. After we had alreadynspent endless hours finding out random things about each other. \"That'sneasy mint chocolate chip!\" I replied. \"When's your birthday?\" \"13thnApril. Now to get to some more serious questions.\" I could hear himnsmiling if that's even possible. \"Poppy Moore would you like tonbe my girlfriend? Like officially?\" Oh myngawd! I can't believe he just asked that or that he even needs tonask of course I will. I have never had a boyfriend officially just guys I have got with and that. \"Youndon't have to say yes, I mean I wont be offended, we could justncarry…\" he started. \"Shut upnand let me speak,\" I told him smiling down the phone. \"I wouldnlove to be your girlfriend.\" \"Good!\" \"ShitnFreddy it must be morning there by now. Its 2 in the morning here sonthat makes it 7 in England. You should have told me!\" I saidnshocked. \"I don'tnmind, you get to be trouble. Being tired for a day is worth it when Inget to talk to you for a night.\" Aaaw he isnthe best boyfriend ever! EventuallynI said goodbye and curled up in bed and fell asleep with only happynthoughts buzzing through my head. Heynguys sorry it's not very long! I just wanted to update quicklynlolls! Nextntime – Freddie may be about!?! (not sure yet) and the girls have tongo on their day out. Whoop!nThey are official now =] Lols Pleasenreview! It inspires me to update faster.

WellnI decided to update as soon as possible because I move out of home onnSaturday and I wont have the internet until I get paid next. But Inwill be able to write there I just won't be able to post them untilnI visit home and have the internet. Good news I am only a 20 minutendrive home so I will be home often. So keep your fingers crossed! Inknow I'm that good! I'm only 17 (18 in April) and I'm movingnout =] I amnexcited but nervous and my cooking skills are shocking! Lols so ifnyou don't here from me for a while its because I have given myselfnfood poisoning! Okay… Recapn– Freddie and Poppy are official! The girls watched Grease withnlots of singing! Sonlet's begin… The nextnmorning I woke up to someone speaking. \"Shouldnwe wake her?\" The voice whispered. It took mena while to register who it was and suddenly it dawned on me that thengirls were here and my eyes opened and I flew up. \"Shitnwhat's the time?\" I asked them quickly. \"Chillnits only half 9 Poppy,\" Molly said. She had ended up watching thenfilm with us and bunked with us for the night. \"That'snokay then I thought we were not going to be able today and have to donit for another day,\" I said calming down. We have tonbe ready for Saturday night and that involves a day out before. I am sooonexcited, I want the girls to see how I live and discover more aboutnme and my life over here. \"Okaynthen we best get ready cus I wanna know what's going on!\" Katenexclaimed. After annhour of beautying ourselves up we were ready to hit the streets ofnMalibu. I have to admit we looked gorgeous, if only Freddy was here. We go outnof the house and the cab I had ordered was waiting for us at thengates. \"Can'tnyou tell us now?\" Drippy begged as the cab continued on itsnjourney. \"OkaynKiki explain,\" I said looking at Kiki. \"She wasnin on it the whole time?\" Josie said. \"That's no fair!\" \"Okayngirls. Project Friday night. Step one, Get gorgeous!!\" She said notnmaking it sound like a maths lesson as she used to. After notnlong we pulled up down a tiny narrow street. \"Are younsure we're at the right place Poppy?\" Kate asked lookingnconfused. \"Yehnpositive,\" I said smiling. This wasnthe only place I would go to get my hair done (well except ChrissienCuts when I was in England). Its like a hidden gem, not many knownabout it but those that did always had the best hair and were notnabout to let it slip where they had it done. But my girls arendifferent and they deserve the best! I hadnlight brown highlights added to my hair and had it layered. Drippynhad her frizzy hair straightened and lightly highlighted with subtlenhoney colours. Kate shocked us all when she had hers cut surprisinglynshort but it did look amazing. Josie had a blonde almost white streaknput in the front of her hair and Kiki randomly had blue highlights. \"We sooonlook hot!\" I said pulling out my camera phone and taking a photo. I thennsent it to Freddie for his opinion with the subject as 'what do younthink? X' It wasn'tnlong before I got a reply You allnlook amazing. Especially you baby x I showednthe girls and got a chorus of aaaaw's. Afternfinishing shopping for new dresses (all designer and brought onndaddy's credit card) we headed out. You seenone of my old friends was having a party and she was in a differentncliché to Ruby so I decided we should go seeing as I doubt Rubynwould go. Anne, thengirl who was throwing the party, was one of the sweetest girls youncould ever meet. When wenarrived eyes turned on us. Well can you blame them? I walkednconfidently in front with my girls behind me. Hair blowing in thenwind and stilettos singing with every step we take. At firstnthe girls stuck close by and then eventually as they grew morenconfident around so many people they spread out and started tonsocialise. The Americans found the English girls fascinating,nespecially the guys. When I wasnstarting to feel slightly more than tipsy I saw him. Roddy. The guy Inhad thought I had once loved. The guynwho cheated on me with my best friend. The onenguy I hadn't wanted to see tonight. I closednher eyes and told myself to be strong and then downed a couple morendrinks. ' Illnshow him what he missed out on' I thought to myself. I quicklynfound Kate and grabbed her hand. Kate was pissed but somehow I thinknshe was more sober than me. I startedngrinding her and dancing as sexily as I could pissed out of my head.nShe soon joined in and all the guys started whistling and cheering usnon. I looked for Roddy in the crowd and looked directly into his eyesnas he watched us. Oh yeh he was definitely jealous. Soon I wasntoo tired to dance anymore and way to pissed to stand and make smallntalk so I scrambled up the stairs and helped myself to one of thenbeds in the big mansion. For somenreason I thought I heard the door open and thought I was imagining itnuntil I heard it slam shut. I quicklynjumped up. It wasnRoddy. His figurenloomed over me as I sat on the bed. \"What donyou want?\" I asked trying to keep it cool. Roddy was an ass inngeneral but when he had been drinking he was a major ass. \"I wantnyou.\" He replied. \"And I know you want me I could tell by how younwere looking at me when you were dancing.\" \"ActuallynI don't…\" I started before he roughly pushed me on the bed. Now I wasnreally feeling scared. Cliffnhanger!!! Hopenyou enjoyed!! Review!! x[Chapter 4] Hey guys! Wow I cannot believe how long it's been! I have decided to be less annoying and actually finish my stories starting with this one...I know how annoying it is when someone doesn't update so I will try my hardest. Not sure if it's going to be as good as it has been as I have kind of forgot where I was going with this but I will give it a go! Thanks guys x Recap – The girls are at a party and Roddy gets a bit pushy with Poppy... I started feeling really dizzy and the room started to spin. 'I've drunk a lot but not enough to make me feel like this,' I thought to myself. I could see Roddy's figure looming over me and in a panic I tried to grab the nearest thing to me. Eventually my hand grabbed something and I flew it towards the figures head. As it made contact I heard a crack and felt a sudden relief thinking that it was all over. 'That was close' I thought. God knows what he would have done to me and I do not want those slimy hands anywhere near me! Suddenly something caught my eye as my vision got blurrier. \"You're going to pay for that,\" A rough voice said and I shivered. 'What can I do? I could...\" I didn't even get to finish my thoughts when darkness overcame me and I was temporarily lost to the world. Next chapter written so let me know what you think and I may post it tomorrow! =][Chapter 5] My head killed and I felt dizzy. What was going on? I felt a hand grab my wrist tightly and I could already feel the bruising and suddenly it came back to me. Roddy... Roddy had knocked me out! I felt fear and then anger took hold of me. How dare he do that to me? Or to anyone for that matter? It killed my head but I had to force my eyes to open. If I couldn't see I wouldn't be able to get out of this situation and then I dread to think what would happen. The light was painful as dim as it was but I could see him. He was so close I could smell the alcohol on his breath. Okay bravery gone. I'm scared again now! He grabbed hold of my legs and I started to struggle as much as I could but it was no good. I was too dizzy and weak and he was too strong for me. My legs and arms were starting to ache from the tiresome struggle. I didn't know what to do but I knew I couldn't give up. I thrashed more and more and eventually managed to boot him in the face and I thanked god for stilettos, they caused a lot more damage than flats! I managed to get on my legs and grab the door but it was too late he grabbed me again before I even had a chance to open it. I saw his fist go in the air and I closed my eyes waiting for the impact. But it never came. I opened my eyes cautiously and never have I been so relieved in my life. Holding Roddy's fist in the air was Freddy. He looked me in the eyes and it didn't take long for the anger to build in his eyes and before I knew it he had punched Roddy in the face and knocked him out in one punch. My breathing slowed and my heart rate dropped. I was okay and suddenly so very happy. I jumped up as quick as I could, which was apparently too fast as the world suddenly started spinning and again I was in darkness. Great. Hey do you guys want more?[Chapter 6] Had to edit this chapter as forgot the party was at someone elses house! Hope it still makes sense! Also nearly finished the next chapter as I am on a roll with this fic now so if your all nice I may upload tomorrow! So glad you guys are enjoying this story still =D Hopefully this chapter will be slightly longer than previous! ... My eyes were struggling to open. 'Bloody Roddy' Was all I could think. I had known him so long and yes he was a prat but I still didn't think he was capable of this, even with the alcohol. Maybe I'm not as good a judge of character as I thought. No that was definitely the old me. There is a reason why Roddy wasn't in my life now,. I didn't want to open my eyes. I was so peaceful and tired until I realised something. Freddy was here! It was painful and the light was far too bright once again but I managed to pull my eyes open and hold them open until the silhouettes became faces I recognised. 'Hi girls. Hi Freddy.' I said as though nothing had happened. 'Hey trouble.' Freddie spoke first his worried face slowly creased into a smile. 'You worried us there, the girls were about 4 seconds away from calling an ambulance.' I have to say it was nice to know they all cared. Definitely a good judge of character these days, Ruby would have slipped the Loui Vuitton heels straight from my feet and said they shouldn't go to waste. Oh well at least I learnt from my mistakes. 'I'll live guys although some pain killers would be amazing. Thanks for being there for me guys I really appreciate it.' I told them looking into Freddies oh so delicious eyes. 'If you carry on with this soppy shit we will leave you next time,' Drippy said smirking. 'Hey I'm not that bad.' I said laughing. I grabbed the nearest pillow and chucked it in her direction. It just caught her arm. 'I'll get you back when you least expect it Miss Moore.' Said Drippy trying to look evil but doing a poor job of it indeed. 'There's ice cream in the freezer. Help yourself Drippy.' I told her knowing her weakness and knowing the girl that threw the party always had ice cream. 'Okay your forgiven I love you.' She replied in one breath and disappeared in seconds. I couldn't help but smile. We might have the weirdest conversations and strangest sense of humour but my friends are amazing and I wouldn't change a single thing about them. 'Everyone's left the party except for the girl throwing it, whatever her name is. She's passed out in one of the rooms so we will go join Drippy on the ice cream gorge and give you guys some time alone.' Kate said winking at me before they left the room. Yep, definitely the most amazing friends ever. I leaned against the bed and closed my eyes wishing for my headache to disappear. 'I'll be back in one second trouble.' I heard Freddie speak and then felt him give my forehead a kiss. Somehow it soothed my headache and I smiled yet again. It's amazing I can smile after everything that's happened in the last few hours but for some reason I can't help myself. Before I could wonder where Freddy had gone I heard the door close and opened my eyes. There he was with a glass of water in one hand and some pain killers in the other. I'm starting to think he can read my mind. 'You are my absolute knight in shining armour right now.' I smiled at him and then took my pills. 'Well it was meant to be a surprise happy visit. I'm just sorry I wasn't here earlier. The girls gave me the address of the party earlier' He said whilst plonking himself on the floor next to me. 'I should have known trouble follows trouble.' He winked at me and my tummy started doing somersaults. 'Well it was certainly a surprise and a happy one at that. I'm just glad you turned up when you did. Although I'm sure I could have taken him in the end.' I replied. I was pretty sure I couldn't have taken him. He was much bigger and stronger than me but Freddy didn't have to know that and he didn't need to see me being weak. 'Trouble, you don't have to pretend with me. I know how much that must have scared you and I'm not saying you can't take care of yourself but I'm here to help in whatever way you need.' He said putting his arm around me and pulling me onto his chest. Then I could feel it coming. My eyes were watering and my breaths were getting shorter. 'It's okay baby,' He soothed me. I don't cry. Especially around males. But apparently the new Poppy does because in the total of about 6 seconds I was sobbing into Freddy's chest and he was pulling me tighter. It is true I do seem to attract trouble even when I'm trying to avoid it. Maybe that's just me. After what seemed like forever I got it together and gave my face a wipe. 'I'm sorry I got your t shirt wet.' I said to him. I had in fact drenched it with tears and felt suddenly guilty. 'No need to apologise trouble. So long as you feel better.' He was right I did feel better. I looked up at his green eyes and he raised his hand to wipe away a stray tear and all I could think about was kissing him. To be fair being saved by your very handsome boyfriend was definitely sexy and so I closed my eyes and moved my head to meet his. When we met I could feel the warmth radiating from his soft perfect lips, sometimes these days I felt like I was watching somebody else's life. Things have changed so much so quickly and although it's in a good way it just sometimes feels too good to be true. This was definitely one of those moments. How did I get so lucky? Once we parted, which I was very disappointed about might I add, I couldn't help but yawn. 'I think I had better get you home missey,' He said to me softly and offered me a hand to help me up. We headed downstairs and I couldn't believe what a state the house was in. Thank god I'm not the one who has to tidy it up. We gathered the girls and walked silently home me and Freddy hand in hand. Once we got home we sat in the kitchen going over the events when Freddy noticed how tired I was. 'Time for bed I think trouble. Why don't you go get your pyjamas on and then give me a shout?' He asked. I agreed but only because I was so tired I wasn't capable of anything else. Although it was tempting to stay up all night with his lips against mine. You can't blame a girl he was a good kisser after all! I dragged myself to my room and chucked on a pair of shorts and a tank top. I still wanted to look half good even if I was sleeping. Some of the old me was definitely still there I just hope I've kept the good habits and got rid of the bad ones. I looked in the mirror and was shocked at the state I was in. My hair looked like I had been dragged through a whole freaking rainforest never mind a bloody bush and forget panda eyes, there wasn't an animal in the world that could describe the black streaks of mascara that ran down my face. I sighed and got to work brushing my hair and removing my makeup. When I was done I pulled on my super fluffy slipper boots and headed downstairs. Freddy was talking to the girls who were putting away the ice cream we had got out at mine and getting ready for bed themselves. 'How are you feeling?' Kate asked. The girls all looked super sympathetic so I put on my best smile and told them I was fine just in need of a good night's sleep. After we all said night and had a cuddle me and Freddy headed upstairs and left the girls to pack away. When we got to my room I sat on the bed and Freddy came over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. 'Shall I sleep in another room? I understand if you want to be by yourself.' He can't go. I need him I thought to myself. 'Please stay.' I said meekly. He looked happy and relieved I'd said he could stay with me. Soon we were curled up in bed letting the world of sleep claim us. And it was certainly a heavenly place to be with Freddy's wrapped around me. The end (Of the chapter that is!) ... Hope you guys enjoyed this chapter and thank you so much for reading. Reviewing. Following. For everything pretty much! Your support is awesome and I can't thank you enough! =] Also let me know if you want another chapter ;) Can't beat a bit of bribery! Peace out![Chapter 7] Thank you for my 3 reviewers for the last chapter this one's for you guys =] And thanks for the advice I shall try to follow it! I woke up feeling ridiculously happy for the first time in my life. And trust me when I say this, I am NOT a morning person. Me and Freddy might be very new but waking up in his arms felt natural. Okay maybe the girls are right and I am getting too lovey dovey, to hell with it you only live once and I want to enjoy every moment of this even if it does mean turning to the soft side. It was warm and felt strangely safe wrapped in his arms. I would love to see the look on Harriet's face if she could see us now. Harriet had been a total bitch my first year at Abbey Mount and had her eye on Freddy for a long time. To be fair it was an all girl's school and Freddy was the only decent eye candy we got on a regular basis however Harriet also made everyone's lives hell and used new students to be pretty much her slaves. Poor girl never stood a chance with me, I never have and never will be someone's bitch. Enough said. Anyway back to the glorious feeling of being in Freddy's arms. Because I have never had a serious relationship or never gone very far with guys, as much as some people will tell you otherwise, this is my first time waking up with someone else other than having girls over for a sleepover. To say I liked it was an understatement. Although I remember when I was really young and if I had a nightmare mum would let me curl up in bed with her dad. I miss her so much but I'm positive she would be proud of me and she would have loved Freddy. Sometimes I sit and wonder what would have happened to me if she was still alive. I'm sure I would have still been the same person and my dad raised me how she would have wanted but if she was there would she have made me go to Abbey Mount? And if not would I have rebelled and got sent there against my wishes? I could only wonder and 'what' and 'if' are dangerous words when put together. Instead all I can do is enjoy every day as much as I can and hope somewhere she is looking down at me proud. 'Morning trouble.' A deep voice says disturbing me from my thoughts.. I turned over to smile at him 'Morning.' 'How are you feeling? Is your head any better?' He asked me. 'I'm okay, slightly bruised in places but it could have been worse.' I said shrugging it off. It was true I was fine and I was just thankful it hadn't been worse. There's no point in dwelling on the past. 'How does food and coffee sound?' As much as I wanted to stay in bed with him all day coffee and food sounded like just what the doctor ordered. 'Okay that sounds good.' I replied. 'Okay you jump in the shower and I'll get started downstairs,' He said smiling and jumping out of bed still clothed from the night before. 'Are you trying to say I smell or something?' I asked winking. 'Well now that you mention it...' He said smirking at me. 'Trust me you will feel much better after it he said giving me a kiss and holding down the pillows before I had a chance to throw one at him. Yep this boy could definitely read my mind. After he left I jumped in the shower and enjoyed the warm water running over my slightly aching body and felt much better and refreshed. It was like I was washing away everything that had happened the previous night and starting afresh. After I had finished dressing and applied some subtle make up I headed downstairs to the smell of bacon and coffee and damn it smelt good. It was a funny sight to see Freddy dresses in an apron whilst the girls were the ones sat round the table chatting away. As soon as they saw me the girls all asked me at once how I was feeling and it took lots of reassurance to let them know I was fine. I plonked down in one of the kitchen chairs and watched Freddy finish off cooking the bacon. He looked very domesticated and at home and soon he was sharing out bacon sandwiches and pouring out a jug of coffee for everyone. Everyone was quiet whilst we were eating and trust Drippy to be the one to break the silence. 'Poppy can I have him when you're done? A man that cooks and kicks ass sounds pretty good.' She said jokingly. 'Hmmm what do you think Freddy?' I asked him curious of his response. Its always fun to put a man on the spot. 'Sorry Drippy but I'm stuck with this one for as long as she'll have me,' he said making me smile. He finished his sandwich before giving me a kiss on the cheek and announcing he was going to take a shower. As soon as he left the room the questions came. 'Did he stay in your room last night?' 'Did you do anything else?' 'Have you said the 'L' word yet?' 'Do you love him?' 'Are you going to marry him?' 'How are you going to tell Mrs Kingsley?' 'Are you going to tell Mrs Kingsley or keep it a secret?' They were asking questions before I could even answer them but I wasn't mad because I know if it was the other way round I would be the same. It's what best friends are for after all. 'For a start we just spent the night SLEEPING together and to everything else I don't know,' I answered. It was true about all the rest but I don't want to think about that yet. I want to stay in my happy bubble for a little bit longer. 'Okay but if you get married I want to be a bridesmaid,' replied Kiki. 'Okay I promise you will all be bridesmaids.' I had to laugh at them. They sure did love me as much as I loved them and it was a good feeling. A few moments later I heard Freddy coming down the stairs. He still only had a towel wrapped round his waste and he looked literally edible with water dripping down his very toned body. We couldn't help it. All 5 of us were sat wide mouthed gaping at him. Definitely one lucky lady. Freddy suddenly seemed slightly awkward and unsure of himself for the first time that I have ever seen and I have to hold back from laughing at him. 'Erm Poppy I just wanted to see where you wanted me to put the towel when I was done,' He said not knowing who to look at. 'Just bung it in the washing basket in the bathroom.' I said smiling as he awkwardly exited the room. As soon as he left we all burst out laughing. Yes I am a terrible girlfriend but it was oh so much fun. I decided I had better wash up seeing as Freddy had cooked and rather than bung it in the dishwasher like I normally would have done I decided to wash it by hand. I like to wash up sometimes, it was relaxing and plus I wanted Freddy to see I could be slightly domesticated. When he came downstairs he wrapped his arms around me from behind and nuzzled my ear. I am definitely washing up more often. 'So what's the game plan for today?' Kiki asked. 'Anything less eventful than last night would be great,' I smiled. Quiet sounded good. My dad and Molly chose that moment to come downstairs and greet everyone. 'Hi girls and you must be Freddy,' my dad said lifting a hand to shake Freddy's. 'How do you know about Freddy Daddy?' I asked confused. 'He called ahead to check it was okay to visit and he was so polite that I could hardly refuse.' My dad said giving Freddy a pat on the back. Well that's weird Dad never likes any of my boyfriends, even friends who just happened to be guys. 'Anyway I think we should go for dinner tonight to get to know each other better.' He even wanted to get to know Freddy? I wonder what Freddy said to him on the phone. 'Sounds great Daddy.' I smiled. 'Well while you guys have dinner why don't me and the girls go to the cinema and let you guys bond a bit?' Suggested Kate. I kinda wanted them as a barrier as I knew if we had nothing to talk about they would find something but I suppose it was for the best. 'Thank guys.' I smiled. I suppose I had better prepare myself for tonight then. You guys excited about the dinner? I am! Please review! ","Summary":" Heynguys! Suddenlynhad the urge to write a Wild Child fanfic so here I am lols! Hopenyou enjoy! Rea"},{"Movie":"Gettysburg","Title":"Buford's Cavalry","Author":"CAVALRYMAN1863","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12554593","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It was late June of 1863, the men of the 1st Cavalry Division of the Union Cavalry Corps under Brigadier General John Buford, was riding through Pennsylvania, screening and counter-screening Jeb Stuart's Cavalry and the Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E Lee. The Vanguard of the Union Army, the 1st and 11th Corps was not far behind Gen Buford's Cavalrymen, one trooper was Sergeant-Major Reynolds of the United States 2nd Cavalry, his company was attached to the 8th New York Regiment in the 1st Brigade under Colonel William Gamble, while the rest of the 2nd Cavalry and the 3rd Brigade of the Division made up of all the United State Army's Regular Cavalry under Brigadier General Wesley Merritt was in Maryland watching the fords across the Potomac and conducting patrols around Washington. General Lee's army was on the move north for the second time in the entire war, and General Joseph 'Fighting Joe' Hooker had been replaced by General George G Meade and the Union Army were hot on the heels of Lee's Army. After Gen Stoneman's Raid into Virginia, which incorporated the battle of Tennessee Ridge, the Sergeant-Major had fought in the battles of Brandy Station, Aldie, and Upperville with the 1st Cavalry Division, all while in the pursuit of Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. Now the men were in Southern Pennsylvania riding North, the men had been riding all day and they were exhausted, and so were the horses. Since the battle of Chancellorsville, the Army of Northern Virginia had been on the move North, with the Army of the Potomac right behind. It was believed by all that they were heading for Harrisburg, the State Capital where much needed supplies could be procured by the Rebel Army. It was also believed that it was to draw the Army out of Virginia and defeat it on northern soil to get Britain and France on the side of the South. The young 19 year old Sergeant-Major looked up at the sky, and thought for a moment, that the war was far away and he was riding in the Pennsylvania countryside, he breathed in the air and admired the countryside. Then he remembered he was in a column of an entire Cavalry Division chasing 'Johnny Reb' he then jolted when he felt someone tap his shoulder. \"Sergeant-Major.\" He turned to his Company commander, who had replaced the last one since the death of Capt McCord after the Battle of Tennessee Ridge. He was an older man, probably in his mid forties with a long curly grey mustache, wearing a kepi with an officers shell jacket with golden shoulder boards with captain's bars. \"Yes sir?\" Replied the Sergeant-Major turned to his new commanding officer. \"I want you to take a squad of men into that town, make sure you can establish some order and get the civilians off the streets.\" The Sergeant-Major saluted and the Captain returned it, the Sergeant-Major then pulled out his silver lined Colt 1860 Revolver he was given after 1st Bull Run for, 'Gallantry and Bravery under fire' and remembered his father's face that day, Matthew Brady took a picture of them that he kept close by as a memory of his late father. He was getting tear in his eye which he quickly wiped away. He took the second squad and they fell out of the ranks and galloped quickly into the small town. He could see the white board houses with the rail fences, a small white church and it's steeple as well as the seminary with the white cupola that appeared to have a commanding view of the town. The men got the civilians indoors and saw the battle flags of a Confederate Regiment, or perhaps it was a Brigade, some of the men, including him had reached for their carbines, but there was no shooting, no nothing. Meanwhile The Division continued to gallop on until they reached the outskirts of a small Pennsylvania town, at the head of the column was General John Buford and his Staff, with two of his Brigade commanders, Colonel William Gamble, and Colonel Thomas Casimer Devin. They had winded their way through hills and mountain gaps, the same way the Confederates had come. From where they were they could see the small town and a seminary to the west of it. To the south, there were two hills, one full of trees with the summer color of green, the other flat with what appeared to be a cemetery. The General had halted the column from where he was, by a stone wall in that cemetery, and from the road below was Col Gamble's Brigade. He had ridden up to Gen Buford and his staff, they pulled out their field glasses and looked through them to see a large body of men marching into the town, at first it appeared to be a Confederate Raiding Party, but there was too many of them, there was power behind it, troops far back up the road toward the hills. \"That's Infantry alright, at least a full Brigade.\" Stated the Colonel, the General smoked his pipe and looked through his binoculars to see what Gamble was seeing. The general looked for any other movement, and saw one squad of his own men enter the town, he saw that they had their carbines handy, but there was no shooting, none whatsoever. \"Any sign of Cavalry?\" asked General Buford, Col Gamble looked left and right, but saw no men in gray on horseback, and shook his head and wheezed. \"No sir, it's very strange, Infantry moving in enemy country blind, it's very strange sir.\" The General put the field glasses back in their brown leather case and held his pipe, still being smoked. \"He's heading this way.\" His officers looked at him. \"Lee's turned that's the main body.\" Col Gamble looked through his binoculars again. \"You think so, I could have sworn he was heading for Harrisburg.\" The General nodded. \"Well he was, but that's too many troops to be a raiding party\" He took his pipe out of his mouth and spoke up again. \"There's power behind it.\" The Colonel turned to face his superior. \"Sir, if you want to fight here, this is lovely ground, it's the best damn ground I've seen all day.\" Buford nodded, it was indeed lovely ground. \"It is that.\" He looked through his binoculars again and looked at the town. \"We'll move both Brigades into town, that'll make the good citizens happy.\" he looked again at his Brigade commander. \"Let's go down there and have a look.\" The Colonel nodded. \"Sir.\" The staff rejoined at the front of the column and they moved into the small town, called Gettysburg. General John Buford was a Kentucky born Union man, West Point class of 1848, he had fought in the Indian wars out west and was old style cavalry. He was careful and not a risk taker, warmonger, or glory hound. He merely wanted to focus on the task at hand, but he could sense what would happen here, Lee had turned and was heading right for the brunt of the Union Army. He rode at the head of the column through the town, with the rest of his Division in tow, the streets were deserted, no people, no dogs, not even a mouse. White faces were in the windows, and the curtains of houses fluttered with the civilians peaking out as the men passed through Gettysburg. As the men passed through, the squad that entered the town fell in with their company and continued on through the town. There was nothing, no chickens, no cattle, not even a plow horse, the Rebels had foraged the land bare and didn't leave much to the civilian populace. As the trotted through on their horses, they could see the Rebel column moving away from them, towards the western blue sky and the hills. Just then a shot was fired and the General's staff officers ducked at the sound, but he ignored it, he kept thinking that the Rebs would be back in the morning, and how Lee's army would move towards the town and being to concentrate his forces. He turned too look back at the high ground to the south, that morning the Confederates would be there and General Meade and the army would not be there, nor would General Reynolds and the 1st Corps. His two deputy commanders rode up, Col Gamble gave the General a salute, and Col Devin gave a grin as they approached. \"I wonder where their cavalry is?\" The General sat up in the saddle. \"The way Stuart rides, he's probably having dinner in Philadelphia.\" The General didn't listen to what Devin said, and even if he did, he wouldn't find it funny. \"Get your patrols out, scout this bunch in front of us, but also scout up north, they'll be coming that way from Carlisle. I think Lee's turned the whole army, trying to get around us, between Meade and Washington. If I'm right there'll be a lot of troops up this road, and that northern road too so hop to it.\" Col Gamble saluted. \"Sir.\" He then wheeled his horse and trotted down the line to assign men to scout west. As the Colonel went, General Buford and his staff moved through the town with the rest of the Division and got on top of a small ridge, close to a small farm owned by some named Mcpherson. He passed one of the Regiment's under Gamble's command as they calmly waited for orders. The General stopped a few feet from a rail fence supported by rocks and dismounted his horse. He secured his saber and walked towards the fence, with Col Devin by his side. He had a boyish grin on him with sandy yellow hair and a thick mustache, who seemed to have more courage to go into battle, than the wisdom to find a way to win it. \"You know what's gonna happen here in the morning?\" Col Devin turned to look at his superior. \"Sir?\" The General looked out to the hills to the west. \"The whole damn Reb army's gonna be here, they'll move through this town, occupy those hills, Lee will have the high ground and it'll be the DEVIL to pay. The High Ground! Meade will come in slowly, cautiously, new to command, they'll be on his back from Washington, the wires hot with messages, ' ATTACK, ATTACK !' So he will set up a ring around these hills...\" He pointed to the high ground to the south. \"...and when Lee's army is nice and entrenched behind fat rocks on the high ground, Meade will finally attack, if he can coordinate the army. Straight up the hillside, out in the open, in that gorgeous field of fire. We will charge valiantly, and be butchered valiantly. Then men will bump their chests and saw what a brave charge it was.\" The General took off his hat passed it through his dark brown hair. \"Devin, I've lived a soldier's life, and I've never seen anything a brutally clear as this, it's as if I can see the blue troops in one long bloody moment. Going up the long slope to the stony top, already done, already a memory.\" He put his hat back on. \"An odd, set, stony quality to it, It's as if tomorrow's already happening and there's nothing you can do about it. The way you sometimes wonder before considering attack, knowing it will fail. But you cannot stop it, you must even take part, help it fail.\" Col Devin looked at his Commanding officer. \"Sir.\" The General looked at the ground, and the hills to the west. \"No orders yet, tell your men to dismount and eat, and rest, get some rest.\" General Buford mounted his horse and rode off a little ways to inspect the ground. He wasn't sure if he should make a stand or not, but he knew John Reynolds, he was a good man, but would he get there in time. Would he understand the urgency, would he hurry, the General could not be sure. Then he wondered if he could hold against Lee's whole army, he had two good Brigades at his disposal, but what if they were sacrificed and Reynolds was late. There were only twenty-five hundred of them, all armed with Sharps Carbines and Colt Revolvers, and if dug could hold, but how long would they have to? He had time yet, he was Cavalry and had horses, and if necessary, could get out in a hurry. Meanwhile The young Sergeant-Major was sitting in his saddle looking over his pistol, he made sure it was loaded and that it was clean, he then saw Col Gamble ride up to Capt Buckston and mumbled something to him. The Captain looked back and then back at the Colonel, he saluted his superior who saluted back. The Colonel then wheeled his horse and rode to the front of the Brigade as the Captain rode towards the Sergeant-Major. \"What's going on sir?\" The Captain took off his kepi and wiped the sweat from his forehead. \"The Colonel wants me to send a few men as scouts to see how far the Confederate positions are from the town, and us.\" Were they going to stay and hold against Lee, if it was Lee. From what he saw from the town, he could say it was a Brigade, too big for a raiding party, too small to do much else against the Army of the Potomac, or a small Cavalry Division. \"Who do I take sir?\" asked the Sergeant-Major, the Captain placed his kepi back on his head. \"Take five men of your choice, volunteers.\" The Sergeant-Major nodded and saluted his commanding officer, the Captain returned the saluted and rode down the line to find his second in command. The Sergeant-Major fell out of the line and began to call out names. \"MULCAHY, QUINCANNON, O'RYAN, THOMAS, MILLER!\" The five men turned their heads towards the voice who called them. \"YOU FIVE JUST VOLUNTEERED FOR SCOUTING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE REB PICKETTS!\" The men groaned, and fell out of the column. Mulcahy, O'Ryan and Quincannon were Line Sergeants and old friends of the Sergeant-Major's late father who had fallen at the Battle of Fredericksburg. The five galloped north and then west in the direction where the Confederate Brigade had come from and then retreated from the sight of the Division, they moved across a small run that was easily fordable. They continued to trot on their horses and moved through the open fields and farmland right next to the Chambersburg Pike and cut across an open field. They continued through and got back on the road, they moved their horses at a walk, they soon came across a line of trees and stopped, they had gone about four miles from Gettysburg and had seen or heard nothing from the Confederates. The Sergeant-Major took out a pair of Binoculars he 'requisitioned' from the Company Quartermaster Sergeant. He looked through the binoculars and saw something that was of interest to him, he saw a man with a rifle, it could have been a Confederate or it was a farmer that thought they were Confederates. He then saw the man raise his rifle, he quickly put the binoculars back in his saddle bag and, he had just closed the flap when the crack of a rifle was heard from where they were followed by a thump on the ground. Sgt O'Ryan had fallen off his horse, the others had begun to laugh, but Sgt-Major Nathan Carter Reynolds was in no mood for laughter. \"Are you alright O'Ryan?\" The Sergeant looked up at the Sergeant-Major and nodded. \"Sorry Nathan, that gunshot scared me and well, made me fall off my horse.\" The men began to laugh again when another gunshot sounded through the air. The Sergeant-Major grabbed the binoculars out of his saddle bags again and saw other men with rifles, he counted how many there were and counted ten. \"We'll make it look like we fell back, then see if we can identify who they are.\" O'Ryan got back on his horse and the men moved northeast, making it appear as if they were moving back, but they outflanked the picketts and proceeded further. They continued on through fields, avoiding the main road to see an encampment of troops, the regiments belong to a Brigade under General Archer of Mississippi, who was in General Heth's Division, who belonged to General AP Hill's Corps. \"Those men belong to Archer's Brigade, which means Heth's Division, which means Hill's Corps.\" The scouts then saw another Brigade brought up by Regiment, it was several Texas Regiments. \"Texas Regiments, Hood?\" asked Sgt Nulcahy in awe, the men nodded. \"Without any doubt.\" replied Sgt Quincannon, the Sergeant-Major pulled off the binoculars and turned to face the others. \"If that's Hood's Texans the rest of his Division behind that, that says James Longstreet is not far behind with his own Corps.\" The men just sat there before deciding they had enough information. \"Let's get back, we need to report this.\" The men were back in the town as soon as they left, they were as lucky as they could be since no enemy picketts spotted them riding back. The men still sat in the saddle, waiting for orders, they saw Col Gamble near Capt Buckston and they were talking, the Sergeant-Major told the men to get back in the column with the other men as he went to make the report. The Captain and Colonel saw him approach on his dark brown horse, he saluted the two officers. \"Well Sergeant-Major, did you find out anything?\" The Colonel also seemed to be interested. \"We sited enemy picketts four miles from our position sir,then we saw elements of Mississippi Regiments, those mean Hill's Corps, then we noticed elements of Longstreet's Corps behind them.\" Colonel Gamble looked at the Sergeant-Major with a vigorous interest. \"Are you sure Sergeant?\" The young Sergeant-Major nodded. \"Positive sir, they look to me there gonna concentrate here in the morning, seeing how many men we saw and all.\" The Colonel nodded and then turned to the Captain. \"Captain, you better come with me.\" The Captain nodded and turned to the Sergeant-Major. \"Sergeant, tell Lt Carr he's in command until I return.\" The two officers galloped off towards the front of the column. The Sergeant-Major didn't like Lt Carr, he was a Marylander who didn't like the President, who's family had ties with the south, and only wore the uniform to find glory. Even though he didn't want to wish death upon anyone, he hoped that a bullet would find Lt Carr. A few Minutes Later General Buford went over the ground, and saw that Devin's Brigade must have headed north to cover the approach from Carlisle, he saw the Colonel ride up the road with the same boyish grin. \"My Brigade is dismounted sir, any orders.\" The Colonel dismounted and waited for a reply, the General had been thinking long and hard about whether to make a stand or to get the hell out. He then remembered the Horse Artillery under Lt John Calef, he had twenty-five hundred men, and a battery of 3-inch ordnance rifles at his disposal. \"Is Calef's battery up yet?\" The Colonel turned to look at his commanding officer. \"Sir, his six guns are deploying forward now, but they will take a while to get set up since they're at the rear of the column with the ordnance wagons.\" The General nodded. \"Have the bugler sound officer's call.\" He then turned to his staff officers. \"HOW FAR BACK IS REYNOLDS WITH THE MAIN FORCE?\" One his officers looked back and responded. \"About ten miles sir, not much more.\" Just then hoof beats from two horses could be heard on the road. Through the air, the bugler played the tune 'Officers Call' as two riders pulled in through an opening in the rail fence next to the road, it was Col Gamble and a Captain. \"Sir!\" The Colonel dismounted his horse and a trooper quickly went to hold it so it wouldn't run off. \"Your right, my scouts report the Reb army's coming this way and that's for sure, they're all concentrating in this direction.\" The staff officer's gathered around after 'Officers Call' was sounded, the General looked back at the field in front of him. \"We're gonna hold here in the morning, long enough for Reynolds and the Infantry to arrive. We hang onto the high ground we have a good chance to win this fight that's coming. Understood?\" The officers nodded. \"Yes sir.\" They shouted in unison. \"Post the cannon along this road, the Chambersburg Pike, the Rebs will hit us at dawn but I think we can hold them, at least two hours.\" Colonel Devin looked up at his superior \"Hell General, we can hold them all the damn live long day.\" The other officers agreed with Col Devin, but the General shook his head. \"No you won't, you'll have to fight like the devil to hold your own.\" The Brigade commander looked straight at the General \"But sir, at Thoroughfare Gap you held against Longstreet, you held for six hours.\" Col Gamble then turned to Col Devin to say something. \"And reinforcements never came, we held for nothing.\" The officers held their heads, they remembered how the General sent request after request for reinforcements, but never came. The General turned to look at the long ridge on the farmland outside of the town. \"The Rebs will hit us just about first light, Keep a Clear Eye! I want the picketts to give us a good warning.\" He turned back to his officers. \"Alright gentlemen, let's get posted.\" The officers mounted their horses again and saw as Col Gamble's Brigade moved down the road and moved off the road to take cover and dig in. Regimental commanders such as Lieutenant-Colonels and Majors move their Regiments into line in the fields and behind the rail fence supported by stone and Junior officers such as Captains and Lieutenants moved their companies, one next to another. Three men to dismount, every forth man to fall back holding the horses, the General and his Staff sat on their horses as they watched the Brigade dismount and dig in. The men galloping into the field and dismounting, setting up and sending out videttes and more scouts to see who would be coming down the road. General Buford knew his men, he knew they would do their job, good boys he thought, he and his staff then turned their horses east and headed back towards the Seminary. Meanwhile The Sergeant-Major waited with the others, and saw movement in front of them, the Brigade was moving at the gallop, they then saw the Captain ride down to them almost at lightening speed. Lt Carr was at the front of the company, freshly polished boots and kepi with gold braid on the crown of the kepi, he saluted the Captain who returned it, then spoke to the Sergeant-Major. \"Sergeant-Major, get the men moving, we're dismounting and digging in on and around the Chambersburg Pike, we'll be holding in the morning.\" The Sergeant-Major smiled, they would hold their position, although outnumbered, they would be given the chance to hold. \"Yes sir.\"He turned to the other men behind him, veterans of battle, from First Bull Run to Chancellorsville, Regular soldiers of the professional army. \"B TROOP, FORWARD HO!\" The men began to gallop down the road with Carbines drawn, taking position with the 8th New York Cavalry behind the rail fence, dismounting and taking positions behind the fence, one platoon heading out further, beyond the fence to act as forward skirmishers along with others in the the 8th New York and in Col Gamble's Brigade. When Nathan gave his horse to Trooper Miller, he saw that General Buford and his Staff were watching them prepare, he personally knew that the General was a good man, and would do his duty to the best of his ability, like his men. He saw Lt Carr walk up to him and he stood at attention. \"Sergeant-Major, the Captain needs you to take this report to Gen Buford personally.\" He took the paper, saluted his superior and went off to get his horse. He looked at the paper quickly and saw that it was a report of what they had as arms and munitions they were armed with and how much more ammunition was needed. But it was for the entire 8th New York, not just the Company. He got his horse and galloped up towards the Seminary when he was stopped by a sentry. \"HALT, advance and be recognized.\" The Sergeant-Major moved up slowly. \"Sergeant-Major Reynolds, Second Cavalry, B Company, attached to the 8th New York.\" The sentry looked him over from the distance they were at. \"Give the countersign.\" The Sergeant-Major shouted the reply the trooper asked for \"Antietam.\" The sentry allowed the Sergeant-Major to approach, he then got off his horse and a corporal held it, he walked up to the officers when one approached him. \"What's your name trooper?\" The Sergeant-Major quickly brought up his right hand and saluted the officer. \"Sergeant-Major Nathan Reynolds sir, carrying papers for Gen Buford.\" The Officer nodded and led him to the General who was writing something on a piece of paper. The General didn't have his coat with his shoulder boards on, nor his black curved brimmed hat smoking his pipe. The General looked up at the officer approaching him and the Sergeant-Major following him. General Buford sipped a cup of Coffee as he wrote a courier message to Gen Reynolds when he was approached by Col Devin in the dark. The Colonel took off his kepi and spoke to the General. \"The last of the scouts have come in, confirming everything, it's Hill to the west and the majority think it's Ewell to the North sir.\" The General nodded. \"Very well Devin, you better get back to your men and get some rest.\" As the Colonel saluted, and walked off, he saw a young Lieutenant walk up with a Sergeant-Major \"What is it Lieutenant?\" The officer stood at attention and saluted the General. \"Sir, this is Sgt-Major Reynolds of the Second Cavalry, his company is attached with a Regiment in Col Gamble's Brigade. He brought a list of ordnance that the 8th New York, including his company would need.\" The General looked over at the Sergeant-Major, and he merely stood at attention, the General looked him over, he appeared no older than nineteen, possibly twenty, but he had dust from riding on his uniform, and a look on his face that he could tell made him an experienced cavalryman \"Your a regular son?\" Nathan looked at the General and nodded. \"Yes sir, when I heard about the firing on Fort Sumter, I enlisted in the Regulars, to fight with experienced troops of the plains.\" The General nodded, he then looked at the Lieutenant. \"Your dismissed Lieutenant.\" He asked the Sergeant-Major to sit down, and he sat down right in front of the General. \"Have you eaten yet soldier?\" Nathan shook his head, the General turned to one of his Sergeant's. \"Sergeant, get this man a plate of dried beef and some coffee.\" The Line Sergeant saluted and went to get the food.\" \"Thank you General.\" The General shot a quick smile before returning to the paper he was writing on. \"Well Sergeant, us professional soldiers have to stay together, I was a Captain in the Second before the war actually.\" The two professional soldiers talked as they both ate and drank. But the Sergeant-Major saw that the General was writing a courier message to send to General Reynolds. General Reynolds, My troops are deployed on good ground west of Gettysburg on the Chambersburg Pike. I've sent reconnaissance parties out in every direction from which the enemy might attack, I'm satisfied that AP Hill's Corps, is massed just west of here back at Cashtown, enemy picketts four miles of my position, rumor says Ewell is coming over the mountains from Carlisle. If true two Confederate Corps will converge on us in the morning, one from the west and one from the north, do you want me to hold this position if attacked, confirmation requested. J. Buford The Sergeant-Major spoke up when he saw what the General was writing on the paper. \"Sir, do you think General Reynolds will get here tomorrow morning in time?\" The General looked at him and sighed. \"General Reynolds is a good man, but I don't know, hopefully the message will go up to General Meade, then up to Washington.\" The General stopped speaking for a moment. \"But the telegraph lines might not be repaired yet, and those Politicians in Washington must be screaming their heads off, damned Halleck.\" The Sergeant-Major nodded, he didn't approve of General Halleck, he had a personal reason for his hatred for the General. If Halleck had brought the Pontoons on scheduled to Fredericksburg, then his father might have not been killed there. He then noticed he was done eating and his cup of coffee was empty, and realized he had better get back to his Company. \"If we stack them up along that narrow it'll take them a while to get on track, to get into position, what do you think?\" The Sergeant-Major turned to respond. \"It's a sound move sir, we've got decent ground, we can fire our cannons down on them and almost triple their rate of fire with our Carbines.\" The General nodded, he was not a hard man, the Sergeant was right, he was a man who simply wanted to get the job done and nothing more. He then pulled out his watch and noted the time, Lt Carr would have his hide if he were any later than he already is. \"Thank you for everything sir, but I best be getting back now.\" The General shock hands with him and shot a quick smile. \"Be careful tomorrow, but don't get to confident.\" The Sergeant-Major cracked a smile and saluted the General before mounting his horse and going back to McPherson's Ridge. The General had made headquarters at the Seminary, and he would have a nice view from the Cupola for the fight tomorrow morning. He galloped back to the ridge and gave his horse to Miller again, Lt Carr was the first to approach him, and he didn't look happy. He approached the senior Non-Commissioned Officer with a scowl on his face. \"SERGEANT-MAJOR WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?!\" He was about to explain when he was cut off again by the Lieutenant. \"You've been assigned pickett duty tonight, you will be with the forward skirmishers if a battle does come tomorrow morning. You'll go down the road and find Trooper Ward just off the pike.\" Nathan Reynolds knew better to argue with Lt Carr, he merely saluted the Lieutenant and carried on. He again got his horse from Miller and road a few miles and found the post where Ward was camped. \"Who goes there?\" The Sergeant-Major went through the brush and waved at Ward who put down his gun. \"Good to see you Sergeant.\" Nathan tied his horse to the tree where Ward had tied his and unsaddled him. \"Sarge, will there be a fight tomorrow?\" The Sergeant-Major put down his saddle and grabbed his bedroll and was about to roll it out he gave Ward an answer. \"Probably, and we'll have to hold for a while, but we'll do it.\" He laid his head on the ground and looked up for a moment, again he thought the war was far away, but not that far, was the entire Army of Northern Virginia. Twenty-five hundred men against thousands of the enemy, but they would stand their ground, or he at least he would. \"Now ain't we glad we joined the Cavalry.\" The Sergeant-Major brought up his head. \"What do you mean?\" Ward looked over at him and gave a bit of a chuckling grin. \"We can get the hell out of here if Johnny Reb gets real close.\" That placed a smile on the face of Nathan Reynolds, and the two started to laugh, but it would be the last bit of laughing they did in a long while.[Chapter 2] As Trooper Ward slept, Sgt-Major Nathan Reynolds sat with his Carbine on a log, he cleaned the breech of his Carbine to make sure it would be ready for today's fight. He looked at his watch and saw that it was almost Seven, it had rained a bit that morning but the sky was clearing up and the sun was coming out. But as he was finishing up, he heard a faint noise, that he could only identify as footsteps, footsteps of troops marching, he looked straight over at Ward and shook him awake. Ward was about to shout his head off when he was shook awake by the Sergeant-Major told him to keep quiet and listen, the tow quickly broke their small camp, saddled their horses. But before they began to head back, the Sergeant-Major loaded his Carbine. Ward brought up his head and rubbed his eyes to see what the Sergeant-Major was doing \"What are you doing?\" The Sergeant-Major looked at him. \"This.\" He loaded the gun, brought it to full cock and pulled the trigger, firing the bullet into the air. \"I'm alerting the other picketts, we've all got to get moving back to hold the town.\" The two saddled their horses and proceeded back to Gettysburg as quickly as possible. They galloped down the Chambersburg Pike and found a small detachment of Dismounted Videttes from the 8th Illinois Cavalry at Herr's Tavern. They quickly rode to them to alert their commanding officer that Johnny Reb was coming down the road in force. They found a Sergeant and went to ask him who was in charge. \"Say Sergeant, who's in charge here?\" The Sergeant turned to look at the two. \"Lt Jones, why?\" The group of men here didn't even number half a platoon, thought Nathan to himself. \"Let him know he's got Rebs marching this way, and you boys might have first crack at them.\" He dismounted and got his Carbine, Ward was confused, they were supposed to report back as soon as possible. \"What are you waiting for Ward, get your Carbine and dismount, we're starting this battle from right here.\" Ward dismounted with his Carbine and knelt down by a rail fence with the Illinois Troopers in front of the white painted Tavern, then a Lieutenant walked up to the Sergeant and Sergeant-Major. \"What the devil is going on Sergeant Shafer?!\" The Sergeant saluted his superior, to which he returned it. \"Sir, this Sergeant-Major said he heard the Rebs marching this way, and was riding back to Gettysburg to warn the rest of the Division.\" The Lieutenant turned to the Sergeant-Major. \"Is this true Sergeant-Major?\" The Sergeant-Major nodded, and they both looked down the road, and sure enough, half a mile away was the Rebel column. One of the men brought up their carbine to fire, but the Lieutenant stopped them. \"Give me the honor of opening the Ball Trooper.\" He turned to Sgt Shafer. \"Sergeant, let me have your Carbine.\" Sgt Shafer handed his Carbine over to the Lieutenant, there was an officer on a white horse in front of the column of gray troops. He knelt by the fence and aimed down the sight of the weapon and squeezed the trigger. The officer was still on his horse, but they were out of range, explaining why the officer wasn't knocked off his horse. \"Looks like he's out of range Lieutenant.\" The Lieutenant nodded, then turned to the Sergeant-Major and Trooper Ward. \"You two better get back to your Regiment, we'll be right behind after we give these Rebs a volley.\" The two Regular Troopers did not have to be told twice, they immediately went to their horses and rode back to McPherson's Ridge. The men galloped another mile and a half back to their positions at McPherson's Ridge and soon were by the rail fence where their horses were being held, they gave their horses to one of the troopers and ran over to Capt Buckston and Lt Carr. \"You rode in here like a bat out of hell Sergeant-Major, what's going on?\" Nathan caught his breath from riding so hard back to their defense positions, he looked to see a battery of six 3-pounder ordnance guns were in place, with their limbers only a few feet behind hitched to their battery horses. \"Sir, we heard the Confederates marching down the road from the west, so we alerted the other pickett posts by firing a shot in the air, we rode down to the Herr Tavern finding a small contingent of men from the 8th Illinois, then came here immediately after.\" The Lieutenant and Captain looked at each other. \"Alright Sergeant-Major, you'll be in command of two squads of advanced skirmishers a few yards up on the slope of the ridge. Your responsible for delaying the Confederates as long as you can before pulling back here to the main line of defense.\" The Sergeant-Major saluted his commanding officer, and then ran towards his horse. He mounted his horse and rode down to another rail fence where the two squads were, he handed off his horse and ran down and knelt with the others and waited. But they didn't have to wait that long, for a Confederate Regiment was marching down the road right towards them. Meanwhile Up in the Cupola of the Seminary, General Buford and two other officers could see a Regiment of Infantry advancing with an officer on a white horse through his binoculars, Lt Calef's Battery was just getting the range, One of the shells went off in front of an officer on the horse and knocked him off, killing him in the process. The Regiment then pulled off the road and got onto the sloping ground at the bottom of the ridge, cannon shells exploding right in the middle of their ranks as they moved at the double quick to form a line of battle. Then came the fire from the men behind the rail fence and they began to open fire on them, the Rebs quickly formed into a line, but were still getting whittled down by relentless fire. The dismounted cavalrymen continued to fire, Troopers with Carbines and Officers with Pistols, he saw his forward skirmishers fall back to the main line and reinforce his main position. The Rebels fired their rifled muskets at the dismounted trooper, but as the lines on men continued to fall, they began to waver under the strain of the casualties. He watched as the Rebels attacked his position and grinned, the Rebs had no guns up yet and bringing a full Brigade up. \"He's got a Brigade in position and that's all, he hitting me with one Brigade and I'm dug in, lovely, lovely.\" General Buford then looked off to the Southeast for any sign of John Reynolds and his Corps, but saw nothing. \"Gentlemen, let's go down there.\" One of the officers opened a wooden hatch that revealed the stairs, they walked down to the bottom where the rest of the staff was waiting. He mounted his horse and started towards the defense with his staff and the Division color bearer carrying the Red and White 1st Cavalry Division Guidon right behind. The dismounted cavalrymen continued to fire on the Confederate Infantry, the cannons fired right into their lines and the casualties of the Graybacks were mounting, gun smoke gathering around the Union cannons and Carbines creating a mist in front of the defenders, the Confederates were ramming bullets down the barrels of their muskets when they began to break and run from the field. From his position on the line next to Calef's Battery, Col Gamble saw the Rebels begin to fall back. \"They're on the run.\" Just then, he saw General Buford and his staff riding down the pike and onto the field right towards him. Col Gamble saluted the General as he galloped up towards him. \"Quite a scrap, huh General.\" The General looked up at his Brigade Commander \"How are your loses?\" The General took a moment to look at the men and how they remained there waiting, some others were just getting back from their pickett positions, dismounting and running towards the main line to take positions with the other men in the Brigade. \"Not bad at all sir, we've really got a twist on them, they're arrogant people you know, they came right at us.\" The General looked through his binoculars to look out for more of the Rebs heading down the road to deploy in the field in front of them and their forward skirmishers. \"Listen we took some prisoners, they're from Heth's of Hill's Corps, that's what I've got in front of me.\" The General looked back at the Colonel and then back at the road as more Regiments arrived against his men. \"It's a new Division, I figure eight thousand men more or less, all within sound of this, just back up that road between here and Cashtown, just a little way's up the road.\" The General looked through his binoculars to see more Confederates moving down the road at the double quick. \"It'll take them a while to get on line.\" Col Gamble then looked over at the General and nodded. \"Yes sir, but, Hill's whole Corps is in front of me with twenty-five thousand, Longstreet behind that, Ewell over there to the North.\" Gen Buford continued to look through his binoculars as Gamble continued on. \"I know Colonel, I know.\" He looked back at his Brigade Commander and also noticed men rushing around on horseback, probably couriers, and other men holding the horses of the men that were dismounted and firing. \"The thing is this sir, when John Reynolds get's here he won't have the whole army with him, only part of it. The point is, as I see it, the Rebs will be here with everything they got, I just thought I'd mention it.\" The two looked down at the position of the men, another Confederate Regiment was on the run. \"Now, what do you want me to do here sir.\" The General turned to look at the Colonel. \"Well, Heth'll be back in a bit, if he's got any brain at all and he's not stupid, he's got to know by now he's got at least a Brigade in front of him. I don't think he'll wait to get his whole Division in line, that'll take half the morning.\" The Colonel looked over at the field where another Confederate Regiment was moving into line and back at the General \"Sir, he don't need his whole Division.\" Gen Buford looked at Gamble once again. \"That's right, does Devin report any activity on his front over to the right?\" The Colonel shook his head. \"No sir, not a lick.\" The General gave a small nod. \"Right, I'l have Devin leave a cover in the north, pull the rest of his boys out and move in alongside you, lengthening your line, when Heth get's back he'll find two Brigades instead of one, that ought to hold them until Reynolds get's here.\" Col Gamble gave a nod. Col Gamble: \"Right sir.\" He looked up at the sky. \"Hmm, damn sure glad the rain's gone, don't want anything to slow up Reynolds.\" Gen Buford looked back at his Brigade commander. \"Take care of yourself Colonel.\" Col Gamble smiled and saluted his commanding officer. \"Don't worry about me sir, I'm the soul of caution.\" The General returned the salute and rode off down the line, he quickly told a young Lieutenant to send a second message to General Reynolds. He knew that if Heth committed his whole force, they would roll over them, his entire Division would be lost as well as the high ground, and the only person to blame, would be him. But he had sounded the bugle, and could not call a retreat, he knew the way to Washington would be open if they ran. He stuck around the line and sent another courier to Devin to tell him to immediately come towards Gamble's position and dig in, but in the General's mind he thought 'If this was a mistake, God help us' . Meanwhile The men forward of the rail fence commanded by Sgt-Major Reynolds were holding fast, the two squads he was given gave him a total of sixteen men in a skirmish line five feet in between each trooper and kneeling. The men brought up their Carbines and aimed at the line of rebels marching their way, the men were slightly intimidated by the number of Rebs approaching them now then when they came the first time, but now they had reformed and more were coming in force. \"Ready!\" Shouted Reynolds, some of the troopers were shaking at the numbers of Confederate Infantry that were marching in line of battle towards them. \"Aim!\" The Rebel Skirmisher's were three deep and approaching them quickly, the cavalry skirmishers were already down to ten rounds per man, but they were Regulars, they wouldn't break and run. \" FIRE! \" A volley of fire from the .54 Caliber Sharps Carbines hit the middle of the line of an advancing Rebel Regiment and a good section of their front rank, killing a color bearer and two others of the color guard, and several other line infantrymen. The Sergeant-Major was about to give the order to reload and give another volley, when he saw a battery of Rebel Cannon in place and about to fire, they were exposed where they were, and the main line was only a few yards to the rear. \"ALRIGHT MEN, FALL BACK!\" The men stood up straight and ran to the rear, gripping the scabbards of their sabers so they wouldn't trip over them while running. Some of the men quickly reloaded their breech loading carbines while running, two men knelt down and got a shot off before being directly hit by an artillery shell. Nathan looked at their mangled bodies and was in shock, he turned and gave another volley, and realized his Carbine was not loaded, the other men were already ahead of him, some turned and fired before they were shot. He ran towards the fence, he could recognize Sgt Mulcahy waving toward him, he got to the fence and tossed over his Carbine to Mulcahy before jumping over the fence, be then, he felt something hit him just above his knee, like a bullet. He thought he was hit, right above his left knee. He felt no pain though, he didn't know whether that would be good or bad, he hit the dirt laid there for a minute or two, but the world seemed to slow down around him as he thought. No pain, but he felt something hit him, he started to check his left left leg and felt no bullet wound, no feeling of blood on his hand, nothing. He looked down, and saw a section of his scabbard was bent in. He pulled it up and saw a small round ding in it. \"NATHAN! Are You Alright!\" He showed his scabbard to Mulcahy who then looked him right in the eyes. \"Well I'll be damned.\" The Sergeant-Major whispered loudly, The two gave a chuckle before Mulcahy gave Reynolds his Carbine, they both got behind the wooden fence and opened fire again on the Rebels. The Confederates began to advance slowly, but the men kept up their fire, while the Rebels had muzzle-loaders, the Federals had Breech loaders, that almost tripled the amount of fire of the Rebs. But then the artillery rained in behind them at Lt Calef's guns, the blast of which knocked down a entire cannon crew but luckily didn't kill them. The Sergeant-Major fired another shot and reached back to his Cartridge box to pull out another round when he looked back and saw Col Gamble himself with a pistol firing on the Rebs from his horse. The Sergeant-Major got out a paper cartridge and pulled the forward the trigger guard to open the breech of the Carbine, he placed the cartridge in the breech and closed it, tearing off the end of the cartridge exposing the powder inside. He pulled back the hammer to half cock and took off an old percussion cap, he got a new cap from a small pouch on his belt and placed it on the cone. He brought the hammer to full cock and aimed at a Confederate Infantryman reloading his musket and fired, dropping the Rebel like a fly. He reached back for another cartridge but felt nothing in his cartridge box, it was empty, he had run out of ammunition. He quickly ran back over to his mount to get some more from his saddle bags when he heard an artillery shell fly overhead. He braced himself for the shock of the cannon blast which came, but it didn't do much damage, flew over a Gun and knocked off the right wheel of a Limber. But when he grabbed more cartridges and stuffed them into his cartridge box he looked at the Limber again and saw that it had caught fire, he knew that it was loaded to the brim with cannon shells and powder, and the artillery gun in front of him was manned by six men in the ten man crew of the 3-pounder, the blast from the limber would kill the men manning the gun. Something had come over him, he didn't know what he was doing as he was acting on impulse, but before heading back to his position, he dropped his Carbine and ran over to the gun crew waving his arms. \"GET AWAY FROM THAT GUN!\" The men looked over at him, confused, maybe they couldn't hear him, or maybe they did but didn't understand why he wanted them to move away. \"GET AWAY FROM THAT GUN!\" He pointed at the limber which was half engulfed in flames, the crew saw and immediately ran a few feet and hit the dirt. He looked back at the limber and saw that someone was on it, trying to get the battery horses to move the limber away, he immediately ran over to the limber and pushed the artilleryman off of it. He drew his saber and cut the reins before hitting the horses on their rear ends, making them bolt away towards the ordnance wagon. He then ran over to the artilleryman and helped him up, but he soon saw that almost the whole limber was aflame, he pushed down the artilleryman and he hugged the ground himself. They both heard the limber explode and stayed down as the wooden debris and shrapnel fragments fell around them, they both soon were helped up by other artillerymen, a Artillery Line Sergeant carried the Sergeant-Major's Carbine over to him and handed it to him, and took his right hand and shook it. \"Thanks friend, you saved our lives, if it weren't for you, we would have been gotten for sure.\" The Sergeant-Major tipped his Black Cavalry hat and immediately ran back up to the line. As he moved up, he heard someone shouting over behind him, and saw a whole Brigade take up position over near their position and to the right. \"FORM BATTLE LINES, GIVE'EM HELL!\" He saw the men run forward towards the fences and then saw a high ranking officer get off his own horse and draw his saber, and he saw that it was Colonel Devin and his Brigade. He soon got back to his Company on the line and resumed firing, he then saw Capt Buckston run over to him wit his Colt Revolver in his right hand. \"Sergeant-Major, keep up the...\" He was cut off by a bullet hitting him in the throat, and was bleeding as he hit the ground. \"Captain!\" He lunged over to help the Captain and saw where he was bleeding. \"STRETCHER BEARER!\" He looked around, no one heard him. \" STRETCHER BEARER! \" A medical orderly ran over to him and looked at the Captain, he was dead. Many thoughts went through his mind, especially what had happened the last time one of his officer's were killed, he thought of Capt McCord and how he had survived while several others didn't. He thought about his friends he had made before Gen Stoneman's raid into Virginia, his father who dies at Fredericksburg the year prior, he thought about how many people he cared for that this cruel war would take. \"Sergeant-Major, take your position and fire your weapon.\" He had not noticed Lt Carr standing over him with a pistol in his left hand, he was angry and sweaty from the gunsmoke and heat. \"I said, take your place on the firing line, THAT'S AN ORDER!\" The Sergeant-Major didn't listen, he stayed where he was, he didn't notice how Lt Carr aimed his pistol at the back of his head before an explosion behind them. Lt Carr was now rolling around on the ground, Shrapnel in his right leg, it had kept Nathan Reynolds from being killed, but also, had placed him in command. Another medical orderly had gotten a stretcher and with another man's help, carried the Lieutenant off the field. He then heard something that put fear into every soldier wearing the army blue, the Rebel yell. He saw the Rebels's coming closer and closer and the men were beginning to get nervous, the Sergeant-Major saw one man was about to break and run but he quickly ran towards him and caught him before he slipped away. The scared trooper had dropped his Carbine and Nathan picked it up. He opened the breech, pulled out a cartridge and helped the trooper load it, he then turned him around and got him back on the firing line, he picked up his own Carbine and waited for the Rebs to get so close they wouldn't miss. \"Ready.\" The men made sure the hammer's of their Carbines were at full cock. \"Aim.\" Some held the Carbine by the steel barrel, others by the wooden stock at the front, and others rested it on the fence. \" FIRE! \" The men all fired at once and the Rebs fell like dominoes, but they were still coming, so the men reloaded their weapons and fired again, and again, until the Rebs started to slowly fall back to reform once again. Meanwhile \"That flank, Hold it!\" The General saw Devin's Brigade move in and take a position on the flank next to Gamble's Brigade. \"STAND FAST, KEEP UP YOUR FIRE, POUR IT INTO THEM BOYS, POUR IT INTO THEM!\" His men soon knelt behind the fence and opened fire on the advancing Rebels. General Buford moved down the line with his staff behind him, he then saw a Captain ride up towards him and saluted. \"Gamble's down sir, Colonel Gamble, but he's not hurt bad sir!\" The General quickly trotted over to where Col Gamble was, he and two aides were dusting him off. \"I'm alright, I'm alright.\" he looked over at the General. \"Close, that's all.\" The General shook his head with a grin as Col Gamble mounted his horse again, he looked through his binoculars again. He didn't notice and officer, a young First Lieutenant, and an older possibly in his early 40's Line Sergeant ride up to him and his staff, until he spoke. \"Sir!\" The General put down his binoculars and looked at the Lieutenant who gave him a salute, he immediately returned it. \"Col Devin's compliments, there was a problem on the right, they came up close, we put in the reserve, but we didn't put it all in sir, he wishes to know if you have any further orders.\" The General took a short pause that seemed longer than it was, and thought about Devin's situation, they had not broken through, but they came close to breaking. \"Tell Devin all reserve forward, NOW!\" The Lieutenant saluted the General and took off with the Sergeant right behind him, leaving General Buford and his staff to watch the line. He looked through his binoculars yet again and could see Devin waving his saber, having the men keep up their fire on the Rebels lines of Infantry. Artillery is traded between both North and South as Lt Calef's Battery continues to fire on the Rebel Infantry and the Confederate Batteries fire on the dismounted Cavalrymen and their horse artillery. The General see's one Company from the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry galloping back towards the main defense line behind the fence, while Confederate Artillery rained around them. Once behind the slight safety of the fence, the men dismounted, filling any gaps in the line and started to blaze away with their Carbines. One shell knocked of a horse holder from his own mount and caused his mount to run off a few feet, while the other mounts merely stood there. The General had decided to go back to the Seminary to check for Reynolds, but when he looked to the south, there was nothing, sign of Gen Reynolds. He looked again to the West, the men were battered and bruised, but not beaten, but ammunition was beginning to run low within the ranks, little to nothing in the ordnance wagons. Yet he still saw the guidons of different companies of different regiments continue to wave, then he heard something from one of the officers that he thought he would never hear. \"Sir, It's General Reynolds!\" He quickly turned his head and looked through his binoculars to see General Reynolds and his staff cutting across fields and farms, moving toward the Seminary. Gen Buford smiled and took out a handkerchief to wipe his eyes. \"Thank god.\" Soon enough, Gen Reynolds was right below the Cupola, one man was holding the Colors of the 1st Corps and the rest of the men were his staff officers. \"What goes John?\" General Reynolds looked up at General Buford and General Buford looked down at General Reynolds. \"There's a Devil to Pay.\" General Reynolds cupped his left hand around his mouth and shouted up to Gen Buford. \"Can you hold?\" The General looked to the west again to see his two Cavalry Brigades fighting Confederate Infantry, battered and bruised but still fighting on, he looked down at Reynolds again. \"I reckon I can.\" One of the General's Staff officer opened the hatch in the floor and started to walk down to General Reynolds, as General Reynolds gave orders to his staff officers. General Reynolds wheeled his horse to face the officers on his staff. \"Captain, you will ride as fast as you can to General Meade, tell him the enemy is advancing in strong force and I'm afraid they will make it to the heights beyond the town before we will. We'll fight them here, inch by inch through the town if necessary.\" The Captain saluted and rode off south towards Taneytown, Maryland. The General then turned to a Lieutenant and gave him a set of orders. \"Lieutenant, go into town, tell the people to stay in off of the streets, especially children, there's liable to be a a fair sight in this feud here today.\" Like the Captain before him the Lieutenant saluted and rode towards the town. General Reynolds then turned to an officer with glasses filthy as a dirt road. \"Joe, how can you see anything with those things on?\" The officer quickly took off his glasses and began to clean them with his blouse. General Reynolds walked his horse forward as General Buford came outside, Buford saluted Reynolds and Reynolds returned the salute before dismounting, the two shaking hands. \"General, damn glad to see you.\" Reynolds grinned. \"The First Corps' coming up, the Eleventh is right behind.\" He pointed at the Emmitsburg Road and Gen Buford could see the column of Infantrymen marching down the road, the Black Hat boys, the Iron Brigade. A crack Brigade of Westerners from Wisconsin, Indiana and Michigan under Gen Meredith. General Reynolds then looked at General Buford again and smiled \"Good job John.\" The Cavalry officer gave a small smile \"Thank you, I don't think they knew until now what they were up against, now that your here they still won't know.\" The Corps Commander gave of a slightly cocky grin. \"Then they'll be coming back, very good, Heth will come in here thinking he up against two tired Cavalry Brigades, instead he'll be hitting two Corps of Fresh Union Infantry.\" General Buford smirked. \"Yes sir, poor Harry.\" \"You can pull your boys out as soon as we set up, put them out on my flanks, good cavalry on both flanks.\"Gen Buford nodded. \"Yes sir. Well John, most of my life I've been leery of the appearance of high command, John I sure am glad to see you.\" Gen Buford went over to his staff to get his horse, and Gen Reynolds looked at his staff. \"Gentlemen, place the troops!\" The two rode down to the west where Gen Buford's Cavalry was engaged in the fighting, even if just barley through the smoke and gunfire, the two old soldiers talked on their way down, with the sound of Infantry marching behind them. \"Now John, Heth probably has ten thousand men coming down that road, have you sited?\" Gen Buford nodded. \"Yes sir, and there'll be a lot more behind him.\" Gen Reynolds looked back at the men marching forward and then back to the field/ \"We we have about twenty thousand we can put in the field, we're in very good shape I think.\" General Buford agreed. \"For a while sir.\" \"I'm sending messages to all my commanders to come to this place with all possible speed.\" Gen Reynolds looked at the ground for a moment or two. \"Lovely ground.\" Gen Buford looked at it himself, he had made the right decision. \"I thought so sir.\" Gen Reynolds face Buford. \"Now let's go surprise Harry Heth.\" The two General and their Staffs galloped down there, with the first columns of Infantry Regiments marching down the road, soon Reynolds took off to hurry the Infantry along to relieve Buford. The General soon went back over to the field to see how the men were holding up close once more, and to pull the men out as soon as the Infantry had set up. Later At this point, he was leading the men and keeping them firing, Sgt-Major Nathan Reynolds had his saber drawn and was firing with his pistol, like many an officer on the line. His Carbine on his sling and the ammunition on his person given to a trooper who needed it, he walked back and fourth down the line of his Company, which was not in the best shape. Two officers killed, as well as twenty-nine enlisted men, twenty-four Privates, three Corporals, a line Sergeant, and a bugler were killed in the fight, and twelve other men wounded leaving him with fifty-seven men under him, a non-commissioned officer. But the men did as they were told by him and kept up there fire, but ammunition was running low, the men were down to fifteen rounds a man, even from what they got off the dead and wounded, it still wouldn't be enough. The ordnance wagons were already running dangerously low, soon the men would have to fight with their sabers and rocks, but the men noticed something, the men to their left were not Cavalry, but Infantry, then the Sergeant-Major looked behind and saw more men moving at the double=quick were Infantry. The men didn't show it, but they were relieved and ecstatic, they had held on for General John Reynolds and the Infantry to arrive, the men continued fighting on, with even more confidence than they had before, they weren't going to leave yet. Then the Sergeant-Major saw an officer, a Captain ride over to Gen Buford who was dismounted with his Division Color bearer and staff around him looking through his binoculars. He could just barely hear what they were saying, but it was clear enough. The Captain handed one of the General's staff officers a note, who read it back to the General. \"Sir, Compliments of Colonel Devin, Rebels are coming down the road from the north, he asks for instructions sir.\" The men the General had left in the north had seen the Rebel advance by Ewell's Corps, one Regiment would not hold for long. \"That'll be Ewell's Corps, trying to flank us, we've got to met him, force him to go on line.\" He turned to the mounted Captain. \"Seek Col Devin, tell him to get up that way as quick as he can, we'll get Gamble's boys back in the saddle and be there shortly.\" The Captain saluted and rode off, as more Infantry moced down the line, now they were going to replace the Sergeant-Major's position as an officer walked up to him \"Who's in charge of these men?\" The Sergeant-Major saluted. \"I am, our officers were...\" The Infantry Captain cut him off. \"I don't want your life's story, just get these men out of here and make room for us, we're taking over!\" After hearing that, the Sergeant-Major got what was left of the men, off of the line to make room for the Infantry. He told the men to get their mounts and wait for him, he returned his saber to his scabbard and his pistol to his holster and quickly jogged over to Gen Buford. One of the General's officer's noticed him tried to stop him, but he went straight to Gen Buford. \"General Buford sir.\" He saluted his Division commander. \"Request permission to take B Company of the 2nd United States Cavalry, to the north, in support of Col Devin.\" He looked straight at the General. \"Aren't you the Sergeant-Major I spoke with last night?\" Nathan Reynolds quietly nodded. \"What about your officers trooper?\" The Sergeant-Major managed to keep his bearing when he mentioned his deceased officer, and a wounded one. \"One dead, the other badly injured, and we're just barely above half strength, but our spirit's are high.\" The General nodded and looked directly at the battle weary Sergeant-Major. \"Permission granted.\" The Sergeant-Major saluted the General who returned it and quickly ran over to his own Company, where Sgt Festus Mulcahy held his horse. \"Where to Nathan?\" The Sergeant-Major turned to him. \"North, to the Carlisle Turnpike, we're going to help Devin's boys.\" Mulcahy and others within earshot heard what he had said and were in surprise. \"What, but why?!\" The Sergeant-Major merely looked at him and gave him a simple response. \"We're in the army Festus, and this is what we get paid thirteen dollars a month for.\" He looked back at the other men and gave the order to march. \"FORWARD, AT THE GALLOP, HO!\" The men galloped in a ragged column of twos with their Company Guidon fluttering in the wind as they moved east back into the town before heading north. The men galloped hard and were soon on the line with Col Devin's men, who were also running low on ammunition, the men quickly dismounted and took their position holding back the Rebs, they were in a skirmish line with other New York Regiments who were surprised to see a Company of Regulars fight with them, but were glad nonetheless. The forward Brigade videttes had fallen back behind the skirmish line and left the rest up to the men of the 2nd Brigade, even though ammunition was low, the men managed to hold on for more than an hour. Soon enough, the men of the Eleventh Corps under General Carl Schurz took over, allowing the cavalrymen to mount up and ride to the rear towards the hill to the south. The men soon found themselves with Col Gamble's Brigade and the rest of the Division when they reached the hill with the cemetery, they finally felt as if they could breath after holding the enemy all morning. Their job was done, for now, but soon, by late afternoon, the men heard that the army was in retreat through the town, how the Eleventh Corps broke and caved in on the flank of the First Corps. It was Chancellorsville all over again with the German soldiers of the Eleventh Corps running again from the fight. Now they heard that the First Corps was now on the run, and that General Reynolds was killed and General Doubleday had replaced him in command of the Corps. The men were both mounted and dismounted, scattered fighting had happened with both Brigades as they moved to the rear and flanks, battered, bruised, and exhausted the men began to rest, now a Staff Officer from Doubleday rode up and could be seen by the men of the Regular Cavalry, he rode up to Gen Buford at the base of the hill with the cemetery. \"General Buford sir, General Doubleday has asked me to tell you to do anything you can to stop the pursuit of the Rebels against the First Corps, so the men can deploy on the ridge next to this hill without fear of being attacked.\" The General looked tired, stressed, and above all else, quite a bit angry, he pointed to the men of Hill's Corps on the Ridge with the Seminary. \"WHAT IN HELL AND DAMNATION DOES HE THINK I CAN DO AGAINST THOSE LONG LINES OF THE ENEMY!?\" He rode off toward Gamble's position and some of the men remounted, including the Regulars, and followed him to the high ground to the west. The men were just beyond rifle range of the Confederates, when the General gave the order that no one thought he would give that day. It was to draw sabers, the men did as they were told, but to charge into that line of men would have been suicide, but the order to charge didn't come. \"What's the General waiting for, are we gonna charge or not?!\" Asked Quincannon, the Sergeant-Major looked down the line, he knew what the General was doing, it looked like they were going to charge, but they weren't. \"It's a faint.\" His friends, Sergeants Mulcahy, O'Ryan, and Quincannon looked at him is confusion. \"He's tricking the Rebs into thinking we're gonna charge, but we're not, we're stalling for time. It's a faint.\" The men were amazed at the strategy choice of the General, and also relieved. The action had the effect the General had hoped for, it had stopped the Rebs, forcing them to brace themselves for a mounted attack to their front which never came. They waited there until the men of the First Corps where on Cemetery Ridge, soon, Gen Buford gave the order to counter march back towards back towards Cemetery Hill, showing enough might and menace to make the Ridge beyond the town secure. General Hancook of the Second Corps of the Army of the Potomac, later called that the most daring sights he had seen in the entire war.[Chapter 3] It was late in the evening, the men were resting in a Peach Orchard to the south near two round rocky hills, on the far left of the Union line, some of the men rested their heads on their saddles and tried to sleep. Other's had gotten some of the peaches from the peach trees and bit into the juicy fruit of the summer season. The men of B Troop of the United States Second Cavalry were in their own circle away from the other Regiments, some of the men were already asleep once the sun set and the moon came out. But four Irish Non-commissioned officers were still awake, going over who was dead, wounded, or missing, and counting up the remaining men. \"What about Martin, how is he?\" He looked at Sgt O'Ryan, for he was with Martin in his section. \"He's fine, almost caught a bullet, but it just grazed him on the left side of his head, we tied it up with a bandage.\" The Sergeant-Major nodded, then Sgt Mulcahy spoke up. \"Nathan, can I say something, off the record.\" The Sergeant-Major looked at his friend. \"You did all a man could do and more today, and I know your father would be proud to hear of you commanding a body of men today.\" The Sergeant-Major nodded, he hadn't thought of his father all day and he looked up at the sky. It was almost as if he see his father's face, hear his voice, speaking to him from heaven. He merely sat there and thought of the days before the passing of his late father, he remembered how they talked about their shared experiences on the battlefield at home, in some cases they were only a few miles apart from each other. He remembered the family photo that they had taken with his mother and younger brother of two years. He wondered what his own family was up to as he sat on this very field, where two armies dueled for dominance of the field, and were surely to continue in the morning. He laid his head down in the grass and waited for his exhaustion to take over and wait until tomorrow, until he was called by someone with a thick Irish Accent. \"Sgt-Major Nathan Reynolds, I'm looking for Sgt-Major Nathan Reynolds!\" The Sergeant-Major quickly got up and ran over to the sound of the voice calling him. \"I'm Sgt-Major Nathan Reynolds.\" The man in question appeared to be a Captain, with a full mustache and short chin beard. \"I'm Captain Myles Keogh, aide to General Buford, he would like to see you immediately.\" The Sergeant-Major nodded and turned back over to the others. \"MULCAHY!\" The older Line Sergeant sat up and looked at the Sergeant-Major. \"Your in charge until I return.\" The Sergeant just nodded and went back to laying down in the ground. The two walked over to the horses and saddled up, and rode to the northeast where they could both see the Division Colors and a small clump of men. It was General Buford and his staff, Captain Keogh led him up to the General and saluted him. \"Sir, Sgt-Major Reynolds of the 2nd Cavalry.\" The Sergeant-Major saluted the General, he returned the salute of both the Captain and Sergeant-Major, the Captain when back within the ranks and left the two at the front of the staff. \"You know Sergeant-Major, I saw and heard about what you did today, and I'm quite impressed.\" The Sergeant-Major was grateful for the praise, but didn't let it overcome him. \"I want you to ride with us to Headquarters, General Hancock would probably like to see you.\" The Sergeant-Major nodded, they started to trot to the north, towards the hill with the cemetery again, he was behind General Buford and next to the Color Bearer, holding the white and red division guidon. He himself was once a color bearer, holding a similar flag, though it was for one Company and not a whole Division. \"Is something bothering you friend?\" The Sergeant-Major quickly looked over to the color bearer, he had a thick yet small mustache, and a floppy forage cap on his head. The top three buttons of his shell jacket were unbuttoned and he appeared weary. \"No, nothing's bothering me, it's just, I was looking at the flag is all, it reminded me of another time.\" The Color Bearer looked confused, until Nathan Reynolds explained. \"I used to be a Color Bearer myself, early in the war, Bull Run and half of the Peninsula Campaign.\" The soldier seemed to understand now, and made a gesture that the Sergeant-Major would be grateful for. \"Want to hold it?\" He immediately looked at the trooper, and gave a nod, he subtly handed the flagpole over to the Sergeant-Major who held it with pride. He remembered the 1st Battle of Bull Run when he was with Custer, then the Peninsula with McCord, before he got his Sergeant-Major stripes. His mind went blank with the thought of those times, they were wonderful and frightful at the same time, he remembered the bullets whizzing by his head. It was a prize when you knocked down a soldier with a flag in his hands, but he was lucky, and at that moment, there was no gunfire, no cannon roars, no of battle, just the sound of hooves against the earth. He then heard someone gallop next to him and it was Capt Keogh, he looked at him and gave a firm yet warm smile. \"You've been the talk of the entire staff you know.\" The Sergeant-Major looked at him with a bit of slight confusion. \"Saving an Artillery crew, commanding a Company on your own, and volunteering them to assist Devin, you've made these officers hear everything they've ever had to.\" \"I... I just did what I thought was the right I didn't even think twice, I just acted.\" The Captain nodded. \"You did do what was right.\" He then went back to his spot in the ranks, and without another word, they carried on. General Buford just needed orders for him and his battered Division, the Sergeant-Major could sense his tiredness and stress, it must have been tough all day for him, especially after the death of General Reynolds. They soon came upon a small white farmhouse, and could see Regiments of Infantry and Batteries of Artillery arrived throughout the night. The General dismounted and asked the Sergeant-Major to follow him, he gave the Division Guidon back to the color bearer and followed the General, as if he was his pet aide. The two soon came across a Major who appeared to know his business and asked him who was in charge. \"Who's in command, and where do I find him?\" The Major turned to the pair and saluted. \"Good evening sir, the officer in command is General Howard and he can be found...\" He was interrupted by another Major. \"Oh NO EDGAR!\" He turned to the General. \"The officer in command is General Hancock sir, and he...\" The first Major butt in now and the two began to argue about who was the senior officer on the field, soon enough, other officers joined in the argument. \"Seem's we won't be getting any answers out of them.\" The General looked at the Sergeant-Major and nodded in agreement. \"And if Howard is in command sir, god help us.\" Neither appeared to have any admiration for the man, his Corps had run away again, just as they did at Chancellorsville, and Oliver Howard always found someone to blame other than himself. The two then noticed a figure, unfamiliar to the Sergeant-Major, but familiar to Buford was General John Gibbon, an old friend from out west. \"Evening John.\" The two officers shook hands. \"Surprised you could find headquarters, what with all that confusion.\" Gen Buford nodded, before remembering something he heard from before the war. \"Old Indian saying, follow the cigar smoke and find the fat man there.\" General Gibbon chuckled as they walked up the stone path towards the small white farmhouse, he then noticed the Sergeant-Major. \"Is this one of your new aides John?\" Gen Buford looked over at the Sergeant-Major. \"More like a one man army.\" He turned to the Sergeant-Major. \"Sgt-Major Reynolds, meet General John Gibbon.\" The two shook hands and soon continued to walk down the path. \"Who's in command here anyway.\" Gibbon shrugged \"You have your choice, General Howard or General Hancock, if you want to speak with Win, he's inside.\" General Winfield Scott Hancock was the commander of the Second Corps of the Army of the Potomac, he had been sent personally by Meade to overlook the situation after Reynolds was killed, but it was a verbal order, and General Howard could only be relieved by a written order from Meade. \"I need to get my Brigades refitted, all I want is orders.\" The two walked into the small house, passing two sentries who presented arms to the General officers. The young Non-Commissioned Officer had only seen a glimpse of headquarters life since the Second Cavalry acted as part of the Provost Guard during the Peninsula, with McClellan commanding at the time. Both General Buford and Sgt-Major Reynolds could spot General Hancock straight away smoking a cigar, and he turned to them and walked towards the General. \"How are you John?\" The two shook hands. \"Alright, Brigades are pretty shot up though, they need to get refitted.\" General Hancock nodded. \"Right, I'll see too it, we heard about what you did this morning, that was one hell of a piece of soldiering.\" As they were talking, Nathan looked around, he had never seen so many officers, some sitting, some standing, one on the bed in the room. Most of them smoking cigars, Infantry Officers, Artillery Officers, Ordnance, and Engineers were here. \"Thank you sir.\" General Hancock took another puff from his cigar. \"I heard you were with John Reynolds when he was killed, I'm sending the body up to his folks in Lancaster, they might appreciate a note from you.\" The General nodded. \"I'll send it.\" The General then seemed to notice the young Cavalry NCO and asked about him to Gen Buford. \"Say John, who's the young Sergeant?\" At the word Sergeant, Nathan quickly turned to face the General. \"Well General, this is Sergeant-Major Reynolds of the 2nd Cavalry, his company was with one of Gamble's Regiment's today, and he and some of the men with him fought like the devil to hold their ground.\" The Sergeant-Major merely stood at attention, until Gen Hancock put out his hand. \"A pleasure Sergeant-Major.\" The Sergeant-Major and Major General shook hands and the General continued to speak. \"So, your the one that I heard of that saved an artillery crew and lead an entire Company after your officers were killed.\" \"It was more as, what was left of a Company after one officer killed, the other seriously wounded.\" The General nodded with an amused grin before turning back to General Buford. \"Where do you want me in the morning?\" Now, General Hancock got more serious. \"I want you to hold your position on the extreme left, get some rest if you can, we may need you in the morning, JEB Stuart is still prowling out there someplace.\" The General nodded. \"Yes sir.\" The General and Sergeant-Major saluted General Hancock, and walked out of the small house. The two slowly walked down the stone path gripping their saber scabbards and passing the sentries, they walked over to a fence and leaned on them, looking at the ground. They could see men digging in and placing artillery batteries across the ground, neither spoke, and they were both exhausted, if they wanted to they could have fallen asleep right there. \"Well General Reynolds, we held the high ground.\" The Sergeant-Major looked over at the General and then spoke up. \"It's a mixed up business.\" The General looked at him. \"This whole thing.\" The General looked up with a bit of intrigue. \"How so?\" Nathan looked at his commanding officer, and gave him his response. \"Well, for one thing we're all american on both sides, now we're fighting each other because the south couldn't get John C Breckenridge into the President's office.\" The General sighed, he agreed with what Nathan had just said. \"Let me tell you something Sergeant-Major.\" The Sergeant-Major now looked over at the General. \"I asked you to accompany me here because, I needed someone to talk to after this whole thing.\" The Sergeant-Major was slightly puzzled. \"What about your aides sir, the two Lieutenants on your staff, your Sergeant?\" The General shook his head. \"The Lieutenants are dead, and Sgt Coarse is badly wounded, but I asked for you for a particular reason.\" The Sergeant-Major stayed silent. \"You a Regular. Now let me ask you a question, how long did you think this war would last at the beginning?\" He knew from when he arrived in Washington in 1861 that the conflict wouldn't be a three month skirmish, he knew how it would be, intimate and ugly. \"I don't know, but certainly not three months, before 1st Bull Run, I heard men talking about how we would be in Richmond before the month was out, I knew that was a load of hogwash. A half-trained, civilian mob of Militia and Ninety day enlistees couldn't whip anyone, not even a plow horse.\" \"It's been two years now.\" The General sighed, and so did the Sergeant-Major. \"And there's no end in sight.\" Without another word, the two walked back over to their mounts, and rode back to their position by the Peach Orchard to the south. The next morning, they would be pulled out of the line to refit and guard the supply trains for the army. If it wasn't for General Buford and his Cavalry, the Battle of Gettysburg would have ended in disaster for the Union, it may had not even happened. To this, we owe thanks to General John Buford and his 1st Cavalry Division, Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac.

The Yankee militia was strung out along the fence. Waiting. They had a few cannons, and only a 'couple o' hundred men. We can take em' thought Jonathan, fingering his rifle's stock. General Heth had orders not to engage, but it was only a few militia. He called over one of his aides. The aide was a short man from South Carolina. \"Major, tell General Archer to attack, this won't take but a minute.\" Ordered General Heth. The Major turned and galloped away. General Heth rode back along the column that was his division, all the way back to his artillery. Jonathan was getting impatient, what was taking so long for General Heth to attack? We could take em' he thought again. Just then the Artillery opened up and a courier rode up to General Archer, Jonathan was to far away to hear what was being said, but he knew that General Heth was going to send the Brigade in! \" Battalion!\" shouted theColonel. The men echoed. \"ATTENTION!\" The Regiment snapped to attention. \"Shoulder!\" Once again the men echoed. \"ARMS!\" In a ripple of motion every man in the regiment set his rifle against his shoulder. \" Forward!\" The men echoed, they were ready to attack. \"MARCH!\" As one the Brigade stepped off. Down the road the Yankees were prepping their guns. Jonathan realized that they would have to form up in the open field, in range of the enemy guns. There was no room to do it here. Jonathan's regiment was in the lead of the brigade, marching toward the enemy, A savage pleasure rose in his chest. They were finally attacking, and this could very well be the last battle in the war, in fact Jonathan was sure it was. Soon the union artillery opened up, spewing shells and round shot at General Archer's brigade. The projectiles whistled over Jonathan's head, he still believed that this would be an easy fight. A second volley from the union batteries mostly missed, whining away into the trees behind Jonathan, exploding far away, but one shell hit right in front of the first rank in the column. The first rank had only just enough time to stare, horrified at the shell lying there, freezing in mid step, before it exploded. The men were ripped apart, throwing a shower of blood and horrifying chunks of man through the air. Jonathan shied away from the blast, the smell of the burnt powder rolled over him, the scent of blood chocking him, but he still marched. \" At the double quick!\" Shouted the mounted colonel, raising his sword. \"MARCH!\" He yelled bring the sword down and spurring his horse. The Brigade began to double quick, almost but not quite running toward the enemy. The cannon fired again. Jonathan briefly saw a cruel black sphere before it roared down the line, the displaced air nearly spinning him around, a very near miss. The colonel was not so lucky, a shell burst in front of his horse knocking it to the ground and sending him tumbling out of his saddle. He did not get up. The men ran on, quickly climbing over the fence that lined the side of the road and forming a line in the field. The union militia, were not militia, that much Jonathan could instantly see from the uniforms, it was dismounted Calvary! Jonathan was in the first rank, the line had not fully assembled yet when the union troops and the fence vanished in a wall of smoke and fire. Jonathan felt a bullet fly not six inches from his face, saw the man next to him lose his face to a Minnie ball, as well as the back of his head, but Jonathan was untouched. \"Fire at will!\" yelled an officer. Jonathan raised his rifle, aimed at the smoke ahead of him and fired. His view instantly dissolved into smoke and the rifle kicked his shoulder. Jonathan heard the whiz of a bullet, then a wet thwack, then a blood-curdling scream, saw a dark shape fall, then some of the smoke lifted. Jonathan set his rifle's butt on the ground, and took a cartridge from his pouch, tore it and poured the powder into the muzzle, then placed the bullet in as well. As he drew his rammer an artillery shell burst in the air near by, showing Jonathan with tiny hot fragments that tore at his face, leaving small scratches. Jonathan kept loading, ramming the bullet home, most of the smoke was gone by the time he retuned the rammer to it's place, and Jonathan could aim clearly for his next shot. Surveying the men in front of him, Jonathan selected his target, a young private, almost standing, hardly behind cover at all. By this time he had his new cap on the nipple of his musket. Sighting as best he could Jonathan fired. The round blew up a cloud of sprinters as it struck near the youthful cavalryman's hand. The boy for the shooter, saw Jonathan standing fifty yards away. Then he raised his carbine and fired. Jonathan heard the bullet strike, felt a wetness spread down his leg, he swore as he twisted his head to look. The bullet had torn his trouser's leg and the leg underneath was bleeding. But most of the wetness was from the hole in the bottom of his canteen, not the gash in his leg. Jonathan was in pain, but he could handle it, he reached for another cartridge. As he reloaded the union Calvary fired another volley, and Jonathan saw several more men topple forward, blood staining the grass. As Jonathan finished reloading he heard his Captain yell: \" Company!\" \"CHARGE!\" Jonathan ran forward with his company. The Yankees fired another volley, striking the man on Jonathan's right. He collapsed in a bloody heap screaming. The fence was only fifty feet away. A cannon roared and canister shot clipped the flank of the company, killing the 1st Lieutenant and two other men. The fence was only twenty feet away. Jonathan stopped aimed at the youth that shot him, and fired. The ball struck the boy in the chest, he fell backward out of sight, blood spraying in a glistening fountain, staining the fence a deeper brown color. Without brothering to re-load Jonathan leapt over the fence and swung his rifle at a Yankee corporal. The corporal ducked and struck Jonathan in the chest with his carbine, knocking Jonathan back. Jonathan landed on the fence and collapsed it, feeling the blood of the young private seep into his uniform. The corporal was still coming. Jonathan staggered to his feet. This time he stabbed at the union soldier. The bayonet pierced the corporal's stomach. The stood stuck on the bayonet for a second then, with blood dribbling out of his mouth fell backwards arms limp, he struck his head on the dead privates carbine and did not move again. Jonathan staggered backward horrified at the carnage he dealt, the men he killed. Looking around he saw only a few of his company still standing. A bugle blew, signaling a retreat. Jonathan turned and ran from the fence. Bullets flew past him, but he barely noticed them. He mind was stuck seeing the corporal's last moments, again and again stabbing he, felling the blood on his face, again and again seeing the wound in his flesh, again and again hearing the god-awfully sound of his flesh tearing as he fell off the bayonet. Again and Again.[Chapter 2] Gettysburg: July 1stn1863 8:30 AM General Heth of ThenConfederate army of Northern Virginia was angry, his subordinate,nGeneral Archer had failed to take the town, even though it was onlynlightly defended by militia. General Heth had onlynjust spotted General Archer coming back to report. He better have angood excuse this time. \"Sir\" said GeneralnArcher as he rode up saluting. General Heth returnednthe salute, saying nothing. \"Sir, it wasndismounted Calvary, Sir, the put up a really good fight, Sir\" \"General Archer, hownmany of my men did you just waste?\" \"Sir, I don't knownwhat you're talking about!\" \"General Archer, hownmany men!\" \" Well sir… um thenfigures are 32 men dead, and another 54 wounded\" \"Reform yournbrigade, this time you will take that fence!\" orderednGeneral Heth \"Yes sir!\" GeneralnArcher rode away. Jonathan's leg wasnstarting to pain him badly. He tore a strip from his shirt and rappednit tightly around the gash in his leg. He had made that Yankee pay,nonce again he saw himself shoot that boy, saw him spin, saw the bloodnfountain through the air, watched the youth die. After the charge endednthe brigade fell back to the trees, now they had re-formed and wereneager to attack again. Jonathan's company had been shattered inntheir solo charge. Now Jonathan had been assigned to the 8th Company,nright in the middle of the regiment. This time the man inncharge of the regiment was the lieutenant-colonel, the colonel wasnlying in the road a few hundred yards down, next to his dead horse,nequally dead. However when the orders came to attack the courier wasnthe same. As were the orders, General Heth was a stubborn man. Battalion!\" shouted thelieutenant-colonel. \"ATTENTION!\" The Regiment snappednto attention. \"Shoulder!\" \"ARMS!\" Every man in thenregiment set his rifle against his shoulder, this time with slightlynless enthusiasm than last time. \" Forward!\" \"MARCH!\" The regiment set off,ndown the road again, towards the enemy. This time both side'snartillery opened up, shells flew at the Yankee fence, exploding innthe air, sending cruel fragments into the union cavalry. But thenUnion guns were firing to. As the brigade oncenagain went down the road the first shells struck the column, killingnseveral men, leaving bloodstains on the road. In this assault thenBrigade left the road earlier than last time, out of range of thenunion troops and their carbines. The line was formed without thenchaos of musketry killing men as they got into position. The Brigade, now in anbattle line, set off again, only fifty yards until they were innrange. A shell burst, killing three men down the line from Jonathan.nThe smell of burnt powder once again washed over Jonathan, stingingnhis nostrils. Thirty yards to go. A shell flew past overnhead, heading for the union lines. It exploded and took out a cannon,nthe gunners lying in various grotesque positions. Ten yards to go. Eight yards. Five yards, Jonathannshifted his grip on his rifle. They were in range,nonce again the union fence and lines dissolved into smoke and fire, anwall of lead soared at Jonathan. Men toppled, twisting, screaming, ornjust falling. Their life-blood soaking the dark Pennsylvania earth,nalien ground, the invaders were dying. \" Fire by Filenleft!\" yelled the lieutenant-colonel. The man all the wayndown at the left end of the line fired, then the man next to him, andnall the way along the line, as the smoke crept closer Jonathan aimednfor a officer standing behind his men, half crouched with his pistolnin hand. The fire crept closer,nthe union troops were loading. The man next tonJonathan fired. Jonathan fired. ThenMinnie ball went wide, Jonathan could see it strike the ground, thennthe smoke over took him, he began to reload, his eyes stinging. As Jonathan drew hisnrammer the Yankees fired again, more men tumbled, striking the groundnwith cries of pain. Jonathan was again, untouched. The smoke driftednup as Jonathan finished reloading. \" Fire by Rank!\" ordered the lieutenant-colonel \"Rear rank aim!\" \"Rear rank FIRE!\" The men behindnJonathan fired, and before the smoke briefly blocked his visionnJonathan saw several Yankees fall. \"Rear rank load!\" the lieutenant-colonel The men of the rearnrank begin the process of loading as the lieutenant-colonel ordered: \"Front rank aim!\" Jonathan aimednfor the same officer. The rest of the rank chose their targets. \"Front ranknFIRE!\" commanded the lieutenant-colonel Jonathan pulled thentrigger. This time the Minnie ball struck the man to the officer'snright. He fell, clutching his arm, his carbine falling from hisnhands. \" Fix Bayonets!\" Ordered the lieutenant-colonel. Jonathan grabbed hisnbayonet, he had taken it off his rifle and cleaned of the gore sincenthe last assault. When the men had finished attaching their bayonetsnthe lieutenant-colonel ordered the charge: \"CHARGEnBAYONETS!\" Jonathan set his riflenat a forty-five degree angle. \"CHARGE!\" Jonathan and the restnof the regiment ran forward, screaming the inhuman sound of the rebelnyell. Seventy yards to thenfence. The Union cannon firedncanister rounds into the charging mass of men. Dozens fell, or camenapart in showers of gore. Fifty-five yards tongo. The Yankee cavalrynfired a volley of musketry into the regiment. More men fell, landingnin heaps, some maybe another five yard further than where they werenhit. Forty yards to go. Twenty-five yards tongo. Ten yards. Jonathan reached thenfence, bayonet leveled. A private jumped up ahead of him, swingingnhis carbine, he missed by a mile. Jonathan hit him over the top ofnthe head with the butt of his rifle. The Yankee collapsed, clutchingnhis broken skull. Ansecond private ran at Jonathan, this one had a bayonet on hisncarbine. Jonathan knocked aside the carbine, then whacked the boynunder the chin, he fell backward, landed hard groaning. Suddenlyna sharp pain blossomed in Jonathan's side. He fell away from thenblow, his head slammed into something hard. A man slammed downnclose-by his arm smacking Jonathan's face. Jonathannfelt blood coming out of his nose. Another heavy weight hit Jonathannin the face. He blacked out.[Chapter 3] Gettysburg: July 1stn1863 8:30 P.M Dusk was falling overnthe field, several men were wandering amongst the prone figures,nsometimes stopping and bending over figures, shaking them then movingnon. Every now and then one of the shaken men would stagger to theirnfeet and limp off into the gathering dark. One of the searchersnstepped over a body, one that had collapsed the section of fencenwhere it landed. A prone figure stirred, the man was trapped under anbody, with an arm across his face. The searcher bentndown. \"Hey, you aliventhere?\" he asked, laying his hand on the man shoulder. The man groaned. \"I'm alive.\" hensaid weakly. \"We'll get you tonthe hospital, you'll be okay.\" The man groaned again. The searcher stood andncalled: \"I found one!\" Several of the othernsearchers picked their way across the field, two had a stretcher. The first searchernrolled the dead body off of the wounded man. \"What's your namensoldier?\" asked the searcher. \"Jonathan, JonathannNiles…\" he said weakly then moaned. The other searchersnbrought the stretcher over the fence, one was holding a lamp, and henlit it. Jonathan stirred and raised his hand to cover his eyes. Hisnnose was smashed, dried blood covered his face. The cloth around hisnleg was bloody, his side felt like hell, but there was no blood. The gray-cladnsearchers gently lifted Jonathan onto the stretcher and began toncarry him off the field. Jonathan lost consciousness again. *** Near Gettysburg: Julyn1st 1863 10:30 P.M Jonathannwoke again, laying outside a tent, it was very dark now. His leg andnside were killing him. He was very thirsty, he had been lying in thensun all the damn day. Jonathan turned his head, looked around. He wasnsurrounded by men lying on stretchers. One large tent had a light innit. He tried to look closer but the flap was closed. The canvas wasnsplattered with some dark liquid. Jonathan passed outnagain. *** Near Gettysburg: Julyn2nd 1863 7:30 A.M A man knelt overnJonathan, holding a mug and a plate. Jonathan stirred. \"You hungrynprivate?\" asked the man. Jonathan groaned,n\"yes…\" The man set down thenplate and pressed the mug into Jonathan's hand, patted him on thenshoulder and left. Jonathan drank thenwater in one gulp, he had not drunk anything for twenty-four hours.nNot since the first assault yesterday. He downed the food in only anfew minutes, some hardtack and a small piece of bacon. An hour later annorderly came over, changed the bandage on Jonathan's leg and left.nJonathan lay still for a while, tried to sleep, but the damn sun keptnhim from sleeping, that and the pain from his wounds. The day wore on.nWounded men all around him, some died and began to smell in the hotnsun. The pain in Jonathan's leg worsened as the day dragged on. Bynnoon all he could do was keep from screaming. At around two in thenafternoon he couldn't even do that. By three o'clock henwas totally exhausted. He drifted in and out of consciousness for anwhile. Close to four o'clocknhe fell into a fitful sleep. After another hour he saw the firstnwounded from today's fighting drift into the hospital. By evening,nwhen the orderly came back with more food and water there werenhundreds of men all around Jonathan. Most were moaning or screamingnsporadically. By six o'clocknJonathan was asleep. Around eight o'clock he woke for a while,nscreaming, before he exhaustedly fell unconscious. *** Gettysburg: July 3rdn1863 6:00 A.M Earlynin the morning Jonathan awoke again. He was surrounded by thousandsnof wounded men. The surgeons were performing amputations in front ofneveryone. A huge heap of limbs poked out from behind one of thentents. Later in the morning andifferent orderly gave Jonathan some water. His leg felt like it wasnon fire. The bandage was bloody again. The orderly changed it. Jonathan screamed forna while then passed out for several hours. When he woke up again thensmell was horrifying. He heard artillery in the distance. He did notncare. His leg was almost beyond feeling. Jonathan fell into anblurry haze of fitful sleep, screaming and pain. Hours passed and thenpain grew even worse. Jonathan was beyond exhausted, he could notnmove at all. He did not remember anything past the last five minutes,nand even before that his memory was hazy. Eventually someonenloaded him into a wagon. After about an hour or two the wagon startednrolling. Every bump was agony. Every time the wagon turned men rollednonto Jonathan's leg. Every bump Jonathannscreamed. He heard others say something, he could no longernunderstand speech, and he was delirious by the second hour in thenwagon. Eventually he fell asleep. The next day the wagon rolled on.nJonathan stopped screaming, he could no longer make noise. Several days passed,nevery few hours someone came to the back of the wagon and gave thenwounded water. Eventually Jonathan was unloaded. He was fed and givennwater. Someone put him in a bed. The next morningnJonathan Niles was dead.

Why the hell did those asses have toncome here could it have been Freddie's school? WHY ME? Right then I got a call and answerednit without checking the caller I.D. \"Hello.\" I said. I must admit Indidn't sound a little bitchy but what do you expect it's liken2:30 and i just wasted time on guys that weren't Freddie \"Hey there trouble, see I caughtnyou at a bad time.\" Freddie's voice boomed out of the phone. \"Yeah well I lost an hour of sleepnand guess what a bunch of stupid guys are coming to stay here now.\"nI grumbled \"Wait what are you doing up?\" Inasked as I walked out of the building the others had left oncenFreddie called, they figured that I would use my curfew time talkingnto him. \"Oh um.... I'm just studying forna test I have tomorrow.\" He said oddly sounding louder \"Oh cool... I guess.\" I said notnthinking much about it. It was quite dark out and I thoughtnto go inside. You never know what these Bright-nerds may do to angirl. All of a sudden I was launched tonthe ground. (A/N: I thought about ending itnhere LOL I'm not gonna be that mean.....yet) The dark shadow hovering over me sawnthat my mouth was open ready to let out a yelp and quickly covered itnwith his hand. \"Shhhhhhhhhhh\" The figurenmuffled. \"What the hell are you doing?\" Inasked in an outraged tone \"Surprise Well I guess this wasn'tnthe best way to do it but I'd choose this over you yelling andngetting me kicked out of my own mother's school.\" Said the voice That voice It was Freddie. Her Freddie \"Freddie\" I said before Inlaunched myself hugging him, I jumped up and he caught my legs sonthat he was picking me up. \"I missed you Trouble.\" He saidnin his adorable accent \"I missed you too.\" I said, andnit was true, I have never missed anybody like I missed him. Wellnthere was my Dad and Molly but they were my family. Freddie, he wasnthe only guy that I could ever imagine running off on a white shiningnhorse towards a sunset with. Very Disney for even me I know butnwhen you find your Freddie I'll just laugh at you. HAH \"What are you doing here?\" Inasked I knew he was from Brighton but was scared to assume it. Younnever know he could be staying for the night and leaving for the nextnday. We had never really talked about his school. You see he had leftnjust only a few days after the big ol' bitch Harriet left and wendidn't want to talk about anything other than us. \"Silly Girl, I go...went tonBrighton. You see I now go to Abbey you see this gorgeous Americanngirlfriend of mine goes there. You may have seen her. She can attractna little bit of danger with her ...but I like a little risk.\" Hensaid winking \"You'd think I know her.\" Insaid playing along \"Oh you know her perfectly well.\"nHe said before attaching his mouth to mine only breaking apart fornair once a few minutes later only to kiss me again. I could never getnused to the butterflies running around my stomach when he kissed me.nThey were there when he grabbed my hand or kissed my forehead butnthey came in bigger doses when he kissed me. \"I'm really going to like havingnyou around\" I said pulling him down to the grass to sit down withnme. ........................................................................................................................................................................ Me and Freddie just sat therentalking for around an hour and a half. One thing I loved with him wasnthat I could just totally be myself. Drama queen or normal chick henstayed with me for me and you can't understand how good that madenme feel. \"We better start heading in minlady.\" He said while getting up and extending an arm for me. \"Well thank you Mr. Kingsley.\" Insaid laughing my ass off. He walked me to my dorm which wasnconveniently right beside his. He gave me a quick kiss and said hisngoodbyes. I snuck into my dorm room withoutnwaking up any of the girls and took a quick glance at the clock. 5 a.m FUCK I only have like 6 hours to sleep. But it was worth it because I wasnwith for the first time in 2 months. And now I'm gonna be with himnevery day now. Could my life get any better? ........................................................................................................................................................................ 1101 words there for you excludingnthe author's note here and at the beginning of the chapter. Sorry Inhaven't updated but honestly I'm living on like 6 hours of sleepnWHICH IS HORRIBLE for me.

Poppy's P.O.V: I woke up with a huge smile on mynface. HA Drippy thought I had cheated on my Low Fat diet but guessnwhat.... I QUIT IT. It was just something to distract me from missingnFreddie but he's here NOW!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Lol it's like I'm Freddie high.nThat or something else. Eh lets just go with the Freddienhigh thing I'm too lazy to think right now. I am Freddie high afternall. Wanna hear something funny. Thengirls practically molested me for answers! Talk about being attackednby a wagon wheel! God it's been like 12 hours (wellnkinda 5 minutes cuz i slept 11 hours and 55 minutes of it) and Inalready miss him. Why don't I just call him? I picked up my new Iphone andnquickly Scrolled through my contacts. As I was passing my Incompletely missed the F section and when straight to the R. Ruby EWW what the hell is that bitch'snnumber doing in my phone. Oh yeah I forgot to delete it. I deleted it without even thinkingnabout it. Hasta La VistanPhysco Cow! Yeah so I scrolled up and callednFreddie. \"Whoever the hell this is you wokenme up so get the hell out!\" said a sleepy boyfriend of mine. \"Uh yeah last time I checked Mr.nKingsley you woke me up like 20 time when you were here last AND I'mnnot in your room smartass\" I smirked He was pretty cute when he was justnwoken up, that I had to admit! \"Trouble? Ah man Trouble, Inwasn't expecting you to wake up this early. I thought I had atnleast another 2 hours.\" He teased \"Maybe I sacrificed a few hours ofnsleep so that I could hang out with my boyfriend. After all mynmorning classes are all cancelled.\" I said \"Yeah that sounds good, let's gonfor a walk and after our classes we can hang out for a bit.\" Hensuggested \"Yeah sure we can do that. Let'sngo soon though it's pretty nice in the morning and it should benpretty deserted outside. We can have some Poppy&Freddie; time\" We set a time for him to pick me up.n11:30. It would be pretty nice because on a day like this most kidsnwouldn't leave their dorm till atleast 3. I bet at least half ofnthem hooked up with a Brighton guy already. ........................................................................................................................................................................ I took a nice hot shower. The warmnwater felt awesome on my back I had lacrosse practice yesterdaynmorning and was stiff. I got out put on my silk robe and strolled bynmy little walk in closet. It was pretty big despite me being in andorm. I wasn't complaining anyways. I got a pair of black skinny jeansnand a red and blue tank top which had the words 'ALL AMERICAN GIRL\"nwritten in white block letters. I also put on a white cuff braceletnand my favourite non heel boots which were black leather. After a fewnwalks with Freddie I realised that when your heel gets stuck in grassnit ain't pretty at all. As a last touch I sprayed a bit ofnVery Irresistible by Givenchy. Freddie loved the smell of it and mynlavender shampoo. 11:15 Great I had 15 minutes to spare. I quickly checked my email and sawnthat I had 2 new emails. One from my dad and one from my littlensister Molly. I read them and sent them a quick reply that would holdnthem on until at least tomorrow. Just as I clicked send on my lastnletter there was a knock on my door. Perfect timing as always Inthought to myself. I opened the door and wasnpractically mauled to the ground. Eh either way I kissed him backnwith the exact same force and need. He guided me to my little sofanwhile and kept kissing me, only breaking for air if needed. He oh sonslowly laid me down on the sofa and got on top of me. He did thisnthing where he didn't put all his weight on top of me so that I wasncrushed but he put some on which drew me crazy because it felt as ifnI was even closer to him. I was too preoccupied by Freddie but aroundn10 minutes later I'm guessing he stopped and kissed my cheek. \"What brought all that on?\" Inasked breathlessly \"I'm still trying to wrap thenthought of me seeing you every day now around my head. For all I knownthis could be a dream.\" He said while staring at me. I laughed \"Well. It's not and Inbelieve we were supposed to go for a walk now. So do me a favour andnget off of me so we can actually go on it.\" He grinned, chuckled and got off ofnme while extending a hand to help me up. ........................................................................................................................................................................ Me and Freddie had gone on manynwalks when he was here last. He had even shown me his secret spotnwhich had now turned into our secret spot. If you walked just passednthe courtyard there was just a pavement area. If you just spentnanother 2 minutes you would reach a little grassy area with a benchnand garden as well as large full grown trees. It was awesome because the gardennwas beautiful, the tall trees provided shade and the bench was prettyndarn comfy. As soon as we got there wenpractically picked up where we left off in my dorm. I didn't mindnthough. It just felt so surreal you know. Like I can't seem tonreally believe it. We also had spent a couple months apart and Inguess we just missed being together a lot. It was just a phase. I cannassure you in around a months time we won't be hopping eachother. We walked around for a bit until hensaid something so sweet. \"I really missed you, you know?nYou were the first thing I thought of when I woke up and the lastnthing I thought of when I went to sleep. When I watched all thosenAmerican sitcoms I laughed while thinking of you. When I went out tonshop and see those odd, bizarre drama queens, I just thought of younmy queen. I'm falling Poppy Moore and I just can't stop. Thenreally funny thing is, I don't think I want to stop.\" He saidnwhile staring intently into my eyes. For a moment I was lost the sea ofnhis eyes. I looked at my feet and gathered upnmy thoughts before I spoke. \"I can honestly say you've beennon my mind since I woke up today. I remember all those great time Inhad with you and the great times I had when I was just thinking ofnyou. The times that I would dance in my dorm to our song. Or thentimes I would just stare at pictures of us. There was also the time Instole your t- shirt, just to sleep in. Yeah that was me by the way.nEven a little thing like that would make me feel so close to you. Younsay you're falling but... I think I may have already fallen.\" Insaid while bracing myself to look at him. When I looked, he seemed to benanalysing something but within 5 seconds his face broken out into anbig wide grin that showed not only in his smile but in his gorgeousneyes. I expected him to say somethingndeep, but he did just the opposite. A playful glint danced around innhis eyes before he gave me a quick kissed that only lasted a minute.nHe pulled back chuckled and said. \"Tag, your it.\" He took off running. ........................................................................................................................................................................ Alrightynso what's gonna happen at dinner? I can feel the romance LOL Well I thought I would have a bitnof fluff then breakout into the drama!

Yeah so withoutnfurther delay here is chappie 4! .................................................................................................................................................. Poppy's P.O.V: Yeah so it's around 7np.m and I'm just getting ready for the dinner me and Freddie arengoing to have. He told me to dress casual and warm especially causenof the \"cold\" they think it's cold here when it's like only 4ndegrees Celsius. I mean sure California is warm but when I went tonAspen every year for like every year of my life I lived in -15 degreenweather! Yeah I'm ramblingnwhat cha gonna go SUE ME! So you may be wondering how mine andnFreddie's morning went (well even if you aren't I'm gonna tellnyou!) ****THAT MORNING****n(starting from the end of the last chapter!) Me and Freddie hadnbeen playing tag for about an hour and honestly we had been havingnthe most fun ever. Yeah me socialite Poppy Moore was playing antoddler's game but I was rocking it! Freddie had been trying toncatch me for about 15 minutes and having no success at all.nCurrently, I was hiding by a fountain. It was quiet, toonquiet, for the past 8 minutes given take; Freddie was calling my namenbecause he couldn't see me it was quite entertaining to hear himncall out \"BABE COMMON WHERE ARE YA I FEEL LIKE A DORK SCREAMING URnNAME OUT\". All of a sudden Infelt a pair of arms grab me from my waist and throw me across theirnback. I would have yelled but no stranger would have zapped me withnan electric current that shot straight up my palm and given mentingles. Only Freddie could do that. So I startednlaughing and telling him to put me down but he just laughed and saidnno. \" Well I caught younhadn't I now I'm just claiming you, my prize which is rightfullynmine.\" He had said. So he carried mynaround until we got to his dorm even then he carried me until he satnme upside down on his sofa. \" Want a coke?\"nhe asked \" Yes please.\" Inresponded Once he tossed thencoke to me, he sat on the other side of the sofa (kind of get what Inmean? It's like a 3 seater and they both take up one seat and leaventhe middle empty) we sat there just staring at each other for aroundn30 minutes until he came to the middle of the sofa and pulled me ontonhis lap and hummed in my ear. I think it was \"You think I don'tncare\" by Jack McManus (A/N: LOLnTHAT'S THE SONG THAT PLAYS DURING THEIR DATE!) it was pretty soothing and made me even more calm than I actuallynwas. After he hummed likenthree quarters of the song, he turned me around so that I was on hisnlap facing him and my feet were on either side of him against thenarms of the sofa. Without giving me warning, he bent his head downnand kissed me soundlessly and as we broke apart, he muttered thingsnlike \"you're so beautiful\" and \"god I love kissing you\", tonme I could never get tired of hearing him say things like that. Itnwas like hearing an angel sing. After spending mostnof the remainder of our time on the sofa making out we realized itnwas time we got to our afternoon classes. As I was going to get up tonleave he quickly pulled me down and kissed me again but the effort innthis one made me feel that he was trying to get his way with me. \" Please\" kissn\"Stay\" kiss kiss \"with\" kiss \"Me\" I could hardly saynno to that but after like 2 minutes I got off him and said... \" Common dork, youncan't be late it is your mom's school after all. Now get off thatncute lazy butt now.\" He wordlessly got upnand crossed the room to me and kissed me again. When he pulled backnhe was grinning and I kissed the smile on his face. Together wencrossed the campus hand in hand with the same broad smile plasterednon our faces. We may have looked like idiots to some with those bigngoofy smiles but we were just too happy. \" So I'll meet upnwith you at 7:45 tonight for that dinner alright?\" he asked beforendropping me off at the main hall. I agreed gave him anpeck on the cheek and went inside. ****END FLASHnBACK**** So here I am justngetting ready for my little dinner sort of date with Freddie. I got my clothes readyn(a pair of black skinny jeans, a grey tank top and to be prepared fornthe \"cold\" I wore a dark purple cardigan) and set them on my bed. The girls werencurrently at the Library learning about the American Revolution so Inhad the dorm to myself. Amazingly I completely remembered all thatnhistory junk Uncle Bobby told me during his visits and that helped menget prepared for the exam I was going to have in 2 days. I ran to the laundrynroom which was at the end of the hallway outside me dorm and got myntowel which was already in the dryer and sprinted to the shower in myndorm. It was around 7:20 whennI got out and I spent time straightening my hair and putting a littlenbit of make up on. Freddie preferred me without any at all but Indunno when I was in Cali I pounded that stuff on I guess old habitsndies hard. Right now though I was only wearing some foundation, anlittle eyeshadow, some mascara and a thin layer of a clear lip gloss.nIt was an improvement I guess I sure did feel pretty especially whennI was with Freddie. When I heard a knock onnthe door, I secured my bath robe so that it wouldn't fall. God thatnwould be embarrassing! When I opened the door,nguess who I saw surprise surprise, it was Freddie. When he saw menstill in my robe he raised his eyebrows in amusement. \"You're early younknow.\" I reminded him in a sing song-ish British accent. \"Yeah babe but Incouldn't stay away from ya toots.\" He replied in the worstnAmerican accent I had ever heard. I laughed and quicklyngot changed in my bathroom. When I got out my handnwas grabbed my Freddie's and my fingers were interlaced with his. \"Where are we going?\"nI asked \"It's a surprisenTrouble.\" He said with glee in his eyes. .......................................................................................................................................................... 1,105 words exactlynthere Sorry for the crappynchapter guys it's just that I haven't been in the mood and ifnyou're not in the mood then you just writing pieces are justnhorrible.

Ok sonthe drama should be starting soon but there's a little in thisnchappie. Ok sonI've bothered you enough here's the next chapter: WCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWC Poppy'snP.O.V. \"PLEASEnPLEASE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE WE'RE GOING!\" I begged for whatnseemed to be the billionth time. \"Sorrynbut no can do babe\" Freddie said with a smile among his face. \"Alright\"nI huffed Tennminutes later I couldn't stand the wait. \"Freddienjust tell me\" I basically yelled All hendid was chuckle and say \"Patience is virtue.\" So whennwe stopped at a red light I realized that nothing I could say would change his mind. I leanednover to his seat while he was looking out the window and quickly tooknhis face in my hands. His face wore a mask of confusion but before hencould say anything I tilted his face towards me and crashed my lipsnon him. I was so glad that the road was completely empty so nobodynwould be honking at us, yelling and giving us the finger. I wasnpulled out of my thoughts by his tounge licking my bottom lip askingnfor an entrance. I automatically opened my mouth and immediatelynmoaned into his mouth. Before I could get carried away I rememberednwhy I was kissing him away. I quickly pulled away leaving half anninch space between our lips. \"Younwanna tell me where we're going now?\" I asked with a small smile. Henalmost gave in. Almost \"Nonway trouble, when hell freezes over\" Inlaughed and finally decided to give in. Nothing I could say or do would change his mind. So afternanother half hour of driving in Freddie's car we ended up at anpopular old fashioned hamburger joint that was a big place for teens,nI quite liked it, but maybe that was just because I was on a datenwith Freddie oh well. \"Whatnare you doing?\" I asked as he was staring at me. \"Justnlooking at the cute, gorgeous girl in front of me. Oh and did Inmention that she's all mine?\" He said with a little smirk \"Hanha, we've been dating what a month and a half and you're alreadyngoing territorial on me?\" I joked \"Yep,nbetter get used to it babe.\" Did Inmention the butterflies I just felt when he said babe. Incovered it up by making a joke about me being nobody's. He knewnthat I belonged to him and him to me. Usually I would have cowerednaway and ran a mile but something just felt so right with him. When Insaw him get up I quickly got worried that he didn't realize that Inwas joking. \"Wherenare you going?\" I asked, my voice slightly shaking. \"Nonwhere trouble, I'll be back\" He gave me a reassuring smile andnquickly squeezed my hand. My eyesnfollowed him till I saw him approach a old retro jukebox, when Inheard the guitar starting I laughed. He always hummed I'm yours bynJason Miraz when I was sleepy. It was my own lullaby. He camenback and led me to a little open area. We swayed slowly to the musicnfor a little bit. I felt so good when he lifted my feet onto his andnput all the effort into dancing (like in twilight during the prom).nIt reminded me of the numerous times when I was around 5 or 6 and myndad would dance with me at weddings or parties. After anlittle bit of dancing we went back to our table and ordered dessert.nI ordered a white chocolate brownie that turned out to be the size ofnmy head (there goes my diet) and he ordered a massive banana split.nYou wouldn't think it but it was the funniest thing to eat dessertnwith Freddie. When he would be 'subtle' and try to take a bitenof my brownie or get an ice cream moustache. I named him Mr.nMoustacho When henwent to pay the bill (after much arguing) a tall guy around mine andnFreddie's age came towards me. He had light brown hair with anbeanie covering most of it and green eyes. He had a slight tan and annice white smile. He was around Freddie's height and wore a greynand red retro printed t-shirt with black skinny jeans. To finish offnhe wore red and black checkered vans. He was cute no doubting it butnthere was nothing that could compare to Freddie in her opinion. Hencame to her table with a huge smile. He had a smile which gave off anreal friendly vibe. \"HeynI'm Ryan\" he said with an American accent \"HeynI'm Poppy\" I said with a smile \"You'renAmerican\" He exclaimed \"YeahnI'm from L.A nice to actually hear an American accent. I don'tnfeel as much of an alien right now\" I said with a laugh \"Nonway I'm from San Clemente.\" \"I seenyou're from the O.C\" I joked \"I canntell you are from the Hollywood Hills too\" He laughed \"Donyou miss Cali?\" He suddenly asked with a slight frown. \"YeahnI do, I miss the weather and my family but I have so many people herenwho make it all the better.\" I finished with a smile. \"Heyndo you mind giving me your number? I'm new here and I really don'tnhave any friends and it would totally be awesome to have a friend whonactually understands where I came from.\" \"Yeahnsure\" I said while grabbing his I phone. I remember just before Inbecame friends with Kate and the girls how lonely I felt and if I hadna friend I would have been way happier. \"Youncan call me any time.\" I said (A/N: she said it as a friend guys) Just asnthose words flew out of my mouth I saw Freddie glaring at us as henapproached. \"Andnwhy is it that my girlfriend can call you anytime?\" Freddie questioned Ryan WCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWCWC Alrightnso there's a little drama. I wanted a little bit of fluff in thenbeginning so you could kinda see that side of them. Wellnthanks for sticking to me uf04a you all once again deserve a cookie Xoxo Rachel[Chapter 8] Heyy So yeah it kinda was a little mean of me to leave you guys with a cliffy like that... but there's more to come! YES RYAN SHALL RETURN OFTEN! Is it kinda bad for me to like Ryan....well I kind of am moulding him into whatever I want him to be....ehh OH and I wanna change the name of the story. What happens Next is very boring :P so if you got any ideas I know I usually do special thanks and all that but like........I'm kinda too tired to write ALLLLLL THESE REVIEWS.......THAAAAAAAANK YOU THOUGH SOOOOOOOOO I didn't think I was gonna write another chappie for a while. I didn't know what to do. I read the story over and kinda got inspired. SO HERE WE GOOOOOOOO! Poppy's POV: What the hell is going on? My Freddie spazzing out like that? Can I repeat: WHAT THE HELL \"Freddie this is Ryan, Ryan this is Freddie\" \"Nice to meet you man\" said Ryan \"Don't pretend like you don't know me\" said Freddie with his teeth clenched \"Man, come on....this can be a new start for us\" pleaded Ryan What The Fuck Is Going ON? I decided to to take matters into my own hands \"Uh..Freddie lets go you said we could do something after right?\" His stone hard eyes looked at me. \"What?\" He said, slowly calming down. \"Let's go and get some ice cream or something.\" I said while pleading with my eyes for him not to make a scene. \"Alright then.\" He quickly grumbled He quickly turned back and in a dark voice said... \"If I see you with her again I'll do much more than give you a black eye.\" Freddie's P.O.V: As we hopped into my car I could feel the anger radiating out of me. I looked at Poppy looking at me frightened. I felt myself feeling something else now. Horror. MY Poppy afraid of me. \"Hey there, come here\" I whispered She slowly climbed onto my lap with her back resting against the steering wheel. \"What happened...you really scared me. I mean that look on your face. Fuck, it just scared me\" She mumbled \"I'm sorry trouble, I just...I know Ryan. He uses girls. They're like a game to him. Especially taken ones.\" I said \"I'd never cheat!\" \"I know, but......he's done this to me before trouble. I'm .... I'm just scared\" \"It's alright.\" She said before kissing me Poppy'P.O.V: So here we are, an hour later at a park bench eating ice cream. Well I'm eating ice cream. Freddie dropped his and is trying to take a bite of mine. \"Come on Troubleeeeeeeeeee\" He whined \"No smartass. You dropped yours while attempting to throw your ice cream cone in the air and catch it! Why the hell would you even want to do that?\" I laughed \"I wanted to impress my girlfriend. You know my sweet, loving, BEAUTIFUL,AMERICAN girlfriend\" he said with that cheeky grin I'd come to love so much \"Aww you're so cute\" I started He smiled hopefully It was a cute smile. Don't Get me Wrong. But I like my Ice cream. I've been on a Low Fat Diet for a month! I NEED THIS ICE CREAM \"But.......you're not gonna get MY ice cream\" I said triumphantly He smiled another smile. But it wasn't that same smile. OH NO. It was the smile You know that mischievous smile he had. The one where you knew he had a plan. While I was in my daze he got up from the bench, TOOK my ice cream and ran. OH HELL NO I bolted after him and guess what? I caught him. I tackled him too. NOT SMART My ice cream ended up on the floor. Along with us. Regular P.O.V: Poppy and Freddie ended up at Freddie's dorm. His roommate had been with his girlfriend for the night so they'd have their privacy. \"You know we had a pretty great day.\" Sighed Poppy happily \"Other than dinner, Trouble I'm really sor..............\" Freddie started \"It's fine. Really I understand. We had a great day overall. You're here at Abbey, I'm here....it's all good!\" Poppy said, cutting him off. \"You really are something Trouble.\" Teased Freddie \"Is that a good thing?\" wondered Poppy aloud \"Yes...yes it is.\" Chuckled Freddie Poppy yawned. \"Come on let's go to sleep Trouble.\" Said Freddie who was fighting off his own yawn \"Yeah lets\" managed Poppy That night they slept peacefully in each other's arms. Dreaming of each other. They we finally together and happy. No drama, no Harriet, nothing.

I rolled my eyes and turned the volume to medium. I couldn't help that my favorite band was Van Halen and I liked rock n roll. Maybe I should tell you about myself. My name is Arsenal, like the famous rock band. I think that's what my parents named me after. I only have my mom. My mom and dad had gotten into a fight when I was a baby (which was sometime in the 70s), and my dad left my mom. I have no idea who he is, since my mom doesn't talk about him a lot. My mom looks like me in only two ways. We have the same voice and personality. She said I was an exact replica of my father. So anyways, I was sitting up in my room, listening to loud music, and flicking through a magazine. I heard a knock on my bedroom door. \"Yeah!\" I yelled over my music. The door opened and my mom stood there. She sat down on the bed and stroked my hair. \" Hey honey. Are you still looking for a job?\" my mom asked. I looked at her carefully. \" Yeah, but you know I want to go into the music industry,\" I sighed. She smiled. \" Well, they have a job opening for a band, they need someone who can play the keyboard.\" She said. \" I recommended you.\" \"Which band?\" I asked. \" AC/DC? Van Halen? Poison? Arsenal? Tell me!\" \" It's Arsenal,\" my mom smiled. I gave out a little shriek. Stacee Jaxx was in that band, and he was my idol. Even though he drank a lot and had sex a lot, he still had lots of good songs. I had always dreamed of working with him. \" Where do I go to file for a job?\" I asked. \" The Bourbon Room.\" I loved that place. It was one of my favorite places to be, since my mom and I lived in Hollywood. My friends Drew and Sherrie worked there. They had even met Stacee Jaxx! I never got to see him at the Bourbon Room, though, because I was at a AC/DC concert (I had bought a ticket and reserved it for a year). I got up and turned off my record player. \" I'm going to the Bourbon Room!\" I said, running out of my room. \" Good luck!\" my mom said as I ran out the front door. I walked down the street and began to sing one of my favorite songs. I come home in the morning light, my mother says \"when you gonna live your life right?\" oh, mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones and girls, they wanna have fun oh girls, just wanna have fun I was halfway to the Bourbon. The phone rings in the middle of the night, my father yells \"What you gonna do with your life?\" Oh, daddy dear, you know you're still number one but girls, they wanna have fun, that's what they really want, some fun, when the working day is done oh girls they wanna have fun Some of the teenage girls around my age joined me. girls they want, wanna have fun, girls wanna have... I saw the Bourbon in my vision. I jumped up onto a light pole and looked at the bright blue sky. Some boys take a beautiful girl and hide her away from the rest of the world I wanna be the one to walk in the sun Oh, girls Just wanna have, that's all they really want Some fun.. When the working day is done Oh, girls, They wanna have fun, Oh girls, Just wanna have fun... I jumped down and ran down the street, getting closer to the Bourbon with each step. Girls, they want, wanna have fun, girls, wanna have. They just wanna, they just wanna.. They just wanna, Oh, They just wanna, girls just wanna have fun, oh Girls just wanna have fun, they just wanna, they just wanna, they just wanna, they just wanna, oh They just wanna, girls just wanna have fun, girls just wanna have fun When the working day is done, Oh, when the working day is done, oh girls, girls, just wanna have fun I was at the doors, ready to enter. I saw a man in the window, staring down at me curiously. They just wanna, they just wanna, they just wanna, They just wanna have fun Girls just wanna have fun, they just wanna, they just wanna, they just wanna, they just wanna, have fun They just wanna, girls just wanna have fun, they just wanna, oh girls, wanna have fun, girls just wanna have fun When the workin, when the workin day is done, oh, when the working day is done, oh, girls, girls just wanna have fun They just wanna, they just wanna, oh girls, They just wanna, have fun, Oh girls...girls just wanna have fun That song could be a description of me. I just wanna have fun and live my life while I still have it. I entered through the front door and made my way over to the bar. It wasn't too jammed packed today. Lonny and Dennis were behind the bar. \" LONNY!\" I yelled. He turned. \" Hey Arsenal,\" he replied. \" Mom told me that Arsenal were having job openings and the forms were here!\" I said. \" You're lucky I saved this form for you,\" Dennis said, handing me a piece of paper and pen. \" Thanks Dennis!\" I sat down on a bar stool and began writing down my information. Name: Arsenal Jackson Age: 17 Birth date: May 9th Eye Color: Blue- green Hair Color: Dark Brown Any criminal records: None Job: Keyboarder Gender: female Height: 5'5 Weight: 110 lbs. Talent(s): Song-writing, singing, dancing Disorder(s): Anxiety, Depression, Bulimia Parents: Madison Jackson, father unknown Even though I didn't get some of the questions, I still answered them honestly. \" Where do I turn in the form?\" I asked. \" Just hand it back in,\" Lonny said. Lonny looked over the form and frowned. \" It's not getting better, is it?\" he asked. I knew he meant my disorders. \" Not really,\" I replied. \" It will. You can get through it. Promise,\" he said. I smiled slightly. Lonny was always the dad that I'd never got to have. Dennis took the form up to his and Lonny's office. \" You know what's funny,\" Lonny said, trying to change the subject. \" What?\" I asked. \" You look A LOT like Stacee Jaxx.\" \" Why does everyone say that? That's impossible,\" I sighed. \" You don't know that,\" Lonny said. \" How's Drew and Sherrie been?\" \" They've been good. They were waiting for you to fill out a form. They recommended you to Stacee,\" Lonny answered. \" Are they here?\" Lonny opened his mouth to reply, but was interrupted by hearing voices upstairs. \" ARSENAL!\" someone yelled. I turned around and saw Sherrie. \" SHERRIE!\" I yelled back. We hugged each other. \" How have you been? I haven't seen you for months! How's touring been?\" I asked question after question. \" It's been great! They're looking over your form in Dennis's office. I think you might get to tour with Drew and me!\" It felt like fireworks were exploding in my chest. \" Come on!\" Sherrie grabbed my hand and dragged me to Dennis's office. \" What's it like being on tour with Stacee Jaxx?\" I asked as she pulled me along. \" He seems a bit different, after, you know, Constance died during child birth and their baby died afterward...\" Sherrie trailed off. I sighed. I always liked Constance with Stacee. She seemed pretty cool from what Sherrie told me about her. We reached Dennis's office and Sherrie opened the door. \" DREW!\" I said/yelled. Drew turned around and smiled. \" Hey Arsenal!\" Drew replied, giving me a hug. \" Arsenal?\" a cool voice asked from behind Drew. I looked over his should and saw a man. He had a fur coat with a cowboy hat and sunglasses, and slightly tight black leather jeans. He had no shirt. I gasped. It was the one and only Stacee Jaxx! I pulled from Drew and I's hug. \" That's my name,\" I replied. Stacee just kind of stared at me for a moment or two. \" Nice name,\" he finally said. \" Thanks. My parents named me after your band,\" I replied. Sherrie gave an awkward cough. \" Stacee, this is the girl we recommended to you. Arsenal Jackson?\" Sherrie said, signaling to me. \" Oh, right,\" he said. He picked up the form I had filled out just minutes ago. He looked over it long and hard. \" 'father unknown'? \" Stacee asked. I sighed. \" I don't know who he is. My mom never told me.\" He gave a 'hmph' sound and said,\" Interesting.\" A monkey came out from under Dennis's desk. He ran over to me and flung itself onto my leg. \" What the-?\" I began. Stacee Jaxx looked down and saw the monkey on my leg. \" Hey Man,\" he sighed. \" Hey Man what?\" I asked. \" That's the monkey's name,\" Drew explained. I nodded. Hey Man wouldn't get off of my leg. Even when Stacee beckoned him away, he wouldn't do it. He and I ignored the situation. \" Ok, a keyboarder and singer. How do I know you can actually do those things?\" Stacee asked. \" Do you want me to show you?\" I asked. He nodded slightly. I headed down the steps slowly, since Hey Man was still stuck to my leg. I reached the main stage and walked over to the keyboard after pulling up a chair. I looked at the small crowd of people and gulped. I had always had stage fright. The crowd was of Dennis, Lonny, Sherrie, Drew, and Stacee. \" Any requests?\" I asked. \" Don't stop believin'!\" Drew said. I smiled. One of my favorite songs. I cleared my throat and began playing on the keyboard. Just a small town girl, livin in a lonely world. She took the midnight train going anywhere. Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit, he took the midnight train going anywhere... Drew had come up on stage to play the air guitar. A singer in a smoky room, the smell of wine and cheap perfume. For a smile they can share the night it goes on and on and on and on Stacee glanced at me, probably surprised by how well at singing I was. Lonny just smiled. He had NEVER heard my voice before now. Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night Streetlights, people Livin just to find emotion Hidin', somewhere in the night Workin hard to get my fill Everybody wants a thrill Payin anything to roll the dice Just one more time Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues Oh, the movie never ends It goes on and on and on and on Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching in the night Streetlights, people Livin' just to find emotion Hidin somewhere in the night We finally reached my favorite part. Don't stop believin' hold onto that feelin' Streetlights, people Don't stop believin' hold on streetlights, people don't stop believing, hold onto that feeling streetlights, people... I heard clapping, even Hey Man was clapping, who was still stuck to my leg. I gave Drew a high-five and said,\" Thanks for helping me out a bit.\" He just smiled. Stacee came up on stage, smiling. \" You're hired,\" he said, shaking my hand. My eyes went wide. \" You're not joking, right?\" I asked. He laughed. \" No. I heard you from outside too, you know.\" He must've been the man I saw in the window. But, HE WAS SERIOUS! I was a roadie now! And with the band, Arsenal! Hey Man released my leg. \" I guess Hey Man wanted you to join us,\" Sherrie said. I smiled. \" When do we like, leave or when do I start?\" I asked. \" The tour starts tomorrow. We'll be by tomorrow at 12 p.m. ,\" Drew said. I knew he'd show Stacee where to go. Drew used to always come over to my house. He's known me for a while now. My mom used to have him babysit me and he'd come over for dinner sometimes. He's was like the brother I never had. \" I gotta go and tell mom!\" I said hopping up quickly and jumping off the stage. I ran from the Bourbon after saying,\" See you tomorrow!\" I went down the street and went ahead and sang again. I need to express my happiness and love for rock! I saw him standing there my the record machine I knew he must've been about seventeen The beat was going strong Playing my favorite song And I could tell it wouldn't be long before he was with me, yeah me And I could tell it wouldn't be long before he was with me, yeah me I wasn't aware of Hey Man following me. Singing, I love rock n roll so put another dime in the jukebox, baby I love rock n roll so come and take your time and dance with me, OW! I jumped up into the air and kicked my leg out like a true rock fan would. He smiled, so I got up and asked for his name But that don't matter, he said, cause it's all the same He said Can I take you home Where we can be alone? And next we were moving on, he was with me, yeah me Next we were moving on, he was with me, yeah me Singing, I love rock n roll so put another dime in the jukebox, baby I love rock n roll so come and take your time and dance with me, OW! I was home now, so I stopped singing. I noticed Hey Man sitting on the door step. \" Hey Man! You need to go back to The Bourbon Room!\" I said, bending down to his level. I noticed he had a note stuck to him. I got it and read it: Arsenal- Welcome to the crew. -Stacee Jaxx I smiled. \" That's why you followed me, then,\" I said. I found a pen in my shoulder bag that I had been carrying and wrote on the back of it: Thanks. I can't wait to start. -Arsenal I taped the note to Hey Man's leather jacket and he ran off down the street. I stood up and ran into the house. \" MOM!\" I yelled. I heard a pan drop. \" ARSENAL!\" my mom yelled, irritation apparent in her voice. \"WHAT?\" I ran into the kitchen and saw mom holding her foot. \" Oh, sorry. BUT GUESS WHAT?\" I said. She looked at me expectantly. \" I GET TO TOUR WITH ARSENAL AS THEIR KEYBOARDER!\" Her eyes went wide. \" Are you serious?\" she asked. I nodded. She hopped over to me and hugged me. \" That's great, honey! When do you start?\" she asked. \" They'll be stopping by tomorrow at noon!\" Mom paled slightly and sat down. \" Mom, what's wrong?\" I asked. \" Nothing, it's just, I won't be here. I'm, um, going grocery shopping,\" she replied. I raised a brow, but shrugged it off. \" Oh, I wish you could be here! You could meet Stacee Jaxx!\" \"Yeah...\" she mumbled. She looked up and smiled. \" You should get to packing.\" I nodded and ran up to my room. I grabbed my small suitcase. I put all of my best clothes into my suitcase and a few pieces of jewelry. I knew Sherrie would want to take me shopping for clothes while on tour, so I didn't pack my whole closet. I put all of my records (about 10 in all) on top of my clothes and all of my cassette tapes into the top pocket along with my cassette player and headphones. I put on my black bangle bracelets and silver ring. I was already wearing my dagger(knife) necklace and premium red guitar pick necklace. My mom said they belonged to my dad. I placed my keyboard into its case and set on top of the suitcase. I set my stuff by the door and began packing a shoulder bag. I put things like my hair brush, perfume, toothbrush, etc. into it. I began to wonder about my mom. I knew she didn't have to go to the grocery store tomorrow. I just went a few days ago. Why was she lying to me? I plopped down on my bed and stared at my Arsenal poster on the ceiling. I never thought I'd get to be a roadie with them. I couldn't wait until tomorrow. A simple dream had turned real.[Chapter 2] Chapter #2: Calls and Cut I woke up this morning with a start. I peeled open my eyes and sunlight filled my vision. My alarm clock read 10:30 a.m. . I pulled my blankets back and went over to my closet. I pulled on some black tights with a denim skirt over them, and an Iron Maiden shirt over my black tank, with my favorite red converse. I still had on my father's jewelry. I stumbled down to the kitchen to get something to eat. I got a bowl of Wheaties and sat down. My mom had already left, since she had a note on the table for me. She said she would miss me and that she would send me letters all the time. I'd miss her. It seemed way too quiet in the house. Once I finished eating, I went into the living room and got into my mom's old records. I found the Arsenal record she owned and placed it onto the record player. It began playing 'Wanted Dead or Alive'. I jammed out to it as I finished getting my stuff together. The record soon ran out of songs to play in about an hour, so I changed it to Van Halen. I turned the volume up so it was pretty loud. I began dancing around the house a bit, and I forgot that it was nearly noon. I soon heard a knock on the door and then Drew yell,\" ARSENAL! TURN THAT MUSIC DOWN!\" I replied my saying,\" YOU'RE TOO OLD IF IT'S TOO LOUD!\" I turned it down anyways and shut off the record player. I walked down the hall to the front door and opened it. Stacee, Drew, and Sherrie stood there. I stepped aside to let them inside. They came in and Stacee looked at my old childhood pictures. \" Ok, need help getting your stuff?\" Sherrie asked. \" No, but you can come help if you want. I don't care,\" I replied. \" Hey Arsenal, where's Madison?\" Drew asked. Stacee snapped his head up. \" Oh, mom? She went grocery shopping or something. She's been acting really weird lately...\" I said. Stacee began looking at a picture of my mom. Sherrie and I headed up to my room. We entered and she looked at my room. \"Nice room,\" she mumbled. \" Thanks,\" I replied, picking up my bag and slinging it over my shoulder. I put my keyboard on top of my suitcase. I saw someone out of the corner of my eye. I looked up and saw Stacee. He signaled to me, asking if he could come in. I nodded and he came in and sat at my desk. I looked on top of my dresser and saw a picture of my mom. It was torn in half, and looked as if someone was standing by her. She told me my dad was standing by her in that picture. I knew she really didn't want me to know who my dad was, but I did. I had the right to know and she never told me. I grabbed a few pictures from the dresser and put them in my bag. I couldn't leave them behind. I was done and Sherrie asked,\" Why don't you have any pictures of your dad?\" I shrugged. \" My mom has them hidden away somewhere and he left when I was just a baby. I never knew him and I never got experience what it's like to have a dad. It's always been my mom and I.\" Stacee looked guilty for some reason. \" But don't you wonder who he is? Have you ever tried to find him?\" \" I wonder who he is every day. I tried to find him, but I lost hope. It wasn't fun to grow up without a dad. I mean, I got to watch all my friends with their dads and stuff.\" It reminded me of the time I went to the father-daughter dance. I was the only one there without a dad. Sherrie frowned and hugged me. \" Sorry,\" she said. I shrugged. \" At least I had my mom.\" Sherrie let go. \" You ready?\" she said. \" Yup,\" I replied. We headed down the stairs after Stacee. I left a quick note for my mom and we headed out the door. There was a HUGE tour bus outside by my house. I locked up and Drew guided me over to the entrance of the bus. I went up the steps and looked around. There was a living room, kitchen, everything. I had never been on a tour bus, so it was a pretty cool experience. Sherrie grabbed my hand. \" I'll show you to your bunk.\" She led me down a short hall with two doors. \" We get our own room, since we are girls,\" Sherrie said. I nodded. She opened the door and I saw two bunks on the right hand side, a closet on the left, and a small washroom straight forward. Two dressers sat near the bunks. It was cool. \" I finally won't be alone in here all the time!\" Sherrie said. \" You get the bottom bunk.\" I noticed Sherrie had posters hanging up around the room. They were all of our favorite bands. It was 1987, after all. I sat down on the bottom bunk and began hanging up my old photos and a few posters. \" Do you want me to help unpack your clothes?\" \" Sure. I didn't pack a lot.\" \" Smart girl. You knew we'd go shopping together!\" Sherrie smiled. I put my keyboard over by the window, near the record player. Sherrie handed me my records and cassette tapes, player and headphones, and I det them on the shelf beneath the record player. I finally got settled in, and the bus had already left. \" Where are we first preforming at?\" I asked. \" Las Vegas.\" That was 4 hours and 4 minutes from Hollywood. \" Are we preforming there on Saturday?\" I asked. Today was Thursday. \" Yup,\" Sherrie replied. We headed out to the living room after I got my cassette tapes and player. I guess the rest of Arsenal was on a different bus or something, because they weren't on the bus. I sat down by Hey Man and Stacee Jaxx. Sherrie sat on Drew's lap. I was zoned out, listening to Iron Maiden. I couldn't stop thinking about my mom. She was hiding something from me. What was it though? Did it have to do with my dad? God, why did people never tell me what's going on? I guess my face looked screwed up, because Drew said,\" Arsenal's thinking again.\" I looked at him and took off my headphones. \" Hey! Shut up!\" I rolled my eyes. \" It's funny because that's what Stacee does when he's thinking...\" Drew trailed off. I raised an eyebrow. Could THE Stacee Jaxx be my...? No! That's impossible...isn't it? I'd have to talk to either Stacee or my mom. Stacee glanced over at me. I glanced over at him. Was it possible that he was my dad? He would've been 17 when I was born...my mom was 17 when I was born, too... I didn't really know. I just couldn't seem to think that it was possible. There were so many possibilities of who it could be. But, most of the signs were pointing towards Stacee Jaxx. I ignored the situation, though. I pulled out my notebook from my bag. I felt like writing some songs. I had been working on one that I based off of my father. So far, it went: I should have known better Than to let you go alone, It's times like these I can't make it on my own Wasted days, and sleepless nights And I can't wait to see you again... It was all true. I believe that it's my fault my dad left my mom, and that I shouldn't have let him go alone. But, sometimes, I can't make it on my own. I needed a father and I never got one. I spent many days and sleepless nights wondering who my father was. AND, I couldn't wait to see him again. I didn't know when I would see him, but I was determined to. Stacee Jaxx looked over my shoulder at my songs. \" Are those songs?\" Stacee asked. I nodded. \" Oh, she writes lots of songs. I mean, she has notebooks full of them,\" Sherrie said. \" Sherrie!\" I said under my breath, but loud enough for her to hear. \" Oh really? Can I see them?\" Stacee asked. \"Uh-\" I began, but Sherrie hopped up and ran to our room. I threw my notebook on the couch and ran after her. She was already heading out with my notebooks. I gave her a look. She ran past me, not before I grabbed her ankle ( I had slipped on the floor and fell on my way down the hall). She pulled me along. \" Arsenal! Let go!\" she yelled. \" No! Go put those back!\" I replied. We made it to the living room, and Sherrie handed Stacee my notebooks. \" NO! Slowly...dying...good-bye...\" I said, pretending to take in last breaths. I pretended to die and Drew said,\" Why do you always do that? You've been doing that ever since you were like, 11.\" \" Actually, since I was 4. It's fun,\" I answered. I got up and sat back down. Stacee was already looking through my books. I scowled. Stacee looked through all of my books, until finally, he reached the song I was writing. He gave me back my notebooks. \" I like them. Can I use a few of them in the concerts?\" Stacee asked. \" Uh...sure...\" I replied. He wanted to sing some of my songs! ROCKOFAGESROCKOFAGESROCKOFAGESROCKOFAGESROCKOFAGES ROCKOFAGESROCKOFAGESROCKOFAGESROCKOFAGESROCKOFAGES ROCKOFAGESROCKOFAGES It was nighttime, and I was in my room, talking to my mom over the phone. Sherrie was in the bathroom brushing her hair. \" It's been going good so far. Stacee Jaxx is really cool! He read some of my song books and said he wanted to sing them on stage!\" I said through the phone. \" That's great, honey! I'm so proud of you! I know your father either is!\" she replied. Is? \" My father is... ?\" I asked. I heard her gasp. \" Oh, uh, I meant-\" she stuttered. \" Mom, tell me the truth!\" I begged. Sherrie looked at me and mouthed 'what's wrong?'. Drew entered the room. 'Daddy issues' I mouthed back. 'Ohhh' she replied. I heard her sigh. \" Arsenal, I talked to your father today. He called shortly before you did,\" she said. \" ...What?...\" I asked. \" Arsenal, honey, he's so proud of you,\" she replied. \" But he left us! Why would he care about me? He probably wouldn't even like me if we did meet!\" I said. \" Arsenal, don't say that! Your father loves you, he wouldn't have called if he didn't.\" I realized she was right. He wouldn't 'bother' us if he didn't love my mom or me. \" Can I ask a question?\" I asked. \" ok...\" my mom said, worry evident in her voice. \" How did you and dad meet?\" I asked. She sighed. \" We met at the Bourbon. I was set to interview him and the band, since it was their first gig, and I was just at 17. He was amazed by my spit-fire attitude. Soon enough, we fell for each other. But, I had to go back to my office. But, you know what they say. If something loves you, it will come for you. And he did. I traveled with him and his band, and soon enough, you were born to us,\" she replied. I had another question. \" Mom, did you lie about why he leaved?\" I asked. \" I'm sorry, Arsenal, I shouldn't have lied to you...\" she whispered. She sounded on the verge of tears. I was angry, but I knew going off on her was a bad thing to do. She only wanted to protect me from the truth. \" Can I know the truth?\" I asked. \" Your father left because of management.\" she replied. \" They didn't think that you were important in his life, so they made him leave. It was either he stay or he went on with life.\" I felt a tear run down my face. He chose fame over me. And my mom. \" So, he chose fame instead of me?\" I asked, choking back the sobs threatening to escape. Drew gave me a worried glance. \" No, no, no, honey, You have to understand why he did what he did. He left so he could get us a better life.\" \" What does that mean?\" \" It means, he wanted you to grow up the way you're supposed to grow up. Happy. Even though he wasn't there, doesn't mean he still cared. He loves you more than you think. The only thing that mattered to him was your happiness.\" WOW. I man I thought didn't want anything to do with me, cared. He wanted me to live a good life. \" Honey, I've gotta go. I'm going to go see Lonny and Dennis to talk. I love you.\" \" Love you too.\" \"Bye, honey,\" she said. I hung up. \" What's wrong?\" Drew asked. \" It was all a lie.\" I mumbled. I played with the buttons on the phone. \" He wanted to be in my life, but fame took him from me.\" I wiped violently at the tears falling down my cheeks. Sherrie gave me a sad look. \" I need a moment,\" I said, running out of the room. I ran outside into the cool night air. Since the bus was stopped for the night, I stood out on the sidewalk. I began to sing a song I wrote. She stepped off the bus out into the city streets Just a small town girl with her whole life Packed in a suitcase by her feet Those verses reminded me of Sherrie. But somehow the lights didn't shine as bright as they did on her momma's TV screen And the work seemed harder and the days seemed longer than she'd ever thought they'd be... But you know you got to stick to your guns when it all comes down 'cause sometimes you can't choose it's like heads they win, tails, you're gonna lose. I was sitting on the pavement and staring at the stars. I was wondering if my dad was staring at them, too. Win big-Momma's fallen angel Lose big-living out her lies Wants it all-Momma's fallen angel Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life... Now she found herself in the fast lane living day to day Turned her back on her best friends, yeah And let her family slip away... Fresh tears fell. Just like a lost soul caught up in the Hollywood scene All the parties and the limousines Such a good actress hiding all her pain Trading her memories for fortune and fame Just a step away from the edge of a fall caught between heaven and hell Where's the girl I knew a year ago? I heard Drew sing the last part. I looked up and saw him standing by me. Win big-Momma's fallen angel Lose big-living out her lies Wants it all-Momma's fallen angel Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life Too much too soon or just a little too late 'Cause when her ship came in She wasn't there and she just wouldn't wait... Win big-Momma's fallen angel Lose big-living out her lies Wants it all-Momma's fallen angel Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life Win big-Momma's fallen angel Lose big-living out her lies Wants it all-Momma's fallen angel Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life... Drew sat down beside me. We had a settled silence between us for a few minutes, but Drew finally said,\" Can you tell me what's going on?\" I took in a shaky breath and began. \" My dad was famous. He wanted me to grow up around him. Management took him from me. He left so I could have a happy life.\" \" Oh wow...that's not too good,\" Drew replied. \" He met mom through an interview...\" \" Hey, that sounds like Constance...\" Drew said. \" Yeah, but I my dad can't and isn't Stacee Jaxx! AND, my mom didn't die during childbirth and I'm most certainly NOT dead!\" I replied. \" Yeah, but how do you know that? Just think about it, it's not impossible, you know,\" Drew stated. I thought. I thought and thought and thought. It could be possible...No! Arsenal, NO! It's not possible! I snapped out of my thoughts when I heard the tour bus door open. I looked up and saw Stacee. Drew got up and said,\" Just think about it.\" He passed by Stacee and went back inside. Stacee walked over to me and looked down at me. \" You okay?\" he asked. \" Yeah. I'm fine,\" I replied. Total lie. Why did I have to lie about it? \" You sure don't sound like it,\" Stacee replied. I chanced a look up at him. He was staring at me, as if he knew I was lying. \" Do you wanna talk about it?\" I didn't reply. \" Come on.\" He held out his hand. I took it. I stood up. Stacee led us toward a record store that was down the street. He opened the door for me and I stepped inside, him following me afterwards. Luckily, not a lot of people were in the store, so they didn't bother us. I went over to the rock section. I saw Iron Maiden came out with a new record. They already had over 13, and they just wrote them like crazy. \" What's bothering you, Arsenal?\" Stacee asked, flicking through old records. \" It's about my dad...\" I mumbled. Stacee stiffened a bit. I continued on. \" My mom told me a little about him. She told me how the met and why he left in the first place. She said that he's proud of me.\" \" Well, getting to tour with a famous band is a big deal. Why wouldn't anyone be proud?\" \" Yeah...but I just don't think he really, genuinely cares about me. I mean, I'm just me. Nothing special, nothing amazing,\" I replied. \" Don't say that. He probably loves and cares for you more than you think,\" Stacee said, nudging my shoulder. I shrugged. \" I don't know. I just really want to meet him, but I have no idea who he is,\" I said back. \" He may be closer than you think,\" he said. I couldn't really believe this was Stacee Jaxx. He was very much changed, I knew that. He still drank and stuff, but not as much. It seemed weird. \" I don't know. Dreams will be dreams,\" I replied. \" I'll get you a record if you want,\" Stacee recommended. \" Nah, it's alright,\" I replied. The last thing I needed was to be spoiled. I wasn't ever really a spoiled child, unless you count being babysat by Lonny and Dennis and them bribing me with candy spoiled. I miss the old childhood days. \" I'm gonna go back to the tour bus. You coming?\" I asked. \" No, you go ahead,\" Stacee replied. I walked out of the store. I heard singing from a few guys around me. Wow! Pretty woman, walking down the street pretty woman, the kind I'd like to meet Pretty woman, I don't believe you, it must be true no one could look as good as you...mercy! Although I was very much flattered, I ignored them. Pretty woman, won't you pardon me? Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see, pretty woman, you look as lovely as you could be, are you lonely just like me? Argg... I knew they really meant no harm, but I quickened my pace. Pretty woman, stop awhile, pretty woman, talk a while Pretty woman, give your smile to me Pretty woman, yeah yeah yeah. pretty woman look my way Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me 'cause I need you, need you tonight! UH! Pretty woman, don't walk on by, pretty woman, don't make me cry pretty woman, don't walk away, yeah, ok If that's the way it must be, ok I guess I'll go home , it's late, maybe tomorrow night... I reached the tour bus door, opened it, and looked back at the men still on the street. but wait, what do I see? she's walking back to me Wow! Wow! Pretty woman! I slammed close the door and rolled my eyes. \"Sherrie!\" I called out. \" Arsenal, in the bedroom!\" Sherrie yelled back to me. I walked back to our bedroom, where Sherrie had the record player on. She had a worried look plastered on her face. \" Are you alright?\" she asked. \" Yeah. I think I just needed to relieve some stress.\" I took a few steps toward the bathroom. \" I'm going to get ready for bed.\" I walked in and shut the door. Taking a deep breath, I pulled out my razor blade. I still had some stress that needed to be relieved. I was getting better about cutting, though. I only did it every few months when nothing felt right and things like this happened. No one knew I did this. I sat down and pressed the blade against my leg and began to pull. Once the crimson began to draw, I stopped and watched. It was practically pouring out of my leg. I grabbed a few paper towels and pressed them against my thigh. The bleeding eventually stopped, and I bandaged the cut. My legs had scars covering them. They were fading, but they were definitely still there and they still held some dark memories. I got changed and brushed my teeth and all that junk, and went back out to our bunks. Sherrie was already asleep, so I didn't bother her. I sat on my bed and heard something crinkle under my weight. I looked back and saw I was sitting on the edge of a bright yellow bag. I picked it up and opened whatever was inside. It was the Iron Maiden record I was looking at in the record store. I smiled and lightly shook my head. Stacee knew I didn't want to be spoiled. Why'd he get it?[Chapter 3] Chapter #3: The First Concert, Las Vegas It was finally Saturday. The day of the first concert on the schedule, ad our first stop on the tour was Las Vegas. We were in a large building, and Sherrie was helping me get ready. I was nervous. I had been preparing all day on Friday, but I was still horrified I'd fail and get fired. Sherrie had me in a denim skirt that had floral print on it, and an Arsenal tank with a black leather jacket over it. Sherrie was still trying to help me get used to the black boots. They felt fine, but they had a heel on them, which made it hard to walk for me. I finally sat down, frustration taking over. I nearly began to cry. \" Arsenal, what's up?\" Sherrie asked. I took a deep breath. \" What if I mess up? What if I get fired? What if-?\" I stuttered. Sherrie laughed. \" Arsenal, you know that you won't mess up! You were practicing all day yesterday! Now come on, the show is beginning!\" Sherrie stated. I got up as Wolfgang Voncolt (Drew's band) finished up. The lights dimmed down, and I walked out onto the stage by my keyboard. I took a deep breath as I saw Stacee appear. Soon enough, the lights turned bright, I began to play the keyboard to start off the song. The first song was a song I had written. The crowd went nuts and the screams nearly blew out my eardrums. On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes (All your life) all your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you But you were living in another world tryin' to get your message through. I liked those lines. I had written this song for my mom. She always was ignored by my grandpa and grandma (from what she told me), and no one listened to her cry for attention when she deserved it. No one heard a single word you said. They should have seen it in your eyes What was going around your head. My mom left home when she was 16. She was tired of living in the shadows, and she left for Hollywood. No one knew why she left. Ooh, she's a little runaway. Daddy's girl learned fast All those things he couldn't say. Ooh, she's a little runaway. She was a runaway. Take a line every night guaranteed to blow your mind I see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time So you sit home alone 'cause there's nothing left that you can do There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you She got a job as a magazine article writer/ reporter, and she became a big success. You know she likes the lights at nights on the neon Broadway signs She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find She went to Hollywood because she heard many great things about it and she came there for one reason. Love. No one heard a single word she said They should have seen it in your eyes What was going around your head. But, she soon lost her job as a reporter for writing the truth about her job. She began working at the Bourbon, where her friends, Lonny and Dennis, gave her a job. She had known them since she had first arrived in Hollywood. Ooh, she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast All those things he couldn't say My mom got a good job offer as a nurse at the local hospital. She resigned as a waitress and began working there instead. That's all I knew when I asked her. Ooh, she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast Now she works the night away Ooh, she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast All those things he couldn't say Ooh, she's a little runaway Daddy's girl learned fast Now she works the night away I smiled lightly and we began another song, this time it was written by Stacee. Sherrie had told me he sang it at the Bourbon Room. Step inside, walk this way You and me babe, Hey, hey! Ok,then... Love is like a bomb, baby, c'mon get it on Livin' like a lover with a radar phone Lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp Demolition woman, can I be your man? Razzle 'n' a dazzle 'n' a flash a little light Television lover, baby, go all night Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet Little miss ah innocent sugar me, yeah Well then... Hey! C'mon, take a bottle, shake it up Break the bubble, break it up Pour some sugar on me Ooh, in the name of love Pour some sugar on me C'mon, fire me up Pour your sugar on me Oh, I can't get enough I'm hot, sticky sweet From my head to my feet, yeah Yup. Definitely the Stacee Jaxx I new before. Listen! red light, yellow light, green-a-light go! Crazy little woman in a one man show Mirror queen, mannequin, rhythm of love Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up You gotta squeeze a little, squeeze a little Tease a little more Easy operator come a knockin' on my door Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet Little miss innocent sugar me, yeah, yeah Give a little more Take a bottle, shake it up Break the bubble, break it up Pour some sugar on me Ooh, in the name of love Pour some sugar on me C'mon fire me up Pour your sugar on me Oh, I can't get enough I'm hot, sticky sweet From my head to my feet yeah One word. Explicit. You got the peaches, I got the cream Sweet to taste, saccharine 'cause I'm hot, say what, sticky sweet From my head, my head, to my feet Do you take sugar? one lump or two? Take a bottle, shake it up Break the bubble, break it up Pour some sugar on me Ooh, in the name of love Pour some sugar on me C'mon fire me up Pour your sugar on me Oh, I can't get enough Pour some sugar on me Oh, in the name of love Pour some sugar on me Get it, come get it Pour your sugar on me Ooh Pour some sugar on me Yeah! Sugar me! Definitely one of Stacee's songs, that's for sure. Next was mine. It was the one I had been working on about my dad. I should have known better Than to let you go alone, It's times like these I can't make it on my own Wasted days, and sleepless nights And I can't wait to see you again I find I spend my time Waiting on your call, How can I tell you, baby My back's against the wall I need you by my side To tell me it's alright, 'Cos I don't think I can take anymore Stacee signaled to me, as if he wanted me to join him in singing. I happily did. Let me explain those lyrics. I've been waiting to talk to my dad for 14 years. I needed him when I was feeling down, so he could tell me it was going to be alright. Is this love that I'm feeling, Is this the love, that I've been searching for Is this love or am I dreaming, This must be love, 'Cos it's really got a hold on me, A hold on me... I can't stop the feeling I've been this way before But, with you I've found the key To open any door I can feel my love for you Growing stronger day by day, An' I can't wait to see you again So I can hold you in my arms Is this love that I'm feeling, Is this the love, that I've been searching for Is this love or am I dreaming, This must be love, 'Cos it's really got a hold on me, A hold on me... Is this love that I'm feeling, Is this the love, that I've been searching for... Is this love or am I dreaming, Is this the love, that I've been searching for... I was getting better at this concert thing. It was fun, actually. Stacee began on the song I had written. If you've got love in your sights Watch out, love bites If you've got love in your sights make love, do you look in the mirror? Who do you think of, does he look like me? Do you tell lies and say that it's forever? Do you think twice, or just touch 'n' see? Ooh babe ooh yeah I wrote that about my ex. No, we never did IT, I never let it get that far. BUT, I caught him doing it with some other chick. I wrote this after we broke up. I made a few edits, but it was still pretty good. When you're alone, do you let go? Are you wild 'n' willin' or is it just for show? Ooh c'mon I don't wanna touch you too much baby 'Cos making love to you might drive me crazy I know you think that love is the way you make it So I don't wanna be there when you decide to break it No! Love bites, love bleeds It's bringin' me to my knees Love lives, love dies It's no surprise Love begs, love pleads It's what I need When I'm with you are you somewhere else? Am I gettin' thru or do you please yourself? When you wake up will you walk out? It can't be love if you throw it about Ooh babe I don't wanna touch you too much baby 'Cos making love to you might drive me crazy Ooh yeah Love bites, love bleeds It's bringin' me to my knees Love lives, love dies If you've got love in your sights Watch out, love bites Yes it does It will be hell I did not like love that much. It always stabbed me in the heart. Pain, hurt, rejection, and sadness was what it caused. It's all the same, only the names will change Everyday it seems we're wasting away Another place where the faces are so cold I'd drive all night just to get back home I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride I'm wanted dead or alive Wanted dead or alive Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days And the people I meet always go their separate ways Sometimes you tell the day By the bottle that you drink And times when you're alone all you do is think I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back I been everywhere, and I'm standing tall I've seen a million faces an I've rocked them all I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride I'm wanted dead or alive I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side I'm wanted dead or alive And I ride, dead or alive I still drive, dead or alive Dead or alive [x4] Sherrie told me Stacee wrote that song at the Bourbon Room. Once upon a time Not so long ago Tommy used to work on the docks Union's been on strike He's down on his luck...it's tough, so tough Gina works the diner all day Working for her man, she brings home her pay For love - for love She says we've got to hold on to what we've got 'Cause it doesn't make a difference If we make it or not We've got each other and that's a lot For love - we'll give it a shot Whooah, we're half way there Livin' on a prayer Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear Livin' on a prayer Tommy's got his six string in hock Now he's holding in what he used To make it talk - so tough, it's tough Gina dreams of running away When she cries in the night Tommy whispers baby it's okay, someday We've got to hold on to what we've got 'Cause it doesn't make a difference If we make it or not We've got each other and that's a lot For love - we'll give it a shot We've got to hold on ready or not You live for the fight when it's all that you've got Good job, Stacee. I had helped him write that song yesterday. Only a few more songs to go. This ain't a song for the broken-hearted No silent prayer for the faith-departed I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd You're gonna hear my voice When I shout it out loud It's my life It's now or never I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while I'm alive (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway Like Frankie said I did it my way I just wanna live while I'm alive It's my life This is for the ones who stood their ground For Tommy and Gina who never backed down Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake Luck ain't even lucky Got to make your own breaks It's my life And it's now or never I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while I'm alive (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway Like Frankie said I did it my way I just want to live while I'm alive 'Cause it's my life Better stand tall when they're calling you out Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down It's my life And it's now or never 'Cause I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while I'm alive (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway Like Frankie said I did it my way I just want to live while I'm alive It's my life And it's now or never 'Cause I ain't gonna live forever I just want to live while I'm alive (It's my life) My heart is like an open highway Like Frankie said I did it my way I just want to live while I'm alive 'Cause it's my life! Only 3 more songs and then it'll be over. My fingers were dancing all over the keyboard. I guess this time you're really leaving I heard your suitcase say goodbye Well as my broken heart lies bleeding you say true love is suicide You say you've cried a thousand rivers And now you're swimming for the shore You left me drowning in my tears And you won't save me anymore Now I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl I'll be there for you These five words I swear to you When you breathe I want to be the air for you I'll be there for you I'd live and I'd die for you I'd steal the sun from the sky for you Words can't say what love can do I'll be there for you I know you know we've had some good times Now they have their own hiding place Well I can promise you tomorrow But I can't buy back yesterday And Baby you know my hands are dirty But I wanted to be your valentine I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby When you get drunk, I'll be the wine I'll be there for you These five words I swear to you When you breathe I want to be the air for you I'll be there for you I'd live and I'd die for you Steal the sun from the sky for you Words can't say what a love can do I'll be there for you And I wasn't there when you were happy I wasn't there when you were down I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out I'll be there for you These five words I swear to you When you breathe I want to be the air for you I'll be there for you I'd live and I'd die for you Steal the sun from the sky for you Words can't say what a love can do I'll be there for you That song brought tears to my eyes. It reminded me of my father. I had wrote it for him. An angel's smile is what you sell You promise me heaven, then put me through hell Chains of love got a hold on me When passion's a prison, you can't break free You're a loaded gun There's nowhere to run No one can save me The damage is done Shot through the heart And you're to blame You give love a bad name I play my part and you play your game You give love a bad name You give love a bad name Paint your smile on your lips Blood red nails on your fingertips A school boy's dream, you act so shy Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye You're a loaded gun There's nowhere to run No one can save me The damage is done Shot through the heart And you're to blame You give love a bad name I play my part and you play your game You give love a bad name You give love a bad na me Last song! Just a small town girl Livin' in a lonely world She took the midnight train Goin' anywhere Just a city boy Born and raised in South Detroit He took the midnight train Goin' anywhere A singer in a smokey room A smell of wine and cheap perfume For a smile they can share the night It goes on and on and on and on Strangers waiting Up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching In the night Streetlights, people Livin' just to find emotion Hidin', somewhere in the night Workin' hard to get my fill Everybody wants a thrill Payin' anything to roll the dice Just one more time Some will win Some will lose Some were born to sing the blues Oh, the movie never ends It goes on and on and on and on Stacee gave out a call to Sherrie and Drew, and soon enough they came out on stage and began singing along with Stacee and me. Strangers waiting Up and down the boulevard Their shadows searching In the night Streetlights, people Livin' just to find emotion Hidin', somewhere in the night Don't stop believin' Hold on to the feelin' Streetlights, people Don't stop believin' Hold on Streetlights, people The lights grew brighter, and the crowd was going crazy. The lights dimmed, and we headed off the stage. Sherrie hugged me tightly. \" You did great!\" she said. I smiled. \" You too!\" I couldn't believe I had done so well. And for my first concert. Stacee Jaxx came over to us. \" Great job, Arsenal, Sherrie.\" I replied by saying,\" Thanks.\" He gave a single nod and walked back to his dressing room. Sherrie turned back to me and asked,\" Did you write a few of those songs?\" \" Yeah, actually,\" I answered. She smiled and slapped my arm lightly. \" See? Now are you happy that I gave him your song book?\" \" Wait, you gave it to him?\" I asked. She nodded slyly. \" Sherrie...you're lucky you're like my sister.\" She smiled more. \" I don't think you know how proud Carrie is,\" Sherrie said. Carrie was my mom's name. \" Yeah, she probably misses me. I'm not usually away from her,\" I stated. Sherrie opened her mouth to reply, but frowned. And Sherrie never frowned. I turned around to see what or WHO she was frowning at. It was a man with blonde hair back in a ponytail and deep brown eyes. Something about him seemed...off. \" Sherrie, who's that?\" I asked. \" That's Garrett, Arsenal's manager.\" \" What? I don't have a manager.\" \" It's the band, weirdo.\" I nodded and flushed at my stupidity. \" Anyways, he's a real jerk. I don't understand why Stacee doesn't fire him. He's tried coming onto me!\" Sherrie whispered. \" Ew,\" I replied, making a face. Sherrie nodded. \" Come on. We need to get changed,\" Sherrie said, pulling me into our dressing room. I got out of my outfit and changed into a light orange dress with my black converse and a jean jacket. Sherrie was in a black dress with heels. \" Wanna go shopping?\" Sherrie asked. \" ...Ok. But, I need to grab my purse from the bus,\" I said. \" I'll wait here,\" Sherrie replied, sitting in a chair. I ran out of the room and down a long hall. I opened the door at the end and felt the cool air hit my face. Ignoring it, I ran over to the bus and opened the door. I walked slowly down the hall, and I heard voices. I stopped to listen. \" Garrett, I know she is. She's gotta be.\" It was Stacee. \" How do you know for sure?\" Garrett asked. \" I just...do,\" Stacee replied. What were they talking about? \" There's only one way to know for sure. We'll have to go for blood work,\" Garrett said more like a fact than an opinion. Hmph. I went into my room and grabbed my black shoulder bag. When I went back into the hall, however, the voices had faded, as if they had never been there before. I was confused. What had they been talking about? What was exactly happening?[Chapter 4] Chapter #4: The Hospital \" ARSENAL! COME ON!\" Drew yelled through the bathroom door. \"NO!\" I yelled back. Sherrie, Drew, Garrett, and Stacee wanted me to go to the hospital for blood work. Whenever I got near blood, I was for sure to faint. Drew even knew that because of this one time when he watched me. He accidentally cut himself with letter opener, and his finger began to bleed. I ended up throwing up and fainting. Ironic, isn't it? When I'd cut, blood would pour, but I'd never EVER faint. That's one of the reasons why I stopped. Or, well, not cut as much. \" Arsenal, it'll be ok!\" Sherrie assured. \" NO IT WON'T! Last time I saw blood, I fainted! There is no way in HELL I am going in there!\" I yelled. They couldn't make me even go. Why did I have to get blood work done? \" Arsenal, calm down. It'll be fine,\" Stacee said. I could almost hear him rolling his eyes. I leaned back against the door. Only the lock on the door and myself were keeping them from coming in here. \" Arsenal, I will beat down this door!\" Drew warned. \" Drew, I will jump out this window,\" I shot back. Yes, there was a small window in the bathroom. \" Arsenal, just come on!\" Garrett said.\" I will get Stacee's body guard's out here!\" I sighed. I didn't think I was gonna win this battle. I unlocked the door and cracked it slightly. \" I swear to god...\" I mumbled. \" Good girl. Now come on,\" Garrett said. I shot him a death glare. I didn't like him at all. Even after about a month and a half, I still didn't. Drew grabbed my upper left arm. Great. He pulled me out of the bathroom and Stacee grabbed my other arm. No escaping now... They lifted me off the ground and carried me off of the bus. I looked back at Sherrie. She had her head down. We got into a limo, and even in there, Stacee and Drew wouldn't let go, and Stacee's body guards kept their eyes on me at all times. \" Don't let go. She can find a way to escape. Trust me,\" Drew said. \" You guys are mean,\" I mumbled. We finally got to the hospital, and I had to admit, even in Austin, Texas, the hospitals were HUGE. Bigger than any one I've ever seen. Once again, I was lifted up and taken inside, and for some reason, the guards stayed near the limo, most likely to keep fans away. I began to breathe heavily. A nurse came up to us. \" Can I help you?\" she asked with a southern drawl. \" We have an appointment for Arsenal Jackson today,\" Garrett said. Wait...they planned this? The nurse checked her clip board. \" Oh! Arsenal,...ARSENAL!\" the lady yelled. Oh god. She must've been a big fan. She kept her calm, though. \" Right this way,\" she squeaked. She led us down a winding hall and to a door. Stacee and Drew set me down on a chair, and I began to feel dizzy. I looked at the window. \" Arsenal, don't you dare,\" Drew said. I looked at him for a long while, then in a flash, got up and ran to the window. \" DAMNIT, ARSENAL!\" Drew yelled. He pulled me back. I began kicking him. \" Ow! Arsenal, quit it! OW!\" Stacee grabbed my feet, keeping me from kicking my feet. \" Let go!\" I yelled. \" Arsenal, it'll be fine. Calm down!\" Sherrie said. The nurse, who had left, came back in with a mask and tank. \" NO!\" I yelled. I bit the Stacee's hand. \" OW!\" \" HOLD HER DOWN!\" the nurse yelled. Drew pinned me down to the small cot in the room and the lady placed the mask over my mouth and nose. I began to relax and feel dizzy. They had put me on that laugh-gas stuff. I blinked a few times and the nurse removed the mask. Drew told me what had happened while I was on the laughy gas, and well, here it goes. I had begun to play with Sherrie's hair, since she was closest to me. \" What's wrong with her?\" Sherrie asked. \" It's laughing gas. It should keep her under a 'drunk-state' for a while,\" the nurse explained. Sherrie nodded as I began to giggle. I poked her nose. She grew irritated, and Stacee said,\" You can take my spot.\" \" The doctor will be here shortly,\" the nurse said, walking out. I had begun to roll around on the cot. I soon fell off. \" Oh god,\" Drew groaned. \" Well, you have to admit, she warned us,\" Sherrie shrugged. The doctor came into the room. \" Okay, Ms. Jackson?\" the doctor asked, staring down at me on the ground. \" I assume the laughing gas?\" \" Yeah,\" Garrett said. He nodded. \" Well, that's quite alright. Most of the patients here use it, anyways. She's one of the best ones to use it,\" the doctor explained. \" Ok, just set her onto that chair.\" Stacee grabbed under my underarms and dragged me over to the chair. The doctor checked both arms for the most blood, and my right had more. He wrapped the upper arm in a purple band and stuck a needle into my arm. I had gasped slightly, but my head only moved to the side. A small tube filled with crimson, and the doctor pulled out the needle and put a bandage onto my arm. \" Ok, Mr. Jaxx, we will call you when the results come in,\" the doctor stated, leading us out of the room, Stacee dragging me along as I mumbled odd things. \" Will she be alright?\" Sherrie asked. \" Yes, just give her a few hours and she will return back to normal,\" the doctor said. He walked off without another word. Stacee had dragged me along, and I kept trying to walk off towards the nurses' area. From what Drew had told me, Stacee got irritated and just slung me over his shoulder. So now, a few hours later, I was back to normal again, and Drew had told me everything. I couldn't help but laugh a little when he told me. It sounded like something that would happen to me. But, I still had one question on my mind. \" Drew?\" I asked. \" What?\" he asked. \" Why did I have to get blood work done and no one else?\" I asked. He looked taken aback for a minute, as if he couldn't think of a response. \" That's for someone else to explain,\" Drew stated, placing a hand on my shoulder. I smiled lightly and looked at Drew. His eyes were really beautiful...what? No! Arsenal, how dare you! He's Sherrie's! He looked at me with a different look. His face grew closer. Oh no. Please. I can't lose Sherrie because I kissed Drew. Just as his lips nearly touched mine, I heard a yell from the living room. \" OH MY GOD! IT'S TRUE! I KNEW IT!\" It was Sherrie. Drew pulled back suddenly, and so did I. Thanks, Sherrie. :) \" Uh...let's not-\" \" Yeah...good idea.\" We ran out of Drew's room and into the living room. Sherrie and Garrett were staring at a piece of paper in Stacee's hand. As soon as they saw me, however, they quickly hid the paper. \" What's going on?\" I asked. \" Uh...nothin'...\" Sherrie mumbled. \" Yeah, right. Tell me,\" I said. She nodded 'no'. I got really mad. \" Why don't you guys tell me anything?\" I demanded. \" You're the youngest,\" Garrett said. \" So? That doesn't mean I'm a baby!\" I glared at them all. \" Ok! Let's go outside,\" Garrett said, pushing me over to the door. \" What? No! You guys are being unfair!\" I said. He opened the door and walked out. As soon as I made it onto firm ground, Garrett shut the door. I whipped around and beat on it. It was locked now. \" HEY! THIS ISN'T FAIR! I HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW!\" I cried. Why couldn't I know? It was my life and my blood, for god's sake! I leaned against the side of the bus and began to cry. Life was unfair. I decided to go over to the park behind the bus, which was across the street. I walked over to it and sat down on a swing and looked at the moon. Why did everyone lie to me? My mom, Sherrie, Drew, everyone. I was tired of all the lies. I wanted the truth. Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, And think of you Caught up in circles confusion - Is nothing new Flashback - warm nights - Almost left behind I looked away as fresh tears cascaded down my face. Suitcases of memories, Time after - Sometimes you picture me - I'm walking too far ahead You're calling to me, I can't hear What you've said - Then you say - go slow - I fall behind - The second hand unwinds If you're lost you can look - and you will find me Time after time If you fall I will catch you - I'll be waiting Time after time I got up from the swing and made my way over to the slide. I climbed up to the top and sat down. After my picture fades and darkness has Turned to gray Watching through windows - you're wondering If I'm OK Secrets stolen from deep inside The drum beats out of time - If you're lost you can look and you will find me time after time if you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting, Time after time You said go slow - I fall behind The second hand unwinds - If you're lost you can look and you will find me time after time if you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting time after time ...Time after time Time after time Time after time Time after time... I was tired of all the lies. Of the people. Of...my dad. I was just sick of it. I cried even more just thinking about it. I went down the slide and climbed up the large oak tree across from it. I just wanted to jump down and break my neck. Just...screw it. It didn't matter anymore, anyways. \" I'm done, world. Dad. I'm done with all of it. Take me. Show me a sign, please,\" I mumbled. Something happened. A german shepherd down at the trunk of the tree. It barked up to me, as if telling me to climb down. \" Go away,\" I cried. It tilted its head and sat down, as if it was waiting for me now. I sighed, realizing this dog wouldn't let me do anything. I crawled back down and sat against the tree trunk. The dog sat by me. \" Who's your owner?\" I asked. She whimpered. I looked at her neck. No collar. Poor girl. \" No home,\" I mumbled. I felt her fur. It was fluffy and warm, shockingly. I ran my hands through it. I heard someone walking towards me. I looked up and saw Drew and Stacee. \" Oh...it's you ,\" I spat. Drew sighed. \" Arsenal, we're sorry,\" Stacee said. \" Then why can't I know? And why did you kick me outside? You guys aren't who I'd thought you were,\" I said. \"You will know soon enough, I promise,\" Stacee assured. Drew noticed the dog. \" Where'd the dog come from?\" \" I don't know. She found me and wouldn't leave me alone until I came down from the tree and saw her,\" I shrugged. Drew hunched down and pet her soft fur. She licked his hand. Drew smiled. \" I like her. Who does she belong to?\" \" No one. She doesn't have a collar.\" Drew looked at Stacee. \" I kind of want to take her with us,\" Drew said, looking at Stacee. I had wanted to also. She was such a sweet stray dog. \" Give him the innocent eyes,\" Drew whispered to me. I did it. I gave him my world-famous innocent eyes. AND, Stacee fell right into the trap. \" Fine. What's her name?\" Stacee sighed. The dog came in between my arms and licked Stacee's hand. \" Her name's Bolt,\" I smiled. I noticed Hey Man running towards us. He ran up to Bolt and jumped onto her back. I at first thought he was going to hurt her, but instead, he sat there and pet her fur. I was still angry at Stacee and everyone else, but at least they let me keep Bolt. But, even they knew that I wanted answers. And quick.[Chapter 5] Chapter #5: Memories I woke up with Bolt staring at me from my bedside. I gasped when I opened my eyes and blinked a few times. I heard Sherrie toss from above me. Bolt whimpered and pelted out of the room. I sat up and went over to my dresser. Sherrie had already laid out clothes for me to wear, which I assumed she did last night. She had laid out a dress that was lime green with black lace covering it, with a skull design on the top. She also had my black converse out and black tights. After I slipped that on, I noticed Sherrie in the mirror behind me. She was propped up on an elbow, looking at me. \" You look cute,\" she said. \" Thanks,\" I replied. She hopped off of the bunk and played with my hair. \" You have so much hair,\" she stated. \" I know,\" I replied. She laid it down my back. \" I'm taking you shopping today,\" she said, getting dressed. Ok. I could deal with that. I grabbed my shoulder bag and Sherrie got dressed and all that junk. She took my hand and led me down the hall. Drew was sitting in the living room with Bolt, who had run out after I had woken up. He was playing with her. \" Where's Stacee?\" Sherrie asked. \" He's still asleep,\" Drew replied. Sherrie nodded and looked through her purse. \" Shit! Arsenal, wait here!\" Sherrie said, running back to the bunk room. I sighed and sat down by Drew. \" How's your day been?\" he asked. \" Better than most.\" He nodded and I stared at the wall. I soon drifted off into La-La land. I was heading towards the Bourbon Room. A thirteen year-old me walked down the street, Walkman in hand, humming lightly. It was night, and I was supposed to go and hang out with Dennis and Lonny while my mom was working the shift at the hospital. All of the rockers and prostitutes were out on the streets, and I was now across from the Bourbon. A small crowd was gathered around the entrance; the church crowd. I pulled off my headphones and shoved them into my shoulder bag, my records in the other hand (which was in a small suitcase). A man came up to me. He had brown hair. \" Hey...what's your name?\" he asked. \"Arsenal,\" I replied. \" Nice name.\" I smiled slightly. He then reached down for my suitcase. \" HEY! NO!\" I yelled. He pulled towards himself, and I was being dragged along. I heard a male voice across the street yell,\" HEY!\" My grip finally loosened and he ran off with the suitcase while I fell over, my bag falling onto the ground and spilling my things out. \" No,\" I cried. \" My records...\" I bent down to get my things, and someone ran over to me. I looked up and saw a boy with curly brown hair and brown eyes. \" Are you hurt? Are you alright?\" he asked, bending down to help me out. \" Yeah...he stole my records...\" I mumbled, tears running down my face. \" This sucks.\" He put a hand on my shoulder. \" Hey, it'll be alright. You can get records again.\" I shrugged and sighed. \" I'm Drew,\" the boy said. \" Arsenal,\" I replied, stuffing the rest of my bag. He smiled. \" I like your name.\" I smiled back. \" Where are you heading?\" Drew asked. \" The Bourbon.\" \" Oh, really? I work there now!\" Drew exclaimed. I smiled slightly, and he helped me up. \" Did you just move here?\" I asked. \" Yeah,\" he replied. We walked across the street and into the Bourbon, which didn't have too many people tonight, considering it was a Monday. Lonny, who was sitting on a bar stool, came over to us. He must've noticed how my face was red, because he said,\" Arsenal, what's wrong?\" \" Someone mugged her,\" Drew said for me. \" Oh,\" Lonny replied. \" Well, I'm sure they'll show up eventually.\" I nodded slightly. \" Ah, I see you've met Drew,\" Dennis said, walking over to us. \" Yeah. He saw me get mugged and helped me out,\" I said. Dennis's face dropped. \"Stupid people,\" he mumbled. Just then, my mother, Carrie, ran into the Bourbon. \" Arsenal!\" she said. She walked over to us. \" My shift is over.\" She looked at Drew with confusion. \" Oh! That's Drew,\" Dennis said. My mom nodded and shook hands with Drew. \" Mom, someone stole my records...\" I trailed off. \" What? Did you get mugged?\" she asked. I nodded. \" Drew helped me, though,\" I added. \" Thank you, Drew. For helping Arsenal,\" my mom said to Drew. \" It's no problem,\" Drew said. \" Do you have a place to stay?\" I asked. I knew if my mom knew if he had no where to stay, she would let him stay with us. \" Uh...no.\" \" Mom, can Drew stay with us?\" I asked. She looked at me. Drew looked a little hopeful himself. She sighed. \" There's no way out of this, is there?\" she asked. I smiled real big, and so did Drew. \" Come on, you two,\" she said, smiling. She turned around and Drew gave me a quick hug. \" Thank you,\" he said. \" No problem,\" I had replied. Sherrie walked back into the room with glasses on. \" Come on, Arsenal,\" she said. She grabbed my hand and led me out onto the street. \" Have you been having a good day so far?\" Sherrie asked. \" Yeah...why does everyone keep asking that?\" I replied. \" Well, I'm just wondering. Plus I need to tell you something,\" Sherrie responded, turning down the street. \" What is it?\" I asked. \" I'll tell you soon enough,\" Sherrie replied,\" Oh. Put these glasses on. People won't recognize you and attack you if they don't think you're famous.\" And that was the end of our conversation. As I put on the glasses, I zoned off once again, but this time, it was when I met Sherrie. \" Damnit!\" I heard someone yell from the bar at the Bourbon. I looked up from the table I was sitting at and saw a girl with blonde hair looking at a tray that had tipped over and broke all the glasses. I got up after setting down my book and hurried over to the bar. \" Are you ok?\" I asked, watching as she cleaned up the glass. I picked up a few pieces that landed on the bar. She looked up and said,\" Yeah.\" \" Here, I'll help you,\" I offered. She didn't reply, so I got down on my hands and knees and picked up some of the glass. She then said,\" You don't have to help me.\" \" No, I want to. My name's Arsenal. I always come here,\" I introduced. The girl looked up. \" Arsenal? Like the band?\" she asked. \" Yeah,\" I smiled. \" That's my favorite band. I'm Sherrie,\" she replied. \" So did you get a job here?\" \" Yes. Just last night.\" \" I figured. Have you met Drew yet? He's my friend.\" \" Yeah,\" she got a dreamy look in her eyes. \" I think someone likes Drew,\" I sang. She blushed. \" He asked me out on a date tonight,\" she mumbled. \" What are you going to wear?\" \" Well, I honestly don't have anything so I think I'll just wear whatever I have.\" \" Hm... I can give you a dress I have, if you want it. I won't be in town tomorrow because I'm going to a concert. I'm mad because I won't see Arsenal now,\" I said. \" Really? You'd let me use a dress?\" she asked. \" Of course.\" I finished cleaning up the glass and I threw them into a garbage bin. \" We can go now if you want. Or I can run home and get the dress.\" \" Either way will work.\" I snapped out of my little trance when I saw a hand go flying across my face. \" Hello? Earth to Arsenal!\" Sherrie giggled. \" Oh. Sorry.\" \" We're here. Do you want to look at clothes or check out the record store?\" Sherrie asked. \" How about we get clothes and then records,\" I suggested. Sherrie nodded and we headed towards a clothing store. I ended up getting two dresses (Sherrie's choice), three rock band shirts, a new denim skirt, and a pair of light and dark jeans. I also got a new pair of converse and vans. We began walking away from the store and across the main entrance. People were pushing eagerly through the crowd. \" What do you think's going on?\" Sherrie asked as she nearly got knocked over by a group of girls. \" Let's follow them and see,\" I said. Sherrie nodded and we followed everyone until we reached a large crowd. We pushed through it until we reached the middle. Music began to play followed by someone singing. Why, you wanna tell me how to live my life? Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white? Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand. Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man? My daddy lived the lie, that's just the price that he paid Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away. I pushed Sherrie and myself to the front of the crowd and up to the stage. A boy who looked to be around my age was singing. He had poofy sandy brown hair and dark blue eyes (looks like Jon Bon Jovi XD). He was wearing a button-down shirt which exposed his chest, which had a six-pack of abs. His voice was good and strong. Ohhh, if there's one thing I hang onto, That gets me through the night. I ain't gonna do what I don't want to, I'm gonna live my life. Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice, Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly. When the world gets in my face, I say, Have A Nice Day. Have A Nice Day Take a look around you; nothing's what it seems We're living in the broken home of hopes and dreams, Let me be the first to shake a helping hand. Anybody brave enough to take a stand, I've knocked on every door, on every dead end street, Looking for forgiveness, what's left to believe? Ohhh, if there's one thing I hang onto, That gets me through the night. I ain't gonna do what I don't want to, I'm gonna live my life. Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice, Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly. When the world gets in my face, I say, Have A Nice Day. Have A Nice Day. Ohhh, if there's one thing I hang onto, That gets me through the night. I ain't gonna do what I don't want to, I'm gonna live my life. Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice, Standing on the ledge, I show the wind how to fly. When the world gets in my face, I say, Have A Nice Day. Have A Nice Day. Have A Nice Day. Have A Nice Day. Have A Nice Day. When The world keeps trying, to drag me down, I gotta raise my hands, I'm gonna stand my ground. Well I say, Have A Nice Day. Have A Nice Day Have A Nice Day Everyone clapped, including Arsenal, who couldn't keep her eyes off of him. He looked across the crowd and his eyes met Arsenal's. He looked at her for a long time. He was pulled off the stage by one of his band-mates. \" Who was that?\" Sherrie asked as the crowd departed. \" I don't know, but he was cute,\" Arsenal said. \" I think you have a crush,\" Sherrie sang. \" Maybe.\" I felt my cheeks go red. \" Is that Arsenal Jackson?\" someone yelled. \" Sherrie! I thought the glasses would work!\" I whispered. \" They are! Shit!\" she whispered back. Screams of joy began to sound, followed by people running back at them. \" SHIT!\" Arsenal yelled. She grabbed Sherrie's hand and they ran off as fast as day. \" Where are we going to hide?\" Sherrie asked quickly. \" Didn't think of that,\" I said, shoulders beginning to sag slightly. I felt someone grab my upper-arm and pull Sherrie and I into a store. Many people went pelting past, and when they were gone, Sherrie sat down on a bench in the store. \" Thank you,\" I panted, out of breath. I looked up and saw the same boy that had been singing earlier. \" No problem. I'm guessing you're Arsenal Jackson and Sherrie?\" \" Yes.\" \" I like your keyboarding and writing skills,\" he said to us. \" Thanks. What's your name?\" \" Jon.\" \" Nice name.\" Sherrie stood up. \" Well...I'm going to head back to the tour bus. I guess I'll see you later.\" She winked at me before running off. I turned to Jon who asked,\" Do you want to, I don't know, go to the record store with me?\" \" Sure,\" I said with a smile. And so, Jon led the way out of the store and to the records.[Chapter 6] Hello guys! I know, you may be wondering 'this story is completed; why is she posting something?'.

This is the second oc story in the WC archieve I think. Disclaimer – I do not own Wild Child. Dani and all plot changes are my own, but nothing you recognize. \"Morning Miss Poppy\" Daniella Brown pulled the giant curtains Poppy Moore's room apart, letting the startlingly bright light from the morning sun shine upon the sleeping girl's face. \"Dani, not now\" Poppy moaned from her comfy bed. The red-head sighed at walked over to the teenager, yanking off the comforter from the bed and stealing the pillow from under Poppy's head. \"Dani!\" Poppy cried, sitting up. The difference between the two girls was comical, especially at this time in the morning. Poppy had long blond hair, tan skin, and wore a skimpy pink nightgown that didn't cover much. Her day clothes were not much different: designer labels galore, skimpy shorts and skirts, skinny jeans, thin shirts, only the highest heels, and thousands of sunglasses. Dani, already dressed for the day, wore her usual dark colored knee-length pencil skirt with a matching jacket and a white blouse, paired with her black stiletto heels, her only indulgence. Her startling bright red hair was pinned back in a tight bun, so you could tell neither the length nor the style of it, and the shade was dulled. Not a speck of make-up was worn on the teenager, and she had thick-framed glassed hiding her eyes. \"Remember, Miss Rosemary is moving in today, Miss Poppy\" Dani reminded the other girl in her light, British accent. \"Shit\" \"Molly? Molly!\" Poppy called as she headed downstairs, Dani on her heels. Poppy's little sister was in the kitchen making herself food while listening to music. \"Molly!\" finally having enough, Poppy pulled one of the ear buds out of Molly's ear. \"Hey, I was listening to that!\" Molly protested. \"Earth calling sisterling. Have you forgotten today's the day Rosemary moves in?\" Poppy asked as if it was the end of the world. Her world, maybe. \"Like you'd let me forget. Morning Dani\" the younger brunette greeted the red-head. \"Morning Miss Molly\" Molly turned back to her sister. \"Please tell me you're not going to do anything crazy\" she pleaded. \"Look, you know I love you, Mollster, but there are some things you're just way too young to understand\" Molly and Dani looked down to see Poppy cutting the crust off of Molly's PB and J. \"I know what I'm doing, though, okay? Trust me\" \"Poppy!\" Molly cried in frustration, but Poppy only smile patronizingly before walking away. \"Dani\" Molly groaned, but Dani shook her head. \"Molly, you know better than I do that when Poppy gets an idea in her head, there's no talking her out of it\" \"That doesn't mean you have to go along with it\" Molly cried. She hated watching Dani get ordered around and walked over by Poppy's friends and always getting in trouble for things Poppy did. \"You know that's not true\" Dani sighed. \"Besides, Poppy isn't all that bad\" Molly rolled her eyes, but dropped the argument. \"I need to go and help Poppy\" Dani sighed, knowing what Poppy was planning, and hating it. The driver opened the back of the moving truck and Poppy announced to her 'friends' \"All right, guys. Let's give my dad's girlfriend the perfect Malibu welcome. Everyone, help yourselves!\" People rushed forward and started grabbing boxes, passing them back to get torn apart. Dani stood on the balcony above, watching, not wanting anything to do with Poppy's so-called party. Miss Rosemary was nice enough, and she couldn't understand why Poppy was so horrible to her. \"Have you seen what Poppy's done?\" Molly cried as Dani came up next to her. Dani sighed, something she did a lot in her life while it revolved around Poppy. \"Never mind, of course you did. At least you're not helping her\" Molly added before Dani could say anything. \"I'm going to my room, tell me if anything interesting happens\" Molly said, leaving Dani to watch the destruction. Dani watched as Poppy jumped off the patio and into the ocean. \"Welcome to Malibu, biatch!\" Poppy's voice echoed when she reappeared. Just then, she noticed Mr. Moore going through the crowd to look over the edge at Poppy. \"get up here, right now. Get up here!\" he ordered. \"That is the final straw, Poppy!\" Mr. Moore shouted as he ushered people to go home. \"You are going to England!\" \"Yawn, the boarding school threat again\" Poppy shouted back, completely calm. \"I don't even recognize you anymore\" Mr. Moore replied. \"All this is going to stop right now!\" \"So what, big deal. You can just replace me with a newer, trashier version, like you did with Mom!\" Poppy cried back. Dani nodded. So that was why she hated miss Rosemary. Dani shok her head and headed inside, pulling out her truck to pack. If Poppy was going to boarding school, so was she. \"I take it you're planning on going with Poppy\" Dani turned around, not startled at all to see Mr. Moore standing in her doorway. She simply gave him an are-you-kidding-me look. He sighed as stepped inside, sitting down at the foot of her bed, next to where she had set out some of the things she was taking. \"You know, I can't understand you. You are such a good girl, you just need to get over your confidence issues\" he ran a hand through his hair. Dani still said nothing. \"Alright, you can go with Poppy. But please, just try. You're not the hired help, you know. You're part of the family\" Dani nodded, making sure not to make any promises, before he walked out of the room. He didn't even have to glance around the room. Dani kept so few things; it was easy to believe she could pack everything she owned and still have room in her trunk. Her room was a plain white color, and her carpet was just the generic grey that came with the house. There was nothing personal in the room, except for two things. One was a photo of Dani with a young, blond boy. It was her best friend, Ron. Gerry knew Ron would be stopping by to see Dani soon. Ron was the only thing Dani had to herself that wasn't by Poppy's orders. The other was a picture of a red-haired man with a straggly, short beard holding a petite brunette woman in his arms. They were both smiling and laughing, their love shining clearly in their eyes. It was Dani's parents. \"I suppose it's nice to be going home, kind of\" Dani was sitting on the floor, leaning against her bed while Ron was on his side, lounging on her bed, his head right above her's and slightly to the side. \"Dani, no offence love, but you're a door mat\" Ron told her bluntly. Dani huffed. \"I know that, but it's not like I can help it. It's easy around you, you don't intimidate me. Poppy, well, she's another story. She's changed, into this horrible, bitter person\" Dani ranted. \"She misses her mom, and feels like she's the only person that remembers her. And with Rosemary moving in, she feels as if her father is replacing her mother\" Ron rationalized. Dani turned her torso to glare at him. \"Well, if you're so sympathetic, who don't you go talk to her\" she snapped. Ron gave her a look, and Dani's expression softened as she turned back around and plopped back against her bed. \"Sorry. You know, Poppy's boyfriend is a cheating pig. You'd be so much better for her. And I'm sure she's like you if you just told her\" Dani said softly. \"You and I both know that's not true. Part of what you said is right, Poppy's not that great a person right now. I think she just needs something to connect with her mother, and maybe she'd be alright\" Ron thought out loud. \"I don't know, but here's to hoping the next semester is beneficial to us\" Dani sighed, raising her soda pop can. \"Cheers\" Ron said, clinking his can with hers before getting up and leaving Dani to sleep. \"In England, it rains 200 days out of the year\" Poppy moaned, looking up facts about the boarding school that her dad was sending them to, as well as the surrounding area while her 'best friend', Ruby, browsed through Poppy's things. \"You will definitely get SAD\" Ruby told her. \"She is sad\" Molly said, setting out Poppy's shoes for her. \"Seasonal affected disorder\" Ruby scoffed at Molly, making Dani frown, but she said nothing. \"Depression due to lack of sunlight, resulting in acne and weight gain\" \"What?\" Poppy cried in panic. \"What? I saw it on Dr. 90210 \" Ruby replied defensively. \"Are you all packed, Dani?\" Molly asked her. Dani nodded. \"It's all ready to go\" Dani told her before turning her attention back to the miserable Poppy. Ruby gasped when something caught her eye. \"Not those shoes. They don't do rain\" she cried, holding up a pair of Poppy's heels, causing both Molly and Dani to roll their eyes. \"Just take them\" Poopy said kindly, knowing Ruby's real meaning and reasoning. \"hey, you promise we'll talk every day?\" Poppy asked the happy Ruby. \"Swear on your life\" yeah right. Ruby's not that considerate. \"Dude, who loves ya? Everything's going to suck without you\" Ruby said instead of answering, not even looking at Poppy. \"Aww\" Poopy sighed as if that was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to her. \"Ruby, you're my best friend! I'm gonna miss you so much\" causing Molly to huff as Poppy hugged the taller brunette. What she didn't see was Ruby's smile drop to a look of disgust as they hugged. Dani and Molly did, though. \"I know, let's check out their website\" Poopy cried, turning back to her computer. Molly left, slamming the door while Ruby and Poppy sat at the computer. Dani stood back, already knowing about Abbey Mount. She had looked it up earlier. \"Oh, my God\" they said simultaneously. \"'Abbey Mount School is an independent boarding school for girls ages 11 to 17'\" Poppy read. \"'Founded in 1797, the school is one of England's top institutions for young ladies.' It's all brick! Please tell me that's not in the countryside!\" Poopy begged in horror. Dani sighed, not even bothering to try to tell Poppy that isn't wasn't all that bad. She just wouldn't get it. It was pouring rain as the car drove through the wet England countryside. The rain cleared up by the time they reached the school, though. Poppy looked at the grounds in disgust while Gerry couldn't help but smiling, noting the almost euphoric look on Dani's face. Mr. Moore, the driver, and Dani all climbed out of the car, while Poppy stayed seated. \"Mr. Moore\" both the man and the red-head turned to see a woman, who must be the headmistress, standing next to the car. \"I'm Mrs. Kingsley\" they shook hands. \"Please, call me Gerry. This is Daniella Brown, one of your new charges\" Dani smiled at the kind-looking woman and shook her hand as well. \"Please to meet you, Ma'am. Please, call me Dani\" \"Not American\" Mrs. Kingsley looked slightly surprised by Dani's clear British accent. \"Born and raised in London until I was eight, Ma'am\" Dani explained briefly. Mrs. Kingsley nodded. \"Thank you. I am so grateful that you're taking in Poppy\" Mr. Moor told Mrs. Kingsley. \"I'm happy we could help out\" \"She's going through a rather difficult stage\" Mr. Moore tried to explain gently, not really knowing how to explain his daughter's situation. \"Just leave it to me, Mr. Moore. I have a double first in difficult\" Mrs. Kingsley smiled, winking at the prim looking girl standing beside the man. Dani beamed. Mrs. Kingsley approached the door at Poppy's side of the car. Dani didn't watch their interaction as Mr. Moore turned to her. \"Now, I know that the only reason you came is because of Poppy, but since this isn't a punishment for you, please try to enjoy yourself. I know you're excited to be back\" he pleaded. Dani shook her head, not able to feel anything other than happy now that she was back. \"Don't worry about me, Mr. Moore\" she noticed he didn't flinch whenever she called him that, anymore. \"Alright, just have fun. Okay?\" Dani nodded. \"Okay\" \"Dani!\" Mrs. Kingsley called the girl over. Dani stood beside Poppy, whom she noticed was getting a lot of attention. \"Poopy, Dani, this is Kate. She'll be your big sister at Abbey Mount\" she introduced. Kate was a tall, slender, blond girl with a kind smile, about the same age as Poppy and Dani themselves. \"You'll soon settle in\" with that, Mrs. Kingsley left them alone. \"Hi, how do you do\" Kate greeted. \"I already have a sister\" Poppy snapped before Dani could say anything. Dani felt slightly hurt at the remark. \"It's just school lingo\" Kate assured her, not fazed in the slightest…yet. \"I'll be your friend, a helping hand, that's all\" Kate explained. \"Okay, but Dani's my helping hand and I choose my friends, and FYI, you don't make the cut\" Poppy sniped. \"I'm sure that comment would sting a lot more if I knew what FYI meant\" Kate said slowly, \"But, for the moment, let's just pretend it's had the desired effect, shall we?\" with that, Kate walked away, feeling slightly bad about not even looking at the other girl. Poppy turned on Dani. \"Can you believe her nerve? Urge!\" Dani flinched at Poppy's tone. \"Saddle up, girls. We've got ourselves a bronco\" Kate told her roommates. They all looked over to see Poppy shouting at the other girl, and watched with sympathy as the girl flinched, as if expecting to get slapped. \"Poor girl\" Drippy sighed sadly. \"Poor!\" Josie cried. \"I meant the red-head that's being shouted at\" Drippy explained.[Chapter 2] A/N – Second chapter. I have this story pretty much complete on my hard drive, but I was wondering...Do you want me to go beyond the end of the movie? I woulnd't do it for more than a chapter or two, but maybe a scene of Freddie going off to college or something. Poppy calmed down after shouting. \"I'm sorry, Dani\" she sighed. Dani simply nodded, knowing that was all she was going to get. It was all she needed. Suddenly, there was a big-boned blond with two cronies in front of the pair. She said something to them in Latin smugly before said, in English, \"Harriet. Head girl\" it was then Dani noticed the dead pheseants she had slung over her shoulder. She held her hand out to be shook but neither girl moved to take it. Poppy because she was no impressed, Dani because Poppy always went first. In theory. When it suited Dani, anyway. She didn't really want to shake Harriet's hand. \"You shake the hand of the Head Girl\" Harriet said, taking Poppy's hand, \"out of respect\" with that she yanked Poppy forward roughly. \"When the Head Girl had earned my respect, then\" Poppy pulled her hand away, \"I'll shake her hand, biatch. And don't even try that dirty trick with Dani\" Poppy, despite how she treated Dani, was very protective of her. It would work better if Poppy wasn't so naive. \"I'm sorry?\" Harried asked, horrified. \"Apology accepted\" Poppy replied with no hesitation, as if Harriet's apology was expected. Harriet whirled around angrily, whacking Poppy with pheasants. Poppy glared, pulling her sunglasses of, as the three walked away. \"I'll call you too tomorrow morning, as soon as I'm back in LA\" Mr. Moore told the girls. \"No mobiles except on weekends\" Dani reminded him, though Poppy ignored her. \"I hope your flight gets seriously delayed\" Poppy said, as if that was the worst thing you can think of. Mr. Moore laughed. \"And I hope your bags end up in Kazakhstan\" she added. He stepped forward and Kissed Poppy on the head. \"I'll come back for you at the end of the semester, all right?\" he promised. She looked at him. \"Sweetheart, you know I love you\" he turned to Dani, kissing her on the head as well. \"You're my daughter too, no matter how much you think of yourself as an assistant. And if you change your mind at the end of the semester and want to stay, I don't mind\" he said, knowing she wanted to be here more than anything. Mr. Moore got back into the car and waved as the car drove off. Poppy stood there for a moment before walking away. Dani looked at the luggage before glancing at Poppy's shrinking figure and sighed as she heard the rumbling of thunder. Dani squared her shoulder and grabbed onto Poppy's trunk, leaving hers to the merciless rain as she tried to get the bright pink box under cover. Poppy walked into see four other girls and complete chaos. \"Excuse me!\" she shouted over the notice. \"Hi, I've been assigned this room\" they all stared at her. \"You need to leave\" she said, not nearly as polite as before. They all laughed. \"Oh. Wow, communal\" Poppy sighed. She hated germs, and sharing a room meant lots of germs. \"Well, it's bed number five or six, or the corridor. Your choice, mate\" one of the brunettes told her, pointing at the two empty beds. \"Move your stinking socks, Drippy\" Kate ordered the only other blond girl, besides Poppy. She complied as Poppy sat down, squirting hand sanitizer onto the nightstand. Poppy noticed Kate putting lots of chocolate into her nightstand. \"You lock away your chocolate?\" she asked in disbelief. Kate just smiled. \"Key information: if it's the Wagon Wheel versus the Rolex, the Wagon Wheel is going to trounce it every time\" Drippy told Poppy. \"What's a Wagon Wheel?\" Poppy asked despite herself. \"Jesu Christi, you have not lived!\" Drippy cried, bringing a partially opened piece of chocolate to Poppy and handing it to her. Poppy grabbed it and looked at the wrapper curiously, before holding it back in disgust. \"Ew. That's carbs and sugar\" she announced. \"What a revelation. I had no idea\" Drippy replied sarcastically. Poppy pulled out her phone and tried to get a signal. Dani wasn't up yet and she needed to call Ruby ASAP. \"What the bleep is that?\" the same brunette that had given her the ultimatum asked. \"None of your bleeping business\" Poppy mocked. \"It's an iPhone\" the other brunette girl explained, her accent sounding slightly Scottish or something. \"Good luck getting a signal. \"We only have two hotspots that work around here\" she told Poppy. \"Maybe you should try entering the 21st century, Buck Rodgers\" Poppy snarked, gesturing toward the ancient-looking phones the girls had lying around. \"This place is medieval. It's imperative that I make my phone calls\" she paced. \"It's pointless anyway\" Kate told her. \"We're only allowed mobiles on weekends\" Poppy looked at her in shock. \"How am I supposed to call my therapist?\" she asked, completely serious, despite the laughter coming from the other girls. \"She's joking, right?\" Drippy asked. \"Oh, sweetheart, this is not Beverly Hills, 90210 \" the first brunette snapped. \"Just put it away before Matron catches you\" Kate told her. \"Where's your trunk?\" she asked, noticing Poppy's lack of luggage. \"Here it is, Miss Poppy!\" Dani called from the doorway. \"Can I have some help, please?\" she asked. The four girls rushed over to help the red-head, one opening the door wide, the other three grabbing onto the pink truck to help her carry it in. \"Did you two share a trunk?\" Drippy asked. \"As if\" Poppy snorted, watching from beside her bed. \"Then where are your things?\" Kate asked Dani. \"Still outside. I think I brought them in far enough that they're not soaked, but I don't know for sure. I had to bring Miss \"oppy's trunk first\" the four girls noticed how the red-head always called Poppy 'Miss Poppy' and how she did everything Poppy said, like a maid. In sympathy and compassion, the four girls raced down with Dani to fetch her trunk as well. It was only slightly damp, thankfully, and none of her few possessions were wet, as she had bought a practical trunk. Kate helped Dani go through her things, making sure nothing was damaged while the other girls gathered around. \"Who are they?\" Josie asked, picking up the two small pictured that Dani had in a small framed shaped like a book so she could open and close it. Dani looked up and smiled tearfully. \"That's me and my best friend, Ron, from back in Malibu\" she said, pointing to one picture. \"And that one is my mom and dad, just before I was born\" she said, pointing to the other. From the break in Dani's voice, they guessed that something had happened to Dani's parents. Why else would she have arrived with Poppy Moore? Then, the door to their room opened, revealing a severe looking woman in a crisp uniform. \"Welcome back, girls\" she greeted in a slightly high-pitched voice that you would expect in a younger girl. \"Oh, good, staff\" Poppy exclaimed at the sight of the woman. \"Is she…?\" \"American\" Josie nodded. \"Oh, yes, we had one of those in 1997. Not good\" Matron said. \"My apologies for Miss Poppy, Ma'am\" Dani said, standing from the floor. The Matron took one look at the girl's tear-stained face and looked at her damp truck. \"Nothing wet?\" she asked. \"No Ma'am, it's all dry, thankfully\" Dani said politely. \"Good\" Matron turned to the other girls. \"Accustom them to my rules, and they should be in the correct uniform for a start\" she scolded, pointing at Poppy and Dani. \"Mobile phones please, girls\" each girl handed her their ancient-looking phones. \"I don't have a mobile\" Dani told Matron when she looked at her. The other's looked at her in shock, but she simply shrugged. \"Whoa! Hands off, mama. I said hands off!\" Poppy yelled as the Matron grabbed her phones. Poppy started asking the Matron is she spoke other languages, as if she didn't understand English. Dani looked like she was about to cry. Drippy gave her a sympathetic smile and help out some chocolate while the Matron was distracted. Dani smiled in thanks and grabbed the chocolate, hiding it so she could enjoy it later. 'Thank you' she mouthed. Drippy just smiled. \"I am Scottish, not remedial\" Matron snapped. Dani closed off her ears as Poppy tried to bride the Matron. She really didn't want Poppy to ruin everything for her here, but felt like her chances of enjoying herself this semester, was zero. \"Three Sunday's detention. For everyone\" the other girls groaned, including Dani. \"Thanks a lot for that, you utter moron\" Josie snapped. \"What are you, mental?\" Drippy asked. \"What? She was a grade one a-hole with a severe attitudinal problem\" Poppy proclaimed. \"The bell's going to go in a minute. Just put your uniform on\" Kate asked. \"Would one of you mind helping me?' Dani asked softly. Drippy skipped over and helped Dani get used to the layers, and cried out when she saw Dani's shoes. \"Look at these!\" they all turned to see Drippy holding up Dani's severely tall, black stiletto heels. Dani shrugged with a bashful smile. \"They're my weakness\" she said as an explanation. Once changed and in her favorite heels, Dani was the tallest girl in the dorm, but still wasn't freakishly tall. \"You will never get away with that uniform, for start\" Kate said as they walked down the corridor to the Dining Hall \"and FYI, no drinking, no smoking, no alcohol. No fireworks, no dangerous weapons, no illegal drugs. If you have a problem with someone, no random bitching. Structure your point. No Web surfing, no bullying. So, if you behave like an arsehole, we all suffer, so do not get us in your shit or we will break you\" \"Ooh, I'm scared\" Poppy cried sarcastically. \"Hi Kate\" a lot of the younger girls called out as the group passed. Kate noted that Dani was silent, and was always behind Poppy. She shared a glance with the other girls, who had also noticed. They'd have to change that. \"What are you, like, prom queen or something?\" Poppy snipped, trying to hide her jealousy. She didn't like the fact that Kate was ore liked. \"Kate's got a terrible affliction\" Jodie said. \"You're actually lucky that you don't have it. It's called popularity\" \"Hey, get up. Wait for Mrs. Kingsley and the prefects\" Kate said as Poppy sat down while they all stood. \"Screw them\" Poopy snapped. Josie and Kate both grabbed an arm and pulled Poppy up. Dani help back a laughed, but couldn't stop her smile. \"That is physical abuse! I'm calling my lawyer\" Poppy cried. \"With what?\" Kate snapped. You could tell Poppy wasn't used to other girls being wittier than her, and not being the Queen Bee. \"Well, hello, Freddie\" Drippy said slowly. \"How kind of you to grace us with your gorgeous presence\" Dani looked to see a confident blond guy, about the same age, if not a little older than herself, walking into the Dining Hall. He was truly gorgeous. Unexpectedly, his eyes met Dani's. He grinned at her, noting her tight bun, thick-framed glasses, and prim posture. But he also noticed the dangerously tall and skinny heels. He was curious, something he had not been towards one of his mother's girls in a long time. Dani, on the other hand, wanted nothing to do with the gorgeous boy. Going after someone like him meant nothing but trouble. Or so she kept telling herself. So, despite his looks and grin, Dani looked pointedly away. Though she could not hide her blush. \"And cue Harriet in three, two, one…\" Kate counted off, looking at her watch, as the other girls watched Harriet approach Freddie. Just as Kate said one, Harriet grabbed Freddie's arm. \"Subject's moved in on target\" Josie said. \"And we have contact\" Kiki added. Mrs. Kingsley ran her silver bell, and they all sat down to eat. \"I love that Freddie's always here at the beginning of term\" Drippy gushed. \"Such a perfect welcome back\" \"I want nothing to do with him. A guy like that just spells trouble, and Poppy gives me enough of that. I don't need to worry about Harriet or someone else trying to trip me down the stairs while I'm chasing after this wild child\" Dani huffed. \"Hey!\" Poppy said in protest, but knew Dani's words were true. She felt kinda bad about it, but as long as Dani was a door mat, she was going to take advantage of it. \"So, who is Freddie?\" Poppy asked. \"Mrs. Kingsley's son. Devastating heartthrob\" Drippy explained. \"Won't look at any of us since he got caught playing doctors and nurses with a girl in the third grade when he was 11\" Dani snorted. \"Really?\" she giggled slightly. \"Massive hoo-hah\" Drippy giggled. \"They're not together now, thought\" she finished. \"Because of her massive hoo-hah?\" Poppy asked loudly and naively. It was funny, thought Dani. In a way, both sides were naive. Poppy was naïve because she thought the world revolved around her and the lifestyle she was raised in, and everyone one else was stupid. The other girls were naïve because they walked the straight and narrow – for the most part – and didn't know how to really let go and have fun. They all laughed at Poppy's comment. \"No. Fraternizing is forbidden\" Drippy explained. \"No problem there\" Dani laughed. They didn't realize Freddie had been listening the entire time. And he took Dani's comments as a challenge. \"Here you go\" the plates for their table were handed down. \"I can't eat this\" Poppy said when she looked at the food on the plate. \"Anorexia or bulimia?\" Drippy asked. Dani huffed slightly at the assumption that Poppy had an eating disorder. \"Because if it's bulimia we'd rather you didn't eat other people's birthday cake on their birthdays. It's such a waste\" \"Actually, Miss Poppy is a pescetarian Monday through Wednesday, fruitarian Thursday through Sunday, and always a vegetarian\" Dani explained. Mrs. Kingsley rang her bell again and everyone folded their hands together to pray. Poppy stared speaking Hindu. At Poppy's announcement explaining that, Dani groaned, her head slamming onto the table. Poppy and Dani were walking in front of their 'pack' – their dorm mates – and Harriet was leader her group. The two met in the corridor. Poppy and Harriet were head to chest – Harriet was huge, despite Poppy's heels – until Kate grabbed Poppy and dragged hr out of Harriet' way, hissing \"get out of the way\" \"Hey, watch the shmere, girlfriend\" Poppy said loudly, causing Harriet to stop and look at Poppy in disgust. \"Two hundred goats died for this\" \"we meet again. How sublime\" Harriet said, her smile completely fake. \"Learn the rules. When it comes to right of way, there is a hierarchy. Teachers, prefects, scholars, dogs, vermin, Americans. Kate? See to it she falls in line\" Harriet ordered. Then, she looked at Dani. \"You're not American. You don't need to be dragged down with her \" Harriet sneered when mentioning Poppy. In a fit of course, Dani stood up to Harriet. \"Miss Poppy may not be the kindest or most considerate, but compared to you she is a Goddess. I would rather have her wipe her dirty boots with my hair than walk behind you any day\" Dani hissed. \"What is this place? Hogwarts?\" Poppy hissed as Harriet walked away.[Chapter 3] A/N – I couldn't wait to update again. I'm kinda sad I have no reviews, but that's okay. It's not like I wrote this to get reviews. I edited the first two chapters, but it's not nessesary to reread them, it was only some little things. Just FYI. haha. For anyone that speaks French, I'm so sorry if I got the translation wrong. I used Google Translate. \"Bedtime girls\" Matron said, walking through the room. \"Night\" the other girls cried as they tucked themselves into bed. \"Good night Matron\" Dani called, setting her glasses onto her nightstand, on top of the door she had been reading. Matron handed a stack of clothes to Poppy. \"The correct school uniform. Wear it. Bed\" Matron ordered. Dani internally groaned, knowing this was going to be another battle. Or not. \"Poppy Moore, bed, now!\" Matron cried as she walked away, knowing Poppy wouldn't listen. Surprisingly, Poppy complied. \"Bonjour\" the man greeted walking down the aisle of his French class. \"Sir, I think there was a mistake. I do not belong in this class\" Dani said to the man as he passed her. \"Nonsense, every girl needs to know French\" he dismissed her protest. \"Sir\" she tried again, but he waved her off. Because Dani really didn't want to waste an hour or more a day learning what she already know, she stood and proclaimed \"Monsieur, je suis à l'aise en français. Je connais la langue depuis que j'étais jeune, c'était ma deuxième langue. Je peux tenir une conversation et de parler si vite et de façon cohérente que la plupart des orateurs anglais ne me comprenez, Monsieur.\" Sir, I am fluent in French. I have known the language since I was young, it was my second language. I can hold a conversation and speak so quickly and coherently that most English speakers would not understand me, Sir. Mr. Nellist looked at her in surprise. \"All right then. I'll talk to the headmistress tonight and we'll see what to do, for now, I hope you don't mind going through today's classwork anyway\" he said, stammering slightly. \"Yes, Sir\" Dani sat back down. \"All right. Translations today, everyone. So, PDF, pretty damn straightforward. Ergo... which means? Anyone? Ergo?\" Dani didn't want to draw attention to herself again, so she chose to let someone else take the spotlight. \"Oh, Mr. Nellist\" Drippy called, raising her hand. \"Yes, Drippy\" Dani snorted. She couldn't believe the teachers actually called her Drippy. \"'Er, leave'?\" she guessed, making everyone laugh. \"Luddite. No, it means therefore, Drippy. Therefore, you'll probably finish early, which means that you'll have lots of time to ask me questions about my trip to Champagne with my girlfriend. Now, sadly, my ex-girlfriend, though she was my girlfriend at the time\" he added as we giggled. Mr. Nellist seemed to realize he was rambling. \"Put your headphones on, please\" Dani sat on her bed reading while Kate was dying Drippy's eyebrows and Josie and Kiki were sitting on Josie's bed. Poppy was using her LED light pads to tan herself, or something. \"Apparently, California girls wax their bums\" \"What?\" Kate asked. \"Why?\" \"To look Brazilian. Makes it more attractive\" Drippy said. \"Not all of them. In fact, it's only the girls that plan on wearing really skimpy clothes so guys can see their…never mind, you're right, majority does\" Dani said quietly, setting down her book and moving to sit at Drippy's feet, the chocolate she had given her the day before in her hand. \"Do you think she's done it?\" Kate asked, looking at Poppy. \"Hundred percent\" Drippy said, looking up. \"She hasn't\" they all looked at Dani. \"Neither of us has. That's why her so-called boyfriend is a cheating scum ball. She won't sleep with him\" Dani said. \"is there a problem?\" Poppy snapped, turning off the lights and pulled out an ear bud. \"How many boys have you shagged?\" Drippy asked point-blank, wanting to be sure. \"Well\" Poppy said cockily. \"There was Brandon, eight pack. Chase, jock. Tyler, bajillionare. Derek. He was Kelly Slater's cousin. And, oh, Jack. He was all-around sick\" Dani shook her head, disapointed. Drippy grabbed the mirror and cried \"Shit! Kate!\" at the sight of her dark eyebrows. \"Sorry, Drip. It looked lighter on the box\" Dippy groaned and stalked over to her bed with the mirror. \"That is butters. Better not stop me pulling at the social\" Drippy muttered. \"Honey, eyebrows are the least of your worries\" Poppy said. Matron opened the door. \"Lights out girls. Everyone into bed\" \"Good night Matron\" we call said, turning off our lights. Poppy opened her laptop, the light shining throughout the room. \"Hey, switch that off!\" Kate hissed. \"No wireless. Should have known\" Poppy cried loudly. \"Internet is only allowed in the computer room\" Kiki reminded Poppy. Poppy stood and started walking towards the door. \"Whoa. We are not allowed out of bed after lights out!\" Kiki cried. Poppy switched on their lights. \"Oh look, they're not out\" \"Poppy!\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Come back!\" \"Get back into bed!\" Poppy ignored them all and headed for the computer room. Dani groaned and flopped back in her bed. \"I'm sorry\" she called to the other girls. \"Why? It's not your fault\" Josie said. Dani froze for a moment. \"It's been a long time since something Poppy's done hasn't been my fault\" she said quietly. The other girls felt bad for her. \"I don't think I can handle being her slave, not here. This is home. In Malibu, I had no one, and everything was so strange. But here, this is my home, this is where I really belong. And I don't think I can play the complacent door mat here\" she ranted. \"Then don't\" Kate said simply. Dani sat up and looked at her. \"Don't let Poppy boss you around, and don't let the things she does effect you. Be free and have fun. Enjoy being home\" she continued. Dani swallowed hard. \"Will…will you guys help me? I think I'll need help adjusting\" she asked hesitatntly. The four girls shared glances. \"Of course. You're one of us\" Kiki voiced the popular opinion. Dani smiled. \"Thank you\" With that, they all fell asleep, praying to God Poppy didn't get caught and get them all into trouble. Suddenly, the fire alarm started ringing. Matron woke everyone up, room by room, and shuffled everyone out. Dani went out with everyone else, but Poppy couldn't. Matron was in front of her. If she followed, she would surely be caught out of bed. At least, she had thought Dani had been with the other girls. \"Come on\" Poppy turned to see Dani pulled her away from Matron. \"Just because I hate that you use me and get me into trouble, doesn't mean I'll let you get caught by the Matron\" she hissed, pulling Poppy along. Dani led Poppy outside, onto the roof. There was a ladder outside. \"Come on\" this time, Poppy pulled Dani into a room. Dani hug back by the window, knowing this was a bad idea, but Poppy tried to run through. \"Hey, who's there\" both girls froze. There was the sound of water…crap! They just caught some guy in the middle of his shower! Dani debated her chances of getting out of the room without getting caught while Poppy told the random dude her name. Then Dani realized. The voice was too young to be one of the teachers, so it must be…Freddie! Dani's expression morphed to one of horror at the realization. Poppy grabbed Dani's hand and dragged her out the door as she got directions from Freddie. Dani tried very hard not to listen, singing in her head to drown the conversation out. They didn't see Freddie peeking out of his shower curtain, just in time to see the blond running out of the room, the red-head behind her. All he saw of the second girl was bright, flaming red hair, pale skin, and a mid-thigh length black nightgown. Poor girl was barefoot. Poppy and Dani were standing beside the coach, observing the class, just for today. The other girls were running, rather poorly, with lacrosse sticks. Dani smiled as Poppy freaked out over some mud splashing onto her face. \"Crack on, team. Lovely stick work, Harriet\" the girls all gathered around, sitting down, panting. \"Well, super, super effort. We may not win the championship, but we'll win a lot of friends, yeah?\" Even Dani had to agree with Poppy, that was a rubbish attitude. \"So bloody English\" Poppy scoffed. Harriet laughed. \"Really? And you could do better?\" Dani didn't want to try, Lacrosse wasn't her thing. Well, not anymore. \"Laugh it up, I could whip all of your asses blindfolded\" Poppy bragged. Miss Rees-Withers looked nervous by the comment, but didn't say anything. Dani hated to admit it, but she was a rather weak-minded teacher. \"This, I'd love to see\" Harriet said. Poppy picked up her lacrosse stick. \"Oh, it's on like Donkey Kong . Do your worst, horse face\" Instead of going for the ball, both girls started hitting each other. \"Foul! Body check!\" Miss Rees-Withers blew her whistle, but the girls ignored her. Just as Dani heard a car horn honk she stood up, walked forward, and grabbed both girl by the collars, not even flinching as she got beat with the lacrosse sticks. \"Will you two stop fighting like children and start acting your age!\" Dani snarled, tossing them away from each other as the horn honked again. All attention turned towards the convertible car. Driving it, just happened to be Freddie. He thought it was funny, watching the small girl man-handle the fighting females as if they were no more than squabbling toddles and break up the fight, even though both girls were bigger, Harriet very much so. He noticed her thick glasses were perfectly straight, but a few locks of bright red hair had fallen out of the tight bun and into her face. Bright red, flaming hair… \"Shouldn't you guys be in bikinis for that?\" he asked the girls. \"Mud wrestling in bikinis is so over rated. Apparently, smacking each other with stick while completely ignoring the ball is in fashion\" Dani teased, panting slightly while still standing perfectly straight. Her strict posture made the heaving of her chest all the more defined. \"Hello, Fredster. Dig the car\" Harriet flirted. Freddie laughed at her before turning his attention to the other blond. \"Hello Moore, Poppy Moore. Who's your friend?\" \"Daniella Brown\" Dani cried, bowing dramatically, \"But call me that and I'll have to run you over with your own car, and those are very pretty wheels. Call me Dani\" If anyone asked why she was flirting with him, even while knowing it would cause nothing but trouble, Dani wouldn't have an answer. It was simply too tempting to tease him and flirt with him. It was…fun. As Freddie sped away, Poppy turned to Harriet. \"Ooh, do you love Fredster? Do you want to kiss Fredster on the lips?\" \"Don't be so immature\" Harriet snapped. \"Don't try and hide it, honey. We've got ourselves a SULA. Sweaty Upper Lip Alert\" the girls giggled as Harriet huffed and stormed away. Poppy turned on Dani. \"I thought you said he was nothing but trouble? And how the heck to you catch his eye?\" Poppy asked. Dani shrugged. \"On the second, no clue. On the first…\" Dani grinned. \"It was too good an opportunity too miss. Besides, I've decided I was going to enjoy my time here. Might as well have some fun\" Poppy was called to talk to the headmistress. Dani hung back with the other girls while Poppy skipped class. \"Why do you wear your hair like that, Dani?\" Josie asked, lightly touching Dani's tight bun. Dani looked at her. \"This. Oh, it used to be because, with all the work I had to do, my hair got in my face all the time. As my hair got longer, the bun got tighter. It's just…easier that way\" Dani explained. \"It looked gorgeous down\" Kate told her. \"Yeah, Lots of girl would kill for your color\" Drippy told her. \"And what about contacts, do you have any?\" Kiki asked. Dani nodded. \"I had a set of contacts with me, but I only use them for emergencies\" The girls looked at each other; something they seem to do a lot when Dani was involved. \"The night of the formal, we are giving you a makeover\" Kate decided. Dani smiled. \"Sure, whatever you want\"[Chapter 4] A/N – As funny as the scene where Kate and Poppy make Freddie do a lot of embarrassing stuff to cover for them, I'm not that cruel. I can't do it. I'm sorry. When Drippy, Kiki, Josie, and Dani came back into the dorm, Kate explained how we were going to get Poppy expelled. Poppy made it clear that she wanted Dani to have nothing to do with it – she realized how much Dani needed Abbey Mount. So, Poppy would get expelled, and Dani would stay. But Dani refused not to be invovled. Poppy was reading the book Mrs. Kingsley had given her with the light from her lighter. Silently, all five girls approached her and turned on their torches at the exact same time, scaring Poppy. \"Watch it, Wee Willie Winkie, you'll set us all alight\" Kate teased. \"Now, I've had a word with the girls. True, some of them took a little more convincing than others\" a pointed look, and light, at Drippy, \"but it's decided. We're going to help you, and only you, get expelled. We're your very own crack unit. Operation Freedom. Kiki, please explain\" \"Right. We'll commence with an entry-level basic favorite. Just to get warmed up. But it's no good just playing the same old tricks. Try to be as imaginative as possible. Only do things that will get you noticed. Vary your targets as much as you can. And although we'll all be helping you, the important thing to remember is that you have to get the blame for everything\" Kiki explained. Harriet on the phone. \"No, I have certainly not been naughty. My disciplinary record is exemplary.\" The Pool was filled with red water and random goops of white…something that was supposed to look like whipped cream with dodge balls on top like cherries. \" A ginger haired French teacher in tight trousers and the Sports teacher were caught making out. See the pictures on the Abbey Mount website…\" \"If you make enough of a nuisance of yourself, she will eventually bow to pressure, and she'll have to call your father. And then, with any luck, she'll recommend you to the Honor Court\" Dani and Poppy ran to Matrons car. \"Quick, give me the tape!\" she laughed. Dani giggled and handed the tape to Poppy, looking to make sure they wouldn't get caught. \"Pull the button off\" Dani suggested after Poppy shoved the tape in. Poppy looked past Dani and frowned. \"Oh my God, there's a car\" \"Quick!\" both girls got out and hid underneath Matron's car. Of course, it had to be Freddie that pulled up. \"Whoa, it's all right, Cerberus. Only me\" Freddie cried. Matron must have come out. Crap! \"Who's Cerberus?\" Poppy asked quietly. \"The dog that guards the gates of Hell. Shush\" Dani explained quickly and quietly. She was glad the girls didn't talk her into letting her hair down today. It would have surly gotten them caught. Freddie just happened to drop his keys then. He knelt down to pick them up and noticed Dani and Poppy hiding under the Matron's car. His eyes lingered on Dani for a moment. Both girls made frantic 'Shh' motions, silently begging him not to turn them in. Normally, Freddie would have had to think before deciding whether or not to turn the girls in. But then he caught sight of bright green eyes, that could not be seen normally and instantly his mind was made up. \"Hurry up\" Matron hissed. \"Or you'll disturb my girls\" Freddie looked at the window, to see at least a dozen girls pressed against it, waving at him. Matron stormed away, then. Freddie followed after her, glancing back at where he knew the two girls were hidden. \"I don't get it. It's like you have immunity. Your dad's a Mafia guy or something\" Kate joked from her bath. \"Yup. I'm the Goddaughter\" Poppy joked from the tub next to her. \"Whatever it is, she's cutting you a lot of slack\" Drippy said from the third tub. \"We need to up the ante. In fact, we need to focus on her big weakness\" \"Oh, my God. You have to snog Freddie!\" Kate cried. Poppy looked at Dani, whose face had paled considerably. Despite what she says, Dani had a giant crush on Freddie, and Poppy didn't really care for him. She couldn't do that to Dani. But, before she said no, she needed to know what snog meant. Just to be sure. \"Snog? That sounds disgusting. What is that?\" Poppy laughed. \"It's English for make out\" Kiki explained. \"Mrs. Kingsley will go ballistic\" Kate added. Poppy looked at Dani again, who was sitting across from the four baths with Josie. \"I can't\" she sighed. \"Why?\" all four voices cried at once. Poppy looked at them. \"I just can't, okay? Besides, Freddie isn't my type?\" she added, thinking of someone back home. \"Tall, Blond, and gorgeous isn't your type?\" Drippy asked in disbelief. \"Well tall, definitely. But he had shaggy red hair, and isn't really what most girls would call gorgeous…\" Poppy trailed off. \"Oh, my God. Ron? You like Ron!\" Dani cried, staring at Poppy as if she had grown a second head. Poppy nodded sheepishly. \"And you couldn't have figured that out before we were sent to England!\" she ranted, making them all laughed. It was silent for a moment as they all settled down again before Dani said, \"I'll do it\" \"What?\" \"I'll snog Freddie. Poppy and I are always considered a package deal. I was never going to be allowed to stay if Poppy was expelled. If I get caught snogging Freddie, it'll add to everything Poppy's done, and we'll recommended to the Honor Court\" Dani explained. \"Dani\" Poppy sighed. Dani like Freddie too much to use him like that. Knowing what Poppy meant, Dani shook her head. \"It's not like I'll ever see him again after this\" Dani sighed. \"Alright, so what's the deal with the social?\" Poppy asked, trying to change the subject. \"It's the school dance on Saturday night\" Josie explained. \"Traditionally, it's fancy dress. This year, it's Movie Magic\" Kiki explained. \"But the only ones who bother to dress up are the teachers, morons, and Harriet\" Drippy said, making them all laughed. \"I say, we dress up fancy. Real fancy\" Poppy proposed. \"This mission needs to be planned precisely\" Kate added. \"Kiki?\" \"Okay. Operation Freedom, part two, step one. Attract Freddie. Step one, subsection A, look the part\" Kiki explained. \"Does this mean you guys get to have your make-over?\" Dani asked. \"Yes!\" was the unanimous agreement. \"Kiki, you're actually making something quite exciting sound like physics homework\" Josie teased. \"Basically, we're going into town, and we're gonna get some killer outfits\" Josie explained simply. \"I want something that says, 'Elegant, but at the same time incredibly slutty and available'\" Drippy said. They all laughed. \"In fact, I'm not that bothered about elegant\" Drippy decided, making them all laughed louder. \"Everyone sign out. Remember you are representatives of the school\" Matron lectured. \"Poppy Moore, what are you wearing? You are going into town, not appearing in a window in Amsterdam\" Matron cried when she saw Poppy. \"Change immediately\" \"I don't have anything else\" Poppy explained, though it was only slightly true. Her other clothes weren't much better. \"I thought you might be concerned by that attire, Matron\" Harriet said from behind Matron. \"So we had a little look-see in lost property on our way here. Didn't we?\" \"We did\" Jane and Charlotte, Harriet's cronies, chimed together. It was kind of creepy. Harriet snapped and the poor younger-year that served her stepped out, handing Harriet the yellow jumper. \"It'll suit you\" Harriet claimed, showing off the dog picture on the front. \"Promise\" Poppy looked at Dani. \"You are so lucky you don't dress like me\" she said, glancing at Dani's boot-cut jeans, black V-neck sweater, and – as usual – her ridiculously high heeled black stilettos. \"Well, that's cute. My grandma used to have a dog just like that\" Drippy said, trying to make it getter as Harriet and her friends barked at Poppy. \"Poppy, I think your jumper is the cat's pajamas\" Kiki said. They giggled at that. Finally, the bus came. Poppy, of course, almost missed the bus because of her germ-phobia, but they all pulled her in with minor panic. Then, they looked back to see the Matron's car. \"Oh, my God! Look!\" Poppy cried, pointing out the window. Matron passed by, furiously trying to turn off the tape of heavy metal music Poppy and Dani had put it. They were all laughing at Matron passed the bus. Later, as the bus was driving off, the girls caught sight of a woman walking two adorable dogs. All of them, but Poppy, knelt down to pet the puppies. \"Hi!\" \"Ew, gross!\" Poppy cried, stepping away. The other girls followed her. \"Where are we going?' Poppy asked. \"To our favorite shop\" Josie cried. \"Cancer research?\" Poppy asked sarcastically, looking st the store's sign. \"Girls, I'm all about finding a cure, but considering I flunked chemistry, I don't know how much help I'm going to be. And BTW, which, FYI, means 'By the way', this is supposed to be shopping time\" \"We're not going to be doing research\" Kate snapped. \"This is a charity shop. The money goes to charity.\" Kate explained. \"Oh, I just had a heart palpitation. You guys are so adorable, but we need to look really hot for the social\" Poppy said as if they were idiots. \"So, let's go hit Oxford Street\" The other girls just walked past her. \"I take it you flunked geography, too\" Josie said. \"Oxford Street is in London, my friend. This is your lot\" and they all walked in. \"Oh, my gosh, this stuff is so cool!\" Dani cried, looking around. \"Poppy can not understand my obsession with old things, but this! This is heaven\" Dani cried, hugging a rack of clothes, making the others laugh. \"Girls, this is a serious mission. Get a move on. Now Poppy, how about something like this on Dani? Fifty pence.\" Josie said, holding up an old-fashion dress for Poppy to see. \"It looks like someone dies in it\" Poppy said rudely. \"I'd rather stay the Yorkshire Terrier freak\" \"You're a Buddhist, right? Think of it as clothing reincarnation?\" Kate suggested. \"Honey, even Buddha wouldn't have been caught dead in half this stuff\" Poppy scoffed. \"That, my dear, is what my needlework skills are for. Anything you can get ideas for, I'll fix it up in no time\" Dani told her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. \"I guess anything's possible. Come on. Let's do this\" Poppy sighed, dropping her bag. The girls ran through outfit after outfit, laughing and altering as they went. \"Unbelievable. This season Marni. It's sophisticated, it's elegant\" Poppy raved. \"hot to trot?\" Drippy suggested. \"Check\" They all giggled. \"If we could just call this stuff vintage and add, like, three zeros to the price tag, I could totally get into it\" Poppy said. \"Perfection. Operation Freddie is well and truly underway\" Kate cried happily. Poppy gasped. \"Malibu moment. Remember what I taught you guys?\" \"Who are we?\" and the camera flashed. \"Oh. My God. It's Tom Cruise\" the hair dresser cried when he saw Drippy. \"Would you like to say that any louder? I need your help\" Drippy cried. \"And I need a back wax and a night with Michael Buble, but we don't always get what we want. Trudy, attend to the brows\" the guy ordered. Poppy looked at Dani. Dani shook her head. \"Your transformation first, butterfly\" Poppy smiled at the endearment and sat down. \"Yorkie fan. It's a nice dog, Yorkie\" the guy, Mr. Christopher, said, looking at Poppy's jumper. \"I used to have one once. Wee Philippe. Got savaged to death by a badger\" as he said the last work we plucked a hair from Poppy's head and sniffed it. \"Aren't you the soufflé that didn't arise\" he cried. \"Tell me about it. Okay. I need these extensions taken out, a serious deep conditioning. I'm thinking side bangs with some buttery highlights, and maybe a few honey tones\" Poppy explained, sounding seriously Malibu right then. Dani and the girls giggled. \"And I'd like a night on Fireman Island, but I'm afraid I'm whistling Dixie, okay? So here's what's on offer for you. A tight perm\" Poppy's face took on a look of horror as she furiously shook her head no. \"How about this? A wee bob. That's fun, isn't it?\" \"No\" \"Okay. What about this? Oh, a pineapple. Oh, Hawaii\" \"No\" \"What about something a little more natural?\" I immediately knew what he meant and nodded. \"Do it\" Poppy looked hard at Dani, and eventually nodded. \"Natural it is\" After it all was over, Mr. Christopher revealed Poppy, who looked exactly like her mother at her age. Dani gasped. \"Oh, My God! Poppy!\" \"You look so\" Drippy trailed off. \"English\" Kate finished for her. \"I look like my mom\" Poppy said. \"Is she beautiful, too?\" Drippy asked. \"She was. Very\" Dani told them. \"Sorry\" Drippy groaned. \"Foot-in-mouth disease\" \"Wow. Thank you\" Poppy sighed, not able to tear her eyes away from her shoulder-length brown hair and side bangs that looked almost exactly like her mothers. \"You're welcome, Darling. Who's next\" Dani stood. Mr. Christopher immediately scowled. \"I can't do anything with your hair if it's all tied up like a fly in a spider's web\" Dani snorted and slowly released her hair from the tight bun. Everyone in the room gasped. Dani's hair was so long, it reached her knees because she never cut it, and it was a bright red, like a fire, but not the neon color. Her hair fell in thick barrel curled waved, and it fell around her, softening her features. \"Take off your glasses, lass\" he ordered softly. They were all mystified by the girl's sudden transformation, just from letting her hair down. Dani's glasses came off, and you could not easily see her green eyes, perfectly complimenting her hair. \"Lass, you don't need anything but a trim. Don't you dare try to do anything to that hair of your\" Mr. Christopher told her. Dani looked into his mirror and gasped. \"Is that really…\" her voice trailed off. Poppy nodded. Dani fingered the length of her hair. \"Maybe just style it\" she looked at Mr. Christopher. \"I'll come back next time and get it cut, but the social is Movie Magic. I can go as Rapunzel\" she smiled. The other girls nodded. \"Brilliant\" \"Dani, maybe you should put your hair up again. That way, at the social it's a complete surprise\" Josie suggested. Dani nodded and they helped her put it back up before walking out of the tiny salon. \"Okay. Time for the juice. Any bright ideas?\" Poppy asked. Dani shook her head. \"I'm not drinking, you know me\" Poppy nodded. \"Anyone else?\" \"Leave it to me. I've got a plan\" Drippy explained.[Chapter 5] A/N – Next chapter you find out a bit more about Dani, counting her big secret. Can you guys guess what it is? I want to say thanks to AnaleighJames for being my first, and so far only, reviewer. Dani waiting outside with Kiki and Josie while Kate, Drippy, and Poppy went inside the store to buy alcohol. Suddenly, a furious Kate and an upset Drippy came outside. \"Why did you order the Crème Eggs, you idiot?\" Kate snapped. \"Why did you only get two, Drippy?\" Josie asked. \"Now, we've got to quarter them\" \"He believed us till then\" Kate huffed. \"Oh, yeah, right\" Drippy snapped. \"Maybe if you hadn't asked me what Keith's report was about. Where's Poppy?\" Just then, Poppy came out of the store, a bag with a bottle in her hand. \"Are you okay?\" she asked Drippy nonchalantly. \"I'm furious, stupid Drippy\" Kate growled. \"I know. Never mind. Let's go\" and with that, Poppy led us back to the bus and back into our dorms, where we all got ready for the social. \" Okay Dani, let's get Freddie \" Kiki said. It was fun getting dressed up together, Dani mused as they linked arms and headed down to the social. They had done each other's hair and make-up, and Poppy and Dani had been in control of dress. No girl worked on herself. It was truly a sisters moment. As they were walking down the stairs, it was easy to tell that they had arranged themselves so Dani and Poppy were in the middle, and Dani was the center of attention. All eyes were on them as they entered. \"Wow\" the guy Freddie had been talking to stopped mid-sentence, staring at something behind him. Freddie turned and saw the six familiar girls that had been making a name for themselves. But one girl caught his eye. Her dress was longer than the others girls, hem stopped mid-calf. It was loose so she could move, and each movement made it look like she was a mystical nymph dancing in nature. The dress looked like a shorter version of those you would see princesses of fairytales wearing, with sleeves that ended just below her elbow and exposed her delicate collarbone, and a corset-styled bodice. It was a light blue, and didn't clash with her hair, which had been left down and reached just below her knees. Freddie was sure if she straightened her hair, it would reach the floor. It was pulled back into a half-ponytail with a simply, silver butterfly clip. That and the simple silver charm bracelet were the only jewelry she wore. Freddie grinned when he saw her signature stilettos. What was most shocking, thought, was that her glasses were gone. She must have been wearing contacts, but that thought didn't really matter as he noticed her clear, bright green eyes. Poppy dragged Dani over to the staring Freddie, who smiled when he saw them coming over. Poppy grinned at the furious-looking Harriet as Dani said, almost shyly, \"Hi\" to Freddie. \"Hello, trouble\" he greeted kindly. Dani blushed slightly. \"I like what you've done with your hair, Poppy\" he said politely to Dani's friend. \"And it's nice to actually see yours, Dani. Is it actually that long?\" he asked, staring at the long, curly locks. Dani nodded. \"I have never cut it, so it just kept growing. I figured, I can get it cut next trip to town. Tonight, I'm a modern Rapunzel\" \"What are you doing?\" Harriet hissed. \"This is a theme costume party, not a Dwarves Prostitutes Convention\" \"I'm sorry\" Poppy said sweetly. \"Though I must say, you look incredible. You make a great Shrek\" Freddie and Dani laughed. Then, Dani heard the song that was playing. \"Oh, this is one of my favorite songs\" she turned to Freddie. \"Please come dance with me?\" she pleaded. Freddie nodded, grinning, and allowed himself to be pulled onto the dance floor by the red-head. Poppy smirked at Harriet. \"Maybe next time\" she gloated before walking away. Poppy joined the girls as they all watched Dani dance with Freddie. They both had giant smiled on their faces, and Dani's face could not rid itself of her blush. \"I don't think she can do it\" Poppy whispered. \"What, get Freddie?\" Kiki asked. Poppy shook her head. \"No, use Freddie. She really likes him. I don't think I can make her do something like that for me\" Poppy sighed as they watched the couple. Dani was having the time of her life. Being so close to Freddie was intoxicating, and she almost couldn't breathe. Little did she know, Freddie felt the same way as he held the tiny fairy-like girl in his arms. Furious, Harriet ran to the DJ booth and stopped the music, making them all stop dancing and look at her. Harriet turned on a random hip-hop song and looked at Dani smugly. Dani just grinned. She could do this. Dani pulled Poppy into the center with her, and together they started dancing. Harriet was way out of her depth. They grew up in Malibu, California. This was their jam. All eyes were on the girls, most guys not able to take their eyes off of their swiftly moving hips. Dani, not able to stop herself from showing off, was very glad for the longer skirt as she did some more difficult tricks. Not once did she flash anyone, so she couldn't get in trouble. Dani decided to leave the floor as the other girl jumped in, but her heel caught the edge of the platform and Dani fell onto the floor. Freddie raced over and knelt over her. \"Are you okay?\" he asked her, slightly worried. Dani groaned as she sat up. \"Well that's a bit humiliating\" she sighed. \"I'm sure not many people saw you fall\" Freddie lied. Dani shook her head. \"It's not that, it's that I fell at all. I've been wearing these shoes for ten years, I've never fallen before\" she explained. \"Is she okay?\" Sarah, as the coach had insisted on being called, asked as she joined Freddie leaning over Dani. \"Shall I call an ambulance? You can be sick in my hands if you like?\" Dani giggled slightly. \"No ma'am, I'm fine. I think I just need some air\" Dani told her. Freddie picked her up before she could move and started carrying her out of the room. \"I can walk, you know\" she told him indignantly. \"Yes, but then I'd have to set you down, and you would no longer be in my arms\" he told her. \"Cheeky\" Dani rolled her eyes. Freddie sat down on one of the chairs, Dani still in his arms. His grip tightened as she tried to move. \"Come on, I must be too heavy\" she insisted, trying to get up again. \"Stop\" Dani froze as she felt Freddie's cool breath on her ear. She stopped fighting him, and just relaxed against his muscular chest, trying to resist the impulse to snuggle into the warmth his body provided. \"I go back to school tomorrow, but I'll be back on the 18th\" he told her sadly. Dani sighed. \"I have no right to miss you; I hardly know you\" she mused. Freddie turned her so she was looking in his eyes. \"Maybe, when I get back, we can get to know each other\" he proposed. Dani grinned. \"I'd like that\" Freddie leaned in, wanting to give her one kiss before he had to leave… \" Ahem \" Charlotte cleared her through. \"Crap\" Freddie cried, not hiding his dislike for the girls at all. \"Thing one and thing two\" Dani sighed, resting her forehead into the crook between Freddie's neck and shoulder. \"Fraternizing with the girls, Freddie Kingsley, as you are well aware, is not allowed\" Charlotte ranted. \"So, you're trying to get Harriet expelled by helping her try to win Freddie?' Dani asked. \"Some friends you are. At least Poppy wants to be expelled\" Freddie stared at Dani after that comment. She looked at him apologetically. \"I'll explain it on the 18th. Can you wait that long?\" she asked softly, her face mere inches from his own. \"As long as I have to\" he replied before letting her get up and leave. Dani walked in to see Kate snogging one of the boys thoroughly . \"Nice work Kate\" Poppy said, stepping beside Dani. \"So, is Operation Freddie well and truly underway?\" Kate asked. \"No\" Poppy said before Dani could speak. Dani looked at her, confused. \"I don't want to make you do that. I know you really like him\" she explained. Dani nodded. \"I'm going to explain it to him\" Both girls looked at her like she was crazy. \"What?\" they asked. \"Freddie's planning on seeing me on the 18th. I'm planning on explaining everything to him. What do you know, he might help. He did when we were pranking Matron's car\" Dani explained her reasoning. Poppy nodded slowly. \"Alright. Thought…I'm not entirely sure I want to go\" Poppy said softly, looking at the other four girls. \"Someone call Al Gore. I think the ice queen is melting\" Kate laughed. \"Do you mean it?\" Dani asked, hopefully. Poppy nodded. \"I think I do\" she smiled. \"Yay!\" Dani practically tackled Poppy in her hug. \"Now I just have to make sure Freddie and I don't get caught\" they all laughed. Just then, Drippy plopped herself onto Kate's lap. \"What and excellent night. Eight boys have actually come up and directly spoken to me\" she gushed. \" Now for all you lovers out there \" Mr. Nellist, the DJ for tonight, said into the microphone, \" it's your final chance. It's the last dance \" the girls all looked at each other and squealed. Instead of dancing with boys, they all danced together. \"Come on, girls. If we lose today we're out of the championships again\" Sarah cried. Drippy, Kate, and Poppy were all still sitting, moaning. \"I told you guys not to\" Dani said softly, rubbing Drippy's back, because Drippy was the one that would have it worse off than any of them. Mrs. Kingsley walked in, not looking at all surprised. They all stood when they noticed her standing there. \"Perhaps you'd like to explain last night to me. Kate?\" Kate looked at the others before sighing. \"I'm sorry. We just got a little bit carried away\" \"Well, as I understand it, Drippy got totally carried away by Mr. Nellist and Miss Rees-Withers after she lay in a pool of her own vomit\" Drippy and Dani both flinched. She had spent last night nursing the girl, trying to help as best she could. \"Actually, it was Kate's vomit, Mrs. Kingsley\" Drippy said, as if that made it any better. \"I was just lying in it\" Mrs. Kingsley looked horrified. \"I expected better of you two. At least Dani was and still is sober! You know the values we stand for at Abbey Mount. And as for you, Poppy, I don't know whether to be please that you've finally made some friends here, or furious that you've led them astray\" \"Furious\" they all turned to look at Dani. \"You should be furious, ma'am, but not at Poppy. I was sober, I was completely coherent and clear-thinking. They were my responsibility, and I let you, and them, down\" Dani tried to take the blame onto herself. \"That's not true\" Kate quickly told Mrs. Kingsley. \"This had nothing to do with Dani, she just doesn't want us to get in trouble\" Drippy added. \"I know, girls. Daniella will not be blamed. Dismissed\" they all grabbed their things and headed out. \"Not you, Miss Moore\" Mrs. Kingsley said without looking up from her clipboard. She turned and stared at Poppy. \"I gave your father my word I would try and help you, but I'll be honest, you're making it awfully difficult. You're cleverer and better than this, Poppy. Or else you would have let Dani take the fall for all of this. Why don't you give yourself a chance? Try. Try at something. Show him that you can rise to the occasion. You've already released Miss Brown form her idea of servitude\" they both smiled at that. \"Because judging by the outfits you created last night,\" Mrs. Kingsley continued, \"when you put your mind to something, you can do it. Don't give up on yourself. Because I haven't. And neither has your father. Now, off you go\" Dani had left Drippy and Kate to wait for Poppy and joined the other girls in the game. Dani looked over from her over-worked position to see Drippy handing her jersey to Poppy. She grinned. Poppy would have to get over her fear of dirt and germs, and she was going to have to do it the hard way. Dani grinned as she stood back, watching Poppy and Josie put the ball into the goal. It was their first goal, ever. We all cheered and gathered, giving each other hugs and high-fives. The only thing sweeter, Dani thought, was the look on Harriet's face. \"And finally, in news as shocking as the fall of the Berlin Wall, our under-18 lacrosse team has gone through to the second round of the county championships for the first time since 1976\" Mrs. Kingsley announced during the assembly. Ever girl in the room cheered. \"To sign up for extra practice, please see Harriet B…oh. My apologies. No, it seems you should see Poppy Moore\" there was no cheering, but it seemed like every girl was whispering to her neighbor. Dani grinned. Poppy found her something. \"Alright people, choose a goal buddy\" Poppy ordered. Dani was going to play coach's assistant to Poppy, a position she was more than familiar with. \"From now on, each sentence starts with 'I will,' not 'I want to.'\" \"I will want to saliva vomit if we have to call each other buddy\" Drippy growled. \"Shut up\" was all Poppy said. \"Hit it\" Dani pressed the button on the boom box she had brought. \"I'm giving us an aggression makeover\" Poppy explained before the music started playing.[Chapter 6] A/N – Alright, so I'm not quite sure how you'll take this chapter, but I hope you like it! Poppy and Dani drilled the team tirelessly, running two drills at a time, working the girls' stamina as well as their skills. Abbey Mount vs. Bodley Manor was their next match. They won. \" Congratulations once again to our uder-18 lacrosse team who beat Bodley Girls on Saturday, 5-2. Well done \" Mrs. Kingsley announced at the next assembly. Time was flying for Poppy and Dani. Abbey Mount vs. Oxley, the Quart Final. Win. Abbey Mount vs. Our Lady, Semi Final. Win. \"And the groundbreaking news is that Abbey Mount is through to the lacrosse championships final \" Dani found Poppy in the computer room, writing another e-mail to Ruby. \"Poppy, come on! You've got the finish my hair before Freddie gets here\" Dani called to the other girl. Dani's gorgeous hair was no longer knee length, as she never planned to pull it up again and that length was impractical. Before they started serious lacrosse, the girls had cut off several feet of Dani's hair, so it only reached to just above her lower back, still much longer than most girls. \"One sec\" Poppy finished her sentence and ran up to me. \"Here\" she pulled a simple black headband out of her bag and set it in Dani's hair so it wasn't pulling anything back, it was simply decoration. It matched perfectly with her simply blue jeans and green baby-T. \"Lover boy's outside\" Drippy said from behind the girls. Dani giggled and raced outside. \"Freddie!\" Freddie looked up from where he was seated on the hood of his car to see Dani racing toward him. He stood and help him arms out to her. Dani launched herself at him. His arms wrapped around her waist, hers around his neck, as he lifted her off her feet and swung her around. Dani almost couldn't breath from laughing as he finally set het down. \"Hi\" she grinned t him. Freddie chuckled at the anti-climactic greeting. \"Come on, trouble. Let's go\" Freddie led her to the passenger seat and opened the door for her. \"Chivalry isn't dead\" Dani nodded approvingly. \"Well, I'm hoping to win myself some points\" Freddie 'admitted'. Dani just shook her head and smiled as Freddie got into the driver's seat. Freddie grinned as he watched her staring at the beautiful town. He loved the childish excitement in her eyes as she took it all in. He was slightly sad that she had cut her hair, but it didn't change how she looked in his eyes. Dani stared out at the water as she and Freddie sat together under a warm blanket. \"You know, there are only three main facts about my life\" Dani mused to him. \"Yeah? What are they?\" he asked, curious about the girl in his arms. Dani was sitting in between Freddie's legs, leaning against his chest. \"Well, fact number one is I never actually know my parents\" she told him. \"But I thought…\" \"They died in an accident when I was a toddler. I was raised by my aunt until she died a year after we moved to the states. I was nine\" she explained. \"Fact number two, I am a complete doormat\" he laughed at her blunt statement. \"It's true! I used to always let Poppy walk all over me. Every time she got into trouble for something, I got in trouble as well, just because I was her permanent shadow\" \"How did you even get involved with Poppy? Why are you here with her?\" Freddie asked. \"That actually ties into fact number three. I'm Poppy Moore's adopted sister\" Freddie gasped – in a totally manly way – in surprise. \"Really?' he asked. He couldn't believe it. Dani nodded. \"Gerry Moore adopted me six months after my aunt's death. I was new, and scared, and weak, and Poppy took advantage of that. I became her slave, basically. I used to call her and her sister Miss Poppy and Miss Molly and I always called Gerry Mr. Moore, despite is constantly asking me to call him 'Gerry' or 'Dad'. I was more like hired help than family\" Dani told him. \"Wow\" Freddie couldn't think of anything to say. \"Mind-blowing, huh?\" Then, Freddie remembered what Dani had said at the social. \"Are you up to explaining what you side at the social?\" he asked her softly. Dani nodded sadly. \"Before I say anything, I want you to know that I won't hold it against you if you leave me here and never want to talk to me again\" she said. Freddie couldn't imagine what she could say to make him want to never talk to her again. \"Poppy was planning on getting expelled so she could go home. All those pranks, messing with Matron's car, that was us trying to help her get out. Then one of the girls thought of a sure-fire way to get her out of here. Get caught with you. \"Poppy wouldn't do it. She knew I really liked you. But she's family, so I volunteered to do it. I figured, I Poppy getting expelled got me expelled, wouldn't it work the same in reverse?\" \"So you were going to use me?\" Freddie asked, almost mad. Dani nodded. \"That was the plan. But after talking to you, I couldn't do it. I was planning on telling you everything today from the start, but then Poppy decided she didn't want to leave. I'm not using you, and I wasn't going to. I really wanted to be out here with you, Freddie. I really like you\" Dani admitted. Her voice had gotten softer and softer, as if she was expecting him to get angry and lash out at her. Yes, he was a little mad about them planning on using him, but after listening to Dani's pleaded, he couldn't stay mad at her. Freddie stood and pulled Dani up gently, turning her so he was facing her. He lifted her chin so she would look at him. \"I'm not mad, not at you. Because, Daniella Brown, I really like you too\" he whispered before his lips met hers in a soft kiss. Both teenagers were in bliss. It was impossible to ignore the strong connection the two had. It took all of Dani's strength not to let her knees fold on her and she leaned into Freddie to keep from falling. The kiss deepened and Dani found herself getting dizzy and her tongue battled with his. They broke away only when they had to breathe. \"Wow\" Dani gasped. Freddie could feel her sweet breath on his lips. \"Maybe we should move on. I don't think I'll be in control of my actions if we stay here\" she murmured, staring at his lips. \"One more\" he whispered against her lips, kissing her once more before pulled away completely. \"Come on\" he grabbed her hand and tugged her along. \"Let's get something to eat\" Freddie came back to the table with food. \"Here you go, Trouble\" he said, setting the food in front of her and sitting down beside her. \"Bread and chips?\" Dani asked, giggling slightly. \"If I affect your life in no other way, then allow me this honor, the humble chip butty\" He put a few cps on the bread and folded it in half. \"Here you go\" he handed it to her. Dani looked at Freddie unwaveringly. \"Freddie, you've already affect my life so much. I don't think it'll ever be the same\" she said quietly. Freddie swooped down and kissed her, no hesitation. \"Something else\" Dani said slowly, pulling away. \"This is my first date. Ever\" she told him. Freddie raised his eyebrows in surprise. \"Ever?\" Dani nodded. \"And my first kiss\" Freddie smiled. \"Then I'm honored\" he whispered, kissing her cheek gently before letting her eat her chip butty. \"This is really good\" Dani gushed, her eyes wide when she realized she liked it. Freddie chuckled. \"I'm glad you like it\" \"There's something about you, Daniella Brown. Every moment I'm with you, I catch my breath\" he told her softly. Dani smiled and blushed softly before looking at him through her lashed. \"You've caught my heart\" she told him. Freddie smiled and grabbed her arm, pulling her out of the public restaurant. Dani squealed as she came into the room, jumping on the bed that Kiki and Drippy were sitting on. \"Hi\" she said breathlessly. The girls forced smiles on their faces. \"Did you have fun?\" Drippy asked. Dani blushed. \"I think I'm in danger\" she told the others. They all gasped. \"Of what?\" Josie asked, worried. \"Falling in love with Freddie Kingsley\" they all smiled slightly at her. It was then Dani realized the somber air of the room. \"What's wrong?\" she asked, looking from face to face. Kate handed her the paper. Dani's eyes skimmed it, her frown deepening as she read. \"Where's Poppy?\" she asked as she finished, handing it back to Kate. \"Supposedly in the library, planning out more training for finals\" Josie told her. Just then, Poppy walked in happily. Her smile dropped when she saw the looks on the five other girl's faces. 'What happened?\" she asked. \"'Dear Ruby,'\" Kate read from memory. \"'you cannot imagine how retarded these idiot are. They're a bunch of ugly losers who think a mani-pedi is a Latin greeting. I despise these village idiots, but I have to pretend to live them so they'll help me get out of this hell hole. I tried doing it on my own, and it was impossible.'\" Kate couldn't read anymore, so Drippy took the letter from her and continued. \"'Daniella is not much better. She foolishly believes I actually care about her. As if. As soon as I'm back home, she's gone. They're all so thick they'll never realize my disgust. I'll be out of this asylum by the end of term.'\" Drippy folded the piece of paper in half. \"I didn't write that\" Poppy told them \"I mean, hardly any of it, just the loser part. But that was weeks ago\" \"Well, it's dated today and it's from your e-mail address\" Josie snapped. Dani couldn't speak, she was holding back tears. Kiki was rubbing her back soothingly. Dani was the baby of the group, and they all felt protective of her, like mother bears. \"Where did you get it?\" Poppy asked. \"It was taped to the door\" Kiki told her. \"You're a seriously horridious cow\" Drippy told her, standing, shoving the letter at Poppy, and walking away. Kiki and Josie walked away, bot holding onto one side of Dani, taking her away from Poppy. Dani started crying. \"This just doesn't seem like Poppy, you know? And how did it get taped to the door, anyway? How would someone get into her e-mail? Why would they? And if they got into her e-mail, who simply print out an e-mail, why not just make one up\" Dani was rambling, hysterical. The girls got Dani calmed down enough, so now she was sitting in the Commons, waiting for the next blow-up. It would happen sooner than she thought. Freddie found a printed-out e-mail sitting in front of his door. He picked it up and found that it was from Dani, to someone. ' So, all I have to do is hook up with the headmistress' son, and it's a sure thing that they'll expel me, meaning Poppy will go too. He's a total English dweeb. Pretty gross, but an easy target. Give me a week tops, with Poppy's help. ' He stormed down to the Commons, where he knew she'd be. \"Dani!\" he cried, getting all of the girls' attention, including Harriet's. Dani looked up, and you could still see the tears running down her face. For a moment, Freddie faltered, but he shook it off. \"Tell me this isn't true\" he shook the paper in his hand. \"Tell me!\" \"Freddie…\" Dani started to plead, but Freddie shook his head in disgust. \"Just, stay away from me, got it\" he started walking away. \"Stay away!\" The room was deadly silent as he left. Dani silently picked up her things and headed outside. No one followed her, and no one noticed the smug smile on Harriet's face.[Chapter 7] A/N – Please don't kill me. Read this before you make any set plans to become an executioner. Thanks AnaleighJames for being my faithful reviewer for this story. Dani sat out back, drying her tears when she felt two warm, strong arms wrap around her. \"I'm sorry you had to go through that\" he whispered into her neck before gently kissing the sensitive spot from behind her. \"It's all right. I just feel back for Poppy. I know those letters were faked\" Dani sighed, turning to face Freddie. \"There's no proof\" he told her. She nodded sadly. \"I'm so glad I told you before everything blew up\" she said, leaning her forehead against his chest. \"Be glad whoever did this doesn't know you very well. I know for a fact that you don't have an e-mail yet, and that everything in that letter is no longer true\" Freddie said, hugging her tightly. \"That's not true\" Dani protested. Freddie gave her a shocked look. \"You were never an English dweeb, gross, or an easy target\" she said, kissing him lightly on the lips. Freddie smiled. \"Good\" Dani sighed again and pulled away. \"I guess I'll have to wait for the other girl's to figure it out. I'll be no help. I hate this! I don't want to stay away from you\" Dani cried, hugging him tightly, never wanting to let go. \"I know. It was hard enough not getting caught by staff, or Mum, but if whoever did this catches us again…\" he trailed off, not wanting to think about it. \"It had to be Harriet. She's the only one that would do something like that to Poppy and make such an effort to break us up\" Dani said firmly. \"Even so, we can't do anything about it yet. But we both know it's not true, and even if she doesn't know it, Poppy has someone on her side\" he said, kissing her once more before leaving her alone. Later that night, Dani awoke to Kate waking everyone up, and the fire alarm going off. Dani got up and, seeing the fire, promptly started helping Kate and Poppy get everyone up and out. All the girls were collected outside while Mrs. Kingsley did a roll call. Dani and Freddie's eyes met and he frowned, seeing her terrified expression. But he couldn't do anything, not now. \"Susan Casey\" \"Here\" \"Daisy Bevin\" \"Here\" \"Can't hear you, Daisy!\" \"Here\" \"Jennifer Logan\" Nothing, not even a whisper. \"Jennifer? Has anyone seen Drippy? Come on, girls! Who was the last person to see Drippy?\" \"Drippy's in the freezer!\" Poppy cried. Both she and Dani raced towards the burning building, Dani was faster, so she got into the burning building first. \"Drippy!\" both girls shouted. All the others were standing outside stood, open-mouthed, watching and listening to the two girls that had run into a burning building for a classmate. Freddie stared at the building in horror. If anything happened to Dani…he wouldn't know what to do with himself. Suddenly, two firemen came out, leading a chocking Poppy and a shaking Drippy. Everyone held their breath when they noticed the third girl wasn't there. \"Come on\" Freddie whispered. \"Come on\" A third fireman came out, carrying a weak, but conscious Dani out of the building. Everyone clapped and cheered. \"You are two very foolish, very brave girls. Will you be alright Dani?\" Mrs. Kingsley asked. Dani weakly nodded. \"Nothing some water, clean air, and lots of rest won't fix, ma'am\" she said, her voice weak and hoarse. Mrs. Kingsley smiled at how, even in this state, Dani was still so proper and said, \"all right, off to the ambulance now\" Freddie followed the fireman into the room the fire had started in. \"My God\" he cried, seeing the damage. \"What do you think happened?\" he asked while his mother took care of the three girls. \"Don't know yet. We're lucky, couldn't been a lot worse\" the fireman told Freddie. Freddie looked down and spotted two shiny objects. Both were familiar, one silver charm bracelet, and one I heart LA lighter. Dani and Poppy walked down the halls. Every girl they passed thanked them, only making Poppy feel worse. Dani was still weak, but she was walking on her own. They were passed a small alcove when Freddie grabbed her arm. Dani looked at Poppy and nodded her head, silently telling the girl to go on. Poppy reluctantly left her sister behind. \"I found these\" he told her, holding out the lighter and the bracelet. \"Where did you find them?\" Dani asked, grabbing them. \"In the room the fire started\" he told her flatly. Dani looked up him. \"I was asleep. And my bracelet was missing days ago, so I'm clear. But Poppy… she was down there, and the curtain caught on fire. But she put them out, she's sure of it. She left all of her things behind, because she was empty-handed when she came back. It's possible she didn't put it out, but…she heard footsteps\" Freddie peered down at her. \"Poppy had heard footsteps. What if it wasn't a teacher, but another student out of bed? They could have started the fire\" \"But you have no proof. And if Poppy thinks she did it…It'll go to the Honor Court\" Freddie said sadly. Dani started crying. \"Why does this all have to go bad now that we want to stay?\" she asked, expecting no answer. Freddy just held her. She was still weak and felt very frail to him, her shaking only making it worse. \"Come on he lifted her up. \"I'll take you to your dorm\" \"Poppy\" she turned to see Dani standing behind her. Dani was holding out her I heart LA lighter, and Poppy knew what that meant. Poppy started crying. \"it's okay, it's all okay, it'll be okay\" Dani murmured, holding the weeping girl close and rocking her, doing her best to comfort her sister. \"Someone here knows exactly what happened last night. What we're clear on is that this fire was no accident\" Mrs. Kingsley was explaining to all of the girls later that day. \"If you have the sense to own up, no legal charges will be filed. If not, it will be passed on to the local authorities. You have until the end of the day to come forward\" With that, they were all dismissed. Dani swallowed hard, know what she had to do. ' Dearest Freddie, I wish I had the courage to tell you this in person. I want to stay here, with you, I truly do, but I can't. She's my sister, and I hope you can understand that. Because my bracelet was there as well. Whoever did this, meant for me to go as well. As much as I'm hoping whoever did this is caught, I'm not holding my breath. But Poppy needs me. Poppy is going to turn herself in, and I'm going with her. You know, as well as I, how this looks and what the likelihood of me ever seeing you again is. And I want to tell you one thing before we have to go: I think I'm in love with you, Freddie Kingsley. That one, beautiful day with you was enough for me to fall completely and helplessly in love with you, and I just wanted you to know. ' Poppy stood in front of the headmistress' door, about to knock when she heard someone cry, \"Poppy, wait!\" Running to her was Dani, clutching her burnt charm bracelet. \"Dani, what are you doing?\" Poppy hissed as Dani stopped beside her. Dani grabbed Poppy's hand tightly. \"We're sisters. And sisters don't let each other fall alone, right? No matter what, I am going to be here with you, every step of the way\" Poppy swallowed hard. \"I can't lt you do that\" she started to say, but Dani shook her head. \"Don't. You mean more to me than any bloody English boarding school ever could\" Dani told her, hugging her. She pulled away and both girls squared their shoulders. \"Let's get this over with\" Poppy knocked on the door. \"Come in\" Mrs. Kingsley's voice was heard clearly through it. \"No turning back now\" Dani whispered before they entered. \"Oh, what can I do for you girls?\" Mrs. Kingsley asked when she noticed who it was that entered her office. Both girls moved at the same time as they set the burnt objects in their hands onto her desk, as if they were robots. Mrs. Kingsley picked up the lighter in one hand and the bracelet in the other hesitantly. \"It's what I used to start it. It was an accident, and I thought I put it out\" Poppy explained. \"but I guess not. Obviously not\" \"Oh, Poppy\" Mrs. Kingsley sighed before looking at Dani. Without her having to say a word, Dani explained, \"I was with her. I have been with her every step of the way\" Mrs. Kingsley knew that Dani wasn't really with Poppy that night, especially because she had reported her bracelet missing several days ago. But she could say nothing. \"You two realize what this means, don't you?\" she asked sadly. Both girls nodded sadly. \"Will we be expelled?\" Poppy asked, not liking her sister was involved, but slightly happy she wasn't alone. \"The Honor Court will decide, but I suspect you'll understand that it's just a formality at this point\" she told the teenagers. \"The weird thing is I really did try to turn it around\" Poppy explained. \"I didn't want to disappoint you. I'm so sorry\" \"I'm so sorry, too, girls\" Mrs. Kingsley said sadly. \"Mrs. Kingsley\" she turned her attention to Dani. \"May I speak with you for a moment?\" Dani asked. Mrs. Kingsley nodded and Dani nodded at Poppy, telling her it was okay to leave her. Dani looked at Mrs. Kingsley. \"If this isn't enough to get me expelled, I suspect what I'm about to explain would do it\" she sighed, leaning forward in her seat. \"I don't understand, Dani\" Mrs. Kingsley said, wondering what on Earth the girl could have done. Dani sighed. \"I've been seeing Freddie, despite the fact that fraternizing is forbidden. I went out with him once, and we've been meeting whenever we could when we didn't have classes or homework or some other responsibility. I know that it's against the rules, and I just wanted you to know, because I despised the thought of deceiving you\" Mrs. Kingsley nodded. \"But I would also like you to know that I will not apologize for it\" Mrs. Kingsley looked at her in surprise. \"Mrs. Kingsley, I love you son, despite the little time we've been together. Whether he feels the same or not doesn't matter, but I do love him very much. I was hoping you would be willing to give him this letter. I doubt I will ever get the chance to see him again after this\" Dani stood and handed the letter to Mrs. Kingsley before heading out. \"Dani\" the girl stopped and looked back. \"For what it's worth, I cannot imagine a better girl for my son\" she said with a soft smile. Dani smiled sadly and left. She found Poppy standing outside, looking miserable. The girls shared their brief stories before something on the wall behind Dani caught Poppy's eyes. It was a picture, of the 1976 Abbey Mount under-18 lacrosse team. In the middle, the captain's position, was a woman that looked almost exactly like Poppy. \"Mom?\" Poppy gasped. Poppy had gone off to ponder the picture of her mom. Dani was sitting on the seats where she and Freddie had almost had their first kiss, fingering the charm bracelet. \"Hey\" Dani looked behind her to see Freddie. \"I've been looking for you\" Dani gave him a watery smile. Freddie held up her letter. \"So, you told my Mum. I thought I wasn't going to get to see you again\" he told her, setting the letter down and sitting beside her. Dani looked down at the bracelet in her hands, Mrs. Kingsley hadet her keep it, despite protocol. \"This and the photograph in my room are the only things I have left of my parents\" she told him, crying softly. \"Oh, Dani\" he wrapped his arms around her and pulled her closer, so she was sitting in his lap. \"It'll be okay\" he whispered in her ear, trying to calm her. \"I don't want to leave\" she sobbed into his chest. \"But I can't leave Poppy, she part of the only family I have left!\" He rubbed her back in slow, soothing circles and Dani slowly calmed. \"I love you too\" he whispered into her ear. Dani smiled at him, but they both turned when they heard the sound of footsteps approaching before she could say anything. Poppy appeared around the corner. \"Time to face the music\" she told her sister sadly. Dani nodded and stood, holding onto Freddie's hand until she no longer could as she walked away.[Chapter 8] A/N – Sorry it's been so long. I got distracted and bored. \"It is with great regret and sadness that we call the Honor Court to session\" Harriet said. \"It will henceforth be our job to objectively and dispassionately ascertain what happened that fateful night that will hence to forth long blight the memory of this proud institution\" Dani grabbed Poppy's hand as they both noticed their dorm mates weren't there. \"It is your duty to understand the dark forces that drove a seemingly…\" \"Harriet\" Mrs. Kingsley snapped, making the girl stop mid-sentence. \"May I remind you that the Honor Court is no place for your personal grandstanding, and that Poppy and Daniella has a right to speak in her own defense before the Court as a whole passes judgment?\" \"Thank you Mrs. Kingsley\" Poppy said as Harriet sat down. Dani stood first. \"A lot of you probably don't believe I belong here. After all, worst-come-to-worst, I was only a by-stander. But, imagine if she was completely alone. Outcasted by the very people she loved and defended, with no one else, the entire school against you simply because of where you come from and how you were raised to act. Would you abandon you sister as well?\" At the sounds of the students' gasps, Dani nodded. \"Yes, Poppy Moore is my sister, through adoption, but that does not make our bond any less strong. I know how it feels to be isolated because you are different because I was in the exact same situation as she is, only reversed; a Brit among Californians. And I will stand by her till the end. \"Because my fate today does not matter. If Poppy Moore is expelled today, I will follow her out those doors, knowing we are both better people for being here, if only for this brief time\" Poppy stood while Dani sat back down. \"I won't insult everybody by trying to defend myself, my actions, or my sister\" Poppy paused as both she and Dani noticed their friends quietly entering the Court. \"So, uh, I think it's safe to say that I've really messed up. And I apologize profusely. \"But I'm also so grateful to you all. I tried really hard to get out of this school, and only now do I realize just how much I want to stay. I've learned so much being here. Being with all of you. And in some ways being with my mom, who I found out was actually a student here. \"I've had a hole in my heart for five years, and somehow being here, it slowly started to heal. I know I may have looked like a California girl, but in my heart I've discovered that I really am an Abbey Mount girl.\" \"Objection!\" Harriet shouted, standing. \"Sustained\" she said for herself, which was not right. \"The Court will heretofore disregard the previous statements and perhaps heretofore we can begin the real business. Can you tell us, in your own words, where were you on the aforementioned evening of…\" But again, Harriet was interrupted by Mrs. Kingsley. \"Honestly, Harriet. Who else's words do you expect them to use?\" Mrs. Kingsley asked sarcastically. \"Just leave this to me\" Properly scolded, Harriet sat down again. \"Poppy, were you in the cook's sitting room on the night of the fire?\" \"Yes, I was\" \"Daniella?\" \"Yes ma'am\" Dani lied through her teeth. \"Were you there with permission?\" \"No. I was not\" \"No ma'am\" \"Did you intend on starting a fire, Poppy?\" \"Not really\" \"Objection\" again, Harriet stood. \"Does the defendant mean yes or no?\" she snapped. \"Harriet\" Mrs. Kingsley scolded again. She sat down. \"It means no, I had no intention of actually doing it\" Poppy answered. \"Was anyone else with you, beside Miss Brown?\" Mrs. Kingsley asked. \"Not as far as I know\" both girls shook their heads. \"I was\" Kate stood. \"I was\" Drippy stood as well. Well, Drippy was actually there. \"I was\" Josie. \"I was\" Kiki. \"I was\" \"I was\" girl after girl stood, until every girl in the entire room but Harriet stood. Poppy and Dani shared a grin. \"Objection!\" Harriet shouted again, leaping out of her seat once again. \"Stop! Order!\" but she was ignored. Finally, after the last girl said 'I was' Harriet shrieked, \"This is ridiculous! What are you all doing? You're lying. They're lying, Mrs. Kingsley! This is a conspiracy. You can't expel the whole year, and they know that\" Mrs. Kingsley slammed her gavel down. \"Be quiet, Harriet! Sit down, everyone\" \"It's a black-and-white case\" Harriet continued. \"They have to be expelled! The girl set for to the school, endangering all our precious lives, and her sister \" Harriet sneered, \"Stood by and helped! She walked in there, lighter at the ready, and tried to burn the place down\" it was then Dani grinned. Harriet had slipped up. \"Lighter?\" Jane asked. \"Not now, Jane. Have respect for court protocol\" Dani snorted, Harriet wasn't respecting protocol. \"What lighter, Harriet?\" Charlotte asked. \"Jesus, Charlotte, how daft can you possibly be? That ridiculous 'I heart LA' lighter of hers. She left it behind for God's sakes, along with Daniella's bracelet!\" \"Except, how do you know that, Harriet?\" Jane asked. \"No one's mentioned a lighter before, or a bracelet\" Harriet seemed to realize her slip-up, and her face froze in panic. \"What? Yes, they have\" she insisted. \"Objection\" she said quietly, sitting down. \"Actually, Harriet, they haven't\" Jane told the tall girl. \"I have to second Jane's question, Harriet\" Mrs. Kingsley said slowly. \"How did you know about that lighter? And where did you hear about the bracelet. Miss Daniella had reported it missing from her Sports locker a week ago\" there went the evidence against Dani, but it didn't matter to her anymore. \"Well, I…\" Harriet tried to come up with a reason. \"Freddie found the lighter, and my bracelet before anyone saw it\" Dani said. \"How could you possible know unless…unless you were there?\" Poppy figured it out. \"Well, this is absurd. I refuse to sit here and listen to these wild…\" Harriet tried to say, but Poppy continued. \"I had put it out. And I heard footsteps. It must have been you. Oh, my God. You restarted the fire, didn't you?\" Poppy asked her. \"Harriet, is this true?\" Mrs. Kinsley asked. It was one thing when Poppy started it on accident, but if Harriet re started it on purpose… \"Of course not\" Harriet assured her. \"It all makes sense, now. I knew it. I think I'm innocent\" Poppy realized. 'We think so, too\" Jane and Charlotte chimed. \"You're not!\" Harriet growled, having enough. \"You awful bitch! You've turned this school upside down. You and your sister ruined everything!\" Harriet cried. \"You started it. I only finished what you started!\" There it was. Harriet's round-about confession. \"Harriet? My office, now\" Mrs. Kingsley ordered. Everyone ran up to hug Dani and Poppy. Dani slowly extracted herself from the crowd, feeling that this was ore Poppy's hour than hers. Dani walked over to Mrs. Kingsley. \"So, what you sid about me and Freddie…\" Dani trailed off. Mrs. Kingsley laughed. \"It still stands. As long as you focus on schoolwork and your responsibilities, as it seems you have already, I have no problem with you seeing my son\" Dani beamed. Dear Diary, this is my first entry, as you're new, but I felt I should write today. The under-18 lacrosse finals are today. I've taken myself off the team. I prefer standing with Freddie on the sidelines while My sister saves the day. How I love saying that: my sister. It has a nice feeling. Dani shut her diary and set it in her trunk when she heard a knock on the door. She looked up to see her boyfriend – insert squeal here – standing in her doorway. \"Come on, we're going to be late\" he said, holding out his hand. Dani smiled and stood, walking to his side. With his arm wrapped around his girlfriend's shoulders, Freddie grinned as he kissed her temple and led them to the field. They stood at the opposite end of the sidelines as Mrs. Kingsley, who had asked Dani to call her Jenna. It was still slightly awkward for them, having Mrs. Kingsley's permission. \"Go Poppy! Come on! Come on Abbey Mount!\" Dai cried, jumping up and down. Then, Dani happened to look over at Mrs. Kingsley and she saw someone unexpected. \"Mrs. Kingsley\" Gerry greeted his daughters' headmistress. \"Oh, Mr. Moore, you made it!\" she greeted happily from her seat. \"Yes, I did\" \"Please, come and take a seat\" she gestured towards a random chair. \"Did I miss much?\" he asked about the game. \"No, not at all\" \"Dad!\" Gerry turned at the familiar voice saying such an unfamiliar word, to see Dani running towards him. At least, he thought it was Dani. Her hair was loose, reaching just above her lower back, and she was wearing a black skirt that reached just above her knees with a green T-shirt and her stilettos. You couldn't get her out of them. \"Dani?\" he asked, shocked, as the girl launched herself at the man. \"Dad, what are you doing here?\" \"Mrs. Kinsley called… since when did you call me dad?\" he asked, still shocked. Dani smiled and rolled her eyes as a blond boy came up behind her. \"Dad, you're so far behind. Speaking of change, there's Poppy!\" she said, pointing down the field. Gerry turned to see, not the Poppy he was expecting, but an almost perfect twin to her mother. \"She's the spitting image of her mother, isn't she?\" Mrs. Kingsley asked as Freddie wrapped his arms around Dani again. \"She most certainly is\" Gerry agreed. Both Freddie and Dani were hunched over laughing as they watched the girl's performance. After a tension-filled game, Abbey Mount won against Stowe, 3-2. Everyone crowded around the team, cheering. Freddie, Dani, and Gerry all walked over. \"Poppy!\" Gerry called. Poppy looked over and smiled in surprise. \"Dad? My dad! My dad! What are you doing here?\" she asked, hugging him. \"Mrs. Kingsley called. She told me you found out about Mom\" Gerry explained. \"Why didn't you tell me, Dad?' Poppy asked. \"I'm sorry, Poppy. I thought it might make you too sad. I did know that you needed to breathe a different kind of air, though. Both of you\" he said, hugging he girls together again. \"Did I do the right thing?\" he asked. Poppy glance around her and then at Dani and Freddie's intertwined hands before looking back at her dad. \"You did. Did you know Mom was captain of the lacrosse team?\" she asked. \"Yes. And I also know that she is incredibly proud of you right now, as am I\" he told her. Poppy smiled, and then wrapped an arm around Dani's shoulder from her free side. \"I couldn't have done it without my sister\" Gerry looked slightly surprised that Poppy called Dani her sister, but smiled all the same.[Chapter 9] A/N – This is it! No more! I'm done! Poppy and Dani – as well as Kate, Kiki, Josie, and Drippy – finished off the semester, as well as the year. Harriet was replaced by a rather quiet, but really sweet girl in her year. Every Saturday, unless Dani had something to attend to or he was at school, Freddie was allowed to take her out. The girls continued to gain popularity until they basically ruled the school. But they were always rather nice about it, and were not very…Californian about it. After the school year was over, it was planned that Freddie, Drippy, Kate, Kiki, and Josie would hall spend at least half the summer in Malibu with Dani and Poppy. Finally, mid-July, The Moore family – because Dani had finally officially changed her last name to Moore, until she gets married that it – waited at the airport with Ron for their five friends. \"Finally, Dani caught sight of messy blond hair that could only belong to one person. \"Drippy! Over here!\" Dani started jumping up and down, trying to get her attention. Drippy finally noticed then and looked behind her, where the others stood, motioning them to follow her. \"Hey\" Dani grinned, holding still as Freddie wrapped his arms around her in a hug. \"Hello, trouble\" he greeted fondly, kissing her head. 'Hello Moore, Poppy Moore\" he still teased her about that. The group never explained to Mrs. Kingsley or Mr. Moore why, tough. \"Freddie, this is my best friend and Poppy's proper boyfriend, Ron. Ron, this is Freddie\" Dani introduced, ignoring Poppy's cry at her dig at Roddy. After the introductions were made, they all loaded into the limo – yes, a limo – and headed to the Moore household. Drippy got along really well with Molly, who loved talking about food with her. When the group wasn't together as a whole, the smaller groups broke up to be: Poppy and Kate, Drippy and Molly, with Kiki and Josie going in between. Ron was always with Poppy. Freddie and Dani were often by themselves, just enjoying their time together. One night, Freddie and Dani were sitting outside, looking up at the stars. \"You know, in a couple months I'll be eighteen\" Freddie told her, drawing random patterns on her arm. \"I turned seventeen last June, on the 21st\" she told him. \"Your birthday's on the Summer Solstice?\" he asked. Dani nodded. \"I always found that little fact to be pretty cool\" she told him. \"Anyway, I'll be going to University while you finish off school at Abbey Mount. So, I wanted to give you this\" he held out a small ring. The band was silver and there was a little green jewel. \"It's not an engagement ring, nor was it really expensive, because I know you hate that\" he said, knowing her too well. \"I just, I want you to have something to remind you of me when I can't be there\" he finished, looking at her. \"It that where you and Poppy and Molly went last week?\" she asked him, laughing slightly. Freddie nodded. Dani sat up and kissed him. \"It's sweet. Thank you\" she slipped it on her finger and they spoke no more for the night. The girls were lined up against the edge of the pool on their floaties, all wearing sunglasses and bikinis. Freddie was on the patio net to the pool, his head right next to Dani's. Ron was next to him, his head next to Poppy's. He couldn't keep his eyes off of her. Her green bikini didn't hide a lot, and he was soaking up the image of her skin while he could. Suddenly, Poppy's phone started ringing. \"Give it here\" Dani asked. He handed Poppy's phone to her, asking, \"Who's Ruby?\" It took Dani a moment to answer, as she was busy ogling her boyfriends naked chest. \"Nobody\" Poppy told him. \"Just some horridious cow we used to know\" Dani finished, rejecting the call and handing the phone back to Freddie. Ron laughed, knowing exactly who it was. \"Can't do it?\" Kiki asked as they all stood together, arms locked. \"No way!\" Josie cried. \"You're completely insane\" Kate added. \"But you're still here, aren't you?\" Dani laughed. Freddie and Ron sat back and watched the girls interact. \"Are you guys ready?\" Poppy asked. \"No\" \"One\" \"Two\" \"THREE!\" And they jumped into the ocean.

Okay, I know you might be thinking, \"This story looks familiar…\" Well, that's because it is. I started this a few years ago when I had more time on my hands, but I've since become very busy and pretty much dropped writing totally. But I'm now an English/creative writing major, and before I get into my intense fiction writing classes I'd like to get back into the swing of writing a little each day, any kind of writing really. So I thought, what better way to do that than to go pick up some of my old fanfiction stories that I never finished. So here I am. I have no idea what my password for my original account was, so I just created a new one. So I didn't steal Neseve Sedai's story. I simply am Neseve Sedai under a new pen name. Anyways, I'll get on with the story now. I have reposted my 10 original chapters here (with some editing), and I hope to have a few new chapters up A.S.A.P. Thank you for reading! Fateful Meeting Fallon pulled the hood of her cloak up, hiding her dark hair and fair face. It provided little protection from the drenching rain and powerful gusts of wind. She had been riding for two days straight looking for this place, and now she had found it. It wasn't until five days ago that she had found out that the people that she was living with, the people she had always thought were her parents, were not. She recalled their conversation vividly. When Fallon came home from a full day of riding, her mother, Erin, and her father, Willem, met her at the door. She greeted them with a happy smile. It was her sixteenth birthday, and she was hoping there would be some kind of special celebration. But her parents did not return her smile. They stared at her solemnly. \"Fallon, we must speak with you,\" her father said. Fallon knew that this wasn't going to be about her birthday. Both of her parents were too sad and somber. \"What is it?\" she asked warily, \"Did I do something wrong.\" Her mother's sober expression softened a little as she gave her a comforting smile. \"No, dear,\" she soothed, \"Nothing like that. We just need to speak with you about something. That's all.\" Fallon eyed them both suspiciously for another moment then nodded and followed them into the house. Her father led her to their small kitchen table and pulled out a chair. \"I think you had better sit down, lass,\" was all he said. She took the seat, and her parents each took a seat across from her. After what seemed like an eternity of them gazing at her with sad eyes, her mother spoke as she reached across the table and took Fallon's small hand in her own. \"Please, Fallon,\" she said softly, \"Know that we both love you and always will. You do know that, don't you?\" Fallon drew her dark brows together in puzzlement. \"Of course, Mother. Why would you ask such a thing?\" Her mother sighed. \"I just wanted to make sure you knew that before we told you.\" \"Told me what?\" Fallon was becoming quite nervous and frightened. She hardly ever saw her parents act this way. \"What's happened?\" This time her father spoke. \"Fallon, you're sixteen now, a woman. There is something that we have kept hidden from you for fear of how you would react. But we have both decided that since you are a young woman now, you deserve the truth.\" \"What?\" she exclaimed, \"What is it? You must tell me!\" She was frustrated, wondering what her father could be talking about. Why wouldn't he just say it? \"Fallon, we are not your parents.\" She looked from him to her mother, waiting for one of them to crack a smile and say that it was all a big prank… but their faces remained solemn. Suddenly, Fallon was light headed, and she was very glad of the chair. If she had been standing she might have fallen to the floor. \"What?\" she whispered disbelievingly. Her mother, or rather the woman she had always thought was her mother, continued to rub her now shaking hand comfortingly. \"Almost sixteen years ago, your real mother brought you to us, pleading for us to take care of you because she couldn't. Willem and I had been trying to conceive for years without success, we agreed to take you in. We did so want a child. Your mother was weak from giving birth to you. Weak and sick. She stayed with us for two days before she died. It was then that she gave you your name and told us a little of her story.\" Fallon blinked back tears. She drew a shuddering breath and tried to control her emotions. \"Who was she?\" she asked after a moment, \"Who was my father?\" Willem and Erin exchanged a look that Fallon did not miss. This was something that they weren't sure how to tell her. \"Who?\" she repeated. Willem drew a deep breath and said quietly, \"Your mother was Princess Isolde of Ireland. Your father was Tristan of Aerygone.\" Fallon's eyes widened in disbelief. She blinked. What? Every subject of Cornwall knew the story of Tristan of Aerygone, the adopted son of their aging king, Lord Marke, and Isolde, Lord Marke's former wife. Tristan was slain when Donnchadh, the king of Ireland and Isolde's father, attacked the Castle Dor, and Isolde was said to have disappeared. They couldn't be her parents. It couldn't be true. \"How?\" was all she could get out. \"It's true,\" Erin said, nodding, \"She told us that she had been living alone and delivered you by herself. She wanted desperately to know that you would be safe. Even though she did not get to be with you long, she loved you so much.\" The shock was slowly draining out of Fallon, leaving only numbness. She didn't know what to think. Didn't know how to react. \"If my mother was Princess Isolde,\" she said as she stared blankly at the grainy wood of the table. She still stunned that her mother could have been a princess. She certainly did not feel like a princess. \"How do you know that Lord Marke is not my father.\" She didn't understand how they could reason that Tristan was her father. It was definitely a possibility- if Isolde truly was her mother- but they couldn't be sure. Erin gave a small shrug. \"Your mother was sure,\" she said, \"She was positive. She said you looked like him. I never saw him, but she was certain.\" Fallon couldn't hold her emotions in any longer. She dropped her head to her hands and began to cry. It was just so hard to process everything. Not only did she learn that the couple who brought her up were not her real parents, but also that her real parents were nobles. She also cried for never having known them. She loved Erin and Willem with all her heart. The fact that they were not her blood family did not change the way she felt about them at all. But now that she knew that her real mother and father were different people, she longed to know what they were like. Would they have loved her as Willem and Erin did? How would life with them have been? She would never know. Willem grasped her hand in his, and Erin was beside her rubbing her back soothingly. \"There, there, child,\" she murmured, \"It will be alright. You'll see.\" Fallon cried for a while. Finally, she wiped her cheeks and sniffed back her sobs. She turned her face up to Erin. Although they had never met her father, Willem and Erin might be able to tell her something of her mother. \"What was she like?\" Erin smiled sadly. \"Brave and beautiful. Just like you. She was heartsick from the death of your father, but she stayed strong until your birth, wanting to give you the chance of life. You would have loved her.\" \"Do I look like her?\" she asked with a sniff. Willem nodded. \"You have her green eyes and her fair skin. She told us you got your hair from your father and a lot of your facial features. But I can see quite a bit of her in you too.\" \"What else can you tell me about her?\" \"Well….\" They had spent the rest of that day talking about Fallon's parents and her heritage. For the next two days, she contemplated what to do. In the end she decided to journey to the center of Cornwall, to Castle Dor, where her parents had lived, and where, she assumed, she was conceived. She reasoned that maybe if she went there she would be able to find out more about them. The third day after the secret of her past was revealed to her, she packed. Now, here she was, cold and drenched from the rain. She sat, kneeling before two intertwining willows. This was where she had been told her father was buried. Silent tears rolled down her cheeks as she imagined what he must have been like. She kneeled there for what seemed like hours, thinking, until she heard the sound of approaching hoof beats. Fallon dismissed it for a passer-by and did not move, but soon the hoof beats became louder, and she knew that whoever was riding the horse was not simply passing by. In seconds she would no longer be alone. She stiffened her back and sat up straighter but did not turn as the rider came up behind her. The hoof beats stopped. \"Show yourself,\" said a deep male voice, \"Don't try to pull any weapons. I'll have you know that I am rather good with a sword. I don't want to have to kill you today.\" Fallon eased her fingertips away from the hilt of her knife that she kept at her belt. As she slowly turned to face the stranger, she pushed down the hood of her cloak revealing her face and glossy black ringlets. \"I didn't know that it was an offense to simply sit on a river bank, good sir,\" she said, her melodious voice tinged with annoyance, \"I didn't think it would warrant my death.\" The handsome man's dark blue eyes widened. He was obviously surprised to find that he had been threatening a young woman. His sandy blonde curls, wet from the rain, clung to his sun-tanned forehead at an angle. His face was stern, made up of hard planes and angles, but still attractive. He looked to be a few years older than her, maybe 20. \"It is no offense, girl,\" he said a little harshly, regaining his composure, \"Forgive me if hooded and cloaked strangers lurking about in the shadows raise my suspicions. Especially on days like this.\" He looked up at the gloomy sky and shuddered. \"It is a day for ill omens.\" \"Forgive me ,\" Fallon retorted, \"If I am not given to silly superstitions. I had my hood up to keep the rain off my face. Much good that did me.\" The man appeared to be offended by her calling his superstitions silly. \"Pray, what is your name, wench?\" he demanded. Fallon's face reddened all the way to her ears. \"I am no wench!\" she exclaimed angrily, \"You are a filthy pig and would do well to leave me be!\" The man's face also reddened. But then he recovered from his embarrassment and thrust his strong chin up arrogantly. He announced, \" You would do well not to call me a filthy pig. I am Salomon, cousin of Lord Marke and next in line for the throne of Cornwall. You will regard me with respect.\"[Chapter 2] To Castle Dor Salomon turned his head and glared at the irritating young woman riding on her horse beside him. She had been very surprised at the knowledge of who he was, but she still treated him as an equal and it grated on his nerves. He had no idea what had compelled him to offer to take her back to Castle Dor to rest from her travels. It would have been better and a lot more peaceful to have just left her where she was. But he knew he couldn't just leave a defenseless young woman out alone in the cold rain when shelter was so close. And also, something made him suspicious about this woman. It would be best to have her close. She had refused to tell him more of herself and her origin rather than that her name was Fallon and she lived about two days west of there. He decided to try again. \"Who is your family, girl?\" he asked sternly, drawing his eyebrows together over his blue eyes and giving her his most fierce 'I will brook no nonsense' look. She turned in her saddle quickly and leaned over so that her face was close to his. \"I do have a name you know,\" she growled, \"I would be much obliged if you did not call me 'girl.'\" She sniffed. \"I am a woman.\" That she certainly was. She had neglected to pull her hood back up after they left the riverbank, and he had an unobstructed view of her damp black ringlets and lovely heart shaped face. Indeed, she had the body of a woman. As his eyes took in the sight of her petite yet voluptuous figure, he was surprised at his own audacity. Never before had he stared at a woman so impolitely, but even as he mentally berated himself for the action, he could not tear his eyes away from the small expanse of pale cleavage peeking out from the tight bodice of her dress. He forced himself to meet her eyes. Enchanting green eyes that were now lit up with anger and annoyance. \"Alright, Fallon ,\" he said finally, stressing her name, \"But you still have not answered my question.\" She settled back on her mount and glared at him, her pretty pouting lips settled in a frown. \"What if I choose not to answer your question, milord?\" She used the title with heavy sarcasm and Salomon did not miss it. He gritted his teeth and tried to reply civilly. \"I wish that you would. Please.\" Using the word 'please' piqued his irritation even more. She studied him for a moment. \"Fine,\" she replied after a moment, \"But there is not much to know. I am the daughter of two poor peasants, and I wanted to see more of the world. I left my home two days ago. I do not plan to go back for some time. That is all there is to tell.\" He could see no lie in her cool green eyes, but still something about her tugged at his mind, as if warning him that something was amiss. \"Very well,\" he said after a little while later, \"But there is a large storm blowing in. It should be here by this evening or tomorrow morning. I don't know how long it will last, but it seems to be a bad one. You should stay there until it passes.\" \"I thank you for your hospitality,\" she replied icily, \"But it's not as if I've never been out in a storm before. I am not frightened.\" She sniffed and lifted her chin haughtily. Salomon growled under his breath in annoyance at the sensitiveness of this woman. \"I did not accuse you of being frightened,\" he said through clenched teeth, \"I am simply stating the facts that the storm will be bad, and you will need shelter. It is one of my duties to see to the safety of my cousin's people.\" His people, too. His future people, at least. \"You will stay in the castle until the storm passes.\" \"Will you bodily force me to stay?\" she snarled, \"Or would you choose to use sweet reason?\" His anger now at a fever-pitch, he shot back, \"Although I have not known you for more than half an hour, I can already see that no amount of 'sweet reasoning' would work with a woman so hard-headed as you! So, yes, I do plan to bodily force you to stay at Castle Dor until the storm passes if you refuse to stay willingly. If I were you, I would choose to stay willingly. The dungeons are not very comfortable.\" He knew he would not put her into a dungeon really, but she did not know that. Fallon's cheeks reddened in indignation. \"You wouldn't dare.\" \"I would,\" he lied, \"But I won't if you accept my offer.\" \"Fine,\" she spat. Then she turned her head and refused to look at him for a long time. Salomon did not mind. He did not particularly want to argue with her anymore, and he enjoyed admiring her profile as he rode. She was a very beautiful woman. After a while, they could see Castle Dor rising in the distance. He saw Fallon's mouth open a little in awe as she stared at the large structure. She quickly concealed her wonder, and turned to him. \"This is to be where I am staying?\" she said. Salomon nodded and dismounted. He took the reins of her horse lifted his hand to her. She stared at him a moment. Then finally, she placed her hand in his and dismounted. Of its own will, his heart beat faster at the feel of her warm little hand in his. Her skin was so soft and smooth. He longed to bring the small hand up to his lips and kiss it. A throat clearing called him from his thoughts. Fallon stood looking up at him and blushing. He realized that he had not let go of her hand yet. He dropped it with a murmured, \"I'm sorry.\" He began walking away briskly. He called over his shoulder, \"Follow me.\" He did not wait to see if she would.[Chapter 3] A Shadow of the Past Fallon tried to conceal her awe of the largeness of the Castle Dor from Salomon. He already thought her some ignorant peasant. She was not going to give him more cause to think so. As she tried to keep up with his brisk stride, she wondered at the strange look in his eyes as helped her dismount. Behind those dark blue-gray pools was something she couldn't quite place, something that was dangerously close to lust. She had not had much experience with the opposite sex at all in all her sixteen years. She had been admired by some since the years upon entering her womanhood, but none of them had awakened that passionate all-consuming feeling deep within her that she expected to feel when she was in love. No man had touched that cord in her soul that would make her theirs forever. What she had seen in Salomon's eyes frightened her to think about. Had she seen anything ? Could she be imagining it all? That was more likely. After all, he was nearly a king, and although she might by birth be the daughter of a princess, in rearing she was only a peasant's child. As these thoughts passed through her mind, Fallon saw a woman staring at her. The woman was old, older than Erin- her foster mother- with hair that was more gray than brown. The skin of her face was slack with wrinkles. There was nothing really remarkable about her, except for the fact that she was staring at Fallon. Fallon returned the woman's gaze until she was nearly out of sight, and then, puzzled, turned to Salomon. \"That woman back there,\" she said, \"Who was that?\" \"Hmmm?\" He jerked and looked at her a moment. Then turned and looked over his shoulder at the older woman. \"Oh her,\" he continued, turning back to Fallon, \"That is Bragnae. She came here around seventeen years ago with Isolde, the princess of Ireland when she married Marke. She was the princess's maid. After Isolde disappeared, Bragnae remained, having no where else to go. Why?\" \"No reason,\" Fallon replied quickly, \"I was simply wondering.\" He turned his attention back to walking without question. Fallon looked back over her shoulder, searching vainly for the woman, but she had already gone. Fallon felt a pang of anguish in her heart at learning who this woman was. Bragnae, the maid of the Princess Isolde. She could tell Fallon things about her mother, provide her with more information than Erin or Willem could give her. But why had Bragnae been staring at her? She realized that she was falling more and more behind Salomon and had to jog to keep up with his long strides. \"Why don't you walk a little faster?\" she mumbled sarcastically when she finally caught up to him. He turned and looked at her darkly from beneath lowered eyebrows. She wondered why he had become so gloomy all of a sudden. True, he had not been very pleasant company before, but he had not been so dark looking either. The look in his eyes almost made her flinch. \"Keep up,\" he said sternly. Then he continued walking. Fallon huffed and rolled her eyes. \"Could you at least tell me where exactly we're going?\" she demanded. \"First,\" he turned to look at her again. A little of the sarcastic mockery that had been there before returned as he looked her up and down. She suddenly became aware of her drenched hair and cloak, and the way she must appear. She must look like a drowned rat. Her suspicions were confirmed when he continued, \"I'll have you taken to a room and a maid sent up to prepare you. Then I will escort you to dinner where you will meet the king.\" Fallon's eyebrows climbed to the top of her forehead. Meet the king? Bragnae rushed to the room that she had been told to go to. She knew she was to be attending the mysterious girl she saw in the courtyard. The girl who looked startlingly like her former mistress, the princess Isolde. She didn't have the light hair, and some of her facial features were a bit more blunt. But her beautiful emerald eyes, ivory skin, and prominent cheek bones were those of Isolde. It had been almost 17 years since she had last seen the princess. This girl looked to be about 16. The time was right. Could it be? No, she couldn't dare to hope. But as she continued down the hall, the thought kept popping up, unbidden in her mind. Could this be the daughter of Isolde and either Tristan or Lord Marke? Bragnae could not decide who would be the father if- if - this was in fact the long lost daughter of Isolde. It could certainly be either. But something inside Bragnae- some dreamy romantic part of herself- said that if Isolde conceived a child, it would have been Tristan's, a child conceived in love. True, Isolde had come to care for Lord Marke, but not as she loved Tristan. She had loved Tristan enough to risk the king's fury by going out to meet him regularly. And Bragnae knew that she had witnessed only a fraction of the depth of that love. She knew that the love of Tristan and Isolde ran deeper than anyone would ever know or understand. She took a deep breath when she reached the door to the room that she knew the girl would be in. Then she slowly pushed the door open. The startled young woman jumped and turned from the mirror she was looking into to stare at Bragnae. Her cloak was removed and thrown carelessly over a nearby chair. Her dark hair was drenched with rain and clung to her lovely face. Her dress was muddy, wet, and torn in some places. She certainly did not look like the daughter of a princess then. Bragnae had quite a bit of work cut out for her if this young woman was going to meet the king. Bragnae curtsied in greeting. \"Good evening, milady,\" she said meekly. She didn't really look like much of a lady, but if she was to have dinner with the king and Prince Salomon, she must be more than she appeared. \"My name is Bragnae. I am to help you prepare for the evening.\" The girl's sparkling green eyes- Isolde's eyes- widened a fraction. \"Oh,\" she said softly, then a little louder, \"My name is Fallon.\" Fallon. So she finally had a name. She wondered…. No. It couldn't be. It was merely coincidence. \"If you would sit down please, milady,\" Bragnae began, but Fallon interrupted her. \"Please don't call me 'milady,'\" she said hurriedly, an odd look coming into her eyes. \"I am not a lady. Simply call me Fallon.\" Bragnae hesitated a little before replying. It was odd for her to address someone she did not know very well by their first name. Finally she said, \"All right… Fallon, if you would please sit down I can start working on the tangles in your hair.\" Fallon nodded and complied. Bragnae walked to the back of the chair, gently took Fallon's head, and began working out the wet mass of tangles. After a moment, Fallon spoke. \"I saw you in the courtyard,\" she said hesitatingly, \"You were staring at me. Why?\" Bragnae flushed crimson and she was glad the girl could not see her. So she had noticed her staring. How could she have been so careless? Well she might as well answer the girl. \"Oh, aye,\" she began nervously, \"You just… you just looked like someone I used to know. An old charge of mine.\" For some reason, Fallon's face paled visibly. Bragnae drew her brows together and looked at the girl in puzzlement. \"What is it, child?\" she asked, suddenly taking on a familiar and concerned tone that she had not taken often with anybody since Isolde's disappearance. \"I'm sorry for staring, but I…\" \"No, no,\" Fallon said hastily, \"I'm not upset about that. It's just… well… I… Oh, never mind!\" After a moment, Bragnae continued with her brushing. Fallon really would be beautiful when she was cleaned up. That was obvious. She had lovely features under the dirt. She brushed out all of Fallon's long hair until it fell in soft curls down her back and shone. It was still a little damp from the rain- which you could now hear coming down hard outside- but it would dry well before dinner. \"Here,\" she said as she dipped a cloth into a basin of lukewarm water, \"Let me wash the dust off your face.\" She knelt in front of her and began to gently dab at her face. Bragnae noticed that her eyes were bright and shining with unshed tears. This confused her even more. But even as she opened her mouth to speak, Fallon blurted out: \"The charge you spoke of, she was the Princess Isolde.\" It wasn't a question, but Bragnae nodded anyway. \"Yes, I took care of her from the time she was a child until she disappeared almost 17 years ago. Why do you ask?\" Fallon opened her mouth a few times, making soft choking sounds, before speaking. Slowly a tear trickled down her cheek. \"I… She…\" Her voice trailed off to a whisper. \"She was my mother.\" Bragnae's hands fell away from Fallon's face, and she slumped down. What she had suspected was true. Now that Fallon had confirmed it, Bragnae could no longer deny. This was Isolde's child. Her daughter. As she looked into the young woman's eyes it was like looking into the eyes of her mother. She was a shadow of the past.[Chapter 4] Of Lust and Promises Lord Marke of Cornwall set at the head of his great dining table patiently waiting for his dinner guests to arrive. He pondered a few things as he sat in wait, but what piqued his interest most was the young woman who his cousin was bringing to dine with them. It was immensely strange for a common girl to be invited to dine with the king and royal family… but Salomon was going to be king soon- his own health was fading quickly; he couldn't deny it- he could invite who he wanted to dine with them. Marke was pleased with his choice of heir. Salomon, although he sometimes acted with the brash thoughtlessness of youth, was intelligent. He would make a good king. It was a pity that he hadn't had any children of his own though. He had not remarried after Isolde disappeared. So having no sons, he had chosen his cousin to succeed him on the throne. God willing Salomon would have the prospering family that Marke had never had. His future wife, Gwen, the daughter of an Irish prince of Caer-Goch, should be arriving any day now. They would be married almost immediately. Mark prayed for Salomon's sake that she would be fruitful. Suddenly the great doors at the front of the room opened, and Marke looked up. His cousin, Salomon, walked in. Despite being only 19, he already looked like a seasoned warrior. His muscled limbs and chest spoke of relentless training and fierce battle, as did the hardness of his cool blue eyes. But it was not Salomon who riveted Marke's attention. It was who was on Salomon's arm. The girl was younger than his cousin, perhaps 16 or 17, and she was extremely beautiful. Something about her face stirred something in his mind, but he ignored the feeling, for he saw something in Salomon's eyes as he looked down on the young woman. Salomon wanted her. Marke immediately tensed. This was not going to turn out well. It was certainly not unknown for a man to take other lovers and mistresses aside from his wife or his betrothed, but Marke knew Salomon's nature, and he wasn't sure if Salomon would be able to let go when it was time for him to wed the Lady Gwen. And he had to marry Gwen ferch Cynyr. Marke and Salomon had already given their word to Lord Cynyr Ceinfarfog. Salomon bowed low and gave the young woman a pointed stare, after which she curtsied. \"Cousin,\" Salomon said, \"What a pleasure it is to dine with you again this evening.\" He gestured to the young woman. \"This is Fallon. I found her a little ways away and invited her to take shelter here from the storm. I trust you do not mind that she be our guest for a while.\" Yes, Marke wanted to say, but for the sake of courtesy and propriety, he refrained. \"Of course not,\" he said instead with a smile, \"You know any guest of yours is welcome here in Castle Dor, Salomon. Good evening, Fallon,\" he addressed the pretty young woman politely, \"I you are welcome here for as long as you wish to stay.\" Fallon blushed. \"Thank you, Milord,\" she said quietly, not meeting his eyes, \"But I'm sure I must be leaving soon. I have to go….\" She paused thoughtfully. Finally she finished with, \"Somewhere.\" Marke felt a pang of pity rise up in his heart. It was obvious that the girl did not know where to go. He had once felt that some feeling of being lost in the world. It was just before he had been named King of Cornwall. The night that Tristan's parents and his own wife had been slain by the Irish. He only had one objection to Fallon staying in the castle. Salomon. For all through dinner, the young man could barely keep his eyes off her. After dinner Fallon walked around the wide corridors of Castle Dor trying to reach her room so she could go to bed. She had gotten turned around somewhere, and now she had no idea where she was. She didn't really mind. She had always loved to explore and find new things. What better a place to do it than a castle? She was also glad for the solitude. Aside from the brief time when she was talking with Bragnae, Salomon had been by her side. It was not that she disliked him really, but sometimes she would catch him looking at her in an unnerving way. Suddenly, she got a feeling and the hairs on the back of her neck stood up. She turned swiftly, vainly grappling for the dagger she kept at her belt, only to remember that she had left her belt in her room. Luckily it was only Salomon. She wasn't in any real danger…. Was she? He regarded her with that odd look in his light blue eyes, and it was all she could do to meet his gaze. \"Are you lost, Fallon?\" he asked finally, his deep voice resonating off the walls. Fallon looked away nervously. \"Yes,\" she replied quietly, \"But I was rather enjoying exploring the castle. If that's alright?\" \"No it's perfectly fine,\" he answered, walking closer to her, \"But if you would like someone to show you all the interesting places and explain some things, I'd be happy to accompany you.\" Fallon knew she should refuse him. But when she opened her mouth to tell him politely that she would be fine, these words came out, \"I would like that very much. Thank you.\" She could have banged her head against the hard stone wall. \"Good,\" he said, smiling slowly. His voice was sensual, and despite her furious mental protests, she felt her body heat up and her heartbeat quicken. Why did he affect her so? No man had ever made her heart race like this. Fallon reluctantly took the arm that Salomon offered and began walking with him. He was pleasant as they walked, and it seemed and utter change from how he had been that morning. He hadn't really been rude to her for the most part, but he certainly hadn't been as pleasant or polite as this. She briefly wondered why the change had come about, but soon she was too lost in his rich voice and the feel of his body so close to hers to notice anything. \"And this painting,\" he was saying, gesturing to a lovely picture of a beautiful sunrise on the bank of a river, \"Was a gift from Lord Marke for the Princess Isolde. It is quite beautiful, is it not?\" \"Yes, quite,\" Fallon murmured absently. The painting was beautiful, but Salomon was distracting her. She liked the way his strong jaw looked from the side and the way his firm lips looked as he spoke. She wondered what those lips would feel like on hers. Immediately she tried to push down the thought, but with the brief and fleeting image of him placing his lips firmly on hers, came others. Suddenly she wondered what it would be like for him to make love to her, and in her mind she saw him naked and covered in glistening sweat, moving above her, kissing her whole body. Her cheeks turned crimson at the thought. Unfortunately, it was then that Salomon decided to turn away from the picture and look at her. \"What is it?\" he asked with an amused grin. She blushed even deeper, and her heart raced. \"Nothing,\" she replied breathlessly, but he shook his head. The look on his face had changed from amusement to desire in an instant. His voice was deep and husky as he said, \"No. You were thinking about exactly what I've been thinking about since I first touched your hand today at the stables.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" she protested nervously as she took his arm from hers and began backing away. \"You know exactly what I'm speaking of,\" he persisted with that dangerous lusty look in his eyes. He took a step toward her, and Fallon thought that he had never looked so large or imposing or dangerous. She wondered what part of her was in danger. Her body or her heart? \"Why else is your face as crimson as blood? Why else is your voice so breathless? Why else are your breasts heaving with your heavy breaths?\" Modestly, she brought her hands to her breasts and tried to steady her breathing. His comment had caused her to realize that her breathing was, in fact, threatening to force her breasts out of the tight bodice of her dress. \"Sir!\" she began to berate him, but he spoke over her. \"You're a beautiful woman, Fallon,\" he said as he took another step to her, \"I noticed it right off. When you're this close to me, I have trouble breathing. I want you. Badly. I need you, Fallon.\" And with that, he swiftly closed the distance between them, and before she knew it, Fallon had her back pressed against the wall and was being quite thoroughly kissed. Of their own will, her lips parted and welcomed his exploring tongue. She moaned against his mouth as his tongue gently massaged hers, and her body couldn't help but respond. She grinded her pelvis into his thigh, trying vainly to soothe the growing need in her loins. She felt the hardness of his arousal pressed against her belly. \"Oh, Fallon, Fallon,\" he murmured when he took his mouth from hers only to place it on the sensitive skin of her neck. She whimpered in reply and tangled her fingers in his light hair. One of his hands came up to caress her breast. He massaged lightly causing flames of desire to run all the way up and down her body. But as he reached down for the hem of her dress, a cold wave of realization came over her. This man did not love her. Salomon wanted her body. Nothing more. Maybe he would tire of her after a night, or maybe he would keep her for his pleasure longer, but either way he did not love her. Lord Marke had even mentioned his betrothal to another woman that night when they dined. No, he didn't love her. Not that she loved him. Now that she had control over herself, she realized both of those facts. They weren't in love. Certainly not. No. And she wasn't going to give herself to a man who she didn't love. Anyways, even if she did love him- which she didn't- nothing could ever come for them. He was to be married, and she was a commoner. In the time it took her to think this, Salomon had gotten the hem of her dress up to her thighs and was quickly pushing it farther as his mouth went down searching for her breast. She knew that if she didn't stop him then, then she never would. \"No, milord,\" She used the title, hoping to dispel the closeness that now existed between them. She wanted to seem distant and uninterested. \"Stop. I don't want this.\" He took his mouth away from her breast and looked up at her with a sultry smile as he lightly caressed the tops of her thighs. \"Don't want it? I know….\" She realized that force was the only thing that was going to stop him, and she knew she had to act quickly, for one of his hands was moving up between her legs. She slapped him as hard as she could across the face, so hard that her palm stung. That made him release her and back away with a surprised and angry look on his face. \"Teasing, wench!\" he exclaimed furiously, \"You lead me to believe…!\" \"I led you to believe nothing, Sir!\" she shot back just as angrily. She balled her hands into fists and her small body shook with rage. How dare he accuse her of being a teasing wench! \"I said nothing to encourage your rash actions. You acted of your own will!\" \"And what did you do to stop me before now?\" \"I couldn't do anything sooner! But know that I will be ready next time. Your affections and caresses are not wanted by me.\" That was a lie. \"So I suggest you bestow them elsewhere.\" She tossed her head with an arrogant sniff. She was glad that her face did not seem to betray her lie. \"Oh, trust me, I will,\" he hissed. And she knew that he was seething with wrath. \" You are not worth my time or my affection.\" He whirled around and stalked back down the hall. With an angry growl, she turned and stomped off in the opposite direction. Salomon was still shaking with ire by the time he reached his chamber. The nerve of that woman! He knew she had wanted him at the beginning, and yet she had seemed so vehement in her objections there right before he left her. How could she have changed so quickly? Unfortunately for him, he still desired her. He thought that maybe if he had her once, his lust would be satiated, but how could he ever know that if she wouldn't have him? Her lips had been so soft and sweet. And her breasts! They had fit perfectly in his hand and had tasted wonderful under his mouth. He was still hard and thinking of Fallon like that was not helping. Just as he picked up the pitcher of cold water that sat on his table and was about to pour it over him, a knock came at the door. He cursed softly then called out, \"Enter.\" The door opened, and to Salomon's immense surprise in walked his cousin, Lord Marke. Immediately, Salomon bowed. \"I was not expecting you at this time, milord. Please sit.\" He led Marke to his most comfortable chair. When he had gotten himself situated in the chair, Marke said, \"Let us not be formal, Salomon. When we are alone, I am Marke. I came here to speak not as King, but as a man.\" \"Yes, mi… I mean Marke. What is it?\" Salomon wondered what could be important enough for Marke to come to his chamber so late. Marke sighed. \"I came to speak to you of that young woman who dined with us tonight. Fallon.\" Salomon wince inwardly, but he tried not to let it show. What exactly did Marke know? \"What of her? She is….\" \"You have seen her recently, have you not? Moments ago?\" Marke was irritatingly wise and perceptive. Salomon could have growled in annoyance, but he restrained himself. \"Yes, but what…?\" \"I can see it in your face. Your skin is flushed, and your breathing has not yet steadied totally. I also saw the way you looked at her tonight. And I want you to know that you cannot act of this desire, Salomon.\" Salomon resisted the urge to deny, and instead said, \"And why is that?\" \"Because you are betrothed to another. You have promised to marry another woman.\" Gwen. Salomon groaned aloud. He had met Gwen ferch Cynyr but once, and she was a pretty woman and seemed pleasant enough. But there hadn't been the attraction there that he now felt for Fallon. He was drawn to this mysterious raven-haired maiden more than he had been to any woman. He was so consumed with need for her that until now, he had totally forgotten about his impending marriage. He wished fleetingly that Fallon instead of Gwen could be his wife, but he immediately pushed the thought away. Gwen was royalty born and a proper woman for a king's wife. Fallon was not. Finally he said, \"But many men take mistresses. And I am not even married to Gwen yet.\" Mark shook his head. \"Salomon, I know you. You have always been a passionate person, and whatever you care for you will not let go of without a fight. This woman would grow to be more than a mistress to you, and you would not be able to let her go. But you must marry Gwen.\" \"I could let her go,\" Salomon protested sullenly, \"I know I could. I just… want her. Have you never wanted a woman, Cousin? Desired her so badly that it hurt?\" A nostalgic look came over the older man's eyes, but it quickly vanished and turned to firmness. \"I know what you desire, but my command stands you will not act on this. Now I do speak as king. You must not. In a week's time Gwen will be here at Cornwall, and you will be married. You can wait that long and then your desires can be fulfilled, but not with Fallon. Never with Fallon. Gwen ferch Cynyr is your destiny.\" Marke yawned. \"I grow tired. My health is failing me, Salomon. I am not the man I once was, and you will soon have to take my place as King of Cornwall. Take that place with a respectable wife and family. Do this for me.\" And then Marke left Salomon alone. He undressed and lay down in his bed. His mind was torn. He loved Marke. He was his kinsman, and he was loyal to him. He should not go against his wishes. And yet, he was on fire for Fallon! His whole body cried out for her. He needed her. He tossed and turned in bed thinking of what it would be like to lay with her. He knew it would be amazing. But Marke was right. He had to marry Gwen. But other men took mistresses, and he could let go of Fallon if he wanted to…. Maybe. He hit his pillow and growled in frustration. This was going to be a sleepless night.[Chapter 5] Acknowledging Attraction The next morning, the drizzle of the day before finally broke into a violent storm. And Fallon sat on the edge of the bed in the guest room she had been given, watching it rage in the dim dawn hours. She hadn't gotten much sleep at all the night before. Thoughts of Salomon had kept her up, tossing and turning in the bed. She knew that nothing good would have come of letting him bed her, and yet, his lips had felt so good… so right. She sighed and curled up on her side, still staring vacantly out the window. Well, there was no way she could leave today. The storm was too bad for any traveling to take place. So unlike what she had hoped for, she could not simply slip out of the castle unnoticed. She would have to face Salomon again today. She wondered what it would be like to see him again. Would he be cruel to her? Would he try to pretend that nothing had happened? That would probably be for the best. In any case, she knew that meeting him again would be awkward. She should have just stayed home where she belonged. A knock came at her door and without waiting to be admitted, Bragnae walked in. \"I wasn't sure if you'd be up yet or not,\" she said as she looked at Fallon laying motionlessly on the big bed, \"Good morning, lass.\" Last night before the dinner, Fallon and Bragnae had talked for a long time, both about Fallon and the mother that she never knew. The old woman seemed glad to reminisce and tell Fallon a lot about Isolde. It surprised Fallon, but she already felt herself warming up to Bragnae. She was happy to have her company on this gloomy morning. \"Good morning, Bragnae,\" she mumbled as she sat up again. Bragnae's brow creased in suspicion, and she scrutinized Fallon's face with her wise old eyes a moment before saying. \"What's happened?\" Fallon's eyes widened in surprise. \"How…?\" she began with wonder, but she quickly checked herself. \"Nothing,\" she finished. Bragnae barked a short laugh. \"I've lived long enough to know something's wrong when people have their emotions written on their faces. You don't seem to be too good at hiding things. Now, what is it? Don't deny that something is wrong. I know.\" Fallon huffed and rolled onto her other side so she would not have to meet Bragnae's knowing eyes. \"I do not wish to talk about it.\" Bragnae sighed and began to straighten things about the room, all the while making small talk to fill the silence. Fallon grunted periodically to show that she was not asleep. After a few moments, Bragnae came back and sat down on the bed beside her. \"You remind me of your mother,\" she said quietly. Fallon smiled sadly. Bragnae had told her that what seemed like a thousand times the night before. It was obvious that she missed her former charge. Fallon wished she could have known her mother. \"The way you act, your beauty, your whole manner,\" the aging woman continued, \"She used to confide in me, you know. You could do the same.\" Fallon rolled back towards her. \"It's really not important,\" she said finally. Bragnae shrugged. \"Maybe not, but that doesn't change the fact that it's bothering you.\" Fallon had to agree with that. She sighed again. \"It doesn't matter. Honestly.\" \"It is about the young Lord Salomon, is it not?\" Fallon gaped at her. How did the woman know so bloody much? Fallon mentally berated herself for being all to obvious. She wiped the stunned look of her face. \"Of course not,\" she lied, \"Why would he be of any importance to me?\" Bragnae shrugged and absently picked at a loose thread on the sheets. \"I don't know…. Maybe because he is young and handsome and has obviously been admiring you since you two met yesterday morning.\" Fallon blushed. \"I have no idea what you are talking about.\" \"Don't try to lie to me,\" Bragnae warned, \"I will always no. Your mother found that out. When I brought out the wine at dinner last night, I saw the way he looked at you. And then later when I came to inquire if you needed anything last night, you had just gotten in your room. Your cheeks were flushed- much like they are now- and you wouldn't let me get two words in. You practically slammed the door in my face. I may be old, but I'm not a dolt.\" No, she's certainly far from that, Fallon thought with a surge of irritation. \"I was tired, and I wanted to get to bed. My actions last night had nothing to do with Lord Salomon,\" she lied. Bragnae snorted her disbelief. \"I'm sure,\" she said with sarcasm. Then after a pause, she added with a little more compassion, \"I was young once, and though I never was as beautiful as you or your mother, I had my share of suitors in my youth. I know what it's like to desire and be desired.\" Fallon blushed again, her face turning a bright shade of crimson all the way up to her raven locks. \"I do not desire him!\" she exclaimed with indignation, \"And he most certainly does not desire me!\" Her blush deepened as images of their brief passion play the night before appeared in her mind. If Bragnae had seen that then there would be no denying how she desired Salomon, but luckily Fallon knew that no one had been near them. Bragnae chortled. \"Oh, and I suppose you were all hot and bothered last night for nothing?\" If at all possible, Fallon's cheeks turned even brighter. \"I was not …!\" she began heatedly, but she cut off with a growl, realizing that arguing would get her nowhere. It had become clear that there would be no deceiving Bragnae. \"Oh! I just don't want to discuss it!\" She felt like yelling at her, telling her that she had no business talking to her so personally… but she couldn't. For some reason, Fallon felt a kinship with the older woman. Probably because of her close ties with her mother. It seemed natural to talk like this with Bragnae. After a moment of silence, she sighed in resignation then said softly, \"I don't even know him.\" Bragnae shrugged. \"But who's to say how long it takes for two people to develop an attraction? Maybe it's something that will vanish as quickly as it appeared.\" She met Fallon's eyes. \"But maybe not.\" Fallon held her gaze and found herself wondering about Bragnae's past. There seemed to be some emotional ties with what she was telling Fallon. But whether there was something like this in Bragnae's past or not, Fallon did not want to delve into it right then. She had enough on her mind. All that she could seem to think about were Salomon's insistent lips on hers and his hands urgently massaging her breasts. She could have moaned aloud at the need the memory stirred. He had awaked foreign feelings in her soul and body. Desires and needs that she knew that only he could satisfy. \"It doesn't matter,\" she said finally, the gloom in her voice fitting in perfectly with the weather, \"He is nobly born, and I am not.\" She spoke both to herself and Bragnae. \"Ah, but you forget, my dear,\" Bragnae said as she lifted her eyebrows, \"You are indeed nobly born. Maybe not nobly raised, but nobility is in your blood.\" Fallon sat up straighter and looked at Bragnae with alarm. \"You won't tell anyone will you? I don't want them to know. I just wanted to see where my mother and father lived, and then I was to be on my way. I am leaving as soon as this storm lets up.\" And that could not happen soon enough. Bragnae's wrinkled face sagged in what Fallon took for as disappointment. \"Of course I won't if you do not wish it, but…. Well, I was hoping you might choose to stay for a little while.\" She looked away towards the window where the storm was still raging. \"It's just that I was so close to your mother,\" she continued in a soft voice, \"She was the only thing I had for so long, and then when she disappeared. It's been rather lonely these years…. But then when I saw you yesterday, I thought maybe…. But if you must go, then you must go.\" Fallon felt her resolve to be away from Castle Dor dissolving as she realized just how alone Bragnae must have felt for the past 16 years. She had devoted most of her life to catering to her mother. Fallon sighed, \"Well,\" she said with a shrug, \"I suppose a few days here wouldn't be too bad.\" She didn't know how much truth there was in that last statement. A few more days around Salomon could prove to be very very bad indeed. Bragnae smiled a slightly sad smile of thanks. \"I appreciate you indulging an old woman in her few pleasures. Know that anything you would like to know of your mother, I will gladly tell you.\" She sighed in frustration and began moving to the door. \"But now I have some duties to attend to. I will come to you later tonight though, after dinner.\" When she was about half way to the door she paused. \"Wait a moment. I'll be right back.\" And before Fallon could question what she was doing, Bragnae was out the door. True to her word, only moments later, Bragnae returned. In her arms she carried a trunk. It wasn't a large trunk, but she was panting with the toll it took on her aging body so Fallon bounded from her seat at the bed to help her. They sat it down on the floor and Fallon asked, \"What's this?\" Bragnae kneeled and open the trunk. Inside were fine, neatly folded, dresses. Fallon gasped at the sheer beauty and elegance of the garments. She had never owned any clothing half so marvelous as these. \"They belonged to your mother,\" Bragnae told her. Fallon's eyes widened as Bragnae pulled out the most beautiful dress she had ever seen in her life. It was made of flowing ruby red silk and had a gold flower pattern traveling up from the bottom hem to the hip. The neckline was cut in a low V. She reached out and felt the soft fabric. It was certainly a dress befitting a queen. Bragnae thrust it out to her. \"Put it on.\" Fallon gaped. \"I couldn't!\" \"It was your mother's. Since she is no longer with us, it is rightfully yours. Of course you could.\" \"But won't Lord Marke notice….\" \"Lord Mark is nearly as old as I am. He will not remember a dress that Isolde wore 16 years ago. Here. I'll help you.\" Fallon hadn't dressed that morning and was only wearing her thin cotton shift. She took the lovely red dress from Bragnae's hands carefully. She stepped into it, pulled it up, stuck her arms into the sleeves, and then turned for Bragnae to do up the laces. Bragnae performed the task with skill, if not gentleness. A few times, she jerked the laces of the bodice so tight that Fallon gasped for breath. When she finished, she moved Fallon over to a full sized mirror so she could see herself. \"My, my,\" was all Bragnae said as Fallon stared at the woman in the mirror, hardly believing that it was her. She looked beautiful and regal. The neckline swooped down, revealing a tantalizing amount of ivory bosom and pale shoulders. The long sleeves flowed down until they just barely showed the tips of her slender fingers. The red silk sheathed her lush curves perfectly. \"Bragnae,\" she breathed, \"It's beautiful!\" Bragnae nodded. \"That it is, child. You look like royalty now. You look even more like your mother.\" Fallon still could not tear her gaze from her reflection. It seemed as if she didn't even know the woman staring back at her. \"Here,\" Bragnae said after a moment. She reached for a brush. \"Let me brush your hair.\" Fallon waited patiently as Bragnae quickly and deftly worked through the few tangles in her raven black locks. When she was finished, the dark hair flowed in soft curls down to her mid back and over her partially exposed shoulders. Fallon couldn't help but steal another look at her reflection. She did look beautiful. Her eyes wondered down her body, and the only thought that came unbidden to her mind was: Salomon's blood will boil when he sees me in this! She blushed. Salomon was practicing swords with another young noble staying at Castle Dor. Since the storm was raging outside, they battled in one of the large banquet rooms rather than the courtyard. He brought his wooden blade down on the other young man's mercilessly. Sweat glistened on his bare chest, and he was panting. He always put his best effort into practicing the arts of war, but this afternoon he had worked even harder than he usually did. He was frustrated. Frustrated by his pending marriage and frustrated even more by his unceasing desire for Fallon. He had laid awake most of the night wishing she were there in the bed with him. He did a lot of thinking also. And as he though near the early morning hours before dawn, he came to a revelation. His desire for Fallon was not only for her body, but also for her spirit, her soul. He found it odd, outrageous even, but for some reason it seemed as if he had known her forever, as if they were made for each other. It was absurd he knew, but he simply could not banish the thought. He happened to glance away from his opponent for an instant and what he saw made his breath catch in his throat. Fallon was strolling aimlessly a little ways away. She paused and began to examine an old vase, lightly tracing the carvings in it with her slim delicate fingers. She looked amazingly beautiful. Her long midnight black hair cascaded down her back and bare shoulders. The beautiful red silk dress she was wearing fit her like her was sure no other dress could. Her already tempting shape looked even more alluring. He barely bit back a groan of need as he looked at her perfectly formed breasts and bottom. She was…. \"Umph!\" The wind was knocked out of him, and clutching his side where his practice partner's sword had made contact, he fell to the ground. He growled in frustration. Damn the woman for being able to distract him so! He ground his teeth against the sharp pain as he felt around making sure that none of his ribs had been fractured. He directed a piercing glare at the other man as he pushed himself to his feet. Finally he forced himself to say, \"Good hit,\" in acknowledgement to the young man's win. He wouldn't have been able to win if not for Fallon. He turned and stalked off, leaving his sword partner and the other men who had gathered there, toward where she was standing, still innocently examining the vase, unaware of the commotion she had caused. When she finally looked up just as Salomon was nearing her. A startled and somewhat frightened look came to her face. She turned without so much as a nod of acknowledgment and began to briskly walk away. But Salomon would have none of it. He quickened his pace and followed her. She looked over her shoulder and must have seen the anger in his eyes for her pace became even faster. She walked and he followed her for a few moments, but since she was unfamiliar with the castle halls, she walked herself right into a dead end. \"Is there something I can help you with, milord?\" she asked icily as she folded her arms beneath her breasts. Salomon angrily opened his mouth, but then he realized he didn't know what to say. He couldn't really yell at her for distracting him just by her mere presence. So instead of speaking he just gazed at her and she at him. He noted with a hint of triumph that her eyes lingered for a long while on the gleaming muscles of his chest and abdomen. He let his eyes wander lazily down her form. He loved the way her ample bosom tapered down to her slim waist and then her lovely hips. He could just see the outline of her shapely legs through the thin material of the dress. His breathing quickened of its own accord. He knew he had to say something soon or they would be in just the same position that they were in the night before. \"That… that is a… umm… lovely dress,\" he finally managed, bringing his gaze back up to her emerald eyes. She blushed scarlet. Then said, \"And did you follow me here with that lethal look in your eyes just to tell me that?\" Anger flashed in her eyes, and thunder rumbled loudly outside. Salomon sighed. \"I want to apologize to you, Fallon.\" He had to force the words out. Growing up as a prince, he wasn't used to having to apologize. \"For… erm… last night.\" He cleared his throat nervously. She blushed again. She opened and closed her mouth a few times, searching for words, finally she managed, \"I accept your apology.\" After she said the words, she looked as if she had eaten something sour. Salomon could tell that she didn't care much for apologies and the like either. Salomon stared down at the floor awkwardly, studying the patterns etched in the stone so he would have an excuse not to stare at the beautiful young woman standing in front of him. Finally, she voiced the exact thought that was on his mind. \"But how are we going to prevent it from happening again?\" she asked quietly. At last, Salomon looked up into her eyes. \"I have no idea, Fallon. I don't know if we can.\" Okay so end of chapter 5. What did you guys think? I'm having a little trouble trying to keep Bragnae in character because she wasn't really a huge part of the movie and it's been awhile since I've seen it anyways so it's hard for me to remember what she's like exactly. I may give her a little back story in one of the future chapters I'm not sure though. I also plan to bring in Salomon's betrothed, Gwen, in the next chapter so things should get a bit interesting… ;) Anyways please please please review![Chapter 6] Emotions Rage It had been a little over two weeks since Fallon had first arrived with Salomon at Castle Dor. Due to the pleading of Bragnae, Lord Marke had offered her a job as a serving maid. Having nowhere else to go, Fallon accepted. Since the first two days of her arrival and stay at the castle, she had avoided Salomon like the plague. Now that she was one of the maids, she did not dine with Lord Marke and the other nobles, so she did not have to worry about running into him at her meals. And throughout the day, if she saw him near, she would run down the nearest corridor, not caring where it went just wanting to stay away from him. The words he had said when she asked him how they were going to prevent something happening between them again played over and over again in her mind. \"I don't know if we can.\" She didn't know if they could either. That was why she avoided him. But every time she saw him, just before she found some place to hide, a fleeting part of her wanted to run to him and throw herself into his arms. She wanted to tell him how foolish she had been for making him stop that first night. She wanted to beg him to take her to his rooms and make love to her again and again. But then cold reason would wash over her, and she would know that she couldn't do that. That they could never be. Fallon forced herself to rise from her bed. She looked longingly at the trunk that rested in the corner of the small bed chamber. Her mother's dresses were in there. She wished she could put one of them on. They made her feel so beautiful, so elegant. But maids didn't wear that sort of thing. Instead, she reached for her drab brown servant's frock. Two weeks ago, before she had ever left her small country home, the dress would have seemed normal, maybe even better, but after having spent a few days in the beautiful silk gowns of her mother, they seemed like rags. She looked at herself in the mirror as she laced up the bodice, unlike her mother's gowns this one laced in the front. She did have to admit that it flattered her plump breasts. Salomon had certainly stared the other day. She blushed and mentally berated herself. Why was it that every time she got dressed in the morning, she thought about what he would think? With only a single knock as warning, Bragnae rushed into the room in a whirlwind. Fallon turned from the mirror, and regarded a panting Bragnae with a raised eyebrow. \"Fallon,\" she huffed without even giving Fallon the chance to speak, \"You must come quickly. You are needed.\" \"Good morning to you too, Bragnae,\" Fallon mumbled as she pulled her long black hair over her shoulder and began to tie it back into a braid. \"Tell me what I am needed for while I attempt to finish this.\" Bragnae sighed exasperatedly. \"Hurry, hurry!\" she commanded, \"We need to go make ready the Lady Gwen's bed chamber.\" Fallon turned to Bragnae with a scowl. Her relatively good mood had disappeared upon hearing that name. \"I thought she wasn't arriving for another two days at least,\" she mumbled sullenly. \"That's what we all thought,\" Bragnae replied, unaware of Fallon's swift change of mood, \"But Lord Marke has just informed me that she and her father and their escorts have been spotted and should be arriving before noon. We don't have much time to prepare. Hurry!\" Fallon quickly tied off her long braid and followed Bragnae out of the room. She walked close on Bragnae's heels, her anger growing hotter as they neared Lady Gwen's room. She was angry with Gwen ferch Cynyr for arriving, angry with Salomon for marrying her, and angry with herself for being angry. They spent the whole morning readying the lady's chamber. Fallon wished she had a snake or some bugs on hand to put in Gwen's bed. She would take much satisfaction to her Lady Gwen scream in terror and revulsion. She knew that she shouldn't be jealous. She shouldn't care. She had known from the beginning that Salomon could never love her, much less marry her. She had known he was to marry Gwen. She knew it was for the best. Then why was it that when she heard the trumpets sound, announcing the arrival of the Lady Gwen and her father, that tears of hurt filled her emerald eyes. Bragnae came to stand beside her at the window that looked out at the front of the castle grounds. Fallon watched as a young woman with long curled golden-red hair dismounted her sleek white horse. She could tell even from that view that the woman was beautiful. Beauty and wealth? Certainly nothing she could hope to compete with. A small tear trickled down her cheek. Bragnae looked at her as she tucked strands of gray hair back into her bun. She followed Fallon's gaze down to Gwen ferch Cynyr. \"Fallon,\" she said softly, \"You knew this would happen.\" Fallon laughed mirthlessly. \"That's what I've been telling myself all morning.\" \"You mustn't do this,\" Bragnae persisted, \"I won't have you ending up like your mother.\" \"You need not advise me, Bragnae,\" Fallon said bitterly, \"Nothing will come of this. Lord Salomon will marry Lady Gwen. I will play no part in it.\" Bragnae regarded her for a long time. \"You know it is not that simple,\" she said finally. \"Why would it not be simple?\" she asked, becoming angry, \"He doesn't want me ! He wants her ! Well he'll have her! What's not simple about that?\" Bragnae drew her into her arms as she was succumbed to childish sobbing. To her embarrassment, she blubbered like a babe in the older woman's arms for far too long. Why did she ever leave her home? None of this would have happened if she had just been content to stay put. Why couldn't she have been happy where she was? Salomon sat to the left of Marke and across from his betrothed, Gwen, that evening at supper. He was a lucky man. At least he wasn't to be joined with an ugly or repulsive woman. No, Gwen was very desirable. She had long flowing golden-red hair, sparkling blue eyes, an attractive figure. What more could a man ask for? But she's not Fallon, reminded a small voice in his mind. He shook his head slightly, vainly trying to silence the voice. That doesn't matter, he insisted, She doesn't matter to me. But he knew as soon as he thought it that that was most definitely a lie. Fallon mattered a great deal to him. For a reason inexplicable to him, he felt as if he belonged with Fallon, that they had always belonged together. Every time he looked at her, every time he thought about her voice, every time he thought about her smile, his heart felt as though it would burst. He thought, despite having only known her for a short time, that he was falling in love with her. That notion was reinforced by the fact that although Gwen was a pretty and desirable enough woman every time he looked at her he felt like he wanted to throw up. Every time he looked at her and saw her light hair and blue eyes he wanted to run from the room. He wanted to run from the room and find the enchanting maid with dark hair and green eyes who had stolen his heart. He remembered that it would seem impolite if he didn't at least speak to Gwen. \"Are you very tired from your journey, Lady Gwen?\" he asked out of politeness. His thoughts were elsewhere. \"No, not very, milord,\" she replied in a soft timid voice. She was nothing like Fallon. Fallon was strong and brave. She had been defiant and outspoken to him even after she found that he was a noble. Gwen, a noble herself, was weak and soft spoken. He didn't know how he would be able to live with her. \"That is well,\" Marke cut in when an awkward silence descended on the table, \"Your wedding will take place in two nights. I trust you are ready.\" Gwen's father, Lord Cynyr Ceinfarfog answered for her. \"Yes, Marke,\" he said in his gruff voice, \"She is ready. If she's anything like her mother, she'll bear strong children. Your cousin is lucky to have her.\" \"Most certainly,\" Marke responded. Then the door opened and Fallon walked in carrying another basket of rolls. Salomon willed desperately for her to look at him. He wanted to speak to her, to look into her eyes. But, like she had been of late, she avoided meeting his gaze. \"Wench!\" Lord Ceinfarfog called just as she was about to exit the room, \"More wine.\" \"Yes, milord,\" Fallon said as she retrieved the wine pitcher. She obediently walked over to him and filled his cup full. As she was turning to walk away, he reached out with one of his meaty hands and pinched her bottom. For an instant, Salomon saw anger and indignation flare in her eyes, but she quelled her emotions and walked away without a word. Salomon started up from the table, fixing Lord Ceinfarfog with furious glare. His mouth was open ready to pour forth a tirade of wrath, but he felt Marke's hand on his knee under the table, trying to restrain him. Salomon looked to his cousin's eyes and red what the older man was thinking: Don't let your heart get ahead of your sense. Salomon gritted his teeth against the rage and tried to calm himself, but the image of the grubby old man's hand on Fallon kept forcing its way into his mind. He kept his silence through the meal, sullenly staring down at his food. He knew that if he looked at his soon-to-be father-in-law too much, he might explode. Later that night, Salomon bid goodnight to Marke, Lord Ceinfarfog, and his betrothed and went desperately searching for Fallon. He had to at least see her. He wanted to tell her of the revelation that he had had, that he loved her, but he didn't know if he should. What good could come of it? Maybe she didn't even return the sentiment. And even if she did, he still had to marry Gwen….. But still, he wanted her to know. He raced up and down the long corridors. Every time he saw a woman in the castle's maids livery, his breath caught in his throat and his heart leapt, but then she would turn and it wouldn't be Fallon, and he would begin his search again. It was getting late, and he almost considered giving up, but as he rounded the nest corner, he saw another maid. His heart didn't race for he knew this could not be Fallon. This woman's hair was iron gray and pulled back into a bun. It was Bragnae. \"Bragnae!\" he called as she began to walk away. She turned back to him with a look of surprise. \"Yes, milord?\" \"Bragnae,\" he replied out of breath from all the running he had been doing, \"I'm looking for Fallon. Do you know where she is?\" Bragnae bit her lip, and her wrinkles deepened as she creased her forehead in indecision. \"I don't know if I should do that, milord. I…\" \"What do you mean you shouldn't do that?\" Salomon shouted angrily, \"I am to be King of Cornwall when my cousin passes. You owe me respect! Now, where is she?\" Bragnae regarded him warily. \"Milord, forgive me, but may I speak freely?\" Salomon gritted his teeth in anger, but he reminded himself that Bragnae was not the cause of his frustration. He let out his breath slowly, trying to calm himself. \"Yes, Bragnae. What would you like to say?\" She took a deep breath. \"I care deeply for Fallon. She reminds me of….\" A nostalgic look came into her old eyes, but she shook her head and returned to the present. \"Someone. I love her like a daughter. The last thing I want is for her to get hurt. Do you take my meaning, Sir?\" Salomon stared at her sadly for a moment. \"Yes, but….\" He trailed off. He didn't want to stand there and pour his heart out to one of the maids. \"I don't want to hurt her,\" he finished. \"I know you don't,\" she replied, \"But just because you don't want her to hurt doesn't mean she won't.\" \"Will you please just tell me where she is?\" he pleaded, \"I need to see her.\" Bragnae sighed. \"Nothing good will come of this,\" she muttered under her breath. Then louder, \"She is finished with her duties for the night. She just went out to the garden. She said she would be there for a while, so you shouldn't miss her.\" \"Thank you!\" Salomon called over his shoulder as he turned and ran towards the garden. When he got outside, he had to pause and take a deep breath of fresh air. It was such a lovely night. A wonderful night to be out strolling the gardens with Fallon. He looked up and saw that there wasn't a cloud in the sky. The stars twinkled down on him. He took another deep breath, and prayed that Fallon wouldn't try to get away from him tonight. He found her sitting on a bench staring up at the beautiful sky. She had undone her braid, and her raven locks fell in waves over her milk-white shoulders and down her back. He longed to walk behind her and run his hands through that beautiful hair, but he restrained himself. Instead he went and sat down beside her. She gave a startled jump and then moved as if to leave. But Salomon caught her hand and said in a soft voice, \"Please stay, Fallon.\" To his pleasure, she relaxed back down onto the bench. When she tried to pull her hand away, he held onto it and brought it up to his lips. He gently kissed it. Fallon blinked at him in bewilderment. \"You… you know we cannot do this,\" she said sadly. \"And why can't we?\" he asked, even though he knew the answer all too well. He placed another kiss on her hand. This one was more passionate, more needy. \"You are to be married,\" she whispered. He looked into her emerald eyes. They were wide and shining with unshed tears. \"But I'm not married yet,\" he protested as he held her gaze. \"But you will be!\" she argued hotly, wrenching her hand from his grasp and standing up, \"And then what? Then I'll just be some woman you come to when you tire of your wife! I will not be your mistress, Salomon!\" Salomon stood up, still looking at her. \"But don't realize,\" he entreated, \"That you already mean more to me than any mistress ever could? Don't you realize you mean more to me than… her?\" He couldn't even bring himself to say his betrothed's name. A big tear rolled down Fallon's cheek. \"Don't play games with me, Salomon,\" she said softly, \"You proved very well what you wanted from me on the first night I was here.\" Salomon couldn't suppress his groan. He wished that he had never let himself get so out of control that night. He didn't want her to think that he only wanted her for a bedmate. \"Fallon,\" he said, taking a step closer to her, \"I already apologized for that…. I was thinking. Of course I want you in that way, Fallon. But please believe when I say I want much much more from you.\" She was crying openly now. \"More that I can't give, Salomon!\" she sobbed, \"You're a promised man!\" Salomon enfolded her in his arms and held her tightly to his chest, wondering how he managed to keep from crying himself. He ran his hands over her silky tresses and down her back as he murmured soothing words to persuade her to stop crying. When at last, her sobs had dwindled down to soft whimpers and sighs, he whispered, \"I love you, Fallon.\" She liked up at him then. Her lip quivered and he wanted nothing more than to kiss her senseless, but he waited for her reply. \"Oh, I love you,\" she moaned, \"God forgive me, I love you.\" Then he kissed her. In that moment when his lips were pressed to hers, he was in heaven. It wasn't like the first kiss they had shared, not a wholly sexual, lusty kiss. This was a kiss of passionate love. Neither of them was holding anything back. Neither of them was putting up any resistance. Salomon held her against him with one arm, and he held her head tilted up to his with one of his big hands. He murmured her name against her mouth as he traced her high elegant cheekbone with his thumb. He loved the feel of her soft lips against his. He loved the taste of her mouth. They parted some time later. Fallon rested her head against his chest and wrapped her arms around his waist as she recovered her breath. \"What are we going to do?\" she asked him softly. Salomon stroked her hair silently for a moment before replying, \"I wish I knew.\" She nodded and pulled away. \"I must go,\" she said, \"Bragnae will certainly be waiting to see when I retire.\" She hesitated a moment. \"When can I see you again? I mean, like this, alone.\" Salomon's spirits soared at her words. He was so happy that she was willing to be with him despite everything. \"Tomorrow night,\" he replied hurriedly, \"And the night after that. My next two nights are yours.\" The statement that after that time, his nights would be Gwen's hung unspoken between them. She nodded and smiled sadly. \"I love you,\" she said softly then turned and quickly ran out of the garden. \"I love you, Fallon!\" he called after her. He turned back and sat on the bench with is head in his hands, not yet ready to retire to his rooms. Neither of them had seen the third person watching them from behind some nearby bushes. Gwen ferch Cynyr stormed back to her chamber furiously. The little scene she had just witnessed in the garden played over and over again in her mind, enraging her. How could this be happening? Here she was, trying to make the best out of an unwanted marriage, and her husband-to-be was already running to the arms of some other woman! And not even a noblewoman! A serving wench! The whole situation was preposterous to her. She was so angry that when she got to her room, she slammed open the door, and it rebounded from the wall with a thundering boom. Rowena, her personal lady's maid, who had been sitting on the edge of Gwen's bed, jumped so high that she nearly fell to the floor. Gwen didn't so much as utter one word of apology. \"The nerve of that pig!\" she exclaimed as she through herself down beside Rowena, \"How dare he do this to me?\" \"What is it, milady?\" Rowena asked in her timid voice. Rowena was her own age and had been her friend as well as her servant for many years, so Gwen did not mind speaking of personal matters with her. \"Lord Salomon,\" she said through gritted teeth, investing buckets of scorn into the title, \"Is tumbling one of the serving wenches.\" She didn't actually know if he was bedding her or not; she hadn't been able to hear all of their conversation. But she had heard enough. Rowena gave a small giggle. Gwen barely kept herself from smacking the other woman silly. \"Forgive me, milady,\" she said, \"But that is not so bad. Most men have mistresses. 'Tis a known fact.\" \"I know that,\" Gwen growled, \"But he told her he loved her. That I cannot abide!\" \"Well,\" Rowena reasoned, \"He is young, and he is probably bewildered by this arranged marriage. He is probably just turning to this servant for comfort. He doesn't know what he's saying. You just wait after we're married. You're a beautiful woman. He'll want no one else after he has you.\" Gwen snorted. \"You obviously understand nothing of men, Rowena. They want what they can't have no matter how good what they do have is.\" \"Well, you are much smarter than me, Miss. What are you going to do?\" Gwen thought for a moment. Then she decided on a plan of action. \"I'm going to make that little wench regret ever looking higher than her station,\" she said, more to herself than to Rowena. Then louder, looking to her maid, she said, \"Make sure that a young maid named Fallon attends me as often as you can, Rowena. I will quell this little relationship before it gets too far.\" How did you guys like it? I was going to do a little more, but I figured I would save it for the next chapter. I'll try to update as soon as possible. Please please please review and tell me what you think. Sorry if there are any typos and such, I checked, but it was like 3 in the morning when I finished this so I might have missed something. Thank you for all the nice reviews! I appreciate them greatly. Emotions Rage It had been a little over two weeks since Fallon had first arrived with Salomon at Castle Dor. Due to the pleading of Bragnae, Lord Marke had offered her a job as a serving maid. Having nowhere else to go, Fallon accepted. Since the first two days of her arrival and stay at the castle, she had avoided Salomon like the plague. Now that she was one of the maids, she did not dine with Lord Marke and the other nobles, so she did not have to worry about running into him at her meals. And throughout the day, if she saw him near, she would run down the nearest corridor, not caring where it went just wanting to stay away from him. The words he had said when she asked him how they were going to prevent something happening between them again played over and over again in her mind. \"I don't know if we can.\" She didn't know if they could either. That was why she avoided him. But every time she saw him, just before she found some place to hide, a fleeting part of her wanted to run to him and throw herself into his arms. She wanted to tell him how foolish she had been for making him stop that first night. She wanted to beg him to take her to his rooms and make love to her again and again. But then cold reason would wash over her, and she would know that she couldn't do that. That they could never be. Fallon forced herself to rise from her bed. She looked longingly at the trunk that rested in the corner of the small bed chamber. Her mother's dresses were in there. She wished she could put one of them on. They made her feel so beautiful, so elegant. But maids didn't wear that sort of thing. Instead, she reached for her drab brown servant's frock. Two weeks ago, before she had ever left her small country home, the dress would have seemed normal, maybe even better, but after having spent a few days in the beautiful silk gowns of her mother, they seemed like rags. She looked at herself in the mirror as she laced up the bodice, unlike her mother's gowns this one laced in the front. She did have to admit that it flattered her plump breasts. Salomon had certainly stared the other day. She blushed and mentally berated herself. Why was it that every time she got dressed in the morning, she thought about what he would think? With only a single knock as warning, Bragnae rushed into the room in a whirlwind. Fallon turned from the mirror, and regarded a panting Bragnae with a raised eyebrow. \"Fallon,\" she huffed without even giving Fallon the chance to speak, \"You must come quickly. You are needed.\" \"Good morning to you too, Bragnae,\" Fallon mumbled as she pulled her long black hair over her shoulder and began to tie it back into a braid. \"Tell me what I am needed for while I attempt to finish this.\" Bragnae sighed exasperatedly. \"Hurry, hurry!\" she commanded, \"We need to go make ready the Lady Gwen's bed chamber.\" Fallon turned to Bragnae with a scowl. Her relatively good mood had disappeared upon hearing that name. \"I thought she wasn't arriving for another two days at least,\" she mumbled sullenly. \"That's what we all thought,\" Bragnae replied, unaware of Fallon's swift change of mood, \"But Lord Marke has just informed me that she and her father and their escorts have been spotted and should be arriving before noon. We don't have much time to prepare. Hurry!\" Fallon quickly tied off her long braid and followed Bragnae out of the room. She walked close on Bragnae's heels, her anger growing hotter as they neared Lady Gwen's room. She was angry with Gwen ferch Cynyr for arriving, angry with Salomon for marrying her, and angry with herself for being angry. They spent the whole morning readying the lady's chamber. Fallon wished she had a snake or some bugs on hand to put in Gwen's bed. She would take much satisfaction to her Lady Gwen scream in terror and revulsion. She knew that she shouldn't be jealous. She shouldn't care. She had known from the beginning that Salomon could never love her, much less marry her. She had known he was to marry Gwen. She knew it was for the best. Then why was it that when she heard the trumpets sound, announcing the arrival of the Lady Gwen and her father, that tears of hurt filled her emerald eyes. Bragnae came to stand beside her at the window that looked out at the front of the castle grounds. Fallon watched as a young woman with long curled golden-red hair dismounted her sleek white horse. She could tell even from that view that the woman was beautiful. Beauty and wealth? Certainly nothing she could hope to compete with. A small tear trickled down her cheek. Bragnae looked at her as she tucked strands of gray hair back into her bun. She followed Fallon's gaze down to Gwen ferch Cynyr. \"Fallon,\" she said softly, \"You knew this would happen.\" Fallon laughed mirthlessly. \"That's what I've been telling myself all morning.\" \"You mustn't do this,\" Bragnae persisted, \"I won't have you ending up like your mother.\" \"You need not advise me, Bragnae,\" Fallon said bitterly, \"Nothing will come of this. Lord Salomon will marry Lady Gwen. I will play no part in it.\" Bragnae regarded her for a long time. \"You know it is not that simple,\" she said finally. \"Why would it not be simple?\" she asked, becoming angry, \"He doesn't want me ! He wants her ! Well he'll have her! What's not simple about that?\" Bragnae drew her into her arms as she was succumbed to childish sobbing. To her embarrassment, she blubbered like a babe in the older woman's arms for far too long. Why did she ever leave her home? None of this would have happened if she had just been content to stay put. Why couldn't she have been happy where she was? Salomon sat to the left of Marke and across from his betrothed, Gwen, that evening at supper. He was a lucky man. At least he wasn't to be joined with an ugly or repulsive woman. No, Gwen was very desirable. She had long flowing golden-red hair, sparkling blue eyes, an attractive figure. What more could a man ask for? But she's not Fallon, reminded a small voice in his mind. He shook his head slightly, vainly trying to silence the voice. That doesn't matter, he insisted, She doesn't matter to me. But he knew as soon as he thought it that that was most definitely a lie. Fallon mattered a great deal to him. For a reason inexplicable to him, he felt as if he belonged with Fallon, that they had always belonged together. Every time he looked at her, every time he thought about her voice, every time he thought about her smile, his heart felt as though it would burst. He thought, despite having only known her for a short time, that he was falling in love with her. That notion was reinforced by the fact that although Gwen was a pretty and desirable enough woman every time he looked at her he felt like he wanted to throw up. Every time he looked at her and saw her light hair and blue eyes he wanted to run from the room. He wanted to run from the room and find the enchanting maid with dark hair and green eyes who had stolen his heart. He remembered that it would seem impolite if he didn't at least speak to Gwen. \"Are you very tired from your journey, Lady Gwen?\" he asked out of politeness. His thoughts were elsewhere. \"No, not very, milord,\" she replied in a soft timid voice. She was nothing like Fallon. Fallon was strong and brave. She had been defiant and outspoken to him even after she found that he was a noble. Gwen, a noble herself, was weak and soft spoken. He didn't know how he would be able to live with her. \"That is well,\" Marke cut in when an awkward silence descended on the table, \"Your wedding will take place in two nights. I trust you are ready.\" Gwen's father, Lord Cynyr Ceinfarfog answered for her. \"Yes, Marke,\" he said in his gruff voice, \"She is ready. If she's anything like her mother, she'll bear strong children. Your cousin is lucky to have her.\" \"Most certainly,\" Marke responded. Then the door opened and Fallon walked in carrying another basket of rolls. Salomon willed desperately for her to look at him. He wanted to speak to her, to look into her eyes. But, like she had been of late, she avoided meeting his gaze. \"Wench!\" Lord Ceinfarfog called just as she was about to exit the room, \"More wine.\" \"Yes, milord,\" Fallon said as she retrieved the wine pitcher. She obediently walked over to him and filled his cup full. As she was turning to walk away, he reached out with one of his meaty hands and pinched her bottom. For an instant, Salomon saw anger and indignation flare in her eyes, but she quelled her emotions and walked away without a word. Salomon started up from the table, fixing Lord Ceinfarfog with furious glare. His mouth was open ready to pour forth a tirade of wrath, but he felt Marke's hand on his knee under the table, trying to restrain him. Salomon looked to his cousin's eyes and red what the older man was thinking: Don't let your heart get ahead of your sense. Salomon gritted his teeth against the rage and tried to calm himself, but the image of the grubby old man's hand on Fallon kept forcing its way into his mind. He kept his silence through the meal, sullenly staring down at his food. He knew that if he looked at his soon-to-be father-in-law too much, he might explode. Later that night, Salomon bid goodnight to Marke, Lord Ceinfarfog, and his betrothed and went desperately searching for Fallon. He had to at least see her. He wanted to tell her of the revelation that he had had, that he loved her, but he didn't know if he should. What good could come of it? Maybe she didn't even return the sentiment. And even if she did, he still had to marry Gwen….. But still, he wanted her to know. He raced up and down the long corridors.

It was getting late, and he almost considered giving up, but as he rounded the nest corner, he saw another maid. His heart didn't race for he knew this could not be Fallon. This woman's hair was iron gray and pulled back into a bun. It was Bragnae. \"Bragnae!\" he called as she began to walk away. She turned back to him with a look of surprise. \"Yes, milord?\" \"Bragnae,\" he replied out of breath from all the running he had been doing, \"I'm looking for Fallon. Do you know where she is?\" Bragnae bit her lip, and her wrinkles deepened as she creased her forehead in indecision. \"I don't know if I should do that, milord. I…\" \"What do you mean you shouldn't do that?\" Salomon shouted angrily, \"I am to be King of Cornwall when my cousin passes. You owe me respect! Now, where is she?\" Bragnae regarded him warily. \"Milord, forgive me, but may I speak freely?\" Salomon gritted his teeth in anger, but he reminded himself that Bragnae was not the cause of his frustration. He let out his breath slowly, trying to calm himself. \"Yes, Bragnae. What would you like to say?\" She took a deep breath. \"I care deeply for Fallon. She reminds me of….\" A nostalgic look came into her old eyes, but she shook her head and returned to the present. \"Someone. I love her like a daughter. The last thing I want is for her to get hurt. Do you take my meaning, Sir?\" Salomon stared at her sadly for a moment. \"Yes, but….\" He trailed off. He didn't want to stand there and pour his heart out to one of the maids. \"I don't want to hurt her,\" he finished. \"I know you don't,\" she replied, \"But just because you don't want her to hurt doesn't mean she won't.\" \"Will you please just tell me where she is?\" he pleaded, \"I need to see her.\" Bragnae sighed. \"Nothing good will come of this,\" she muttered under her breath. Then louder, \"She is finished with her duties for the night. She just went out to the garden. She said she would be there for a while, so you shouldn't miss her.\" \"Thank you!\" Salomon called over his shoulder as he turned and ran towards the garden. When he got outside, he had to pause and take a deep breath of fresh air. It was such a lovely night. A wonderful night to be out strolling the gardens with Fallon.

He longed to walk behind her and run his hands through that beautiful hair, but he restrained himself. Instead he went and sat down beside her. She gave a startled jump and then moved as if to leave. But Salomon caught her hand and said in a soft voice, \"Please stay, Fallon.\" To his pleasure, she relaxed back down onto the bench. When she tried to pull her hand away, he held onto it and brought it up to his lips. He gently kissed it. Fallon blinked at him in bewilderment. \"You… you know we cannot do this,\" she said sadly. \"And why can't we?\" he asked, even though he knew the answer all too well. He placed another kiss on her hand. This one was more passionate, more needy. \"You are to be married,\" she whispered. He looked into her emerald eyes. They were wide and shining with unshed tears. \"But I'm not married yet,\" he protested as he held her gaze. \"But you will be!\" she argued hotly, wrenching her hand from his grasp and standing up, \"And then what? Then I'll just be some woman you come to when you tire of your wife! I will not be your mistress, Salomon!\" Salomon stood up, still looking at her. \"But don't realize,\" he entreated, \"That you already mean more to me than any mistress ever could? Don't you realize you mean more to me than… her?\" He couldn't even bring himself to say his betrothed's name. A big tear rolled down Fallon's cheek. \"Don't play games with me, Salomon,\" she said softly, \"You proved very well what you wanted from me on the first night I was here.\" Salomon couldn't suppress his groan. He wished that he had never let himself get so out of control that night. He didn't want her to think that he only wanted her for a bedmate. \"Fallon,\" he said, taking a step closer to her, \"I already apologized for that…. I was thinking. Of course I want you in that way, Fallon. But please believe when I say I want much much more from you.\" She was crying openly now. \"More that I can't give, Salomon!\" she sobbed, \"You're a promised man!\" Salomon enfolded her in his arms and held her tightly to his chest, wondering how he managed to keep from crying himself. He ran his hands over her silky tresses and down her back as he murmured soothing words to persuade her to stop crying. When at last, her sobs had dwindled down to soft whimpers and sighs, he whispered, \"I love you, Fallon.\" She liked up at him then. Her lip quivered and he wanted nothing more than to kiss her senseless, but he waited for her reply. \"Oh, I love you,\" she moaned, \"God forgive me, I love you.\" Then he kissed her.

I mean, like this, alone.\" Salomon's spirits soared at her words. He was so happy that she was willing to be with him despite everything. \"Tomorrow night,\" he replied hurriedly, \"And the night after that. My next two nights are yours.\" The statement that after that time, his nights would be Gwen's hung unspoken between them. She nodded and smiled sadly. \"I love you,\" she said softly then turned and quickly ran out of the garden. \"I love you, Fallon!\" he called after her. He turned back and sat on the bench with is head in his hands, not yet ready to retire to his rooms. Neither of them had seen the third person watching them from behind some nearby bushes. Gwen ferch Cynyr stormed back to her chamber furiously. The little scene she had just witnessed in the garden played over and over again in her mind, enraging her. How could this be happening? Here she was, trying to make the best out of an unwanted marriage, and her husband-to-be was already running to the arms of some other woman! And not even a noblewoman! A serving wench! The whole situation was preposterous to her. She was so angry that when she got to her room, she slammed open the door, and it rebounded from the wall with a thundering boom. Rowena, her personal lady's maid, who had been sitting on the edge of Gwen's bed, jumped so high that she nearly fell to the floor. Gwen didn't so much as utter one word of apology. \"The nerve of that pig!\" she exclaimed as she through herself down beside Rowena, \"How dare he do this to me?\" \"What is it, milady?\" Rowena asked in her timid voice. Rowena was her own age and had been her friend as well as her servant for many years, so Gwen did not mind speaking of personal matters with her. \"Lord Salomon,\" she said through gritted teeth, investing buckets of scorn into the title, \"Is tumbling one of the serving wenches.\" She didn't actually know if he was bedding her or not; she hadn't been able to hear all of their conversation.

Then she decided on a plan of action. \"I'm going to make that little wench regret ever looking higher than her station,\" she said, more to herself than to Rowena. Then louder, looking to her maid, she said, \"Make sure that a young maid named Fallon attends me as often as you can, Rowena. I will quell this little relationship before it gets too far.\"[Chapter 7] A/N- Just a note, I edited the love scene, and it is not quite as explicit as it previously was. I wanted to keep a T rating. Discoveries The crowd cheered, but tears ran down Fallon's face. They laughed, but she cried. Salomon stood with Gwen and the priest. As he said his vows, she imagined that he was saying them to her. In his heart, she knew he was. They had met in the garden the past two nights. They talked, and he kissed her. He was a wonderful kisser! Neither of them had spoken much of his impending marriage, but its presence always hung in the air between them. She had hoped that something would happen. That somehow in those two days time, Lord Marke would change his mind and would send Gwen and her father away. But nothing changed. And today she had to watch the man she loved marry another woman. She knew Salomon would never be happy with Gwen. Fallon hated the woman and not just because she was marrying the man that should be hers. She had been ordered to attend the Lady Gwen three times since she and Salomon had declared their love for each other, and Gwen had run her ragged. She ordered her to do the silliest most trivial little things, and then when Fallon finished the task, Gwen berated her for being too slow about it. Nothing Fallon could do ever made her happy. Fallon knew Salomon could not love that. Fallon watched as Salomon leaned over and gave Gwen a chaste kiss on the lips. It was not the same type of loving, tender kiss that he often bestowed on her. Nor was it like that hot lusty kiss he had given her on the first night of there meeting. It was a kiss that was devoid of any passion, any feeling. Fallon managed a small smile through her tears. At least she would always have his passion. As he turned away from his new wife, Salomon's eyes met hers. They spoke no words, but that look that they shared said everything. She felt tears well up in her eyes again, not only for her pain but for his. He hated this as much as she. She mouthed the words 'I love you' even though she knew he could not dare to return them in front of all these people. She turned and began to walk away. Bragnae had agreed to do her part in serving at the wedding feast. Fallon did not think she could manage it. Especially when she was thinking about what would take place after. She could not bear to think about how Gwen would be the woman to have Salomon's children. Gwen would be the one who got to lie down beside him at night. Gwen got to grow old with him. What did Fallon get? Stolen moments of passion in the garden? She didn't even know that she would get that anymore. She didn't know what she would do if she didn't. She went and sat down on their customary bench. She smiled sadly as she thought about how they had spent last night sitting there kissing and touching and talking. He was so wonderful to talk to. She loved everything about him. The way he grinned boyishly when he thought something was amusing. The way his fair locks fell across his forehead. The way his tender lips felt against hers, against her neck. The way his strong arms felt around her waist. The way his big hands held her to his body. The way he loved her. A tear trickled down her cheek. She brushed it away. Then her thoughts turned once again to the upcoming night. Salomon would certainly have to fulfill his duties to his wife on her wedding night. She knew she couldn't hope for anything else, but it was hard to think about the man she loved lying in the arms of another woman. Especially when he had not even made love to her yet. She wasn't angry with him for not making love to her. She hadn't let him know that she was ready, and she wasn't even sure if she was or not. But she would give anything to be the woman he was with tonight. Sometime later she went to her room, Bragnae was there waiting for her. She was glad. Company would do her well tonight. She might need someone to talk to. As the music and cheers from the wedding feast drifted up to their ears, Bragnae held Fallon as she sobbed uncontrollably. She was livid with herself. She had known this would happen. Why hadn't she left? Why had she let him get so deep into her heart? She loved him so much, and yet she knew it was hopeless. The night wore on and all Fallon could think about was what was going on in Salomon's chamber. Bragnae tried to talk to her and keep her mind on other things, but it was no use. Finally, only a few hours before morning, with swollen eyes and a pounding headache, Fallon drifted off into a restless a sleep troubled with dreams. Suddenly, by the grace of all that was good, she was in Salomon's arms, in his bed. She gasped at the overwhelming pleasure of the sensations he gave her. He kissed her lips and then her neck and then lower to her breasts. Fallon moaned as he captured her nipple between his teeth and gave it a sucking kiss. His mouth moved back up to hers, and he kissed her with an intensity and passion such as she had never imagined. She ran her hands down his strong back, slick with sweat. He whispered her name. \"Fallon, Fallon, Fallon.\" Then suddenly it became more insistent. \"Fallon! Fallon!\" Then she was alone and was being shaken. She moaned for Salomon, pleading for him to come back to her. But he was gone. She awoke to Bragnae's shaking. \"Fallon! Fallon!\" she was saying, trying to wake her from her slumber. Fallon let out a cry of loss as she realized that her passionate night with Salomon had been only a dream. It had been so real. She had felt as if he was there with her. Suddenly she looked down and blushed. The sheets of her bed were tangled between her legs, and her whole body was wet with sweat. \"Have you been her the whole time?\" she asked Bragnae as she righted the sheets and pulled them up over her. Bragnae nodded. Fallon sighed. \"Why did you wake me?\" \"Because it is morning, and Lady Gwen has called for you to attend her,\" Bragnae replied solemnly. Fallon fell back and groaned. \"Not again! Especially not after….\" She wanted to say not after Gwen had spent the night with the man that should have belonged to her, but she trailed off into a weary silence. \"I cannot deal with her now.\" Bragnae grabbed her arm and began to pull her off the bed. \"You must, child,\" she persisted, \"The lady has specifically requested your assistance.\" \"Why does she insist on making my life even more miserable?\" Fallon whined as Bragnae thrust her clothes out to her, \"Hasn't she done enough already?\" Bragnae grasped her roughly by the shoulders and gave her a shake. \"Hush that, Fallon,\" she demanded fiercely, \"I know you have the strength of both your parents. I have seen it in your eyes. You will get through this. I know you will. Now, away with this self-pity!\" Fallon didn't know if she should scream at the woman or thank her. But she did know that she should take her advice. But it just seemed so hard, so miserably hopeless. Still, she lifted her chin and blinked away the tears that threatened to fall from her eyes. She calmly took her clothes from Bragnae and began to dress herself. Soon, she was in Gwen's chamber. It gave her some comfort to know that she had not stayed with Salomon through the morning. It gave her comfort to think that maybe he had sent her away sometime during the night. Rowena, the maid that Gwen had brought to Castle Dor with her, worked with Fallon to fix the lady's hair. In Fallon's opinion, the style Gwen wanted to achieve seemed far too extravagant and vulgar. It was an intricate design of knots and braids. Fallon was sure it would take hours to finish. Gwen did not talk much throughout the process, but as they were finishing, she began to relate- more to Rowena than to Fallon- the events of the previous night. \"He was a very attentive lover, Rowena,\" she was saying in her all too sweet voice, \"I had suspected as much. He is very handsome, and his hands are so large and strong.\" Fallon felt her face flushing with anger. How dare she talk like that? She tried to remember Bragnae's words, not to despair, and moved to go ready the lady's hot cider. She tried her best to ignore Gwen's words, but it seemed as if the other woman could not help but rub salt in her already sore wounds. \"He liked to kiss and nibble my neck,\" she continued with a giggle as she reached one of her delicate hands up to her slender white neck and gently touched it, \"He also liked to caress my breasts. It was simply amazing.\" Despite her best efforts, tears of hurt and rage sprang to Fallon's eyes and blurred her vision. Could what she was saying be true? Could Salomon have really made love to her like she was saying he had? Of course, Fallon knew he had had to do it… but she did not think he would have reveled in it as Gwen described. She was so distraught, and her vision was so hindered by her tears, that she knocked over a glass and it fell to the floor with a crash. Gwen bounded from her chair and rushed over to where Fallon was kneeling, trying to gather the shattered shards of glass. \"You clumsy, ox!\" she exclaimed. And Fallon was reeled backwards by a stunning blow to her cheek. Fallon's hand immediately went to her face as she gave an indignant, angry gasp. Then she jumped to her feet and grabbed the pitcher of steaming hot cider. With a shout of rage, she flung its contents at Gwen. Gwen screamed as the hot liquid splashed onto her stomach and chest. Fallon noted with triumph that the stain would probably never come out of that dress. \"You horrid wench!\" Gwen screamed. Rowena rushed over to her with a small towel and began dabbing at the ruined dress, but Gwen shoved her away. \"I will speak to the king about this! You will be out of this castle by nightfall! You will regret ever crossing me. Now, get out of my sight!\" Fallon contained her smirk until she was safely out the door. She went to her room and about an hour later Bragnae stormed in in a huff. \"Everyone's tongues are wagging about you being insolent with Lady Gwen!\" she exclaimed, \"It's said that you doused her with hot cider!\" Fallon lifted her chin stubbornly. \"I did.\" \"Whatever were you thinking, you foolish, foolish girl?\" Fallon stood and busied herself with brushing out her long dark hair. \"I don't know what came over me,\" she replied calmly. \"Well, the lady is in an uproar,\" Bragnae continued heatedly, \"And with all the fuss she is stirring up, you'll be turned out of the castle.\" \"If that happens,\" she replied, \"Then I will go back to my home or maybe I will travel. I don't know what to do. But whatever happens, happens.\" Bragnae glared at her angrily. \"I don't know that I ever thought anyone would be as troublesome as your mother was,\" she growled, \"But you certainly rival her.\" She stomped back out the door without another word, leaving Fallon sitting motionlessly in front of the mirror. Marke sat on his throne as he rubbed his temples. This was not good at all. He had known from the start that the young maid, Fallon, would cause more trouble than he could handle. He knew that because he knew Salomon's feelings for her. Marke had seen the look they shared at the wedding. Both of the young lovers' eyes were so filled with love and longing that he was bewildered that other people failed to see it. It painfully reminded him of how Tristan and Isolde had been. He had failed to recognize that until it was too late. Something about Fallon tickled his memory, taking him back to the days when he first became King of Cornwall. Whenever he saw her, he couldn't place his finger on precisely what it was, but something was there. He was about to think more about it, but a knock came at his door. \"Enter,\" he said. The door to his throne room opened and Bragnae walked in. Despite the fact that she was one of the maid's, Marke was close to her. She had been there ever since Isolde had came, what seemed like so long ago, and she had been a faithful employee even after Tristan's death and Isolde's disappearance. Bragnae curtsied quickly at the door then approached him. \"Milord Marke,\" she began, bringing her hands up in a pleading fashion, \"I come here to beg for you not to be to hard on Fallon.\" Marke sighed. \"I expected as much when you entered, Bragnae,\" he said wearily, \"I noticed that you had become quite attached to the girl in these past days since she came here. Tell me why I shouldn't banish her from the castle. She assaulted Lady Gwen, the woman who is going to be queen here when I pass. That is not something that should be taken lightly. I agreed to give her work here because you asked me to, Bragnae. But I cannot have troublemakers on my staff.\" \"Sir,\" she pleaded, \"Please. The girl is having a hard time….\" She hesitated then continued. \"She is gone from her home. She has not other place to go. Please, milord. I am begging you. I will see to it that she causes no more trouble.\" Marke chuckled mirthlessly. \"Not cause anymore trouble? I am old, Bragnae, but I have not lost my wits yet. I have seen the way she looks at my cousin and the way he looks at her. I believe that that is the main cause of today's… excitement. How can you control her? I must send her away, Bragnae. It is for the best.\" \"No, milord, please!\" she exclaimed as she fell to her knees before him, clutching at his boots, \"You mustn't.\" She looked up at him with eyes shining with unshed tears. \"She is much more than she seems.\" Normally, Marke would have laughed. Normally. But Bragnae had just voiced the thought that Marke had been trying to force down ever since the young woman arrived. He pretended indifference. \"How so?\" \"Milord,\" she whispered shakily, \"Milord, sh-she is… is the daughter of Isolde and Tristan.\" Marke bounded up from his chair. \"How do you know this?\" he demanded a little more harshly than he had intended. His hands and knees were shaking…. That was what had been so familiar about her… what he couldn't place. \"She told me, milord,\" Bragnae continued softly, \"And I believe her. Don't you see it? In the way she looks? Her manner?\" Marke wearily collapsed back down into his throne. \"Can it be?\" he whispered. Then he recalled the girl's face. She had Isolde's eyes, Isolde's high elegant cheekbones, and Isolde's gracefully arched brows. The shape of her face was Tristan's, as was her hair, and some of her other facial features. The poised way she moved reminded him so much of Isolde that it was unbelievable. Her assured manner almost made him think that Tristan's spirit had found flesh in his daughter. He didn't know how the truth had evaded him until now. \"But if she…\" he began with some hopefulness, \"What of Isolde?\" Bragnae was already shaking her head. \"Dead soon after childbirth, milord,\" she told him sadly. A tear trickled down her cheek. \"Fallon was raised by foster parents. She didn't even know of her lineage until a few days before Salomon brought her here.\" She paused. \"You know where he found her, don't you?\" Marke nodded slowly. \"At the riverbank… where Tristan's body lay. She left her home searching for some information about her parents.\" He knew she was Tristan's. It was obvious by her looks and manner that she was the daughter of Tristan and not himself. Bragnae nodded. \"Yes, milord…. What are you going to do?\" Marke shook his head. \"I don't know.\" He sighed. \"Send her to me.\" Bragnae nodded and left the room. Almost an hour later, the door opened again. Fallon, her raven tresses hanging loose about her face, poked her head in. Marke met her dazzling emerald eyes- Isolde's eyes- and she came the rest of the way in. \"You wanted to see me, milord?\" she asked timidly, now focusing her eyes on the ground. She shuffled closer to him and offered him a small curtsy. \"Yes, Fallon,\" he replied, \"I did.\" She looked at the ground and kicked at her skirts nervously. \"I suppose it is about my actions this morning?\" Marke nodded. \"Partly.\" He wasn't exactly sure how he should go about this. \"What are you going to do, milord?\" Once again her eyes met his, but this time they were not timid. In the depths of those emerald orbs was strength and boldness. \"I cannot have you working on my maid staff and causing trouble,\" he told her, \"You are no longer a maid in Castle Dor, Fallon.\" She nodded and a small tear trickled down her cheek. \"I thought as much, milord.\" \"However,\" he continued, \"I cannot turn out the daughter of two people that I loved dearly.\" She looked up at him then, startled. \"Milord, how…? Who told you that… I was… I…. Bragnae?\" Marke nodded. \"Bragnae.\" Before he could say more, she began to pour out words nervously and hurriedly. \"Milord, I asked her not to tell anyone. I didn't want you to think I was coming her expecting anything. I'm not, I swear. I don't want anything like money or titles. I just wanted information… and then a home…. Please don't be angered.\" Marke gazed at her for a moment before answering. He had meant to berate her from withholding that kind of information from him. But as he looked down at her, all he angry words went out of his head. He was suddenly taken back to the past. He still felt love for both Tristan and Isolde despite everything that had happened. And now as he looked at their daughter he felt love for her too, despite the fact that she was Isolde's daughter by Tristan and not by him. \"I am not angered, Fallon,\" he said softly, \"I cared deeply for both your mother and your father, and I can see much of them in you.\" There was a long moment of silence. Then he said, \"You will remain here at Castle Dor, no longer as a maid, but as an honored guest. I will have clothes made for you and….\" \"Please, milord….\" She began but then hesitated. \"What is it, Fallon?\" he asked. \"If it is not too much to ask, milord… may I use the dresses of my mother's please?\" Marke was touched, and it took a moment for him to find his voice. \"Of course,\" he answered, \"Whatever suits you.\" \"Thank you, milord,\" she whispered. He cleared his throat and continued with what he was saying. \"You will now dine with the other nobles and me.\" A look of indecision and a mix of pain and excitement crossed her eyes, and he knew only too well what it was for. But he continued on. \"And you may move your things to a better chamber if you like.\" \"Thank you, milord,\" she said again, \"Is that all?\" He nodded his dismissal, but as she turned to go he stopped her. \"Fallon?\" \"Yes, milord?\" \"What you did to Lady Gwen this morning was uncalled for,\" his said in a firm voice, \"I do not expect to have any problems like that again.\" Fallon hesitated before finally answering, \"Of course not, milord.\" \"Good. Dismissed.\" \"Thank you, milord.\" She turned and briskly walked out of the room. He decided to leave the subject of his cousin for another talk. He silently pondered the wonders of all that had been discovered that day. Salomon sat with his head in his hands on the edge of his bed. He had so much to think about. It was mind-boggling. Fallon, he had just found out, was actually the daughter of Marke's late wife, Isolde, and his champion, Tristan. He had just been married and consummated his marriage the night before. And the woman he had married was not the woman he loved. His head was swimming with thoughts. He thought back to the morning's events. Gwen had stormed into his room, raving about some 'serving wench' who had ruined her dress. He did not have to think hard to figure out that it was Fallon. Gwen had been furious when she saw that he was more amused than upset. He hadn't seen Fallon all day. The lost time he had looked into her eyes had been when he had just finished saying his vows the night before, and his whole soul longed for her. He needed to see her again. Soon. They had a lot to talk about. He couldn't believe she was a Princess, or at least something close to a Princess. That would certainly change some things. She would no longer have to serve. She would dine with them, with him . He wanted to go to her then, but he knew he had to wait until nightfall. He groaned. Would Gwen demand his company this night also? It had been hard to make love to her at first, but soon he was imagining that it was Fallon he was lying with not Gwen. He found it much easier to accomplish it when he thought about being with Fallon. Still, he had not enjoyed it much at all. Especially afterwards. He had just laid there beside his new wife thinking about how he had betrayed Fallon. He wished he could change things. He wished he could be with her like she wanted him to be, but he didn't know how to make things right. He snuck out of his room at sundown and secretively made his way to Fallon's room. He would have gone straight to the garden, but she had not known to meet him there. But when he got to her room, he found Bragnae alone. \"Bragnae,\" he said, \"Where's Fallon?\" The old woman sighed and shook her head. \"Why should I tell you?\" she demanded angrily, \"Future king or no, I will not let you hurt that girl anymore! You should have seen her last night. She cried for hours.\" Salomon's heart ached for Fallon. He couldn't bear the thought of her crying, especially when he was the cause. \"I'm sorry,\" he said softly, pleadingly, \"But I have to see her.\" Bragnae growled and muttered something under her breath before saying, \"Do you know of the old trap door in the bottom of the keep?\" Salomon thought a minute and nodded. \"Yes.\" Bragnae sighed again. \"Go through that trap door and follow the passage. She said she'd be somewhere down there. You'll find her.\" He was about to bolt out of the door but Bragnae stopped him. \"Milord, I'm only telling you this because it is what I think she wants. If she ever gives me reason to believe that she no longer wants your attentions, I will stop telling you her whereabouts.\" Salomon nodded. \"I understand, Bragnae.\" He didn't think that would ever be a problem though. Fallon knew the depths of his feelings for her, and he knew the depths of her feelings for him. As quickly as he knew how, he made his way down to the keep. When he got to the keep he lit a torch. Then he opened the trapdoor and peered down into the dark depths. He began walking down the dusty stone steps, and he wondered if anyone ever used the old Roman passageway anymore. The last time he had heard of it being used had been when the Irish had invaded and almost taken Castle Dor and when Fallon's father had died and her mother disappeared. At first, Salomon wasn't sure if he was going to be able to find her. But then he saw her. She was standing with her back to him. She had put her torch in a holder on the wall and was no examining an old Roman painting. Suddenly she looked over her shoulder, and their eyes met. For a long time neither of them said anything. Finally, she spoke. \"I'm surprised to see you here, Salomon. I thought your wife might want your attentions tonight.\" Her voice was too calm, and he knew something was wrong. \"I wanted to see you, Fallon,\" he told her as he walked up to her and caressed her cheek gently, \"I went to your room, and Bragnae told me where you were. I needed to see you.\" \"Yes, well, from what I hear about last night you enjoyed yourself far more with Gwen than you ever have with me!\" she said angrily as she drew her face out of his reach and turned her back on him once again. \"What?\" he asked, bewildered, \"I have no idea what you are talking about.\" \"Of course you don't, Salomon,\" she agreed sarcastically. She scoffed. \"Don't lie to me. I heard all about it this morning from your wife.\" Salomon groaned. \"So that was what it was all about?\" She huffed. He made an effort to put his arms around her, but she evaded his touch. \"Honestly, Fallon!\" he exclaimed, \"Are you really taking her word over mine? Don't you trust me?\" That caused her to turn back around and face him. She looked somewhat abashed. So he continued, \"Fallon, I would not have done that if I didn't have to. Know that if I could have somehow made her trade places with you, I would have. I thought about you the whole time.\" Her face crumpled in anguish, and tears began to fall down her cheeks. He enfolded her in his arms. She cried into his chest and held on to his shoulders. She sobbed, \"Not being able to have you hurts so badly, Salomon.\" He tipped her chin up and kissed her lips passionately. She returned it with fervor as she cried. His tongue delved into her mouth, tasting her, savoring her. He didn't know how long it lasted, but when their lips parted, he was gasping for breath. Fallon was still gasping sobs. He held her close to him as he whispered, \"I love you, Fallon. No matter what, I'll always love you. That's what matters: we love each other.\" She subdued her sobs and looked up at him. He brushed his fingers across her beautiful tear stained cheek as she searched for words. When she did speak, he was speechless. \"Salomon, make love to me.\" Her voice was a barely audible whisper, as if she was unsure of herself. \"What?\" he asked, unable to disguise his surprise or his hope. \"I want you to make love to me, Salomon,\" she insisted more forcefully, \"I need you. Please.\" She gripped the material of his shirt in fists and pressed herself more firmly against him. He groaned quietly at the feeling of her soft breasts pressed against his chest. \"Fallon,\" he breathed, \"Are you sure you're ready?\" He hoped she was. \"Yes, my love,\" she said, \"I want you, and if I can't have you as your wife, then I will have you as your mistress. I love you, Salomon.\" \"You know you are much more to me than a mistress, Fallon,\" he told her shakily as his hands moved over her back, \"I love you too. You know you are my wife in my heart.\" They lay down there on the hard, dirty floor, but it was as grand as the king's bed to them. He ran his hands up and down her body, wanting to feel all of her, to possess her, to love her. She was his, and as much as he hated to admit his weakness, he belonged to her as well. They were a perfect match, and if circumstances had been different… but he banished those thoughts from his mind. The only thing that mattered was her laying there beneath him. \"You're so beautiful,\" he murmured as he trailed kisses down the soft skin of her throat and chest. She chuckled throatily in reply as his fingers found the laces of her dress and began to untie them. In no time her body was bared to him, and she watched as he stared down at her with eyes clouded and heavy lidded with desire. She didn't want to wait any longer. \"Salomon,\" she breathed urgently, \"Please.\" He grinned triumphantly at the effect he had on her. She didn't have time to berate him for being so arrogant, for then he began kissing his way down her body again, and then every thought went out of Fallon's head. She was consumed with ecstasy. He took her gently, and when they both reached the peak together it was as if their souls were one. They lay there for some time after, simply holding each other in their arms. The sounds of their heavy breathing filled the air. Salomon lovingly stroked her dark hair, now damp with perspiration as he gazed down at her beautiful, serene face. They both drifted off into a peaceful and satisfied sleep.[Chapter 8] Tragedy Fallon idly played with the golden hair on Salomon's chest as she watched him sleep. She had awoke only moments before, and he had looked so peaceful. The hard lines of his face had softened, and he looked young, or rather he looked his age. Despite only being 19 years old, he seemed much older than her at times. She smiled lazily as she lightly traced her finger down his cheek. She blushed with guilty pleasure as she recalled what they had been doing before they drifted off. She had never imagined that any man could ever make her feel like that. His hands had felt so right, so wonderful on her body. She curled up against Salomon's strong chest, prepared to go back to sleep for a few moments, but as she did Salomon's eyelids fluttered opened, and she looked up into his stunning blue orbs. He kissed her forehead gently. \"How long have I been asleep?\" he asked. Fallon shrugged and put her arms around him. \"I don't know. I woke up only a few moments ago, but I don't know how long I slept,\" she told him as she nuzzled against his chest. Salomon tipped her face up to his and gave her a slow lingering kiss that was full of love and satisfaction. She sighed pleasantly against his mouth. When he was kissing her and touching her like this it was almost as if the world was all their's, as if there was no Gwen, no Lord Marke, no Cornwall. There was only Fallon and Salomon lying in each other's arms making love. \"I didn't hurt you too badly, did I, my love?\" he asked after a moment. Fallon shook her head and kissed his chest. \"No,\" she replied, \"You were very gentle, my Lord.\" She grinned mischievously. \"In fact, I enjoyed every minute of it.\" Salomon grinned down at her with a lusty twinkle in his eyes. \"Oh did you?\" he asked in a throaty voice as his hand moved up to caress her breast. She shivered with pleasure. She leaned forward and lightly nibbled on his collar bone. She was about to open her mouth and tell him just how much she wanted him to make love to her again, but the sound of footsteps on stone reached their ears. Salomon sat up just as Bragnae, torch in hand, rounded the corner. Fallon yelped in embarrassment and tried her best to cover her nakedness with Salomon's cloak. Bragnae seemed to be just as surprised. \"Fallon!\" she gasped in surprise as she turned her back to them. Fallon's cheeks burned with mortification. Why did Bragnae have to choose then to come down and interrupt them? Well, maybe then was better than if she had come earlier. Her blush deepened. Had Bragnae come when she and Salomon were making love, Fallon was sure she would have never been able to forget the embarrassment. Salomon soothingly wrapped his cloak around her and situated himself behind her so that they were both covered. \"We have been looking all over for you two!\" Bragnae exclaimed heatedly, \"I didn't expect you to stay down here this long!\" \"How long have we been down here?\" Fallon asked quietly. \"All night,\" the older woman replied. She began to say more but hesitated. \"Bragnae, something's wrong,\" Salomon said from behind her in a deep, level voice, \"What is it?\" It was only then that Fallon saw how red and puffy Bragnae's eyes were. \"Bragnae…?\" she entreated softly, her voice filled with worry. \"Lord Marke is dead.\" Salomon stiffened behind her. \"No,\" he whispered, \"He was fine… old of course, but… fine…. I was sure he had at least a few more years….\" Bragnae simply shook her head and sniffed. \"It happened in his sleep,\" she informed them, \"Peacefully. He felt no pain. I'm so sorry, Milord.\" Salomon's breathing had quickened. \"I…. It's just…. He….\" His voice was thick with tears. \"Oh, Salomon,\" Fallon breathed as she turned and wrapped her arms around him. She knew that he and Lord Marke had been close. She knew how hard this must be for him. He rested his head heavily on her breast, and she could feel tears trickle from his eyes down onto her skin. Knowing the emotional pain he was in caused her own tears to brim over and fall into his flaxen hair. \"I'm so sorry,\" she whispered. She looked up at Bragnae and motioned for her to go. Bragnae gave her a look at first, but she saw that Fallon was not going to leave Salomon in the state that he was in, and she complied. Fallon knew that she would know to let the search for Salomon go on until he was ready to show himself. They could think of an excuse as to why he had been missing since last night…. Not that anyone would challenge him really. He was king now. Fallon thought about that as she made soothing sounds and ran her fingers gently through his pale blonde locks of hair. He was only 19, and already he had a kingdom of his own. She couldn't imagine the stress and pressure that would be in store for him because of that. Ever since she had met him, Fallon had always thought that he seemed much older than he really was, but that still did not change the fact that he was only 19. So much for him to bear. Her heart broke for him. After a few moments, he pulled away from her. \"I guess we had better go,\" he said, not looking at her. \"Salomon, I am so sorry,\" she said as she gently caressed his cheek, \"Know that I will be here for you through this. I love you.\" He smiled a shaky smile that didn't quite touch his icy blue eyes. \"Thank you,\" he replied, \"I love you too.\" He sighed and reached for his trousers and boots. \"I wish we had had more time down here. If I could pretend the world wasn't real and stay down here with you forever, I would.\" \"As would I, my love,\" Fallon murmured as she gave him his shirt. She stood and walked to where her dress was strewn heedlessly on the floor. They dressed in silence. When Salomon was clothed, he came over to her and helped her with the stays of her dress. When he finished, he pressed his cheek to the back of her shoulder and let out a sigh. She knew that now he wasn't thinking about only his cousin's death or his kingship but about having to return to the real world. She was thinking about it too. \"This isn't the last time I'll be down here with you, I promise you that,\" he whispered to her with conviction, \"No matter what happens now, I'll always have time for you. King or no.\" \"I know,\" she replied quietly. Still, she couldn't help but worry. As king, he would have many duties. Many duties that would take him away from her. She was being selfish. She knew she shouldn't think that way, but when it came to Salomon her heart ruled over her brains. And he would have to spend more time with Gwen. That thought tore at her heart. Being King of Cornwall, he would have to start thinking about producing heirs. Since she was not his lawful wife, she could not be the woman to bear him those heirs. That woman would be Gwen. Fallon wondered if soon his nights would be taken away from her as well. Salomon watched with tear filled eyes as his cousin's funeral pyre was lit. Lord Marke of Cornwall. He had been a wonderful man and a good king. Salomon didn't think he could hope to come close to being as good a king. He would have to try. It was his duty. Duty. That word made him turn his head to look at the woman standing next to him. She was not the woman he wished would be standing there. How he longed to feel Fallon's warm, comforting arms around him at this time! Gwen simply stood. Mute, cold, unmoving. No doubt she had some idea of where he had been. Her recent abnormal animosity towards Fallon told him that she knew that Fallon was much more to him than he could show in public. Fallon stood a few paces away with Bragnae, even though she was no longer obligated to remain with the servants. Salomon could tell by the look in her eyes that she wanted to be with him, to soothe him. He prayed a silent prayer that he could somehow fix the whole mess. When the funeral ceremony was over and they were walking away, Gwen finally chose to speak. \"Maybe it would be best if you tried a little harder to hide your tryst with the wench,\" she said, voice dripping with venom, \"This morning everyone knew that you were off somewhere tumbling that whore.\" Salomon clenched his hands into fists. He was nearly shaking with rage. He wanted to swing his fist around and hit her, but he restrained himself, instead fixing her with the coldest, harshest glare he could muster. \"And maybe it would be best if you didn't speak of the daughter of Lord Marke's late wife as if she were common filth.\" She met his furious glare for an instant more before turning away silently. Salomon turned his gaze up to where Fallon was walking with Bragnae. What would this do to her? Gwen would certainly try her best to make her life a living Hell. And her reputation-if it was not already- would be ruined. Not for the first time, he felt a stab of guilt over what he was doing. She was but 16, little more than a child, and already she was thrown into this. But when he thought about letting her go, it felt as if someone was trying to rip out his heart.[Chapter 9] A/N- Again, I edited the love scene. An Important Action Two days after Lord Marke's funeral, Salomon's coronation took place. Fallon stood by Bragnae's side as he was crowned King of Cornwall. Although she didn't have to stand with the servants, she felt that she didn't belong anywhere else. Of course, if not for Gwen, she would have been standing by Salomon, but she knew she could not continue to live her life based on 'if' and 'if not.' As she looked up at Salomon's sorrowful, weary blue eyes, Fallon thought about leaving. Even though she loved him more than life itself, how could she stay if she was causing him this much pain? He didn't need their situation weighing on him now that he had a kingdom to run. But she didn't have the courage to do it. She thought about how bleak her life would be without him. Salomon was like her sun. He made every day worth living. If she had to wake up every morning with the knowledge that he wouldn't be there to talk to, to see, to hold, then she didn't think she would be able to make herself get out of bed every morning. Without him, she would give up. Anger shadowed her sorrow when she watched the crown placed on Gwen's head. A wide smile spread across her pretty features as her eyes scanned the crowd. Then her light blue orbs landed on Fallon, and Fallon knew she did not mistake the triumph she saw written there. She wished more than anything that Gwen was just a bad dream, a horrible nightmare, but she knew that wishing wouldn't get her anywhere and Gwen was true, living, breathing, flesh. She was a nightmare walking. Finally, the coronation was over. It was wonderful to see the honor of kingship bestowed upon Salomon, but seeing the crown of queen placed on Gwen's golden hair was just a painful reminder of what Fallon would never get to be. The days went by rather uneventfully. Each rising and setting of the sun was bleak and mundane for Fallon, for other than brief stolen kisses in deserted hallways and cold, uncomfortable dinners, she no longer got to spend time with Salomon. His kingly duties occupied his days, and Gwen occupied his nights. Not a night went by when Fallon did not curl up in her cold, lonely bed and cry herself to sleep. Dinner that night was no different from the way dinner every night for the past week and half had been. The only sounds that filled the large room were the metallic clanging of forks and spoons against plates accompanied with the occasional scurrying of a servant. Fallon was content to stare down blandly at her meal. It was easier if she didn't look up, for then she could almost pretend that Gwen wasn't there, that it was only she and Salomon at the table. If not for the uncomfortable silence and tension that filled the air, it would have been almost convincing. \"Lord Salomon, would you like more wine?\" A long pause. \"Lord Salomon?\" Fallon glanced up when she heard the servant repeat the question. Salomon's eyes met hers with a fiery passion that she had only seen glimpses of in the past few weeks. They burned through her, searing her soul with the strength of his desire. Seeing those usually cold blue eyes filled with such heat for her sent a shiver of lust down her spine. But then Gwen cleared her throat, ruining the moment. \"I'm sorry,\" Salomon said turning to the servant girl, \"My mind was elsewhere.\" His eyes once again flicked to Fallon. \"On an important action.\" Fallon went back to resignedly eating her meal, but her heart was pounding in her chest and her mind was racing. An important action. Could that mean he wanted to be with her tonight? Or was he just fishing for words to make an excuse for ignoring the servant? She hoped against all hope that it was the former. She hated being like this, clinging to his every word, every attention. Before Salomon, what seemed like an eternity ago, she wasn't like this. She was independent. She didn't hang on the words of anyone. Still, she couldn't imagine how bleak her life would have been had she never met him. When dinner came to a close and the three left their seats, Fallon was at a loss as to what to do. Did she go to her room and try to sleep, never knowing if Salomon had really wanted her tonight? No, that option was immediately discarded in her mind. How could she do that? Instead, she decided that she would go down to the trap door and wait for him in the abandoned hallways underneath Castle Dor where they had made love for the first time. If his words had been meant for her, then maybe he would find her down there. If not then she would retire to bed alone as she had been every night for too long. She pulled her cloak tight about her face as she walked, hiding in corners when she heard someone approaching. She would not take that chance of being found by someone and deterred. No one knew of her intention to go down to the abandoned trapdoor, not even Bragnae, and she did not intend to alter that fact. Quietly, she lifted the trapdoor when she reached her destination. A soft creak echoed in the antechamber, but no one was near enough to hear it. She lit one of the torches at the top, and then began a slow descent down the old stone stairway. Her heart thumped, and she didn't know if it was for fear of being found or for anticipation of the long night ahead if Salomon chose to meet her. She shivered pleasantly as she thought about being with him again. He had been so attentive to her needs and wants. His touch had sent heat all through her body. She moaned aloud thinking of him. \"I hope you're thinking about me,\" came a husky voice from behind her. She whirled around, breath coming out of her in a rush. \"Salomon, you're here,\" she sighed. \"I couldn't stay away from you any longer,\" he said hoarsely, \"No matter what she said.\" At her perplexed look, he explained, \"Gwen has been threatening that if she found that I had been with you again, she would write her father. Well, gods damn Gwen and damn her father! I am King of Cornwall! And I'll be with the woman I love no matter what anyone says!\" And with that he took her up in his arms and kissed her thoroughly. His lips were insistent and rough against hers as his tongue delved deep into her mouth. With his hands pinning her wrists up against the wall and his body smashing down on hers, she was helpless and totally vulnerable to him. Not that she wanted him to stop. His kiss was one of the most sensual things she had ever experienced, all the better because it seemed like it had been an eternity since their last. She could think of nothing better than to be pressed up against a wall with Salomon's lean, hard body rubbing against hers. She wanted more. And so did Salomon. When he took her this time, he showed none of the tender gentleness he had before. Up against the wall, their love making was hard, fast, urgent. Fallon moaned and gave herself to him with reckless abandon. They had been apart too long, and they both knew they might not get another chance like this one in a long time. They did not have time to waste on what was good and proper. They stood like that for a long time after they finished, Fallon resting her head weakly on his shoulder. Then a few moments later when both had recovered their breath, Salomon stood back and buttoned his trousers, then helped her with her dress. \"I'm sorry,\" he said quietly, gesturing to a tear in her dress, \"I couldn't control myself.\" \"It's alright,\" Fallon replied just as softly, \"I didn't want you too.\" Salomon nodded his understanding and then took her in his arms, gently now. \"Would I be a welcome guest in your bed tonight, fair lady?\" he asked as he planted a tender kiss on her cheekbone, \"For I would much like to make up for the time that we have lost.\" Her heart soared. \"You are always welcome in my bed, my king.\"[Chapter 10] A/N- Okay, this is the last chapter that I had published under my old account. Expect new ones in the very near future. Plots Salomon looked on Fallon with tender, loving eyes as she slept. Her raven locks were spread out across the pillow, and her breasts rose and fell softly with the deep breaths of sleep. She looked so beautiful laying there, her elegant, dark brows, her full, pink lips, her high, rosy cheeks. She was a rare work of art. And he could not love her more. He smoothed her dark hair back and placed a soft kiss on her shoulder as he thought about the night that they had shared. It had been so beautiful, so perfect. He hated that it was coming to an end. But he would not let it be the last. He swore right then on his beloved cousin's grave that he would be with Fallon again. He would never forget about her or leave her laying aside. She was the world to him. Forever and always. With that last on his mind, he sighed. Gently, he shook Fallon's shoulder, urging her to wake. \"Fallon,\" he said softly as he kissed her, \"Wake up, my love. It's nearly morning.\" Fallon groaned groggily and returned his kiss. \"No,\" she moaned. \"Yes,\" he sighed in reply, \"Though I hate to say it. The night has come to an end, sweet sweet Fallon.\" She drew her brows together and slowly opened her eyes. \"Why does it have to be over?\" she mumbled as she burrowed into his side. Salomon stroked his hand down her bare back. \"If I could stop the sun from rising,\" he told her, \"But alas, even a king cannot do that.\" He looked out the window to the gray light of dawn before sighing again. \"I have to get back to my chamber, you know.\" \"I hate her,\" Fallon said softly, tears springing to her eyes as she looked up at him. \"I know you do,\" he replied as he kissed her forehead, \"And if there was something I could do to change this, I would… but right now, I don't know what to do. I promise you, I will think of something for us to do, and until I figure it out, I will not stop coming here to your chamber. Every night that I can, I will be with you. Do you believe me?\" \"Yes,\" she answered. Her eyes looked child-like and innocent as she gazed up at him, wholly trusting. He knew that he could never hurt her, for if he did, it would be her whole undoing. \"I believe you, with all my heart.\" He offered her a small smile, assuring her that he would keep his promise. Then he stood and began to dress. His clothes and Fallon's dress and shift lay strewn carelessly on the floor by the bed. Last night, neither of them had been of any mind to carefully fold and put away their clothing. They had been too preoccupied with their longing to think of anything else. Now, Fallon watched from the bed as he dressed. He looked at her as he pulled his trousers on. She was propped up on her elbow, smiling pointedly at his bare chest and torso. \"You're beautiful,\" she said, her smile growing wider. He grinned at her and replied, \"So are you.\" She laughed. It was times like these with her that he could forget about the world. He hated that he would have to leave that magic behind. His expression sobered as he finished buttoning up his shirt and went over to Fallon on the bed. \"I have to go,\" he said solemnly. Her expression followed his. \"I know,\" she replied in an almost inaudible voice, \"One last kiss before you go?\" She lifted her head hopefully. \"Of course,\" he said, \"How could I leave without tasting your lips once more.\" He bent and gave her a long, slow kiss. His tongue dipped into her mouth, tasting her sweet essence. It was an instant of pure rapture, and he never wanted to end it. Finally, it was Fallon who pulled back. \"You have to go,\" she stated. She turned her head the other direction. He suspected it was to hide tears. He nodded and walked to the door. \"I love you, Fallon. Forever.\" He left before she had the chance to reply. Salomon knew before he opened the door that his room was occupied. The soft light of candles shown out of the crack underneath the door. He feared he knew who it was… and his fears were backed when he pushed open the door and entered. \"Ah, so the king returns from his nighttime tryst.\" Gwen lounged on the bed idly twirling a strand of her golden red hair between two of her slender fingers. She appeared utterly bored and indifferent, but he knew better than that. He could tell by the unqualified rage in her eyes that she was the exact opposite. \"So nice of you to join me.\" Salomon glared at her. \"Why are you here uninvited?\" he asked coldly. She laughed liltingly. \"Am I not allowed in my own husband's bedchamber, hmm?\" she asked innocently, \"I believe as your wife I am authorized to be here.\" He bristled. \"As king ,\" he growled, \"I forbid you to be here without my permission.\" Her eyebrows climbed to the top of her forehead. \"Oh, you forbid me, Salomon?\" she queried. Her voice had become a deadly calm, and by that he knew that she was even angrier than she had been to start with. \"You forbid me ?\" When he didn't dignify her fury with a response, she smiled but it didn't reach her cold eyes. \"We'll see about this, Salomon,\" she told him as she moved towards the door, \"Do you honestly think I'll let you sabotage my name by continuing your little romance with this common girl?\" She shook her head. \"No. Just wait, my husband.\" The door slammed behind her. Salomon didn't know exactly what she planned on, but he didn't want to contemplate it. After all, he was king, and she was his wife. How much could she do? Lord Cynyr Ceinfarfog sat at his table. Rage filled his heart and his mind as he looked down at the letter he had just received. This was an outrage . The read went as follows: Dear father, It is with a heavy heart and a weary head that I write to you. I am ashamed to have to tell you what I am writing to you for. I have been disgraced, and in so, you have been disgrace, my lord. The husband you chose for me has proven less than we both thought. I understand that this is no fault of your own. A situation such as this could not have been foreseen by you. We were both fooled by the late Lord Marke and his treacherous cousin. Now I will inform you of the nature of my shame. My husband has been conducting an affair. Yes, I know that this is common among men, and I do not object to him having a tryst or two if he were to conduct it appropriately in a manner that did not sully my honor. But what he is doing is simply mocking me! He openly goes to the chamber of another woman every night and is often seen with her whenever he has a free moment. All of the staff and guests here at Castle Dor know that truly I am not queen here, but simply an unwanted resident. My authority is in jeopardy. My lord, I beseech you, as your daughter, to do something about this other woman, Fallon is her name. Come to Cornwall. Take her away from him. I want my honor back, and I know that you would not want me shamed in this way. You have seen this woman before when you brought me here. She worked as a maid. I believe you would find her to be an attractive young woman, for she is, as much as I despise her, rather pleasing to the eye. Take her as your plaything. I do not care what you do with her, so long as she is removed from Castle Dor. I trust that you will make the right decision. Thank you. Your obedient daughter, Gwen ferch Cynyr Queen of Cornwall. He slammed his fist down on the hard, wooden surface of the table. How could she have allowed this to happen? This was disgusting! He thought he had taught his daughter to maintain her authority when she ruled. Obviously he had done a less than satisfactory job than he had previously thought. No. He shook his head with a sigh. He needed to channel his wrath in the appropriate direction. Gwen was not the one at fault in this situation. Granted, he thought she could have probably nipped her husband's little affair in the bud before it escalated, but truthfully it was not all her fault. The fault lied with her treacherous husband, Lord Salomon. He was the problem, he and this Fallon. Now Lord Ceinfarfog had no choice but to take action. If his daughter could not settle this problem, then he would. He set his mind to plotting.[Chapter 11] A/N- Ok, first new chapter. This one will be short. Go easy on me since it has been like 3 years since I've written anything on this story :P Surprise When she wasn't sneaking away for romantic liaisons with Salomon, Fallon managed to create some semblance of normal life for herself at Castle Dor. She walked the halls, examining any intriguing paintings or other works of art she came across. Occasionally, she found time to chat with Bragnae, but the elderly maid was usually occupied. When she'd exhausted every corridor of the castle, Fallon took to exploring the grounds and surrounding lands. She surprised herself by how she had fallen into a somewhat pleasant life there. Of course, things never seemed to be simple. She had been expecting her monthly flux over two weeks ago. She was almost never late. It wasn't certain yet, but she knew. Fallon placed a hand on her still flat belly. In her was a king's child. An illegitimate one, but still. If she wasn't so worried she might be excited. But she couldn't stop wondering whether or not Salomon would be happy she was having his child. It would certainly cause somewhat of a disturbance. While Gwen had coldly ignored their affair lately, Fallon couldn't imagine the queen would be able to ignore it when the king's illegitimate child was running around the castle. In fact, Gwen's icy acceptance of her and Salomon's affair was quite unsettling in itself. While the two lovers still made an effort to be discreet, it almost seemed that there was no need. Salomon told Fallon that after a few enraged outbursts when the affair first began, Gwen had stopped referring to his midnight trysts. Fallon was not easily fooled. She still knew she was the object of Gwen's hatred. She could see it in those icy blue eyes whenever they were in a room together. Gwen might pretend to accept that her husband had a mistress, but Fallon felt that a storm was brewing. Salomon did his best to ease her worries, but it was to no avail. And a baby would complicate things much much more. Fallon sighed. There's no use crying over spilt milk . A baby was coming whether they liked it or not, and she was telling Salomon about it tonight. He had asked to meet her expecting a passionate night with nothing on his mind but love making. She almost smiled as she thought, He's in for a surprise. Salomon blissfully made his way down into the depths of Castle Dor to the trapdoor that led him to his and Fallon's meeting place. It had been almost a week since he had been alone with her, and it was killing him. Tonight was much needed, for both of them. He had seen the tightness around Fallon's eyes, how her mouth seemed rather downturned lately. She was… stressed or upset about… something. It was probably the stress of being a king's mistress. As it did so often, guilt twisted his stomach. Fallon would ever be labeled as a king's whore because of him. He gritted his teeth in anger just thinking about what people were probably saying about her already. They had talked about it before, and she assured him she was fine, but still he worried. He hated that his love might be causing her grief. He would ask her about it tonight. But first he would take her in his arms and kiss all her worries away. He grinned when he found her waiting for him beyond the trap door. Fallon returned his smile, but he saw the shadow of worry in her eyes. \"Fallon,\" he said, taking her into his arms and kissing her brow, \"I've missed you.\" \"I've missed you too, Salomon,\" she murmured as she wrapped her arms around his waist. She leaned her head against his chest and sighed. He felt her body sag as if there was a heavy weight upon her, and his brow furrowed in confusion. This was not the reaction he'd expected from her at this meeting. \"Fallon?\" he questioned, \"Are you alright?\" She looked up at him and managed a nervous smile, \"Yes, I'm fine.\" She stepped back and anxiously played with her fingers. He knew she wanted to say more, but she didn't. Salomon chuckled softly. \"Then why are you acting so strangely? You don't expect me to believe that everything is fine when you're acting like this, do you?\" Fallon smiled. \"No, I guess not….\" \"Well?\" \"Well….\" She grimaced, searching for words. Salomon was becoming as anxious as she was. \"I… have something to tell you…. It's not that it's awful…. Well, it's just that…. Circumstances being as they are….\" He quickly covered her mouth with a kiss. \"Now,\" he breathed when he finally pulled away from her, \"Please calm down and just tell me what's wrong.\" Fallon sighed heavily and nodded. \"Well, Salomon, the thing is… I believe I'm with child.\" Salomon opened his mouth to speak then closed it… then opened it again… and closed it. He didn't quite know what to say… or think, or feel. On one hand he was overjoyed. Fallon was going to have his child. He was going to be a father. He loved Fallon deeply and their child would be perfect. On the other hand, however, he was king and married to another woman. This child wouldn't be respected as a king's child should be. It would be viewed as a bastard. Nothing more. And gossip would be rampant in the castle when Fallon's belly began to grow. Gwen would be furious. That almost made him smile. \"My love,\" He finally whispered, wrapping her in a warm embrace, \"Nothing would make me happier than to have a child with you.\" It wasn't a lie. If circumstances were different, nothing would stop him from shouting his joy all throughout Cornwall. If only. But he wouldn't let her see his sadness. \"I am glad it's you who will bear my first child.\" Miles away in Ireland, Lord Cynyr Ceinfarfog was at the docks preparing to board his ships with his men. It was time that Salomon of Cornwall was taught a lesson. ","Summary":" A/N- Hi everyone! Okay, I know you might be thinking, \"This story looks familiar…\" Well, that's b"},{"Movie":"Wild Child","Title":"Leaving Home (And Geting Back Again)","Author":"BringOnTheWonder1997","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9062123","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This will be a series of short one-shots set through the film and probably slightly after, definitely into the post-credits scene x Please read and review x She knows she is damaged. She will admit that, if only to herself, but it's not like she'll let anyone else so much as think it. So she covers it up and knows she goes too far sometimes but at least they ate thinking 'where did her father go wrong with raising her?', followed by a pang of pity and sympathy, than how screwed up she is. She prefers it that way. She is honestly surprised though by her father's decision to send her to England. He's been threatening it for so long now she'd stopped believing it when he'd said it. Only this time it seems to be for real. This time her father seems to have well and truly lost his patience with her. Which had been the aim of her little stunt anyway. So why did it feel do wrong? She couldn't get the unsettling feeling out of her head as she packed, even after Ruby came over to say goodbye and help. To distract herself she decided to look up the school, all red brick and ancient. She didn't think she'd ever so much as stepped foot in a building as old. After all there weren't exactly many Malibu shopping malls that looked like that around. The day she'd left had been hard. Ruby had dropped by in the morning, tearful and wearing the shoes Poppy had given her. They hugged and Ruby was gone within ten minutes. Molly had clung to her, tight as a limpet, looking far too young for her age. Poppy felt a brief spurt of worry, not knowing how her sister would be able to stand up for herself without her around. But Molly would be alright. She was strong - far stronger than Poppy. She was an awful lot less messed up in the head as well. Even Poppy could see that - and she didn't need a therapist to tell her. Her father was coming to England with her. She suspected it was more for the business he had in mind than actually wanting to see her off. She refused to speak to him at all on the plane. The journey had been tense and restless, neither of them knowing quite what to say to the other and neither of them open enough to express their feelings in public. She would be fine, she told herself. She would be out of there in no time. If the father who professed to love her so much couldn't even best to keep her around, what chance did this posh school have? They'd probably be begging her to leave by the end of the month. And then she could go home, with Molly and Ruby. After she was home she'd never speak to her father again. But only once she was home. In the meantime she kind of needed him to get there.[Chapter 2] Sorry this one is so much shorter :) Please read and review x When she gets to the school it's just as bad as she'd imagined. It's all red brick and hedges and gravel on the driveways. It's the kind of place she sees on old British films, the kind where she switches the channel or leaves the room as soon as it comes on. Only she can't switch this channel and walking in that grass will only ruin her shoes. God knows she's already had to rescue most of them by donating them to Molly and Ruby. So it looks like - for now - she's going to have to stay. But that doesn't mean she'll like it - and God knows she'll let them know that. She'll let all of them know that very well, with as much humiliation as possible. Sadly the beginning of her revenge plan falls flat, her clothes ruined in this horrible English weather and at least two of her bottles of beer smashed, leaking into her cashmere sweater. That bit has failed then - she hoped to shock them. If they were half as bad as her father, they would've heard multiple stereotypes about Americans that she wished to prove right, just to annoy them. Well then. She's going to have to get creative. This will be fun...[Chapter 3] She's surprised that she gets along with the other girls in her room. She's never shared before, not unless it was a sleepover, and she hadn't exactly expected to get on with these four girls who are so different from her. They are from different worlds, where she dyes her hair blonde and flaunts the dress code and they attempt to stop her. But no matter their differences, they seem to support her decision to want to get out of here and they are willing to help her. She's only had to be a complete prat to get there with their help. It seems to have been worth it. After all the other students seem perfectly accepting on her and the only ones she really needed to get on with were her roommates (done) and the Head Girl (so far from done its funny). She feels slightly ashamed, because she knows that her own friends wouldn't be as generous to a stranger in their group. They would probably have teased them mercilessly until even fresher meat came along. But these girls don't. They help her dye the school pool purple and publicly humiliate the French teacher and swap things and colour code things just to annoy people. And she's the only one to get caught. They moan about Harriet with her, and come up with wilder and stranger ideas to kick her out, some of which she doesn't think are actually legal. They sound fun either way. These girls are becoming her friends, proper friends. The kind of friends she actually felt she could tell anything to, to be honest with. She thinks she'll miss them when she leaves. She'll have to make sure that she texts them after she's gone.[Chapter 4] And here's Freddie... Please read and review :) And then there's Freddie. He'd started off being her ticket out of here, after every other method had failed. But then he'd become someone real, someone funny and dependable, the kind of guy she'd never had before. All the rest of the guys she'd dated were jerks and expected her to sleep with him. They expected things from her that she didn't want to offer and spent their lives bragging to their friends about what they had done with this girl and that girl, not caring about the girl herself. Well, not Freddie. She was done with them. Freddie was sweet. And she liked it - and she liked him. He was nice and adorable and so bloody English . This would be so much easier if he had acne or awful hair or terrible teeth. Instead he was almost too perfect, the kind of dream guy where if she blinked she knew she would wake up. Girls like her didn't get to keep boys like Freddie. She was too screwed up for it. Poppy didn't know if she wanted to leave anymore, never mind use him to get there. She couldn't break his heart and she didn't want to, not like she'd first planned. She didn't want to leave him - any of them - behind. Going home suddenly seemed like a bad idea. And how she was going to get there seemed even worse.[Chapter 5] There is an email. It's something she hasn't written but looks like something she might have one wrote. And her friends know that. And because of that they believe what is written. They believe that she thinks that they are stupid and boring and every other horrible thing she can think of. They think she wrote those things. Freddie thinks she wrote those things. And what with the fire and the implications that that has, she honestly can't muster up the energy to change their minds. They have made their decision - to not listen to her, to not hear her explanations. They don't believe in her. She supposes that this is what she gets for letting someone through her walls, but she can't fault it because she enjoyed it while it lasted. It's only now that it's ended that it hurts, and even so she wouldn't trade those memories for anything. She is going to Honour Court tomorrow and she already knows how that will end and her heart breaks at the thought of it. Isn't it odd how fast the wind can change? Because she spent the first half of the year trying to get out of this school and now that she knows she'll be leaving, she can't bear the thought of going.[Chapter 6] The Honour Court starts off exactly how she thought it would and then veers abruptly off course. It starts with Harriet going ballistic on her, and making herself sound stupid in the process and Mrs Kingsley trying to calm everyone down, even though she's got to be understandably annoyed with Poppy for apparently toying with her son's heart. It ends with her friends, or at least she thinks they are, starting to suddenly stand up for her - quite literally - and the rest of the school seems to follow in their example. To make everything even better, Harriet had been so annoyed that she'd exposed herself as the actual arsonist. Poppy very much doubts that Harriet will be around for much longer, because that is the first time she's actually seen Mrs Kingsley angry before - with Poppy she's always been sad, disappointed and slightly exasperated. And Poppy was staying. She was staying at Abbey Mount because she was innocent and somehow her friends knew that she hadn't sent those horrible emails. She had friends, proper friends, who believed her enough though all the evidence was stacked against her. She had people who cared. She had Mrs Kingsley. She had the girls. And she might even have Freddie, if he heard the results of the Honour Court. She had a home - she was already there. And she was so glad that she didn't have to leave.[Chapter 7] When her father turns up to watch her lacrosse match, she doesn't know what to think. Sure, he abandoned her here, but it was the best decision of his life, because she l oves it here. He knew she would love it here. He'd known that her mother had gone here. He had done it for her, and it had turned out well , so she decided she was going to even bother holding a grudge. She ran up to him and hugged him, like she hadn't done since she was a little girl, because it America it wasn't cool, wasn't what the popular kids did. She didn't care here because they liked her anyway. She was glad he was here, because she'd missed him (and Molly), even when she hadn't wanted to admit it to herself, and because she hadn't had the chance to apologise for what she had done on the cliff - not that she'd wanted to before. But still, she was sad he was here because her first thought was that he was here to take her back home, and she didn't want to go because she was already there . Why would she want to leave? Poppy hoped her father wouldn't make her - and wasn't that a complete change of heart?[Chapter 8] In the end, she goes back to Malibu with her father, because she knows it isn't for good. It's just the holiday she needs, some sun and a decent tan. Her dad makes everything better by letting her invite her friends though. She can't wait, all five of them on sun loungers, sitting by the pool, seeing how the other half of the world lives when there's much less rain. It turns out that Freddie is coming too. After all this time, being unable to fraternise with the girls, and Mrs Kingsley decides that Poppy Moore is the girl she can trust with her son. She must be mad. But Poppy already knows that - the headmistress had let her stay, even after some of the pranks she'd pulled. She can't wait to be back in Malibu, as long as they're coming with her. She wants to see Molly, because they haven't spoken properly since she was packed off to England, and Poppy wants to surprise her with how much she's changed. That will be easy. She wants her friends to meet her little sister too, and to apologise to her dad's girlfriend for everything, even though she still doesn't really like her. But still, you can't have everything in the world, can you?[Chapter 9] Her friends enjoy Malibu - it's sunny, with not a rain cloud in sight, very different to the dreary English weather. Even Poppy has missed getting a tan. And seeing Freddie in nothing but swimming trunks... Even her friends had been drooling, and they were the ones who knew that Freddie had been taken. Poppy was surprised that her dad let all of them stay in the house, what with a teenage boy around his teenage daughter, but then again her father had always been pretty laid back. It was how she'd gotten away with most of the tricks she'd pulled before the pool thing. And step-mum still doesn't like her for that. But still, the holiday is nice while it lasts and she enjoys seeing her father and Molly again. The pair of them seem equally delighted and bewildered at Poppy's complete change in attitude, but don't comment. Poppy has decided that she might be screwed up, and showing that doesn't make her weak. Like Kate says, it makes her normal. And no matter how good the holiday is, she's going back to Abbey Mount after the summer ends - and maybe even before. And this time she can't wait to get there.

It was September and the weather was crisp and mildly bitter but that didn't stop all the younger girls from running round and acting in an excited manner. In the car was 2 women, well one women and a young lady. The older woman had silvery blonde hair in a straight Bob, hazel eyes and was dressed in a formal grey body-con dress with black fashion blazer and black stilettos. She had a classy amount of make up and jewellery on; she was obviously a very stylish woman. The girl sat next to her very similar in her features she had very fine silvery blonde hair that fell in natural waves to her mid-ribs and had hazel eyes too. Her hair was parted centrally but in a cute messy fashion on her head that have her a pretty, slightly wind swept look. She was had quite a unique style, very different to the women she was with. She was wearing baggy, short, light blue denim dungarees, a white crop t-shirt underneath with a graphic of birds, a bird cage and tea cup printed on the front in pastel shades. She had black thin dernier tights on and red Doc Martins in patent leather. She had a light purple choker around her neck and fabric bracelets stacked around her tiny wrists. \"Darling, you know I'd never send you here if I didn't have the choice\" the older woman began, capturing the girl's face in her hands and kissing her forehead. \"I know mum, it's alright. I'm sure I'll make friends\" the girl replied they were both obviously English. \"Oh Tee\" the girl's mother sighed, embracing her daughter before a sharp wrap on the window drew them apart. There stood a brunette woman with a sense of authority about her. The girl pushed the button that lowers the window and the woman spoke: \"Hello, you must be Tegan. Welcome to Abbey Mount, I'm Mrs Kingsley your headmistress\" the woman smiled \"Hi, yeah I'm Tegan. Tegan Wills\" the girl, Tegan, replied \"And I'm her mum, Jessica\" Tegan's mum leant across. Soon enough both Tegan and Jessica were out the car unloading Tegan's things while Mrs Kingsley helped occasionally, making small conversation. The headmistress learnt that Jessica had only sent Tegan to Abbey Mount as she had been given a promotion that meant she worked abroad for 9 months a year but was astronomically well paid. She also learnt Tegan was a gifted artist, whether it be plain and simple drawing or intricate costume design, she excelled. Similarly Tegan was born on Valentines Day, her favourite colour was cherry red, she lived in the seaside town of Scarborough her whole life until now and she had a fat ginger cat called Baggins. Mrs Kingsley then noticed another car pull up, it had an American number plate so she assumed it was the other new student, a Miss Poppy Moore. \"Tegan if you'd be so kind as to follow me?\" She asked and Tegan nodded saying goodbye to her mum as she scurried after the headmistress. She followed the older woman through crowds of students, one being another blonde girl who was dressed in the uniform. \"Alright Kate?\" Mrs Kingsley asked and the girl said a 'yes, thank you' in a soft voice. They carried on weaving through the masses of girls and their parents and soon enough they arrived right outside the car just as a middle aged man got out. \"Mr Moore? I'm Mrs Kingsley\" Mrs Kingsley introduced herself as Tegan loitered awkwardly in the background. She scanned around her and saw her mum trying to get her things into the building but was failing miserably until an woman dressed in jogging bottoms and vest top, who looked like a teacher, came over to help her out. \"Please call me Gerry and thank you I am so, erm, er … grateful\" Tegan came to realise he was American as he spoke and shook Mrs Kingsley's offered hand. \"I'm happy we could help out\" was Mrs Kingsley's reply \"She er, going through rather a difficult stage\" Mr Moore or Gerry crossed his arms and Mrs Kingsley merely smirked saying: \"Just leave it to me Mr Moore, I have a double first in difficult\" she then trotted towards the car, Tegan trailing behind her. She watched from a distance as the Headmistress tapped on the window and tired to coax the girl. She heard a comment about nightclubs and negotiation and then heard the door door open so the girl must have clambered out. Tegan turned round to see … herself? The girl in the car, this Poppy Moore, was a dead ringer for her. Exact same hair, body (granted Tegan was about 4/5 inches taller than she was) and facial structure. Tegan's hair was naturally blonde and Poppy's was definitely not. Tegan's hair was wavy and Poppy's was straight and obviously Tegan was English and she assumed Poppy was American but aside from that they could have passed as twins. They were all but carbon copies of each other. The other girl seemed to notice as she let out a shriek of: \"OH MY GOD! SHE'S GOT MY FACE! SHE'S GOT MY FACE! AND MY BODY! SHE'S GOT ME!\" Mrs Kingsley laughed along with Mr Moore at Poppy's outburst. Tegan however was quite a chilled person and it took a lot to rile her so she simply let their identical appearances slide after getting over the initial shock of basically meeting herself. \"Now, now Poppy. She hasn't got your face\" Mrs Kingsley laughed and Tegan soon became aware of the whole school's eyes on them. \"Now Poppy, Tegan this is Kate she'll be your big sister at Abbey Mount. You two'll soon settle in\" Mrs Kingsley continued as she introduced them to the girl they passed earlier before stalking off. \"Hi how do you do?\" Kate asked \"H-\" Tegan began but crisp sweet English voice was drowned out by Poppy's overly sugared, ridiculously whiny American one. \"Actually I already have a sister\" Poppy protested and Kate shrugged it off with a: \"That's obvious and It's just school lingo. I'll be a friend. A helping hand that's all\" \"We're aren't sisters\" Both Poppy and Tegan were quick to correct, in sync. The notion of their simultaneous speaking kind of freaked out Kate. \"We aren't sisters\" Tegan clarified solely, just to reinforce the fact as the united speaking could be seen as them playing a joke. \"Not even related and besides I choose my friends and FYI you don't make the cut\" Poppy added \"I'm sure that comment would sting a lot more if I knew what FYI meant but for the moment lets just pretend it had the desired effect, shall we?\" Kate raised an eyebrow and a bell rung. Kate slowly turned and walked towards a group consisting of a another blonde with frizzy hair and two brunettes. Poppy and Tegan stood awkwardly next to each other, the similar thoughts of 'wouldn't it be awful to be an identical twin?' running through their minds. It was safe to say style wise Tegan and Poppy were different. Poppy was designer and expensive whereas Tegan was more loose and comfortable with a slight Bohemian feel. A tall, broad blonde girl with pheasants slung over her shoulder approached them, two lackies - a small red head and a model worthy brunette behind her. At first the blonde girl spoke in a foreign language and Tegan was sure she heard her say 'who Ella novella' but that couldn't be right, surely? She pondered so waited until she (hopefully) translated for them. Well she assumed them but, hey, maybe Poppy spoke whatever the other girl just spoke, the world's full of surprises as Tegan was experiencing right now as she stood beside her doppelgänger who she had no idea existed until now. \"Harriet, head girl\" the blonde thrust her hand out in Poppy's direction but Poppy just looked disgusted. \"You shake the hand of the head girl out of respect\" Harriet condescended her before grabbing Poppy's hand and pulling her forward. \"When the head girl had earned my respect then I will shake her hand, bi-atch\" Poppy pulled her hand out of Harriet's grasp. \"I'm sorry?\" Harriet looked confused. This has obviously never happened before, Tegan mused. \"Apology accepted\" was Poppy's response before Harriet's glare turned to fall on Tegan \"You best keep your sister in line or else you'll both be in trouble\" She threatened \"She's not my-\" Tegan and Poppy began at the same time but Harriet whipped around and smacked Poppy in the face with the dead pheasants. Poppy stopped to talking to gasp dramatically while Tegan trailed off with: \" … sister\" as Harriet and the two other girls stalked away. \"I'll see you inside\" Tegan smiled faintly but Poppy completely ignored her. Tegan slowly walked into the school, letting her gaze wander over all the pictures and trophies as well as the interior of the place. It was so old, so classic - it was just beautiful. After asking at reception where she was assigned to sleep she made her way up (with directions the receptionist had given) to her dorm. Knocking, she waited to be called in before opening the door. When she did she saw 4 others girls. Quickly she realised the one was Kate and the other 3 were who she left to talk to. \"Hi, I'm Tegan Wills. I'm your new roommate I guess\" Tegan smiled timidly and other girls just smiled offering waves and friendly 'hellos' and 'hi Tegan's' \"Your in bed number 5\" Kate said pointing to the only unoccupied bed before pointing at each of the others in turn. \"That's Drippy\" \"Hi\" said the fuzzy haired blonde one, quickly followed by: \"Wagon wheel?\" \"Thanks but no thanks\" Tegan smiled shyly \"That's Kiki\" Kate pointed at the girl with black hair and brown eyes who kind of resembled … \"And that's Josie\" Kate finished. Josie also had black hair and brown eyes but she seemed more relaxed and like a joker whereas Kiki seemed to be intellectually gifted. \"Well that's everyone I'll leave you to unpack, your stuff's already been bought up\" Kate motioned to a set of 2 medium purple hard shell cases at the end of bed 5 along with an A1 Art folder that looked to be buldging. Tegan smiled a 'thank you' before going to unpack. She'd just laid out an entirety of 1 suitcase when low and behold … Poppy Moore walked in, bold as brass. \"Excuse me? Hi, erm, I've been assigned this room … you need to leave\" Poppy snapped and like the other 4, Tegan couldn't help the giggle that escaped her lips. \"Oh, wow, communal\" Poppy sounded mildly repulsed as she observed everyone and their things. \"Well it's that sleeping bag on the floor over there or that sleeping bag on the corridor. Abbey Mount was over subscribed but Mrs Kingsley didn't want to disappoint. You drew the short straw\" Josie said matter-of-factly. Poppy just raised her eyebrows before walking over to bed 5. Tegan looked up at her. \"Oh, hi … Tree-grown, wasn't it?\" Poppy asked falsely, it obvious she was up to something when she picked up a top of the top of one Tegan's unpacking piles before dropping it on the floor. \"Oops\" Poppy giggled and Tegan merely rolled her eyes as she clambered off the bed to pick it up. However as soon as Tegan got off, Poppy hopped on, tipping her piles of clothes on to the floor. \"Now who's drawn the short straw? Bi-acth\" she gave Josie a pointed look as Tegan just wordlessly collected her clothes refolding them before crawling over to the sleeping bag and unrolling the hideous blue thing that looked like a polyester cocoon that sat right in between Drippy and Poppy's new bed, directly under the window. \"Hey!-\" Josie began to protest but Tegan put a hand up to say it was ok \"I don't mind sleeping on the floor and besides it'll do wonders for posture - no more bad backs for me\" Tegan smiled until everyone was convinced she didn't mind, which she didn't. Tegan saw it as lucky they'd allowed her into the school anyway as she was close to finishing her school life and the school could have said no because they didn't want to have to ensure her grades were up to standard but they did. She figured she owed them. \"You can share my cupboards\" Drippy offered \"Thanks\" Tegan smiled and to squish her stuff down and place it in the cupboards with Drippy's stuff, trying to take up as little space as possible. \"You lock up your chocolate?\" Poppy asked, looking at Kate who just filled a her beside cupboard full of it but Kate just smiled \"Key information if the Wagon Wheel versus the Rolex the Wagon Wheel is gonna trounce it every time\" Drippy cut it \"What's a Wagon Wheel?\" Poppy pulled a face and Drippy looked shocked \"Jesu Christi, you have not lived!\" She ran to Poppy, Wagon Wheel in hand and all but threw it at her in excitement. Poppy took it, albeit handling it like it was poison, and grimaced before rather rudely saying: \"Ew, that's carbs and sugar\" \"What a revelation, I had no idea\" Drippy snatched it back and Poppy just pulled a face. Tegan continued to unpack and arrange her stuff on her makeshift bedside cabinet of the windowsill until Poppy came and stood on her sleeping bag, dirty shoes all over it, as she tried to find a signal \"What the bleep is that?\" Josie asked \"None of you bleeping business\" was Poppy sole retort \"It's an iPhone, good luck getting a signal we only have two hot spots that work round here\" Kiki chipped in. \"Maybe you should try entering the 21st century Buck Rodgers\" Poppy snapped and Kiki looked none fussed as Poppy continued to rant: \"This place it Medieval! It's imperative that I make my phone calls\" As she flounced back to her bed \"It's pointless anyway. We're only allowed mobiles on weekends\" Kate explained, folding some of her clothes. \"How am I supposed to call my therapist?\" Poppy asked deadly seriously, evoking more giggles from the other girls out of disbelief. \"She's joking right?\" Josie asked, sharing a look with a chuckling Drippy and Kiki and Tegan who merely shrugged while raising a pale arched eyebrow \"Oh, sweetheart. This isn't Beverly Hills 90210\" Josie added, evoking a huff from Poppy \"Just put it away before Matron catches you. Where's your trunk?\" Kate tried to change the subject \"It hasn't been delivered yet\" Poppy moped, whipping round to wallow in self pity on her bed while the other girls shared glances. Kate, Josie, Kiki, Drippy and Tegan's eyes all connected at least once before they all jumped to their feet and sprinted out the room, down the stairs, through the school and out to front entrance. \"Oh my god! It's chucking it down!\" Josie cried as they opened the door \"Come on!\" Tegan pushed her way through and sprinted out into the rain, the others (minus Drippy who waited in the door way) following behind her. Soon enough they reached Poppy's bright pink trunk. It was drenched, water was clearly seeping through in to the insides and it was slippery because of the wet making it difficult to grasp. \"Hey, why did you ru - OH MY GOD!\" Poppy's shrieked and ran to help them. Between them they managed to grapple Poppy's heavy water logged trunk and lug it inside. They dropped it on the dorm floor with a 'thud' . All of them, with the exception of Drippy, were soaked to the bone. Their clothes sticking to them, hair all in clumpy strands and goose bumped. Poppy threw herself down next to her trunk in a dramatic fashion. She unlatched the fastens, flinging it open. Carnage. Was the word that sprung to Tegan's mind. The entirety of her clothes were ruined. \"Oh … no\" Poppy mewled as Josie and Kiki lifted the first section out while she and Kate sat on either side of Poppy as she fondled a shoe. Drippy watched from a distance on the other side of the trunk, perched on her bed \"Oh … no, no, no … no\" Poppy continued as Kiki and Josie lifted the dripping upper section over the trunk and placed it on the floor \"Ergh\" Drippy scrunched up her nose \"No, no … not the new season Gucci … no … the Choo's … No!\" Poppy cried pouring a small fountain out of a red heeled shoe while Kate and Tegan set to work drain in the shoes and matching them up. \"This is all only hand washable! This is ridiculous\" Poppy chastised before pulling out a bottle of champagne \"Erm, why?\" Kate began, looking at the multiple bottles of champagne hidden under Poppy's shoes as well as the one in her hand. \"What I might get thirsty?\" Poppy defended. As Josie and Kiki returned to stand by the trunk \"You know in the UK we have this magical invention from a mythical land, only ever witnessed by brave leprechauns who took on a life at sea in the 13th century … it's called a tap\" Tegan changed her voice from dreamy and story teller like to a flat lined tone. The door flew open and harsh looking entered. She had black hair that was tightly tied back, skin as white as a ghost's and a stick thin body with no shape that was clad in a very 1960's public school teacher style dress with an awful dreary pattern on it to match. \"Welcome back, girls\" her Scottish accented drawled. Poppy rang out a top before addressing the woman: \"Oh good, staff. How quickly can you get all this stuff cleaned?\" Poppy asked and Tegan became aware that everyone had stood and it was just her and Poppy sat by her trunk. 'Here comes the sister error\" she thought irritably. \"Are they?\" The woman, who Tegan assumed to Matron, asked Josie \"The on in pink yes, dungarees no. Poppy's American\" Josie replied \"Erm, yes we had one of those in 1997 - not good\" matron thought aloud as Poppy continued to claw at her clothes hoping the water would magically disappear as Tegan just awkwardly sat their. \"Accustom her to my rules and she, no, they should be the correct uniform for a start. Mobile phones please girls\" Matron snapped and Tegan got to her feet and walked over to her windowsill and picked up her phone, putting it on the tray after Drippy. \"And you are?\" Matron scowled at her \"Tegan Wills, Miss.\" \"We'll Miss Wills if you could straighten out your relative it would be most appreciated\" \"Erm, Poppy and I were not related\" \"Nonsense, if it wasn't for the vary in accent I'd have said you were twins\" \"No Miss, were actually not. We only met for the first time a few hours ago\" Tegan explained. Matron seemed suspicious but nodded, moving on. \"Thank you Kiki … thank you Josie … thank you Kate\" she then went over to Poppy's bed and picked up the two phones that rested on top of the covers \"Woah, hands off mama! I said hands off! Obla espangol? Porceito Italiano?\" Poppy protested, assuming the matron was foreign while the other girls silently sighed and rolled their eyes \"I am Scottish not remedial\" matron explained \"Good then you understand. Line dry press. No stretch and no creases\" Poppy chucked three sopping wet items of clothing on to the tray for phones. \"How dare you? No MUFTI for a week\" matron glared and stalked away \"Fine, MUFTI may be your thing lady but it sure ain't mine\" Poppy followed \"She means no home clothes for a week\" Kiki explained and Matron stopped, dropping Poppy (who had just moved to stand with Drippy and Tegan) 's clothes on to the floor. \"Like I give a shit? I'll be gone by then anyway\" Poppy shrugged and matron appeared to have a small heart attack \"LANGUAGE! Two Sunday's detention for the whole dorm\" Matron cried and Kate, Kiki, Drippy, Josie and Tegan groaned \"I'll deal with this …\" Poppy reassured before going up to matron: \"Look, hey. Hey! Here's a Ben Franklin why don't you go out and buy yourself … well, anything. Whatever you get will be a serious improvement\" she put the note on the tray \"Three Sunday's for everyone\" matron turned to look at the others who'd clumped together at the end of Poppy's bed. Another collective groan swept through them and matron walked out with a satisfied 'humph'. \"Thanks a lot for that you utter moron\" Josie snapped at Poppy as soon as Matron slammed the door behind her. \"What are you mental?\" Drippy seconded \"What? She was a grade one a-hole, with a severe attitudinal problem!\" Poppy put her hands on her hips. \"The bell's going to go in a minute, put your uniform on … Both of you!\" Kate's voice sounded irritated as she glared at both at Tegan and Poppy. Tegan went back to her stuff and dug out her uniform but Poppy just sighed as the bell rung and the Kate, Drippy, Kiki and Josie yelled in unison: \"NOW!\" As the two were changing Josie, Kiki, Drippy and Kate noticed a huge difference between Tegan and Poppy. Poppy hated being told what to do. Even now she was protesting about putting her uniform on and demanding Kate apologise to her. But Tegan who probably did deserve an apology from Kate, let her rudeness slide and quickly got changed in her navy and ivy tartan check skater school skirt that fell to her lower, mid thigh. A white, 3/4 length sleeve, school blouse which she tucked into aforementioned skirt. Tegan did leave the top button of her shirt undone and her collar was loose but her navy/ivy tie had more than enough stripes even with it's rather large knot. She slipped on a pair grey ankle socks that she then turned over on the tops so the little grey lace trimmings were showing and flat black patent leather shoes with a dainty strap across the foot and a tiny silver buckle before shrugging on her grey blazer with the school's emblem on the right breast. She ran a comb through her drying hair, removing the knots from the damp tendrils as they returned into tousled waves. -line break- The group of six walked down the crowded corridors with girls of all ages pushing and shoving to get where they wanted to be. \"You will never get away with that uniform for a start and FYI no drinking, no smoking, no alcohol. No fireworks, no dangerous weapons, no illegal drugs. If you have a problem with someone no random bitching - structure your point. No web surfing, no bullying. If you two behave like arseholes we all suffer so do not get us in your shit or we will brake you\" Kate explained though Tegan had a feeling that the arsehole comment was made more at Poppy than herself. Poppy and Kate were in front and Tegan and Drippy behind them as they made their way through the school, down a grand staircase and it to the dining hall. \"Ooh, I'm scared\" Poppy sarcastically commented. Once they entered the hall a lot of younger girls made a point to greet gate and many: 'Hi Kate's' and 'Hello Kate's' rippled through out the hall. \"Hello\" Kate replied softly and Poppy just scoffed: \"What are you prom queen or something?\" She asked as the reached Josie and Kiki who were waiting for them to catch up as they stood by a vacant table. \"Kate's got a terrible affliction, you're actually lucky that you don't have it - it's called popularity\" Josie smirked, going to stand on Poppy's right while Kate was on her left and opposite her, from left to right, Tegan, Drippy and Kiki. Poppy rolled her eyes and sat down \"Hey get up, wait for Mrs Kingsley and the prefects\" Kate ordered \"Screw them\" Poppy rolled her eyes and Kate and Josie shared a look before hooking an arm each under Poppy's and hauling her up. Poppy gasped uttering a, very rushed: \"That's physical abuse, I'm calling my lawyer!\" \"With what?\" Kate challenged and Poppy glared. The atmosphere however was suddenly lightened by Drippy \"Well hello, Freddie\" she said and the girls turned to look at a boy who'd just entered. He was tall with a stylish sandy blonde mop head and blue eyes. Despite being dressed quite formally in a classy yet stylish suit it obvious he had a muscular physique. \"How kind of you to grace us with your gorgeous presence\" Drippy continued and Kate checked her watch before saying: \"And que Harriet in 3 … 2 … 1\" looking at her watch as she counted down. Just as predicted, Harriet appeared and started talking to Freddie \"Subject has moved in on target\" Josie piped up and Kiki and Drippy smiled while Poppy and Tegan shared a confused glance. Harriet touched his arm and … \"And we have contact\" Kiki added. Tegan heard to two teachers tell off a girl for running at the far end of the hall but shrugged it off as Mrs Kingsley appeared and rang a little bell and suddenly everyone sat, Tegan followed the flow and sat while Poppy glanced around like a headless chicken before being dragged down to sit by Josie. \"I love that Freddie's always here at the end of term it's such a perfect welcome back\" Drippy gushed and Kate, Josie and Kiki let out giggles of agreement. \"So what's the deal with this Freddie? Who is he and why is he here? I mean this is a girls school\" Tegan asked \"Mrs Kingsley's son\" Drippy explained motioning for them to lean forward so she could whisper. They all did as Drippy explained the story to Tegan and Poppy. \"Devastating heart throb but he won't look at any of us since he was caught playing 'doctors and nurses' with a girl in the third grade when he was 11 … massive hoo-hah, they're not together now\" \"Because of her massive hoo-hah?\" Poppy asked and the others laughed \"No Poppy, hoo-hah is English for scandal\" Tegan explained \"Besides fraternising is forbidden\" Drippy added as a woman came up to the table with a trolley with plates of food on. \"Here you go\" she said passing a plate to Tegan who barley covered her wince as she passed the plate along. \"I can't eat this\" Poppy began before a plate was even set in front of her \"Anorexia or Bulimia? Because if its bulimia we'd rather you didn't eat other people's birthday cake on their birthdays it such a waste\" Drippy emphasised 'such' as the woman with the trolley moved on \"Priorities?\" Tegan breathed out in a joke question, raising a eyebrow. \"Yeah\" Kiki smiled \"Actually I'm a Pescatarian Monday through Wednesday. Fruitarian Thursday through Sunday and Vegetarian always\" Poppy sassily explained \"Oh\" was the only response and it was from Drippy along with the nod of her head. Mrs Kingsley rang her bell again and the hall fell into silence and everyone closed their eyes, clasping their hands in prayer. \"For what we are about to receive, may the Lord … \" the whole school said in unison. However Poppy being American and Tegan who was raised as an atheist had no clue what was going on. They both say there looking round wildly to see if anyone was as lost as them, unfortunately no one was so Poppy kicked Tegan under the table to get her attention and when her living reflection looked back she mouthed: \"What is this?\" \"I don't know\" Tegan mouthed back with a shrug as Poppy began a Buddhist meal time prayer. Everyone stopped saying the normal prayer, opened their eyes and turned to look at Poppy, including the teachers, prefects and Freddie. Poppy opened her eyes to see everyone looking at her and very boldly, with no shame at all went: \"Namaste\" and Tegan broke into a fit of giggles that was also witnessed by everyone as everyone's attention snapped to her before Mrs Kingsley got everyone minus 2 students back together with: \"Amen\" After that the hall began eating and conversations broke out. \"So mum, you have twins this term?\" Freddie Kingsley asked his mother who was opposite him at the head table \"What, darling?\" She asked looking up from her food \"Identical twins over there, blonde girls\" Freddie turned in his seat and gestured with his hand to the table where Kate, Poppy, Josie, Tegan, Drippy and Kiki were all having a good old giggle even if Poppy's did look a little forced. \"Oh, Miss Moore and Miss Wills. Surprisingly no, not twins - not even related\" Mrs Kingsley explained \"Wow, they look well … the same. Who's who?\" Freddie asked, glancing back at them before turning to face his mother who was imitating a meerkat as she shifted in her seat, as if the wiggling would be able to help her, before she sighed and with a sheepish smile admitted: \"No idea\" \"I can tell you Fredster\" Harriet joined the conversation \"The one with the ridiculous designer clothing that looks she stepped right of Malibu has well … stepped right out of Malibu, she's the American\" Harriet stated nonchalantly not turning round \"But Harriet they're both in uniform\" Freddie told her and at this she whipped round to see both girls, who looked the same wearing the same clothes. \"So whose who Harriet?\" Mrs Kingsley teased but she hated being made to look stupid, especially in front of Freddie. Who Harriet had noticed had turned round again and was eyeing the two girls. Suddenly she got a idea, lurching her body down and forward she looked under the tables at the girls' feet. However in doing so her cheek was hovering a mere inch or two above Freddie's crouch and thigh. He gulped and tensed while Mrs Kingsley raised her eyebrows. Not a minute later Harriet popped back up again, Freddie visibly relaxed and Mrs Kingsley still looked shocked. \"The one on the far side is the American she's got tremendously high heeled, not regulation school shoes on. She's tiny the other one in flats is taller\" she smiled like the cat that got the cream before returning to her meal. -line break- Walking through the halls the the girls went in two lines the first being Kiki, Poopy and Kate with Josie, Drippy and Tegan trailing behind them. They (minus Poppy who looked bored stiff and only contributed to the conversation in one word answers or snide remarks) chatted animatedly about something that had gone one in wrong of Kiki's experiments in chemistry class where she nearly blew up the class room. What they didn't notice was Harriet and her brainwashed followers coming before it was too late. All the other students moved for them but Poppy did not, not purposely she just didn't see her coming and when they were toe-to-toe, she refused to move. \"Get out of the way\" Kate hissed pulling her back against the wall, where she fell on Tegan. Poppy's heels now meant they stood at the exact same height so looked even more freakish as the stood like dolls both fresh of the same production line with identical looks of horror plastered across their face, albeit for different reasons. Poppy's because she was moved and Tegan's because Poppy'd walked into Harriet. \"Hey! Watch the S'hmere girlfriend. 200 goats died for this\" Poppy snapped at Kate while Harriet watched on with a face that looked like she had a bad smell under her nose. Once Poppy's attention (and everyone else immediately present) was on her the head girl began: \"We meet again, how sublime. Learn to rules. When it comes to right of way there is a hierarchy: Teachers, Prefects, Scholars, Dogs, Vermin, American look-a-likes … Americans\" Harriet gave a pointed glance at Tegan before continuing. \"Kate, see to she falls in line. Her double doesn't seem to be having so many problems so why should she?\" Harriet asked rhetorically before stalking off, her lackies following her. \"What is this place Hogwarts?\" Tegan quizzed aloud while Poppy ranted \"People round here have a serious issues with this!\" Poppy gestured wildly between herself and Tegan \"We are two separate identities. We are not related and even if we were that wouldn't make us a bundle. People think we come as a package! We don't!\" Poppy cried as the continued to walk to their dorm -line break- The door creaked open and patron came in with a pile of clothes in her hands \"Bed time girls\" she said and walked over to Poppy's bed while the other girls exchanged 'good nights'. Tegan had just wiggled her way into her sleeping bag, pulling the cord so it was tight around her head, like she was in a cocoon when Matron dropped the clothes on Poppy's bed and said: \"The correct school uniform, wear it … bed\" with a snap of her fingers before beginning to walk out as Poppy scoffed and pulled her face when her back was turned. Matron stopped dead in her tracks. \"POPPY MOORE BED, NOW!\" She hollered before storming out and flicking the lights off as Poppy clambered into bed.[Chapter 2] \"Bonnjour les filles\" the French teacher, who Tegan had been told be Kate was called Mr Nellist jovially shouted as he entered the classroom. \"Bonjour Monsieur Nellist\" the class replied in unison as he set his brief case down and moved a chair, raising his leg and leaning his foot on it - highlighting the tightness of his trousers that made Tegan cringe while the majority of the class just quietly laughed \"Translation today everyone so PDF, pretty damn straight forward, er, ergo … which means? Anyone, ergo?\" He asked and a brainwave hit Drippy \"Ooo! Mr Nellist?\" She raised her hand \"Yes, Drippy?\" \"Er-leave\" she moved her hands side ways with the syllables to show continuation and glass giggling amplified a bit \"Luddite …\" Mr Nellist began and Tegan was shocked. Luddite? What kind of inspiration was that? She questioned silently, already decided she did not like this teacher and poor Drippy looked crestfallen \"… it means therefore, Drippy. Therefore you're probably going to finish early that means you'll have lots time to ask me questions on my trip to Champagne with my girlfriend … er, well now sadly my ex-girlfriend … but she was my girlfriend at, at the time\" he trailed off and the class laughter picked up immensely. \"Put your head phones on\" he instructed his voice slightly wavering as he did. The whole class did as they were told. Tegan took great effort not to catch her earrings as she did, she had 3 piercings in the lobes that she always wore her 3 favourite sets in (1st = white flower stud with gold rim and clear diamond in the middle. 2nd = simple gold stud. 3rd clear diamond stud). Today she had also connect gold cuffs, the chains linking each of her three earrings to the decorative piece at the top of her ear on both sides. -line break- Later that day once lessons had finished the girls all returned to their dorm. Drippy had gone off in search of eyebrow tint while the others changed in their pyjamas, washed their face and brushed their teeth. Tegan, having dealt with the hygiene side of things already, changed into a long t-shirt that fell to her mid thighs and a fresh underwear. She brushed her hair and out it up in a pony tail but on the last bobble loop she did not pull it all the way through so her hair was in a big, floppy, looped bun. Drippy soon returned having found eyebrow tint and went to get changed too before washing her face ect … Tegan didn't pay much mind as Drippy exited the bathroom and sat on a chair that had been placed between Kate and Josie's beds, while Kate prepared the eyebrow tint. Josie was laid in bed holding what appeared to be a present while Kiki sat on her bed, applying some form of make up powder. Tegan herself was sat on the opposite side on the room, her bottom half swaddled in her sleeping bag while her back leant against the windowsill and her knees raised so she had a little table. Resting on her knees was her latest drawing pad, she'd only had it a few weeks and it was nearly already full. She had a massive art case full of pencils, crayons, pens, paints and pastels of any type or colour next to her as applied surrealist colours to her sketch of bird flying free from an open cage. Poppy was sat on her side of the room too. Her eyes were closed and she had earphones in as she held UV pads to her face. The music bled out from the earphones and a light buzz filled the room Kate began to start on Drippy's eyebrows and there was silence for a while until Drippy randomly drummed up a conversation. \"Apparently California girls wax their bums\" Josie, Kiki, Tegan and Kate all turned to look at Drippy with scrunched up faces of confusion and slight disgust \"What, why?\" Kate's voice gave away her thoughts on the topic, she sounded very creeped out. \"To look Brazilian. It makes them look more attractive\" Drippy responded and Tegan rolled and her eyes and smiles slightly, going back to her drawing \"If you say so\" Kate shrugged continuing with Drippy's eyebrows before adding: \"Do you think she's done … it\" Kate couldn't think of a better word. \"100% she's definitely done the missionary and almost certainly the lebonese falcrum, I can tell\" Drippy shrugged while others looked at her with wide eyes, even Tegan looked back up from her drawing, her eyes inflating to the size of saucers. \"How?\" Asked Kate \"From the angle of her hips\" Drippy stated and the four girls opposite Poppy tilted their head to look while Tegan merely judged their reactions. Suddenly Poppy pulled out her one of her earphones, whipping round to ask: \"Can I help you? … is there a problem?\" While Kate, Drippy, Josie and Kiki's returned to a normal position \"How many boys have you shagged?\" Drippy just threw it out their and Poppy just stood from the bed turning to face them and occasionally glancing across to look at Tegan. \"Well, there was Brandon - 8 pack. Chase, jock. Tyler, bigilloanaire. Derek - he was Kelly Slater's cousin and erm, oh … Jack. He was all around sick\" Poppy explained \"Christ!\" Josie exclaimed \"I mean sick body, sick mind\" Poppy contemplated \"Ew, gross!\" Tegan shuddered and Drippy let out a massive gasp as she held the hand mirror over her face. \"SHIT! KATE!\" \"Sorry, Drippy! It looked lighter on the box!\" Kate apologised, while Poppy, Josie and Kiki began to snicker. Drippy stomped back to her bed before flopping down, mirror in hand. She got comfy and began to examine her eyebrows even more. \"That is Butters. It's better not stop me pulling at the social\" Drippy sighed as the school bell, signalling bed began. \"Honey, eyebrows are the least of your worries\" came the words of wisdom from Poppy. \"They look fine, Drippy. They're really not that bad\" Tegan consoled. The door flung open and in came matron \"Lights out girls, everyone in to bed\" she ordered. Everyone began putting whatever they had out away and turning of beside lamps. Tegan shut her art case and rested her sketch book, still open on the page, on top of it. She then wriggled down in to the sleeping bag and flicking the off switch on her only light source, her lava lamp. The windowsill had to house many things of the other girls, as well as her own stuff, so an actual lamp was too big. \"Night matron\" Kiki called while Drippy still groaned about her eyebrows. The lights were flicked off and the door shut. The room was immersed in darkness for less than a second before a bright light shone from Poppy's side of the room. She was on her laptop \"Hey, turn that off!\" Kiki hissed \"No, wireless. Should've known\" Poppy slammed the lid down and getting out of bed \"Internet is only allowed in the computer room\" Kiki said very matter-of-factly. \"Woah, we are not allowed out of bed after lights out!\" Josie protested, seeing Poppy walk towards the door. \"Oh, look … there not out\" Poppy flicked the lights on and everyone groaned at the sudden brightness \"Hey!\" Drippy called \"The light, it burns\" Tegan hissed, earning a laugh from Kate, Drippy, Kiki and Josie but a exasperated sigh and roll of the eyes from Poppy. Tegan moved her whole body so she was lying on her front, the bottom of the sleeping bag on top to block out the light. \"What are you doing, come back here?\" Kate demanded as Poppy left the room. \"At least turn the light off!\" Josie shouted but Poppy slammed the door. \"Bitch\" Drippy muttered \"Tell me about\" Josie agreed \"Who do you think she's trying to contact anyway?\" Kate asked \"Probably her therapist so she can get through another day of torture with her hideous English roommates\" Kiki proposed and collective mulling of agreement rang through the room. \"If I were you Tee, I'd jump in her bed now she's gone, it can't be no fun sleeping on the floor\" Josie said \"I canna be arsed\" was the mumbled response from Tegan whose face was still towards the floor. Her comment and its delivery evoked more laughter from the girls. Before Kate said: \"Drippy, turn off the light\" \"What? Why me?\" \"You're closest\" \"I'm the same distance away from the lights as Kiki\" \"Bagsie not me\" Kiki rushed to say \"Bagsie not me either!\" Josie interjected \"Bag-\" Kate and Drippy began at the same time \"Blimey you lot. How hard is it? I'll do it!\" Tegan said flipping over in her sleep bag before slowly getting to her feet and hopping along in her artificial chrysalis to the lights while the others laughed. \"Jesus, if there's ever a fire I'm doomed! I mean at this pace I'd be a walking, well, hopping fireball inferno before I reached the end of the corridor\" Tegan joked as she flicked off the light and the room was plunged in to darkness and like that darkness was magical, silence took over the room. The natural blonde and the nicer of the two copies began jumping back to her window spot, which was a lot more difficult in the dark. \"Oh, Tee! Shut up, will you? Some of us are trying to sleep\" Josie joked, throwing a cushion at her and they all laughed \"Oh hush you\" Tegan ordered as she found her spot and laid down again. She shut her eyes and listened to the breathing of her roommates slow until sleep consumed her. -line break- A loud, harsh, ringing snapped Tegan from her sleep. She was vaguely aware of Drippy in the door way yelling about a fire drill as she sat up. Kate and Kiki were just coming round and Josie was still flat out when matron charged into the room. \"Get up, come on! Fire practice!\" She bellowed. Tegan rolled her eyes and began detangling herself from the sleeping bag as matron continued to yell. By now Kate was up and Drippy was dragging Kiki out of bed as Matron stood at the end of Josie's and all but hollered in her ear \"GET UP! FIRE PRACTICE! \"I'M UP!\" Josie sprung to life, sitting up like a coiled spring making matron jump. Tegan pulled on her pair of slippers that were like flat shoes made out wool in a cute pattern with a pom-pom on the front and white plastic external soles. Matron quickly ushered them out the room. \"COME ON GIRLS!\" Kate and Kiki left first then Josie then Drippy and Tegan \"Hey erm, Drippy … you've, er, got ice cream or something round you mouth\" Tegan smiled awkwardly while Drippy flushed red and wiped her mouth quickly \"FIRE PRACTICE! GIRLS MOVE NOW!\" Matron yelled in their ears making them jump and quickly run down the corridor and begin to speedily descend the stairs. Abruptly though Tegan stopped, causing Drippy and Matron to look at her \"Where's Poppy?\" Tegan asked and Matron became red before turning on her heel and stomping up the stairs \"POPPY MOORE!\" -line break- Poppy skid to a stop at the corridor where her dorm was, to find matron yelling in Drippy and Tegan's ears \"FIRE PRACTICE! GIRLS MOVE NOW!\" They jumped and quickly run down the corridor towards the stairs. Poppy heard the pitter patter of their feet and Matron's heavy stomping against the wood floors \"Where's Poppy?\" She heard Tegan ask \"Oh, shit … ah\" Poppy waved her hands in distress \"POPPY MOORE!\" Matron hollered her footsteps hastily returning. Poppy saw an open window and decided it was worth taking the risk. She climbed out shakily and slowly manoeuvred her way across the slippy roof top. She quickly found herself in a situation where she a) waited to be inevitably found b) jump off the roof and most likely die or c) climb the foul, slimy ladder that was covering in moss. Poppy reluctantly went for option C. Pinching the ladder she let out a disgusted: \"Ew\" before climbing it. \"COME ON GIRLS HURRY UP! WHAT IF THEIR WAS A REAL FIRE? YOU'D HAVE BEEN BURNED TO A CRISP\" Matron yelled just as Poppy got to the top of the ladder and peered over a little decorative ridge on the roof that hid her well. Poppy rolled her eyes before slowly standing and moving on again. She ended up by a closed window and an open window with ladder like steps leading up to it. She decided needs must and climbed the strange steps before slipping through the open window. Once through Poppy found herself in a bathroom. The bathroom was very feminine but more worryingly the water of the shower was running and the shower curtain was drawn around the bath. Poppy tried to make a quick dash for it but obviously wasn't stealthy enough. \"Hey, who's there?\" A male voice rang out as the water was turned off and Poppy froze. \"Er … Tegan\" Poppy wasn't even sure why she did it but it just slipped out. Her subconscious figured if she was seen by a teacher she was convinced she didn't have, having never heard his voice before, introducing herself as her doppelgänger would keep her out of trouble. \"Last name?\" The teacher asked \"Erm, Tegan's last name … Er, Walls, Wells - Wills!\" Poppy muttered under breath so he couldn't hear once she realised she didn't actually know her double and roommate of two weeks last name. \"Wills. Tegan Wills … Sir\" Poppy said more confidently but still quite unsure \"Well, Wills. Tegan Wills. This is a fire practice\" \"Sorry I - I'm new here\" \"Yes that's obvious but weren't you listening in psychics class? Fire tends to be hot and the point is to avoid it\" \"Ok, where do I go?\" Poppy asked now kind of unnerved. She assumed his defensive behaviour of the psychics topic made him most likely to be a psychics teacher \"Out the door, turn left and down the stairs\" \"Run towards the bright, orange, flickery thing, right?\" She asked sarcastically on her way to the door. \"Oh and try not to get caught\" the teacher's voice said just as she reached the door \"Excellent point, sir\" Poppy said opening the door and slipping out. However what Poppy did not know was that the mirror above the sink next to the bath reflected partially on to a tiny hand mirror on a little bath rack in the bath with the teacher in. He'd saw who'd claimed to be Tegan Wills and although not knowing it yet would soon discover both who Poppy and Tegan really were.[Chapter 3] The next day was PE a subject that both Poppy and Tegan hated so they were both glad their teacher, a Ms Rees-Withers, who'd helped Tegan's mum carry her stuff on the first day let them sit out so they could see exactly what LaCrosse encountered. They were both stood as the watched the girls do their warm up. Today they looked more alike than ever as Poppy couldn't really modify her sports uniform so the both stood their in light blue polo shirts, navy cotton shirts that fell to their mid thighs and black canvas pumps with black laces over black sports knee socks. Poppy had her straight hair in to two loose bunches, secured by pink bobbles and her fringe pinned back. Tegan however had her wavy hair in two loose messy plaits (well as messy as small amounts of fine hair plaited could be) fastened with blonde bobbles and her side parted feathered fringe falling in delicate waves, framing her face. \"Lovely Harriet\" Ms Rees-Withers as she jogged to stand by the the two \"Do twin A and twin B get it yet?\" She asked standing between the natural and bottle blonde who both turned to glare at her and said simultaneously: \"We. Are. Not. Twins\" \"Or sisters\" Tegan added \"Or even related at all\" Poppy finished \"Oh my! Poppy look!\" Tegan said and Poppy did as she was told just as Mr Nellist dressed in the tiniest, tightest work out shorts and jacket you'd ever seen speed walked round one of the far hedges. \"Ew! That's is so … well it's not even last season it's more last century!\" Poppy cried The girls ran past again and mud splattered up. Tegan managed to dodge it but it caught Poppy's cheek, who obviously reacted like she'd been shot. \"Ew!\" She cried pulling out her hand sanitizer and squirting a liberal amount on her hands, rubbing it in and then applying it to her face. \"Crack on team\" Ms Rees-Withers danced on her spot as Harriet led the warm up line back towards them, LaCrosse stick raised above her head. \"Lovely stick work Harriet\" Ms Rees-Withers praised and Mr Nellist and his squeaky shoes and jelly legs walked past, waving \"Hello Mr Nellist\" Ms Rees-Withers acknowledged him and Poppy and Tegan shared a look and small smile at the awkward and obvious flirting. The class all sat on the grass in front of the 3, slightly huffing and puffing. \"Finito? Well a super super effort. We may not win the championships but we'll win a lot of friends? Yeah?\" Ms Rees-Withers tried to sugar coat their class' inability as Harriet and her lackies, Jane and Charlotte, stretched. \"So bloody English\" Poppy rolled her eyes \"Hahaha, really? And you could do better?\" Harriet jibed \"Laugh it up. But I could whip all your asses blindfolded\" \"This I'd love to see\" Harriet challenged and Poppy knelt down picking up her LaCrosse stick before straightening up with a: \"Oh, it's on like Donkey Kong. Do your worst, Horse face\" -line break- A Mexican stand off was occurring or at least that's how Tegan saw it. The class had moved to sit far back and Ms Rees-Withers had just placed a yellow foam ball onto the grass before returning to stand next to Tegan while Poppy and Harriet stood equal distances from the ball, glaring at one and other. Harriet scuffed her feet on the ground like an angry bull while Poppy bounced around like a boxer while she removed the plastic wrapping from the LaCrosse stick. Ms Rees-Withers blew her whistle and their was a whiny battle cry and a squealing battle cry - it was hard to tell whose belonged to who. Soon enough Poppy and Harriet were charging a each other. Upon reaching the ball the both completely ignored it and knocked the others legs from under them. They then started hitting each other with all their might. Ms Rees-Withers began to blow her whistle frantically but neither girl stopped as they delivered bruise inducing and bruise inducing hit. Harriet delivered a particularly hard strike to Poppy's head, so hard Tegan heard it and that's when she intervened. Tegan waded into the the sparring girls trying to brake them up. Tegan found as soon as pushed one away the other would come lurched forward in attack. She ended up just stood, hunched over, pushing Poppy's shoulders, then Harriet's, then Poppy's and then Harriet's and so on but she was still doing a better job than Ms Rees-Withers, who'd all but given up. A sound of a car pulling up was hardly heard over the whistling and the screaming and grunting. Only until the driver peeped the horn several times before anyone noticed their, his, arrival. Harriet and Poppy stopped fighting and Tegan used all her 5' 8\" might to drag, 5' 3\" Poppy and the hulking 5' 11\" Harriet off the ground. All three of them turned to see Mrs Kingsley son, Freddie in a vintage car. \"Shouldn't you guys be in bikinis for that?\" He remarked cheekily. \"Hi Fredster! Dig the car\" Harriet put her hands on her hips and Freddie revved up a little. Instead of answering her though he turned to Poppy and said: \"Hello, Wills. Tegan Wills\" Poppy looked as confused as Tegan felt. \"Hi?\" Tegan waved and Freddie's eyes flickered over to her and he broke out in an even bigger grin. \"Hello. What a revelation I'm sure the girl who introduced herself as Tegan on the night of the fire drill had an American accent which you don't … but you do\" his eyes flickered back to Poppy \"So what is your name?\" Freddie emphasised 'your' \"Erm, Poppy. Poppy Moore … but hang on, I only spoke to a teach-\" Poppy admitted before realising she must have spoke to Freddie not a Psychics teacher. Freddie merely smirked before revving up and speeding off. \"Er, Bye\" Poppy snapped when he drove off before she could finish. Harriet let out a breath of disbelief and hurt as Tegan turned to Poppy \"You pretended to be me?\" Tegan asked, she wasn't angry just curious as to why. Poppy on the other hand completely ignored her, walking past her to stand in front of Harriet. \"Ooo! Do you love Fredster? Do you want to kiss Fredster on the lips?\" Poppy teased \"Don't be so immature\" Harriet snapped \"Don't try and hide it honey, we got ourselves a SULA\" Poppy ran a finger above her upper lip \"Sweaty Upper Lip Alert\" Poppy finished and with each word, swished her finger in front of Harriet's face, over her upper lip. The glass broken down in uncontrollable laughter and Harriet stormed off, her cronies following behind her. -line break- For what ever reason when Ms Rees-Withers told Poppy she had been sentenced to an audience with Mrs Kingsley she all but forced Tegan along as well. Both girls protested but they still found themselves outside her office. Poppy, brazenly threw the door open and walked in shouting the odds about whose fault it was and was not. \"POPPY! YOU HAVE TO KNOCK BEFORE YOU ENTER!\" Tegan yelled a reprimand \"Go out and close the door\" Mrs Kingsley didn't even look up \"What? But you asked to see me and I've been forced to endure that straggler too!\" Poppy whined \"Hey! I didn't ask to come along!\" Tegan protested from the door way. \"Yes well you have to knock before you enter\" Mrs Kingsley ordered and Poppy flounced out muttering a 'I can't believe, this is all horse face's fault!' . Poppy slammed to door and went and leant against the opposite wall, arms folded across her chest. \"We'll go on\" Tegan urged \"Go on what?\" Poppy said bitterly \"Go on and knock\" \"What a give Mrs-I've-sat-on-a-cactus-plant-and-am-so-very-prude the satisfaction? I don't think so\" \"Jesus Poppy\" Tegan sighed, turning before knocking on the door. \"Who is it?\" The headmistress called from the other side \"Tegan Wills, Miss. Ms Rees-Withers wished me to accompany Poppy Moore on her visit to you, which you called for after the events in our PE class earlier today\" Tegan explained \"Come in\" Mrs Kingsley said and Tegan opened the door, this time the headmistress was looking at them. Poppy pushed herself off the wall and stalked into the office, roughly knocking Tegan into the door frame as she did. \"And you are?\" Mrs Kingsley asked Poppy \"Jesus Christ!\" She cried as Tegan entered the room, closing the door slowly behind her. \"Oh dear and we were led to believe you had a beard and sandals now we'll have to change that stain glass window in the school chapel\" \"Look, I didn't start it. It wasn't my fault and if this were America I would sue!\" Poppy exclaimed, as she approached the desk before in one of the chairs. Mrs Kingsley looked up to see Tegan still stood there awkwardly \"Miss Wills, you may take a seat\" She said and Tegan lightly stepped across the room and went to perch in the chair next to one Poppy was about to sit in. \"That girl is a grade one a-hole with a severe attitudinal problem\" Poppy flopped dramatically into the chair while Tegan just lowered herself gently down, like a lady. \"I know perfectly well what happened Poppy\" Mrs Kingsley told her \"Then why isn't Harriet here too?\" \"Because unsurprisingly it you, two, I want to talk to\" Mrs Kingsley glanced at Tegan. \"Look I know it's very difficult being the only two new girls in your year and looking so alike people assume you're twins\" \"You mean I'm the only normal girl and yeah, people think we come as a pair!\" Poppy protested. \"What do you like to read Poppy?\" Mrs Kingsley leant back in he chair \"Ok Magazine, People, Us Weekly\" \"Tegan?\" \"Miss I seem to find you're either a reading person or a drawing person and I am most definitely the latter. I find reading single minded, you're told what to imagine by the author where as in art everyone interprets every piece differently\" Tegan smiled, Poppy scoffed and Mrs Kingsley praised her with: \"Good answer. Now Poppy do you think you could tackle a book?\" \"I prefer movies\" Poppy tried to negotiate \"Well my personal library seems to missing the book version of Freaky Friday. So perhaps you might try this …\" Mrs Kingsley slid a book off the shelf. It had a blue/green cover and looked to be quite old. \"Oh, my uncles producing the fun version\" Poppy tried to get out it \"Alice and wonderland was originally a book. You might surprise yourself and actually enjoy it\" Mrs Kingsley handed it to her. Poppy snatched it off her before rudely saying: \"This is my punishment? This school is so weird\" \"What do you want to get out of this school Poppy?\" \"To get out of this school\" Poppy shrugged and Mrs Kingsley turned to Tegan. \"Erm, to console my mum and and make her proud by showing her through achieving that I don't hate her guts for sending me here which she's convinced I do\" Tegan fiddled with her fingers. \"You know this school has produced absolutely nobody of note. Our leading light was the girl who was Princess Diana's foot doctor. So if your aim is to make the pages of Us Weekly then this isn't the place for you. What we do produce, that make parents proud, are smart, independent, free thinking, good hearted girls who remain friends for life. The kind of girls that behind your wise cracks …\" she looked at Poppy \"… and your nothing-anyone-says-ever-bother-me attitude …\" she turned to Tegan \"… I know you two are. Run along now, I must get on. My in-tray is piling up\" she dismissed them stroking a ginger cat that had jumped on to her desk. Both girls stood and left, Tegan tucked her chair in and unsurprisingly Poppy did not. As soon as they were out the office, Poppy chucked the copy of Alice in Wonderland at Tegan. \"Here this is right up your I-don't-read-only-draw street. Besides it might spark off some imaginative flair and you might produce a masterpiece\" Poppy smiled falsely and began to walk off \"Yes I might and you might learn some respect and manners\" Tegan replied nonchalantly as fell into line and walked with her \"Excuse me? But what is that supposed to mean?\" Poppy snapped, stopping still in the foyer by a staircase \"It's means I get why you dislike …\" \"Hate\" Poppy corrected \"Hate's a very strong word. You haven't known Harriet long enough to hate her. But all Mrs Kingsley's done is try to help you and you treat her like dirt. You probably looked at her cat more admiringly than you did her\" Tegan sighed \"Cat? Shit! Tree-grown, do I have cat hair on me? The thing was ginger it'll totally clash with the blue\" Poppy ran out of the foyer, frantically dusting herself. \"Un-Bloody-lievable\" Tegan put her hand on the circled decoration of the banister top before resting her forehead on it. \"That girl is a …\" she began until a male voice cut her off: \"Ah, ah, ah, Miss no swearing in school\" \"I'm sorry sir I - oh it's you\" Tegan started before looking up to find Freddie walking down the stairs towards. \"I'm hurt, 'just me'? How rude, Miss … Moore?\" He teased, before guessing at who's company he was in \"Funny you think most people would no the difference between an English and American accent\" \"Oh, so Miss Wills. I must say its a pleasure to actually meet the real you and not your copy playing a facade\" Freddie was now stood on the bottom step and only one above so was very close \"Please don't call her my copy\" Tegan all but begged in a teary and upset voice, dropping her head back down to rest on her hand \"Hey, hey. Don't get upset. I'm sorry\" He pushed some loose strands of hair behind her ears (that she'd taken the cuffs off but left her 3 favourite earring sets in) and then moving his hand down and clasping her shoulder. Tegan lifted her head to look at him and said: \"It's ok I'm just slightly pissed at being called Poppy's double or Poppy's twin or just considered to be part of a bundle with Poppy. God I'd hate to a twin - it'd be so suffocating!\" \"Well talk to me. Show I, Freddie Kingsley that you, Tegan Wills are an individual and completely unique\" he smiled rubbing down her arm before coming back up stroking her shoulder, his fingers skimming her collar bone. \"I should really get back to lessons\" \"What and walk in late, they'd crucify you especially as a new girl\" \"Suppose\" \"Exactly, some come on. Educate me on yourself\" Freddie slid his hand down her arm and took her hand before dragging her off. -line break- \" … oh my god! Really?!\" Freddie asked in disbelief as he laughed so hard tears welled in his eyes. They'd found an unused Computer room to sit in. They'd move two computer's chairs so they were sat opposite each other. \"Ye-ah … really\" Tegan's voice broker with laughter. Her face was purple and tears of laughter rolled down her face. Her chest heaved as she wiggled around in her seat with the forcefulness of her giggles. Once they'd calmed down a bit Freddie suddenly broke the silence that was once consumed with chuckles and said: \"You know Wills, Tegan Wills I've noticed a few physical differences between you and Miss Moore\" \"You known if you say height your really slow on the uptake\" Tegan teased \"No I was going to say you eyebrows are thinner and lighter than hers\" \"That's because mine aren't drawn on\" \"You have 3 sets of ear piercings and I'm pretty sure she only has one\" \"Wow! Steps aside Sherlock Holmes, Freddie Kingsley is the next big thing!\" \"Hush, I've not finished yet\" \"Sorry\" Tegan smiled forlornly \"Its ok. You …\" he began in a low voice before leaning forward and capturing her left cheek in his hand and Tegan blushed profusely \" … have …\" his hand trailed down, cradling her jaw before dragging his fingers along the defined bone \" … a …\" as he reached her chin he laid his hand flat against her neck dragged it down. He rested it on her collar bone, messing up her collar. He then moved his pointer and middle fingers to pinch her left collar and pull it back \" … beauty spot here\" he used his thumb to caress the little circular build up of pigment at the join of her shoulder and neck. \"Beauty spot?\" Tegan whispered feeling a need to continue the quiet atmosphere \"Yeah, didn't your mum ever call those kind of little moles that weren't raised and were a lot more common on skin, beauty spots?\" \"No my mum called them perfect pigment patches\" Tegan laughed lightly and so did Freddie \"In to alliteration is she your mum?\" \"Not particularly\" she shrugged and the two laughed again. Once they'd stopped they realised how close they were and sought off froze. Freddie's thumb was still stroking her neck and they'd just stopped, staring into each other's eyes. \"Where did you say Fredster went?\" The voice of Harriet rang out. The door was shut but it wasn't locked so they weren't out the clear. Her voice broke their trance and they hesitantly pulled away from one and other. \"Er, I should … erm … I should go, er, get changed\" Tegan said standing \"Yeah, I, er, need to go too\" Freddie also stood. Tegan looked down at the desk and saw the copy of Alice in Wonderland. Guilt swept through her. She'd said such nasty things to Poppy, things she didn't mean. \"Poppy!\" She suddenly exclaimed, raising her hands to her mouth in shock \"Oh Freddie, I'm going to have to go. I've got to apologise to Poppy, I was positively vile and completely uncouth!\" She rushed out in one big breath \"Hey, Tike. Calm down. Poppy gives as good as she gets. When she kicked you off your bed or calls you 'Tree-grown' I bet she doesn't think twice\" Freddie reasoned, using a new nick name for her \"She might not but I do. I'll see you when I see you Freddie and I really am sorry for ditching you like this but I've got to say I'm sorry\" Tegan made her way to the door \"Hey, it's ok. Now go, find Poppy and here …\" Freddie picked the copy of Alice and Wonderland that she'd left on the desk, throwing at her. Tegan caught it with a smile. \" … don't forget this\" he finished \"Thank you\" she smiled and slipped out the room and stalking off to her dorm as stealthily as she could to avoid Harriet. After an unexpectedly lengthy chat, which was more like a massive game of 20 questions with many anecdotes and takes thrown in that evoked laughter induced belly ache, tears, difficulty breathe and not to mention the cute yet awkward intimate moment, Tegan really didn't want to encounter the school's chief bitch a.k.a head girl right now. She reached her dorm thankfully with out running in to Harriet. She threw open and the door. She saw long blonde hair and began, not really registering what she was seeing: \"Poppy! I'm so so sorry! I was out of line and rude and … Poppy, your soaking wet! What happened?\" Tegan cried once she reached Poppy and actually saw the situation. Poppy was sat on the windowsill that she used as a bed side table. Poppy had moved some stuff so she wasn't sat on people's belongings and she was wet through, sat their with out her blazer on and pillow clutched to her front as the stared out the window. She barley acknowledged Tegan's presence, only turning to look at her when she walked in \"Poppy? Poppy are you ok?\" Tegan asked, approaching her at the very moment to door flung open and Kate entered. Both Tegan and Poppy looked at the door and Kate entered with a sour face, removing her blazer as she walked towards her bed. \"Hi Kate\" Tegan smiled but all she got in response was a mumbled 'hello'. At this Poppy sighed and Kate glared as she lay her blazer down on her bed. \"For the tenth time you need to make your bed\" Kate pointed at Poppy's bed. Poppy looked at Kate before letting her eyes fall back to window finding that more interesting. \"Jesus what's so bloody hard? Pick up, put done it's not rocket science\" Kate went to Poppy's bed and demonstrated before retreating to her desk. Poppy pulled her self off the windowsill and began to try to straighten the fitted sheet that covered the mattress. Kate and Tegan watched her struggled for a moment before sharing looks and going to help her. They took Poppy's sheet and began to pull in straight before securing it under the mattress. \"Sit down, we'll do it\" Kate smiled a small smile. Poppy flopped down on her bed as Kate fluffed her pillow and Tegan dealt with her sheet. \"Thanks\" Poppy finally spoke up \"Your freezing, you'll need jumper\" Kate told her as both she and Tegan came to stand on either side of Poppy's legs, who was sat on the bed \"Whatever that is I don't think I have one. I don't think I've got anything thicker than persuito\" Poppy rubbed her arms \"You can have one of mine, I'm not that much taller than you and as we've already established in everything but height our bodies are identical\" Tegan said before going to the draws which her and Drippy shared. It was true though, on one of the first mornings at Abbey Mount Tegan woke to find Poppy going through her clothes (underwear and all) and then Poppy told her that size wise they were exactly the same. In hips, waist, chest and everything the only thing that differed was Tegan's legs in her jeans were longer because that's were Tegan held the height that Poppy didn't have - in mile long legs. She returned to Poppy and Kate with a soft chocolate cardigan that was loose and flowed because of its style. Giving it Poppy, who took with a grateful smile and a: \"Thanks, I didn't really come prepared. I figure I'd be here this long\" Poppy admitted as Kate walked towards a nearby cupboard and Tegan sat down next to Poppy on the bed. \"Nothing worse than the only message you get all day being from the phone company\" Kate sighed and the two look-a-likes shared the same confused look. \"But matron took all the phones\" Poppy protested as Kate closed the cupboard before joining the other two blondes on the bed. \"No she took all your two's phones, she took our decoys. She has no idea none of them works. We keep our real phones hidden.\" Kate explained as she messed with her phone a little. \"You peaky blinders!\" Tegan laughed as Kate handed her phone to Poppy. \"Here. Call your parents, call your therapist. Knock yourself out.\" Kate offered \"But why would you do this for me? You guys this I'm a total asshole\" Poppy quizzed \"No you behave like an arsehole\" Kate said \"There's a difference\" Tegan added \"Look I know I'm not some Malibu therapist but I can guess that your feeling scared and a little bit homesick\" Kate guessed and Poppy nodded \"Which from experience doesn't actually make you a bad person just a normal one\" Kate finished after Poppy's confirmation. \"Sweet photo, is that your mum?\" Tegan tried to change to subject and noticing the beautifully framed picture of her carbon copy with an older woman who she assumed to be her mum it seemed like the only new conversational topic. Kate turned around at Tegan's comment picking up the photo. \"She going to come out and visit?\" Kate asked \"She died in a car accident when I was 11\" Poppy's voice became tearful and Kate Tegan shared horrified looks at what they'd accidentally done \"Oh Poppy\" Kate sighed \"Poppy, I'm so sorry\" Tegan added, wrapping around Poppy's shoulders and giving her a light squeeze \"I know you're not both some Malibu therapists but erm …\" Poppy trailed off and Kate returned the photo to its place on the beside table. \"Listen are you serious about getting out of here?\" Kate asked \"Yeah\" Poppy nodded \"Then you're going to have to get yourself expelled\" \"Ok\" \"Anybody distorting themselves in a improper manner will be proposed for expulsion before the honour court\" \"The honour court?\" \"It's like a trial in front of the whole school by your peers, your teachers, the head girl and Mrs Kingsley but I'm telling you it hardly ever happens.\" Kate explained \"So if your really want to get out of here it looks like your not only going to have to rock the boat but drive it up on the rocks, blaze the galley and and dance on the burning deck. Your going to have to take it all the way.\" Tegan jumped in. She may not have known the school rules like Kate but could apply an extravagant metaphor to any circumstance. \"Aye aye captain\" Poppy smiled. \"Make your calls … oh tip for best reception? On top of the cupboard\" Kate instructed and Poppy took the phone and stood before tottering over to a high shelf, starting a video recording before putting it there so the camera could film down on her. She started filming a message for a 'Ruby' while Kate and Tegan watched quietly from the bed \"I think she's reached her tipping point\" Tegan whispered \"I just hope she falls the right way\" Kate agreed. -line break- Later that night Poppy was sat up reading Alice in wonderland, that Tegan had returned to her the light of a flame from a lighter. It was very quite and very dark seen as though no else was awake. Poppy heard a creak of a floorboard but dismissed as Tegan rolling onto one particularly loud spot. Moments later though there was click sound and bright lights. Poppy found herself surrounded by her roommates, all of whom were holding very bright touches. \"AAAAHHHHH!\" Poppy screamed, dropping the lighter but thankfully extinguishing the flame before she did. Everyone of them were in their pyjamas, minus Tegan, who was sat swaddled in her sleeping bag that was tight around her face as she'd pulled the adjusting cord. Kiki, Drippy and Tegan were on her right, Tegan being the furthest away whereas Josie and Kate were on her left and Kate being the furthest away. Noticing her scared face and reaction the other 5 broke into small giggles before composing themselves. \"Watch it Wee Willy Winky, you'll set up all a light\" Kate teased \"Now we've had a word with the girls … \" Kate motioned between herself and Tegan to signify who was meant by 'we' \"… true some of them took a little more persuading then others …\" Kate continued and all the touch's beans fell on Drippy, who smiled sheepishly at Poppy's look. \"… but it's decided, we're going to help you. We're your very own crack unit. Operation Freedom, Kiki please explain\" Kate finished and Kiki began: \"Right …\" and Kiki launched into a whole detailed bunch of plans and intricate explanation.[Chapter 4] \"Wake up, Tee! You need to make those cards before everyone wakes up!\" Kiki shook her shoulders as the blonde yawned. After been up half the night discussing Operation Freedom she was absolutely exhausted. \"Huh? F-five more … minutes\" Tegan yawned rolling away from the pyjama clad and pestering Kiki. \"Nu-uh, up now. Be showered and dressed in 20 minutes I'll wake the others\" Kiki pulled the cord loose and unzipped her sleeping bag before chucking her towel and toiletry bag at her. \"Uh\" Tegan mumbled before slowly siting up before going to the bathroom to do what she was told. After a quick but satisfying shower, Tegan emerged squeaky clean and fresh. She'd washed in her Soap & Glory body wash and scrub then applied her Moroccan rose shampoo and conditioner and she shaved. Moving on she also moisturised using Soap & Glory body butter as well as cleaning her face and teeth and combing out her hair. Once she slipped on her uniform, Tegan pulled her waves up in to a loose pony tale that was stylishly messy before staring on her make up of: concealer, BB cream, mascara and tinted lip balm. True to her word when Tegan returned Kiki had all the girls up and they were nearly ready. \"Wow? Josie what's happened to you?\" Tegan laughed as she set her toiletry bag down and put the towel to the wash. \"Shut up Tee\" she mumbled as she made her bed \"Oh dear, is it that time of month?\" Drippy teased \"No it's just that time in the morning, too early in the morning\" Josie scowled and the other four laughed. Poppy burst in from the bathroom, ready and eager to go. \"Everyone ready?\" She asked and the five English girls exchanged glances before nodding. \"Well come on then!\" She exclaimed and silently ran out the dorm and to the Computer Room the others following her. Once they got there Poppy pulled out a chair and fired up one of the computers. \"Well come on Artist, this is your forte\" Poppy exclaimed and Tegan took the offered chair and logged on. \"So do we all remember the plan?\" Kate asked \"Yep\" Josie yawned \"Yes\" Kiki affirmed \"Yup\" Tegan opened up Photo Shop on the computer \"Yeah\" Poppy squealed \"Drippy?\" Kate asked and all eyes fell on her. She looked a little timid as she said: \"Erm, just explain it once more?\" \"We're are commencing with an entry level basic favourite, just to get warmed up. We're going to give Harriet a business career in prostitution, what Tegan's working on. Give the first years a swimming lesson to remember and expose Mr Nellist and Ms Rees-Withers elicit affair\" Kiki told her \"I'd hardly call it elicit\" Josie commented \"You have to dress these things up and besides -\" Kiki was interrupted by Tegan would been busy typing and tapping as the others spoke: \"Where cane I can I get a picture of Harriet?\" She asked \"Er, school website. The link that says Prefects\" Kate told her and Tegan followed her instructions \"Got it\" she smirked \"Why do you need her photo?\" Poppy asked \"Because I can take the top half of the image, so Harriet's head, hair and shoulders. Superimpose it on a model of one of those women modelling 'Naughty School' outfits and just put on a garish yet still underlying slutty background …\" Tegan began \"Like a nightclub?\" Drippy asked \"Nightclub? Kate was confused \"Yeah you know like they have the tacky blinding lights but even though you can hardly see anything you still associate it with slags\" Drippy shrugged \" exactly and it's got to deter from any editing blips\" Tegan explained as she completed the tasks she was verbalising. \"Ok nearly there. Kiki what's her number?\" Tegan asked \"Oh Erm, 07700 900 766\" Kiki told her. Tegan typed the number in a text box next to the edited picture and under the title: Naughty School Girl. Harriet. Underneath Tegan typed a quick 'Satisfaction Guaranteed' before sending it to print. \"Right done\" Tegan smiled, closing the computer down - not saving the work and wiping her internet and search history. Poppy squealed while Josie collected the many sheets with 8 cards on each. \"Ok, Drippy you take them to the art room and cut them up. Give them back to Poppy in English then she can stick them up at Lunch before French, Josie you go with her. Meanwhile Drippy can plant the CD so then in French while Mr Nellist flips out Kate and Tegan will prepare the stuff you need for swimming pool. Kate, Drippy and Tegan'll go back Chemistry and cover for you and I while you sabotage the pool. Then Kate and Tegan will meet you outside reception, and Poppy your going to have to run, and put the heavy metal tape which Tegan's got? …\" Kiki affirmed \"Check\" the natural blonde held it up \"… and jam it in Matron's car, ok?\" Kiki finished \"Ok\" the others said in unison and they began. -line break- They were sat in English analysing and comparing Poems when Drippy rushed in. The whole class turned to look at her, including Mr Broom - a young teacher who tried to be the student's friend as oppose to a disciplinary figure. \"Drippy?\" He asked \"I'm sorry sir, bit of a calamity. I heard the new batch of Wagon Wheels hadn't been delivered, false alarm thankfully. I don't know what I'd do with out my 11 O'clock Wagon Wheel\" Drippy rushed out before taking a seat next to Tegan. On the other side of Tegan was Kate and in front of them was Josie, Poppy and Kiki. \"Very well, Tegan tell her what we're doing\" Mr Broom dismissed \"Yes sir\" Tegan chirped and attention slowly ebbed away from them. They all went back to their 'analysing', pretending to work as they whispered \"You got them Drippy?\" Came from Josie \"Yep … here\" she placed the stack of cards on her knee, shuffling them before passing them to Poppy, under the desk, who was diagonally opposite. \"Great but how are we going to stick them up\" Josie asked \"Well Josie it seems that as well as an Artist I'm quite a good tea leaf. Nipped in to the stationary cupboard and got this\" Tegan put a packet of Blue Tack on the desk \"Tegan Wills! I'm disappointed in you, stealing!\" Poppy whisper shouted in mock horror \"It's you, your a bad influence!\" Tegan joked a reply in the same tone. After an suicidally boring lesson the bell rang signalling lunch. The girls stood quickly packing away with haste. They slung their backs, which were all black leather handbags that were big enough to carry books, over their shoulders. \"Right so are are you two ok having extra gruel later as we'll be missing lunch?\" Kate enquired once they were out the room. \"Yep\" Poppy nodded \"Yes\" Josie smiled. \"Ok, girls Operation Freedom phase 2 is go\" Kate said and Poppy and Josie took off in the direction of to the front of school and Drippy in the opposite direction towards the teacher's lounge. The remaining three shared a look before slowly wandering to lunch. \"We could save them some and sneak it back?\" Kate suggested once they were sat in the dining room. Their group felt small, so small that not even the inedible sludge they were served could numb their adrenalin rush or shake the weird feeling they had \"No offence but if someone snuck this back for me, I'd be more insulted then anything else\" Kiki reasoned \"What? How dare your bring the potato peel slop for me, tis not worthy! For I is queen, bitch\" Tegan put a deep voice and did some over extravagant hand actions whilst then other two laughed \"Yeah I suppose your right and besides how could we get this back anyway - it's basically blended.\" Kate took a spoonful of a yellow/brown lumpy soup before tilting the spoon and letting it slide off before hitting the plate with a wet, splattering sound. Half way through lunch Drippy rejoined them and then when the bell rang signalling lessons, they walked towards the direction of the two departments they needed to be in, that coincidently happened to be in the same building - French and Science. Odd mix, Tegan though to herself as she and the other three rounded the corner to see Poppy and Josie running. Once Poppy and Josie had seen them they rushed up to them. \"It's done\" Poppy gasped for breath \"Ok, well Tegan are about to initiate phase 2, subsection 2 while your in French\" Kate smiled \"If you the chance try and film Mr Nellist's reaction - I'm gutted I'm going to miss it\" Tegan sighed and the others laughed \"Why do dislike him so much?\" Josie asked \"He was horrid to Drippy in that first lesson I had him! He called her Luddite and I've not liked him ever since\" Tegan hugged Drippy, which she gladly returned \"Awe, thank you. At least some cares!\" Drippy responded as they swayed in their over dramatic hug. Suddenly Mr Nellist swung the classroom door open and started shouting at his class to enter. \"Oh, shit! Tee, we've got to go!\" Kate said as Tegan and Drippy pulled apart and Kate pushed her down the nearest corridor \"Bye guys!\" Tegan whisper yelled as the others entered French, Poppy sparing her a wave. -line break- \"Come on quickly!\" Kate hurried as she and Tegan sat in the Chemistry Prep room, mixing a few litres of harmless yet vibrantly coloured water \"Are you sure this'll do no harm? I mean what if it sends their' little, 11 year old cadavers Pink?\" Tegan asked as stirred the two of the 2 litre bottles at once while Kate did the other two. \"Of course it won't! We're making food colouring on a massive scale that's all\" \"If you say so, have you got the fire extinguishers?\" \"Yep. Have you got the red, plastic ball thingys\" \"If you mean the red plastic balls that you fill a child's ball pool with then yes. I found two massive bags in the back of the PE storeroom labelled as 'swimming floats'\" \"Swimming floats? I think Ms Rees-Withers needs her eyes checking\" \"I think so too\" Tegan mocked Jane and Charlotte and the two blondes fell about laughing. After a while longer with more mixing and colouring added to the solutions they were finally ready. \"Come on\" Kate grunted as they both slung one 2 litre bottle over each arm, carrying six fire extinguishers and a bag of red balls each. They trotted difficulty and not very gracefully to the swimming baths. Honestly Tegan was surprised they weren't caught - they made such a racket. \"right, we're hiding them at the back of the baths right?\" Tegan wheezed slightly, as she side stepped down the narrow path that led in to the swimming pool. \"Yep\" Kate groaned. Once they reached the back they all but fell on the floor, allowing the ground to take the weight. \"I'm dead\" Tegan muttered as she sat on the concrete path, her two bottles, 6 canisters and bag of balls surrounding her. \"Well don't be. We've got to back to cover for Kiki and Poppy in Chemistry\" Kate reminded from her spot on the floor adjacent \"Oh for gods sake!\" Tegan hauled herself to her feet, offered a hand to Kate and then the both speed walked/ jogged to Chemistry. When they arrived the rest of the class were already outside and they heard the people in their French class retelling the story of what happen to their friends. They found Drippy at the front of the que, in hysterical fits of giggles \"Hi Drippy\" Kate and Tegan greeted but only got a joyous gurgle in response \"So how did he take it?\" Kate asked and Drippy began to snort as she laughed even harder \"Christ, Drippy. Who swapped you for a pig?\" Tegan raised an eyebrow and Drippy forced out, between laughter: \"Oh my … g-God! Guys … it was … it was soooo fun-ny … Mr … Mr Nellist … Tom-Tom-tomato face … glasses … snapped!\" Kate and Tegan just exchanged a look before laughing themselves. Once they were seated in Chemistry, Drippy, Tegan and Kate (Josie was in another chemistry class) sat and chatted quietly about Poppy and the situation \"If this stuff doesn't get her expelled, noting will!\" Kate argued \"I'm not sure, Mrs Kingsley seems to like her\" Tegan protested \"Regardless of whether she likes her or not she has to be seen to follow the school rules\" Drippy pointed out \"Suppose\" -line break- After chemistry Kate and Tegan quickly packed up. Shoving their stuff into their bags they hoisted them over their shoulders and with a quick 'I'm sorry we're leaving you Drippy' from Tegan and a 'Josie'll be here soon' from Kate, the two sped off. Sprinting down the haul ways and up stairs they quickly chucked their bags into their dorm before racing back to meet Poppy by the doors of the West Wing. Just as the flung open the heavy doors and ran out, Poppy barrelled round the corner at top whack. If it wasn't for gravel (that delayed their skid) and the fact their was three of them (they could utilise each other's Gravity and 'up-rightness' ) they'd have crashed to the ground in a heap. A few shrill screams did emit from each girl as they steadied themselves, regaining balance. \"Right guys, come on!\" Poppy said before rocketing off again, the other two hot on her tail. \"Tee, you got the tape?\" Poppy asked as they ran \"Yep\" Tegan pulled it out of her top \"It was in your bra? Kate asked, slightly out of breath as they were still running \"Hey you made me ditch my bag, where else was I supposed to put it?\" \"Guys it's here!\" Poppy called as they rounded the corner to the front entrance where Matron's car was parked. Laughing they ran up to it, opened the door and all three of them slid in on the two front seats. Kate on one and Tegan and Poppy sharing the other. \"Quick, give me the tape! Give me the tape!\" Poppy made grabby hands signifying her urgency \"Shush!\" Kate laughed, keeping look out as Tegan passed Poppy the tape. Poppy shoved it in and jammed the eject button before turning the volume all the way up to full \"Pull the button off\" Tegan suggested and Kate did. They three began to laugh a little more until Poppy turned her head and suddenly rushed out a: \"Oh my god there's a car!\" \"Get out\" Tegan gasped and the three girls sprung out the car \"Quick!\" Kate instructed before they laid flat on the ground, shuffling underneath. As the car pulled up, Tegan found herself sandwiched in between Kate and Poppy. They were all still giggling silently which granted wasn't a good idea but they couldn't help themselves. The car pulled up and then sound of feet against the gravel could be heard along with Matron's signature stomps \"Woah, it's all right Cerberus! Only me\" the voice of Freddie Kingsley's sounded as he stopped right in front of matron's car - all Kate, Tegan and Poppy could see were his feet. \"Who's Cerberus?\" Poppy asked in a whisper and both Kate and Tegan turned to her and simultaneously said: \"The dog that guards to gates of hell\" before any of them knew it, in movie style bad luck, Freddie dropped his car keys … and they'd rolled right under the car and were pretty much sat under Tegan's nose. The three shared wary glances before … Pop. Freddie's face appeared, looking under the car his expression changed from neutral to confused as the three girls started making wild hand gestures in an attempt to get him not to say anything. They also heard matron storming down the steps, harrumphing as she did to show her displeasure. \"Tike?\" Freddie mouthed looking at Tegan, who both Poppy and Kate looked at. Tegan merely raised a finger to her lips and he nodded discreetly and smiled, reaching under the car and picking up his keys, his fingers brushing the tip of Tegan's nose. He stood back up and the three heard Matron chastise him \"Hurry up or you'll disturb my girls\" she scowled and Kate, Tegan and Poppy heard the muted sound of excited 'hellos' and 'Freddie'. Matron turned and back to ascend the steps when Freddie's impromptu nose tickle from earlier caught up with Tegan. She sucked in a breath and Kate looked at her. \"Don't you dare\" she warned \"I'm sorry I can't\" Tegan sneezed a very feminine sneeze \"Bless you\" Poppy whispered as they heard Matron's foot steps stop. \"Thanks\" Tegan smiled and they then heard Freddie begin to fake sneeze a few times. \"Sorry, terrible allergies\" he explained and Matron's footsteps continued. Poppy suddenly got a brainwave. \"Poppy no\" Kate sighed as the bottle blonde raised her hand to her mouth, blowing on the back of it to create a fart sound. Once she'd done it Tegan couldn't disguise the little giggle that left her before Kate clamped a hand over her mouth as Poppy silently laughed. Matron's footsteps stopped again. \"Sorry. Better an empty house than an angry tenant, right?\" Freddie asked and the girls could almost see the disgust on Matron's face as her footsteps went back inside and Freddie's followed not long after as he chuckled quietly to himself. -line break- Later that day Tegan found she'd been nominated to take part in some Art competition and was held back after the evening meal. While her Art Teacher, Ms Attwell explained the rules and Mrs Kingsley congratulated her as well so did Freddie. After a while Mrs Kingsley and Ms Attwell had become enthralled in a discussion about Renaissance artists that left Tegan to loiter awkwardly as the school cleaners did their job around her. Thankfully Freddie decided to stand with her so she had some company. \"You could have got me in some serious trouble earlier, Tike\" he teased and Tegan turned to look at him incredulous \"Er, excuse me you tickled my nose and that's what caused me to sneeze so it's actually all your fault\" Tegan demanded \"Maybe the sneeze was but the giggling at the end? That was all you\" \"Well yes, but you have to admit it was hilarious\" \"I … oh, ok. It was pretty funny\" \"Pretty funny I think I nearly blew a gasket with the laughter after you and 'Cerberus', was that what you called her? Went inside\" \"You know laughing at people is very cruel\" \"We weren't laughing at you we were laughing with you and at Matron\" \"You're charming aren't you?\" \"Hey you don't have to live with her!\" \"Well don't get on the wrong side of her just yet, ok?\" \"Why?\" \"It's the social on Saturday\" \"And …\" \"I'm going to be there\" \"And …\" \"She might give you a detention or forbid you to come\" \"New girl over here, cut me some slack. And …\" \"Ergh, girls are supposed to be good at reading the signals\" \"Signals? What are you on about?\" Tegan looked as confused as she sounded \"Don't get into trouble with Matron so you can definitely go to the social. I'll be there and I'd like to spend some time with you … If that's ok, of course\" he quickly added \"Yeah, that's more than ok with me\" \"Good\" \"Go-\" Tegan began but Mrs Kingsley interrupted \"Tegan I think it's time you went back to your dorm, I'm sure Matron's missing you\" \"Ok, night miss, miss, Freddie\" she nodded to each of them in turn before exiting. When she returned to her dorm she found it empty. Everyone and all their bath things and towels had gone. \"Bathroom\" Tegan sighed, quickly stripping off but leaving her bra and panties on before slipping a floral silky dressing gown over the top. It was quite a deep V-neck and it only fell to her lower, upper thigh but with its white laces edges it was still a lot more pretty than it was seductive. She pulled her hair out of her bobble, grabbing a paddle brush she yanked out any clumps letting her hair fall down her back as she quickly grabbed her toiletry bag and towel and made her to the bathroom but not before slipping her slippers on her feet. Tegan literally got on to the corridor with the baths on why Harriet appeared out of no where. A pleasant surprise was that she was on her own, Charlotte and Jane no where to be seen. On the other hand the unpleasant surprise was that she'd obviously just got on the shower, was soaking wet and only wrapped in a towel and quite a small towel at that. One of her hands was holding the towel to her chest while the other gripped her intimates and toiletry bag. \"Oh well if it isn't little miss USA\" Harriet basically scowled \"Erm, actually I'm Tegan\" \"Oh\" Harriet looked taken a back before smirking \"And how are you Tegan?\" \"Er, good. Thanks for asking, you?\" Tegan replied cautiously. She couldn't really read Harriet she was far to multilayered and complex \"Me, well I'm positively splendid. I here you got short listed for the art competition. Well done\" Harriet put a hand on her right shoulder before moving to pinch the lace rim over right bust, stroking it. Tegan tensed up as Harriet said with great sincerity and no mockery: \"This really is lovely. Beautiful pattern and I adore the lace detailing\" she continued to fondle the lace, picking up and pulling it aside - exposing some more of Tegan's ample bosom that lie beneath. Tegan gasped, pulling the lace out of her grasp and walking round Harriet but never turning her back to her. Harriet followed her and turned 180 degrees. \"No need to be shy Tegan were all girls here and besides it was only a compliment\" \"Thanks but I really should get going. I haven't bathed yet, I probably stink.\" Tegan tried to joke \"What? Oh, no! No! You smell divine!\" Harriet said trying to … console her. She started overly fussing and reassuring her she didn't smell \"Hey, hey, hey! Harriet, calm down it was a joke\" \"A joke? Oh, yes a joke\" \"Right well I'll see you later I actually do need to bathe\" \"What?! But can't I just have a few more minutes of your time?\" \"Well I need to shower and everything and then get back before lights out. I'm cutting it fine as it is\" \"Oh, ok\" Harriet sighed and then reached out and embraced Tegan, hugging her tightly and covering her in water droplets. Tegan awkwardly reciprocated the hug, patting her back. \"yeah … bye\" Tegan pulled away and all but ran to the bathrooms that her dorm used. -line break- However about 10 minutes prior to the events on the stairs, Kate, Poppy, Kiki and Drippy had all just began a relaxing soak while Josie waited for them to finish so she could go in after. \"Tee better hurry up I don't want to be the only one bathing while you lot go back to the dorm\" Josie vented \"She'll be here soon\" Kiki started as if it was fact. \"I don't get it. It's like you've got immunity. Is your dad some Mafia guy of something?\" Kate turned to ask Poppy, who was in the bath next to her, completely changing the topic of conversation \"Yep, I'm the goddaughter\" Poppy joked \"Whatever it is she's cutting you a lot of slack. We need to up the anti. In fact we need to focus on her big weakness\" Drippy said from the far bath. For some bizarre reason she had a jockey's hat on as she stoked the bubbles. \"Oh my god! You have to snog Freddie!\" Kate exclaimed, eyes popping open as she lurched forward \"Snog? That sounds disgusting! What is that?\" Poppy laughed \"It's English for make out\" Kiki called from her bath next to Drippy, her face and shower cap all that was showing from underneath the bubbles. \"Mrs Kingsley'll go ballistic\" Kate continued \"And Harriet would have an absolute fit\" Drippy laughed and the others chuckled \"Well that's a definite bonus\" Poppy blew some of the bubbles off her hand \"And he'll be at the social\" Drippy added \"Cool\" Poppy nodded \"Just remember, the point is to get caught\" Kate cemented the fact in Poppy's brain \"Alright. So what's the deal with the social?\" Poppy asked \"It's the school dance on Saturday night.\" Josie who was sat in between the sets of two baths told her \"Traditionally it's fancy dress. This year it's movie magic\" Kiki jumped in \"But the only ones who bother to dress up are teachers, morons and Harriet\" Drippy expanded the point and the others laughed again \"I say we dress up fancy, real fancy\" Poppy suggested \"This mission needs to be planned precisely. Kiki?\" Kate asked \"Ok. Operation Freedom, part 2, step 1: attract Freddie. Step 1, subsection A: look the part\" Kiki explained \"Kiki you're actually making something quite exciting doing like psychics homework. Basically we're going into town and we're going to get some killer outfits\" Josie took over \"I want something that says elegant but at the same time incredibly slutty and available … in fact I'm not that bothered about elegant\" Drippy confessed and the others broke out in laughter. Unexpectedly the door flung open and Tegan all but sprinted in, slamming the door behind her and leaning against her chest heaving - if they didn't know any better they'd have been convinced she just legged it from a Psycho's lair. \"Woah, there! Speedy Gonzalez, where's the fire?\" Josie asked and Tegan looked at her with wide eyes before uttering dead seriously: \"Guys we have a situation\" \"What kind of situation?\" Kate asked, sitting forward in her \"A hulking 5' 11\" mass of blonde curls and LaCrosse sticks kind of situation\" Tegan replied, still gasping for breath a little \"What's Harriet done now?\" Kiki sat up to as well as Poppy and Drippy, who was in the bath closet to the door, moved forward \"I think … I think she likes me\" Tegan breathed out and the others exchanged glances of confusion. \"What?\" Kate asked \"Harriet only ever been seen with Jane or Charlotte the first year she's taken on as help\" Kiki added \"Are you sure?\" Poppy raised her eyebrows \"She hugged me, I'm quite sure\" Tegan sounded like she could cry \"Hugged you!?\" They all gasped \"Yeah and she was only in a towel while she had her bra and undies clutched in one hand!\" Tegan exclaimed \"Oh is baby Tee, ok?\" Drippy asked in a voice that you'd address a baby or animal in as she pulled herself (in her sitting position) right to the end of the bath and held out her bubbly arms. \"No\" Tegan pouted accepting her wet yet well meaning hug, perching on the baths end. \"Awe, shall Mummy give you a tickle will that make you feel better?\" Drippy smirked and the other 4 laughed. Tegan looked alarmed all over again as she began to squirm in Drippy's grasp. \"Drippy … No … No tickling … Drippy … NO … DRIPPY!\" Tegan screamed as her frizzy haired friend pulled her face first in to bath with her - submerging them both. Kate, Poppy, Josie and Kiki laughed hysterically as the two resurfaced. Tegan out a hand over mouth saying: \"I think I've just bit you boob!\" The other 4 laughed even louder at her comment, becoming purple as happy tears filled their eyes. \"S'ok probably the most action I'll ever get, anyway\" Drippy shrugged and then all 6 of them died of giggling. After a while Kate, Poppy, Kiki and Drippy got out and once their baths had been completely drained and quickly rinsed clean Josie and Tegan got in. They bathed quickly and were back in the dorm, dressed with fresh faces, clean teeth and combed out hair in no time.[Chapter 5] Tegan, as usual was the first to wake up. She heaved herself out of her sleeping bag and left the acrylic paint piece she'd been working on the night before to dry on the windowsill having forgot to do so when she fell asleep. She leisurely cleaned her face, brushed her teeth, flossed and mouth washed. Then applying her concealer, BB cream, mascara and rosé matt lip colour at a similar pace. When she returned she saw Kate was up and Poppy was stirring. As she was getting changed - into fresh underwear and socks, a pair of mid/dark denim, high waist, ripped, skinny jeans. A black muscle tank with a skull with a Native American headdress on printed on it in vivid colours. She threw on a oversized purple, red and blue checked shirt - leaving it open so her graphic muscle tank top could be seen - Kate, Poppy and Kiki left to get washed, Drippy got up and Josie woke up but didn't actually get up. Tegan combed her hair through and while taking the two bits of tousled hair and the side of her head and pulling them round and fastening them together with a mint green bobble at the back, she tried to wake Josie. \"Come on Josie! Get up! We're going to make ourselves look fabulous!\" Tegan raised her voice while her arms tired from messing with her hair for too long. \"Josie! Come on-\" Tegan pressed \"I'm up! God woman!\" Josie cried getting out of bed and flouncing out the room to get ready as the other three came back in to change (Drippy having left during her argument with Josie). While they changed Tegan pulled a red backpack with a black zips and straps and a pocket on the front. She packed the back that had a small logo she couldn't decipher in a light leather stitched the bottom corner of the pocket. Tegan shoved in everything she thought she needed so: Phone, make up bag (more for Poppy rather than herself), extra bobbles, hand sanitizer, tissues, drawing pad, specialist pencils tin, notepad and of course her purse. Resting her bag on the windowsill she hurdled Drippy (who'd now returned) 's bed and went to rummage through the cupboard they shared for shoes. \"I'm guys, I'm going to go email Ruby - I'll meet you in reception\" Poppy informed them \"Wow! Who are you are what have you done with Poppy Moore?\" Tegan asked \"What?\" Poppy's eyebrows scrunched \"Poppy you always take the longest to get ready\" Kate said as she did her hair. \"And today your first\" Kiki added at that moment Josie returned looking shattered but as soon as she saw Poppy dressed her eyes widened. \"Christ, have mercy it is a sign! Poppy Moore is ready before all of us! The world is ending! The apocalypse is nigh\" Josie threw herself on to her knees on the floor. The others giggled at her displace while Poppy just rolled her eyes playfully \"You guys really are idiots … but your my idiots\" she smiled before stalking out the room. \"Gotcha!\" Tegan shouted in triumph as she found the boots she was looking for. They were tan leather and lace up, kind of like a fashion version of army boots. Tegan sat on Drippy's bed pulling them on, leaving the laces loose and untied as they were meant to be and just tucking the ends of the laces in the sides. Tegan stood quickly grabbing her bag and slinging it over one shoulder. \"You good to go Drippy?\" She asked and the Frizzy haired blonde pulled on her other shoe and nodded \"Ok, guys we'll see you in reception\" -line break- Sauntering down to reception, Tegan was actually shocked to see how busy it was. Drippy laughed at her reaction before grabbing her hand and pulling her into the queue to sign out. Matron was yelling the importance of signing out but everyone just spoke over her. Soon enough Drippy and Tegan got to the front \"After you mi' Lady\" Drippy teased, bowing so Tegan put her snootiest, overly posh British accent, turning her nose in the air as she said: \"Why thank you. It's good to know some youths these days still respect their elders\" after her comment they both erupted with little giggles as Tegan began to sign out. \"Elders?\" Drippy laughed \"Hey I might be older than you, when's your birthda-\" Tegan began not looking up until she was cut off by an actual snooty voice. Harriet. \"Look girls doesn't our resident yank look fabulous - I mean attention catching t-shirt and probably stacked high heels, I mea-\" Harriet began, her and her lackies standing on the stairs behind the sign out book \"Erm, Harriet? Two things, one I'm Tegan not the 'resident yank' and two, my shoes have got a tiny little booty heel on\" Tegan smiled and Harriet gasped before practically skipping down the steps and grabbing Tegan's wrist. \"Oh, T-t why didn't you say?\" Harriet dragged her away as Drippy followed loosing her place in the queue. \"T-t?\" Drippy mouthed \"I don't know. Help!\" Tegan shook her head as she mouthed back. Harriet dragged her over to a window, Charlotte and Jane having moved to stand by Tegan's sides, circling her. Even though they were smiling friendlily, Tegan couldn't feel a little scared \"Oh, T-t you must come round with us. Me thinks it's an necessity\" Harriet stroked the Tegan's palm of the hand she still held \"We think so too\" Charlotte and Jane agreed \"Good then it's settled you're com-\" Harriet began \"Hey Harriet?\" Freddie suddenly appeared up behind her \"Oh, hey Fredster\" Harriet whipped round \"Can I have a word?\" He smiled sheepishly \"You my darling, dear Freddie can have many\" she said and she and Freddie walked off. Out of habit Charlotte and Jane followed and Tegan used that as her chance. She quickly merged into the sea of people by the sign out book. She could Harriet still though, yelling at her cronies \"I don't need you two to follow me everywhere!\" She all but screeched as Tegan weaved through the masses of girls until she found Drippy, who'd been observing the whole thing from a distance. \"Tee? Are you ok?!\" Drippy asked \"Yeah fine\" Tegan smiled just as Kate arrived. \"Hi\" Drippy and Tegan greeted her \"Hey\" she smiled \"Where's Kiki, Josie and Poppy?\" Tegan asked \"Kiki and Josie have gone to fetch Poppy from the computer room\" came Kate's response. They made idle chit-chat for a five minutes or so until their other 3 roommates appeared. Kate, Drippy and Tegan went to greet them but unfortunately so did Harriet, Charlotte and Jane \"Shit\" Tegan whispered, hanging back in the shadows while still being their as much as she could. To top it off Matron also appeared. 'Oh, great! All we need!' Tegan mentally seethed \"Poppy Moore? What are you wearing? Your going to town not appearing in a window in Amsterdam. Change immediately\" Matron barked \"I don't have anything else\" Poppy smiled innocently \"I thought you might be quite concerned by that attire Matron. So we had a little look see in lost property on our way here, didn't we?\" Harriet spoke up \"We did\" her lackies agreed and Harriet snapped her fingers and her first year 'help' appeared from behind Charlotte holding a yellow jumper and handing it to Harriet. \"It'll suit you … I promise\" Harriet mocked as she unfolded and held up the hideous, garish jumper that ha sparkles and sequins all over it and not to mention a ridiculous Yorkshire terrier motif plastered across the front of it. -line break- \"Now that was abuse! And I have my phone today so I can sue there asses for every damn dime they have\" Poppy ranted about the events that had just past. After she'd refused to take the vile jumper, Harriet looked at Matron who nodded and then Harriet, Charlotte and Jane basically attacked her forming a small tag team as they wrestled her in to it. Poppy now clad in the jumper along with the others were making their way out the main doors, surrounded by droves of others students from different years. The 6 were walking in line, from left to right it going: Kiki, Drippy, Poppy, Tegan, Kate and Josie. They were just starting the walk down the steps, listening to Poppy go on and on when a sudden hand caught Tegan's upper arm causing her to stop and noticing there were now 5 instead of 6, the others stopped too. Whipping round Tegan came to face Freddie Kingsley. He was walking in the opposite direction which meant she was in such a deep state listening to Poppy she didn't see him approaching. His cheeks were red, his eyes slightly wider than normal and his hair messy. \"You owe me\" he sighed looking exhausted \"Big time\" Tegan agreed and Freddie let go and stalked off into the school while the 6 continued down the steps. \"What was that about?\" Josie asked \"You missed it earlier, he saved her from the savage talons of Harriet\" Drippy jumped in \"It was actually quite romantic\" she continued to mused and Tegan scoffed \"Drippy how many love films have you seen where the lead male, when saving his girl runs off with her sworn enemy?\" Tegan quizzed \"Erm …\" \"Exactly\" Tegan nodded curtly and the others laughed. -line break- Soon enough they reached the bus stop but the teasing about Poppy's jumper was far from over. \"It's cute my grandma used to have a dog just like it\" Drippy said over everyone at the bus stops' giggles \"Poppy, I think your jumper's a cat's pyjamas\" Kiki added just as the bus pulled up. \"Come on, girls. Hurry up\" the conductor ordered and they all hopped on. Tegan had just managed to squeeze on as the bus set off, grabbing the bar. \"Wow, that was close eh, Poppy? … Poppy? … POPPY!\" Tegan cried seeing Poppy rummaging through her bag, the bus driving off with out her. Tegan's comment triggered multiple cries of: \"POPPY!\" Poppy ran after the bus, tottering in her heels as she screamed about not being able to find her hand sanitizer. \"POPPY JUMP!\" Drippy cried \"OH MY GOD! NO!\" Poppy squawked \"OH MY GOD YES! COME ON!\" Tegan held her hand, along Kate and the other girls from the dorm. Poppy then went for it, speeding up she leaped onto the bus, grabbing the bar. They all exchanged relieved glances before busting out laughing. \"Ew\" Poppy laughed, looking at her hands holding the bad \"Ew!\" Josie, Kiki, Tegan, Kate and Drippy all mimicked before laughing even more. -line break- On the bus there wasn't enough seats for everyone so Tegan ended up standing, she gripped the over head bar above her as she stood in front of Drippy with Poppy behind her. She didn't mind very much though and Drippy had her bag her knee, so she wouldn't have to carry it. The bus was alive with conversation when this blaring sound of screaming heavy metal cut through the atmosphere. \"Oh my god! Look!\" Poppy exclaimed as Matron drove up behind the bus and everyone dissolved into uncontrollable laughter that gives you belly ache and sore face. Matron went to overtake the bus, frantically trying to eject the tape and she that didn't work trying to turn it down. All the girls pushed to the side where Matron was overtaking - a shocked grimace on her face - while the girls who were already sat that way swivelled in their seats. Poppy grabbed Tegan using her as a bar as she stood as the bus was still moving and Poppy's heels were dangerously high. An identical look of amusement passed over their' faces as the Matron finally overtook the bus, turning to glare at everyone occasionally. In that moment they had never looked more like a reflection of each other. -line break- Upon arriving in town Operation Freedom, part 2 - which no one had still informed Tegan - of was officially underway. They meandered down the high street when a woman two little dogs walked past. Kate, Drippy, Josie and Kiki crouched and began to pet them. \"Ew\" Poppy scrunched up her nose \"Yeah, I agree. Ew. Go\" Tegan agreed and the two walked out the circle of their crouching friends \"What? I thought you'd be right up the little fluffy animals street\" Poppy quizzed \"I am normally but I hate dogs they're horrible. I don't see why people willingly let 'mans best friend' cover them in saliva\" \"Preach it sister\" Poppy agreed and the others finally caught up with them. \"Where are we going?\" Tegan asked \"To our favourite shop\" Josie stated motioning to the Cancer Research UK shop. \"Cancer Research? Girls I'm all about finding a cure but considering I flunked Chemistry I don't know how much help I'm going to be and BTW which means FYI by the way, er, this is supposed to be shopping time\" Poppy halted and everyone fell into a circle around her \"We're not going to be doing the research, this is a charity shop. The money goes to charity\" Kate explained but it went straight over Poppy's head \"Twin sister from another Mister and the woman that he kiss-ter ... Please explain\" Poppy turned to Tegan \"Erm, well when you've finished with something whether it be a book, film, pieces of clothing, b-\" Tegan began \"Boyfriend?\" Poppy jumped across \"Er, no\" \"Oh for a minute there I thought you Brits were really on to something. A place where you can shift last seasons has beens and clingy exes but go on\" \"Brick a' Brack and just generally anything you donate to the charity shop. If it can be reused the charity shop clean it up and sell it on and whatever money they make goes to charity\" Tegan finished and Poppy froze \"I think she's broken\" Drippy whispered \"Oh I just had heart palpitation. You guys are so adorable! … but it's still a real shame they don't do this for old boyfriends\" Poppy snapped back to reality and Kate, Josie, Drippy, Kiki and Tegan began to walk in before Poppy spoke up again: \"But we need to look really hot for the social so let's go hit Oxford Street\" and the others turned round to face her \"I take it you flunked Geography too. Oxford Street's in London, my friend. This is your lot\" Kiki told her and the original 5 entered, Poppy trailing reluctantly behind. Inside Josie, Drippy, Kiki, Kate and Tegan were having loads of fun as they tried various things on and laughed at how ridiculous people looked in different things our at particularly hideous items. Poppy however was nonplussed. She was walking round in speeches disgust at the jumble sale set up the surrounded her. \"Hey Kate? What about this for Ascot?\" Drippy held up the most disgusting and ancient dress and Kate stuck her head out the changing room curtain, some ridiculous hat in her head \"Magnificent … \" she replied before stepping out the changing room in a bright orange boiler suit \"… is too working day?\" She asked and while her English roomies fell about laughing, Poppy sighed. \"Come on girls! This is a serious mission, get a move on! Now Poppy how about something like this 50 pence?\" Kiki held up a awful garment that had design of Banana splat all over it. \"It's looks like someone died in it. I'd rather stay the Yorkshire terrier freak.\" Poppy pulled at the jumper's sleeves \"Your a Buddhist right? Think of it as clothing reincarnation\" Kate rationalised, removing the boiler suit. \"Honey even Buddha wouldn't be caught dead in half the stuff\" Poppy rolled her eyes \"Still I guess anythings possible. You can sew right?\" Poppy turned to Tegan \"Sew? Of course I can sew, who do take me for?\" Tegan smiled \"My identical twin who creates wonders, come on. Let's do this\" Poppy pulled her hair up. Suddenly the ransacking the shop (neatly) and pillaging it of any mildly ok clothes. They then tried a few pieces on just to make sure before picking a favourite item, with the input of the others. They then went back to find clothes that could be ripped up or reused to make something else that would go with their chosen item. As they joked around Poppy unleashed her inner designer and started taking bits away or adding bits to certain clothes. Tegan made a note of it all down so she new what she was sewing and removing when she got back. After sorting out everyone else, including herself, Poppy started searching for her 'glamorous assistant' as she'd called Tegan Poppy suddenly let out a squeal: \"Tegan come hear, I have something perfect for you!\" She held up a top made of sheer midnight lilac chiffon that was like two triangles that partly sewn at the sides and had a the tops of the triangles connected by a chiffon strip and a sheer midnight lilac ra ra skirt, that only had a little bit off thicker fabric covering the crotch and bum areas. They were obviously from the same set. \"Go try it on!\" Poppy cried and despite what she thought about the skimpiness of outfit she obliged. Going into the changing rooms and slipping in on before going back out to face Poppy's judgment. Personally she didn't like the fact that it was see through. It was basically an upside down V-neck where the triangles tips were sewn to the choker band around her neck before fanning out as it went down and meeting the other triangle at her mid-ribs and that's where they became sewn together. You could see all of Tegan's bra either under the fabric or just because there was no fabric to hide it. \"Kate write this down for me\" Poppy ordered and Kate took try notebook and pencil that Tegan had been previously been jotting down everyone else's requirements in. Poppy approached Tegan and carried out would could be done with sewing as she explained. \"Right. Took the skirt but sit it high on the waist and sew it there, it'll make your legs look even longer but obviously cut off the excess wouldn't want a double skirt, would we? Add these …\" Poppy grabbed a diamanté necklace holding up before throwing it at Kiki who put it down the 'buy' pile. \"… around the collar and wear that cute little black bra underneath\" Poppy finished clamping her hands \"Excuse me?\" Tegan raised her eyebrows \"Oh you know the one a mean. The wired balcony one with the lace all over it\" \"Yeah I know what you mean\" \"And you're sure your not twins? I mean knowing what's in each others underwear drawer, a little weird? No?\" Josie asked \"Hey! It's a one sided thing! She went through all my stuff!\" Tegan protested. \"Oh hush now go get changed\" Poppy ordered and Tegan did as she was told. When she came out she still saw all friends playing dress up. Quickly she wen to the counter and paid before rejoining her friends who were all still dressed up. \"… underway\" Tegan caught the last of Kate's sentence as Poppy gaped: \"Malibu moment. Tee, put that massive fur coat and the floppy navy beach hat the bow!\" Poppy instructed as she dug out her phone. Tegan set her back pack and shopping bag down and with Kiki's help she got into the sandy coloured, heavy fur coat that had long sleeves and fell to her knees. Placing the floppy hat on her head and joining Drippy at the end the line, wrapping her arm around her waist, an action Drippy replicated. \"Remember what I taught you guys?\" Poppy held the phone in front of them and they smiled ecstatically as they said in sync: \"Who are we?\" And pouting before breaking down into laughter. After they'd left Cancer Research they made their way to hairdressers. Drippy went in first, then Kiki, Tegan, Poppy, Kate and finally Josie trailed in. \"Oh my god, it's Tom Cruise!\" The man who Tegan assumed to be the stylist said from his spot, reading a magazine, under the dryer. \"Would you like to say that any louder? I need your help!\" Drippy felt her eyebrows and the man stood. \"And I want a back wax and a night with Michael Bublé but we don't always get what we want. Trudy attend to the brows!\" He ordered as Drippy, Kate, Tegan and Poppy filled up the salon chairs and Kiki and Josie went to the dryer chairs. \"Hum, Yorkie fan?\" He asked Poppy \"Nice dog, Yorkies. I used to have one once, wee Philipe, he got savaged to death by a badger\" and he plucked a hair from Poppy's head, forcing a scream of protest from her. He sniffed Poppy's strand of hair that he'd plucked before continuing: \"Arn you the soufflé that did ne rise?\" \"Tell me about it! Ok. I need these extensions taking out, a seriously deep conditioning. I'm thinking side bangs with some buttery highlights and maybe a few honey tones\" Poppy reeled off while the the man just stood admiring his moustache in the mirror \"Well I'd like a night on Fireman island but I'm afraid I'm whistling Dixy, ok? So here's what's on offer for you: a tight perm?\" He counted to which Poppy's obvious response was … \"No\" \"How about this, a wee bob? That's fun isn't it?\" \"No\" \"What about this? Ooo, Pineapple? Oh oh, Hawaii\" \"No\" \"What about something, a little bit more … natural?\" \"Natural?\" \"Aye, the real you\" \"Natural it is\" Poppy agreed \"Radical\" Kate commented \"Ok ladies, let's do this!\" The man said or as Tegan had learnt from Josie, he was called Mr Christopher began, throwing a gown over Poppy he got to work. As Mr Christopher worked his magic on Poppy, Kiki and Josie say and flicked through magazines. Kate curled and uncurled a strand of her hair around a curler. Tegan pulled out her sketchbook and begun drawing a cantering horse over the moors in greyscale. All the while Drippy was having her eyebrows resurrected by Trudy. All lots of bleaching, toning, hair drying, straightening, combing, brushing, chopping and 'two strong teas bella pronto' later Mr Christopher was ready to unveil his master piece. \"Your ready?\" He asked looking round, Kate nodded and her removed the gown and a collective gasp came from everyone as they last from their seats, moving to surround Poppy. \"Wow! Thank you\" \"Oh, it's nothing darling. I'm cream crackered I'm going to lay down and have a wee satsuma\" Mr Christopher left and Poppy's moved to her sides. Drippy and Kiki on her right, Kate and Josie on her left and Tegan behind her. \"You look so-\" Drippy began \"English\" Kate finished \"And nothing like Tegan\" Kiki and Josie said at the same time. \"I look like my mom\" Poppy sounded emotional \"Is she beautiful too?\" Drippy asked without thinking and they all turned to her with sad smiles. \"She was, very\" Poppy affirmed \"Sorry, foot and mouth disease\" Drippy laid her head on Poppy's arm. They left Chrissie's cuts not long after, having collected their bags, Poppy paid and Tegan had an argument with Mr Christopher telling him that 'she wasn't Poppy's twin and a natural blonde so he couldn't try to recreate his masterpiece or it'd end terribly'. They stumbled out the door nattering away, light heartedly. \"Ok. Time for the juice, any bright ideas?\" Poppy asked \"Leave it to me I've got a plan\" drippy and her, Kate and Poppy went inside a wine store while the other 3 waited outside \"What do you think they're going to do?\" Josie asked \"Try and get some alcohol\" Kiki rolled her eyes \"Well, duh! But how?\" Josie pushed \"No idea\" Kiki shrugged \"Me neither but I think Drippy looks a little to young to be purchasing alcohol. Poppy can get away with it, Kate most likely but Drippy?\" Tegan deduced \"Nah\" Kiki and Josie shook their heads. Less than minute later the doors flung open and a angry Kate and guilty Drippy came out. \"Why did you order the cream eggs you idiot?\" Kate sighed, closing the shop door \"Why did you only get 2 Drippy? Now we've got to quarter them and even then someone's going with out\" Josie accused \"He believed us till then!\" Kate added \"Oh, yeah right! Maybe if you hadn't asked me what Keith's report was about … where's Poppy?\" Drippy fumed and just in time the Poppy opened the door and stepped out. \"Are you ok?\" She asked Drippy as the door slammed \"I'm furious, stupid Drippy\" Kate spat \"I know … never mind lets go!\" Poppy help up a white plastic carrier bags with 2 bottles of wine in. They all quickly rushed back to the town's bus stop. -line break- As soon as they reached the school Kate sighed them all in while the the others legged into the dorm. In matter of minutes it had from a bedroom to beauty parlour. Tegan pulled a mini sewing machine, setting it up while Josie and Kiki assembled to outfits. Drippy and Poppy began planing everyone's makeup and accessories. Kate came up and the the tempo was really turned up. Tegan would sew an outfit and while that outfit was been sewn it's wearer had her makeup, hair and nails done and her accessories and shoes (both of which Poppy loaned them unless, like Drippy you'd bought shoes) assigned and helped into. They quickly got into a cycle and dresses were being produced like wildfire. Even when Tegan was sewing her own dress, Drippy and Poppy applied her make up, did her hair and painted her nails (which was very difficult) while she was doing it. Soon enough they were ready. \"Operation Freedom, part 2 are we ready?\" Kate asked \"YEAH!\" They hollered and tottered and teetered out the room, down the stairs and towards the hall where the social was held. Drippy looked divine in hot pink sarong style dress. Josie really worked her orange dress with sparkly fabric scrunched over the skirt. Poppy in her red and cream dress with newly brunette hair looked every inch the stunner. Tegan in her daring nearly transparent dress that was more like a piece of fabric (with Poppy's suggested bra choice), she actually pulled of phenomenally and like Poppy said made her legs look like they on forever. Kiki in her dark purple dress with glittery embellishments and shoulder pad looked nailed the surreal chic look. Kate with her red dress that highlighted her assets truly looked the lady. They descended the main staircase all with immaculate hair, pristine make up and perfectly co-ordinated accessories and shoes. Confident looks graced their faces and the looked like driven women on a mission. \"Lips, tits, hips and butt\" Poppy gave them their final repetition of how to walk 'seductively'. Once they'd entered the hall the group split up going up private conquests, Tegan went to follow suit but Poppy grabbed her hand. \"Not you, come on\" and with that Poppy strutted ahead leaving Tegan to catch up in a sashay. Josie and Kiki hit the dance floor (which was more of an elevated turn table) and Jane and Charlotte removed their Pride and Prejudice wigs before going to join them. Poppy and Tegan, slinked through the crowd their hips rolling and boys watching their' every move as the approached Freddie who was stood with Harriet, no surprise. Freddie looked slightly awe struck by the two girls and Harriet looked disgusted \"Hi\" Poppy flirted \"Hey\" Tegan waved \"Hello Trouble, like your hair though you don't look that much like Tike anymore\" Freddie's eyes started on Poppy before to Tegan at the end of the sentence. \"Hello, Wills. Tegan Wills\" He smiled in a cheeky manner \"What are you two doing? This is a themed costume party not a dwarf prostitutes convention\" Harriet chastised and Freddie tried very hard not to laugh as the once identical but not different girls stared at the exact same look of disbelief and exasperation painted across their' faces. 'They're not that different' Freddie chuckled inwardly as Poppy began to retort: \"I'm so sorry! I'm must say though you look incredible! You make an excellent Shrek\" At this Freddie did laugh but Harriet was not amused, you could almost see the steam erupting out of her ears \"Poppy!\" Tegan hit her arm, lightly. Chastising her with a laugh as the song changed. \"Oh, this my favourite song come on!\" Poppy grabbed Freddie's and tried to drag him off but he stood his ground, pulling Poppy back to him \"Actually Trouble I was going to ask Tike if she wanted to dance\" he smiled sheepishly, looking at Tegan who blushed looking down as Harriet's and Poppy's eyes fell on her. \"Sure, you two have fun … well not to much fun, Tee's to young … and I'm just gonna stop talking\" Poppy babbled, grinning like a Cheshire Cat after it took her a minute or two to recover. After her comment she slipped back into the crowd to find Drippy and the others \"Tike?\" Freddie asked as he led he to the dance floor. Once there, one of Freddie's arms wrapped around her waist and his other hand held hers. Tegan's free hand rested on his bicep. They slow danced simply staring into each other's eyes, faint smiles across both their' faces. Occasionally her spun her slowly but their eyes always re-established contact straight away afterwards. \"So Tike, how are you liking your first social?\" Freddie asked \"Well the company's definitely making it more bearable\" \"I aim to please\" \"do you this to every new girl or … ?\" \"Just the pretty ones\" \"Oh, well then - where's Poppy?\" Tegan mockingly asked, pretending to look for her and Freddie chuckled a adamant protest: \"Who I call Tike with naturally blonde hair and a beauty spot on the left side of her neck.\" \"Picky much?\" Freddie broke away from their gold and spun Tegan \"Well I know what I want and how I want it\" He shrugged as she came back into his chest and he reaffirmed his grasp on her \"You want me?\" \"Not it that way, Tike … Not yet anyway\" \"Freddie Kingsley! What would your mother do if she heard you say that?!\" \"I'd be severely punished\" \"Even more punished than what you were when you were 11?\" \"Ergh, how do you know about that?\" Freddie groaned in embarrassment as he dropped his head to Tegan's shoulder \"Drippy, her exact words?\" Tegan asked and Freddie nodded his head against her shoulder before pecking her scantily clad collar bone and part of her narrow black bra strap. \" 'The massive hoo-hah when he was caught playing doctors and nurses with a third grader' \" \"Jesus, you make one bloody mistake …\" \"And everybody remembers but you do something good everyone forgets? Right?\" Tegan finished for him and Freddie lifted his head from her shoulder \"Yeah, how di-\" Freddie began but the sound of Harriet squealing as she hijacked Mr Nellist's DJ station. Still in hold, Freddie and Tegan turned to face Harriet who glared at them before -line break- Poppy disappeared into the crowd she needed to find the others and quick. Soon enough she found all four of them by the drinks table by the punch dish. \"Guys, guys Operation Freedom, Part 2, Subsection A! Abort! Abort! Abort!\" Poppy cried \"What why?\" Kate asked \"He has a thing for Tee!\" Poppy explained \"Tee?!\" Drippy, Kate, Kiki and Josie said at once. Kate recovered first with: \"We'll watch does the little bitch think she's doing! She knows this is your only chance to get out, she needs to retract her claws!\" \"Well it seems that it's more him liking her at the minute\" Poppy snapped in defence and Josie backed her up \"Yeah and when you think about Tegan was never their either time we talked about Operation Freedom, part 2, attract Freddie\" Josie pointed out \"She's right!\" Kiki added \"Well what are we going to do now?\" Drippy asked \"The only way to get to Mrs Kingsley enough to kick you out now then is to ... is to bad mouth the school!\" Kate said \"Oh shit\" Drippy said \"What?\" Poppy asked \"Harriet\" the Frizzy blonde gulped \"She looks like she is going to commit mass murder\" Kiki commented \"And I bet Tegan's going to be the victim\" Josie added \"Well don't just stand there! We gotta go save baby Tee!\" Poppy cried. As the youngest in her dorm, being born on July 6th, Tegan had become known as 'Baby Tee' by her roomies. Poppy led the rescue brigade through the crowd just as Harriet stormed Mr Nellist's DJ booth. They came to stand in between two of pillars just as Harriet pressed a button and a rap track came on. Poppy heard the song and suddenly squealed, jumping up and down. \"Oh my god this is my jam!\" She cried before walking onto the dance floor and up to Freddie and Tegan. \"Excuse me Lover boy but I need to borrow baby Tee\" she smiled \"Be my guest\" Freddie smiled and going to lean against one of the pillars. \"Poppy?\" Tegan looked at her questioned not nervous about whatever Poppy had planned, she'd just take it in her stride - Tegan found situations were only as awkward as a person made them - but if was dancing she'd have liked to have known the routine \"Just follow my lead\" Poppy instructed and began and did Tegan as she copied, learning the dance as she did it. Both Poppy and Tegan moved with confidence and no trace of humiliation, despite neither really knowing what they were doing. They whipped their hair, clapped, shook their assets facing both the left and right as well as straight on. The two's' dancing attracted a lot of attention from the boys from Freddie's school who'd attended as well as the Abbey Mount girls who were a little shocked. Poppy and Tegan then rotated their hips prominently exercising great isolation before dropping into a speedy crouch, bouncing twice there and then standing up. Taking a side each they then prowled round in a circle their' backs to each other as they clapped and observed the people watching. They circled their hips and got lower to ground too every now and then before continuing. Everyone was clapping but immediately Tegan could see Kate and Drippy in between one set of pillars, Josie and Kiki between another, Freddie by himself. \"Go girlfriends! That's is entirely wicked\" She heard Ms Rees-Withers shout and glanced at Poppy who smirked just as their paths met and they stopped. Still following Poppy's lead, they dropped in to a crouch once more bouncing on their knees as the moved their hands over their knees a few times before standing. Poppy held her hand forward, signalling Tegan to go first through the gap in between Kiki and Josie. Tegan stepped through no problems, high-fiving Kiki and Josie on the way. Poppy followed her - problems. Some how Poppy managed to go over on her shoe, falling straight in to Tegan from behind and pushing her down the small flight of steps that led on to the dance floor. Josie managed to grab Poppy just before she fell on top of Tegan. Unfortunately Kiki didn't have enough time to save Tegan though. The blonde hit the deck with a thump and the room quieted down. Despite music still playing and screams from Tegan's roommates and gasps from everyone else, the lack of clapping really dulled the mood. Tegan just lay there giggling and gurgling like an excited baby. \"Hey are you ok?\" Freddie was the first to appear, brushing a her straightened fringe (Poppy and Drippy had ironed her her hair flat for the occasion) from her face. \"OH MY GOD! TEE I'M SO SORRY! I'M SO CLUMSY!\" Poppy was next, worrying and fussing as she scanned Tegan's body for cuts or bruises. \"Is she ok? Shall I call an ambulance? You can be sick in my hands if you'd like?\" Ms Rees-Withers came in Tegan's eye line and Tegan just giggled \"She's acting like she drunk …\" Harriet began \"Oh I wish I was then maybe my alcohol addled brain would turn you into something nice, like, a … oh, I don't know - a sheep\" Tegan said delirious as Kate, Josie, Drippy and Kiki came to loom over her \"Do you know a bitchy sheep, Drippy?\" Tegan asked her newly present friend, who looked confused \"Er, no\" she responded \"Well in that case I wish you to be a sheep, Harriet. It wouldn't just be an improvement personality wise either …\" Tegan trailed off into a puddle of laughter \"She should be taken to bed\" Harriet declared \"Freddie can do the honours\" Poppy suggested and everyone looked at her but it typical Poppy style she just smirked and raised her eyebrows \"You two really both are horridious pieces of work!\" Harriet snapped \"Mr Darcey don't think so\" Tegan teased in giggles from her spot on the floor. Harriet 'harrumphed' before storming off, no doubt to find her lackies. \"She's just a little concussed. She just needs some air\" Freddie smiled \"Great idea\" Kate interjected as Freddie took her hands and gently lifted her into a sitting position with a: \"Come on\" At the sudden gravity shift Tegan began to become light headed and her upper body started to sway a little. \"Woah!\" Josie cried coming behind and holding her shoulders \"Watch it Tee, you'll do yourself some real damage\" Kiki added \"Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! Tegan I am so so so so so sorry! I didn't mean to! I have terrible balance! I'm the klutz of my family! I-\" Poppy's apology went on and on \"Poppy! Ssh, I'm ok, but please … ssh. My head hearts\" Tegan's voice became a whined whisper and she raised her hand to her head \"You think you can walk?\" Freddie asked in a low voice, his mouth right next to her ear. \"I think\" was Tegan's sole reply as she began to stand. Freddie had arm wrapped around her waist. Josie had her underarms and Kate grabbed he hands. Between them they lifted the surprisingly light, tallest member of the girls dorm, to her feet. Once up, Tegan's head fell to Freddie's shoulder as if it weighed a tone \"You alright?\" He whispered \"Dizzy\" Tegan mumbled against his skin \"Come on\" he said, arm still wrapped around her waist as they walked towards the reception foyer. \"I'm going to pull away now, not because I want to, but because we're in the main school and your mum would kill us both if anyone saw. I'm a bit steadier on my feet now anyway\" she smiled still obviously suffering from the concussion as her brain didn't filter what her voice said, other wise she wouldn't have so openly confessed she liked him being close \"Good idea\" he smiled. They continued walking in a comfortable silence minus the click of Tegan's heels for a while until Freddie spoke up: \"So explain yourself Miss Wills\" \"I'm afraid I can't explain myself sir because I am not might self right now, you see\" Tegan said without really even knowing where it came from. She vaguely remembered reading it in the Alice and Wonderland book, Mrs Kingsley gave Poppy that she had a quick skim read of before Poppy asked for it. Aside from that though she had no idea why she said it. They reached a love seat and took occupation of it, Freddie walking round to sit on the far side while she took the nearest seat. \"Said Alice to the caterpillar\" Freddie laughed \"Your right, how did you know?\" \"I was Alice in the school play - all boys before you look at me weirdly\" he laughed and so did she. Despite sitting in opposite directions they'd titled their bodies to face each other and when they laughed at Freddie's comment, subconsciously they leant forward as they laughed. Tegan and Freddie found themselves less than an inch apart when the laughter died down. After a moment of just looking into each other's eyes, Tegan, feeling a little over zealous, leaned in a little going to close the gap but Freddie's hands caught her shoulders and held her still. The action was enough to reinstate some sensible thought and Tegan quickly pulled back and she gasped as her hands covered her mouth. \"I am so sorry! I don't know what came over me I-\" she began. \"Don't apologise it's ok\" he smiled, now having straightened up as well \"It's just I don't think that's appropriate\" he added and at the Tegan raised an eyebrow, her hands dropping from her face. \"Appropriate? Ok, leading lady. All boys school. Awkward with intimacy. Cards on the table, are you gay?\" She quizzed \"Er, Just English, you're sure you've not some how magically switched brains with Poppy after that little routine earlier? Like some strange fusion, cross over thing?\" He laughed \"Positive, but why then?\" \"Because I am sober and sensible and you my sweet friend are over excited and concussed\" Freddie reasoned, evoking a hum of mingled laughter and agreement from Tegan \"I go back to school tomorrow but I'll be back on the 18th, how about I see you then?\" He bargained \"Ok\" \"I'll make a deal: no more head frying behaviour, I sense it might be your forte\" Freddie presented his terms \"How very dare you, I am not Poppy Moore! But ok, I won't fry your head … if you don't poach my heart\" Tegan jested before seriously negotiating. She only just became aware of how close they'd become and this time it was Freddie that leaned in first. She decided to follow his lead \"Deal\" he murmured just inches away from her lips, his hand now caressing her cheek while her's lay on his shoulder. They were just about to close the gap, when someone cleared their throat. Tegan and Freddie pulled back again slightly and turned to face who ever had interrupted them. \"Oh crap. Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee\" Freddie sighed. Jane and Charlotte stood in the archway of the corridor \"Yeah but the real question is: which one's which?\" Tegan raised her eyebrows \"Fraternising with the girls, Freddie Kingsley - as you are well aware, is not allowed\" Charlotte reprimanded him \"Tegan Wills, get back inside. Immediately\" Jane added. Tegan merely rolled her eyes. \"See you on the 18th\" she smiled before standing and slowly leaving but not before making a snide remark to Jane but it was directed at the pair of: \"Yes Mother, sorry I breached my curfew\" -line break- Upon returning to her little group, Tegan saw Kate snogging a boy, Josie and Kiki giggling while Poppy still freaked out but Drippy was no where to be seen. \"Nice work Kate\" Tegan praised and upon her return Poppy shot from her chair and launched herself at Tegan. \"TEGAN! YOU'RE OK? YOU'RE NOT DEAD? OH MY GOD IM SORRY!\" Poppy yelled as she clung to her once carbon copy \"Pops, I'm fine\" the blonde consoled as they both sat down on the chairs next to the others \"So what's going on with you and Freddie?\" Kate spoke again \"God knows! He gave me a lecture on how I was miss reading signals a few days ago. Then tonight he refused my kiss and then later tried to kiss me! Boys are so confusing! Then Harriet's goons magically appeared - God knows whether they'll tell her\" \"They should do, they are her 'spies' after all\" Kiki reasoned \"Yeah but they seemed absolutely petrified of delivering the news\" \"Yeah but still they should tell her. Their basically her skivvies right?\" Kate added \"Clearly not\" Josie motioned over to where Charlotte and Jane appeared to be lying to Harriet about had happened \"Right we're going to have to up with an addendum to plan B\" Kiki pressed \"Yeah, we need to find away to trash the school's reputation enough to get Poppy out\" Josie added \"Trash the school's reputation? What?\" Tegan asked \"Isn't it ironic how my ticket out of here just might be the I want to stay? … I mean one of the reasons, anyway\" Poppy asked before Tegan could get an answer \"Someone call Algore I think the Ice Queen is melting\" Kate joked at Drippy quickly skipped up to them, shoes in hand and placed herself down on Kate's knee \"What an excellent night, 8 boys have actually come up and directly spoken to me!\" Drippy gushed while she and Kate hugged and the others laughed \"Now for all you lovers out there … it's the final chance. It's the last dance\" Mr Nellist's slightly slurred voice came through the speakers. Poppy, Tegan, Drippy, Kate, Kiki and Josie all exchanged the same look before hopping to their feet, crying 'come ons', 'woo's' and 'last dance, everybody's' as they all ran to the dance floor. They clattered on to the little wooden dance floor, grabbing hands and linking arms as stupidly slow danced together in pairs - Drippy and Poppy, Kate and Tegan and Josie and Kiki. \"There is something I have to tell you!\" Poppy cried \"Oh, we already know, you wax your bum!\" Drippy smiled as the others gathered round. Poppy laughed before saying: \"Not quite, but similar ball park\" \"You haven't done it, have you?!\" Drippy deduced \"No. I mean I couldn't admit back home so I kind of lied but … I'm a total Nun!\" \"Welcome to the Nunnery!\" Drippy grabbed her and they all huddled together in circle, tightly grasping one and other and belted out the final line of Angels by Robbie Williams: \"I'M LOVIN ANGELS IN STEAD!\" Before crumbling in to laughter.[Chapter 6] The next morning was not so fun. The girls had a LaCrosse game first and the effects of the Social were still reeling with in them. They changed in their' sports kits with great reluctance and little effort but Josie and Kiki seemed to be the most unaffected as they jogged out the changing rooms ready for LaCrosse when everyone else did. \"Come on girls! If we loose today we're out of the championships, again!\" Josie prep talked, quite loudly as she left. Poppy, Kate, Drippy and Tegan had been asked to stay behind by Mrs Kingsley so were sat on a changing room bench waiting for her. Drippy, Kate and Poppy were incredibly hung over and worse for wear - groaning at every noise made. Tegan felt fine, having not touched the alcohol but did have a bit of a bump on the back of her head. Although Tegan wasn't actually sure why she was there, she assumed it was because Poppy was and despite now looking different they came as a pair. Mrs Kingsley then sauntered into the changing room and over to the four. As soon as she arrived the four got to their feet, Tegan quickly and steadily while other 3 swayed upwards making noises of protest while Tegan reached across to steady them by grabbing their elbows or shoulders \"Perhaps you'd like to explain last night to me, Kate?\" Mrs Kingsley sounded royally pissed off. \"… I'm sorry we just got a little bit carried away\" she hesitated \"Well as I understand it, Drippy got totally carried away by Mr Nellist and Ms Rees-Withers after she lay in a pool of her own vomit\" Mrs Kingsley continued \"Actually, it was Kate's vomit, Mrs Kingsley - I wash just lying in it\" Drippy defended and Kate turned to give her a 'really?' look as Mrs Kingsley began to chastise them: \"I expect better of you two! You know the values we stand for at Abbey Mount and as for you Poppy I don't know whether to be pleased that you've finally made some friends here or here or furious that you've led them astray!\" \"Actually Miss, this is all kind of my fault\" Tegan raised her hand and while her three friends looked at her in disbelief, Mrs Kingsley just scrunched her eyebrows as if trying to decipher whether to believe what ever Tegan was about to say. \"I was the only sober one out of the four of us after Josie and Kiki went to bed. I was responsible for them and instead of keeping an eye on them, as I knew they were already a little tipsy, I just turned the other cheek and ignored it. If I had intervened they wouldn't have ended up in the state they did - I should have been watching them more carefully\" Tegan explained \"Tegan that's very humble of you but I gather for a majority of the evening you weren't actually at the party but rather, outside it after Poppy here knocked you to the ground - giving you mild concussion I believe\" Mrs Kingsley challenged \"True but … hey, no teachers were there at that point. How do you know?\" \"Freddie\" was Mrs Kingsley sole response as Tegan blushed. \"Dismissed … not you two, Miss the Moore, Miss Wills\" she sighed after a minute and when the four began to trail out the headmistress quickly called back her once doppelgänger two stopped and turned to face Mrs Kingsley. \"I gave your parents my word that I'd try and help you both but I'll be honest you're both making it awfully difficult. You are both cleverer and better this, why you give yourselves a chance? Try? Try at something. So them that you can rise to the occasion because judging by the outfits you teamed up to create last night - when you put your mind to something you can do it. Don't give up on yourselves because I haven't and neither have your parents. Now off you both go\" She encouraged and the two girls gave her small smiled before leaving the changing room and going to join their class. They came out the doors to Drippy saying: \"I really do feel sick\" and Kate's curious nature: \"What did she want?\" She asked. The brunette and blonde versions of the same person looked at each other. \"Oh nothing, just a good spa destination\" Poppy shrugged them off before continuing towards the others that were warming up. Tegan following closely behind and Drippy and Kate behind her. Once they reached the class Kate and Drippy took up their positions on the grass while Tegan and Poppy sat down on the bench with Ms Rees-Withers and Harriet's first year help. Abbey Mounts side were loosing badly, in the first few minutes the away team out themselves one up. Ms Rees-Withers sighed as Poppy got to her feet. \"Come on guys!\" She shouted in encouragingly. After a while longer of play in which Abbey Mount hadn't equalised or scored, Drippy ran down the side, position bib off as she clutched her stomach. \"Oh god, I feel really vile. I think I'm going to puke. Seriously Poppy your going to have to take my place\" Drippy nearly heaved as she approached the bench. Poppy and Tegan were stood, leaning on LaCrosse sticks while Ms Rees-Withers and Harriet's youngest lackie remained seated \"There's only 7 minutes left!\" Poppy reasoned but Drippy threw up. The other four gasped. Drippy levelled back up, wiping her mouth on the bib which she then extended out to Poppy \"Tee?\" Poppy glanced at her not taking the bib as Tee rolled her eyes and went to grab but Ms Rees-Withers all but slapped her hand away. \"No! No LaCrosse for you Miss Wills your cranium still might be a little sensitive from that fall last night\" the sports women protested and all eyes fell on Poppy was about to protest adamantly just as Harriet jogged over \"Don't worry Ms Rees-Withers. We'll play one man down, we don't want to carry dead weight. No offence\" Harriet scowled at Poppy \"Oh none taken, but seen as though you don't want me to playing on your team … well I'm frigging playing!\" Poppy pulled the bib over head, picked up her LaCrosse stick and ran on to the pitch leaving a very riled Harriet behind as Ms Rees-Withers and Tegan tried to comfort Drippy who threw up again. \"Josie on the wing! Poppy go long!\" Kate shouted commands from her position in the net. Tegan saw Poppy looking ridiculously out of her depth as she muttered to herself as she ran around like a headless chicken trying to avoid physical contact with everyone as she swung her stick wildly in the direction of the ball. She finally got it and Tegan heard her holler: \"JOSIE! HELP!\" \"POPPY! OVER HERE! PICK IT UP!\" Came the response and Poppy did as she was told throwing the ball to Josie. She then yelled encouragement at Josie as she weaves through the opposition, keeping possession of the ball before scoring and screams pierced the air. All the team raised their sticks above their head and cheered while Ms Rees-Withers enveloped both Tegan and Drippy in a tight hug at the same time before Drippy made a retching sound causing Ms Rees-Withers to quickly let go before she spewed again. Harriet walked up to the celebration looking highly annoyed especially when Poppy smirked at her. -line break- Unfortunately for Harriet though her annoyance was about the be amplified. The entire student body sat in the assembly hall the Friday afternoon, listening to Mrs Kingsley present the weekly event. Tegan, Poppy, Kiki, Drippy, Kate and Josie were all sat on one pew as their headmistress finished up they assembly with: \"… And finally, in news as shocking as the fall of the Berlin Wall our under 18 LaCrosse team has gone through to the second round of the county championships for the first time since 1976\" and the students and teachers broke into applause and a raucous swept through the hall. \"To sign up for extra practice please see Harriet Ben- oh, my apologies. No. It seems you should see Poppy Moore\" Mrs Kingsley smiled and the all the girls broke in to little whispers and speculations as to why Harriet was no longer head of the LaCrosse circuit. -line break- A few days later Poppy arranged her first extra LaCrosse session. Poppy was ordering everyone around while being flanked by Josie. Everyone who's attended the session had just finished a brutal stretch session that only the accomplished yoga teachers could complete. Soon enough they all dropped to recover on the floor while Poppy and Josie stood looking unimpressed \"Alright, people choose a goal buddy! From now on each sentence starts with 'I will' not 'I want to'\" Poppy ordered. \"I will want to salvia vomit if we have to call each other buddy\" Drippy stated from her position sat on the floor next to Tegan \"Here here\" Tegan agreed \"Shut up\" came Poppy's simple response and Tegan blew a raspberry at her causing smiles to brake on everyone's faces - even Poppy. \"Hit it. I'm giving us an aggression make over\" Poppy ordered and Josie hit play on the CD Player she had on her lap and music began to blare out. Poppy has created an army style circuit. The girls were expected to vault, forwards roll and crawl over and through all various terrains and things. After Poppy called a seriously aggressive but also seriously dangerous, in Tegan's opinion, LaCrosse game. During this game Poppy stood on the sign lines shouting encouragement -which was more insulting judgements that pushed the person they were aimed at to do better - and ordering them to be more fierce as they played. Similarly Poppy also made up and taught her own version of the New Zealand Rugby teams' Haka for Abbey Mount. -line break- It appeared however Poppy's aggression makeover worked as the next game Abbey Mount Vs Bodley Manor they won by 3. Meaning Mrs Kingsley mentioned it in assembly again the next Friday. \"Congratulations once again to our under 18 LaCrosse team who beat Bodley Girls on Saturday, 5 - 2. Well done\" she praised them and the school showed their support with a round of applause -line break- The next Saturday was the quarter finals against Oxley School - away, which ended in another glorious victory and the team were recognised in assembly by going up to the front and shaking Mrs Kingsley hand as she praised them individually. -line break- After another week of vigorous training in extra sessions, Abbey Mount thrashed Our Lady College and made it through to the finals with a 6 - 0 victory at home on the Saturday. The next Friday, Mrs Kingsley, again brought up the team's success. \"And the ground breaking news is that Abbey Mount is through to the LaCrosse Championships final!\" Mrs Kingsley stated jovially while the whole school celebrated whether it be through clapping, screaming or whooping they showed their school pride.[Chapter 7] Tegan slowly stirred from her sleep. Coming round gently after a good 10 hours sleep she felt quite contented. As she began to wiggle she heard the dawn chorus chuntering on and decided to get before she wasted a good day. Opening her eyes- \"CHRIST!\" Tegan shouted once her hazel orbs fluttered open to see (from left to right) Poppy, Kate, Josie, Kiki and Drippy stood in a hunched circle around her as they loomed over. \"That's a scary sight to wake up to\" the blonde and slightly unkept beauty in her sleeping added \"Do you know you sleep like a mummy?\" Drippy asked nibbling on a Wagon Wheel \"What?\" \"You cross your arms over your chest and rest your hands on your shoulders, like a mummy\" \"Oh that kind of mummy\" \"Did you think she meant the birth giving kind?\" Josie asked and Tegan nodded in response as she yawned \"What were you all creeping on me in my sleep for anyway?\" Tegan asked \"It's the 18th\" Kate told her \"Shit!\" Tegan sat up straight in one snap movement still in pouch like sleeping bag. \"Exactly! Come on Missy, get a shower! We are gonna make you look gorgeous!\" Poppy squealed clapping her hands as Josie and Kiki undid the sleeping bag, pulled Tegan (who was only covered by panties and a massive red, blue and green checked shirt, that was baggy and huge) out of it and to her feet before thrusting her towel and toiletry bag at her and shoving out the door, slamming it closed behind her. \"Guys?!\" Tegan sounded sleepy but still exasperated. After a moments contemplation she decided to not demand they let her in and trundled off the bathroom. Once there she turned on the shower, letting it warm up as she combed the lugs out of her hair and stripped. Stepping under the warm stream off water, Tegan slowly felt herself wake up. Soon enough she'd shaven, washed and scrubbed her body with 2 new products from Soap & Glory's sweet lime range. Moving on, after that she used a tea tree and cucumber shampoo she deep conditioned her hair using a matching flavoured mask. Once Tegan washed that out she shut of the water and got out, wrapping herself in a fluffy bathrobe as she cleaned her face, brushed her teeth and teased a comb through her, now so much softer, hair. After that she moisturised with body butter from the same sweet lime set and let it soak in before plodding back to her room. She opened the door to the dorm and saw Kate and Kiki now dressed, Josie having gone back to bed and fallen asleep and Poppy and Drippy awake and in their pyjamas. \"Oh there you are! Come on! I've picked the perfect outfit for you!\" Poppy jumped off her bed and skipped towards Tegan as she entered \"Looks Pops, I appreciate what your trying to do but I'm going to do this my way\" Tegan smiled a small smile, trying to soften the blow \"What why?\" \"Because despite trusting you implicitly, you and I have different styles, hence a different idea of suitable date clothes\" \"Ok\" she sighed \"I'll run it by you before I leave to see if there are any glaring fashion no-no's and you can still help me with my hair\" \"Fine\" \"I'm sorry Poppy its just I like what I wear to look nice to me not just appealing to everyone else\" \"Is that just restricted to just clothing or?\" Kiki joined \"We already know the answer to that Kiki\" Kate added \"Yeah we know baby Tee wants Harriet to become a sheep, reckons it'll look nicer\" Drippy added \"Look anythings better than that horse face she's got\" Tegan defended \"True\" Josie mumbled, waking up again. \"I hate horses\" Poppy came out with \"I mean they're not cute they have a face only a mother could love\" she added \"Still got one up on Harriet then\" Drippy chuckled and the others laughed too \"Drippy! Hush, we don't make 'mum' jokes, they're nasty\" Tegan told her off lightly while laughing \"Horses pull it off better though\" Kate mused aloud \"What mum jokes or a horse face?\" Kiki asked and more giggles spread through out the room. After a few bad mum puns and jokes created off the top of their heads', Tegan began to got ready. Quickly applying her usual: concealer, BB cream, mascara, Tegan changed it up a but with winged eyeliner and a strawberry tinted lip crayon before pulling on the outfit she'd mentally planned during her shower. Slipping on the high waisted, boyfriend jeans that were the very blue kind of denim, she rolled up the leg ends so they sat an inch or so above her ankles. She then put on a bralette top that was made out of a black fabric with a scarce and spread out floral print of pinky/orange and pale red roses and rose petals on it. It had a silky feel to it but had no other embellishments. Pulling on a pair of white trainer socks and low top, canvas, converse in white that were loosely laced up, Tegan had almost finished. \"Hey Poppy? Can you put my hair up in a bun please\" she asked and her brunette copy bounded over, ushering her to sit. Poppy working for about 10 minutes. Combing Tegan's hair, pulling it up and shoving bobbles and pins in her hair before stepping back. \"There\" Poppy smiled and Tegan went to examine her hair. The brunette had managed to secure in her hair in a immaculately neat bun that was deceiving small. Poppy having compressed Tegan's fine hair even more so it sat in bun no bigger than Tegan's clenched fist in her head. Finally Poppy had left her feathered fringe out the bun and parted on the side of Tegan's face so her it was softly framed by he silvery blonde waves. \"I'm going to go email Rubes, I'll see you later and I want all the deets!\" Poppy gushed running out the room. Tegan smiled and pulled her oversized white/cream thin knitted cardigan on. It fell to her mid calves, the sleeves were rolled over in massive loops and it had massive square pockets. The knit pattern itself was fancy as it comprised of a variation of vertical knitting, right diagonal knitting, mesh knitting and horizontal knitting and left diagonal knitting in a repetitive cycle. Drippy then walked in (she and Kate had left a while ago, not long after Tegan'd started getting dressed). \"Where's Poppy?\" Drippy asked quietly as the room, minus Drippy and Tegan was only occupied by sleeping Josie as Kiki had went to Biology to dissect something and photograph it to use it as proof in a Essay she was writing for a project. \"You just missed her, she's gone to the computer room\" Tegan smiled, grabbing a dark brown, leather satchel from under Drippy's bed as she began looking for the stuff she needed to put in it. \"Oh, drat. Anyway it's nearly 11 - you've got to meet lover boy, soon. Hurry! I'm going to get my 11 O'clock Wagon Wheel, I'll get Poppy on my way back\" \"Ok\" Tegan affirmed. As Drippy had been speaking she'd packed her back with: Tissues, comb, hand sanitizer, small drawing pad, small tin of coloured pencils, a pencil, a rubber and her purse. \"You ready?\" Drippy asked as Tegan fastened the bag and threw it over her shoulder. \"Yep\" she slid her phone into her pocket. Once they were out the room, the door having clicked shut, Drippy threw her arms round Tegan, nuzzling her face into her arm because of the height difference. \"I can't believe it! My baby is growing up!\" Drippy cried, still hugging her as they began to walk. \"I'll always be your baby, I promise\" Tegan hugged her back \"And you promise to stay loyal to the Nunnery regardless of what bribery Mr Kingsley offers?\" \"Jesus, Drippy! It's our first date! I'm not not going to go jump straight in to bed with him …\" \"I would\" Drippy confessed \"… yes, well you would. But don't worry I will stay true to the Convent and remain as pure as the Virgin Mary, I swear\" \"A what vent?\" \"A Convent. It's the proper word for a Nunnery\" \"Oh\" \"In fact I'm not even sure Nunnery's a real word\" \"Oh shut up Miss Smarty-Pants\" Drippy tsked and not a moment later they found themselves in reception. \"This is where I leave you\" Drippy began dramatically, letting go of Tegan before moving to stand in front of her and grabbing her hands. \"Yep. Enjoy your 11 O'clock Wagon Wheel, Drippy\" \"What? Knowing baby Tee is alone in the big wide world with some undeniably hot but still possible murdering Psycho. I won't be able to enjoy anything until you are back, safe and sound and if you're not, you'd better warn Freddie, he'll have me to answer to! If so much as one hair is misplaced on that pretty little head of yours I'll have his guts for garters, his brain for candle wax and his intestines for drapes, ok?\" \"Ok, I'll warn him.\" \"Bye Tegan. Enjoy yourself, have fun\" Drippy hugged her sincerely this time. Immediately Tegan reciprocated, humming an agreement. Once they pulled apart they smiled at each other. Drippy smiling like a mother would smile as she sent daughter to school for the first time and Tegan smiling the care free, you-worry-too-much smile of the daughter. \"Bye, Tee. You lucky so and so\" Drippy said walking towards the kitchens \"See ya Drippy you cheeky varmint\" Tegan retaliated with a giggle as she signed out and wandered towards the school's grand entrance doors. Strolling along the gravel path at a leisurely pace, Tegan found herself approaching the little road where she could already see Freddie's car parked. She could saw he was perched on the bonnet from the distance she was. As she got further along the little exit road the exit road the gravel became pretty much none existent, just becoming a few stones and gravel dust. \"Ah, Freddie Kingsley nice to finally see you when I'm not delirious and half naked\" Tegan greeted as she approached him, veering off little road and on to grass where he'd parked \"Don't speak to soon and is it wrong for me to say I'm just a teeny bit disappointed\" Freddie teased, getting of the bonnet \"Well I'd personally say no but Drippy has told me to pass on the warning that if 'a hair is misplaced on that pretty little head of mine she'll have your guts for garters, brain as candle wax and intestines for drapes' and that I have to stay loyal to our Convent so the getting naked bit might have to wait\" she raised her eyebrows and Freddie's eyes widened in mock horror at Drippy's threat \"Come on Tike lets hit the road. Call me old fashioned but I actually do quite like living and the death Drippy has planned sounds pretty grim\" he said while opening the door and climbing in the driver's side while Tegan got in the passenger seat \"She was been serious too\" Tegan let out a laugh and went to clip herself in. Just as she was about to buckle up, Freddie's hand caught her's stopping her from fastening her seatbelt \"For some one who 'quite likes living' you're really asking it for it. Remember it was just if a single hair was out of place\" Tegan emphasised 'single hair' \"Do you want to drive?\" He laughed before offering \"Drive? Freddie I. Am. Tegan. Not Poppy\" she spoke slowly as if speaking to a child and Freddie looked amused \"That means, I can not drive - I'm still only 16. I've not had a single driving lesson in my life. Only Poppy, in our dorm, has her license\" \"Your still 16? When's your birthday?\" \"July 6th\" \"Awe! Is that why they call you baby Tee?\" He pinched her cheek \"Yes and remember a single hair. If that bruises your a dead man\" Tegan playfully narrowed her eyes, referencing Freddie's pinching of her cheek. Freddie suddenly dropped her cheek as it was poisoned and pretending to heavy breath in fear as he leaned against his closed door, a hand over his chest evoking a giggle fit from Tegan. Her laughter caused chuckling from him as if it was contagious, moving to sit properly in his seat. \"Oh god, Tike … seriously though - you want to try driving?\" He asked, regaining his composure \"I can't drive\" \"I'll teach you\" \"Then it won't be death by Drippy you'll have to worry about. It'll be me splatting us in to a tree\" \"Come on\" Freddie opened his door and got out. He walked round to her side where she still sat in the car. Freddie crouched down and rested his folded arms on the passenger side door, his head resting on his overlapped hands \"Not getting out?\" \"No. I'll either kill one or both of us or completely wreck your car\" Tegan protested and as soon as Freddie opened his mouth to speak she jumped in and continued with: \"And its a very pretty car. I'd hate to see it ruined and if we crashed they'd tell your mum and she'd know you were fraternising and … AHHH! FREDDIE! PUT ME DOWN!\" Tegan started off slowly but upon seeing Freddie stand, a mischievous smirk on his face sped her talking up and when he reached into the car, grabbing her waist, lifting her right out of the car and throwing her over his shoulder she began to scream. He walked over to the driver's side and set her down. \"Rude, if Drippy had seen she-\" Tegan began in mock anger and know-it-all fashion but Freddie laughing stopped her \"We'll I'm still alive that means Drippy hasn't seen so get in the car\" he instructed lightly. Tegan reluctantly got in the drivers side and Freddie, hopped into the car - not even opening the door and took the seat she was sat in moments ago. \"Right assuming you know your left and right?\" He asked and she raised an eyebrow as to say: 'Are you being serious?' \"Indictor here. Pedals, left to right go: clutch, brake and accelerator. I'll tell you how hard you need to press on them when the situation occurs. This is the hand brake and this is the gear stick.\" \"I'm not a total idiot I know what's what I just don't know how to actually use them - like all at once! How am I meant to multitask that well?!\" \"Just go. I'll help you if you need it\" \"I need it now!\" \"And you said you wouldn't be getting naked\" he smirked being purposefully dirty minded \"Shush up! I need help!\" \"You'll need the keys\" Freddie lifted the car keys up and Tegan rolled her eyes taking them. -line break- After a shaky start, Tegan was getting the hang out of it but the car was making a real unhealthy noise and Freddie was just laughing. His arm was draped over the back of her seat and his fingers were playing with the whisps of baby hair that were all curly and fluffy and too small to pull up into the bun. Tegan found very distracting but managed to keep her eyes on the road just about. \"What's wrong with it?\" Tegan shouted over the wind \"It? It? It's not the car it's you!\" He shouted back \"What?!\" \"Have you ever thought about changing gear?\" \"Oh, shi- Your supposed to be helping me!\" She cried he merely laughed and told her to: \"Turn right here\" as he changed the gear for her. Surprisingly enough they arrived in one piece but Tegan refused to park the car for fear of scratching it so stood on the pavement as Freddie did it. Once he was done he jumped out the car, landing right by her. \"You like doing that don't you?\" Tegan smiled \"It's the most macho thing I can do\" \"Wow I'm thinking this is a bad idea already\" she teased, turning and walking on as Freddie caught up, slinging an arm around her shoulders - holding her to his side. \"Yeah probably was. Hey, how about a race?\" \"Race?\" \"Yeah you know people go against in each other in an attempt to get to a specified location quickest?\" \"I know what a race is but where to?\" \"Er … hey where you going?\" Freddie asked as dashed out from under his arm and ran down the street. Turning around while still running she shouted: \"I don't know! But it's a race!\" \"Oh your on!\" He smirked and sprinted after her. They ran down the Main Street dodging the few people that were out and about and zigzagging around benches and trees. \"Run! Run! As fast as you can! You'll never catch me, I'm the ginger bread man!\" Tegan shouted still running \"You sure about that?\" Freddie asked running backwards as he passed her before whipping round and taking off. \"HEY!\" She giggle-yelled. She followed Freddie up a side street that had the steepest hill she'd ever seen. She saw Freddie stop at the far entrance on the peak of the hill, throwing his hands in the air shouting: \"WIN-NER!\" Tegan laughed at the odd but undeniably attractive company she had before running up to him, purposely pushing him aside as she over took. \"Hey! That's unfair!\" She heard Freddie cry but continued to run down the steep hill before coming to a stop and sitting on a bench that was nearly at a 90 degree angle because of the hill. The bench was actually two benches next to each other and she perched on the one that was furtherest away. Freddie jumped and sat on armrest of first bench. He and Tegan exchanged a small smile before he dropped down to sit on the bench and sliding down to end of it. An armrest now only separated them and he recreated her pose of the crossed legs. Tegan shook her head a giggle escaping before sliding down her bench to the other end. Freddie got up and quickly jumped to sit on the end of the other bench, Tegan at the far end. Freddie didn't grasp the armrest and allowed the angle of the bench to slide him slowly towards her. He turned to look at her to find her already looking at him. There was silence for a moment until their laughter broke the air. \"I won\" Tegan teased as they both got off the bench and started walking down the street. She slung an arm over his shoulders \"If you say so\" Freddie put an arm around her waist. \"I do\" \"You're too cute Tike\" \"I try\" she shrugged stirring laughter up again. After a short walk they ended up on the shingle beach. They exchanged sweet nothings and made idle, light hearted chat on the way and continued as they found a spot to sit. They say down next to each other, their knees drawn up as Tegan wrapped both her arms around the front and back of his waist - enveloping him. Freddie however put one arm around her shoulder, holding the blanket he'd brought over her to keep her warm and the other on rested on her knee closest to him whip holding the other end of the blanket, that swaddled them both. \"…so she's pretty much travels all over the world for a majority of the year. I mean the last time I spoke to her, which was about the a week ago, she's was in … Oslo? I think. And I was an IVF baby from a donor so I don't have a dad as such. I mean, of course I have one but I don't actually have one if you get what I mean and … I'm completely babbling on and speaking for the both of us. Feel free to shut me up\" Tegan thought aloud after she and Freddie talked about their upbringings \"It's ok. I bet it was weird not having a dad to speak of at all\" Freddie asked curiously \"Not weird but I'm not used to any different. I am like super protective of my mum though, like if you even dare …\" Tegan let go of Freddie's front (something he whined at) and lifted her hand up, and used her pointer finger to imitate slitting throats while making a cutting noise with her tongue to symbolise she'd kill anyone who even thought about offending her mum. \"Well remind me never to get on your bad side\" Freddie joked and the both let out small breathy laughs of agreement and then Freddie added: \"But the thing … I'm pretty sure you don't have one\" at this Tegan looked down and blushed. A minute or two passed and she worked up the courage to peek at Freddie while he stared out to see. She did admiring his side profile until not a moment later when he looked back at her, their eyes meeting and Tegan blushed, suddenly becoming very interested in the sea. Freddie blushed a little too, not as much as she did but enough to be noticed. After a while they got a little nippy and with lunch approaching they decided to get some food. Strolling back over the beach and though the two they had a quiet conversation about the things they passed that they liked, for example Tegan saw a Gnome decoration in someone's garden that she thought was cute. Simultaneously though they all so played the game of every-person-you-make-up-a-far-fetched-back-story-for-what-they-doing. They came out with some corkers, like Freddie saying a woman putting out her cat was actually a demon who was had a feline allergy and as soon as it smelt cat in sneezed a magical sneeze that revealed it's demonic reality. Or Tegan who claimed the post man who rode past with parcels in his basket was actually a serial goat killer who believed in the Renaissance cure of a Bezoar stone and now his Aunt had got a serious malady of gout she needed the stones (that were supposedly found in the stomach of 3 eyed goats) to even have a hope of recovery. Once they reached the pub on the hill overlooking the water they quickly went in and grabbed a seat. The local place was quite busy. It was very quaint and possessed a great positive atmosphere. \"I'm just going to nip to the loo\" Tegan smiled, getting up \"Ok I'll get us some drinks. Coke?\" Freddie asked \"Yeah, Coke's fine\" Tegan disappeared off to the toilet and Freddie the bar. In the short time Tegan was gone Freddie had got the drinks and returned to the table. As she sat down she noticed that Freddie hadn't got himself or her straws. \"Where's the straw?\" She asked, slipping off her bag and placing in between her feet. \"Straw? What are you 7?\" He laughed, sipping his drink \"Hey! Your never to old to have straws\" \"Ergh, I disagree\" he shrugged and she gasped, placing a hand over her chest as she question in false horror: \"What even the reusable windy ones with all the loops and curves?!\" \"Yep even those\" \"Well I never. I never thought Mrs Kingsley would let her son drift and become such a, a … satanist!\" \"Oh of cause because we all know old red horned Jin has a thing against straws.\" \"Cerberus does\" Tegan took a sip as she referred to Matron and Freddie chortled \"I'm being serious! A first year bought one from of the shops down here the day of the social and when Matron found it she snapped in front of the kid's face and yelled at her for keeping 'plastic treachery' \" \"Really?\" \"Uh-huh. The kid cried\" Tegan finished just as her stomach growled \"Hungry much?\" Freddie asked \"I only had a slice of toast for breakfast\" \"I'll go and get us something and get you a straw\" Freddie stood up \"Ok. Here take this. You can't pay for it all\" Tegan grabbed her bag from under the table and got out her purse, opening it as Freddie protested: \"It's a pub meal it's hardly going to brake the bank\" \"But still I have to contribute in someway\" she held a £10 out to him. \"You are contributing by been fabulous company\" he smirked before walking off to get food \"I'll make sure you get this somehow!\" She called after him \"Yeah yeah\" was his only response -line break- About 15 minutes later Freddie returned with a plate of chips and buttered bread in hand and tomato ketchup and straw in the other. \"Here you go Tike\" he set the plate down. \"You took your time. I thought they were making you cook whatever it was you'd ordered\" Tegan smiled and plucked the straw from his grip. \"Thank you\" she smiled and placed it in her drink. \"Chip butty?\" Freddie asked and Tegan nodded \"Make it for though … I can't be bothered\" she whined as she sipped her drink threw her straw \"Sea air taken it out of you, has it?\" Freddie teased and began to make them a Chip Butty each. Tegan made a noise of agreement, propping her head in her hands with her elbows resting on the table. \"Here\" he held the unhealthy yet delicious snack out to her. \"Thanks\" she smiled taking it. They both bit into their Butty's carefully and chewed slowly. They swallowed before talking again. \"Oh that's a nice feeling. Food in your belly when your famished\" Tegan over exaggerated evoking a chuckle from Freddie. \"Famished? … hang on\" he said licking his thumb and wiping the side of her mouth to remove a little excess butter that had collected. His action caused a smile and a blush from Tegan before she began: \"You know this is one of the best days ev-\" she didn't get to finish as Freddie leaned across and kissed her. The kiss was sweet and chaste and only lasted a few seconds before they pulled away, grinning like Cheshire Cats. \"The best day I've ever had\" she corrected herself \"There's something about you Tegan Wills. Every moment I'm with you I catch my breath\" Freddie admitted looking deep into her eyes. Tegan looked back before glancing at his lips and then looking back up again. Then subconsciously she lifted her hands so they were around his neck and Freddie leaned in again, one hand finding her waist and the other her chin as they kissed again, with more passion and love this time. It was a lot less innocent than before. -line break- Tegan drove them home again. She wasn't convinced it was an entirely good idea though as she was currently so giddy she could hardly sit still. Freddie was messing with baby hair again and occasionally moving stray bits of fringe from her eyes as she drove. He simply say their and watched her, letting the image of her smiling with her hair whipping round her ingrain itself into his memory. He also dealt with gear changes as well - not to over power her on her first day driving and in quite an old car. -line break- \"Guys! You'll never believe it! We ki-\" Tegan squealed as she skipped in to the dorm. Much like the day when she burst in the apologise to Poppy, Tegan didn't read the situation before she spoke. Josie and Kate were sat on Kate's bed and Josie had her arm around her and held an A4 print out of some sort. Kiki and Drippy were on Josie's bed. They all looked sad and Kate even looked like she'd been crying. Poppy was no where to be seen. \"What's happened?\" Tegan asked, putting her satchel down on her sleeping bag. \"Nothing\" Drippy quickly answered \"Well that's obviously not true. What's going on?\" Tegan asked standing in between the ends of the two bed \"How was your date?\" Josie changed the subject \"Good. But what's go-\" \"Did you kiss?\" Drippy interrupted \"Er, twice. Guys what's happening?\" \"We can't tell her\" Drippy turned to the other 3 that were sat down. She spoke as if Tegan wasn't there \"Tell me what?\" \"We're going to have to now\" Kate pointed out, blanking Tegan too \"Guys, seriously\" Tegan was starting to get irritated \"She's had a lovely day, they've kissed - this'll ruin it\" Drippy reasoned \"What will?\" \"She has a right to know\" Kiki added \"It'll put a downer on her entire day though\" Josie took Drippy's side \"No, she needs to know!\" Kate finalised before turning back to a very confused Tegan. \"This is an email sent from Poppy, it was stuck to the door. Dear Ruby, you cannot imagine how retarded theses idiots are. They're a bunch of ugly losers who think a mani-pedi is some sort of Latin Greeting. I despise these village idiots but I have to pretend to like them so they will help me get out of this hell hole. I tried doing it on my own and it was impossible …\" Kate choked up, handing the letter to Drippy while Josie comforted her again. \"Still they're so thick they'll never realise and I'll be out of this asylum by the end of term\" Drippy finished folding the letter. Tegan'd eyes teared up but she didn't cry. \"That not all. There's one for you\" Kiki held out a sealed envelope. Tegan took it hesitantly, examining the small cream envelope with her name printed on the front \"It was taped to the door too\" Drippy added \"We haven't opened it. We figured it was best left to you\" Josie explained \"We can go outside and leave you to read it in private if you'd like\" Kate offered but Tegan smiled a sad, small smile shaking her head as she opened the envelope, pulled out the letter and opened it out. \"Then Rubes, there's Tegan. She's the one I told you about who has my face. She's so, just - ergh that she need's a whole paragraph to herself. She's a whiny little bitch who always sees the positives. She needs to wake up and smell the coffee, life isn't all rainbows and unicorns. Even worse is that I'm stuck with her. Apparently because we look the same it makes us the same - so no matter what I do we always end up sharing the blame. She's holding me down and making it even more difficult for me to leave. I'm trying to ditch the straggler though I promise, hopefully her prude whinging ass will be out my hair soon and I'll be back him to you and Roddy in Malibu\" Tegan read aloud and the others say in silence, Kate having dissolved into tears again. \"Has Poppy been up?\" Tegan asked after a moment \"Yeah she denied it, obviously\" Drippy seethed. Tegan merely nodded before going to leave the room. She got to the door before Kate called her back: \"Where are you going?\" \"To find Poppy\" Tegan turned to her \"What so she can feed you more lies?\" Kate asked spitefully \"No, so I can get her side of the story\" \"You don't think she writ these, do you?\" Kiki asked \"I don't know what to think\" \"She admitted it! She said she writ them but weeks ago. I mean she's obviously lying because they're dated today. But even if she was telling the truth she still writ them - she confessed!\" Kate sounded angry \"I just want to hear what she has to say for herself, that's all\" \"You're so stupid Tegan. Like Poppy said 'wake up and smell the coffee, life isn't all rainbows and unicorns'. Poppy's guilty. Just let her be. She's been rumbled if you go and see her she'll cry and play on your conscious or are you nOT SMART ENOUGH TO SEE THAT?!\" Kate's voice rose to a shout that made Tegan quiver and back up in to door. \"I'm not stupid Kate, nor am I not smart enough see that she may play me. But you forget Poppy is our friend and as her friends she deserves us to give her a chance. We have no proof Poppy actually sent those emails, she could have been hacked or anything. Either way I'm going to find Poppy and hopefully when I return you'll have found your sense of loyalty and morals\" Tegan replied in a steely tone before flouncing out the room. After searching the school thoroughly for a good 20 - 25 minutes to no avail, Tegan decided shed call to ask Freddie if he'd seen Poppy. Approaching his door, she went to knock but it flung open and a very angry and upset looking Freddie stood there. \"You've got some nerve\" was all he said and went to shut the door on her. Tegan quickly placed her foot in the way. \"What? What are you on about?\" Tegan asked \"The email\" he spat out poisonously \"Email? What email?\" \"Don't act like you don't know\" he tried to shut the door again but Tegan pushed it so it stayed open, more than a little irritated: \"I'm acting like a don't know because I don't so stop bullshitting me and tell me, what email?!\" \"Fine if your going to insist on keeping up your tangled web of deceit. An email from Poppy in reply to one you sent her, all about me\" \"What? I've never emailed Poppy. Why would I? I see her every day!\" Tegan cried in exasperation \"Really? Because although it's a separate reply and not attached to a previous message it gives a pretty clear indication what was said about me\" \"What was said about you?\" \"Like you don't know\" Freddie scoffed \"I DON'T!\" \"Fine then, if this is how you want to play it …\" Freddie disappeared into the room, leaving Tegan to loiter at the doorway before returning with a A4 print out. \"Oh, let me guessed taped to the door?\" Tegan rolled her eyes before continuing: \"Yeah we got one too and it's complete bollocks, I don't believe Poppy would say that stuff about us! Why would ours be fake and your's not?! It's not real Freddie! I swear\" \"Well you would say that! Your in this together! Ever since you arrived, you were like a team. A double act. Conspiring against Kate, Drippy, Josie and Kiki. Against the school … against me\" \"We. Are. Not. A. Team\" a singular tear rolled down the curve of her cheek. Freddie knew she hated being seen as just another Poppy and now he'd used it against in a low blow \"And … how dare y-you … I didn't … we're not … they're fa-fake … I … not real\" Tegan protested in short gasps as her breath caught in her throat and she began to cry but Freddie merely shook his head, reading out the email in his hands: \"Oh my god, Tegan! You are totally right! The headmistress' son'll be putty in your hands by the end of the week. He may be hot but like every English person here - very slow, no offence Tee. As soon as I'm out of here you can stop buttering him up to so he keeps Mrs Kingsley's sweet and you'll be free to find a real man. Come to Malibu and I'll find one for you. They are so fit back home not weedy, wanna-a-be surfers as you so eloquently put\" \"Are you being serious? You can't actually believe that! It's all so convenient! Who, ever when replying to an email basically repeats everything the first person say? Hum? Who? It's a set up! I didn't email Poppy about you - HELL! I didn't even email Poppy at all! And this wasn't her response!\" \"Go\" he sighed \"It's all scripted very cleverly to show you what I apparently said! It's not-\" Tegan continued but was cut off by Freddie slamming the door in her face. Tegan gasped, the draft from the door blowing her loose hair away from her face in a puff. A fresh wave of tears hit her. As it was the weekend pupils were walking round the halls freely and all of them that passed her stopped and stared for a moment or two, some managing to be inconspicuous about it - others not so much. Some looked concerned while others sniggered. Tegan simply stood, staring at the door, tears streaming down her cheeks and her lips ajar as she sucked in quick, deep breaths. Blood pounded in Tegan's ears as she began to feel light headed from crying. A voice broke her out of her inconsolable trance. \"TEGAN!\" She turned to see Poppy stood at the other end of the corridor. Poppy looked melancholy. Her eyes were classy and she wore a forlorn look. \"Tegan I didn't send those emails! I …\" Poppy rushed her defence \"Poppy\" Tegan said but the brunette carried on regardless: \" … Didn't swear! I'm sorry! I don't know …\" \"Poppy\" Tegan tried again but had no such luck \"… what your's said but whatever it was it wasn't true! I saw Freddie's when I came down to find you …\" \"Poppy\" \"… I didn't know what to do! Matron came before I could remove it and now you've split up and …\" \"POPPY!\" Tegan yelled and this time the American chatter box did fall to silence \"Yes?\" She croaked, tears starting to roll down her cheeks. Poppy had never heard Tegan shout like that and was convinced she was going to get a mouthful like she did from Kate, Drippy, Kiki and Josie \"I believe you\" Tegan smiled a watery smile as hot tears still danced down her face. Poppy at hearing this ran to Tegan and threw her arms around her. The two embraced in the middle of the corridor both weeping. \"I'm so sorry! What I wrote in that email - if it's the one I think it was - it was horrible and it was from weeks ago. I don't think that about you now I swear!\" Poppy wailed, her hands grappling and fisting at the part of Tegan's cardigan that covered her shoulder blade. \"It's ok\" Tegan consoled while venting her own devastation which manifested itself in heart wrenching sobs. \"But what about the other they hate me?\" Poppy pulled away, wiping her eyes before grabbing Tegan's hands \"They hate me too\" Tegan shrugged just before she hiccuped \"What? Why?\" \"I refused to believe you writ the email that led to a massive argument with Kate and I ended storming out and basically telling them to go, you-know-what-themselves, and their unfair judgements\" \"Oh Tee! You shouldn't have done that!\" \"Yes I bloody well should have! I'd rather be in the right minority as oppose to the wrong majority any day\" Tegan explained and Poppy hugged her again. \"Come on let's go back to the dorm\" Tegan suggested pulling away and taking Poppy's hand \"What are you crazy they'll skin me alive and probably just torture you but torture is still torture!\" Poppy cried as Tegan pulled her along the halls, her tears having subsided \"That maybe so but its our room too and besides its late. They'll have probably gone to bed or be to tired to argue now\" Tegan reasoned and Poppy gave in. Soon enough they were back at dorm. Opening the door slowly, Tegan went in first. Kate and Josie appeared to be asleep and while Drippy and Kiki were both awake neither of them acknowledged their presence as they walked in. Drippy was silently staring at the ceiling and Kiki was reading some book but it was obvious her mind was some where else. Kiki's fingers drummed an angry fast beat on the hard back book but no one passed comment. Following the near silence theme both Poppy and Tegan got ready for bed at their own pace. Tegan slipped into some fresh underwear and and a slim fit white vest top and short cotton shorts in dusty pink with elasticated waist and draw string tie fixed in a bow and small chocolate love hearts printed on them. She let her hair down, running a brush through it before leaving to wash and clean her teeth. When she returned to the room Poppy was still only just getting her pyjama bottoms on and hasn't washed either as was evident by her mascara tracks. Poppy looked up when Tegan re-entered and gave her a silent nod of 'goodnight' that Tegan returned. Tegan slipped down into her sleeping bag, for once actually grateful that the little nylon sack she slept in did cocoon her and allowed to escape the outside world. She knew it didn't really do that but the feeling of enclosure comforted her at that moment. Zipping herself in and pulling the drawstring so it was tight around her face she drifted off to sleep. -line break- \"… Jesus Poppy you're a proper psycho!\" Was the first thing Tegan heard when she woke up and it came from a very tired sounding Kate \"Help me get everyone up before it spreads!\" She then heard Poppy and then … Boom. Poppy was in front of her. Her face less than a few centimetres away. Tegan could hear Kate getting Kiki and Josie up as Poppy began: \"Tee! Tee you need to get up! I've messed up again! I didn't mean to but you have to get up!\" \"Ok, ok! I'm up calm down Poppy what's hap - hang on what's burning?\" Tegan asked, sitting up and as normal struggling to untangle herself from her sleeping bag. \"It was an accident I didn't mean to! I swear I thought I put it out!\" Poppy rambled on as Josie started shouting at Kate about waking her up until Kate replied with: \"THERE'S A FIRE!\" \"Fire?\" Tegan turned to Poppy as she clambered out of the sleeping bag, her and Poppy both now stood \"I didn't mean to! Help me get everyone out!\" She pleaded before dashing into the hall and waking everyone up. \"Ok, Drippy come on … drippy? DRIPPY?!\" Tegan turned to Drippy's bed to find she wasn't there. \"Shit! Wagon Wheels and ice cream! Drippy!\" She concluded in a rushed and jumbled sentence before sprinting out the room. \"HEY? WHERE ARE YOU GOING?\" Poppy shouted at her as she passed \"DRIPPY!\" Was Tegan's sole reply as she legged it bare foot through the school. Running down the steps and towards the kitchen entrance she saw smoke pluming out from under the door. Speeding up, Tegan heaved the door only to be slapped in the face by smoke. Choking she looked into the kitchens. They were a blaze - fire everywhere. 'Kind of looks like the climax of Bambi' Tegan's mind wandered as she brought a hand up to her face to cover her nose and mouth. She quickly snapped back to reality when she heard Drippy screaming. \"HELP ME! GET ME OUT! HELP!\" Tegan heard her frizzy haired blonde friend plead from inside the freezer \"DRIPPY!\" Tegan screamed and ran into the burning room. She managed to dodge most of the Flames, only occasionally nicking herself but the determination to save Drippy numbed the pain. Five or so minutes later she reached the freezer door and despite not having run that far the heat of the room and caused Tegan to sweat like a pig. Her skin had a damp shine to it and she was already starting to get caked in ash. Her hair frizzed from the heat and her eyes raw from the smoke. \"DRIPPY!\" She shouted through the door once she got there \"TEGAN?! OH MY GOD TEE HELP! I'M LOCKED IN!\" She heard Drippy's reply through the door. Tegan went to unlock the freezer door but the metal latch was scolding. \"AAAHHH!\" She screamed, letting go of the handle and jumping back with pain. \"Shit! DRIPPY THE HANDLE'S TOO HOT!\" Tegan hollered before choking some \"WHAT? SHIT! HOW AM I GOING TO GET OUT?!\" Drippy cried but instead of replying Tegan gritted her teeth and grasped the handle of the fridge, hearing the sizzling of her skin burning, and pushing. She managed to get the lock turned half way before dropping the handle, her hands in immense pain. \"AH, CRAP!\" She let go shaking her hands \"TEE GO! DON'T HURT YOURSELF! THE SMOKE'S NOT THAT BAD IN HERE! GET HELP!\" \"I'M NOT LEAVING YOU HERE, NOT HAPPENING! AND BESIDES POPPY'S GETTING HELP! SHE KNOWS WE ARE DOWN HERE\" Tegan resorted to clawing at the door, her finger tips quickly brushing against the lock. The action didn't cause so much pain and turned the lock a little bit each time. She heard Drippy shout something back but didn't catch it. Her head began to spin with the heat intensity of the room and smoke was getting to her lungs caused her to brake into a painful coughing fit. Soon enough she fell forward on to the fridge door, unable to support her own weight. Panting between her coughs and splutters as she began to cry, her eyes irritated by the bad stuff in the air. \"TEE? TEGAN, YOU OK?\" Drippy shouted but Tegan merely slid down the fridge door, still trying to scratch at the handle, mewling once a response before passing out in the middle of the centre of the blaze. -line break- Minutes earlier however when just as Tegan had sped past, Poppy was still waking everyone up, clearing the dorms and evacuating the building. Using a LaCrosse stick to smash the alarms cover she flung open all the doors, shouting variations of: 'THERE's A FIRE!' and 'COME ON! GET UP!'. Once she was happy she'd woken up as many people as she could be ordering people in every room she found to leave, regardless of whether they'd already been told, Poppy ran out the brining building at a sprinters pace. Thankfully no fire had reached that area yet and she managed to regroup with everyone who were already outside on the the decorative lawn. The fire service soon arrived in a great quantity as the fire had now spread to the through out all the buildings. The entire student body, the teachers, Mrs Kingsley and Freddie were stood on the lawn all clad in their night attire as Mrs Kingsley yelled the register over the sound of sirens, fire hoses and shouted orders of fire fighters. Holding a touch up to see the paper register, Mrs Kingsley bellowed: \"…Phoebe Faircluff?\" \"Here\" a girl raised her hand \"Susan Kasey?\" \"Here\" a hand raised \"Daisy Bevon?\" \"Here\" a small reply came, Poppy assumed the girl must've been towards the back of the crowd. \"Can't here you. Daisy?\" Mrs Kingsley tried again \"Here\" the girl, Daisy, replied louder this time \"Jennifer Logan? … Jennifer?\" Mrs Kingsley scoured the mass of girls, her eyes taking over the tired faces trying to find the distinctive hair of Drippy. \"Has anyone seen Drippy?\" Mrs Kingsley asked, gasps and murmurings were the only reply she got until a girl shouted up: \"I don't Miss, but Tegan's missing too\" \"Thank you. Anyone seen Miss Logan or Miss Wills? Come girls, Drippy and Tegan\" Mrs Kingsley asked but the worried whispering continued. At the mention of Tegan being missing Freddie tensed, something that didn't go a miss by Poppy and then the reality hit her like a tone of bricks \"Freezer. Drippy, Tee.\" She mumbled as the look of horrific realisation crossed over her face. \"DRIPPY'S IN THE FREEZER AND TEGAN'S TRYING TO RESCUE HER!\" Poppy bellowed before taking off, running back in to the inferno. A police man tried to stop her but failed and shouted a fire fighter to try but he also did not succeed. Poppy ran in to the blazing school fire men chasing after her as everyone else looked on in horror. \"DRIPPY! TEE!\" Poppy cried as she ran through the thick smoke, towards the kitchens and the freezer. \"TEGAN! DRIPPY!\" She bellowed. Meanwhile outside the teachers were trying to calm the girls. \"What's going on?\" One asked \"Will they be ok?\" Enquired another \"If Drippy and Tegan are in the kitchens then … oh my god!\" Some else wailed. Freddie tried to keep a brave face. Of course everyone was concerned for the three girls safety but he for one particular girl's more than most. Despite his argument with Tegan he cared for her deeply and the thought of her perishing in a fire, believing he hated her was in incomprehensible. There was silence for a good 5 or so minutes where everyone watched on in complete horror. The building no loner appeared to be a light but smoke still billowed out of it. Then out of one of the side doors came Drippy and Poppy. They were being escorted by two fire fighters, coughing and a little sooty. Although everyone was glad to see them safe and sound a collective gasp of petrification swept through the crowd. Where was Tegan? \"Oh my god! No!\" Kiki raised her hands to her face. The crowd were on edge for the next few minutes. Quiet murmurings and prayers being uttered while Poppy and Drippy were treated in the back of an ambulance. Suddenly a fire fighter burst out the main doors, in his arms an unconscious Tegan as he held her under knees and around her back. A united intake of breath from the crowd came as paramedics rushed over to them. Was she alive? Was the questing racing through their minds. Even Poppy and Drippy watched anxiously from there place sat in the back of the ambulance, it's doors open and heaped in foil blankets. Tegan looked more than a little worse for wear. The burns she'd sustained getting to Drippy and then trying to free her, littered her legs, arms and hands and were red and swollen, some even coming to blister. Her skin had a sweat sheen from the heat and she was positively caked in soot. It stood out really badly on her white vest top that had been burned off on the right bottom side from the hem to her hip while she was passed out in the kitchens. The fire man laid her down on the ground as a paramedic put a stethoscope over her scantily clad chest. The school looked on in the definition of terror, trying to gage the paramedics reaction. Freddie felt himself getting irritated by the suspense. He wanted to know if she was ok and he wanted to know now. After a minute of moving the stethoscope's head around on her barely covered bosom, the paramedic pulled back, turned to her counter part and said: \"27 beats per minute. I need 20 mls of Atropine and a ventilation mask ASAP\" the other paramedic rushed off to get what was required and the school sighed in relief before clapping. Mrs Kingsley, who'd previously been comforting Poppy and Drippy went to Tegan side. Kate, Josie and Kiki were also gathered there, crouching by her and Freddie stood off a little but still close enough to see if she was ok. The paramedics lifted her on to a stretcher and lifted that on to a trolley. Tegan was coming in and out of consciousness as Mrs Kingsley approached, laying a hand on her head and stroking her silvery blonde and a little damp tendrils of hair. \"You are very brave Tegan. Very brave indeed\" she smiled but only got an incomprehensible response in mumbles. \"Will she be ok?\" Mrs Kingsley turned to ask the paramedics and Kate, Josie, Kiki and Freddie all turned to catch the answer too. \"She's inhaled a lot of smoke and has multiple 1st and 2nd degree burns. Also her heart rate is still quite low but she should be fine\" the lady paramedic reassured, loading her into the back of the ambulance and the 5 smiled and sighed - happy she was ok. \"She'll probably be in over night and possibly some of tomorrow and will need medication for her burns but they shouldn't scar to bad or not at all\" the other paramedic, a man this one, added as Mrs Kingsley climbed into the back of the ambulance with Tegan. \"Freddie dear can you tell Matron I'm going with Tee to the hospital and if she would be as kind as to bring us both some clothes it would be appreciated.\" Mrs Kingsley smiled at her son who nodded before the ambulance doors were closed and they set off to the hospital. -line break- Freddie having told Matron the message, was currently in the now burnt foyer area of the school. A majority of the girls were still outside their parents coming down to offer moral support. As the fire fighters finished off cleaning the mess, Freddie glanced around the wreckage. \"What do you think happened?\" He asked one of the fire fighters. \"Oh, we don't know yet. But you're lucky it could've been a lot worse\" was his sole response as he moved on, clearing more fire destroyed rubble away. Freddie stepped forward but a sudden 'clink' under his shoe stopped him. Retracting his foot he looked down to see an 'I heart LA' lighter. Reaching down quickly he scooped it up before setting off to find Miss Moore. -line break- Poppy was wandering through the area of the school that for the majority had been unscathed by the blaze. \"Well done Poppy\" a girl said \"You saved us\" her friend added \"You were brilliant\" another added. Poppy smiled but as soon as she passed rolled her eyes. 'If only they knew' Poppy thought as she continued down the corridor only to be dragged into an alcove a moment later. \"Hey, I believe this is yours\" Freddie said holding her lighter. Poppy's eyes widened \"How did you kn-\" she began but he cut her off. \"Ti - Tegan mentioned you had a but of obsession with just lighting it. She's convinced you're going to be the next Guy Forks.\" He had to stop himself addressing her as Tike. \"Thank you\" a groups of girls passed \"Do you realise you could've killed us?\" He snapped but quieten bed down as another group of girls passed with a: \"Well done\" \"You could have killed all of us. Including yourself and your only friend here at the minute\" Freddie couldn't stop himself bringing up how selfish she'd been to Tegan, who he'd heard through the door had sided with Poppy and then she went off and nearly allowed Tegan to be killed. \"I didn't mean too. I thought I'd stopped it, I swear. I don't understand, ok? I heard footsteps and then I put it out. I was just so upset about everything. Everything I'd done with Kate and Josie and that lot and everything I'd caused between you and Tee and that fact Tee'd lost all her friends and … I wish I hadn't of done it\" she rushed out \"I really wish you hadn't done it too\" Freddie handed her lighter and walked away. Poppy watched him go but couldn't stop the small shout that left her. \"That email isn't real! Forgive Tee, please. She's crushed\" Poppy called and at her words Freddie stopped and tensed before shaking his head and continuing. Poppy sighed in defeat before leaving the alcove herself and heading towards her dorm. -line break- Freddie arrived back to his and his mother's quarters only to find Matron there. She was stood looking threw a book that had been left on the side board of the dresser. He cleared his throat and the older woman jumped before composing herself and setting the book down. \"Ah, there you are. I need your help\" she stated coldly \"Help? With what?\" Freddie's face contorted in to one of dire confusion \"Well you know your mother better than anyone. What does she like to wear?\" Matron stalked off and up the stairs to his mother's bedroom leaving Freddie to trail behind. \"Erm, clothes?\" He suggested once they reached the door way to his mother's room \"Well obviously but what clothes?\" \"Er\" \"Come on, pick out something you think she'd like\" matron ushered him in and towards one of the wardrobes. Freddie reluctantly pulled out one of his mother's magenta blouses and a pair of tapered black trousers. Matron had gone to find some shoes and underwear for his mum as well as toiletries. \"Come on, put it in here\" Matron ordered returning with what she'd set out for and a large carry on bag. Freddie did as he was told and packed the stuff away and matron zipped up the bag before handing it to him. \"Carry this\" she ordered and started out the room. Freddie stood their, bag in arms unsure of whether she wanted him to wait or follow. \"Are you going to stand there and gape or keep up?\" He heard her question rhetorically. Freddie quickly caught up to her and she led them out of the private house and through the school. After tackling many singed corridors, foyers and stairs they came to the dorm area. After a few more turns and bends down halls and the like they came on to a corridor where Josie and Kate were just leaving, what Freddie assume to be, their dorm. \"Girls\" matron regarded them \"Matron\" they nodded politely \"Do you girls happen to know where Miss Wills keeps her clothes?\" Matron asked \"Er, she shares Drippy's cupboards, matron\" Kate told her \"Yeah they're on your left when you walk in. Tee's clothes are on the right\" Josie added \"Thank you girls, dismissed\" Matron told them and they scuttled off as Matron opened the door that Kate and Josie had just come out of and closed. Stepping inside, Freddie felt more than a little out of place. He was forbidden from fraternising with the girls - a rule he'd already broken - but he'd never been in one of their rooms. It felt wrong. Freddie stood, tense in the very feminine room. The fact the Sun had begun to rose enlightened Freddie to the fact the girls room was a clean white but with posters, pictures and cut outs decorating the walls. It smelt weird too, in his opinion. He was used to the maximum of two girls in close enough range that he could smell them but in a room where 6 girls lived the smell of perfumes, fragrances and scents was over powering. 'So she really does sleep in a sleeping bag' Freddie mused seeing the bright blue sleeping back on the floor. He also peaked a quick glance at her art that was decorating the windowsill along with pillows, CD's, books … and a bottle of champagne? Freddie assumed the latter would belong to Poppy Matron quickly started rifling through the clothes on the right side of the cupboards that were to the left of the door. Matron all but threw a pair of coral red, high waisted, skinny jeans at him. He caught them on top of the carry bag he was resting on his raised lower arms. He caught a small breeze of Tegan's scent as it the bag, the contact expelling it from the fabric. Her smell a mixture of vanilla and brown sugar from her Soap & Glory product obsession and the other undefinable sweet smell of her hair product. A loose grey crop top made out of a opaque but light material was thrown down on to the jeans next. It had short sleeves and a scoop neck. Freddie glanced around the room, it was like stepping into a stock photo of a girl's room. As the stereotypes suggested their were clothes strewn everywhere, make up of all different kinds scattered on every available surface. Hair electricals, like straighteners and curling wands, were diluting the floor space and they'd been unplugged and not put away. Freddie carried on surveying the room until Matron placed a baby blue wired balcony bra that's edges were decorated with a generous strips of lace and matching panties on the pile of clothes he was holding. Freddie flushed, looking away. \"Erm, Matron?\" He asked and the older woman turned back to him a pair of white Decathlon pumps in her hand. \"What?\" She asked until she saw the reason for his sudden protest. Rolling her eyes she simply said: \"Mr Kingsley you've just spent half the night stood outside with girls in not much more than that and you've been to the school social which is well - an opportunity to cop more than an eyeful, shall we say. Besides they're Miss Wills, I thought that would make you very happy\" she emphasised the 'you' \"Er, what?\" Was the only response he could muster trying to look as confused as possible \"Don't 'what' me! It's my job to know exactly what's going on with my girls. And I know very well that yesterday you and Miss Wills went on a date but upon your return something arose with Poppy Moore and you haven't spoken since aside from the slagging match in the hallway yesterday evening\" Matron snapped before continuing while Freddie gaped like a fish. \"Now I didn't tell your mother because I know Miss Wills quite likes you but rest assured if I discover you've been unfaithful to her and promiscuous with Poppy Moore or anyone else I won't hesitate to turn you over, understand?\" Matron finished as she grabbed Tegan's toiletry bag. \"Understood\" he gulped \"Good now hold these while I find a bag\" she all but glared handing Freddie the shoes and toiletry bag.[Chapter 8] Tegan awoke slowly. Firstly she heard the constant beeping off what sounded like a heart monitor and then vaguely became aware of a pressure on her right pointer finger and a numbness in her lower legs, areas of her arms, palms and a few fingers. \"… her mother's on the way. Got to fly from Australia though\" a voice that sounded awfully like Mrs Kingsley said. \"Yes well she's lucky to be alive, stupid girl. Should have let the professionals do their jobs\" and that was definitely Matron. \"Yes but Noreen, Drippy's her friend and … oh, I think she's waking up\" She heard her headmistress say as her eyelids began to twitch and her body shuffle around as best it could with the large areas of numbness still present. \"I'll go and get a Doctor\" Tegan heard the door slam just as she opened her eyes. A bright white light was all Tegan could see so with a hiss she quickly snapped her hazel orbs back shut. \"Hello Tegan. It's me, Mrs Kingsley. Your in hospital but you're going to be ok\" and Tegan felt a hand stroking her hair on the front of her head. Trying again she opened her eyes more slowly. This time as well as a bright light she saw a blurry figure who was wearing one seriously bright magenta top. After a moment or two her vision focused and she saw Mrs Kingsley sporting a very relieved expression just as Matron and a Middle aged doctor with thinning hair and a beard entered. \"Ah, Miss Wills. Nice to see you finally awake\" the Doctor, a Mr Becket - according to his badge, said as Tegan tried to push herself into a sitting position but collapsed when her majority numb arms gave out. \"Oh no, they'll be none of that. Despite having recovered well from your very low heart rate and over exposure to CO2 you sustained 1st degree burns on your upper legs and arms and 2nd degree burns on your lower legs, arms and wrists, hands and some fingers.\" He read from the clipboard he was holding \"Ok?\" Tegan wasn't quite sure how to respond \"We've bandaged you up and their should be minimal or no scarring. You are free to go when your ready but you need to collect a cooling gel from the pharmacy on the way out along with some pain killers\" the doctor smiled before leaving. Matron spoke up next from the end of the bed \"I'd best get back to the school - let everyone no the good news\" she said although she didn't sound as enthusiastic as her sentence did and she too exited the room. Mrs Kingsley then turned to her. \"Well my dear are you ready to go?\" She asked \"Er, yes but um … do I have any clothes? If rather not return in a backless hospital gown\" Tegan joked \"Of course my dear but I'll have to help you\" at this Tegan did tense slightly but nodded \"Ok\" Mrs Kingsley pulled up Tegan's Mocha Week end bag that was in the style of a large handbag from under the bed. It was a structured bag with golden zips, buckles and fastens. \"Now I don't know what's in here. Matron and Freddie chose the clothes and if this hideous thing is anything to go by …\" Mrs Kingsley motioned to her startlingly bright magenta blouse \"… it could be a real shocker\" \"It is a bit bright\" Tegan agreed as Mrs Kingsley pulled out her high waisted skinny jeans in coral red, grey crop top, white Decathlon pumps … and a matching 2 set of baby blue, lacy underwear. Tegan blushed and even Mrs Kingsley looked slightly unsure. \"Oh, well … er, I'm sure Matron packed this - no need to worry. Freddie won't have, erm …\" she tired to smile but Tegan thought the headmistress herself wasn't convinced. After about half an hour, Mrs Kingsley had finally finished help Tegan get dressed. Her bandages did show on her arms and hands as well as having one peaking out from under her left Jean leg as her jeans had the bottoms rolled up so they sat above her boney ankles. Then after washing her face with wet wipes (because she couldn't wet her hands), a very awkward teeth clean and having to have help to apply deodorant, Tegan found herself sat on the bench waiting for Matron to come and collect herself and Mrs Kingsley. Her weekend bag was at her feet and Mrs Kingsley had gone to fetch her prescription. \"Here you are\" Mrs Kingsley came out, sat next to her and handed her a paper bag with the cooling gel and pain killers in. \"Thanks\" \"You know I love your hair\" Mrs Kingsley made conversation as she seized a lock of the silvery waves, playing and fiddling with it. Tegan gave a soft chuckle at her actions. As Mrs Kingsley had done her hair, it was simply just brushed back from her right temple in its lovely tousled waves that swung round by her mid-ribs. \"I always wanted a little girl so I could play with her hair. I always envisioned playing hair dressers and plaiting hair and bobbling it and …\" \"Getting your hair tangled beyond saving and having to cut out bobbles and clips\" Tegan delivered the reality in a jovial fashion and Mrs Kingsley laughed \"Well yes and that, but it's all part of the fun. I suppose that's why I'm so glad Freddie has long hair - I like to mess with it just to annoy him\" \"Sounds like something I'd do, mess it up because it annoys him\" \"He always gets the face on and ignores me afterwards for about an hour\" \"Really? Oh my god!\" \"Ssh, though. If he found out I'd told anyone he'd kill me\" Mrs Kingsley laughed just as Matron entered the hospital car park, Heavy metal music still blaring out and only stopping when she turned the engine off as she pulled up right in front of them. \"I didn't know you were into heavy metal, Matron\" the headmistress teased, taking Tegan's bag and helping her to her feet. \"I'm not. It was some students idea of a joke. I've got no volume button and can't remove it\" Matron leant across opening the passenger door and moving the passenger seat forward. Tegan giggled slightly as both Mrs Kingsley and Matron lowered her into the back seat. She shuffled over slightly - having regained feeling in some areas - as Mrs Kingsley put up the passenger seat and sat, shutting the door. Clicking in, they quickly set off the screaming music piercing the air once again and causing two of three occupiers to wince. 'She's obviously gotten used to it' Tegan thought, noting Matron's lack of response to the music as her head began to sting. \"Miss … Miss … MISS!\" Tegan cried, getting Mrs Kingsley attention. The woman turned in her seat, her face showing her discontent at the music \"IF YOU USE THAT HAIR PIN AND PUSH IT IN TO THE THE TAPE SLOT AND APPLY ENOUGH PRESSURE, IT SHOULD TRIGGER THE EJECT FUNCTION!\" Tegan hollered, trying to get her point across. The headmistress nodded her head, taking her hair pin out of her hair and doing as she was told. The machine spat out the tape, all the film chewed and the music stopped after a whirring noise was produced \"What a relief\" Mrs Kingsley sighed and Tegan nodded \"Good! I hope it shows them little harlots that their stupid prank hasn't done what they intended it to do the bast-\" \"Matron!\" Mrs Kingsley quickly cut her off \"Sorry\" -line break- \"… someone here knows exactly what happened last night\" Mrs Kingsley stated. She, Matron and Tegan had got back to the school not half an hour ago and after she went to change out of her horrendous blouse an emergency assembly was called. All the girls, most of whom's lessons had been changed and/or merged because of severe lack of classrooms, had been pulled out of lessons and we're now sat in the assembly hall in complete silence, no one dared talk - it was too serious a matter. Tegan was sat next to Poppy, still in non-uniform, sticking out like a sore thumb. As she'd waited for the assembly to begin multiple people had come over and wished her well and consoled her evoking a few teary spells that Poppy got her threw. \"What we're clear on is that this fire was no accident. If you have the sense to own up, no legal charges will be filed if not it will be passed on to the local authorities. You have until the end of the day to come forward\" Mrs Kingsley announced as everyone stood. Harriet then led the first row out and after the that the rows filed out in an orderly fashion of left then right, going back along the pews. Tegan found herself in the dorm changing into her uniform alone as Kate and the others had gone to whatever class could be taught in the school's current state. Having now fully regained feeling, Tegan felt the occasional twinge of pain but pushed threw it as she got into her proper school attire. As she was about to leave Tegan realised she hadn't picked up her drawing pad - which was a sure sign her mind was somewhere else because she nearly never left without it but with knowing Poppy was less than a few hours away to potentially becoming a wanted person by the police she felt like she could bust in to tears at any moment. Collecting her drawing pad from the windowsill she caught a look of Poppy looking extremely down as she sullenly moped alone towards a bench on the school grounds. Deciding lessons weren't important anymore Tegan picked up her pad, shoving it in her bed as she started to walk out of the school and the bench that Poppy was on. Reaching Poppy, after a slow 10 minute saunter, Tegan didn't bother with formalities and merely sat on the bench next to her. She noted on Poppy's knee was one of her school folders with a few sheets of paper on top and in her hand a pink pen with fluffy top. \"I'm going to confess\" Poppy said after a minute \"And I'm going with you\" Tegan replied simply and Poppy turned in her seat to look at her, shocked. \"What?! Tee! No! You have no part in this!\" Poppy protested but Tegan merely scoffed \"Poppy we've been a part of each others trouble since day one and there's no way - when facing the biggest trial of your life so far - I'm going to give up on you and let you face it alone\" the blonde explained \"But, but … what about Kiki and Josie and Kate and Drippy … what about Freddie?\" \"What about them? Kiki, Kate and Josie still haven't forgiven me and Drippy won't, at least not publicly until they do and Freddie, well. Freddie absolutely despised me\" \"No, I'm sure he doesn't. And besides Mrs Kingsley'll never belief you. She knows it can't be you\" \"It isn't a matter of what she believes it what the honour court decides and if I agree with your confession, implying I was also there she'll have to send us both regardless\" Tegan finished and the blonde and the brunette sat in silence for a while before Tegan spoke up again: \"What are you doing?\" \"Writing a letter to Drippy, Kate, Josie and Kiki\" Poppy shrugged \"Oh, apologise for me too please - I feel like we've come in and royally messed up their once perfect and steady school lives\" \"Yeah of course I will\" \"Hey, can I borrow a sheet of paper, I'd like to write one for Freddie. If I'm leaving I at least want him to know my side of the story.\" \"Yeah sure, you'll have to give it to Mrs Kingsley to pass on\" Poppy passed her a piece of paper and Tegan got on her drawing pad to lean on and a pen from her pencil case. Resting the paper on the pad she began: Dear Freddie How can I begin to say I'm sorry? You are good and honest and true and well I'm the opposite. But I'm learning so now along with Poppy, who you were right with about the fact we are a team. A double act. We are going to confess and although I wasn't present at the fire starting, Poppy and I, we came into this school together and we're going out of it together - the way it should be. I know this means I will probably have to leave here but I want you to know, I promise you I never wrote the email which Poppy supposedly replied too … Poppy, who'd been reading over her shoulder, grabbed the letter from her hands before scribbling down: And I promise too, that I didn't send that email (Poppy) Her writing stood out like a parent in a children's play area - so out of place but still with obvious belonging. Poppy writing was neat but but large, cursive and slanted to the left, Tegan's however was smaller, narrow, straight and not joined up. Tegan quickly finished her letter, the words flowing out of her and on to the page with no filter: You were never a ploy to help Poppy escape. When I got to know you and I realised how wonderful and different you are to anyone I've ever met. I've never felt this way before about anyone and I really need you to know that Love Tegan x P.S. I told you I'd find a way to give you that money some how Tegan finished before reaching into her bag again and pulling out her purse. Quickly she found the £10 note she'd intended to pay for the food with at the pub and she slipped it in to the letter once she'd folded it. Poppy handed her an envelope and Tegan smiled a watery smile as she slipped the letter and the note in the envelope before sealing it. \"Come on\" Tegan said, getting of the bench slowly. Having left her blazer in her dorm due the heat so she only had her 3/4 length sleeve, white school shirt on top and the fact her bottom half was clad in a skirt and ankle socks it meant pretty much all her bandages were on show. They climbed around ankles and lowers legs. They covered her wrists and palms in a boxer style. Together they made their way to Mrs Kingsley's office at a slow pace. Tegan seemingly fascinated by the edges of the envelope, tracing them absentmindedly with her pointer finger as she grazed her nail along it. Poppy meanwhile held the scroll right in her hand, her jaw set in a steely fashion. The differences between the two girls had never been to obvious. Tegan knew and accepted her fate and let her mind wander whereas Poppy stressed and debated and schemed all the possible endings and way outs. \"Everything will be alright Poppy\" Tegan reassured taking her hand \"Yeah but we are going to be kicked out\" the brunette reasoned \"If that's the price we pay its the pace we pay\" \"It's better to be in the right minority as oppose to the wrong majority, right?\" Poppy quoted her \"Right\" Tegan smiled as they reached the door of Mrs Kingsley's office. Poppy took a deep breath before knocking \"Come in\" the headmistress' voice called from inside. Poppy pushed open the door and entered, Tegan following and shutting the door. \"Oh, what can I do for you two girls. Poppy? Tegan?\" Mrs Kingsley asked motioning them to come closer. They obliged and Poppy took her lighter out and placed it on the desk. \"It's what I used to start it. It was an accident and I, er, thought I'd put it out but I guess not … obviously not\" Poppy voice began to crack as she glances at the semi-mummified Tegan while Mrs Kingsley looked shocked as she held the lighter. \"Oh Poppy. You realise what this means don't you?\" Mrs Kingsley asked. Poppy nodded and Tegan took this as a que to explain her presence: \"And that is why Miss I'm here. I wish to share Poppy's fate, whatever it may be.\" At Tegan's confession of wishes the headmistress looked even more shocked \"B-but, why? People will know it couldn't have been you\" Mrs Kingsley stuttered at the start \"True Miss, but if you'd let me finish. Ever since Poppy and I came to this school we've been branded a pair, whether that be rightly or wrongly so. We've been referred to as each other's copies, doppelgängers, twins - any synonym for the same, I can guarantee we've been called it. Now because of this, whatever we've done regardless of whether it was one or both or none of us we've always faced the consequences of those actions together. I personally don't believe it to correct that a school that was so keen to package us together would rip us apart when one of us needs the other. It's wrong. If you truly wanted us not to accept each others blame than it should have been the case from the beginning and as it was not, then it should be the case that we face whatever is to come - together\" Tegan explained in a eerily calm tone that chilled the room to silence \"Will we be expelled?\" Poppy spoke up first, shattering the bitter quiet \"The honour court will decide but I suspect you under- that you both understand that it's just a formality at this point\" Mrs Kingsley answered \"The weird thing is, and I know I speak for both of us here, we really did try to turn it around\" Poppy sniffed. Then both Poppy and Tegan did something they hadn't done since they feverishly denied the twin sister claims at the start of term. They spoke in unplanned unison. \"I didn't want to let you down. I'm so sorry\" they both confessed. Mrs Kingsley noted that almost as a defence mechanism they reverted back to acting like twins. Both Poppy and Tegan fidgeted nervously, hardly managing to stand still as their identical guilty faces and sorrow filled eyes flickered around the room, avoiding focusing on any one aspect for too long. \"I'm so sorry too, girls\" Mrs Kingsley smiled sympathetically, messing with the lighter between her fingers. Poppy glanced across at Tegan and gave her a reassuring nod. \"Erm, do you think you could maybe give to Freddie for me, please?\" Tegan asked setting the letter down and Mrs Kingsley looked shocked for a third time that meeting, looking between Tegan and the letter before refocusing on the lighter as the two girls left the room. Shutting the door behind them as they left, Kate walked past. \"I told her it was me. I'll be going to honour court and then I'll be leaving but this is for you\" Poppy held out the letter she'd wrote for the girls that was nearly rolled up like a scroll. Kate looked at the paper for a moment before her face turned sour. \"Well done, you finally got what you wanted. You must be overjoyed\" She spat out, making no move to accept the letter. \"And you?\" Kate turned to Tegan \"I don't get you. You're too complex. You act like your one of us and yet you side with her, someone who betrayed you. But then you did conspire against us in your twos own secret plan with Freddie. Now your leaving with Poppy I bet, out of some fake twin morality. What's going on with you Tegan, you seriously need to get your head straight\" Kate shook her head as Poppy spoke up: \"I couldn't be more unhappy\" \"Oh please, give it a rest - both of you\" Kate snapped before stalking away with great speed, not taking the letter. Tegan put a hand on Poppy's shoulder as Poppy unrolled the scroll to reveal the print out of the photo in the charity shop with loads of little stickers around it and a lengthy apology at the top. \"She's still a little hurt, that's all. Once she's come the her senses she'll see you actually mean well\" The blonde consoled but the Brunette merely shook her head, turning away. Tegan felt Poppy tense under her hold before she moved from her grasp and towards the wall of pictures that documented the schools achievements over the years. Looking to see whatever had riled Poppy, Tegan noticed that Poppy was staring at a framed photograph of the LaCrosse team from 1976 and the captain was … Poppy? Tegan was now extremely confused but when Poppy uttered a very hushed: \"Mom\" it'll clicked into place in Tegan's head. The story about why she was sent here, the reason a boarding school in England, why Poppy was so good at LaCrosse. It was all because her mum was the star captain of the champion side in 1976 for Abbey Mount. -line break- Tegan was sat on love seat she and Freddie had nearly kissed on, on the night of the social. She was sat in his place now though staring off down the hall. She'd left Poppy to have some privacy with her memories just down the adjoining corridor so Poppy could call her if she needed to someone to help her through. Poppy had taken the photo of her mum with her to relive her happy memories that had now turned bitter sweet while Tegan was just getting of the phone to her own mother, who not only knew about the fire but also the fact she'd been sent to honour court and up for expulsion and was devastated. Her mum was in tears, believing all Tegan's unhappiness to be her fault and that it would never have occurred if she didn't accept the 'selfish' promotion \"… yes, mum. Yes, I know but you have to believe me it's the right thing to do … no, I know … please don't get upset about this, its not your fault. Really … I didn't, I did the righ - no it's absolutely, categorically nothing to do with you … I'm merely … no. Ok. I love you too … no, trust me. I love you more … bye … bye\" She hung up, still clasping her phone in her hands. That's when she let the tears fall in silent sobs. She felt selfish for doing so when Poppy was down the hall mourning her deceased mother and here she was weeping over her mum being upset because of her. However she couldn't help it both the emotional and physical pain she experienced in the last 48 hours caught up with her. She'd lost all her friends - minus one but she herself was crying and Tegan's reasons for crying seemed so pathetic in comparison to Poppy's which made Tegan cry even more. She was about to be kicked out of a school she had grown to love, the person who she did love now hated her (Tegan had come to realise she did love Freddie) and she'd made her mother cry. It was all to much. She wished things would go back to how they were not 2 days ago, when she was happy and settled and not noiseless crying, alone and despised. Kate was right she was stupid and did need to get her head together. Harriet spoke the truth too, she was a horridious cow - and now everyone had suffered. She'd only just realised she was like a tornado, sweeping in and ruining lives. She was so caught up in her self-criticism she didn't even notice anyone else's presence until that person spoke up: \"Hey, I've been looking for you\" Tegan turned to see Freddie leaning against a pillar, the letter she'd asked Mrs Kingsley to give to him, opened and in his hand along with the £10. \"Hi\" she managed to get out, with out sounding too emotional though she was sure the tear tracks gave it away. For this reason, Tegan turned back round in her chair - not wanting herself to be seen crying for, what was in her opinion, such an unworthy reason. \"So you backed out of our deal?\" Freddie said, approaching her. \"What deal?\" Her voice was getting closer to breaking again as she turned her head to see him stood, pretty much next to her on the other side of the love seat. \"That you wouldn't fry my head\" he tapped the paper on his palm before placing it on the unoccupied space on the love seat \"Yeah\" Tegan sniffled, her emotions getting the better off her as Freddie sat, his body turned to face her as he leant over the back of the seat to be closer to her. \"But you poached my heart\" Tegan's resolve crumbled and the tears began to fall again, fast and hot down her already red cheeks. \"Hey, come on\" Freddie comforted, one hand being placed on her closest upper arm and the other hand's pinky finger's side went to wipe away her tears, that she was already attempting to remove herself to no avail. \"What if it doesn't have a moral? Or a success?\" He quoted from Alice in Wonderland. Once his hand had was wiped away all her current tears, he moved that arm, so it sat around her shoulders and then used both hands to caress her arm and shoulder soothingly. \"I think I just fell down the Rabbit Hole and found it\" She quoted back, biting back another sob and Freddie squeezed her gently. \"Poppy's found out her mum went here\" she whimpered, her exhale of breath uneven and patchy \"But isn't her mum -\" Freddie asked. He knew a bit of Poppy's life story from Tegan and could vaguely recall her mentioning Poppy and her reasons for coming to the school which involved her mother. \"Yeah, she went to this school and Poppy didn't even know … M-my mum hates me\" Tegan started, just wanted to get it all off her chest regardless of whether it was a sob story or seemed stupid. Freddie moved the hand on her arm, down to toy gently with her fingers that were clasping her phone. \"I'm sure she doesn't\" he reasoned, setting his head on her shoulder. \"She does, or at least she will do. She blames herself at the minute bu-but when she … she's the light-t … she's going to hate me for ever\" she took a few deep breaths in a failed attempt to calm herself as the tears began to stream once more \"Hey, hey. Shush, it'll be ok. Besides even if you do get expelled I'll be able to see you without it been forbidden fraternisation\" he squeezed her more tightly and pecked her head. \"You still want to see me?\" Tegan asked in disbelief \"Of course. Like you said in your letter: I've never felt like this about anyone before\" he smiled, nuzzling his head against her's. After a moment of two or just relishing in Freddie's comfort, Tegan soundless weeping subsided a little and she nodded her head uttering a sad: \"Well I guess it's time to face the music now\" reluctantly she stood from his grasp and wobbled towards the end of the corridor, Freddie trailing slowly behind - wanting to give her and Poppy privacy but not leave her. \"Poppy?\" Tegan turned on the corridor where she'd left Poppy. The brunette turned to look at her from where she was sat on the floor, back against the wall the picture clutched in her hands. She had puffy, red eyes and was breathing heavily. \"It's time\" Tegan gave a small smile and Poppy pulled herself to her feet, accepting a the hand that Tegan offered her to hold for comfort. -line break- In the honour court that afternoon, both Poppy and Tegan sat on adjacent chairs, their' hands still clasped. The entire school had gathered, with the exception of four faces: Kiki, Drippy, Josie and Kate. Tegan noticed their absence but didn't alert Poppy, for fear of hurting her even more. Mrs Kingsley was sat directly opposite the girls, looking a little upset. Harriet stood and spoke, officially beginning the session. \"It is with great regret and sadness that we call the honour court to session. It will henceforth be our job to objectively and dispassionately ascertain what happened that fateful night, that will henceforth long blight the memory of this proud institution. It's is your duty to understand the dark forces that drove a seemingly-\" Harriet began to rant \"Harriet, may I remind you that the honour court is no place for your personal grandstanding and that both Poppy and Tegan have a right to speak in their' own defence before the court, as a whole, passes judgement\" Mrs Kingsley interrupted her and Harriet begrudgingly sat down. \"Thank you, Mrs Kingsley\" Poppy began. Tegan squeezed her hand in reassurance before letting go as she stood, continuing: \"I won't insult everybody by trying to defend myself our my actions\" Poppy stopped, noticing Kate, Josie, Kiki and Drippy enter and take their seats. They smiled at her and then glancing behind her, presumably at Tegan. \"So, erm, I think it's safe to say I've, I've really messed up and I apologise profusely. But I'm also so grateful to you all. I tried really hard to get out of this school, in the process of which I ended up dragging several people down with me - some a lot more than others …\" Poppy glanced around at Tegan who smiled in reassurance from her seat. \"… and only now do I realise how much I want to stay. I've learned so much being here, being with all of you and in some ways being with my mom …\" Poppy said shakily and the school looked perplexed and shocked. Tegan quickly rose from her seat and placed her hands on Poppy's shoulders, standing to the side of her as she spoke. \"…who I found out was actually a student here\" gasps broken from the gathered crowd and Tegan felt Poppy tense in remorse so applied more pressure to her hold to offer comfort. \"I've had a whole in my heart for 5 years and somehow being here it's slowly started to heal. I know I may have looked like a California girl but in my heart I've discovered I really am an Abbey Mount girl\" Poppy finished and Mrs Kingsley began to tear up slightly. \"Mrs Wills?\" the headmistress nodded to Tegan. \"Erm, my defence is no where near as concrete or worthy as that just given but my sole consolation to you is that no, I didn't start the fire. But I'm still standing here on trial because from the moment I stepped on to this school's grounds I was part of a bundle. A double edition with Poppy Moore and that is why I'm here, because she shouldn't face this alone. It's not right. Now I ask you to try to consider what we've done and what Poppy did and consider the right thing. We both want to stay, to stay here and flourish and make friends for life but we can't do that if you choose to expel us. So please do the right thing, for us, and let us stay\" Tegan stressed the 'for us' part just as Harriet rose from her chair again. \"Objection! Sustained. The court will disregard the previous statements and perhaps, heretofore, we can begin the business. Can you tell us Miss Moore, in your own words, where were you on the aforementioned evening-\" Harriet was interrupted by Mrs Kingsley: \"Honestly, Harriet who else's words do you expect her to use?\" Harriet looked shocked. \"Just leave this to me\" Mrs Kingsley ordered and Harriet sat again, murmuring a 'right' followed by a louder 'Sustained' \"Poppy, were you in the cooks' sitting room on the night of the fire?\" \"Yes I was\" Poppy answered and Tegan noticed Kate, Drippy, Kiki and Josie whispering to the girls next to the them and then those girls whispered to the girls next to them. \"We're you there with permission?\" \"No, I was not\" \"Quiet please! Silence in court!\" Harriet instructed noticing the whispering \"Did you intend on starting a fire\" \"Not really\" \"Objection! Does the defendant mean yes or no?\" Harriet rose from her canoe again. 'She's like a strange Jack-in-the-Box' Tegan allowed her mind to wonder \"Harriet\" Mrs Kingsley warned, Harriet sat and Poppy clarified her answer - all the while the whispered murmurings persisted \"No I had no intention of actually doing it\" \"Was anyone else with you?\" \"No, not as far as I know\" Poppy answered Mrs Kingsley and Kate stood. \"I was\" she said \"I was\" Drippy came up next \"I was\" came from Kiki \"I was\" Josie piped up, also standing \"I was\" Tegan smiled \"B-but that's impossible! You were trying to -\" Harriet spluttered \"I. Was. \" Tegan deadpanned, cutting her ramble off \"I was\" \"I was\" \"I was\" Poppy smiled as all the girls in the room in dribs and drabs stood, declaring they were with her. \"I was\" \"I was\" \"I was\" \"I was\" Came multiple more cries. Tegan leant forward and whispered in Poppy's ear: \"See, I told you they'd come round\" \"Objection! Stop! Order!\" Harriet cried, standing from her seat and making furious hand actions in attempt to get people to sit back down. Now a majority of people were stood and it was safe to say Mrs Kingsley looked absolutely baffled. The line of 'I was' ' was reaching an end and it was left to one girl, Harriet's first year help. \"Come on\" the girl next to her whispered, shaking her arm \"I was\" Harriet's first year help declared and Harriet broke out in outrage. \"THIS IS RIDICULOUS! What are you all doing?! You're lying! They're are lying Mrs Kingsley! This is a conspiracy. You can't expel the whole year and they know that!\" Harriet protested and Mrs Kingsley slammed down her Gavel down. \"Be quiet, Harriet! … sit down everyone\" Mrs Kingsley demanded and everyone did, including Poppy and Tegan which left Harriet as the only person still stood. \"It's a black and white case! She has to be expelled!\" Harriet held her file in Poppy's direction before turning it to Tegan and saying: \"And if this one refuses to stay without her then she has to go too! Miss Moore set fire to the school, endangering all our precious lives! She walked in their, lighter at the ready and tried to burn the place down!\" Harriet made hand actions to match her words \"Lighter?\" Jane was struck by a sudden thought \"Not now, Jane. Have respect for court protocol\" \"What lighter, Harriet?\" Charlotte pressed \"Jesus, Charlotte how daft can you possibly be? That ridiculous 'I heart LA' lighter of hers. She left it behind for God's sake\" Harriet condescended. Jane, Charlotte and Mrs Kingsley all had the look of discovery dawn upon their faces as they realised Harriet's slip up. Tegan and Poppy also exchanged confused glances. \"Except, how do you know that, Harriet? No ones mentioned a lighter before\" Jane quizzed and Harriet turned to her. \"What? Yes they have. Objection\" Harriet said in a much smaller voice and sat. \"Actually Harriet, they haven't\" Jane pressured \"I have to second Jane's question, Harriet. How did you know about that lighter?\" Mrs Kingsley added, her tone now knowing as if she was daring Harriet to lie to her face. \"Well I, I was ju-\" Harriet began \"Only the girls in my dorm know about my lighter and Freddie because Tee told him about it. He found the lighter before anyone saw it. How could you possibly know, unless … unless you were there?\" Poppy became suspicious. \"Well this is absurd\" Harriet said after a moment. \"I refuse to sit here and listen to these -\" Harriet began but Poppy spoke over her: \"I had put it out. And I heard footsteps - it must've been you! Oh my God! You restarted the fire, didn't you?\" \"Harriet is this true?\" Mrs Kingsley asked \"Of course not\" Harriet said appearing overly innocent with wide eyes and extensive shakes of her head. \"It all makes sense now. I knew it! I th-think I'm innocent\" Poppy stammered \"We think so too\" Jane and Charlotte smiled \"YOU'RE NOT!\" Harriet erupted, springing from her seat - again. Poppy and Tegan both got to their feet as well as Harriet approached them. \"You awful bitch! You two have turned this school upside down! You've both ruined everything!\" The hall broke out in gasps and not-so-subtle whisperings. Harriet turned her focus back to Poppy as she said: \"You started it! I only finished what you STARTED!\" \"Harriet! My office. Now!\" Mrs Kingsley stood, leaning over the desk as the head girl whipped round to face her, panting. Harriet slowly walked out the hall as Poppy suddenly found herself being leaped on by Tegan, who giggled happily. Then Kate, Josie, Drippy and Kiki ran up and embraced the two, also laughing and smiling in sheer joy. Soon enough the entirety of Poppy's year, who were all congregated on floor level ran forward and embraced the embracers who were then themselves embraced. The other years looked down in delight from the balcony above. As Tegan hugged Poppy she suddenly remembered her mum. \"Oh crap! Poppy, I'll be back in a minute I have to phone my mum!\" Tegan said breaking away from her. \"Ok, hurry back though!\" Poppy smiled \"Will do\" Tegan replicated her beaming grin and with great difficulty left the crowd. After weaving, ducking and in a few instances pushing. Tegan got herself out the mass of hug. Dialling her mum's number and pressing the phone to left ear she walked out the hall and down the corridors to a more quiet spot. \"Come on … Pick up, come on\" she murmured quietly as she walked down the halls and corridors, listening to the phone ring. A sudden hand caught her right hand and she was pulled back into the more shaded area of the underside of the staircase in main reception. Looking round she came to face Freddie, who looked more than a little relieved as he wrapped both his arms around her waist as she wrapped hers around his neck, her phone still ringing her mum, in her left hand. He lifted her off the ground, spinning them round a few times, in the definition of elation. Tegan giggled at his actions before he set her down. She went to say something but Freddie's mouth quickly landed on hers. Unlike the other kisses they'd shared, this was risky. Not only because anyone could catch them but because out of relief and guilt the two were a lot more daring - being more tactile and not letting common sense prevail. Their arms stayed locked in place as their' heads tilted in attempt to gain more access and their' tongues began play. \"…hello? Hello? Tee, you there? Tegan?\" The buzzy voice of Tegan's mum rang out from her phone. Reluctantly Tegan broke their kiss, Freddie trying to recapture her lips by ducking forward several times and trying to get to her lips as she laughed, moving her head out the way as she brought her phone to her ear \"Hello, mum. Your not going to believe it - it was Harriet that set the fire. Poppy did put it out she wasn't lyi - yes mum, Harriet the 'Bitch' … yeah, so I'm staying and so's Poppy and … what? No I'm fine … earlier? What do you mean earl - oh, that. Never mind I was just a little, er out of breath? With happiness?\" Tegan ended up lying but it was pretty obvious and Freddie chuckled having stopped trying to kiss her and just stood holding her as she spoke to her mum. \"Well now you'll get to stay with that boy you like\" He heard, Tegan's mum say through the phone. Tegan blushed as Freddie chortled \"Mum! There were other reasons I wanted to stay! I, I … you know what I'll phone you back when you aren't giggling like a school girl. Bye, love you\" Tegan hung up and groaned, dropping her head to his shoulder as he tightened his grip on her. Kissing her head, Freddie laughed: \"You've spoke to your mum about me?\" \"Well, yeah. She's my mum and we're close\" Tegan shrugged before asking: \"Are you still ok with us, you know … being together even though our 'fraternising' is forbidden?\" \"Is that a trick question?\" Freddie asked, a smile on his face as he leaned it, kissing her again. She reciprocated eagerly until Josie's voice sounded, tearing them apart. \"Hey, Te - oh, shit! Tee, I'm so sorry! Poppy wants you! I'll just go!\" Josie spun around covering her eyes before taking off in the direction of the hall. \"I'd better be going\" Tegan said, detangling herself from his hold \"Yeah\" Freddie sighed in defeat as she moved out from under the staircase. \"Hey, don't look so glum. I'll speak to you later\" She smiled \"You'd best otherwise I'll be back in your dorm again\" he teased \"So you did see my underwear?! You -\" \"Ah, ah, ah. No swearing in school\" \"I'm sorry sir … oh it's just you\" she rolled her eyes and quoting one of the first conversations they had before going to leave \"Just me?\" He played along \"Yeah, just you … Bye\" she smiled \"Bye\" he mirrored her expression and she took off towards the hall. -line break- \"Poppy!\" Tegan cried running up to her brunette friend and hugging her again. The crowd had now dispersed and it was just Poppy, Kate, Kiki, Josie, Drippy and now Tegan in the room. \"TEE! We did it! We proved our innocence!\" Poppy shrieked and the two while hugging began to jump around \"I KNOW!\" Tegan replied as the two pulled apart. \"You know, I think this has been the quickest school year - ever.\" Drippy summed up randomly from her spot perched on the desk Mrs Kingsley was sat at during the trial. \"I know, I was thinking the exact same!\" Josie exclaimed from her spot lounged out across four chairs, her feet in Kiki's lap on the front row \"What? Guys, what are you talking about?\" Poppy asked \"Pops, you are aware that there like 2 maybe 3 weeks until we break up for Summer\" Tegan asked \"2 weeks, 4 days. Actually\" Kiki spoke up. \"But, but the semester - my dad said he'd collect me at the end of the semester and if schools nearly out it means I've been here like 8 months!\" Poppy wailed. Josie, Kate, Tegan and Drippy turned to Kiki for the answer as to explain Poppy's sudden annoyance \"A semester is normally, 15 - 18 weeks. So around 6 months\" Kiki shrugged and the others 'oh'd ' \"Well a lots happened\" Kate reasoned from where she sat on the chair closest to the desk and Drippy. \"Yeah, from September till Christmas we all hated you, no offence\" Josie admitted \"Then from Christmas till, like, April was Operation Freedom plus other general mutiny because the Saturday before Easter was the social\" Kiki added \"Did you seriously not notice we were gone for two weeks over Christmas?\" Drippy was now eating a Wagon Wheel \"Well yeah, I noticed but I didn't really register it, you know?\" Poppy admitted \"Jesus, Poppy\" Tegan laughed and so did the others \"And then from Easter half term till now been LaCrosse, Freddie and Tegan or as I now like to call you, Teddie. The the whole email thing and this and …\" Drippy trailed off and it suddenly became a little awkward \"Well it's all ended well so let's not dwell on it, ey?\" Tegan smiled trying to shrug it off and lighten the mood. The others exchanged glances before busting out laughing. \"What?\" Tegan asked \"You!\" Josie giggled \"Rainbows and Unicorns\" Kiki added and Tegan caught on before laughing herself. \"Is my optimism a problem?\" Tegan false stropped in indignation \"No! No! It's why we love you baby Tee!\" Poppy reassured still, laughing. \"Tegan Wills\" Matron's voice cut through the air. The 6 turned to see the small but fierce woman stood in the doorway. \"Yes, Matron?\" Tegan stepped towards her as the others collected themselves and went to gather behind her but a distance back. \"Mrs Kingsley would like to see you in her office. Immediately\" \"Ok\" Tegan sounded as unsure as she felt but followed Matron out the room no less. They walked in silence to the headmistress' office in silence all that could be heard was Matron's harsh footsteps and the tiny pitter-patter of Tegan's feet. Once they reached the door, Matron wrapped her clenched fist on the door \"Who is it?\" Mrs Kingsley called from inside \"Matron, Mrs Kingsley. I've brought the girl, like you asked\" Matron informed \"Ok, send her in\" at Mrs Kingsley orders, Matron stepped aside, opening the door and all but hauled her in the room. After a rough push into the room, Tegan flinched when the door slammed behind her. Glancing around the room, she noticed Freddie was sat reading on the window seat, not noticing her present. Freddie was vaguely aware of a girl entering the office. He heard Matron introduce her and his mother, who was sat at her desk, call her in. However once the door viciously shut the draft caught the person's scent. Freddie began to sniff lightly, it was the familiar sweet smell of vanilla, brown sugar and a undefinable sweet smell. Suddenly it hit him, it was … \"Ah, Miss Wills. Please sit\" Freddie looked up from his book and craned his neck to look at Tegan who smiled a coy and small smile so as not to be seen. Freddie grinned conspicuously as he watched her sit in one of the chairs opposite his mother. \"Will you excuse me a moment, I have to go and get something.\" Mrs Kingsley dismissed herself before exiting her office through the door Tegan had just entered through. \"Tike\" Freddie acknowledged her, folding the page of the book he was reading as he got of the window seat and went over to her. He stood behind her and leant over, his head next to hers - the book still in one of his hands as it leant on the armrest of the chair and the other hand on her shoulder. \"Mr Kingsley, being a bit riské are we?\" Tegan teased, nudging her head towards his \"Well my mum's not here, so we might as well utilise the time\" Freddie went to capture her lips but she merely laughed, raising her hand and gently pushing his face away. \"Nu-huh. Not happening\" she giggled \"What, why?\" He pouted starting to kiss her neck and face as she wriggled desperately trying to to cave in to his kisses. \"Your mum, who has forbidden you fraternising with girls has just left to get something, files or whatever and will be back any moment and there's no way in this life or fullers that I'm letting your mum find out about us by her finding us snogging in her office. When she finds out we're going to tell her not let her discover by rumours and speculation\" Tegan explained and Freddie sighed in agreement. The sudden voice of Mrs Kingsley sounded: \"I'm glad to here it\" the headmistress commended. Freddie jump away from Tegan, while she slid to the far side of the seat. The moved with such sped and force it was like the other person's presence suddenly burned him. \"Mum\" Freddie rubbed the back of his neck, nervously as he looked at his feet \"Mrs Kingsley\" Tegan mumbled suddenly becoming occupied by her knees that were bouncing out of anxiousness \"I'm not going to beat around the bush with this. I know of your' … your' liking for and each other and that is why I called Tegan here\" Mrs Kingsley moved and sat at her desk. \"I've had an inclination that something may be happening happening for a while. It's more than a little obvious. But if I had to choose a wife for Freddie, Tegan, you'd be my first and only choice. That is why I'm offering you a proposition. If you both promise the keep up your school standards and other commitments then I'm happy to allow you see each other. I see what you share is not only a physical admiration but a mental liking too, unlike Miss Furcroft from when you were 11, Freddie - that was more a hormone fuelled lustrous infatuation\" Mrs Kingsley explained \"Mum\" Freddie groaned \"What it's true. However it's obvious to anyone with half a brain that your relationship isn't merely sexual attraction but also two people of similar and yet vastly differing mind sets who together are very, very good\" \"Erm thank you?\" Tegan didn't really know how to respond \"Sexual? Mum we've been on one date!\" Freddie groaned \"It takes less than one date, it can take less than one minute. Trust me I should know …\" Mrs Kingsley teased \"Oh! No! No! No! Too much information! Stop right there!\" Freddie covered his ears and Tegan giggled along with Mrs Kingsley. \"What I'm trying to say is … I accept and I approve\" Mrs Kingsley beamed. Freddie and Tegan also broke in to ecstatic smiles, Freddie moving to stand behind her again as his hands cradled her head before placing an over dramatic kiss to the top of it. \"Ah, ah, ah. None of that in my presence please. Hand holding is the limit. What you do in your own, private time, is your business. Just remember what I said though less than 1 minute. I don't want to be a grandmother yet\" Mrs Kingsley semi-joked as the two blushed.[Chapter 9] The LaCrosse team quickly dispersed from the their little huddle. Running on to the pitch in their sky blue and red/purple kit, Poppy started barking orders: \"Ok, suckers! Showtime! Let's open a can of whoop ass\" she bellowed and Josie found her way to the referee who was stood with a girl from the other team. The spectators of the match which were mainly pupils and the teaching body but parents had come down to watch the game as it was the last day and the girls could start leaving for summer after the match. Most of the girls were chanting 'Abbey Mount' repetitively and clapped while the girls played. \"Come on guys, we can bring it back. Let's go\" Poppy encouraged as the other team scored. Everyone was so caught up in the game that neither Poppy nor Mrs Kingsley noticed Poppy's father arrive. \"Mrs Kingsley?\" He spoke up and the headmistress turned to him. She was currently sat with Tegan's mother and an older member of staff. \"Oh, Mr Moore. You made it … oh please come and take a seat\" Mrs Kingsley smiled shaking his hand. Mr Moore sat before glancing over at Tegan's mother. \"Gerry Moore\" he offered his hand \"Jessica Wills\" Tegan's mum shook his hand. \"So did I miss much?\" Mr Moore asked \"No not at all\" Mrs Kingsley assured \"Where's Poppy?\" \"She's right there\" Mrs Kingsley pointed to where Tegan and Poppy were flanking each side of a player from the rival team. Tegan was the side closest to them and therefore Mr Moore made the classic mistake of assuming she was Poppy. \"She's grown\" he mused \"No not her …\" Mrs Kingsley began just as Tegan ran further up field to Kiki allowing Poppy to be clearly visible \"… her\" she corrected and Mr Moore looked awe struck. She looked so much like her mother. Standing to get a closer look, he watched as she skilfully intercepted the ball and continued possession of it before passing. \"She's the spitting image of her mother, isn't she?\" Mrs Kingsley appeared beside him \"She most certainly is\" he agreed, still stood, staring in shock. \"Am I right in assuming that both Tegan and Poppy will be joining us for the next academic year?\" Mrs Kingsley enquired \"If she wishes to stay\" Mr Moore nodded \"I'm sure the task now would be getting Tegan to leave. She's found a boy! I mean God knows where, as this is a girls school but no, a boy, nonetheless\" Ms Wills laughed and Mrs Kingsley smiled before uttering a slightly embarrassed: \"Actually this boy she's 'found' is my son\" \"Son? Really? … wow\" Ms Wills breathed out, now to feeling a little humiliated \"Well I'm sure he's an upstanding young gent, judging by his mother so no fear\" Mr Moore tried to diffuse the awkwardness Meanwhile on the pitch, the game was getting more intense. Abbey Mount we're loosing so upped their game. In response the other team starting playing a little rough. \"COME ON! ANNABELLE!\" Poppy screeched as said team mate passed the ball, which was caught by Tegan who ran like the wind towards the net once she got it. That was until one of the other team decided to play a little nasty, tripping Tegan up and running of with the ball. \"Come on, Abbey Mount! Let's go!\" Poppy called and the referee's whistle blew, signalling a break. By the time Tegan got there, Ms Rees-Withers was already giving her inspirational prep talk. \"Tee, you ok?\" Kiki asked and the blonde nodded despite it being a little bit of a lie. The trip had not only been ignored by the referee but also left Tegan with a splitting head ache, fuzzing vision and a jaw that now cracked. \"Uh-huh\" she nodded closing her eyes and letting her heavy head fall back. Trying to stem the pounding in her head. \"Can I have some water please\" she croaked out after a moment and Ms Rees-Withers obliged while carrying out a fleeting examination her jaw. \"… look at them. They have no possession …\" she heard the coach of the other team gloat. Manoeuvring round to the far side of the bench where Poppy was sat, Tegan said: \"They're laughing at us\" \"I know, but what can we do?\" \"We can do nothing. You, however, can\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You know full well what I mean. You are Poppy Moore. My out are the girl who single handily got this team back on form. If anyone can do this you can\" Tegan smiled, her jaw was already starting to turn a hideous blue green colour. \"All right ladies! There is only one thing for it! Let's go!\" Poppy announced, getting off the bench and the rest of the team followed her lead as the followed her. \"Who are we?\" Poppy asked \"ABBEY MOUNT\" came the unified shout of the team \"Who are we?\" Poppy asked again \"ABBEY MOUNT\" they shouted louder \"What are we?\" Poppy changed the question \"Open leading single sex school admitting borders at age 11\" Drippy began to holler a quote from the school brochure but it turned into a mere whisper when no one shouted with her. A few giggled erupted at her comment but they weren't meant to be nasty. \"The school prospectus would agree with you but right now you're-\" Tegan tried to console before she was cut off \"WRONG! We're winners!\" Poppy declared as they all fell into 2 semi-straight, single file line (one in front of the other). Poppy hit the play button on the CD player and the music they practiced their motivational hacker to came on. Soon enough they began to fall into the routine they'd practiced and full on went for it, not bothered by what anyone thought as they boosted their self belief and aggression. Their performance definitely caused quite a stir, parents, teachers and pupils from both schools - turning to watch. The opposition looked the perfect blend of surprised, amused & mocking and petrified. The break was whistled over and the game began again, only this time Abbey Mount were brutal. They took no prisoners as the pushed and shoved to get the ball. Toing and throwing will the opposite team to get one over. They cut down their players and ran rings round them. They had near enough 100% possession and kept a tightly woven string of passes up as they moved. Soon enough they were back on track. They equalised and Poppy gave the simple command of: \"This is our last chance! Let's make it count!\" And the mad dash to score the winning point began. Abbey Mount as a team pushed themselves past their limits. They ran faster than they'd ever ran. They passed longer distances than they'd ever passed. They were ruthless in cutting down opposing forces, something they were only giving 50% or less to before. Their all-you've-got-and-more strategy was definitely working as they kept the ball in their possession and at their scoring end of the pitch as the waited for the perfect moment to strike and score. \"KIKI!\" Poppy exclaimed, passing the ball \"DRIPPY!\" Kiki hollered once she'd caught it, passing it to the frizzy blonde \"Why are you passing it to me?! Oh my god! Ok … TEE!\" Drippy yelled and passed the ball. Tegan caught it and became aware she was surrounded by the opposite team \"Oh my god! Guys, where are you? Help! What do I do?! Jane! Jane! … DRIPPY BACK TO YOU!\" Tegan passed the ball back. Drippy barely caught it before she slipped, falling flat on the floor (much like Tegan earlier), Drippy let out a shrill scream and the audience gasped as the ball flew through the air before landing and rolling straight into … THE NET! The ball miraculously dodged the other team's scooping and swatting bats and ended up in the net. Abbey Mount had won. 3-2. The girls of Abbey Mount, both the team and the girls started screaming in elation as the teachers and parents cheered and whooped. The team embraced in one huge giddy group hug. Soon enough the Abbey Mount pupils has joined them on the pitch for the celebration while the clapping and yelling continued. \"Do you think we should?\" Mr Moore asked Tegan's mum as they watched their once identical daughters hug in the mass crowd of jumping, squealing and hugging girls. \"Yeah\" Ms Wills agreed and the began to wade through the crowd of of ecstatic girls. Shifting through they finally reached a suitable hearing distance as they continued to trek. \"TEE!\" Ms Wills yelled. Tegan pulled away from Kate's hug to see her mum trying to get through the heaves of girls. \"MUM!\" She cried running up to her, joyous tears filling her eyes. \"POPPY!\" She recognised the voice of Poppy's dad but right now all that mattered to Tegan was her mum. They finally met in a crushing embrace, both of them leaking happy tears of relief and joy. \"I can't believe your here!\" Tegan exclaimed pulling away \"Neither can I!\" her mum caught her cheeks and started kissing all over her face. Squirming but giggling, Tegan groaned. \"No, mum. Stop\" \"Oh I'm sorry I forgot, you only want lover boy to do that now, correct?\" Her mum teased \"Mum! Stop\" Tegan groaned \"What talking about lover boy? I can't, you see part of the reason why I'm here is to discuss when you're going to be seeing each other over the holidays\" \"Discuss? Discuss with who?\" \"His mother of course!\" \"Wait, you know Freddie is Mrs Kingsley's son?\" \"Freddie, ey? I'm expecting a cute boy with a name like that\" \"Mum!\" \"I'm serious! Now come on I want all the goss\" Tegan's mum pulled her from the crowd. A thought struck Tegan as she stopped walking, her hand pulling her mum to a stop. \"Mum?\" She asked sounding like a kicked puppy \"Tegan, darling. What is it? What's wrong?\" Her mum turned to her holding her face, using her thumb to caress her daughter's cheeks \"You don't … hate me, do you? For everything I did … I … I, I didn't mean to … I -\" Tegan stuttered, her eyes forlorn and downcast \"Hate you?! Darling no! I could never hate you!\" She pulled her into a hug \"I told you everything would be alright\" a new voice piped up. Pulling apart, Tegan came to realise Freddie's presence next to them. \"Freddie?\" Tegan questioned even though she knew who it was, she wasn't expecting to see him \"Tike\" he smirked \"Oh, so this is Freddie! Well done! I obviously did something right when I raised you\" her mum teased, Tegan blushed and Freddie chuckled \"And you must be Tegan's mum. Pleasure to meet you Ms Wills\" he shook her hand \"Jess' fine, my love. Anyway I've got something to do. I'll leave you two to it\" and with that she drifted away in to the crowds. \"Well that was embarrassing\" Tegan muttered \"That was cute\" Freddie counted, his arms finding her waist and he drew her close to him. Tegan sat her hands on his chest as she looked up at him. \"When did you get here?\" She asked, absentmindedly pinching the cotton of his shirt \"About 5 minutes ago. Schools out today for us\" \"We finish tomorrow … you know my mum and your mum are holding talks as to when we visit each other during the holiday?\" \"I was vaguely aware\" \"And you didn't tell me?\" Tegan pouted in false dramatic shock and betrayal \"I'm sorry it's just I thought with our parents pre-occupying each other we could slip away, maybe back to your dorm and while we pack we can talk and … other things\" he admitted shamelessly \"Other things, ey? Like what?\" She teased \"Kissing and Cuddling\" he started placing mock sultry kisses on her neck. Tegan wriggled in his arms, trying to get away but he held her tight \"I'm not letting go until you agree\" he informed her \"Never … N-nev … stop … Fre-people are … FINE! I give in. I give in. I give in\" Tegan managed to get out of his grasp after her acceptance \"Yay!\" Freddie said in a imitation of a girly voice, grabbing her hand and skipping off, leaving her to follow behind laughing her head off. -line break- Once Tegan's backs were all packed up Freddie helped her carry them down and to Tegan's mum's car where both Jessica and Mrs Kingsley were waiting. \"Ah, there you are\" Jessica began, taking a suitcase off Freddie and a hold all from Tegan before putting them in the boot while Mrs Kingsley spoke: \"Now I've been talking to your Mum, Tegan and Mr Moore too and we've come to an agreement. During the 8 weeks off, Tegan can come to us for two weeks Freddie and you can go to hers for a fortnight. Poppy would also like you both - Freddie as Tegan's esteemed guest of honour - to go to her house for a two weeks as well.\" \"We're not sure when all this is happening yet we're going to sort that out tonight over email\" Ms Wills smiled, shoving Tegan's last suitcase in to the boot of her car. \"Well we're ready to go, Tee. Say your goodbyes - we'll be over there\" Ms Wills announced before walking a slight distance away from Mrs Kingsley. \"My dad's going to be here in 5 minutes\" Freddie sighed \"So we best make it quick then\" Tegan replied in a tone of equal sadness \"I suppose. I love you Tike\" He chuckled, kissing her forehead before grabbing her hands. He held her eyes in an enchanting gaze as he spoke: \"So you'll be okay without me? Sure you'll survive?\" He joked \"Oh survive yes, but live? Never!\" She proclaimed dramatically evoking laughter from the two of them. Both were so happy, to any on lookers they would have looked completely content but they knew internally they were crumbling. \"I hope you have a good summer, enjoy yourself … but to much, at least not without me\" she smiled. \"I'll have my brother back with me 24/7 the old squad back together. We'll get up to all sorts of crap\" he let out a breathy laugh, squeezing her hands. \"Freddie, darling. Your father's here\" Mrs Kingsley called out, interrupting them. Tegan's smile faltered but she quickly quirked the corners of her mouth back slightly in a watery smile. Freddie's however, totally disappeared. His once sad smile was replaced by a madero frown. \"I'm going to miss you\" She took in a deep breath to compose herself as her voice began to quiver. \"I miss you already.\" He tried to lighten the mood. \"I love you so much Freddie but you've got to go. Don't want to keep your dad waiting and I'll call you later anyway, I promise\" she reassured, letting go of his hands. Freddie backed up a few steps before turning and walking towards his mother who was already setting her belongings in to the back of Freddie's dad's car. Freddie's car was secured on a trailer behind the larger more modern vehicle drove by Mr Kingsley. Tegan to get in her car when she heard: \"Tike! Wait!\" She stepped back out of the open door and moved to the side of it, Freddie running back towards her. \"There's something that I forgot\" he explained. \"Please don't say you've accidentally packed one of your hoodies in my suitcase - I really don't want to dig through all to get it\" she groaned \"No not that\" he smiled \"What then?\" Tegan enquired but her sole response was Freddie grabbing her waist, pulling her flush to him. He pinched her chin lightly getting her to look up at him before placing his lips on her's. She wrapped her arms around his neck, kissing him back. \"I love you Wills, Tegan Wills\" He said looking into her eyes. \"I love you too but get back in your car! Your mother's glaring and ranting and your dad appears to be saying something along the lines of 'boys will be boys' \" Tegan peered over his shoulder looking at his parents through the driver's side front window. No surprise his parents were already watching them and that's why the blonde could so easily read Mr Kingsley's lips. Freddie chuckled, pulling away. \"Bye Tike\" he said once more \"Bye\" she smiled and got into her own car.[Chapter 10] Half way through their 2 month brake, Tegan, Freddie, Drippy, Kate, Josie and Kiki found themselves at Poppy's Malibu mansion. They were all lounging outside. The girls floating on pinky/purple inflatables. Drippy was at the far end, then Kiki, Poppy, Tegan, Josie and Kate. Laying on a towel on the poolside directly next to Tegan was Freddie. The girls all soaked up the sun in their pretty bathing suits and bikinis. Tegan's two piece swim wear was a white bikini with triangle cups and black narrow ties. It also had black mesh on sides of the bottoms and on the top of the triangle breast cups. The cups also has a piece of black fabric (the same kind that was used for the ties) running down the centre of the cup from the ending of the mesh to thick black tie at the bottom of the bikini top. All her hair was piled on top of her head in a messy bun. Freddie however being a boy only had some muted teal swim shorts on, leaving his muscular chest on full display- something Drippy nearly dropped dead at while Kate talked about what his da girls would do if they were there While all of them were sunbathing, some decided to occupy their time differently. Kate was reading a magazine, Kiki and Josie had drifted off into a land of semi sleep, where their eyes were closed and they'd were drowsy but still conscious enough to know what was going on. Drippy and Poppy were chatting absentmindedly and Tegan hand on arm raised and adjoining hand threaded into Freddie's hair. She stroked and caresses the blonde mop on his head as he flicked through a car magazine of some sort. \" … blood sula!\" Drippy exclaimed dropping back onto the lilo. Suddenly a phone began to ring. All their phones were safely out of splash distance near Freddie's side. None of the girls new whether her heard the phone and just ignored it or was in his own little dream state. \"Mr Kingsley can you get my phone please\" Poppy asked, holding out a hand expecting said item to drop into it at any minute \"Freddie?\" Poppy questioned when her phone wasn't passed to her. Freddie was still gazing blankly at the magazine as Tegan massaged his head \"Christ Tegan! Are you sure your just massaging his head and that you haven't triggered an aneurysm?\" Drippy raised her eyebrows and the others, including Kiki and Drippy who'd returned to majority consciousness, laughed. \"Baby Tee, get lover boy to get my phone\" Poppy pouted at the blonde next to her. \"Freddie? … Freddie? … \" Tegan also got no response so stopped her motions with her hand and withdrew it from his hair, that woke him up. \"Hey! Why'd you stop?\" He complained, reaching to grab her wrist \"Ah ah ah! Poppy's phone's ringing pass it her and then I promise I'll continue\" Tegan reasoned \"Fine\" he huffed, getting Poppy's phone as Tegan weaved her hand back in to his hair. \"Who's Ruby?\" He asked passing Poppy her phone. \"Huh, nobody …\" Poppy declined Ruby's incoming call and passed it back to him. \"…just some horrideous cow I use to know\" she shrugged and the other 5 fell about laughing.

Chapter 1: Poppy ran back to her room in a state of panic as she held the secrets about the family but was reassured slightly by the thought that she had stopped the fire. Walking back into her dorm she saw that all her friends were still in their beds but even if they were awake she knew that they would have snubbed her anyway. Hours later Poppy was shaken awake by Kate shouting in her ear. \"Poppy! Poppy! Wake up we have to get out the buildings on fire quick get up!\" dread went straight to Poppy's heart as she heard Kate say them words. She kept her eyes closed for one moment hoping that it wasn't true and that she was just having a horrible nightmare,, but she could also feel the heat of the fire on her face and opening her eyes she saw that the room was glowing red . \"The ceilings on fire\" shouted Drippy the fear clearly in her voice. Looking up Poppy saw flames licking the ceiling as they burned down from the roof. Jumping out of bed she went to follow all of her friends out of the dorm and to safety but it was too late. Drippy followed Kate out of the door then looked back to try hurry Poppy up but to her horror there was a great creaking sound from above and the ceiling in their dorm fell in on its self and onto Poppy \"POPPY\" she screamed at the top of her voice making her way back into the debris filled room but matron walked by at that very point grabbed her arm and proceeded to drag her along the corridor and down the stairs saying at the same time. \"ARE YOU MAD CHILD WE HAVE TO GET OUT!\" and ignoring the frantic spluttering of Drippy crying \"b...b...but P...P...Poppy's still in their\" Freddie watched as Drippy was dragged out of the burning building by matron and looking at her more closely he saw that she was in a state of distress but dismissed it completely because they were all distressed right now. Freddie watched as his mum read out the names of all the girls and was relived that all answered thus far on his mothers lift. So he was starting to relax thinking they had all got out safely when he heard something that chilled him to the bone. Kate took hold of Drippys shoulders looking her in the face and said to her calmly and slowly. \"Drippy what's wrong what happened why are you crying\" Drippy sniffed and hundreds of more tears spilled down her face but she managed to choke out. \"P..P...Poppy was in the dorm the ceiling collapsed she's trapped\" Freddie stood frozen to the spot then to reconfirm his fears he heard his mum shout out Poppy's name and no answer came and knowing that Drippy would not lie about something like this he ran full pelt back into the burning building shouting. \"POPPY!\"[Chapter 2] Really really hope you liked the first chapter, but again please, please, please, please, please review. Chapter 2: Poppy woke minutes later to noise all around her she was lying on the ground and moving her head slightly she saw the door to her dorm was open. She tried to move but there was a sharp pain in her legs and turning her body slightly still wincing with pain and saw that a large part of the ceiling had landed on her legs trapping her in the process. Tears swelled up in her eyes as the pain hit her again. Turning back to face the ground she cried into her hands. Freddie ran into the school frantically looking around for a place that will lead him to the dormitories but there was rubble everywhere blocking his path, he knew that she had broken his heart but he still loved her and couldn't bear it if something happened to her. Poppy lay there for a few minutes as the pain in her legs intensified even more making her cry out until it got too much and she passed out again. Freddie had found a way to the dorm stairs and was hurriedly climbing them when he heard something that stopped him in his tracks as a cry of obvious pain came from above. Hurrying even more he made his way into the dorm corridor shouting all the way. \"POPPY, POPPY WHERE ARE YOU!\" but no answer came which made his heart ache with worry. Running along the corridor to the end where Poppy's room was he had to avoid so much rubble on the way. When he got to the door he thanked God that it wasn't blocked looking inside he saw something horrific that made his heart stop for a moment and he forgot to breath , Poppy was lying on the floor clearly unconscious with her legs trapped under a bit of ceiling. Coming back to his senses he hurried to her side kneeling down in the process tears threatened to spill from his eyes but he held them back. He got all his strength up and heaved the bit of ceiling off her legs. Then turning her over he looked into her face and even though she was unconscious Freddie could still see the anguished look of pain in her face. Putting one hand under her knees and one under her back he lifted her bridal style and proceeded his way down the corridor hoping that the building would stay standing until they got out.[Chapter 3] Sorry i haven't updates in a while been really busy revising for tests. Hope you like this new chapter please review when you have finished. Chapter 3: Josie could not take her eyes of the front entrance of the school praying that both Poppy and Freddie will come out unscathed, but from what drippy had told them about the roof collapsing there was not much hope. They could all see that Mrs Kinsley was beside herself with worry but was holding it in as she tried to calm down the students. Josie had to start scrunching her eyes up because the smoke billowing from the building was getting thicker and it was harder to see through it she was just about to give up trying to look for her two friends when she saw movement in the door. Hoping that it was Freddie and Poppy trying to get out and not something that had collapsed against the door on the inside she ran towards it and ignoring the scolding heat on the metal door knob she pulled it with all her strength. Freddie's eyes swelled with tears because he thought he was never going to get the door open and them both to safety when all of a sudden it flew open and bewildered he staggered out holding the unconscious form of Poppy in his arms, and then he heard a gasp beside him and turned his head slightly to see Josie with her hands over her mouth and then he knew that it had been her that had opened the door for them. Josie had never seen anything as horrifying as she saw the unconscious form of Poppy held protectively by Freddie. She knew that Poppy had been mean to them but no one deserved this she saw the pain in her face and looking down saw blood on her legs where the ceiling had cut it when it fell. \"We have to get out of here\" Freddie shouted to Josie over the roar of the fire. Coming back to her senses she nodded and led Freddie back through the smoke towards the rest of the school. Poppy felt the pain in her legs again and at first thought she still must be in the dormitory until she felt a cold breeze on her face and struggling to open her eyes she saw she was being carried by someone. Turning her head slightly she looked into the face of her saviour and smiled because Freddies face was above hers looking more aged from the torture he just had to go through but still handsome. She tried to lift her arm but found that they were a ton weight and she simply didn't have the strength. \"Freddie\" Poppy said in a croaky voice trying to get his attention. As soon as she said that he looked down and seeing that she was awake the tears that had threatened to come for so long started pouring down his face as he whispered. \"Poppy\"[Chapter 4] Only two tests left so i should start updating faster soon but until then i will not be able to write as much as i want to sorry. Please review. Chapter 4: Freddie saw her eyes open and was so happy that she was awake that he started crying and he kept crying as he gave her over to the paramedics. Mrs Kinsley hugged Freddie tightly when she saw he was out of the building and when she saw Poppy she covered her mouth in horror and started crying as well. Drippy watched this reunion of mother and son and she cried as well when she saw Poppy her legs were covered in blood and burns. \"Oh Poppy\" Drippy said as she shoved through the crowd of students around her and reached her side. Poppy looked up at Drippy and smiled then said trying to be jokey even though she was in so much pain. \"Well i always said the school would crush me but i always thought it would be my spirit\" Drippy laughed slightly and so did Poppy until she coughed because of the smoke in her lungs which meant that the paramedics wheeled her away quickly and left Drippy standing there staring after her. Freddie seeing poppy being put into the back of the ambulance hurried in and climbed in next to her ignoring the protests of the paramedics and saying over and over again. \"I'm not leaving her\" which made them give up and close the door on both of them as the driver pulled away. Kate stood with the rest of her friends all with tears in their eyes as they watched the ambulance drive off with Poppy and Freddie in the back. Harriet watched clenching her teeth as Freddie got into the back of the ambulance with Poppy and insisted on going with her. \"She can't be that hurt she was only in there for 5 minutes\" Harriet said evilly which drew the attention of Josie who turned round and shouted at Harriet. \"YOU BITCH HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT POPPIES LEGS ARE COMPLEATLY CRUSHED YOU SELFISH SNOP\" Harriet stepped back slightly at Josie's outburst but came to her senses and was about to reply when matron stepped in and shouted at all of them screeching. \"QUIET YOU SHOULD ALL BE THANKFUL TO GOD THAT YOU GOT OUT SO STOP BICKERING!\" with that matron marched off to talk with Mrs Kinsley leaving the girls in shock and feeling very sheepish. Freddie held Poppy's hand all the way to the hospital and was only detached from her when they got to the hospital and she was wheeled into the emergency room and he was forced to fall back as the doctors set to work trying to ease her pain.[Chapter 5] I'm am so, so, so, so, so sorry i haven't updated in ages but I've had a lot to do with tests and freaking out about the tests so please forgive me. Chapter 5: Not until the sun rose did the horrific damage on the school that the fire had done came into full focus to put it simply half the school was gone. Most of the students had been picked up by parents and taken home only a few remained and these were all the friends of Poppy Moore who refused point blank to leave and were now staying in a hotel close to the hospital. Freddie had stayed in the hospital waiting anxiously for a response from Poppy. It had been 3 days since the fire and Poppy had been unconscious all that time. The doctors had managed to fix her legs the best they could but didn't know for sure until she woke up and as the days stretched on it seemed less and less likely that Poppy would. \"Hi\" Kate said as she walked into the room where Poppy was Freddie briefly looked up at her then fixed his eyes once again on the girl he loved but said in a voice obviously full of grief. \"Hi\" Kate sighed and sat on one of the chairs by the bed looking at Freddie she shook her head and said. \"You need to eat\" Freddie just ignored her so she continued. \"Freddie please when Poppy wakes up it would be better if she doesn't have to worry about your well being not only her own\" \"I'm not leaving her\" Freddie growled at her Kate sighed then getting up grabbed him under the arm and heaved him up and out the door before he could argue. Once out the room Freddie realised Kate had a point and begrudgingly made his way to the small cafe in the middle of the hospital. Kate sat back down by the bed and smiling slightly said. \"Oh Poppy boys what are they like and you've made this one love sick\" no response came the silence that followed was long and Kate couldn't bare it tears started to slid down her face. Poppy didn't know where she was no sounds could be heard around her not even the snores of Drippy which were usually very prominent starting to panic she tried to move her legs so they pushed back the covers but they wouldn't move. Giving up on her legs Poppy opened her eyes expecting the darkness of the dormitory but instead a blinding light just above her head. Kate couldn't believe her eyes as Poppy opened hers sitting stock still she whispered. \"Poppy\" hearing some sound at last she turned her head and saw Kate sitting in a chair next to her. \"Where am I?\" she asked her voice coming out croaky. \"You're in the hospital Poppy\" Kate replied smiling at her friend trying to comfort her but scared at Poppy's condition. \"Where's Fre...\" but she couldn't finish before she collapsed into a bout of coughing panicking Kate stepped out the room and grabbed a nurse quickly. Freddie made his way back down the corridor towards the room where Poppy was he had grabbed a sandwich and ate it on his way back determined not to stay away from Poppy for more than 10 minutes. Walking in he saw Kate standing at the end of the bed and a nurse bending over it. When the nurse pulled back he saw for the first time in three days Poppy eyes staring back at him.[Chapter 6] Again I'm so, so, so, so, so sorry that i haven't updated in ages please don't hurt me i didn't mean to please forgive me and here's another chapter to apologize. Please review. Chapter 6: \"Poppy\" he said sounding breathless as Freddie made his way to the side of the bed clutching at her hand which was lying by her side. \"Freddie oh Freddie I'm sorry\" Poppy said starting to cry then continued. \"I wrote that email weeks ago i feel so different now really please believe me\" Freddie now had tears in his eyes as well and with his other hand reached up and wiped the tears of her face. \"I love you\" and then leaning in kissed her gently but sweetly. Kate who had watched all of this was smiling happily. Poppy looked up to see Kate still standing there and reluctantly detached herself from Freddie and beckoning Kate over hugged her tight. Drippys phone sat on the coffee table in the hotel room that the girls shared the telly was on but no one was watching it they were all just thinking about Poppy things like what if she didn't make it? And we should have believed her about the email? The mobile rang making all the girls jump in shock and reach for the phone at once Josie got it first and putting to her ear said. \"Hello Kate how's Poppy what's happening is Freddie okay?\" Josie said all of this in quick succession not giving Kate a chance to speak. The rest of the girls were watching Josie as she listened to Kate. Josie then hanged up and stood there just holding the phone in her hands staring into space. \"Josie, Josie what's wrong\" Drippy said Josie continued to just stand there then all of a sudden she smiled broadly and said. \"She's awake, she's awake, she's awake\" again and again all the time getting louder and louder. The other girls caught on quickly and soon all of them were jumping up and down saying it as well. Kate hanged up smiling knowing it wouldn't be long till the rest of her friends turned up at the hospital Freddie was still sitting on the edge of Poppy's bed when she went back into the room both were just staring at each other with loving eye's. \"Come on you lovebirds the doctor will be in soon \"Kate said shocking both of them Kate laughed at the looks on their faces and it wasn't long before they were laughing as well. \"Ah Miss Moore your awake i see have a nice nap\" Poppy didn't find this amusing unlike Kate and Freddie who smirked slightly. \"Ok doctor check me over i want out of this bed and back to the shops as quickly as possible please\" the doctor just shook his head and proceeded to check her over. \"Mr Kinsley and Miss?\" the doctor said turning to Freddie and Kate. \"Just call me Kate\" Kate said confused the doctor had a grave face on but before she could ask any questions the doctor said. \"Well Kate and Mr Kinsley could you wait outside for a moment i need to talk to Miss Moore alone\" Freddie looked like he was about to argue but Poppy giving a look to Kate got her to grab him and drag him out the room. \"Doctor what's wrong\" Poppy said turning to him not bothering to hide the fear that was welling up inside of her. \"Well Miss Moore your okay\" \"Well why do you want to talk?\" Poppy said starting to get angry the doctor just shook his head and continued. \"Your okay but the damage to your legs means that you may never walk again I'm so sorry\" \"No\" \"Miss Moore I'm sorry there is a chance though so...\" \"No I need to walk i need to help win the lacrosse tournament\" the doctor didn't know what to say to the girl though she was shaking her head and silent tears were streaming down her face when he left Poppy was just sitting stock still in her bed sobbing uncontrollably. \"No, No, No\" she said over and over again. Freddie watched as the doctor made a slow progress down the hallway before going back into the room. \"Poppy what's wrong\" he said seeing her crying into her hands. Looking up she saw Freddie back in the room that she was in and all her thoughts about what had happened, the news she had just received and her feelings came rushing back all at once making her fall into a dead faint.[Chapter 7] You all probably hate me right now because i haven't updated in ages but i have to say i humbly apologize and beg your forgive to do this i present you the gift of a new chapter. Chapter 7: \"What's wrong Poppy\" Katie asked once Poppy came round but she didn't get an answer only a shake of the head between uncontrollable sobs. \"Please Poppy tell me\" Freddie said on the verge of tears himself. \"I...I can...\" but stopped when Drippy, Josie and Kiki practically fell into the room in there hast. \"POPPY!\" all three screamed at once hugging there friend tightly. \"Poppy oh Poppy what's wrong\" Kiki said handing her a tissue. \"I can never walk again\" Poppy said bluntly not looking at any of the faces knowing what their reaction would be and she wasn't disappointed when stunned silence fell on to the room. \"Just leave\" she said trying to cover her head with the blanket but couldn't because Freddie wouldn't let her. \"I'm not leaving\" he said looking into her eyes. \"You know never usually means small chance\" Josie said all of a sudden. \"Yeah there always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always...\" Drippy started saying. \"Get to the point\" Freddie said irritably form lack of food and sleep. \"...always is a chance\" Drippy finished. For the rest of the day Poppy was visited by her father, sister, Mrs Kinsley and even Matron but Freddie, Kate, Kiki, Josie and Drippy stayed by her side all the time especially when she told everyone about how the doctor says there a chance she'll never walk again. Poppy stayed in the hospital for another week before being discharged and going to stay at the hotel with everyone else. Being in a wheelchair annoyed her immensely because she had to ask everyone to help her. She shared a room with Kate and Freddie was in an adjoining room next to theirs. It was the fifth night staying in the hotel and Kate wasn't in the room because she had to go stay with her family for a couple of days but promised to come back as quickly as she could Poppy woke up because of a sharp pain that went right through her. \"Damn\" Poppy said then stopped she could feel something at the bottom of the bed it was just the blanket but she could feel it a feeling she had not had for over a week now she hesitated then tried and her leg moved slightly not wasting any time Poppy with some help from her hands got her legs over the bed it was exhausting though but the glimmer of hope that she might be able to walk was inside of her. \"Please, please, please\" she whispered before pulling herself up out of the bed onto her feet though she was clinging to the bedside table she was still standing and she could feel the carpet underneath her feet. \"FREDDIE, FREDDIE!\" she shouted in her excitement only seconds later Freddie barrelled through the door in a state of panic. \"Look\" Poppy said before wobbling and falling just being caught by Freddie. \"I can't believe it\" he said breathlessly. \"Can you stand again\" he said also feeling that small bit of hope he did like Poppy. Poppy didn't respond just held onto Freddie as she tiredly pulled her feet back into a standing position. \"Well it's not always that Dippy is right\" she said jokingly making them both laugh. Freddie stayed with Poppy for the rest of the night helping her back into the bed before lying next to her and pulling her close.[Chapter 8] Just looked at the amount of review and it's just wow over fifty reviews that's the most I've had on any of my stories so here is an update to celebrate. Also since your all good at reviewing please could you have a quick look at my other stories as well i would appreciate it because lots of reviews make me write faster...most of the time...sometimes...ok very rarely but still please review. Chapter 8: The next morning Poppy woke up to find Freddie next to her and she thought to herself I wouldn't mind waking up every day like this. \"Hey good morning flower\" Freddie said pulling Poppy out of her thoughts and turning her head saw him sitting up slightly propping himself up using his elbow. \"So...\" she said not knowing what to say and he was not so helpful by saying. \"So?\" \"How about we get up and I'll try and stand again\" Poppy said and Freddie nodding seriously shuffled out of bed grabbing Poppy's hand who used him as a kind of walking stick as she pulled herself into a standing position it was exhausting but she still had a smile on her face. \"Can you walk though that's the thing\" Freddie said making her smile falter. \"I don't know and this is going to sound silly but I think I've forgotten how to walk\" Poppy said blushing slightly Freddie though just smiled encouragingly at her and said. \"Well one foot at a time is the common way but we could try two feet at once what do you think\" making her giggle and the sound of her laughing lifted his spirits immensely. Poppy was still laughing when looking over at an armchair gasped in horror and said. \"Oh my god this is a Gucci coat it should be hung up properly not slung over a chair and striding over picked the coat up before making her way to the wardrobe but freezing completely half way there Freddie was just standing in the same spot by the bed mouth gaping. \"I can walk\" she said quietly looking down and wiggling her toes slightly. \"I CAN WALK!\" she screamed leaping into Freddie's arms making him fall over both rolled around on the carpet laughing hysterically. Meanwhile Drippy and Kate were downstairs in the breakfast room and even though no one else was awake yet they didn't care because both were still feeling guilty about Poppy Kate was thinking about if she had just believed Poppy in the first place none of this would of happened she didn't know how but she still felt that way. Drippy though was thinking about how she should have fought harder against matron and pulled Poppy out of the room she would be fine and they would all be now training furiously for the lacrosse finals. While having there measly breakfast of cereal the last person any of them wanted to see walked in. \"Well I heard Poppy is going to be fine but what could you expect from a good for nothing liar she wasn't hurt at all if she was why would she be in a hotel and not a hospital\" Harriet said sneering at them and looking around expecting Poppy to come out of nowhere. \"Leave Harriet\" Kate said not even looking up knowing that if she did she would not be able to resist the urge to smack Harriet right in the face. \"No I don't think I will I see Poppy is not so popular now is she only two stayed behind for her oh well\" Drippy turned to Harriet intending to beat her up but Harriet had already strode off into the hotel lobby content. \"Ha it seems my dear Freddie has left that little tart\" Harriet said smiling to herself but that smile dropped when she saw Freddie walking into the lobby with Poppy clinging to his arm obviously needing help in supporting herself (even though Poppy could walk now the effort exhausted her so she still needed help) \"Oh Freddie that so kind of you to help Poppy but she's obviously down the stairs now so you can leave her with Kate and Drippy and we'll go out for the day\" Harriet said smiling benignly up at Freddie making him cringe slightly. \"No, no I think I'd rather stay with Poppy\" He said trying to step past Harriet but found his path blocked again. \"But I'm your love not her\" Harriet said putting on what she thought was a pet lip and what made her face look more like a troll's. \"Harriet I never loved you\" Freddie said looking confused. \"Yes Harriet Freddie loves me\" Poppy said watching Harriet turn to her and her face turning scarlet. \"YOU HOW COULD HE LOVE YOU YOUR NOTHING BUT A TROLLOP!\" Harriet screamed at Poppy earning disapproving looks from everyone in the hotel lobby. Poppy went to open her mouth to give a retort back but Freddie beat her to it. \"Harriet how dare you call Poppy that after what she's been through and now let's get this straight I never loved you and never will now leave before I call the police...oh and never come near me or Poppy again\" Harriet stared at him for a moment before bursting into angry tears, turning on the spot and flouncing out of the hotel with what dignity she had left (which wasn't very much) \"Freddie you didn't have to stand up for me like that\" Poppy said. \"Well I wanted too and she got what she deserved\" Freddie said hugging her close. \"Oh and Freddie...\" Poppy said hugging him back. \"Yes?\" \"What's a trollop?\" Definition: Trollop – another name for a prostitute[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: Fights \"Miss Moore put your left leg forward slowly\" Poppy was at the hospital and were testing her legs to see if they worked completely because even though she could walk it was very hard and exhausting. \"You're doing great Miss Moore...\" the doctor said after he had helped her to a seat. \"...in a few days you'll be able to go home\" \"What do you mean the schools burnt down?\" Poppy said confused because to tell the truth she hadn't thought ahead very much but she knew they couldn't stay in the hotel forever. \"Oh you didn't know your fathers taking you back to LA where you will get a weekly check up to see how you're doing...\" the doctor said. \"...you mean you didn't know\" \"No I didn't know if you would excuse me\" Poppy stood up and managed to get to the door and opening it before stepping out once and feeling her leg wobble. \"Careful what did me, the doctor and everyone in general say about taking it slow and easy\" Freddie said catching Poppy as her leg started to give way. \"Freddie come on were going to see my father\" Poppy said straightening herself up and starting to walk off down the corridor at a slow and steady pace so the same thing wouldn't happen again Freddie still insisted in taking her arm and walking close to her so he could catch her again if she fell. \"Freddie you don't have to guard me\" Poppy said once they reached the car and he opened the door for her. \"I'm not guarding you am just making sure your OK\" he said slamming the door and making his way to the other side of the car. \"Well I just think that if you and everyone really left me alone to just do something I've been doing since well birth\" Poppy said annoyed as they drived down the road. \"And what is that exactly\" he said angrily as he parked the car outside of the hotel. \"Life my own life by myself\" with that Poppy got out of the car and slammed the door. \"DAD!\" Gerry Moore heard loud banging on his hotel door. \"Come in\" he said amused and watched his eldest daughter staggered into the room. He was so proud of her for what she had accomplished and beating all the odds so she could walk again. \"Hi Poppy how are you feeling?\" \"Why are we going back to LA?\" she said sitting on the bed and glaring at her father who sighed and sat on the bed next to her. \"Poppy you're getting better now and I think we need to be in our own home while you recover\" \"Dad I want to stay here with my friends and Freddie\" Poppy said. \"Well Poppy I think you should come back with me because what of a heard of those friends of yours they are getting you into a lot of trouble\" \"What but that was all me they wouldn't have done it otherwise I wanted to get expelled\" Gerry looked at his daughter he didn't want to argue with her especially because she had just recovered but he had to say his mind. \"Well Poppy there's no problem were going back to LA in a couple of days and that's it\" Poppy couldn't believe what her father was saying how could he tear her away from the first proper friends and boyfriend she had ever had. I have updated again and it has been a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time so I am so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, sorry. A question in one of the reviews for my last question was where I got the word trollop and to answer the question you tend to pick up on new words after having to watch endless hours of Catherine Cookson films.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10: Last time \" Well Poppy there's no problem were going back to LA in a couple of days and that's it\" Poppy couldn't believe what her father was saying how could he tear her away from the first proper friends and boyfriend she had ever had. Poppy had continued to argue with her dad even after he said that but it was useless the tickets were booked and in a couple of days she would be flying back to LA the prospect of leaving her friends put Poppy in a bad mood and she sulked in her hotel room. \"Hey you know as soon as I can I'll come to visit you\" Freddie said to her Poppy was sitting on the armchair in the room him perched on the arm. \"I know but I don't want to leave in the first place there's so many other girls you could have other than me\" \"Don't worry Poppy we'll keep an eye on him\" Drippy said from the bed where the whole gang was lounging. \"Yeah we'll lock him away until you come and claim him\" Josie said laughing. \"Hahaha very funny\" Poppy said smiling Freddie on the other hand said. \"Do you lot really think I'm that unfaithful to trouble here\" he said this very seriously making the entire girls laugh even more. \"Oh Freddie we're just kidding\" Josie managed to gasp out between fits of laughter. A few days later Poppy was stood in the departure lounge of the airport Freddie with an arm around her waist and her friends all gathered around saying a last goodbye which involved a lot of tears. \"I'll miss you trouble\" Freddie said hugging Poppy tightly as soon as they were alone. \"I'll miss you too promise to come over soon and introduce the fabulous chip buttie into my house\" Poppy said tears were streaming from her eyes but she still managed a smile at her own pathetic joke. \"Ok then\" Freddie said simply smiling as well then with one last kiss they parted. BRINGBRINGBRING Poppy rolled over in her sleep she had got back to LA at midnight last night and had went to bed straight away as her mobile continued to ring though she groaned and sat up brushing her brown hair out of her eyes which were still closed on another ring of the phone though she snapped them open and frantically reached for it. \"Hello\" she said hearing for the British accent she had come to love but instead an excited squeal. \"Poppy babe's your back thank god\" sighing Poppy fell back onto the pillow. \"Ruby what do you want\" \"Oh just to congratulate you on getting off that miserable island\" Poppy had heard enough though and hung up getting up she made her way to the kitchen where her sister Molly was sitting at the table. \"Hi Mol's how are you\" Molly looked up and smiled. \"Yeah I'm fine I heard your phone ring who was it?\" \"Oh just Ruby\" Molly looked confused usually when Ruby phoned her and Poppy would talk for at least an hour but by the sound of it the conversation only lasted about 2 minutes. \"You've changed Poppy\" Molly stated. \"Well you know dad was right boarding school put me straight you'd love it Molly great friends and the best boy ever\" \"Oh go on\" Molly said interested she had, had to stay in LA while her father went to England after the fire the only updates that Molly had got was whether Poppy was getting better other than that nothing. \"Well his names Freddie Kingston and he's the headmistresses son but we just get along so well at first we just snuck around but after the fire we came into the open and everyone's okay with it\" \"Well glad you found somebody better then Rodney\" Molly said making a face at the boys name Poppy laughed and said. \"Yeah I don't know what I was thinking\" \"That he's a cute, irresistible and really sexy\" Molly and Poppy swivelled around Ruby was in the doorway. \"Ruby what...\" Poppy spluttered. \"Well babe's when you hung up on me I realised something must be wrong so I rushed straight down here and Pop's brown hair is so not in so we may want to dye that again\" Ruby continued not giving ever Poppy or Molly time to protest.[Chapter 11] Hello I'm back and I am so sorry that it's been so long. I think this story is not far of completing so I will try to get it done as fast as I can. Chapter 11: Last time \" That he's a cute, irresistible and really sexy\" Molly and Poppy swivelled around Ruby was in the doorway. \" Ruby what...\" Poppy spluttered. \"Oh don't worry I made sure he waited for your return and now that your here you can claim him back\" Ruby smiled at them then tottering over to the kitchen table in her designer stilettos she dumped her designer bag on the table. \"So You managed to get off that island I did some more research and I think England is one of the worst places in the world not much shopping other then London and so cold and miserable thank god your back in sunny LA\" (AN that hurt me to write that because I'm English and love every part of England from the North to the South) Poppy had finally snapped out of her trance though. \"Ruby shut up England is amazing at Abbey Mount I had friends who liked me for me and not how many designer shoes I had or how much money my daddy could give me you didn't even ask if I was okay after nearly being burned alive now get out\" Molly silently cheered before like Poppy standing defiantly in front of Ruby arms folded. \"Well Roddy never liked you any way you know he got with me as soon as you left\" Ruby waited for a reaction from Poppy but she just stood there. \"Ruby get out now\" Molly said and finally the girl got the idea and Stormed out of the house slamming the door behind her. \"So I'm a social reject now bet she's on her phone now telling everyone that I'm a freak\" Poppy said still standing in the same position. \"Well join the club\" Molly said bitterly turning back to the kitchen. \"What do you mean?\" Molly sighed exasperated before turning back to her sister. \"Poppy you've always had people around you liking you your Miss Popular even in England you seemed to have got a large group of friends but I well I don't seem to have your talent...\" \"What but you told me you had lots of friends over email and even before I went\" Poppy was confused now but when she thought about it Molly always mentioned friends but never a number and rarely a name. \"Poppy I have two friends at school the rest of the snobby princesses, no offence, think I'm a freak\" Molly couldn't believe she was talking to Poppy about this but her sister had changed seems a new country is all that was needed. \"Three friends\" \"What?\" Molly said looking confused. \"Three friend because Molly I will always be your friend\" the two sisters moved closer and then hugged a gesture rarely seen in the Moore household but very much needed at this point. \"Well these two other friends of yours why don't you invite them over so I can meet them and then we can go in the pool maybe\" Poppy said once detached from Molly who at Poppy's suggestion immediately reached for her phone and called her friends. The rest of the day was spent by the pool as Poppy suggested because while she loved England the tanning opportunities were few and far between also she was able to get to know Molly's friends. Molly first introduced Danielle a shy girl who barely spoke to Poppy at first but as she got more comfortable she found the girl to have the same humour as Drippy just quieter. Molly second friend was a boy called Liam who blushed a lot Poppy noticed when Molly came out in her bikini making Poppy start plotting in her head to get the two together.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12: \"I can't believe you?\" Molly said to her sister a couple of days later as Poppy helped her do her hair into an over one-shoulder style. \"How did you even get that note to him anyway?\" Molly continued when Poppy didn't answer her sister just smiled knowingly and said. \"Ask me no questions and I will tell you no lies\" but Molly knew already Danielle was just as scheming as Poppy if she wanted to be. \"So he knows he's meeting a girl but he doesn't know it's you\" Poppy said finishing Molly's hair and turning her to the mirror. \"It's Liam he'll not like me like that,\" Molly said blushing and looking at herself in a strapless blue summer dress. \"Well the way he was looking at you the other day was not the look of a friend and if I'm wrong I'll go right up to Ruby and kiss her Gucci heels\" Poppy said hugging Molly before ushering her out of the door. \"Oh there so cute'\" Poppy said from a café in the mall where she was sitting with Danielle on a table behind a large plant. Liam and Molly were sitting at another café on the opposite side both Liam and Molly blushing and holding hands. \"You don't know how long I have been waiting for them to realise they are perfect for each other\" Danielle said taking her eye's away from the couple to take a sip from her hot chocolate. \" Come on lets leave them to it I need to go shopping anyway\" Poppy said taking Danielle's hand and dragging her to the nearest clothes store. \"You are as bad as my sister for shopping but a lot less critical\" Danielle said leaning back against the changing room wall in the time they had been shopping Poppy had learnt that Danielle lived in Jeans and t-shirts and refused to wear any form of dress or skirt or heels. \"Who's your sister then?\" Poppy asked coming out in another outfit she had chosen. \"Rachel Hayes\" Danielle said with a sneer of disgust. \"OMG Rachel Hayes who buys a new outfit for nearly every hour of the day\" Poppy said in shock Rachel Hayes was one of the friends that abandoned her as soon as she found out about her telling Ruby off. \"I hate her all she ever does is get dad to give her more money and get mum to try and get me like her\" Poppy felt so guilty now she used to do that to Molly as well and right in front of her was a similar situation. \"Why don't you ask for money from your dad?\" Poppy asked not knowing what else to say. \"Because I don't want to do that I have a paper round and I try to safe a lot of my money up so that I don't have to life of my dad\" Danielle said. \"That's great Danielle and I have to say you are much better then your sister\" Poppy said hugging Danielle and then saying. \"Now we'll get you in a nice outfit and then go to the place where I know your sister will be who by the way stuffs her bras\" Poppy said making Danielle squeal with laughter. \"Now hold your head up and strut in there and show your sister that you can look awesome in a style you feel comfortable in\" Poppy said pushing Danielle into the diner where everyone she used to be friends with met to show off there outfits, boyfriends or celebrity party invite. \"Hey dude look at that girl\" Roddy said nudging his equally dimwitted friend and nodding at the girl with brown hair who just walked in wearing red skinny jeans black boots and a black lace top. \"Babe what you looking at\" Rachel said looking in the direction of the girl and felt her jaw hit the floor. \"Danielle, Danielle\" Rachel said after stalking over to her sister who ignored her briefly before turning. \"Yes Rachel\" Danielle said. \"What are you doing here?\" Rachel asked. \"Well I'm having a drink\" Danielle said feeling the last of her courage drain away as Rachel looked her up and down and scoffed. \"No your leaving paper girls don't come here\" Danielle seemed to wilt again seeing Rachel who was taller with her heels and stick thin in a short summer dress while she was short and still had baby fat. \"Well this independent girl comes in here\" Poppy said appearing out of nowhere and defending Danielle. \"Oh Poppy I heard you'd gone ugly\" Rachel said stepping back slightly at the appearance of Poppy. \"Well you know what I'm embarrassed that I used to be like you and Danielle here is a great person and I'm glad she's my friend\" Poppy said and then turning on her hells stalked out Danielle following behind. Okay now guys please review and while you are at it please give me ideas for what can happen next in this story nothing too tragic though. ","Summary":" This is a random idea i had one night and don't know if it will turn out good or not so please revi"},{"Movie":"Wild Child","Title":"The Ashes","Author":"AsAmyAsAlways","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12964617","Passage":"[Chapter 1] As soon as I stepped out of the airport, I immediately turned around and hurried back inside, through the sliding glass doors. It was absolutely freezing. I opened my bag and pulled out three extra layers worth of clothing and quickly pulled them on. It was definitely a change to what I was used to back home. For me, home was Sydney, Australia and when I'd left it had been forty degrees Celsius and here in England my phone read only two. Each year my school picks one girl to go to England to study for a term at Abbey Mount School. The school was very different to mine. Mine was small and struggled to keep itself open as money was tight and they were barely able to scrape together the money to send me this year. But nether the less, here I am, ready for the experience of a lifetime. Here, in England, it was the school's final term, but back home it was only term two. So, as my normal school year was almost half way through, theirs was about to end. I braced myself and wrapped my scarf tighter around my neck before heading back, out into the freezing wind. It was only six in the morning but there were already black taxis lined up along the turning circle of Heathrow Airport. \"Abbey Mount, please.\" I said to one of the drivers as I climbed into the back seat. \"Sure thing, Darling.\" She replied. Abbey Mount was an hour away from the centre of London and as the sun rose over the city I noticed my reflection in the window. Ew, serious jetlag face. My hair was a mess, which was no surprise but this went to a whole new level. It was wavy and brown with sun-bleached ends due to all the time I spent at the beach and it reached a few inches below my shoulders. But today it was all sticking out at weird angles and looked like a family of birds had been living out of it. I used my fingers and combed through the tangled mess until it looked a little more normal. Then I re-applied some powder foundation to my face to cover up the bags under my eyes thanks to the twenty-four hours travel with no sleep. After that, I looked at least slightly more acceptable. As the hour ticked by and the city gave way to valleys and fields, I started to get more and more nervous. Just the typical nerves of anticipation; butterflies in stomach, sweaty palms and…yep, another bathroom visit was due. However, as I languished in my nervousness, I didn't notice the large manor looming up in front of the taxi. It finally caught my eye and I goggled at it's amazing features. It was a brown brick, u-shaped building with white window details, which made it seem like a mix between Hogwarts and Downton Abbey. It had a neat garden in the courtyard and a gravel walkway leading from the main entrance's steps to the driveway. \"Here you go Miss. Abbey Mount.\" The taxi driver said as we pulled up in front of the school. I thanked her before climbing out with my suitcase in tow. As I took a deep breathe and looked around at my new home, a tall woman with honey coloured hair hurried down the steps and smiled as she reached me. \"Charlie Webster?\" she asked. \"Yes.\" I nodded. \"I'm Mrs Kingsley, Head Mistress of Abbey Mount. It's wonderful to finally meet you.\" She beamed. \"It's good to finally be here.\" I replied, returning her smile. \"Well, come inside. The rest of the school arrived yesterday, but we've assigned you a room and you'll be all ready for when the term begins tomorrow.\" She explained as she lead me into the large, wood and marble inlaid hallway. As she explained the school rules and what I was to expect here, we walked through winding corridors and I lost count of how many flights of stairs we climbed, but finally we reached room number five-seven-zero. \"Your room mates will make you feel welcome and help you with anything you need.\" Mrs Kingsley finished before leaving me alone in the corridor. I swallowed my nerves and knocked on the door before pushing it open slightly. \"Hi.\" I said as I saw four girls bustling about the room. One of them had a Wagon Wheel in hand and had blonde, frizzy hair. Another one with light brown hair was busy sorting through her suitcase, beside two more, both with dark hair who seemed to be arguing about a shirt. As soon as they saw me, they all stopped what they were doing and turned around to look at me. The room was silent except for the bang of the door as it closed behind me. \"I'm Charlie.\" I added. \"Oh, Charlie. Nice to meet you.\" The one with light brown hair said. \"I'm Kate. This is Kiki…\" she said and pointed to one of the dark haired girls with a floppy side fringe, who smiled at me. \"Josie…\" Kate continued, pointing at the other dark haired girl. \"…And Drippy.\" She finished and pointed to the girl with the Wagon Wheel. \"Hi. Nice to meet you all.\" I said, returning their smiles. \"Are you from America?\" Drippy asked. \"No. I'm the exchange student from Australia.\" I replied. \"Oh, that's so cool.\" She replied and she paused before adding shyly: \"Did you know, you can only get Tim Tams in Australia?\" \"Yes, I did know that.\" I replied and opened my bag. \"That's why a brought enough to last me the term. Help yourselves.\" I grinned and held up two huge packs. \"I love you.\" Drippy said happily and practically fell onto them. \"Don't let Matron catch you with those. I suggest locking them away.\" Kate suggested and I nodded at her advice. \"Long day of travelling?\" Kiki asked. \"Kind of.\" I replied. \"Well, why don't you go down to the change rooms, have a shower and then we'll be quiet so you can catch up on some zs.\" She advised. \"That's the best advice I've had all day.\" I replied. However, that was easier said then done. This school was like a rabbit warren, but after twenty minutes of wandering around, I finally found the change rooms. There were benches along each wall and two in the middle of the room, with a sidewall jutting out to hide the room from the toilets and the opposite wall had a long line of showers with lockable wooden doors. One of the showers was already occupied and I dumped my clothes on one of the centre benches, before pulling my jumped over my head and then my t-shirt. I was about to un-zip my jeans, when whoever was in the shower turned off the water and opened the door. I glanced up and expected to see a girl but instead a boy around my age, with blonde curly hair walked out. For a second I froze in horror. This wasn't happening. I only had a split second before he noticed me, so I spun around and ducked behind the brick wall, but I mustn't have been fast enough. \"Who's there?\" he called. I squeezed my eyes shut and hoped that if I didn't reply he'd think he'd imagined it. \"Hello?\" he called again and I heard him walking towards where I was hiding. \"No, no. Uh, stay there.\" I said back, worried that he would come all the way around. There was a moment of silence as he realised it was the voice of a girl. \"Uh, you can't be in here.\" He said. \"Aren't you the one in the girls change room?\" I retaliated. \"I'm pretty sure those are urinals over there.\" He said and I could hear the smirk in his tone as I looked beside me and saw the wall of urinals. I cursed inwardly and hit the wall with the back of my head in annoyance. I chanced a glance around the wall and saw the boy with his arms folded and white towel wrapped around his waist smirking at me and I quickly hid back behind the wall. \"Oh, well, uh. My mistake. It's been a long day.\" I stammered. \"Could you please turn around?\" I asked. \"Sure.\" He chuckled and I looked around the corner to see him walk back over to the showers and face the wall. I took my chance and ran out from behind the wall, hurriedly pulling on my t-shirt as I reached my things. \"Uh, thanks.\" I said as I grabbed my things and ran out of the room before anything else could go wrong. After checking I was in the right change room I showered, changed and then hurried back up to my room, begging that I wouldn't run into that boy on the way back to my room. I burst back into the room and sighed in relief that I'd finally reached a safe zone. \"Are you okay? You look very frazzled.\" Kate asked. \"Yeah, I'm fine. I just almost took a shower in the boys change room.\" I admitted and sat down on the end of my bed. \"You what?\" Kiki gaped. \"Did anyone see you?\" Josie cried. \"No, thank goodness.\" I lied. \"Wow. What an introduction to your first day at Abbey Mount.\" Kate laughed and I couldn't help but laugh as well. I looked down at my bag to find my phone when I noticed only one pack of Tim Tams on my suitcase. \"Um, where did the other packet go?\" I asked no one in particular. \"Well, um, you did say to help yourselves.\" Drippy said quietly a handed me back the empty. \"Fair enough. I did. I'll see if my parents can send over some extra supplies.\" I grinned. Not long after that I lay down on my bed and almost as soon as my head hit the pillow I was asleep, dreaming of what life would be like at Abbey Mount.[Chapter 2] The next morning I was started awake by a loud bell ringing outside. I looked around the room and saw the others beginning to stir. \"Come on. Time for breakfast.\" Kate said as she threw back her covers and pulled a checkered skirt out of her suitcase. \"Matron delivered a uniform for you, Charlie.\" She added and pointed to the end of my bed where a neat pile sat on top of my suitcase. I rolled out of bed and put on my new school uniform, which consisted of a white shirt, black cardigan or jumper, a blue, green and grey checkered skirt and matching tie, black, knee-high socks and a grey blazer with the school's crest on the breast pocket. As I followed the others down to breakfast I hurriedly pulled my hair back into a high ponytail and tied a white ribbon around the elastic. We walked into a large hall, which had long wooden tables and benches down one side and opposite them was an especially large table where Mrs Kingsley and the other teachers were waiting. I stood beside Drippy at the end of one of the tables, facing the doorway we'd just come through, as the rest of the school filed in. As I was looking around the long hall, a tall blonde girl came and stood in front of me. She had bright, blue eyes and her curly hair was pulled back into a braid. Her uniform was impeccable and she was flanked by two other girls who stood behind her. \"Harriet. Head girl.\" The blonde girl said and stuck her hand out towards me. \"Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Charlie.\" I said, shaking her hand. \"Mm, pleasure.\" She said a little too sweetly, as she looked down her nose at me. I didn't say anything and just smiled at her, ignoring the attitude. \"Hm. Australian?\" she asked. \"Yes.\" I replied. \"I thought so. I've been to Australia before. We stayed in Circular Quay.\" She said pronouncing 'Quay' like an A. \"Ah, it is lovely there. But it's actually pronounced 'Quay' as in 'Key'.\" I said, trying to be helpful. \"I know. I was just testing you to see if you knew what I was talking about. You know...you don't seem like the scholarly type.\" She said and I was surprised at how openly rude she was. \"Well, perhaps I'll surprise you.\" I said with a smile. \"Just make sure you know the rules of respect around here. Teachers, prefects, scholars, students, vermin, bogans.\" She said, putting extra emphasis on the last word. \"As you were.\" She smiled, before turning and walking majestically away. \"Ugh. Stay away from her if you can. She may seem sweet and caring, but she'll only be that way to those she knows she can walk on.\" Kiki said. \"Thanks for the advice.\" I smiled nervously. \"Well hello, Freddy.\" Drippy said beside me. I looked in confusion to where she was looking and at that moment I wished I was anywhere but here, I wished I could turn invisible or sink through the floor, but unfortunately none of those wishes came true. Walking through the doors and making his way over to the head table was the same curly haired boy I'd met in the change rooms. Okay. As long as he doesn't see me…as long as he doesn't see me. He's seen me. As he walked past our table and joined the heads, he happened to glance our way and while the others smiled at him I became very interested in my shoelaces. \"Find the change rooms okay?\" he asked. I looked up quickly while I dug my nails into the palms of my hands. \"Yes, thank you.\" I said between slightly clenched teeth and he grinned before turning around and joining the head table. \"What was that about?\" Josie asked me. \"I'll explain later.\" I promised as Kate looked down at her watch. \"And cue Harriet in three, two, one. Contact.\" She counted down and I watched as Harriet walked over to Freddy and began speaking with him. Up at the head table, Mrs Kingsley rang a small bell and everyone began to sit down, so I followed suit as plates of toast started to be handed round. \"I love that Freddy's always here.\" Drippy said happily. \"Um, who is Freddy?\" I asked. \"Mrs Kingsley's son. Devastating heartthrob. He goes to school at our brother school further up the road, but he lives here with his Mum.\" She replied. The Headmistress' son. Of all people. \"And are he and Harriet a, thing?\" I asked. \"Oh, she wishes. Poor guy.\" Kate laughed. \"So, what's this about change rooms?\" Kiki asked me. \"Yeah. Plus, when he came in you went bright red.\" Josie added. \"Okay, yesterday, I lied. Someone did see me.\" I admitted. \"Oh no. It wasn't…it was.\" Drippy gasped, realising what I was saying and I brought my hand up to my forehead. \"Were you…were you, decent?\" she asked. \"Just.\" I replied. \"But it was still totally embarrassing.\" \"Well at least you weren't naked.\" Josie said. \"And an added bonus. You didn't see Harriet's face when he came to talk to you, but it looked like steam was about to pour out of her ears.\" Kate giggled and I couldn't help but laugh too. An hour later I sat between Josie and Drippy in our first class of the term. Geography. My favourite and best subject at my school back home. \"Good morning, class. For those of you who don't know me, my name's Mrs Erhope.\" The teacher said writing her name onto the whiteboard. \"Today we'll look at an introduction to the four spheres.\" She said. Something I'd been worried about coming here was whether I'd be able to keep up with the work because I knew they had a different curriculum to what I was used to, but thankfully I'd studied the Earth's spheres the year before. The rest of my classes didn't go too badly and I was just heading back to my room after the last one, where I rounded the corner and collided with someone coming the other way. \"Sorry.\" I said quickly, bending down to pick up my books that were now all over the floor. \"No worries.\" The person said as they bent down too and I couldn't believe my luck as I recognised the voice. \"This just keeps getting worse.\" I said, looking up at Freddy Kingsley. \"Yes, we really should stop meeting like this.\" He replied as we stood up and he handed my books back. \"Let's start over.\" I said and held out my hand. \"Charlie Webster. Nice to meet you.\" \"Freddy Kingsley.\" He said, shaking it. \"Freddy, there you are.\" I heard Harriet's voice from behind me and if I wasn't mistaken I could've sworn Freddy rolled his eyes a little. \"I was wondering if you could do me a favour. You…!\" she began as she saw me and her eyes flashed in anger when she noticed our hands were still linked. \"Good luck.\" I said to Freddy before giving him a sympathetic smile and hurrying away, leaving him deal with the roth of Harriet. \"Man! What a day!\" Drippy said as I opened the door to our dorm. She was lying face down on the floor with her books spread around her. \"Two chapters of maths homework, a whole novel to read before next class and already an assignment for geography.\" She said, her voice muffled from the carpet as I picked my way between books. \"Don't get too ahead of yourself. We've still got lacrosse training tomorrow.\" Kate reminded her. \"That reminds me. Charlie every girl at the school tries out for the lacrosse team but since you're an exchange student you immediately make the team because you're only here for a term and every girl must partake in some sporting activity at the school.\" She rattled off. \"So, since the tryouts were last year, you automatically qualify.\" \"Right.\" I said, taking it all in. \"One problem. I've never played lacrosse before.\" \"That's okay. It's pretty easy to get the hand of.\" Kate added. So, the next day I changed into the school sports uniform and followed the others down to the field in front of the school. \"Hello girls. It's good to see you all again.\" A tall woman in a tracksuit said to us. \"And welcome to lacrosse Miss Webster. My name's Miss Rees-Withers.\" She said and I smiled at her. \"Have you ever played lacross before?\" she asked and I shook my head. \"Maybe she should be a reserve.\" Harriet suggested. \"Thank you for you suggestion Harriet.\" Miss Rees-Withers replied. \"Do you play any sports back home?\" \"I play softball.\" I said. \"Well I'm sure it will come in handy. It's all sticks and balls really.\" She said and began handing out lacrosse sticks. \"Um, don't you need horses to play lacrosse?\" I said to Kate as we collected a stick and a ball between us. \"No, that's polo you daft idiot.\" She laughed. Between Josie teaching me the rules of the game and Kate helping me with my stick work, I think I finally had the hang of lacrosse. We had a practice game between ourselves and it was Kate's team versus Harriet's, and the score was one all. \"Charlie! Catch!\" One of the girls yelled to me and I put all my effort into concentrating on the round, yellow ball flying towards me. Even though it was only a practice round I didn't want to let the team down. Everything seemed to go into slow motion. I jumped to catch the ball and it was going to land right in the centre of the net, when someone barrelled into me, pushing me off course. As Harriet rammed into me and caught the ball I fell face first into a huge patch of muddy grass. I looked up just in time to see her shoot the ball past Kate and into the goal. \"So sorry about that. At least you're more at home in the dirt, bogan.\" Harriet said as she walked past me. I don't think she expected me to retaliate, but I stuck out my foot and tripped her up, so she fell into the mud too. \"Oh, I'm so sorry.\" I said sarcastically and I went to get up, but she grabbed my shirt and pulled me back into the mud. \"Hey! Hey! Break it up!\" Miss Rees-Withers yelled at us in between blowing on her whistle, as I threw a handful of mud at Harriet. Harriet and I both looked up as there was the sound of a car's horn being beeped from the road. Of course, as usual the only person to see me in my most embarrassing situations was Freddy Kingsley, sitting in an old green car. Harriet leapt up and I went to get up too, but she leant on my shoulder to stand up and as a result pushed me back down. Instead of trying to get up again and more than likely being pushed down once more, I stayed on the ground, crossing my legs and folded my arms in defiance. \"Shouldn't you guys be in bikinis for that?\" Freddy asked. \"Hey Fredster. Diggin' car.\" Harriet said cooly. \"Hello, Miss Webster.\" He said to me. \"Hi.\" I replied, waving my hand vaguely as he grinned and then roared away. \"What?\" I asked Harriet as I stood up and saw her glaring at me. \"Girls. That is no way to behave or settle your disagreements.\" Miss Rees-Withers scolded. \"In usual cases I'd send you both to see the Head Mistress but I'd like you both to act your age and work it out like the young ladies you are. Yes?\" \"Yes, Miss.\" I said glumly. \"Of course, Miss Rees-Withers.\" Harriet said humbly and I restrained from rolling my eyes.[Chapter 3] It had been a week since lacrosse training and ever since Harriet had been making not just mine, but the rest of my dorm's lives a misery. Drippy had been especially upset when Harriet told Matron about her secret stash of Wagon Wheels. The girls and I decided to give her a taste of her own medicine and have devised a seamless plan. Being Head Girl meant that Harriet had certain privileges, like her own parking spot in the teacher's underground car park and she could go into town during her free classes. Harriet was also a stickler for school rules, so Kate and I had gotten our hands on one of the school flags, which bore it's crest. We then set to work covering over some of the images on the shield. We replaced a book with pictures of alcohol and a bouquet of lilies with a muscled and very tanned man in only a pair of underpants. And on the other side of the flag we stuck a large image of Harriet with a drawn on moustache, beard, mono-brow and gold crown. We then snuck down to the teacher's car park, which luckily was empty. We attached out new flag to a sturdy stick and sticky-taped it to the back number plate of Harriet's car. So she wouldn't see it, we bent the stick back and tucked the corner of the flag under the wheel, so once she drove off, the flag would spring up and she wouldn't know about it. \"What are you up to down here?\" I heard someone ask and Kate and I spun around to see Freddy looking skeptical. \"Nothing.\" I said. \"We dropped something and it rolled down here.\" Kate said calmly. \"What did you drop?\" he asked disbelievingly. \"Duct tape.\" I said, holding up the roll of tape, my poker face on point. \"It just got away from us so easily.\" I added shaking my head in disappointment. \"Right.\" He said slowly as footsteps came down the steps of the carpark. \"Crap!\" Kate hissed. \"Quick, under the car.\" I said and we crawled under the car beside Harriet's as Freddy watched in amusement. \"Freddy. What a surprise to see you down here.\" We heard Harriet's voice say. \"Harriet.\" Freddy greeted. \"I'm just heading into town. Did you need anything?\" she asked getting into her car and I had to nudge Kate to stop her from giggling. \"No thanks.\" Freddy replied. \"Okay, bye then.\" Harriet said and started her car. We watched as the back wheel rolled off the flag and it sprang into the air, and from underneath the car we watched Harriet drive up the ramp with our flag waving proudly in the air. We couldn't keep it in any longer and we burst into laughter. \"So that's what you were up to.\" Freddy said as he looked under our car. Kate and I wriggled out and managed to get our laughter under control. \"Keep your mouth shut, Kingsley. Or I'm afraid we'll have to kill you.\" I said seriously. He held his hands up in surrender and backed away. At lunch, later that day the girls and I saw Harriet in her car, returning to school, without the flag, which meant she'd probably seen it along with most of the town. Mission Accomplished. \"So, what classes does everyone have?\" I asked. \"Maths.\" Kiki and Josie said together. \"English.\" Kate said. \"French.\" Drippy sighed. \"What about you?\" \"I've got a free period.\" I replied. \"I need to make a start on this geography assignment.\" \"But don't forget girls. We have the social coming up.\" Kate said and seeing my confused face she explained. \"This term, we have two socials. One hosted by our brother school and the other hosted by us.\" \"Yeah, and then at the end of every term there's a ball.\" Drippy added. \"Wow. British people like to party.\" I said. \"When's the social?\" I asked. \"Saturday.\" Kate said. \"Is it compulsory?\" I asked. \"Oh, Charlie you just have to come. You'd be mental not to.\" Drippy insisted. \"Oh, but I don't have a thing to wear.\" I said dramatically. \"Nothing wintery anyway. I didn't think it'd be this cold here.\" \"I know the perfect place.\" Kiki said. \"It's settled then. On Saturday morning, we shop.\" Josie said pretending to hold her fork in the air like a sword. After lunch, I collected my textbook and notebook from the dorm, and since it was such a lovely day I decided to sit outside on one of the benches near the field to do my work. I put my earphones in and settled into my note making. I'd only gotten a page written before someone pulled out one of my earphones, making me jump. I looked over my shoulder and saw Freddy leaning on the back of the bench, looking over my shoulder at what I was writing. \"Studying?\" He asked. \"Yep. You probably didn't recognise me. After all you've only ever seen me making a fool of myself; dropping my books everywhere or covered in mud.\" I replied. \"Or half naked. You forgot that one.\" He added jokingly. \"I see you haven't.\" I replied. \"Of course not.\" He laughed before looking back over my shoulder. \"How the hydrosphere interacts with the biosphere.\" He read. \"Yes, and unlike you I am working hard.\" I said as he jumped over the back of the bench and sat next to me. I tried to keep reading but I could feel him watching me, so I crossed my leg and sat on the bench sideways so that I was facing him. \"What's new, Kingsley?\" I asked. \"Are you going to the social on Saturday?\" he asked. \"I don't know. This assignment has to get done and socials aren't really my scene.\" I shrugged. \"Well you should consider coming. It's always good fun.\" He said. \"I'll think about it.\" I shrugged. \"What's your assignment on, anyway?\" he asked. \"Biophysical interactions.\" I said. \"How the spheres interact with each other.\" \"Wow, that sounds…fun.\" He said and I chuckled. \"Don't you have something called 'work', to do?\" I asked. \"Unfortunately, I do. So, I'll head off and you, can go to…maths?\" he read looking at my timetable. \"Crap! I do.\" I started, jumping off the seat. \"It was nice to see you again and uh…maybe I'll see you on Saturday.\" I said, facing him as I walked backwards towards the school. \"You'll have a good time. I promise.\" He said and I waved before hurrying off to class.[Chapter 4] The rest of the week went by in a flash and before I knew it, I was on the bus with the others heading into town to go dress shopping. The little town had a wine shop, hair dressers, charity shop, a pub and a service station. I followed the others as they headed towards the charity shop. \"I don't mean to be picky and spoilt, but do you really think we'll find something in here?\" I asked them. \"You'll never know what gems you'll find.\" Kate said knowingly. So I swallowed my pride and followed them in. The five of us spent the next half an hour trailing through the shop picking out dresses and shoes. We eventually had a selection of outfits and we showed them off to each other. Kiki had chosen a grey and silver dress with thick straps and a sequined bodice, with grey tulle for the skirt, finishing just above her knee. Kate had a simple orange dress with floral straps. Josie had found a long black skirt and tucked it into a white corset with long sleeves and Drippy had a brightly coloured dress in light green, which accented her hair perfectly. I'd showed the others two choices so far but neither of them had really worked. My last chance was a little seventies but it was the last one. I opened the curtain and waited for their judgment. It was a dark blue, long sleeved completely sequined dress that finished above my knee. The neckline was high and had a zipper on the back. \"Wow. That one's perfect.\" Kate said. \"You'd be absolutely mental not to wear that one.\" Drippy said. \"I'll even bet you all my Wagon Wheels that you'll get asked to dance by at least three boys.\" \"Wow, Drippy. You are confident.\" I laughed. \"Alright, let's get these and we'll head back.\" \"Not yet. We have one more destination.\" Kate said. \"Where are we going?\" I asked once we were back out in the street. \"To get some juice.\" Kiki said. \"I'm assuming that the juice I'm thinking of, isn't the juice you're thinking of.\" I said. \"No. It's not.\" Josie replied as they headed towards the wine shop. \"What do you think they're gonna get?\" I asked Drippy and Kate as we waited for Kiki and Josie. \"I know what you're thinking and don't worry, it's nothing gastly. They'll get some cider.\" Kate assured me. \"Okay.\" I laughed nervously. Soon the pair came out of the shop with two bottles wrapped in brown paper bags. \"How did you even…\" I began. \"…know what? I don't really need to know.\" I decided. By the time we got back to Abbey Mount it was well into the afternoon. As we walked back to our dorms we saw girls running between rooms with hair straighteners, curlers and make up in their hands. Having five of us was an advantage because it made things much faster. We sat in a circle with our backs to each other as we did each other's hair. Drippy was behind me, curling my hair and I straightened Kate's hair in front of me. Once we'd finished I changed into my dress and applied some black eyeliner, silver eye shadow and a pale lipstick. \"Cheers, girls.\" Kiki said as she passed around a paper cup with cider in it. I took a sip and was taken aback by how different it tasted to the ones my parents used to let me try at home. As I would later find out, even one cup of cider on an empty stomach was a bad idea. But, nevertheless I pulled on a pair of black heals and followed the huge throng of girls out to the waiting buses that would ferry us the few minutes up the road to the boy's school. The busses were full of chatter and a mix of different types of perfume but it was exciting and I was glad that I'd decided to come afterall. It was a bumpy few minutes but we soon arrived at St Paul's School for boys. If Abbey Mount looked like Downton Abbey, then St Paul's would've looked like Hogwarts except without it's turrets. The girls and I were on the last bus and were the last ones to enter the school. We walked up the front steps, turned left and then turned into a small hall which had balloons floating at the ceiling and who I assumed was one of the teachers as a DJ. I walked behind Kate and the others, feeling a little self-conscious as everyone seemed to know each other already. As the others talked to a group of boys, I stood beside them awkwardly looking around to try and look interested in something. I didn't take too long to find something interesting to look at. On the other side of the room I spotted Freddy in a black suit and pale blue shirt, and he'd been cornered by Harriet who was chatting away, not realising that he wasn't really listening. He gazed around the room and I gave him a quick smile when his eyes found me. A strange look appeared on his face; it was a mix between a smile, and an impressed and slightly awe struck look. I stupidly turned around to see who he was looking at, and I felt myself go bright red when I realised he was looking at me. I was about to start making my way over to him when a tall, extremely good looking boy held out his hand to me. \"Hello, I'm Josh. Nice to meet you.\" He said with a dazzeling smile. \"Charlie. And it's nice to meet you too.\" I smiled back and shook his hand \"Would you care to dance?\" he asked. \"It'd be my pleasure.\" I replied and as he lead me onto the dance floor, I looked over his shoulder and saw Kate and Drippy giving me the thumbs up. I glared at them and they went back to their own conversations as I danced with Josh. However, it wasn't long before he lost interest and moved onto a girl named Catherine. I looked around to see if Freddy was still cornered by Harriet and as I suspected he was and looking desperate at this point. \"Evening Harriet, Freddy.\" I said as I joined the pair. \"Hi.\" Freddy said. \"You look lovely.\" He added casually. \"Thank you. You don't look too bad yourself. You look great too, Harriet.\" I replied and realising that she no longer had Freddy to herself anymore, Harriet flounced away. \"Do you want to dance?\" he asked. \"Sure.\" I replied with a smile. He slipped his hand into mine and I held onto his shoulder as he wrapped his arm around my back. \"I'm glad you came tonight.\" He said. \"I'm glad I did too.\" I replied. \"It beats assignments.\" \"Can't argue with that.\" He grinned. \"Are you okay? You've gone white.\" Freddy asked. \"Yeah, just a little dizzy.\" I replied, taking a deep breathe as a wave of dizziness swept over me. \"I might just go out for some fresh air.\" \"I'll join you. It is quite stuffy in here.\" He said and I followed him through the hall, past Harriet and her minions and out into the foyer where a heavily embroidered couch was waiting. \"Are you sure you're alright?\" he asked. \"Yeah, I'm fine. My friends, they bought some sort of super strength cider.\" I said. \"I see. Better not let Matron find it.\" he advised. \"I think we'll be fine. Somehow I get the feeling that this isn't their first time. \" I said, shaking my head. \"So, I didn't know lacrosse was a contact sport.\" He said, reminding me of my mud fight with Harriet. \"Well, that's how we do it in Australia. Every sport's a contact sport.\" I said. \"Even lawn bowls?\" Freddy asked. \"They're the worst of them all. Those retirees are viscous.\" I said with complete seriousness, which made him laugh. \"Speaking of sports, I go on a cricket tour on Monday, but I'll be back in two weeks. And I was thinking you might like to go into town with me. I can show you what the English beaches are like.\" He said. \"I would like that very much. But are you sure Harriet won't mind?\" I teased. \"She's not my girlfriend.\" He said, a little confused. \"And does she know that?\" I laughed. \"Well, you never know. She might cotton on soon.\" He smiled and leant forward to kiss me on the cheek. \"Oh crap.\" He muttered as he sat back and I followed his gaze to see Harriet's two minions, Charlotte and Jane, standing in the foyer. \"Fraternising with the girls, Freddy Kingsley is not allowed and you know it.\" Charlotte said. \"Charlie Webster, back inside.\" Jane said, and I gave Freddy a tiresome look before getting up and heading back inside, where I found the others sitting in a group of chairs at the side of the hall. \"Where have you been?\" Josie asked me as I joined them. \"I don't know what was in that cider you bought, but it's just earned me a trip into town.\" I said. \"What? With a boy?\" Kiki asked. \"Was it Freddy?\" Drippy asked and I nodded, which made them squeal. \"What? Why is this so exciting?\" I asked, confused. \"Oh, you sweet child. You're going on a date.\" Kiki laughed. \"What? No, he's just showing me around town.\" I replied. No one replied, except they all raised their eyebrows at me. I sighed and gave in. \"Well, I've never been on a date before. How was I supposed to know.\" I finished and they chuckled. \"And how was your night?\" I asked them, changing the subject. \"I think it's safe to say that everyone had their fair share of hits, but Drippy took home the trophy.\" Kiki said. \"Eight boys came up and directly spoke to me.\" Drippy grinned. \"Wow, Drippy. Nice work.\" I said. \"Thanks. Now I just need to beat my score at our social.\" She laughed.[Chapter 5] The next morning I was jolted awake by Kate's alarm and as the rest of the room began to stir, there was a combination of groans as everyone woke up. I turned over and looked at my clock. \"Crap! Guys, it's seven-thirty. The game starts in half an hour.\" I cried, having completely forgotten about the first lacrosse game of the season. The groans were then replaced by cries and shrieks as everyone leapt out of bed and began pulling up socks and grabbing mouth guards. We ran through the school and made it to the field just in time for the start of warm-up. \"All right girls, if we lose today, we're out of the season for good.\" Miss Rees-Withers said. \"Now let's get out there and make it count!\" I ran onto the field with the others, lacrosse stick in hand. I'd been assigned the position of goal defence and I was determined not to let them down. For my first game, I didn't think I was doing too badly, although I did miss a few catches and fumbled a few balls, but by the end of the first half the score was one-nil, to the other team. \"Don't worry girls, we can still bring this back. I'd like to make a few changes, Charlie I'd like to try you on Goal Attack and Harriet, you can take defence.\" Miss Rees-Withers said, and then the second half began. The ball was tossed into the air and Kiki caught it, dodged a huge girl and then threw the hall to Kate. She looked around for anyone who wasn't being swamped by the other team. \"Kate! I'm open!\" I yelled and she threw the ball to me, which I thankfully caught. I turned around and ran towards the goal. A girl ran at me, but I spun out of her way and suddenly the only person between the goal and me was the keeper. I went to throw it to the right and the keeper reached for it, but at the last second I threw it to her left and the ball hit the edge of the goal and bounced in. \"Ah!\" I yelled in triumphant and surprise. The rest of the team cheered too and when the ball was tossed into the air again the team had a feeling of determination about them. I caught the ball and passed it to Josie who dodged and weaved before passing it to Drippy. \"Don't pass it to me!\" she yelled as she caught the ball. \"Drippy! Shoot!\" Kiki and I yelled, and she screamed as she launched the ball at the goal and it sailed straight between the keeper's legs as the final time bell rang out. \"Yes, Drippy!\" I yelled as I ran at her and hugged her. \"You shot the winning goal!\" I yelled at her. \"I shot the winning goal. I shout the bloody winning goal!\" she screamed as the rest of the team rushed towards her. \"And a special mention to our under eighteen's lacrosse team who won their game in the first round of the regional all girl's schools competition. And congratulations to Charlie Webster and Jennifer Logan who scored the two goals.\" Mrs Kingsley announced at the school assembly the following Monday. \"Also, I want to remind everyone that as we value the relationship we have with our brother school St Pauls, we will be attending the grand final of the under eighteen's cricket team to show our support and they will come to the grand final of our under eighteen's lacrosse team.\" She said and some of the hall groaned. \"Now girls, we need to show our support for our peers.\" She finished and the hall fell silent. The next few weeks sped by. Assignments came and went, lacrosse practice was going well and we'd even one our second and third game. Freddy had returned from his cricket tour and today was the day he was going to take me into town. Or on a 'date' as the other kept insisting it was called. \"That goal was incredible.\" I said to Kate as we trooped back to our dorm. \"You shot it in from like, half way down the field. We are not worthy.\" I said, pretending to bow down to her as we entered our room. I changed out of my dirty uniform and pulled on a jumper, a pair of jeans and a pair of black boots. \"Hey, Charlie.\" Drippy called and pointed down into the garden. I joined her at the window and saw Freddy waiting by his car further down the road so we wouldn't be seen 'fraternising'. The two weeks had gone quickly, but I hadn't realised how much I'd missed seeing him around until now. \"Do I look okay?\" I asked, the excitement from the others turning into mine into nerves. \"No. You look horrendous.\" Drippy said and I gave her my best puppy-dog eyes. \"Of course. You look fine.\" \"Have fun.\" Kate said. \"Thanks guys.\" I replied. I hurried out of the room, flew past Matron and jumped down the front steps. \"Top of the morning to you.\" I said in an Irish accent as I reached Freddy and he grinned as he saw me. \"How did the cricket tour go?\" I asked. \"Really well, thank you. We're in the grand final.\" He said. \"Congratulations.\" I cried. \"And if we're in the lacrosse final then St Paul's comes to watch us.\" \"Well, if lacrosse is as entertaining as the show you and Harriet put on, then I don't think you'll have any trouble getting an audience.\" He teased. \"I look forward to the day you're old and grey and can no longer remember that.\" I replied. \"Never.\" He laughed. \"Come on. Let's hit the road.\" \"I can't believe this is your car.\" I said, admiring the dark green convertible. \"It's beautiful. An MG right?\" \"Yeah.\" Freddy said, slightly surprised. \"I didn't take you for a car person.\" \"Please, I've got three brothers.\" I replied, climbing into the seat. Freddy roared the car into life and revved the engine before driving off, down the gravel road. It was a beautiful day and the warm sun was nice against the cold wind. It wasn't long before we drove into town and Freddy parked beside a small pub overlooking the sea. \"Wow.\" I said, looking out over the water. \"Come on.\" Freddy said and headed over to a set of steps that lead down to the dark, pebbly sand. \"How 'bout a race? Stretch our legs.\" I suggested. \"Okay…go.\" He said and pushed me back a few steps before sprinting away. \"Oh, it's so on.\" I said and raced after him. We leapt down the stairs and I overtook him as we reached the sand. \"Victory!\" I cried, punching my fists into the air as I reached the water's edge and turned around to see where Freddy was. \"Ah!\" I cried as he barreled straight into me, wrapping his arms around me as we stumbled to a halt, Freddy using me as his breaks. \"I want a rematch.\" He said, letting go of me as I laughed. \"Welcome to your first English beach.\" He panted. \"It's amazing.\" I said, looking around. We sat down on the sand and chatted about this and that. He was an only child and his Father was in the Navy and had been posted in France for three years. His Father had gone to St Paul's and represented the school in cricket, so Freddy was hoping to win the grand final and follow in his footsteps. \"So, what's school like in Sydney?\" he asked me. \"Very different. Very different.\" I said. \"Most of the classrooms are demountables and no one's really heard of it before, but they've been sending people to Abbey Mount for thirty years and they do their best to continue the tradition. I'm just grateful they chose me.\" \"I'm glad they chose you too.\" Freddy said and I looked away, trying to hide my smile. \"You hungry?\" he asked. \"A bit.\" I replied. \"Great. I have something I want to you try.\" He said and pulled me up. We headed up to the bar, where I sat a table in the back as Freddy ordered some food. I looked up as he came back to the table carrying a plate with a pie on it. \"Now. Do you trust me?\" he asked, not putting the pie down on the table. \"Why?\" I asked curiously and tried to look at the pie, but he just put it behind his back. \"Because I want you to try an English delicacy but I don't want you to be put off by the sight of it.\" he said. \"What is it?\" I asked. \"It's called Stargazey Pie.\" He said. \"If it's got a name like Stargazey Pie, then it can't look that bad, surely…right?\" I asked, not knowing if I wanted to know the answer or not. \"Well, you decide.\" He said with a grin. \"But believe me when I tell you it tastes better than it looks.\" \"Alright. Fine.\" I said, giving in. \"Okay. Close your eyes.\" He grinned, and I shook my head as I closed my eyes. \"Open up.\" He said and I reluctantly opened my mouth as he fed me a piece of the pie. \"Keep your eyes closed, but how is it?\" he asked. \"It's…fine. I was expecting something weird, but it tastes like fish and potato, and it goes surprisingly well with the pastry.\" I observed. \"Excellent. Now open you eyes.\" He said and I opened them. I looked down at the pie and my eyes widened as I clapped my hand over my mouth. It looked exactly like a normal pie, except for the fact that it had four fish heads sticking out of it. \"Oh my goodness.\" I gasped. \"What is that?!\" I cried, as Freddy tried to get his laughter under control. \"Stargazey Pie.\" He laughed. \"Is that…normal?\" I asked as Freddy continued to laugh. \"Dude! I can't believe you let me put that in my mouth.\" I laughed. \"You let me.\" he said holding up his hands. \"But was it horrible?\" \"Well…no.\" I admitted. \"So if I ask you to try something else, do you trust me?\" he asked. \"... You're skating on very thin ice here. But, yeah.\" I laughed. \"That's okay. Close your eyes again.\" He said and I rolled my eyes, but obliged. I waited for him to give me something else to eat, but instead I felt his warm lips on mine. My eyes flew open and when I didn't see him back away I closed my eyes again and enjoyed the moment. I hadn't kissed anyone before. I could feel myself blushing as he pulled away and I only just managed to contain my grin. \"There's something different about you Charlie, but I just can't put my finger on it.\" he said. \"Different. Good different?\" I asked quietly. \"Good, amazing different.\" He replied and I glanced down at his lips before looking back into his blue eyes. I leant towards him and he did the same, our lips meeting once again, as he brought his hand up to my face and held my chin gently. On the way back to school, Freddy let me drive and neither of us said anything, but it was a comfortable silence. Once we neared the school I pulled over where I'd met Freddy earlier. \"So…\" I said awkwardly. \"So…\" Freddy said with a smiled. \"So, I guess I'll see you at your cricket game.\" I said. \"I guess so.\" He said through a small grin. \"Thank you for today.\" I said sincerely. \"And if you affect my life in no other way, you will always be the one who made me eat Stargazey Pie.\" I added. \"Hey, don't forget the fact that you liked it and had more.\" He pointed out. \"Fair point.\" I laughed. \"But honestly, thank you.\" I said and kissed him on the cheek before heading back to the school.[Chapter 6] As I walked through the school, it felt like I was floating, and when I got back to my dorm I was met with Kate, Josie, Kiki and Drippy sitting on the floor with popcorn. \"Um…hi?\" I said. \"We've got the food, now we just need every detail. Tell us exactly what happened.\" Drippy said and I grinned before flopping down onto the nearest bed. \"Best. First date. Ever.\" I said, before rolling off the bed and joining them on the floor. I told them everything in great detailed and when I told them about our kiss they went mental, as Drippy would say. \"I don't want to burst your bubble, but Harriet knows you went into town with Freddy.\" Kate said. \"Charlotte and Jane must've overheard you at the social and they told Harriet, but she couldn't know what happened because they had a prefects meeting today.\" \"Thanks for letting me know, I'll keep my head down.\" I replied. The next morning at breakfast I waited with the others for the prefects and teachers to take the head table. As Mrs Kingsley walked in, followed by Freddy I glanced over at him and he had a small smile on his face, which I returned before he joined the head table. \"Watch it. Harriet's watching.\" Drippy whispered as she nudged me and I looked over to see Harriet clenching her cereal spoon tightly in her fist, glaring at me. The rest of the week seemed to drag on but the weekend eventually arrived and the girls and I were sitting on the bus, heading to St Paul's to watch their cricket game against Kent, their main rivals. The morning was freezing and everyone was wrapped up in scarves, beanies, jackets and boots. \"I can't believe we have to sit out in this cold for four hours.\" Kiki grumbled, pulling her beany over her ears. \"And we already know who's going to win.\" Josie added. \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"St Paul's always wins. It's been that way for the last decade.\" Kate explained and she was right. By the time they'd reached the three hour mark it was five for three-hundred-and-twenty-six, which as I'd explained to Drippy meant that five batters had clocked up three-hundred-and-twenty-six runs between them and the other team hadn't even batted yet. However, by the time St Paul's was out of batters they were on six-hundred-and-seventy-one and Kent only had half an hour to catch up. I cheered with the rest of Abbey Mount as St Paul's took to the field, with Freddy as Wicket Keeper. The first out came from the bowler, who bowled the second batter out for a duck. The second came from a spectacular catch from the outfield. The player pretty much sprinted and launched himself into the air, somehow managing to catch the ball before it went over his head. The next out came from our very own Freddy. As the batter went to hit the ball, it only nicked the side of his bat, and with a mix of instinct and pure reflexes, Freddy reached out and caught it with one hand as the siren sounded. The crowd erupted into cheers as the St Paul's team tackled each other to the ground. As they slowly made their way back to the stands I waved to Freddy and gave him a thumbs up as he grinned back at me. \"Well done, boys! Excellent catch Freddy! That was simply amazing!\" I heard Harriet calling, but he either didn't hear her or chose to ignore her. As the players headed off to their change rooms, everyone started making their way back to the buses, but I decided to congratulate Freddy before heading back. So after telling my friends that I'd meet them back at the dorm, I made my way down to the change rooms. I waited around the corner for ten minutes or so, feeling a little awkward as all the players trooped past me, but Freddy wasn't with them. I decided to go and find him, so I rounded the corner and walked towards the change rooms. There were a few steps leading down to the entrance around a small corner, and when I rounded it, what I saw made my heart sink instantly. I'd found Freddy. With Harriet. Kissing her. I stood there for what felt like minutes, but was only for a few seconds before they felt someone's presence and when Freddy looked up and saw me, a look of horror spread across his face. I didn't know what else to do, but turn around and walk away. \"Charlie. Charlie!\" Freddy called after me, and caught my arm. \"I didn't kiss her. She kissed me. I came out of the change rooms and suddenly she was just there, right in front of me.\" He said as I turned around to face him. \"You do believe me, don't you?\" \"I-I don't know.\" I replied. \"I mean. I want to believe you and I'm sure you are telling the truth. But I saw you, and you didn't back away.\" \"Charlie, I'm so sorry.\" He said, looking down at his feet. \"I don't know what to say.\" \"Neither do I.\" I said, shaking my head. \"But if you want to be with Harriet, then I won't get in the way.\" I said, before leaving him in the hallway as I walked back to the buses. \"Worst week after best first date ever.\" I said miserably as I walked back into the dorm. \"What do you mean?\" Josie asked. \"I just saw Freddy kissing Harriet.\" I said glumly, sitting down on the edge of my bed. \"What?!\" the others cried in surprise. \"No way!\" Kiki said. \"Did he see you?\" Kate asked. \"Yeah, and he said that Harriet kissed him, but I was watching for a few seconds and he didn't seem to be trying to get away.\" I said. \"Well how long was it?\" Drippy asked. \"Because it takes a person three seconds, on average, to register that they're being kissed. The first second is the surprise, the next second is oh my goodness, someone's lips are on mine and then the third is like, OMG, this person is kissing me.\" \"Um, it was about…\" I said, counting on my fingers. \"five or six.\" \"Oh dear. Freddy, you're in trouble.\" Drippy said, shaking her head. \"But I don't get it. I didn't think he had any feelings for Harriet.\" I said, trying to reason with it. \"I mean, he could've just been overwhelmed by his win and wasn't thinking straight, or it could also be that Harriet knew about our trip into town and she wanted to get between us.\" \"No. You can't think like that.\" Kiki said. \"Don't make excuses for him.\" \"What are you going to do?\" Kate asked. \"Nothing.\" I replied. \"What do you mean nothing?\" Josie cried. \"You're going to make his life a misery, is what you're going to do.\" \"Thanks for the advice, but I think I'll pass.\" I said. \"Look, my advice is that if Freddy really wants to be with you, then he'll do whatever it takes to get you back.\" Kate said. \"We've all seen the way he looks at you, and if Harriet's noticed too then it must mean it's genuine for her to go and do what she did. So, don't give up on him just yet, but don't make it easy for him either.\" She finished with a smile. \"Thanks guys. You're the best.\" I said sincerely. The next morning at breakfast I stood with the others as the prefects and teachers filed in. As Freddy came in, I could see him looking at me out of the corner of my eye, but I refused to return the look, instead, I turned to Josie and struck up an interesting conversation about the dining table. I was curious to see how Harriet and he would interact, and as I ate breakfast I watched Harriet chatting away to him as he silently ate his cereal. Before the school went to their first classes, Mrs Kingsley stood up to make an announcement. \"I'd just like to make a quick announcement about our school social.\" She began and the school pricked up their ears. \"The last one at St Paul's was a wonderful success and you all conducted yourselves like the lovely, young ladies you all are. As you know, Abbey mount is to host the next one and isn't for another month. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, we are brining the date forwards to this weekend.\" She announced and loud whispers spread throughout the hall. \"Now, as it's at such short notice, we need your help in organising the night, so if I could have a group of five girls volunteer to plan the wonderful night, I would be very grateful.\" She said and looked around the room. \"Why don't we do it?\" Drippy suggested. \"Yeah, we can make it perfect and not worry about school work, boys or Harriet. Just have a wonderful night as great friends.\" Kate said and we all agreed before turning back to Mrs Kingsley, raising our hands eagerly. \"Well, thank you girls. You can choose the theme, decorations, music and snacks. Just nothing I wouldn't agree with.\" She said and I smiled back at her. This was going to be awesome.[Chapter 7] \"First of all, we need to settle on a theme.\" Kate said as the five of us sat in a circle on the floor of our dorm and I was poised and at the ready with my notebook. \"Nothing tacky.\" I said. \"Something clever and cool.\" \"What about…\" Josie said looking down at her computer screen. \"Underwater themed, hippies versus hipsters, Gatsby, classy versus trashy, round the world, come dressed as your Mum...\" she read out. \"They're all good ideas, but nothing really stands out.\" Kiki said. \"Okay, um…what about time travelers.\" Josie said. \"You can come dressed from any era.\" \"That would be easy to do the music for too.\" I said. \"Just get the ten top hits from the past five decades.\" \"I like that theme. It's fun, and the charity shop would get cleaned out in an instant,\" Drippy said. \"Fun and functional.\" I said. \"So it's settled then? Time travellers.\" Kate said. \"I'll make some flyers and stick them around the school.\" I said, pulling out my computer to design a flyer. I then spent the next hour printing off and sticking the flyers all around the school. I realized that this social had been distracting me from what had happened with Freddy. We hadn't spoken since his cricket final, and I'd reaslied what'd upset me the most wasn't so much that he and Harriet had kissed, I mean of course I was down about that, but it was more so the fact that he hadn't tried to reconcile anything and that wasn't like him. Mind you, I've only known him for six weeks, and I've never had any experience with boys before but he seemed like such a compassionate and loyal guy. But, as Kate had said, \"don't give up on him just yet\" so I wouldn't. Not yet anyway. Along with our social planning, we still had lacrosse practice that afternoon. \"Freddy and I are going to the school social together. He asked me you know.\" Harriet said loudly as she walked past me, across the field with Charlotte and Jane. I wasn't going to give her the satisfaction of seeing me annoyed. So, instead I swung the lacrosse stick and launched the ball into the goals, only barely missing Harriet's head. \"What did you have for breakfast this morning?\" Kate asked. \"You're training like a beast.\" \"I just pretended the ball was Harriet.\" I replied. \"All right, girls.\" Miss Rees-Withers said, gathering us together. \"We're playing Lady Sarah's College this weekend. I know most of you will be tired from the school social the night before, but you really need to have your game faces on. Lady Sarah's have always been the ones to knock us out of the competition, so I really need you to give it your all.\" By Thursday the school was beginning to get excited about our social, and so were we. \"But is it fluro enough?\" Drippy asked holding up a bright green, mesh t-shirt. \"If it were any more fluro, you'd need sunglasses.\" I said. The five of us were dressing in the fluro, eighties work out era, which meant, crimped hair, tights and legwarmers. Kiki and Josie had raided their mum's old wardrobe and found matching outfits in greens, yellows and purples. Drippy had a bright orange tutu, a light blue vest that said 'Chocoholic' on it and a mesh shirt over the top. We didn't need to crimp her hair but when she put on a pink sweatband; it made her look like a mushroom. Kate had this strange psycadelic tennis dress, which she pared with pink tights, white sneakers and green legwarmers. I had a sloppy white vest with the word 'Gnarley' on it, written in rainbow text and underneath it, a yellow camisole. I had a pair of bright pink shorts that went over the top of black tights. And on my feet I had a pair of white sneakers and orange legwarmers. I had blue sweatbands for my head and wrists and a rainbow scrunchiefor my hair. \"Guys, we are going to look awesome.\" I said. \"But there's just one more thing we need. Back home in Australia, at almost every dance, there's a dance-off. Everyone makes a circle and people show off their moves.\" \"The St Paul's boys always do that, but no one from Abbey Mount ever does.\" Drippy shrugged.\"Well, maybe it's time they got their asses kicked.\" Kiki said. \"What do you suggest?\" Josie asked me. \"Let's make up a hip hop routine. Only thirty seconds long or something, that will go with any song.\" I suggested. \"The St Paul's boys aren't going to know what hit them.\" Drippy said. And so for the rest of the afternoon we came up with a hip hop routine that not even Flo Rida could beat. By the time Saturday morning had arrived, everything was organized and ready, and after lunch the five of us headed down to the hall to set up all the decorations. We covered all the walls in gold streamers and decorated the music stand like an old fashioned DJ deck. The tables were covered in brightly coloured cloths and we covered the lights in cellophane so they each glowed a different colour. We'd only just finished setting up when people started arriving, so we hurried upstairs to get ready. \"Don't burn it!\" Kate squeaked as I crimped her hair.\"Sorry. It's harder than I thought it'd be.\" I replied, untangling a bit of hair from the crimper. \"Okay. Let's do it.\" I said, finishing Kate's hair and tying my own up in a scrunchie. We closed the dorm door and hurried down to the hall, where we were all hit by a proud moment; seeing our decorated hall in action and everyone was dressed up in outfits from the Gatsby era to whatever era the matching tracksuits came from. Even the teacher's had dressed up and I was surprised that most of the boys were as well. I'd have thought they'd think it was a bit uncool. When we entered the hall there was some loud seventies music being played by Mr Nellis, our very own Abbey Mount DJ who was dressed as Elvis and was chatting to Miss Rees-Withers, AKA Amy Winehouse. We made our way over to the side of the hall where Kate rushed over to her friend, or 'Boyfriend That She Keeps Telling Everyone Is Just A Friend Although No-One Believes Her.' I looked proudly around the hall and spotted a group of boys taking the time travel theme all the way back, in their pirate costumes. I didn't notice at first because of the hat, but I eventually spotted Freddy in the pirate crowd, and before one of his friends could point me out to him, I turned back to Drippy. \"So what's the goal for tonight?\" I asked her. \"Five dances and eight direct conversations, with boys that they started.\" She said, as the music suddenly scratched to halt and Charlotte and Jane hurried towards the entrance of the hall dressed in period tuxedos. Replacing the pop music was the type of music you'd hear in a movie to announce the arrival of a beautiful princess, and as Charlotte and Jane pulled open the doors, Harriet walked royaly into the hall in a long, light brown gown. She'd done her hair up in a braided beehive with little pearls throughout it. She waltzed up behind Freddy and he turned around as she spoke to him. \"Mr Darcy…\" she began and I rolled my eyes. \"What undue pleasure it is to be afforded your company.\" She continued not to be deterred by Freddy's alarmed expression. \"Keira Knightley would be horrified.\" Drippy said to me, and I snorted loudly earning a glare from Charlotte and Jane. \"Hi.\" Freddy managed feebly. \"You may only call me Mrs Darcy when you are completely, perfectly, incandescently happy.\" She finished and Drippy and I laughed as Freddy looked around the room for help. He saw at me and waited to see what I'd do, but I just raised my eyebrows at him. Harriet saw him looking at me, so grabbed his hand and pulled him into the middle of the room where some couples were already dancing. \"Love the outfits, girls.\" Miss Rees-Withers said coming over to us. \"You've done a brilliant job. It looks fantastic.\" \"Thanks Miss.\" Josie replied. The rest of the night went off without a hitch, but it wasn't until towards the end of the social that my friends and I had the best time. Kiki pointed to the dance floor as a group began to form and one of the St Paul's boys started dancing in the centre as everyone cheered him on. \"Ready girls?\" I asked. \"Yeah. Let's do it!\" they laughed and we ran over to join the crowd. We pushed through them and joined the middle as the boy busted out his best moves before waving his arms at the crowd, challenging someone to one up him. I stepped into the circle and shooed him back before spinning around starting off our dance routine. It wasn't the best dancing ever, but it had the desired affect and soon the St Paul's boy stepped forwards again with three of his friends and they began to dance back. As they danced, I walked in front of them with the others and we began our polished and well-rehearsed routine, slowly pushing the boys back into the crowd until the whole circle was ours and we'd won Abbey Mount's very first dance battle. Everyone cheered and swamped the circle and together Abbey Mount and St Paul's enjoyed the last few songs of the night.[Chapter 8] \"All right Abbey Mount! Let's start scoring!\" I yelled, trying to encourage the team. It was our lacrosse game the next morning and it was one all with only a few seconds left on the clock. The ball was tossed, caught by Lady Sarah's College and was thrown at the goal, but was caught incredibly by Kate. \"Yes, Kate!\" Miss Rees-Withers yelled from the sidelines. The ball was being prepared to be tossed again when the full-time bell rang out. \"Now what?\" I asked Drippy. \"Penalty shoot-out. Best of three.\" She replied. \"All right girls. Kiki, Charlie and Harriet will take our three shots, and girls just stay calm and keep focused.\" Miss Rees-Withers advised. \"Come on, Kate!\" we all cheered from the sidelines as the Lady Sarah's player got ready to shoot. She scooped up the ball and threw it at Kate, who blocked it with her arm pad and we all erupted into cheers. The Lady Sarah's goal keeper took her position as there was the roar of a car engine and I turned around to see Freddy jumping out of his car and coming over to watch. \"Come on Kiki! You got this!\" I cheered, turning back to the game as she threw the ball at the keeper and it flew under her arm, hitting the back of the net. \"Go Kate! You can!\" Drippy cheered as the second Lady Sarah's player threw the ball to the left, but Kate went right and the ball sailed in. \"Focus Harriet.\" Josie called to Harriet as she was about to shoot, but first made sure Freddy was watching. \"I am, thank you.\" She replied as she aimed the ball right into the keeper's glove. I shook my head as Drippy smacked her palm to her forehead. \"Go Kate! Go Kate!\" we called and cheered as she blocked Lady Sarah's last shot. It was now one all, so if I scored then we'd win, but if I didn't then it would be a draw and the referees would revert back to whoever had scored the most goals throughout the season, which wasn't us. \"Go on, Charlie! If you get this in, we win! But no pressure.\" Drippy called and I looked down at the ball in the net of my lacrosse stick. \"Come on Charlie. You've got this.\" I heard Freddy call and I looked up at the goalie. I lifted my stick and aimed high, swinging the stick through the air, but instead of letting the ball sail towards the goalies head, I let it go late and it soared low and flew right between her feet. \"Ah!\" I yelled, throwing my stick in the air as the rest of the team cheered and ran onto the field. \"Yes, girls! Now that's how you kick some ass.\" Miss Rees-Withers cried happily and then clapped her hand over her mouth, realising what she'd just said. Once the team began to troop back inside, Freddy sidled over towards Kiki and I as we chatted happily. \"Speaking of kicking ass.\" Kiki said as Freddy joined us. \"It's okay. I'll see you later, yeah?\" I said and she gave Freddy her best death stare before heading inside. \"Hi.\" He said. \"Hi.\" I replied.\"Charlie, I'm really sorry…\" he began. \"I know…\" I interrupted, not wanting to go into it now. \"Just, hang on.\" He said stopping me.\"Charlie, I'm so sorry. But I promise I didn't kiss Harriet. She came at me and I don't know why I didn't back off, I really don't. But I regret it. All of it. The kiss, not saying anything to you for the past two weeks.\" He said. \"I want you to know that it wasn't because I didn't care, that I didn't speak to you, it was because I didn't know what to say. I have so much I want to say but couldn't work out to put it so it didn't sound like I was making excuses for myself.\" He explained. \"So, in saying that. I want what we had; our friendship, our good times and our shared appreciation for Stargazey Pie…\" he said, which made me smile. \"So, I'm going to get you back. I'm still working out how, but I will…if you'll have me.\" he finished. \"Well, we'll just have to see. Won't we?\" I said. \"Watch this space.\" He said, walking backwards towards his car and drawing a square with his fingers. \"Like a hawk.\" I said seriously and narrowed my eyes at him as he grinned. That was exactly what I wanted him to say. That he was going to fight for me. He hadn't given up on us and neither had I, and I had every faith in him that he was going to get this relationship back and I was curious to see what he'd do to get it.[Chapter 9] \"Ugh. I hate mid-term exams.\" Drippy said, dropping her head onto her maths book, lying on the table in front of her. \"They're still three weeks away. We've got plenty of time.\" Josie said, putting her feet on the table, and then quickly taking them off again, after getting a disapproving look from the lurking librarian. \"Don't run out of time.\" I warned as I packed up my books. \"I'll see you back at the dorm.\" \"I thought we were studying together.\" Drippy protested. \"Drippy we've been here for an hour. You've written the title and I've written two essays.\" I pointed out gently. \"Fine.\" She huffed. \"At least leave them for us to look at.\" \"Knock yourself out.\" I replied and dropped the papers on the table before leaving the library. When I got back to the dorm, I was surprised to find a softball bat leaning up against my bed. I picked it up and let it slide through my hand as I wondered where it'd come from. I happened to glance out the window and saw Freddy sitting on a bench beside the field, re-strapping the handle of his cricket bat. I wondered if this was his doing, so I headed down to the entrance of the school and made a bee-line for him across the field. \"This you?\" I asked, holding up the bat.\"Finally. I've been waiting here for ages.\" He replied. \"Well, I was doing that amazing thing called studying. You should try it some time.\" I suggested. \"Well I was doing this.\" He replied with a grin. \"And what's 'this?'\" I asked. \"Step one for getting you to forgive me.\" he said, standing up. \"I thought you'd like to get back to your normal sport.\" He added and gestured to one of those machines that shoot balls for you to hit. \"Where did you ever get that?\" I asked. \"The school sports storeroom. They won't miss it.\" He replied. \"So…wanna have a hit?\"\"Sure. But this isn't a date.\" I said, tying back my hair. \"Wouldn't dare.\" He replied. So, after setting up the machine, I stood about five meters in front of it and waited for it to shoot the ball. When it came, it was much faster than I thought it'd be, but I swung the bat and it connected dead on, and the ball went flying for about one hundred meters. \"Nice.\" Freddy said. \"Thanks. Your turn now.\" I replied and handed the bat to him. \"Okay. Watch this.\" He said, and lifted the bat. \"Okay, first of all. That's not how you hold it.\" I said, and pushed up his back elbow so it was horizontal. \"Move your hands down to here.\" I said, and pushed his hands down towards the bottom of the bat. I glanced up at him to see him looking at me with a slight smile. \"Try that.\" I said, stepping back. \"Yes, ma'am.\" He said and swung at the ball, which went right under the bat. \"We'll call that a practice, shall we?\" I laughed. \"Try keeping your head still and watch the ball.\" I said and the next ball he hit dead on. \"Perfect.\" I chuckled, seeing his ecstatic grin. We continued on like this until there was little sun left in the sky. \"So have I earned a few brownie points?\" Freddy asked. \"Oh, I think so.\" I replied. \"I guess I'll see you around.\" It felt horrible walking away from him like this, but I had faith in him that I wouldn't have to forever.[Chapter 10] \"Shoot Harriet!\" Kate yelled from the other end of the field, and Harriet threw the ball into the opposition's goal as the full-time bell rang out. Another game done and dusted. We were now in the Semi Finals of the under-eighteen lacrosse tournament. However, my excitement was about to be shattered as Mrs Kingsley approached me after I came out of the change rooms. \"Charlie, I was wondering if I could have a word with you in my office.\" She said, and I nervously followed her in silence. I really hoped I wasn't in trouble. \"Now, Charlie, there isn't really an easy way of saying this, but I'm sure you're aware of the fact that you're school isn't the most affluent establishment.\" She began and I nodded slowly. \"Well, I received an email from the head mistress this morning and they've decided to close the school.\" She said and my eyes widened in shock. \"So, that's it. It just closed?\" I said, trying to comprehend what she was saying. \"Yes, that is correct.\" She answered. \"Unfortunately, this also means that they are no longer able to fund your stay with us, and they only enough money left to get you through the next two weeks.\" \"So, I have to…leave?\" I asked. \"Unless the money becomes available, then sadly that is what must happen.\" She said. \"Believe me Charlie I wish I could help.\" \"So, there's nothing I can do?\" I asked hopelessly. \"Well, I'm….actually, I might have an idea, but I'll have to check it over first.\" She said thoughtfully. \"I'll let you know the outcome this afternoon, but finger's crossed.\" \"Well, I hope that what ever your idea is works.\" I said. \"And, thank you.\" I finished before leaving her office and as I passed the front steps of the school, I sat down on the cold stone and rested my face in my hands. I couldn't leave now. I didn't want to leave now. Not now. What about my friends? Lacrosse? Freddy? Exams? I realised that I would've had to deal with this in five weeks time anyway, but I hadn't realised how quickly the past seven weeks had flown by. And now I'd have to go home, leaving so much incomplete and, thinking about what could've been. I was so busy thinking about my woes, that I didn't notice Freddy walking up the turning circle. \"You know you'll catch a cold if you sit out here.\" He said, walking up to me. \"I know.\" I replied glumly. \"What's the matter?\" he asked, sitting down next me. \"I have to leave in two weeks.\" I replied. \"What? I thought you were staying till the end of the term.\" He said, surprised. \"I was. Until my school back home closed because of money, and now there's only enough left to pay for two more weeks.\" I summed up. \"And I have no idea what to do, because I don't want to leave and where do I go once I get home?\" I sighed and buried my face back in my hands. I felt Freddy gingerly put his arm around my shoulder, as if worried I wouldn't like it, but at that point I didn't care, I welcomed the comfort. \"You'll work something out.\" He said, reassuringly. \"I wish I had your confidence.\" I said into my hands. \"Something will turn up. And if it doesn't, I'll think of something.\" He said and I heard the smile in his voice. \"Thanks.\" I replied and managed a small smile. That afternoon I was back in Mrs Kingsley's office to see if her idea had worked. \"Charlie, I've done some research and emailed the school board and they would be prepared to offer you a scholarship, to finish your senior school education with Abbey Mount.\" She said. \"So, I'd not just stay till the rest of the term, but until I graduate?\" I asked. \"Yes, that is the idea.\" She replied. \"Wow. That's…amazing. Thank you.\" I said. \"Well, you won't get it for nothing. Most of the scholarships here are academic, so you'd need to do very well in one of your end of term exams.\" She said and then brought up a document on her computer. \"I had a look over your past marks and geography seems to be your best subject. So, I'd aim for a scholarship for geography.\" \"What mark would I have to get?\" I asked. \"It would have to be a high distinction, so anywhere between ninety and one hundred per cent.\" She replied. \"Don't look so mortified, I have every faith that you can do it.\"\"Thank you, Mrs Kingsley.\" I said, before leaving her office. On my way back up to my dorm I passed Harriet in the hallway, with Charlotte and Jane trailing behind her. \"I heard you'll sadly be leaving us soon.\" Harriet said as she walked past me, but ignored her. \"You can go back to Boganville where you belong.\" \"You seem pretty eager for me to leave.\" I replied, stopping and turning around to face her. \"You're powers of observation are exemplary.\" She scoffed, rolling her eyes. \"Well, in that case you won't be happy to hear that I intend on staying at Abbey Mount until I graduate.\" I said matter of factly. \"I intend to apply for a Geography Scholariship.\" \"And you really think you'll get it?\" she asked scornfully. \"Actually, yes. I will, because I have this wonderful thing called a brain. Something which you seem to be lacking in.\" I replied smoothly as I turned away from her and continued on to my dorm. After explaining the plan with my friends, I settled down to begin what was going to be one of many long days of studying Coastal Management and the four spheres.[Chapter 11] The week before exams started flew by and in no time at all I was waiting outside the exam room with my peers. Now, I never did nerves well and this morning was no exception. I had my teeth clenched together and all I was concentrating on was the sick feeling in my stomach. \"Would you relax? You're making us all nervous.\" Kate said beside me. \"Do you think there's enough time to go to the bathroom?\" I asked, more importantly. \"Nope.\" She replied and nodded to the entrance of the room where the examiners had started filing people in. I groaned and followed the others inside and waited for the exam to begin. \"You may start.\" The examiner said once everyone had settled. I opened the booklet and went straight to the essay section. The question read: 'Examine the effects that either Coastal Management or Deforestation has had on their individual environments, and discuss how the spheres interact with each other in these zones.' A wave of relief washed over me as I began writing about my Coastal Management strategies, which had been one of the only things I'd been reading about for the past two weeks. The two hour exams went in a heartbeat, but by the time we put down our pens I was happy with what I'd written. Although some of the multiple choices were a little sketchy, I was confident that I had every chance of getting a high distinction. \"So, how'd you go?\" Kate asked as we left the room. \"Pretty good I think.\" I admitted. \"How about you?\" \"Eh, alright, I think.\" She shrugged. \"Do you know when you'll find out about what you got?\" \"Mrs Kingsley said she'll know by the end of the week.\" I answered. \"It's cutting it close though. I find out on Friday and then I have a week to finalise whatever happens.\" \"Well, whatever happens, we'll look out for you.\" She said. \"Thank you, Kate, and I hope you guys know that I'd do anything for you, and I'm very grateful to have you as my friends.\" I smiled, looping my arm through hers. The few days leading up to finding out my results were the definition of torture. Every day seemed to drag on and when the day finally arrived I headed for Mrs Kingsley's office first thing in the morning. As I was approaching her office, the door opened and Freddy walked out. \"The moment of truth?\" he asked. \"Yep.\" I replied with a nervous smile. \"Don't worry. There's no way that you can't get it.\" he said, reassuringly. \"Anyway, I'll wait here. I want to here the exciting news.\" \"You don't have to wait. It's fine.\" I replied. \"I've got nothing better to do.\" He said, making him self comfortable on the chair opposite Mrs Kingsley's office. I grinned and shook my head but said no more as Freddy gave me a thumbs up. I knocked on the door and Mrs Kinglsey called me in. \"Ah, Charlie. Good morning.\" She said. \"Morning, Mrs Kingsley.\" I replied sitting down in front of her desk. \"Have you heard from the school board?\" \"Yes, I have.\" She said and placed my exam paper on the table. \"Charlie, I'm very sorry, but you didn't score high enough to get the scholarship. A Credit is very amiable, but you needed a High Distinction.\" \"Oh.\" Was all I could manage, as I sat there in shock. How? I was sure I'd done better than that. \"Charlie. I am truly sorry, but there's nothing more that can be done.\" She said sadly and handed me my exam. \"Thank you.\" I said quietly and got up. I was about to open the door when I remembered that Freddy was sitting expectantly outside. So, I put on a brave smile and opened the door. \"So?\" Was the first thing he said. \"You got it right?\" I opened my mouth to reply but I didn't know what to say. I looked down at the floor as tears began to prick my eyes. \"I didn't get it.\" I said quietly. \"Not even close.\" I said, looking back at him as a tear escaped my eye. \"Oh, Charlie. I'm so sorry.\" Freddy said pulled me into a hug, and I rested my head against his shoulder. I opened the door to my dorm and I didn't need to say anything for my friends to know what had happened. I dropped my exam into the waste paper bin and sat, miserably on the end of my bed. \"We were so sure you'd get it, Charlie.\" Drippy said, sitting next to me and putting her arm around my shoulders as Kiki pulled my paper out of the bin. \"Have you looked at it?\" she asked, referring to my exam and I shook my head. \"Oh, Charlie, I thought you were going to write about Coastal Management.\" She sighed. \"I did.\" I replied. What was she talking about? \"No. You wrote about Deforestation. You've got a four page essay on it here.\" She replied. \"What?!\" I cried, getting up to look over her shoulder. \"I didn't write this.\" I said, and took the booklet from her, flipping back to some short answer questions. \"This isn't my handwriting.\" I cried, comparing the two different styles. \"Look. The corner's been re-stapled.\" Josie added as she joined us, pointing at the top left hand corner. \"This is someone else's essay.\" I said. \"But how could it be. Yours is the only one they got back.\" Drippy said. \"What if someone tampered with it?\" Kate suggested. \"They removed your essay and replaced it with a fake, poorly written.\" \"I don't know. It sounds a bit extreme.\" I said. \"I mean, why would they?\" \"I don't know.\" She replied. \"But there's something weird going on here.\"[Chapter 12] It had been two days since I'd found out I hadn't won the scholarship and I was due to leave today, but Mrs Kingsley had been kind enough to give me an extra week, so I could change plane tickets, organise my things and prepare to say goodbye to everyone. I stopped outside the assembly hall where there was a noticeboard, which displayed all the notices and messages for students about the upcoming week. The only one of any interest to me was about the lacrosse semi final this weekend. It had listed all the player's names and their positions, but it wasn't any of that which caught my attention. It was the handwriting. It was exactly the same style as that mysterious essay was written in, and signed at the bottom of the page was: ' Under 18's Lacrosse Team Captain Harriet Bentley' This time she'd taken it too far. I ripped the notice off the board and marched up to the dorm, where I grabbed my exam and compared the two styles of writing. They were exactly the same, even how the a's had a small flick on the end where the line hung over the body of the letter. I grabbed the two pieces of evidence and stormed up the stairs to Mrs Kingsley's office. I knocked impatiently on the door and opened it as I heard her call out. \"Charlie. What can I do for you?\" she asked as I marched over to her desk. I flipped my exam over to the essay and put it on the desk in front of her. \"This isn't my essay.\" I said loudly. \"Charlie, I'm only sitting a meter a way from you.\" She pointed out, but still picked up the exam. \"I wrote about Coastal Management, this one is on Deforestation and the handwriting is different.\" I continued, and then put the lacrosse notice next to the essay. \"It's Harriet's handwriting.\" I finished and sat down. \"This is a very serious accusation you're making.\" Mrs Kingsley said, looking closely at both documents. \"But they're written in exactly the same handwriting, and it's even signed by Harriet.\" I urged. \"Listen, even if what you're saying is true the scholarships have already been handed out.\" Mrs Kingsley said, placing the papers down gently on her desk. \"But, that's not fair!\" I cried. \"Charlie, please.\" She sighed. \"I will talk to your geography teacher. He knows how you write and should know your preferred topics to write about. I'll also talk to Harriet, and if your accusations are correct then she'll be suspended. \" \"But I can't stay.\" I finished for her. \"Well, I wouldn't be too quick to give up.\" She replied and I pricked up my ears. \"Just before you burst into my office I received an email, which was sent to the whole school, and attached is a rather lovely invitation to a school fete on Sunday, to raise money for a scholarship for you.\" \"What?\" I asked confused as she turned her screen towards me and I saw a flyer for a school carnival with stalls and rides. \"It seems you've made some wonderful friends here at Abbey Mount, Charlie and they don't want to see you go either.\" She smiled and I did too but then realised that I couldn't take it. \"I can't take other people's money like that. I can't accept charity. It's not like I'm living in poverty, or I'm suffering from some terrible illness.\" I said. \"Yes, that is true. But I believe people your age would still attend these types of things even if the money was only going to the school. So, having a honourable cause would only encourage them.\" She replied. She had a point. I remembered my school used to hold school carnivals to raise money for a new library or new classrooms. \"What would the scholarship be for anyway?\" I asked. \"Well it says here, in a separate email to me, that it's for Service to the School Community.\" She said. \"Wow. I can't believe people would actually do that for me.\" I said, more so to myself, than to anyone else. \"I think you've made a bigger impact on the school than you think you have.\" Mrs Kingsley said. \"You certainly have a wonderful group of friends.\" \"There's no doubt about that.\" I smiled. After I bid her farewell, I left Mrs Kingsley's office and found my friends out on the field, trooping back up to the school after their lacrosse training. I ran down the stairs and met them halfway. \"You guys are the best!\" I squealed and pulled them all into a hug. \"I take it she found out about the fete.\" Josie laughed. \"I can't believe you'd do this for me.\" I grinned. \"I'm glad you have so much faith in us.\" Drippy said sarcastically. \"I told you that whatever happens, we'd look out for you.\" Kate reminded me. \"I promise that I will repay you guys.\" I said. \"Excellent. Well, you can start by getting us into the lacrosse grand final on Saturday.\" Kiki said. \"No. We will get us into the lacrosse final.\" I replied. \"Let's do it!\" Kiki cried, raising her lacrosse stick into the air triumphantly.[Chapter 13] \"Drippy!\" I yelled and tossed the ball to her. It was semi finals time and we were leading by two. \"Shoot Drippy!\" Kiki yelled beside me. \"Stop yelling at me!\" Drippy screamed as she threw the ball and it soared past the goalies head and into the goal as the final bell rang out. \"We're in the grand final!\" Josie cheered…but whether I'd be there for it was another question. The field was cleared quicker than usual as the stalls and rides had to be set up, and by the time the sun rose the next morning everything was ready to go. The girls and I were up early that day. I felt a little awkward having this whole fete just for me, so I wanted to help in any way I could. So, since I hadn't been to any classes this past week I'd been busy baking for a cake sale, and I spent the next few hours ferrying cakes and rolls from the kitchen to the stall. As I walked back towards the kitchens for about the seventeenth time, I passed Harriet with Mrs Kingsley walking briskly towards her office. I didn't make eye contact with either of them, but I could feel Harriet's eyes boring into me. I made a few more bakery trips before girls started flooding onto the field, and I even saw groups of boys from St Paul's coming down the road to join in. As the day began, Kate, Josie, Kiki and I realised that it may have been a mistake getting Drippy to help us with the cake stall. \"Drippy! Will you stop eating the cakes!\" Kate cried. \"What?! No one's bought that many.\" She replied, quickly putting a cake down, which she thought we hadn't seen her eyeing. \"Because you've eaten most of them.\" I exaggerated. \"It's only been half an hour.\" I added with a laugh. \"I'll tell you what. Whatever's left over, you're welcome to it.\" \"And that doesn't mean you can hide some for later.\" Josie added. \"Fine.\" Drippy replied, grumpily but it was soon replaced with a laugh. \"You know, I saw Harriet being walked towards Mrs Kinglsey's office earlier.\" I said. \"Ooh.\" Kiki cooed. \"I wonder if she'll get expelled.\" \"Mrs Kingsley said she'd get a suspension.\" I replied. \"Serves her right.\" Kate said. \"By the way, is anyone going to put their names down to be a prefect next year?\" she asked. \"May as well.\" Josie said and Kiki agreed. \"I bet you'll get Head Girl, Kate.\" Drippy said. \"Oh, I don't know.\" Kate replied sheepishly. \"How does it work?\" I asked. \"People put their names in for prefect and the whole school, plus teachers vote for them, and the two prefects who get the most votes are named Head Girl and Deputy Head Girl.\" Drippy answered. \"I think we should all put our names forward. It'd be kind of fun.\" Josie said and we all agreed. For the next few hours, four of us worked hard selling cakes and slices, while the fifth one taste tested them. \"Man, how do I choose.\" I heard a familiar voice say and we looked up to see Freddy looking down at the cakes with his mother beside him. \"These look wonderful.\" Mrs Kingsley added. \"I don't know which to get the healthier carrot cake, or that scrumptious looking mud cake.\" \"How about both, then the mud cake can balance out the healthier carrot cake and you can call it a balanced meal.\" I suggested and the pair laughed. \"Alright. Why not?\" she decided. \"I'll be back soon, darling.\" She said to Freddy as she wandered over to another stall after Kate handed her the cakes. \"We just can't seem to get rid of you can we?\" Freddy said to me. \"A Credit is a perfectly respectable mark and besides that wasn't my fault.\" I replied. \"I heard. Apparently Harriet's gone to face the school's board.\" He said. \"Still keeping up with your girlfriend I see.\" I teased and a pained expression crossed his face. \"I'm joking. Have a cake.\" \"Only you would make a stinging remark and then tell someone to heal it with cake.\" He said with a smirk. \"Cake fixes everything. Right Drippy?\" I said. \"Of course.\" She replied as if it was a stupid question to ask. \"Right.\" Freddy said, rolling his eyes. \"I'll see you later, yeah?\" \"See ya.\" I replied and he left with his cake. The rest of the day was a wonderful success and I decided that even if we didn't raise enough money, I'd be leaving Abbey Mount on a high. \"How much did we make?\" Kate asked Mrs Kingsley as we sat with Miss Rees-Withers and Mr Nellis as they counted the money. Miss Rees-Withers plugged a final number into the calculator and then handed it to Mrs Kingsley. \"Did we make enough?\" Josie asked. \"With plenty to spare.\" Mrs Kingsley smiled, and I couldn't keep the yell in as it escaped my lips. The others whooped and cheered as well. \"Girls, really.\" Mrs Kingsley said, covering her ears. \"Sorry, Mrs Kingsley.\" We laughed. \"Thank you so much.\" I added and she smiled before dismissing us. Once outside her office I wrapped my four friends into a huge hug. \"I can't thank you guys enough. I have no words to describe how grateful I am.\" I said honestly. \"Well, actually it wasn't our idea.\" Kate admitted. \"What?\" I asked surprised. \"Sure, we helped. But it was actually Freddy's idea. He organised it all, we just helped.\" Drippy said. \"Really?\" I asked quietly. \"Yeah. And if that doesn't earn him a few points, then I don't know what will.\" Kiki said. \"Wow. Well, thank you guys, honestly.\" I said. \"I'll meet you back at the dorm. There's something I have to do.\" I smiled, before leaving them and hurrying down into the garden to see if Freddy was out there, and sure enough, there he was, getting into his car. \"Hey! Wait up! Freddy. I can stay!\" I called excitedly, as I ran over to the road and he got out his car as I reached him. \"That's amazing!\" He said happily with a grin on his face. \"But why didn't you tell me?\" I asked. \"Tell you what?\" he replied, leaning on the side of the car. \"About this.\" I said, gesturing to the field, as the last of the stalls were being packed away. \"This was all your idea? Why didn't you tell me?\" \"I don't know. I thought a surprise would be better. And I knew you'd feel like you were being a burden if you found out before hand.\" He shrugged, and I understood what he meant even if it sounded a bit confusing coming out of his mouth. He was right, guessing that I felt like I was being a burden on people. I mean, my friends had finished their exams, so they had the time, but Freddy was in the middle of his, and if I'd known it was his idea, I wouldn't of let him go through with it. \"Freddy, I don't know how to thank you enough.\" I said sincerely. \"Honestly, what you've done is just, amazing.\" I decided. \"Well, hopefully I've earned a few more brownie points.\" He smiled and I couldn't believe how humble he was. I sighed in amazement before stepping forward and pressing my lips against his. \"Does that answer your question?\" I asked with a smile as I backed away slightly. \"It's a start.\" He grinned and I laughed before kissing him again. I leant against him as I held his face in my hands. Unfortunately, I started smiling, which made him smile too and we ruined our kiss by bursting out into laughter.[Chapter 14] \"I can't believe there are only two weeks of school left.\" Drippy said at breakfast. \"Thank goodness.\" Josie said, pushing her egg around the plate. \"Then one more year and school will officially be over.\" Kiki added and everyone was quiet as we all thought this over. \"This is making me feel depressed. Let's think about something happy.\" I said. \"Yes! Like the ball coming up, and our Grand Final.\" Kate said. \"At least we don't have to go shopping for dresses or anything.\" I added. \"This was the only social thing I knew would be happening at Abbey Mount, so I can finally use my own clothes. When is it anyway?\" \"It's next Thursday. Then we have the grand final on Saturday and our final day of school's on Wednesday.\" Kiki listed. \"By the way. Don't forget to put your names down for prefects today.\" Kate said as we got up from the breakfast table. \"Let's just do it now.\" I suggested as we headed for the hall entrance and I flashed a smile at Freddy as I passed behind him. After the five of us signed our names on the prefect list we headed off for one of our last days of classes. Maths came and went, then English, Geography, Health and Food Technology. And then as fast as the lessons went, so did the days and in the blink of an eye it was Thursday and my friends and I were getting ready to head down into the hall where all the boys from St Paul's were waiting. Being England, everything was done the proper way and I loved it. \"So, has anyone got any dances lined up already for tonight?\" Kiki asked, as she pulled the zip up on the side of her mermaid style, maroon dress. \"We all know someone has.\" Drippy said, casting an innocent, sideways glance at me and I rolled my eyes back at her as I pulled out my dress from the cupboard. \"Ooh, that's lovely.\" Said Kate as she pulled on a pair of heels. \"Thanks.\" I said. It had been a birthday present from my three brothers, and it must have cost a small fortune, but for three twenty year old boys, they had good taste. It was a blue, short sleeve organza ball gown with a crystal, beaded bodice, and had high neckline. The organza skirt shimmered wherever the light hit it and the bodice was cut away at the back. I was completely in love with it. \"Guys! It's almost seven o'clock.\" Josie cried. \"Hurry up!\" I quickly pulled on my dress and a pair of black heels, fixed my hair into loose waves and put on some subtle make-up. By the time we were ready it was quarter-past-seven and we checked ourselves in the mirror one more time before we made our way down to the hall. Everyone, including all the girls from Abbey Mount were already inside when we arrived at the entrance. I queued up at the back of the line to show the teachers out tickets and to give them our bags, and soon, I was the only one left outside the hall. \"Thanks, Miss Rees-Withers.\" I said to our lacrosse coach as she handed me back my ticket. \"My pleasure. You go have fun now.\" She replied and as I walked over to the entrance, my stomach did a flip. I suddenly felt very nervous and awkward. I didn't want to go in on my own, it's embarrassing. I know I was just being silly, but suddenly the English tradition of a grand entrance didn't seem that appealing anymore. I poked my head around the door and saw everyone talking and laughing. I thought I'd take my chance while they were all distracted to sneak in and find Kate. I was about to sneak down the stairs when Miss Rees-Withers flew past and clattered down the stairs, making everyone stop and stare. I saw that a few people had seen me peeking like some kind of weirdo, so I swallowed my pride and stepped out from behind the door. A few people went back to talking but most of the room continued to stare and I wished that I could melt into the ground. 'This is so awkward.' I thought to myself as I carefully made my way down the steps. Someone pushed through the crowd in front of me, and I felt a little more at ease as Freddy appeared in front of me. \"Hi.\" I said awkwardly. \"Uh, hi…\" he managed. \"Are you okay?\" I asked. \"Uh…yeah.\" He replied. \"You, um…wow…\" he stammered and I tried to stop myself laughing. \"…You look, beautiful.\" He finally managed, sticking his hands into the pockets of his navy suit, which he'd paired with a white shirt and black shoes. \"Thanks. And you look hot…or handsome, of whatever…\" I said, just as awkwardly. \"At least I now know I'm not the only one feeling awkward.\" He grinned, but as the night went on I soon settled into the swing of things and was having a great time. \"I can't believe another school year is almost over.\" Freddy said as we danced. \"Are you doing anything in the holidays?\" \"I'm going back home, but I actually had an idea about that.\" I said. \"And that is?\" he asked. \"That's for me to know and you to find out.\" I smiled as I let go of his hand and put my arms around his neck. \"When will I find out?\" he smirked, wrapping his arms around my waist. \"Well if I tell you then it'll be less of a surprise then, won't it?\" I said. \"But I'll give you a hint. It has something to do with the beach.\" \"Fine. Let's make a deal, I'll stop asking, if you promise me, that I'll get an awesome tan out of whatever it is you've got planned.\" He said. \"Deal.\" I laughed and he smiled as he leant down to kiss me. As our lips met, he held me close as I sunk my fingers into his hair, enjoying every moment. Once we parted, I rested my head on his shoulder and looked over at my friends who were all dancing as well. What a perfect way to end the school year.[Chapter 15] \"Well, another school year has come to an end and every girl in this room should be proud of everything they've accomplished over the last twelve months.\" Mrs Kingsley said in the final assembly. \"This weekend is the Grand Final of the under 18's lacrosse tournament and everyone is expected to attend to support our peers.\" She said and there were a few collective groans. \"Kara, I take it you'll be leading the cheerers.\" She said to one of the groaners. \"Now, before we conclude our final assembly, it's time to announce the prefects and head girl for next year.\" She said and the hall sat up and listened intensely. \"If your name is called out, please come up the front. Our prefects for 2010 are, Lily Nicholson, Alison Wai, Clara Kaplan, Jennifer Logan, Kiki Wu, Josie Cocker and Charlotte Moss.\" Mrs Kingsley announced and I clapped along as the girls, including, Drippy, Kiki and Josie, stood in front of the hall. I glanced over at Kate who looked disappointed. I patted her on the shoulder and she gave me a shrug of defeat. \"And finally, our Deputy Head Girl and Head Girl.\" Mrs Kingsley continued. \"Our Deputy Head Girl for 2010 is, Charlie Webster.\" She announced as the hall clapped. \"What?!\" I said to myself as I sat in total shock. \"Go!\" Kate said and shoved me out of my seat and I wandered up to the front of the room in amazement as Mrs Kingsley beamed at me and my friends grinned. \"And our Head Girl is…Kate Nixon.\" She announced and the hall erupted into cheers and applause. If my face had been a picture of shock, then Kate's was one of utter disbelief. \"Close your mouth.\" I whispered to her as she stumbled up to the front of the room, and she closed her gape. \"Abbey Mount, these are your prefects and leaders for 2010.\" Mrs Kingsley said and the hall cheered. The next two days dragged on as our grand final edged closer. I'd found out that Freddy had been named Head Boy at St Paul's and Kiki had named us 2010s power couple. When Sunday finally arrived everyone was ready and determined to end their year on a high, and our opponents Mercury Girls College had the same mindset. \"Come on girls. Let's kick some ass!\" I cried as we ran onto the field. The team was positively glowing with energy and determination, and it showed in our playing. The score was three – two to Abbey Mount. \"You're playing brilliantly ladies. If you keep playing at this pace we've got a good chance of winning this thing.\" Miss Rees-Withers said excitedly. We ran back onto the field, and Mercury College must have gotten some serious pep talk, because it felt like we were playing a new team. In ten minutes they'd evened the scores and were now leading by one. When there were two minutes to go, no one had scored and Mercury College had possession of the ball. They ran towards Kate in the goals, dodging between Kiki and Drippy. The girl with the ball went to shoot, but out of nowhere, Josie's stick appeared, catching the ball before it even reached Kate. \"Yes Josie!\" Kiki screamed and caught the ball as Josie threw it over the heads of the girls from Mercury College. Kiki dodged between players as I made my way over to the opposite goals. \"Kiki! I'm open!\" I yelled and she didn't hesitate before throwing it to me. However, it was too high. I jumped and the ball hit the top of my stick, bouncing high, over my head. I whirled around and stretched out my stick, reached as far as I could and somehow, the ball dropped into the net. \"Shoot!\" I heard Kate scream from the other side of the field and I glanced at the clock. Two seconds. I swung around and desperately threw the ball towards the goal. The goalie reached for it and it just skimmed the top of her pad before the ball hit the back of the net. We didn't even hear the bell, we screamed so loudly. Drippy ran at me and knocked me to the ground in a tackle. The rest of the team then piled on top in the muddy grass. The referee somehow, squeezed into the crowd to hand us the trophy and we raised it above our heads in victory. Much to the Abbey Mount girls' delight, the St Pauls boys rushed the field to celebrate. Someone ran up behind me and lifted me off the ground, spinning me in circles. When they put me down, I turned to see Freddy grinning at me. \"Come on, girls!\" Kate cried, and dragged the team off towards the pool. Drippy grabbed my hand and pulled me away. \"What are we doing?\" I cried. \"It's tradition. If we ever win an inter-school competition, we jump in the pool.\" She replied. \"And when was the last time that happened?\" I asked. \"Never. I just made it up.\" She laughed as the gate was wrenched open to the outdoor pool and the team dived in, in full lacrosse uniform. I barely had time to put down the trophy before Drippy dragged me into the cold water behind her as the crowd laughed and cheered. \"Oh, it's freezing!\" I gasped. \"Well it is the middle of winter, dummy.\" Kiki laughed. Mrs Kinglsey hid her disapproval for a few minutes, but she soon decided that that was enough and we were all ordered out of the pool. Something about being role models for the younger year groups. I went to climb out of the water and a hand was extended to me. I looked up to see Freddy shaking his head in amusement. I took it and he pulled me out, my uniform dripping on the concrete edge of the pool. He wrapped a towel around my shoulders and grinned. \"You're mad.\" He laughed. \"Only a little.\" I beamed as he put an arm around my shoulder. \"Besides it's the holidays.\" \"That's right. You promised me a tan.\" He remembered. \"And I shall deliver on that promise.\" I said. And sure enough, three weeks later Freddy, Drippy, Kate, Kiki, Josie and I leaning eagerly against the railing on the promenade overlooking Bondi Beach. \"Welcome to my home.\" I beamed, looking out over the bright sand and crystal clear water. \"Come on girls! Let's hit the beach!\" Drippy cried, and we ran down onto the hot sand.[Chapter 16] 30 Years Later \"Come on, Lucy. Your hair looks fine.\" I said to the thirteen-year-old girl in the back of our car. \"Alright. Alright. I just need another hairclip.\" She replied as I saw Freddy coming down the road from St Paul's to Abbey Mount. I got out of the car to meet him. \"How'd he go?\" I asked. \"Fine. Jack found his friends and then left me in the hallway.\" He replied, a little forlornly. \"You know he'll call tonight. He'll miss his Dad, believe me.\" I smiled. \"Charlie!\" An excited voice squealed and I whirled around to see Drippy and Kate running towards me. \"Hi!\" I laughed as they launched into a hug. \"Are your girls already inside?\" Freddy asked my two friends. \"Kate's is, of course. Perfect uniform and all.\" Drippy teased. \"I'm still trying to get mine out of the car.\" She finished and I looked to a few cars down, where two twin girls with big, fluffy blonde hair sat arguing in the back seats. It wasn't long before Josie and Kiki bounded up, their respective daughters talking with Kate's eldest. \"It feels like only yesterday it was our first day.\" Kiki said nostalgically. \"There's my favourite son!\" A shrill voice came from the front steps and Mrs Kingsley, still Headmistress, came bounding down the steps, which was quite remarkable for her age. \"I'm your only son, Mum.\" Freddy grinned, hugging his mother. \"That you are. And I also only have one granddaughter.\" She added, rapping sharply on Lucy's window. \"Come on, young lady. You don't want to be last in on your first day.\" She said. Lucy pulled one more piece of hair behind her ear and climbed out of the car. She had my brown hair, but Freddy's piercing blue eyes. We said goodbye to our daughter and the six of us watched as our children walked into the hall of the same school where our friendships and adventures had begun all those years ago.

Be nice... Anyways... Disclaimer:. IOWNADVDBUTNOTTHEMOVIE:(( Chapter 1- Invitations PPOV (Poppy's) I sat their and stared at my ring in what seemed like hours. Five years it has been, five years of a blissful marriage. It was a day full of love, the day I married my one and true love, Freddie Kingsley. We met in Abbey Mount, a place I once loathed. I just wanted to get kicked out but later on my plans changed and we sort of snapped. The same year my father sent me to that school for my attitude. He was right, it did change my life. I appreciate him for that. Nobody knew about our marriage in Abbey Mount, only Freddie's mother knew about us. I'm so happy that she accepted our love. They still think that I broke up with Freddy. Nope, I still love him, my love for him never changed. We dated for about five years and we've decided that we were meant for each other. He was the one for me and I was the one for him. None months after the wedding I gave birth to our first born, a boy, we named him Edward. He got is father's looks and I loved him nevertheless. From the moment I saw him I knew that the girl destined for him is a lucky girl. When I thought nothing could get any better, I started feeling a little bit nauseous and started vomitting. It started a few weeks ago. I later missed my period and immediately went to the doctor's. They confirmed that I was a little bit near 3 months in my pregnancy. So today I was gonna tell them. During the first pregnancy, Freddie and I found out the same time, but now here I was afraid of what my son's reaction is this time. Now, I was alone in our house because Freddie thinks I need to relax a little bit and they went to watch a soccer game. Those were my boys. They loved sports. They said they'll be back by 5, so they'll be here any minute. \"Mommy! We're here!\" Edward shouted. Man, he even sounds like his father [AN: Yummy, the English accent...HMMMM...] . \"I'll be there in a minute!\" I replied. As I changed. I think some things will never change. FPOV [Freddie] \"Edward , don't run you might fall,\" I told my 4-year-old son, Edwatd. He was so much like his mother. He acts the way his mother, so stubborn. That's why I loved her. She was my skies. I loved every little bit of her. When I'm around her it's like the whole world doesn't matter. \"Mommy! We're here!\" He shouted to Poppy. \"I'll be there in a minute!\" She shouted back. \"Edward, go to the dining hall, I'm just checking something,\" I said to him and he went straightly to the dining hall. I went out to check the mailbox. I checked it everyday. Being a lawyer was no easy job, you get to have cases everyday. I checked it one by one- case, case, bill and one particular envelope that caught me offguard. It was a letter from Abbey Mount. I think this is for Poppy. I hid it under my coat so I could surprise her later on. I ran to the dining hall only to see that Poppy and Edward were already seated on their places. I sat on mine and we said our thanksgiving. As we were eating, I tried to make conversation with Poppy. \"So, do you still have connections to Kiki, Kate, Drippy and Jossie?\" I asked her. \"Actually, when we went to college here in America, I've never heard from then since then,\" she said truthfully. \"Wow, I thought they knew about us getting married and having Edward,\" I told her. Edward looked at us and asked,\"who are those, daddy? And why did you say my name?\" He asked. \"They're just some old friends of mommy,\" said Poppy. Edward continued eating but nevertheless kept listening to us. He was a smart guy, he'll never stop asking not unless we answer him back. I started getting the letter out of my pocket when Poppy asked, \"so, how was work?\" \"It was okay, won another case.\" I told her smiling. \"Good, with that Mr. Bentley guy?\" She asked, \"Yeah, I just found a loophole,\" I said, smiling. \"Oh, honey, good job for you!\" She told me going. She's always so caring. I got the letter out before she could get to another topic and I showed it llike it was a paycheck. She widened her eyes. \"NOWAY! OH MY GOSH!\" She said, surprise wasn't hidden in her face. She was rather shocked. \"GIVE ME THAT,\" she repeated as she went near me. I just stood up and extended my arms upward. Edward was laughing he loved it when Poppy and I act like kids. Some things never did change for the two of us. I shuckled softly while she was trying to get the letter. \"FREDDIE KINGSLEY! Give me that paper!\" She's been lightheaded these past few days for some reason. I think it's that fever she has. She's been acting strangely. I gave it to her and we read it together. It stated: Dear Poppy Moore, It has been eight years since you graduated the Abbey Mount Boarding School. Eight years have passed since you got to know your friends. Now, it's time to get to know them again, in a reunion party. It's going to be in the Abbey Mount halls. The same place where we had a dress ball [ Remember the party where Harriet waas Kierra Knightly? Yeah, that's the place]. It will be on February 15, 2020. sincerely, Cherry Abbott Abbey Mount Head Master I remember the first time Poppy and I met, I was taking a deep in my bath tub when she walked in unsuspectingly. I chuckled softly. I remembered those exact words I used. \"Well, Moore Poppy Moore,\" I recalled. I never did regret not giving her a second chance. It was the second best thing I have ever done. When I looked at Edward, he seemed to look confused and tired. PPOV: I was supposed to ask who this Cherry was but I heard him laugh. He was recalling the past. When he looked up, I asked him,\" Who is this Cherry Abbott?\" I asked my husband. He said \"Matron,\" he replied. I remember the first time I saw her. I gave her all the wet clothers for washing and even gave her a hindred dollars to buy herself some new clothes. I started to chuckle but Freddie nudged me and that made me look up. \"Looks like someone is ought to go to bed,\" I said. Freddie carried him up to his room and I gave him a bath. I let him change into his pyjamas before we tucked him in while Freddie picked a book for him to read. This time it was about the \"Three Little Pigs.\" He read it to Edward and Edward fell asleep. He stood up and stared at Edward. I went back to our room while I let him stare at our son. FPOV: If this was just a dream I wouldn't want to wake up and since it's reality I never want to sleep. When Edward was born I promised that I would never miss an event in his life. I would be there for the first day of school and the first time he gets a girl and even be there for him when he gets married. I also promised myself the one thing I never got, a sibling. I was an only child. The premature death of my father was the main reason. He died when I was young. It was an accident that took him away from me and my mom. I never want him to experience the same loneliness I have experienced before. Tonight, I would urge Poppy to try for a baby once again. I went back to our room and once I got to the door I started with a,\"Hey Mrs. Kingsley,\" as I enetered the room smiling seductively. She was already in bed reading a book. She saw me and I laughed. I started to take my top off and once I got in bed she went near me. We kissed passionately. In between kisses I told her that,\"Poppy, don't you think Edward needs something?\" She replied, \"He has a lot of toys to play with and a lot of stuff, what else does he need?\" She asked. \"Something that I never had,\" I told her. I tried to remove her night gown. \"I don't think we have to wait for lng though,\" she told me with the happiness found in her eyes. \"When did you find out?\" I asked her. \"Yesterday,\" She told me. I carried her. This was the best news I've ever heard. Edward was going to be a big brother! He was going to have a little sister or brother. I kissed her passionately. \"How far along are you?\" I asked her. \"Almost three months,\" she answered. \"Are we still going to the reunion?\" I asked her. \"Of course, I just need to get an approval from my doctor to travel, besides we're only going to stay there for two weeks and we're getting Edward too,\" she told me. AN: BE NICE IT'S MY FIRST FANFICTION!!! No nasty comments.[Chapter 2] Author's Note: Sorry, ain't the chapter you have been 'spectin' just a plain author's note. Anyways, I just wanted to tell you that... I think I am not gonna be able to update this story for more or less than one or two weeks. It's our monthly exams and I still have practices for my role in a play. I've got a lot of extra-curricular activities when it comes to this time of the school year. But I do know this one. The nest chapter is something to look forward to. THIS STORY IS NOT ON HIATUS. I've finished chapter 2 and is now starting for chapter 3!!!:) I'll upload everything that I have done after my activities. Or if I have a time.:) Sincerely, in-love-with-my-own-sins Okay, so I haven't opened my that much for the past few days but I promise you after tomorrow I'll be able to type and upload two chapters. I'm soooo sorry for the long wait but I've had exams and trust me I was almost banned from using this cause I almost got a failing score...:(([Chapter 3] Author's Note; I'm sorry for that LONG leave. I had a lot of things to clarify. And I had to wait for my test results. As it turns out, I need to retake a test... And so now... what I've been wanting to upload. The ever most wonderful second chapter... Disclaimer: I do not own anything. I have to get over that fact:((... Now on with the story... CHAPTER 2- Big Brother?! PPOV: Freddie wanted a sibling all his life. It's something that he could never get and something he wanted his son to have. His father died when he was three and since then he's lost all hope ro have a sibling. He didn't want for Edward to be lonely, he even asked to start trying. He twirled me around the room and we kissed passionately, like it was our first kiss. FPOV: \"We need to tell him, you know?\" I told Poppy. \"I know,\" Poppy said, nervously. \"But wh-what i-i-if he doesn't want a sibling? Wh-wh-what if-\" I cut her off with my finger. \"I'm sure he'll be as excited as if he's getting a new toy that everybody is yet to get,\" I told her reassuringly. \"What fo I want?\" I asked her, I looked at her suspiciously. \"Me?\" She answered, not sure of the answer. We laughed. She stood up and lent her hand to me, I looked at her with curious eyes. \"Edward's gonna want his breakfast now,\" she told me. \"Oh yeah, sure, after I dress up,\" I told her,[Half-naked Alex Pettyfer... YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM] she nodded and went down. As soon as the coast is clear I took my phone, I ringed my office, \"Good morning, this is Mr. Kingsley's secretary speaking,\" Ashley sounded bored. Ashley's my twenty-two year old secretary. \"Ashley, this is Mr. Kingsley.\" I told her. \"Oh, Mr. Kingsley, what would you want?\" She asked trying to flirt with me. \"Surely, not you,\" I whispered. \"What?\" She asked. \"Oh nothing, listen I need you to cancel all of my appointments for one whole month. Just send in the reports for me to check the details,\" I told her, \"Okay, sir,\" she told me. After the call to my office, I called the airport and reserved a flight for Florida the following day. I also called the hotel in Disney World for a booking of two rooms for five days in the hotel, one for Poppy and me, and another for Edward, for five days. It was my own little surprise for Edward and Poppy. I got my casual shirt and went down to eat breakfast. When Poppy saw me she asked,\"why didn't you wear your office suit?\" Edward looked at me,\"Daddy, why are you wearing a shirt?\" He was so used to seeing me in my suit he never got to see me in my casual wear. \"Well, aoart from taking a month off from the firm, I also booked us a flight to Florida and reserved us some rooms in Disney World.\" I told them casually, looking up the ceiling. \"REALLY?!\" Edward asked, surprised. \"Yeah, and me and mommy have another surprise for you,\" I told Edward. \"What?\" he asked with his eyes wide. \"Well, how do you say that you'll have a sister or brother?\" Poppy asked. \"I'm gonna be a big brother?!\" he said, looking disappointed. I asked him,\"wouldn't you like a playmate?\" He looked at me. \"Nope, it's just that Robert said that you're going to kick me out if you have another baby with mommy,\" he told me with his sad eyes. \"Baby, no matter how many babies mommy and daddy has you'll always be one of my babies, no matter how old you get,\" Poppy reassured him. \"then, how come I don't see him?\" He asked. \"well, he's in mommy's stomach right now,\" I answered. Well, Edward went to his mommy and he touched her belly.\"mommy I don't see anything,\" he told her. \"I promise you baby, you will,\" she told him, smiling. \"Now, who's that Robert you were talking about?\" I asked him. \"He's a big kid from the day care and he says that I'm ugly and that you're just keeping me because you just want a baby and he told me that after you have another baby, you're gonna leave me on the streets,\" he told us crying. \"Baby, we will never ever leave you, we love you and after the baby is born you will still be here,\" I told him. \"We still have to be packing, we're going to stay in Disney World for five days,\" and he cheered up and asked me,\"are we going to ride those airplanes like the ones mommy rides when she's on a trip?\" He asked me. \"Yes we are,\" He smiled. \"Now,\" I carried him and tickled him,\"daddy, stop---\" he kept on laughing. \"Who wants to be a big brother?\" I asked him. \"ME!\" He aswered. \"What? The Tickle Monster can't hear you,\" I told him. \"MEE---\" He shouted and laughed. Poppy was washing the dishes. PPOV: Edward may look a lot like Freddy, but he did sure get his attitude from me. I was pretty dramatic as a child. I'll do anything to get what I want. I never wanted to have a sister but when I realized that having a sister was fun, I loved Molly. Molly was the only one REALLY there for me. When I realized Ruby and my then boyfriend, Roddy. Molly has been there, my ups and downs. She also went to Abbey Mount but that was after I graduated already. She has been in contact with me. Mrs. Kingsley, my mother-in-law, was surprised that we were nothing alike. She was a good girl. Haha. My own sweet little sister. We still keep in contact. Now, she's studying medicine and wants to be a surgeon. I'm glad that Edward said his problem about the bully Robert. Robert was the guy from the day care, I thought that him and Edward were friends. All this time, he was bullying my baby. I better change my son's day care center. Next September, he'll go to school like every little kid has to and Freddy and I have another baby to take care of. I could see that Edward would be going to school. I'll be fetching him and helping him with homework. Freddy would go home that night and is going to kiss me, Edward, and the baby. He's gonna give Edward a night bath and I'll be dressing Edward up. Edward's going tor ead a story for him and we'll kiss the baby good night. A picture of the perfect family. I could see that as we grow old the children would be as successful. A girl who'll be going to Abbey Mount and Edward going to Freddy's alma matter. As they go to that stage, they would find their own true loves just like how I met Freddy and have the same happy lives with lots more of grandchildren. Freddy would love that. He is very fond of children. I finished the dishes and went on to packing with Freddy. Sorry, had to cut it there. It was short I know but I promise you that you'll figure out what would happen in the next chapters in a few days' time.[Chapter 4] Hey guys!!! I know it's quite annoying but I'll take some time to update. Okay, so I've done chapters 3 and 4 but an unfortunate event happened when I was going somewhere. My taxi got into an accident and when I got off I forgot my envelope that has all my paper works in, not to mention ALL of it, even my school things. So… That's why I'm taking such a long time because I'll have to rewrite everything and I'll have to recall what I have written down that paper. And then, yeah, I'm gonna announce that I'll quit this story??? JOKE! I could update. But the update will come in late March that's the time of year when I won't have to be busy for school work. So I'm super sorry! The unfortunate thing that happened to me won't hinder me from finishing my story! SORRY GUYS!:(( I'll try and update as soon as I could but while it's not being updated try and bear with the first two chapters… In-love-with-my-own-sins[Chapter 5] Finally… A new chapter has arrived. Got that writer's block away from me. Has been very busy. Have to go to summer school… So yeah… Disclaimer: I do not own anything except for Edward and the unborn child and the OCs…. Please do not sue me…. Chapter 3: Third person POV: She wakes up in the morning knowing that someone completely ruined her life in the harshest way they could. She looks at herself in that old mirror she has she knew nothing will ever be the same again. Poppy made a mark on her life something bad earning her the part of the person you would have to get revenge at person in her life. She knew Poppy Moore was a spoiled, rich, bitch who would never get anywhere in life except ofor a scrutty job in a fast food chain and would live in athrown down apartment but all of these views changed when she saw a news about the new star who just made the blockbuster list, the \"next Julia Roberts\" as the press would say. It was none other than Poppy. She knew she had to do something. A world that's under Poppy Moore may be a world that meant death to everyone who hates her. For these past four years she has been planning her revenge against her. She knew of the eighth year reunion of Abbey Mount, she'd do everything to bring shame to the girl who \"changed Poppy's life\" in that very same school. She knew it meant to search her background but what she just saw is that her background from four years ago which she knew from four years ago when she entered the lime light. She thought of Freddie Kingsley, They might have broken up, he might have caught her cheating. He might have broken up with her and didn't forget what happened. She had to find where Freddie is now. After some typical research ion his background she found out Freddie was now part of a big law firm in Los Angeles. Mister Kingsley, she thought, it's time to pay you a phone call. He dialed the telephone number she had gotten from the site of his law firm but instead of hearing a guy's English accent it was a girl's annoyed voice asking her what she wanted. \"Is Attorney Kingsley there?\" She asked the receptionist. \"Miss, unfortunately, he's asked to move all of his appointments next month, would you happen to have any appointment with him?\" The receptionist asked.\"I didn't schedule for any appointment. Hmmm. Do you know where he did go?\" She asked. \"I may be thinking that he's spending some time with his son,\" the receptionist replied. \"So is he married?\" she asked the receptionist. \"From what I've heard he's divorced I only see Edward here but I never did see a wife of his own,\" the receptionist replied instantly, but before she could even ask her own question the receptionist asked her,\"why do you even bother asking? Are you some kind of relative to Mister Kingsley cause I assure you he isn't interested I anyone but his son,\" the receptionist told her and, as if by stimuli, she hang the phone. Now that it's all taken care of, she thougnt, I just need to do one thing, instantly, she called the airport and booked tickets to England wherein Poppy will taste her revenge. The down fall of her rival that was what she wished eversince she has heard from Poppy. Poppy Moore, I hope you didn't fly high enough or you'll really taste my revenge, she thought. Okay, s that's chapter three. No nasty reviews. That's the closest I coulg get to the original draft. -in-love-with-my-own-sins.[Chapter 6] Chapter 4: Surprises! AN: Hey! :) I decided to write and enter it a little sooner than expected. The reason is that we'd be gone this Saturday. My dad had this offer to be in a hotel and, yeah, I'll be super busy exploring things I have done so many times already.:) So, I hope you enjoy this chapter!:) Disclaimer: I do not own the film and the song- it's by Rob Thomas in the OST of The Robinsons. FPOV: The other day, while driving, I turned the radio on and heard a familiar song. It goes like: Let it go, Let it roll right off your shoulder Don't you know The hardest part is over Let it in, Let your clarity define you In the end We will only just remember how it feels Our lives are made In these small hours These little wonders, These twists & turns of fate Time falls away, But these small hours, These small hours still remain Let it slide, Let your troubles fall behind you Let it shine Until you feel it all around you And i don't mind If it's me you need to turn to We'll get by, It's the heart that really matters in the end Our lives are made In these small hours These little wonders, These twists & turns of fate Time falls away, But these small hours, These small hours still remain All of my regret Will wash away some how But i can not forget The way i feel right now In these small hours These little wonders These twists & turns of fate These twists & turns of fate Time falls away but these small hours These small hours, still remain, Still remain These little wonders These twists & turns of fate Time falls away But these small hours These little wonders still remain I felt like I haven't been paying attention to Edward and my growing family, I felt like I needed time to get to know them again and with Poppy's \"year of vacation\" it was the perfect timing. Today, after work, I'd have to tell Nina, my secretary, to have to move my plans for tomorrow and the next four weeks. I have a surprise to plan. In my office, I didn't think of anything except for the perfect surprise. It was sort of hard because with Poppy's stardom and everything, we had to keep this a secret from her fans, not until after the Abbey Mount reunion. We planned in confessing this to everyone in Abbey Mount first before officially publicizing it to almost everyone here on this planet. I had the perfect plan. First and foremost I had to call the airport for some tickets. PPOV: We were doing the usual things we did everyday, and ever since I've decided to have a \"vacation\" for one whole year without the press bothering me, I had to stay in the house up until Edward and Freddie come home. The reunion will be about two weeks from now so I still had about seven days to spend my time alone with our house. Freddie came down stairs and surprised me with his hands covering my not-yet noticeable tummy and he old me,\"Love, you need to rest, I'm gonna continue it,\" I ignores him and he knew what that meant. \"Okay, Poppy,\" he told me. \"You know, I've got a surprise for Edward and you,\" this made me stop. Curiously, I asked him,\"What is it?\" He just gave me a soft chuckle and went to his part of the table. \"Come on, would you just at least give me a clue?\" I asked him, I was eager to know what his surprise was. \"Not until he wakes up,\" he told me as he was getting toast. A few minutes later, Edward went down the stairs and automatically went to the dining room. \"Honey,\" I told him,\"daddy has a surprise for us.\" And he ran to the table, as eager as I was to know the surprise. \"Well, how do I say this?\" He said. \"Uhmm… I've decided that for the past few weeks we've been pretty busy and I've decided to have a short vacation from the firm for about a month and I got us some tickets to Florida and I got us booked in Hollywood hotel for a week and we're going to Disney World!\" He told us. AN: So there you have it. Just a few notes: No nasty comments I can't upload on the weekends I have a family reunion with my maternal cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandma. Plus with my gay Couz if I get lucky enough. I may not be uploading every weekends, I've been quite busy during my break. A lot of outings and everything.[Chapter 7] Chapter 5: Busted?! AN: Yeah, it's early. I was finished with it. And this is what I am catching up to. Plus, I'm gonna be gone for a long, long time I believe I owe this to my readers…:) DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN TMZ OR ANY WILD CHILD CHARACTERS!!! :P PPOV: Edward was really excited; he was literally jumping on his seat. As much as we're having fun, I felt guilty because I had to pretend- I had to wear a wig and sunglasses so nobody could notice that I am Poppy Moore. I'm pretty thankful that Edward understood why I had to do this. \"Honey,\" Freddie told me. \"Hmmm…\" I said. \"We're landing,\" he told me. \"Mommy, we're in Florida!\" Edward almost shouted. I sat up straight and just as we were about to land I noticed that both of Edward and Freddie looked exactly alike when they stare at the horizon. I quietly took out my camera and took a picture of them and I sat as if it never happened. I would just have to show it later to them. WILDCHILDWILDCHILDWILDCHILD I went out from the airport; I haven't expected to go out of the airport that easily I usually would have to face a lot of paparazzis and a lot of personnal question which I would usually ignore. Freddie said that I should watch over the things and he'll get the car that we borrowed from a college friend in Florida. I slowly removed my sunglasses when a strong gust of wind blew my wig off, I was quite surprised that I stood up for aboout a fewminutes, itr was a good thing no one noticed it. I quickly got the wig and put it back my hair before anyone recognized me. Third Person POV: He stood behind the bushes; he was there to find an entertainer whom he could take a picture of and earn money. He was known as paparazzi. He worked for TMZ. He hid and he was starting to get bored, no one came out of the airport. When he was about to leave, a blonde girl came out. He was surprised because that girl looked a lot like Poppy Moore. He knew it wasn't her because she knew how dangerous it could've been for her to go anywhere. Just as he was about to leave, a huge gust of wind came blowing and that girl's hair fell off. Wait, that isn't right, thought the guy. He looked at the girl and he knew that he was right. It was indeed Poppy Moore. He quickly got his camera and took the picture of the young actress. He looked at the time and it was almost time for his deadline but, instead of going, he stayed on his place. He was determined to know why she was there. Later on, he noticed that she met a tall man and a kid who looked like the man. The tall man kissed her and the little kid hugged her. He took another picture of them that could be shown later on. The mystery of Poppy Moore's private life will finally be revealed, he thought to himself. AN: A little cliffie for everyone to enjoy. It was short, again… Just a few reminders: No nasty reviews. No updates this weekend. I'll be in my family reunion. I'll update as soon as I get on the computer.[Chapter 8] Chapter 6: Big Problem! AN: I'm back. And here's a new update.:) Disclaimer: Freddie: She's late. Poppy: I know. She said I could say the disclaimer if she's late. Freddie: Say it… OUT LOUD… SAY IT! Poppy: inlovewithmyownsins doesn't own anything except for the OCs. PPOV: As we got off our car, Freddie checked us in while I was keeping Edward company. We played and suddenly, I asked him,\"What do you think the baby will be?\" I asked him. He answered,\"I think he's a boy,\" he told me. \"Is it a boy?\" he asked me. \"I don't know, honey,\" I told him. When Freddie came to us, he had the room key and he took us to the 14th floor for our room. Freddie and I decided to be with him for a while before going to our rooms. So I turned the TV on. The show was TMZ and I saw a very familiar picture. \"Freddie, look,\" I told him. \"Why?\" He asked me. \"Just. Look.\" I told him. When he looked he saw my picture. \"Oh no,\" he told me. Freddie and Edward had been there on the photo. \"This photo's gonna start a lot of rumors,\" he told me. \"I'll get in touch with my manager and publicist,\" I continued,\"I won't let this photo get in the way of our vacation and family time with Edward.\" Harvey Levin, the producer of the show, asked,\"Who are those people?\" He asked. The man with long blonde hair answered,\"no one knows about the private life of Poppy Moore, no one knows if she's married or whatever,\" he told Harvey. I went to the other room and called thru my phone my publicist, Holly, I told her,\"Holly, have you seen the news?\" I asked. \"Yeah, and a lot of wesites are questioning about the picture,\" she told me. \"Tell the press that if they want to hear my explanation that they should leave me alone for one whole month leaving me alone for a short vacation,\" I told her. \"But--\"I cut her off. \"I'll tell you as soon as you get here; I'm staying here in Hollywood Hotel in Florida. Would you come?\" Holly answered,\"I'm coming there; I'm getting the first flight going there.\" She immediately hangs the phone and I immediately called my manager, Paolo. He didn't answer, instead it was his voice call saying,\"Hey this is me, Paolo, say your message after the beep and if you're lucky I might just answer back,\" BEEP. \"Paolo, it's me, Poppy. Come here to Hollywood hotel in Florida, ASAP! I know you heard the news, I owe you an explanation,\" I told him. Author's Note: Sone reminders, again I will be out of town, my dad's taking us out of the province!:) HOORAH! And I can't update because it's up until Wednesday, not unless, there's Wi-Fi over there which I hope they have. And no nasty reviews please.[Chapter 9] Chapter 6: Explanations... AN: So I'm back and I'm giving this as a treat for all of you. And since I;m in the Philippines, it's our vacation, summer vacation, and I've had lots and lots of things to do. I'll have to go to a lot of places and some of them may involve not having Wi-fi or any sort of material with the word internet, so yeah. I'm having another family reunion- dad's side. Another out of the province thing I need to attend. This Sunday, so yeah....:) DISCLAIMER: I do not own anything about the real Wild Child plot...:) Although, I wish I did...:D Third Person's POV: Poppy waited for her manager and her publicist to come to their hotel, she was worried, afraid that the media to find them, if the media would catch them, her secret might be revealed and she didn't want that to happen. She didn't bother to check any of the showbiz news in fear of the worst, but knowing her publicist, she could have released the statement already. A few hours of waiting and she finally received a call from Holly. \"Hello,\" Poppy told her. \"Poppy, what room are you in?\" Holly asked Poppy. \"Are you with Paolo?\" Poppy asked her publicist. \"Yeah, he's with me,\" she told Poppy. \"Okay, I'm in room 904, we're in room 904,\" she continued,\"questions later,\" she told Holly. \"We'll be right up,\" Paolo told her. He probably got the phone from Holly. PPOV: A few minutes of waiting and I've finally heard a doorbell out of our room.\"Freddie, would you pleane open the door,\" I told him. He didn't say anything he just went directly to the door and opened it and I've suddenly heard a \"POPPY, Hon-- WHO ARE YOU?!\" I heard Freddie chuckle and he answered,\"Poppy's right in the room,\" he told Paolo. \"Thanks,\" Holly said. He made his way back to me and sat right next to me. \"Guys, I owe you an explanation,\" I told them. \"And, Paolo, you shouldn't shout or anything because the child's sleeping,\" I warned Paolo. \"Freddie and I will explain everything to both of you,\" I explained. \"Where should we start?\" Freddie asked them. Paolo answered,\"from the beginning.\" \"Okay,\" I started. \"Remember when you discovered me?\" I asked paolo and he just nodded. \"Well, I've been married for a year and I have one baby then,\" I told him. \"And I'm her husband,\" Freddie answered. \"I haven't been taking any of them to any premieres because I didn't want my son's childhood to be ruined by running from paps and other things,\" I told them. \"Yes, he's my son,\" as Paolo and Holly stared at the sleeping figure of Edward. \"So-- What now?\" Paolo asked the two. \"Well, I'm taking a year off because I'm pregnant,\" I told him. \"But, the truth is that I'll be admitting the truth after I've admitted it to my friends in a reunion in my former school,\" I told them. \"And when will that be?\" Asked Holly. \"About a week from now,\" I told her. They both looked at each other and nodded,\"look, Poppy, we need to take all the information you gave us for a few minutes,\" said Holly honestly. Thank God that they both accepted it and thanked me for telling the truth before everyone else knew, apart from our family, and they both left at the same time for their flight, you don't expect them to stay there very long cause they have other businesses. This left us to enjoy the rest of the week to have fun with my family. As I watched on the side lines and took some pictures of Edward and Freddie as they had fun together, Poppy took pictures, while still on her disguise. There you have it the final chapter before the reunion itself. So who is the mystery person? RUBY OR HARRIET that is the question...:) NO NASTY REVIEWS!:)[Chapter 10] Chapter 7: Reunion Disclaimer: I do not own Wild Child cause if I do, then who knows what I might've done to it. Third Person POV: As they made it out of the airport, Mrs. Kingsley made her way through the crowd and began hugging the three of them. \"Poppy, Freddie, I haven't seen you in quite some time, is this Edward, he's grown so much,\" she said in just one breathe. \"Yeah, listen, mom. Can we go to the house, first,. It's really not safe, we'll explain it to you later,\" said Freddie. XxxxxxXxxxxxx As soon as they went inside Mrs. Kingsley told them, \"now, for those explanations.\" Freddie's eyes widened, \"Oh yes- er- I don't know how to say this, but- er- Mom, er- Poppy's er- pregnant, and er- we er- plan er- on telling er- the press about her er- private er- life as soon as possible, after the reunion.\" Freddie told his mother. \"Honey, whatever you decide will be fine for me, you're not a four-year-old who still needs his mother to decide what you've got to wear,\" his mother told him. \"Now, you better get some rest, you know where your rooms are, you're going to have a rather busy day tomorrow,\" Mrs. Kingsley told them after sighing. XxxxxxXxxxxx The school was still the same, nothing changed, really. The outside looks were still of the same color and the same style as it was, \"never changed,\" Freddie muttered under his breath. \"Shall we go in?\" asked Freddie. Poppy laughed at that but nodded, she's been dying to see her friends again. There was dancing and catching up, \"I see a lot of people turned up,\" Freddie said. \"Well, I better see the person who made this all possible. She may as well see me.\" Freddie told his wife. Still don't see her former roommates, she just decided to do a little tour for herself. She roamed the school, she saw that they put the lacrosse pictures of them winning beside her mother's picture. \"There you are,\" said a very familiar voice that Poppy remembered. \"We've been waiting for you for ages!\" Said another familiar voice. \"KATE! DRIPPY! JOSIE! KIKI!\" She shouted, \"I haven't seen you in forever!\" Poppy said. \"You might not have heard of us but we certainly heard of you,\" said Kate. \"So, what happened with Freddie? Did he break up with you or did you break up with him?\" Asked Josie. Poppy laughed, \"I didn't break up with him, silly,\" Poppy said. \"So he broke up with you?\" Asked Drippy. \"NO!\" Poppy said rolling her eyes. \"I've been Poppy Kingsley since after college!\" Said Poppy. The four stared at Poppy with their jaws locked and wide eyes. \"Surprise!\" Said Poppy. AN: NO NASTY REVIEWS!:)[Chapter 11] Chapter 9: Catching up Author's Note: Sorry if I haven't updated since forever but here it is!:) Disclaimer: Poppy: OH MY MY MY! She's not here again! Oh well, in-love-with-my-own-sins isn't the owner of Wild Child... In-love-with-my-own-sins: *Pants* No! I *Pant* missed *Pant* my *pant* disclaimer. *PANT* PPOV: Oh my gosh, they weren't reacting. \"Guys?\" I asked them. \"Oh my Poppy! I didn't know. Why didn't you tell us?\" Kiki asked. \"Yeah, and how's life been?\" asked Josie. \"What does he do now?\" asked Drippy. \"Where is he?\" asked Kate. \"WOAH! One by one,\" Poppy told them. \"Okay, it's because I want my private life to be a secret, only my family knows, they were the only ones in the wedding. Yes, that includes Freddie's mother. Well, I have one son who's five and another one on the way,\" Poppy told them. All of the four girls gasped. \"Oh my gosh, Poppy,\" said Kate. \"Freddie's a lawyer in the US right now and he's talking to matron,\" Poppy told them. \"Enough about me, what's happening in your life right now?\" Asked Poppy to the four of them. They stared at each other, \"Well,\" said Kiki, hesitantly. \"I've been going out with this guy, his name's Robby. He came with me in Oxford, and, we just sort of clicked,\" she said blushing. Kiki blushed cherry red. \"Well, I am single and available at the moment. Just broke up, like, last week,\" said Kate, \"I told him I needed space. He accepted my decision really well, though.\" The five of them all laughed. \"Kate, come and give me a hug. I know you'll find the right one in due time,\" Poppy assured her. \"Well, I'm going out with a childhood friend of mine. We got separated when I studied in Abbey Mount but he found me anyways,\" Drippy told them. \"He said that no matter where I go, he'd always find me and give his life up for me,\" she told them. \"Josie,\" the four of them looked at her, \"what happened to your love life?\" Asked Poppy. \"Well,\" she showed her finger, it had a ring, \"Oh,\" \"My,\" \"Gosh,\" Poppy, Drippy, and Kate gasped. \"SURPRISE!\" Said Kiki and Josie together. \"I'm the only one who knew,\" Said Kiki. \"How should I explain this?\" Asked Josie. \"From the start looks like a nice idea,\" Kate told her. \"Okay, after we graduated, I studied in France,\" Josie looked alive, \"in my new school, a lot of people didn't seem to befriend me. And, as I was hurrying off to make it to class, I bumped into a guy named John. I told him I was sorry and that I was sort of hurrying into class. He didn't like the fact that I bumped him but asked what my next class was. I told him I had to go to psycology and I was sort of lost. He told me that he would help me and that's only because the teacher of psychology was really strict,\" Josie was now slughtly blushing. \"He's a year older than I was and knows the school very weel because his dad was a board member of the school. He was also part of those who pranks a lot of students, sort of a jerk. But what amazed me was he didn't put a prank on me and seemed eager to catch up to me and also the one to offer me any help on my academics, I said I didn't need any help and asked him why was he treating me different from others. That's where all of the secrets been exposed. He said that he liked me and that no one's ever made him feel that way before,\" Josie told the others. \"After dating for more than 5 years, he proposed to me six months ago and last month I officially became his wife,\" Josie told them. \"Poppy,\" Drippy called her, \"tell us what you've been doing.\" Poppy looked at them. \"You all know that I am an actress,\" everyone nodded. \"Right after college, I married Freddie, we just graduated from college, said that the time was now right for him to settle down and was not settling for any other girls excpet for me. The wedding was a very small wedding, a few of family friends and family only. And exactly nine months after and eight years after we have met Edward Kurt Kingsley was born, he's with Freddie right now. Freddie worked for a law firm and I worked as an actress. Until a few weeks ago, I learned that I was pregnant yet again,\" she told the four of her best friend. \"Ruby and I? We're no longer friends, cut any of the connection I still had with her. She kept on finding out where I was and is trying to mend our friendship but I really couldn't forget what she did, she wasn't a good friend, she was more of a user than a friend,\" Poppy told the lot and they didn't seem quite surprised. \"And the reason why I haven't been able to contact you for the longest time is that I am afraid that the media would find out what happens outside the limelight. It's really hard to keep it secret for me,\" Poppy explained to everyone. \"Now, why not meet Edward?\" asked Poppy to her true friends. \"Sure!\" The lot answered her, excited. No nasty reviews!:)[Chapter 12] Chapter 10: Kidnapped AN: I know, I've been gone for quite some time. I had writer's block ... So here's the tenth chapter of my fanfic!:) Hope you enjoy it... Disclaimer: I strictly do not own the whole Wild Child...:(( I wish I was that rich... I am not...:(( Edward's POV: Mommy said that she was meeting some of her friends from this school, at least that's what daddy says to me, that's why she walked away from us. \"Daddy, why are we here?\" I asked to my daddy. \"This school is also where I met you mommy, Ed.\" Daddy uses that nickname to me a lot iwhen we were alone, mommy didn't like that nickname. \"You studied here too?\" I asked. \"No, Ed. My mom used to be the one who headed this school, so I had to stay here a lot,\" Daddy told me. We stopped near a really funny place, we were in a place with a lot of doors, \"we met near here, I used to stay here, too. In a bathroom inside my room. Your mommy was trying to escape the one who headed this dormitory. I was taking a bath,\" my daddy told me. \"She really hated Matron,\" he told me. \"Who's Mey- mey-?\" I was cut off, \"Matron.\" My daddy completed. \"She was the one who checked this place, she headed the dorm. Your mommy played pranks on her, do you want a story?\" He asked me. I nodded, I like daddy's stories. They're funny. \"Well, your mommy and a friend of hers was out checking matron's car. She was doing something to it, I didn't know what it was when I saw them. I was coming near them when they noticed me so they hid under the car. Matron caught me going near her car so she shouted my name, I was startled so I dropped my keys. Your mother begged me not to bust her so I agreed. I told matron I dropped of my keys. Your mother's friend coughed a bit so I pretended that it was me who coughed. And then your mother blew her mouth to her arms causing fart noises so I had to pretend that it was me who farted. Matron looked at me suspiciously, I had to say that I ate a bad food, that was why I farted,\" I laughed. \"What is a boy doing here?\" Asked a voice coming from behind. Daddy and I looked behind us, the one who asked was thin, she was wearing a funny dress, she looked scary. \"Matron, or should I call you head mistress now?\" Asked daddy. \"Oh, Freddie, I didn't notice that it was you. Who's this little fellow you're with?\" Asked the girl. \"Oh, this is- er- Edward, my...\" Daddy thought of the right word to say. \"My son,\" he said. \"I married Poppy,\" he informed her. \"Ohhh,\" the girl nodded, \"never expected her to get married and one of the very first one to get hitched,\" she said. Daddy just laughed. She turned to look at me, \"and what are you doing here?\" She asked. I answered almost automatically, \"my name is Edward Frederich Kingsley. I came here cause my mommy and daddy are here and they wanted me to see mommy's school.\" I told her. \"Oh, and who's your mommy?\" She asked. \"My mommy's Poppy Moore and my daddy's Freddie Kingsley,\" I answered her. \"Reminds me a lot of you, Freddie,\" she told daddy. Dad chuckled, \"even Poppy says so.\" I was getting bored, grown-up talks never interested me at all, \"Daddy, can I please play?\" I asked daddy since he had my PSP. \" Don't wander off too much. Your mum would kill me if you get lost,\" he warned me. \"Okay,\" I had this intention of going to places everytime I played. He gave me my PSP and I started playing. I'm pretty sure I wasn't that far off when daddy yelled. \"EDWARD!\" He yelled and then I only saw darkness. Harriett POV: I was back in the place where it all started, I was back where in Abbey Mount. I was searching for Freddie Kingsley when I was a child holding a familiar blonde haired man who was going to the dormitory. He suddenly crouched down and began to tell a story to his son. I was pretty sure this was Freddie. \"What is a boy doing here?\" A familiar voice asked them, she almost didn't change, if you were telling from looking a few years older. \"Matron, or sould I call head mistress now?\" Asked the older man, this was definitely Freddie, \"Oh, Freddie,I didn't notice it was you. Who's little fellow you're with?\" Matron asked Freddie. \"If, this is- er- Edward, my...\" He seemed to hesitate for a second, \"my son,\" he finally choked out. \"I married Poppy,\" he told metron. So that's why they were together, they are married. Well, if I can't have her, I might as well have her son. I started planning on a new tactic, children don't usually stay around that long on the hands of their parents, especially those who had long talks. She would grab the boy by the time he gets out of his father's reach. She knew how she'd always wander off when her parents meet up with a grown-up and talk, it seemed to have lasted an eternity. It was perfect, the plan. If Poppy would like her son to live, Poppy had to give Freddie to her. Nothing would go wrong this time, unlike the last time she tried to frame Poppy for burning the kitchen. \"Daddy, can I please play?\" The boy asked. Finally, he was getting bored. \" Don't wander off too much. Your mum would kill me if you get lost,\" Freddie said. Almost time for my plan. I didn't focus on what they said next, I was counting the time when the boy wouldn't be near his father's reach. Freddie gave him a PSP and I was constantly watching the boy as he slowly walked away from Freddie and Matron, he was getting caught up with the game. I slowly got up and waited for the boy to stand next to me, I was behind a post. Five, four, three, two... I grabbed the boy and ran. I heard Freddie shout, \"EDWARD!\" I didn't have time to check I was pretty sure the boy hit his head on the post where I was hiding. Freddie's POV: I have no idea what was going on right now. At first, I was telling Edward stories here in Abbey Mount and the next thing I saw he was kidnapped. It may have just been Poppy, she might have just been reliving her days here in Abbey Mount by pranking me. She might have instructed Drippy to grab Edward. \"Nice to see you, Matron. And congratulations!\" I told her hurrying up and not waiting for a replyI just ran. I knew where they would hang out. The trophy room. It was the only place where Poppy feels closer to her mother. I ran pass the hallway not caring about the girls who saw me. \"Freddie!\" Someone shouted. I stopped and looked back, it was Kiki. \"Why are you running?\" She asked. \"I know what you're doing, Kiki? Where is he?\" I asked. She looked confused, \"he who?\" She asked me. I saw Poppy and the others come forward. \"Poppy, where's Edward?\" I asked. \"I thought you were with him, we were just finding you, I thought you were with him.\" Poppy told me but I knew better. \"Oh, I know you're hiding him somewhere,\" I told her. \"But Freddie, we didn't even know where you are. How could I pull a prank on you?\" She asked, and I realized that the confusion on their faces were indeed genuine. \"No, no, no, no,\" I murmured. \"This couldn't be happening,\" I told myself. \"Freddie, what's going on?\" Asked Poppy. A million questions formed in my head, including, who was that blonde I saw? What was her motif of taking Edward? How did she know we were here? \"Poppy, it's my fault. It is,\" I admitted, I started to sob. Tears flowed down out of my eyes, I couldn't control it. My son was missing and it was my fault why he was missing. \"Freddie, what is going on?\" Josie asked. I turned to look at Poppy, realization dawned to her. \"Freddie,\" she said, sternly. \"He was just there and he- he- he- was taken by a blonde figure. I thought it was Drippy because I thought you were pulling some kind of prank on me to relive your Abbey Mount days,\" I told them. \"I think we should go to your mother,\" Poppy told me. \"We're coming with you, we're gonna help you find Edward,\" Josie said. \"We're all in this together, nobody gets left behind, we're gonna help Poppy and Freddie find their son,\" Kiki told us. \"Thanks, guys. But I feel like I know who took Edward,\" Drippy said. AN: Did you like it? Oh, yeah, I'm creating a poll. I can't decide whether or not to kill Edward. Hehe...:) PLEASE VOTE!:) And all you've got to do is press that one button below this author's note for the review. No update until 40 reviewers come up!:) Sorry if this is mean...:\"[Chapter 13] AN: Hey y'all! To all the father's out there! HAPPY FATHER'S DAY! YEY! TO ALL THE DADS OR GRANDFATHERS OUT THERE! Y'ALL KNOW WE WOULDN'T LIVE HERE WITHOUT OUR FATHERS. NOW, GIVE YOUR FATHERS A HUG! Here's a fluffy chapter for all of you since it's Father's Day! Disclaimer: I do not own Wild Child! FPOV: I honestly don't know what to do. Edward, even though he had his own imperfection, seemed like one of the most treasured things I had and now he was taken away from me. Poppy and I decided to come home to my mom to tell her all that has happened. With Poppy taking all the courage to tell my mother the whole truth. We had talked about it, we wanted to have a child right after marriage, even if we were just fresh graduates, it would make our lives harder, but happier. And two months after our honeymoon, it was confirmed, Poppy was indeed pregnant with our first child, Edward. We were ecstatic about it, we had taken care of everything we even made bets on what the baby's gender, the pregnancy was the hardest part actually. I could still remember, \"Freddie,\" Poppy would try to wake me up during the late hours of the night, \"I want apple juice,\" she would say. \"We have it in the refrigirator,\" I would counter, \"I finished it already!\" She would whine. \"How about tomorrow?\" I asked. \"No way, I want it now,\" she would pout and I had nothing to counter at that so I get dressed up and find an apple juice during the late night. An during the time of his birth. We were in our house, Poppy was reading a book as I was in our bedroom getting ready for work. \"Freddie!\" She shouted. I came rushing downstairs, \"Just kidding!\" She joked, \"good one, you got me on that one,\" I told her, as I was about to go upstairs cause I was still topless she called me again, \"no, not gonna happen this time,\" I told her. \"No, it's serious,\" she said, with fear on her voice this time. I turned around and saw water dripping on her legs. \"Oh, shit!\" I shouted. I didn't have time to put my top on, the bag was in the car, just in case that time came. I carried her to the car. \"Poppy, relax,\" I told her. \"How can I relax? It's all your fault you, Bastard!\" She screamed. \"Breathe,\" I tried to tell her, trying to be calm, but it wasn't working. I drove as fast as I could to the hospital. I drove as fast as I could while I made a call to Molly. \"Freddie, why are you calling?\" Molly asked, \"is your dad there?\" I asked. \"Yeah, but why're you calling?\" She asked. I was pretty nervous, weat was all over my face and I was hyperventilating. \"Poppy's in labor,\" on top of Poppy's heavy breathing. \"BE LUCKY IT'S ME AND IT'S NOT YOU,\" she shouted. \"Yeah, I think that is in fact serious,\" Poppy's father was there. \"Yeah, I better call my mother. Good-bye,\" I said to them. I immediately called my mother, \"Mom, it's Poppy.\" I said after she answered. \"I'll be in the hospital!\" She said urgently. I parked near the ER and immediately got a wheelchair for my wife who was cussing at me, calling me plenty of words I wish not to describe. Poppy's father said that it was totally normal and that she wouldn't remember anything that she said when she was done giving birth. \"I need to find Dr. Rodriguez,\" I said to the nurse. \"I'm here, what's the problem?\" (AN: I really don't know how to find an OB even if my aunt is one...:P Sorry if I'm mistaken.) She said. \"It's Poppy, her water broke.\" I said trying to be as calm as possible, but not working. \"She needs to be at least to be at least 10 centimeters dilated to be able to push, how far along are the contractions?\" She asked. \"About 5-7 minutes far,\" I told her. \"Okay, we need to keep an eye out for her, put her in the labor room,\" she ordered two nurses. After almost 12 hours of labor, Poppy was finally taken into the Delivery Room, I came along with her. \"I swear, after this delivery I'm gonna cut your dick, FREDDIE! You wouldn't know what hit you!\" She screamed. I was definitely terrified. She was holding my hand and I felt like I was even more in danger than she was. \"YOU SUCK! YOU DID THIS TO ME!\" She screamed. After an eternity of torment a brand new adventure came into my life. \"Would you be honored to cut the umbilical chord?\" Dr. Rodriguez offered. \"Sure, why not?\" I said. It was a boy. My first child, a boy. He was cleaned and was given to me. I carried him for what seemed like an eternity. \"What do you want to name him?\" Poppy was awake and I haven't noticed it. \"I'll give the first name and you give the second name,\" I suggested. \"Sure, no problem,\" she almost whispered, she was too weak to even speak with her own natural voice. \"I want him to be an Edward,\" I said. \"And I Frederich,\" said Poppy. \"You sure you're gonna name him after me?\" I asked. \"Yeah, of course.\" She smiled. I smiled back and turned to look at our son. \"I better inform your families,\" the doctor informed. \"Do you want to be near him?\" I asked. \"Sure,\" she said. \"Hey there, Edward. I promise to you that I'm gonna be the best father that I can be,\" I promised him. I broke that promise. Edward please forgive me if I was not the best dad there is. AN: I'm breathing heavily. I miss my dad so much, even if I just saw him a few minutes ago. They went back home I was left because I study away from home. I feel lucky that I have him as a father. Aren't you happy you have your fathers?:)[Chapter 14] Chapter 11:Troubles of Being a Kidnapper AN: HEY! I'm back. After the Father's Day Special, I thought of what Harriet must have BEEN THINKING.:) Here's the new chapter. Disclaimer: I wish I owned Wild Child!:( Harriet's POV: I got a glass of water from the taps. The boy was still asleep. He hit his head near the post where I took him, luckily. \"Oi,\" I shouted at him. \"Wake up!\" I poured the water on his face. \"MOMMY!\" The boy shouted. \"I'm not your Mummy!\" I scolded him. \"Who are you? Wh-wh-why did you take me? What did I do wrong? Was I a bad boy?\" He asked me. \"That would be none of your business!\" I shouted at him. I knew I had to have a hard chest on this one, his resemblance to Freddie is just too string. But Freddie, it's too late or is it. I took my phone out and checked his number. It rang twice before it was answered. \"Hello, who's this?\" The familiar tone in the voice. \"Freddie Kingsley?\" I asked. \"Yeah, this is him...\" He trailed off, no I wasn't flirting with him. \"I have your son,\" I said as calm as I could possibly say it. \"Do you want to talk to him?\" I asked. \"What kind of animal do you think you are?\" Asked Freddie. \"DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO YOUR SON OR NOT?\" I snapped. \"Of course!\" He yelled. I put the phone near the boy's ears. \"Daddy? Daddy?\" He started crying. And then before I could take the phone away, \"A horse took me! A blonde horse!\" He screamed. Oh shit, I forgot to turn the lights off. I immediately took the phone from him and slapped him so loud that I think Freddie could hear it. \"What do you want?\" He asked from me. Knowing he's a lawyer I know that he would be calm in situations like this when you're negotiating. \"I'll give you even all of my fortunes,\" he said, \"Just don't FUCKING hurt my son,\" he said emphasizing on fuck. \"And if you'd give us our son back, I promise to you we's get you the lowest possible time in prison,\" he negotiated. \"Who said something about money?\" I asked him. \"That's what kidnaps are for, isn't it? The money.\" He explained, confusion in his voice. \"I. Do. Not. Need. Your. Money.\" I said, firmly. \"Then, why'd you kidnap my son and calling me for?\" He asked. \"One word. You.\" I said. \"Me?\" He asked. \"You. Y-O-U.\" I spelled out. \"Why'd you want me for?\" He asked. Now, he's just getting me confused. He tries to intimidate me so I could set his son free. But I wasn't taking this anymore. \"You have one week to think for this. You'd present yourself to me or else your son's life might just be the correct thing to ask for,\" I told him before hanging up. \"Shut up, bastard!\" I yelled to the boy. \"Horse-face!\" He yelled at me. This boy had the nerves. I hate being a kidnapper. AN: I was trying to make it funny with a serious touch. So there you have it, chapter 12!:) I was having author's black. Being a teacher's right hand isn't easy. Glad to know I could still do something that I love. :D Love you, guys![Chapter 15] Chapter 13: Figuring out HEY YOU GUYS! It's been soooo long. And here's the 13th chapter!:) I hope you guys enjoy it!:) Disclaimer: Ruby: Why is she always late? Poppy: Because she takes her studies too seriously! Freddie: Ohhhh, come on you guys, you know how hard it is on her school. She does a lot of things and they have a competition tomorrow, plus, being a teacher's right hand is hard. In-love-with-my-own-sins: HERE I AM! What did I miss? Poppy and Ruby: YOUR DISCLAIMER! In-love-with-my-own-sins: I DO NOT OWN WILD CHILD! Chapter 13: Planning Previously: \" Horse face!\" He yelled. The boy had the nerves. I hate being a kidnapper. Present: FPOV: She wants me, horse faced? It might be Harriet... Yeah, she was obsessed with me! Yes she was. \"Guys, I know who the kidnapper is!\" I shouted. They all looked at me. \"Who is the kidnapper?\" My mother asked. \"Harriet!\" I almost shouted. \"I know that it is weird but it's true. I heard Edward shout 'Horse face,'\" I told them. \"Hold on a minute. How could you be so sure that it is Harriet?\" Poppy asked. They all leaned towards me except for my mom. \"Yes. How could you be so sure of it?\" Mom asked. \"Mom, Poppy, I know it's Harriet. She'd be easy to fool. And Edward shouted 'A HORSE TOOK ME' plus, the girl wanted me. And she wants revenge to Poppy,\" I explained. \"Freddie,\" my mother scolded. \"Listen, mom, I know it's mean. But that's the truth, Harriet does in fact look like a horse-monkey hybrid. None of my clients have been flirting with me. Especially when they know that I am married to the most perfect girl ever,\" I looked at Poppy who reached out for my arm. \"She's only giving me a week to decide on our case. It's either me or the life of Edward. And, as far as I know, she didn't take anyone with her. Edward wouldn't have acted that way if there were in fact others cause he wouldn't have been that fierce. Who would know his own son than the father, right?\" I stared at my mother whom seemingly approved of what I said. \"Gosh, it's been a long long time since we've been planning. And my memory's a little bit blurred. But my mind's into the challenge,\" Kiki said. \"Yeah, it'd be like old times,\" Josie affirmed. \"I thought we'd never be like this,\" Kate admitted. \"All for one and one for all,\" Drippy said. \"Thanks you guys!\" Poppy hugged them while she was crying. I knew it wasn't tears of pain but tears of joy that her friends remained true to her even after throughout the whole years that they've been separated with no contacts with each other. \"I love you reunion, honestly, I do, but my grandson's in deep danger right now to a psychotic freak who still believes that she coulld steal my son to the most perfect daughter-in-law I could ask for,\" my mom said. They all laugh. I'd never expect that from my mother. Poppy wiped her tears. \"So, we better start planning,\" I told them. \"I'm a step ahead of you,\" Kiki told me. She took out a notebook from her purse. I just squeezed Poppy into my arms. \"It'd work, I know it would,\" Poppy told me. \"I know, I've known since the first time I saw your antiques with Matron's car,\" I reassured her. I kissed her head. I hate 11th grade so much... Not only learning that my teacher is a far away relative of mine. :/ So, yeah, a lot of tests. And author's block. A few reamining chapters more and it'd be done already. WHO'D WANT A SEQUEL? NO MEAN REVIEWS!:)[Chapter 16] Chapter 14: Plan on action So, now I am back from outer space!:) Haha... Okay. I'm going to finish this fanfic already. I know the action's just starting and stuff. But I have to finish it before the ending of my first grading in the eleventh grade. I know that it is such a drag, but, yeah, it could 15 or 16 chapters and I'll update everyday up until I finish. DISCLAIMER: Freddie: She asked me to do the disclaimer Poppy and Ruby (While having manicure): Sure, whatever. Freddie: She's not my owner! Poppy and Ruby: Whatever he said. HPOV: Six days have already gone. I wasn't calling him. Let him figure out where I stay in. His bastard's still yelling at me for not returning him to his parents. One more day Harriet. One more and this nightmare's about to be over. I kept on saying that to myself up until my phone rang. I didn't know what to do. It was... a number? FPOV: I did what Josie said. And we perfected it at the span of five days. I slowly dialed in Harriet's real cellphone number using our telephone line and it started ringing. Harriet answered by the fifth ring. \"Hello?\" She asked. She was trying to disguise her voice. GOD, TOO LATE FOR THAT! \"Hello, Harriet,\" I said, trying to make my voice as velvety and sexy as I possibly could. \"Yeah, this is her, who might this be?\" She asked. \"Uhmm, do you remember Freddie Kingsley, the son of your headmistress?\" I asked. She paused for a while. \"Of course, I know him,\" she answered. \"Well, this is him and I was wondering if you would want to have dinner with me?\" I asked. I could hear the girls laughiing downstairs. They were having the times of their lives. Haha... I wouldn't be doing this if my son wasn't captured. I'm betting Poppy might be shaking with anger right now. \"Yeah, of course.\" She almost stammered but was able to say her reply coherently. This is going to be a weird night. \"Yeah, I'll pick you up, around 8? Later in the evening?\" I asked. \"Where do you stay?\" I asked her. \"I'm in my apartment in 494 Camelot Subdivision it's here in London (It's fictional, kay?).\" She answered. JACKPOT! I went down to see that ALL of the girls were laughing. EVEN POPPY! When would the humiliation end. \"Well?\" I asked. \"Time for phase 2,\" was all Kiki said. HPOV: I couldn't believe that Freddie Kingsley actually called me! He might have had a fight with Poppy and their marriage is falling apart. OH MY GOSH! I know I'll take his bastard with me and that I found him and no one could take care of him so I took him in. It was already 7:30 PM. \"OI!\" I yelled. \"WHAT?\" He scowled. \"Wear this,\" I gave him fresh new clothes that I bought earlier. \"You're going to be with your daddy dearest today,\" I told him. He became so happy. \"I HOPE ALL THE POLICE WOULD GET YOU!\" He yelled. \"If you're lucky I'm going to be your new mommy,\" I told him while he glared. \"Now, get ready!\" I shouted and he got up and got into his dress while I wore a new dress I've bought just for this night. FPOV: \"Okay, I'm going. You know the place so, yeah. You could spy on us too. I doubt that she'll leave Edward. She'd be heroic,\" I told them. \"That's why we divided right?\" Said the girls who were dressed in disguises as men. My mom was to be left out of this all. I went to her house and rang the doorbell. It was immediately answered by a small boy, no older and who looked a lot like Edward except... thinner. And paler. \"DADDY!\" It was Edward. \"Oh, hello there Freddie, I've see you have met Edmund,\" Harriet said. GOSH, I COULD SEE RIGHT THROUGH HER! Jossie and Drippy were here was first. I just saw them holding a camera and signalling an okay sign. I just nodded at them and permitted them to go. \"His name's Edward, not Edmund,\" I said through gritted teeth. \"Oh, yeah, totally. Wait, how did you know his name?\" She asked. \"Cause he is my son. He got kidnapped six days ago,\" Edward was just staring at me. \"Oh, yeah, he just ran into me. I was kind enough to take him in, he has been quite quiet about his parents. Since, you're his dad, where's his mom?\" She asked. \"His mom and I have been having troubles, I ended up having custody over him,\" I told her. \"Now, would you accompany me for our date?\" I asked, knowing that she would have enough time later to talk about our future in a restaurant. HPOV: I sat beside him in his car, while his son stayed at the back. So, Poppy and him are having troubles already. So, they broke up? \"So what happened to your wife?\" I asked him. \"Nothing happened to us,\" he told me. \"WHAT? I THOUGHT YOU GAINED CUSTOFY OF YOUR SON FROM THAT FUCKING BIATCH! POPPY MOORE!\" I shouted. \"Do you think that I'd have a date with you? As soon as my son shouted horse-face I knew it was you, you're the only one I knew who had a grudge on Poppy and was obsessed with me, and this song,\" he turned the radio on and Mariah Carey's Obsessed came on: So Oh Oh So Ohhh Will the real MC please step to the mic?

And all the ladies sing, all the girls sing Soo Oohhhh Soo Oohh Obsessed I had to go through this all the way to the police station. I knew that everything that I have ever worked for would never come true. I silently cried until we reached the police station where I was met by four unmistakable people. They had a footage of the early scene. THAT'S IT. THIS MIGHT BE THE SECOND TO THE LAST CHAPTER! Haha... I might elaborate more on the next chapter what happened in the police station.:) P.S. NO NASTY REVIEWS!:)[Chapter 17] Chapter 15: Explanations Sorry, I didn't update yesterday. My friends asked for them to use my laptop. Rather my roommates and ended up having to use it during this curfew time. Because of requirements. And I am a very responsible student.:) Haha... Yeah, right. Okay. ENJOY THE SECOND TO THE LAST. Freddie: She doesn't own anything.:) in-love-with-my-own-sins: WHATEVER! I can dream can I? HPOV: As we got there, I could see the sneakering faces of the girls Poppy called 'friends.' They haven't been contacting each other for eight years and yet here they were having more fun. That was supposed to me if she didn't ruin my whole life. And behind those laughing gits was a girl with anxious looks. Her pale face made her several years older than what she was supposed to be. Who could be none other than Poppy Moore. \"Edward?\" She asked. Whoah, she was really worried. I smirked. \"YOU!\" She exclaimed at me. \"HOW DARE YOU? YOU TRY TO RUIN MY FAMILY. YOU'RE INCLUDING AN INNOCENT LITTLE BOY TO THIS ORDEAL! DO YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD IT FEEL LIKE IF I KIDNAP YOUR SON? OH WAIT, YOU WON'T CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ONE!\" She shouted. How dare she. I scowled at her then the policemen stopped me just mere inches before I grabbed her hair. \"YES!\" I simply answered. \"I was trying to ruin your family, but I was doing it because you. Ruined. My. Life.\" I stated emphasizing on LIFE. She looked at me, \"you couldn't move on? That was about ten years ago. I changed. You should have to. We were children. The fact that I was different then. When you become older, the more you become wiser. Don't you know that, Harriet?\" She said totally using my name. \"Don't. Call. My. Name.\" I stated, I am losing my patience with this girl. I was saved by the guards, \"Mrs. Kingsley, we have to put her into questioning. She shall be put into that room,\" the policemen told her. She nodded. The brat came in with a huge smile in his face, \"MOMMY!\" He called out. They don't even have enough evidence to prove that I am guilty of those charges. When I got in, the detective was already sitting on his chair. It reminds me a lot of law and order. \"Miss?\" He asked. \"Just call me Harriet,\" I bluntly replied. \"Alright, Harriet. I want you to tell me. WHAT WAS YOUR MOTIF FOR KIDNAPPING THE LAWYER'S SON?\" He asked. Emphasizing every single word. \"You do not have any proof of those charges. I demand a lawyer!\" I shouted back at him. He paced back and forth. He came into a complete halt and started to play a Video Clip. It was a clip earlier in the morning when I completely told the boy that I was going to meet his daddy. \"This is a complete outrage! I demand to know who took this video!\" I tried to draw time. \"You need not know who that person is. I ASK THE QUESTION and you JUST ANSWER. Clear?\" He asked. I stayed silent. \"IS THAT CLEAR?\" \"YES!\" I shouted. \"What was your motif?\" He asked slowly and calmly. \"To bait fish withal, if it will feed nothing else. It WILL FEED MY REVENGE! They hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million! Mocked my gains, laughed at my losses, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains. Cooled my friends! HEATED MINE ENEMIES. AND WHAT'S THEIR REASON? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands? Organs? Dimensions? Senses? Affections? Passions? FED WITH THE SAME FOOD. HURT WITH THE SAME WEAPONS. SUBJECT TO THE SAME DISEASES. HEALED BY THE SAME MEANS. WARMED AND COOLED BY THE SAME WINTER AND SUMMER AS A CHRISTIAN IS? If you prick us do we not BLEED? If you tickle us do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And. IF YOU WRONG US SHALL WE NOT REVENGE? \"If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian what is his humility, revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew what should his sufferance be. By. Christian. Example. Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me I WILL execute. And it shall go hard but. I. Will. Better. The. Instructions.\" I finished Shylock's monologue. \"THAT IS MY REASON.\" I said. \"Although, that was quite a speech, revenge is not enough to kidnap an innocent four-year-old who has enough courage to call you horse-face. We would have to talk about this in court. Meanwhile, your home would be here, in jail. Where you wouldn't hurt other four-year-olds who would have anough guts to call you horse-face.\" The detective stated. GREAT JUST GREAT. FIRST, EXPULSION NOW THIS. I really should begin getting a life. As we passed by the lobby of the police station, I saw the happy family that they were. NICE! Why does she get what she wants and I get all the misery? Next one! EPILOGUE! LOVE YA GUYS! To all those who subscribed and favorited me or the story thank you. With all my heart. I looooovvvveeee you! Who wants a sequel? PS. NO NASTY COMMENTS. PLEASE! REPLY!:)[Chapter 18] AN: HEY! Hi! How ya doing. I wanted everything to be perfect before I ended my first ever fanfiction!:D Haha... I know it has been a while. But with 11th grade stress from the school I AM IN. You just don't know what to expect. Haha... Anyways. DISCLAIMER: I wish I owned this movie... But NO! I do not own this movie and I am just a fifteen-year-old so yeah... Chapter 20: Epilogue PPOV: 3 months after the accident. As I stood in front of all sorts of reporters, reporters from news networks, radios, newspapers, teen magazine, and others, I felt some turning from my own tummy. \"Mommy, you don't have to do it you know,\" said Edward who was now 5 years old. I sat next to him, \"I don't need to do it, but I want to, always remember that I'm not doing this for me only, I'm also doing this for you, your daddy, and your baby brother,\" I told him. \"Poppy, four minutes, are you sure you want to do this?\" Paulo, my manager, asked. I took a deep breathe in, \"Yes,\" I've been preparing, literally for the whole three months since the incident. I knew that I couldn't keep anything away from the public eye because of those paparazzi pictures that they showed to the public. I was showing, as in, I gained twenty pounds since the incident, and only found out that we were again having a baby boy. Freddie went near me and hugged my baby bump, \"break a leg,\" he told me. \"What do you mean break a leg? You're going there with me, Freddie.\" I told him. He chuckled, \"I know but I'm not going to answer any of the questions asked,\" he said. \"What makes you so sure of that, Attorney Kingsley?\" I asked, jokingly. Just then, there was a knock on the door followed by a, \"you better get outta there or else the media men are going here and ruin your time.\" Freddie and I slowly walked to the stage and he held my hand gently and as I got to the stage, hundreds of flashes had hit me. \"If anyone would want to ask some questions, feel free to raise your hands.\" I informed them and almost all of them were raising it, WOAH they are addicted to knowing how my life is, so I pointed to the media man nearest to me, he quickly stood up, \"hi, I am Leo Humphrey, and I would like to ask, Ms. Moore who and how the gentleman is related to you?\" He asked so kindly. \"Well, the simplest way to answer is that he is Attorney Frederich \"Freddie\" Kingsley, and my relation to him, uhmmmm...\" I was rudely interrupted, \"Your lawyer?\" I cleared my throat, \"No,\" my husband answered, \"I'm Poppy Moore's husband,\" he said as he kissed my cheek. Oh he was so gorgeous, \"yes, he is my husband. I married him when I was twenty years old, before I was even discovered. We met back when I studied in a boarding school, he is the past principal's son. And I am the luckiest girl to be married to such a gentleman.\" I stated to them. \"According to this photo,\" the reporter held out a photo of a family picture when we got to London, \"you were with a little boy when you got to London, who is he to you?\" Asked another reporter. \"That little boy has a name and it's Edward Frederich Moore-Kingsley, he is our son and he is currently five years old. He is the sweetest child that you would ever know, currently, I'm expecting a second one, as you might have noticed, and I tried to hide them from you because I didn't want to ruin his childhood by a bunch of paparazzis. That's why I kept my private life a secret,\" I told them. I left out the part of the kidnapping because I didn't want anymore issues after this. \"Ms. Moore,\" a reporter stated, \"what is the next step for you and your family?\" he asked. \"Well, if I may,\" Freddie started. \"I feel like because Poppy loves this profession, I think that our family should learn how to handle everything that comes together with her popularity. The scandals, rumors, paparazzis, stalkers, and the obsessed fans that comes along with it,\" he stated. \"And as for me, I think I should learn how to not get jelous when my wife kisses other men for her movies. I am, after all, the jelous type. But just for her happiness, I guess, I should get used to what makes her the Poppy that I love,\" he stated. I whispered, \"and I thought that you weren't going to answer.\" He chuckled slightly, \"I know but doesn't my opinion count as well?\" He asked. \"Point well taken, attorney,\" I said. \"Does anyone have any question for Ms. Moore or Atty. Kingsley?\" The man from the PA announced. Just then a reporter asked us to tell our story, how we met and how we hooked up. I laughed at that. \"Shall we?\" I asked Freddie. He laughed, we told the story, shortly filling in the stories of how I got to Abbey Mount and how we met, the fire incident, the pranks that I did, Matron, and who would forget Harriet. Which was really funny. They are very reason why we were there in the first place and the very reason why we two got together. After the press conference, we left the studio and headed out to our house. \"You did such a great job,\" I said to Freddie. \"Well, if it's not because of my wonderful wife who gives me the inspiration and my sons who gives me the strength to do what I do best,\" he said. \"But you've got to admit, media is quite annoying,\" he added. I laughed at that statement. We got to our house and Freddie carried Edward to his room. I slowly got inside our house, funny how it was dark. I turned on the light and there was a big SURPRISE that waited for me. And then there was the whole crew. \"Would we leave you behind on a big day like this?\" Jossie asked. \"Of course not,\" I said. This was gonna be one hell of an adventure. Okay, that's it it's done. Bye. No nasty comments. ","Summary":" WILD CHILD THE REUNION AN: MY FIRST FANFICTION! Be nice... Anyways... Disclaimer:. IOWNADVDBUTNOTTH"},{"Movie":"Wild Child","Title":"Really a Wild Child?","Author":"The Phantom Dragon","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5322057","Passage":"[Chapter 1] OK this is not my story originally, it's miles89's but she wasn't going to finsh it and said I could take over. So to make things clear, the first 17 chapters are hers, the rest is me. Summary: What if Poppy Moore was kicked out of Abbey Mount accused of starting that fire? What if her friends found out the truth after she left? And what about Freddie and that letter she left him? chapter 1: Leaving Poppy's POV I could see the disappointment in his eyes, I well and truely fucked up for real this time. Me and my damn lighter! I mean what was I thinking? I should have informed someone about the fire, though I swear I put it out. I'm sitting in the car right now with my dad next to me, leaving Abbey Mount. The court had decided, much to Harriet's pleasure that I was to be expelled. So now i'm leaving, going back to LA, leaving Abbey Mount, my friends who hate me, and...Freddie behind. \"Dad, say something\" He sighed. \"What can I say Poppy? I really thought this school would change you, I thought you would finally learn something and grow up\" After actually making friends, and meeting Freddie, I actually believed I could change things around too, but I messed up, I guess I got what I wanted, well what I thought I wanted. \"I tried dad, I really did\" is all I could say. \"I guess not hard enough Poppy\" Great, he doesn't even believe me. I can't say I didn't see that, I have always messed up since my mum died. \"I promise, it will be different when we get home dad, I promise\" He didn't respond. No one's POV He sat with the letter on the desk before him. Many times he picked it up, but couldn't find the strength to open it, and read what was written inside. He didn't think there was any need now that she was gone. It was all over. The door opened and he heard a sigh, someone came and sat next to him. \"Darling are you alright?\" his mum asked. He shook his head and smiled \"Yeah, i'm fine\" She knew him too well, only a mother would know her son that well. \"Have you read it? The letter?\" she asked. He looked at the letter and shook his head. \"What was left to say? She lied and hurt us, she almost burnt the whole school down, I don't think anything she says matters anymore\" \"Oh Freddie\" she hugged her son and then stood up to leave, however reaching the door she looked back around at her son. \"I do think she tried, she tried her hardest\" \"Not hard enough\" Hope you guys like it! Review please![Chapter 2] Chapter II: Truth Poppy's POV I heard footsteps and pulled my quilt off my head looking at the time, 7am. I looked up. \"Come here\" Molly smiled and climbed into my bed and I wrapped my arms around her. \"You didn't come to me when you guys got in\" \"I know Mollster, I was just tired, I'm sorry\" \"Its ok, i'm just glad your back. Now you can cut my crusts for me every morning once again\" I laughed. \"Yeah, I guess I can\" Then we went into that weird silence, neither of us sleeping, but also not talking, however I was waiting for it. \"What went wrong?\" she asked. \"Everything, I messed up as always, only this time I was trying to intentionally\" \"You miss being there, don't you?\" Yeah, I missed being there, I missed the beds there, even though the sheets made me itch, I missed Drippy and her 11am Wheel Wagon, even though they were full of way too much sugar. oh and that gross butty thing that Freddie made-never mind, and believe it or not, I missed Lacrosse. \"Night Mol\" Meanwhile 12pm in England... Everyone was sat in the dining hall at lunch time, they waited for Mrs Kingsley to arrive, and as she did they all stood up, and then sat down again. There was one empty seat at the one table where Kate, Drippy and their friends sat every day at lunch. \"I guess it was all real, she's really gone\" Drippy said breaking the silence. Kate nodded in agreement \"I guess so, I was quite surprised she confessed and owned up\" \"I didn't think she wanted to leave that bad, I mean I actually thought she liked us, that she wanted to stay\" \"If she thought that then she wouldn't have wrote such horrible things in that email of hers!\" Kate said to the others. Drippy meanwhile was in deep thought. \"Yeah well the stroppy cow got what she wanted in the end, and that too by using us, lets just forget 'er\" Josie snapped. They began eating, however Drippy was still thinking. Then her eyes lit up. She leaned in and whispered to Kate. \"Where's the email?\" All 3 girls looked at her. \"Why? There's no need to read that damn thing again!\" \"Its just, I had a thought\" Drippy said drifting into her thoughts again. \"Drippy? You still with us?\" Kate laughed waving her hand over Drippy's face. \"Well? Do you still have it?\" she asked. \"Um, yeah, its in our room\" \"So what are we waiting for? Lets go\" she said at once and got up to leave the hall. The others sighed and reluctantly followed closely behind her. Once they got into their room Kate went over to her desk and picked up the letter and handed it over to Drippy who took it and started examining it. Finally after a few moments she looked up at KiKi. \"Do you think we could get into the school's computer system?\" She shrugged. \"Yeah, why not, wouldn't be the first time I would be\" They all looked at her questioningly. \"What? Come off it, it ain't like its illegal\" she laughed. \"So ya gonna tell us what this is all 'bout drippy?\" Josie asked. \"This email was sent at 11.43am\" she then stopped to think. \"AND?!\" they all yelled in unison. \"Right, well its just I came to get Poppy just after 11am to tell her Freddie was waiting, I know that because I was off to get my 11 o'clock wagon wheel\" Kate caught on. \"So this email...Christ, it wasn't Poppy who sent it? Cause she had left already right?\" \"Yeah\" \"And she always forgot to sign off remember?\" KiKi added. \"So that means-\" Josie started to work out. \"-that we can find out who sent the email if we look up on the system\" Kiki finished off. \"Oi! I was gettin to dat\" The girls got excited, they knew they were on to something, and that Poppy wasn't as bad as they thought she was, that is until someone who had heard everything walked in. \"She may not have said all of those things, but she did try and burn down the school, so before you get your hopes up high remember she still won't be allowed back in, and honestly, I think its better that way\" All the girls looked at the door way to see an annoyed Freddie standing there. Hope you guys like it! Review please![Chapter 3] Chapter III: Missing You Freddie's POV \"Wow he looks hot when he's angry\" Drippy whispered. I walked into the room closing the door behind me, as I knew we could get into trouble if I was found in here. \"She may have started the fire, but at least we know she wasn't such a bitch, she actually appreciated our friendship\" Kate snapped in defense. I snorted. \"Oh yeah, using us all to get out of this place, thats really friendship appreciated\" \"Freddie mate, you got stung, she hurt ya so of course your pissed off mate, but do ya really think that what happened between you wasn't real?' Josie questioned. Of course it wasn't real, at least for her it wasn't. For me, of course it was, she made me fall for her, she knew I liked her, she knew she was my weakness and she used that against me. Poor pathetic desperate Brit boy, that's what she probably thought every time she saw me. She must have been having a right laugh after our date was over. \"It was...at least for me. But she used me, she didn't care about me, I was just her ticket out\" \"Your wrong\" I looked up at Kate \"excuse me?\" \"After your date, she came back and had so much love in er eyes, an- \"STOP! I don't need you to tell me lies just to- \"Its not a lie, we could all see it\" Drippy added. \"Look, I just came to tell you that whatever your planning, don't because its a waste of time, she will never return, she's happy back at home, I'm sure she's getting wasted or something as we speak and shagging the next guy she sees\" I snapped and walked away out of the room. Kate's POV \"Now what?\" Drippy asked. \"Don't you think its weird, that Poppy didn't send that email, that someone wanted to...hurt her? To make us hate her? I mean she actually started to like us, we were becoming friends, and the Poppy we knew would have fought an- \"What are ya trying to say Kate?\" Josie asked. \"If she really became attached to us, and the school, I don't think she would have set it on fire. I think-\" I paused for a moment and went over to my bed and picked up the emails and held them up facing the girls. \"I think whoever sent these emails was the one to set the fire, setting up Poppy like they set her up with these fake emails\" \"So now all we need to do is find out- The door opened and Matron walked in. \"Girls, bed now!\" she said and walked back out slamming the door behind her. \"I guess we'll find out tomorrow\" Drippy shrugged. \"First thing\" I told them. The next morning... We walked down to the dining hall where all the girls were standing of course waiting for the staff, and I couldn't help but notice how happy Harriet looked as we walked in, of course because we were minus one. I swear I would do anything to go over to her and wipe that smug look off the bitches face. Of course now she just thinks she can rule the school again in peace, and attain Freddie. I doubt Freddie would go for her though, he never went for before Poppy arrived, so why would he after she's gone?! \"Did you see her face?\" Drippy asked as we walked to our table. \"I think anyone can tell why she's happy to- \"Harriet! Of course!\" Josie yelled aloud. Harriet looked around and glared at her and started walking to our table. Great. \"Good morning ladies. Pleasant night? I assume so, now that the vermin American has gone am I right?\" Josie was about to mouth back but I beat her to it. \"Very pleasant\" I said with a fake smile plastered across my face. \"Well good, now I hope you girls don't make the same mistake she did, after all we all know she was a growing bad influence\" \"Of course Harriet, we are nothing like that...American\" I could feel Josie, Drippy, KiKi, and much to my surprise Freddie looking at me from the corner of my eye. \"Very well, I shall be off then\" Harriet said and left. \"What the heck was tha 'bout?\" Josie asked. \"Not now\"I whispered. \"You have seriously lost it mate if ya think for a second we are going to be chums with 'arriet\" \"Later\" I mouthed. Meanwhile in LA... Poppy's POV I sat alongside the edge of the pool just staring at the water. I couldn't put my mind into anything anymore. Its been a few days and all I can think about is Abbey Mount, and my life at Abbey Mount. My life was...complete there. \"Poppy where are you?\" Molly yelled. \"Out here\" She walked out and smiled. \"Are you ok?\" Listen to that, she feels like she has to take care of me now. I can't do that to her, I have to act normal again, and be her older sister, not have her treat me like the younger sister and feel like she has to take care of me. \"I'm fine Mollster, hey how about we put on a good chick flick and eat junk until we puke?\" I joked. \"Sounds fine and all but- \"But what?\" I asked. \"Ruby called, she said Ryan was having a party, and said to tell you to be there. Everyone's well, your Poppy Moore, there is no party without Poppy Moore\" she said a little sad. \"Well she's right, there is no party without Poppy-\" \"Have fun, I think I'll go to bed now\" she said sounding down, and then began to walk off. I got up and ran up to her and turned her around by her shoulders to face me. \"You didn't let me finish, of course there is no party without Poppy Moore, because I am the life and soul of a party, so that's why that party will suck without, because I am staying in, and staying up watching movies with my lil sis\" Her face lit up. \"Really?\" \"Of course, plus I am so over Ruby and the group\" \"Oh good, because I never liked her\" she said with a sigh of relief. I laughed. \"So, what do you want to watch?\" I asked. \"Oh how about Raise Your Voice? The one about the girl that goes to the summer music boarding sch-sorry\" \"It's OK\" I mumbled. But really it wasn't, I wasn't going to be happy until I was back at Abbey Mount.[Chapter 4] Chapter IV: Ideas No one's POV \"Hurry up will ya\" Josie sighed, she was getting tired of waiting. \"These things take time\" Kate said in Drippy's defense, who was working on the computer in the computer lab. \"Almost done\" \"Oh shit, Matron!\" KiKi yelled and ran over to sit next to Josie who was pretending to work, as she had put up a word document just in case anyone walked. The door opened and Matron walked in. \"Behind on your girls?\" she asked in suspicion. \"Yes, quite a lot actually. Never had the time with Poppy around\" \"Always a distraction, she was\" Matron said in agreement and then took one last look at the girls computer screens and left. KiKi looked outside the lab again to see if she was really gone. \"Clear\" she said but stayed there, just incase. \"Why do you got to always use Poppy's name Kate?\" Josie asked. \"Speaking of, like the way you talked about her to 'arriet\" \"Because while we try to clear her name, everyone has to think we still hate her\" she said in response as though they should have caught on, it was simple. \"Right\" \"I can't wait to swipe that smug look off of Harriet's face once we find out it was her\" \"What do ya mean? 'Arriet?\" \"Who out of the whole school hates Poppy so much, and would have done anything to get rid of her?\" Kate asked the girls. \"Yeah but if she ever got caught, she'd know she'd be thrown out- \"But no one has ever accused her, or even thought about accusing her, no one knows her like we do, now all we need is the pr- \"Your right Kate. It was Harriet, she sent the email, Poppy must have forgotten to log out, and she took the email and logged onto her own user-name and sent the email\" \"That's great! Now we can go to Mrs Kingsley and tell her, and then get ba- \"Your forgettin one fing Kate, she still started the fire. She got expelled rememba, she won't be 'llowed back in\" Josie told Kate and the girls, their happiness short lived. \"If Poppy was telling the truth about this, I'm sure she was telling the truth about the fire too. I don't think she started it\" Kate said sure of what she was saying. \"But we have no proof it was anyone else\" Josie reminded her. \"I have an idea\" Kate said with a smirk. The girls gathered up together as Kate went over her idea with the girls. Freddie's POV \"...and he's been moping about for the past few days like a girl\" \"I can hear you\" I snapped, lifting my pillow off of my head. Matthew, my mate rolled his eyes and sat on the edge of his bed. \"Look, she was just another chick, there will be plenty more mate\" I don't know want any other girl. I want-wanted Poppy, until she went and fucked things up, she had me fall for her and then she used me as her ticket out. But why do I still fucking care about her?! I should hate her! \"Matt leave it!\" But what about Kate and the others? They think she isn't in the wrong, so why was Kate talking shit about Poppy with Harriet? Girls! Could never undertsand them. One minute they are best friends the next they hate each others guts. \"...and all I'm saying is that there are some real good looking girls at Abbey Mount, so don't waste your time crying over a chick that ain't even there no more\" \"Maybe\" I replied, but I couldn't help but wonder why Kate had a sudden change of heart when talking to Harriet. \"And you can meet someone in 3 days time\" 3 days? What's he talking about in 3 days? Clearly he knew I was wondering what he was talking about as he continued after seeing my expression. \"Haven't you been listening to nothing I have been sayin? Abbey Mount and our school are having a masquerade ball, you know, the whole masks shit and all, and who knows who you'll meet right?\" \"Abbey Mount? How come my mum never told me this\" I muttered more so to myself, but he heard. \"Because she can also see what a dick head your being, moping about over this American chick. Now cheer up, in 3 days you'll meet miss right\" Meanwhile... \"Do you really think she'll see it our way?\" Drippy asked Kate, worried. \"I don't believe that Mrs Kingsley ever wanted to see her go either, she has to understand, I'm sure she will\" Kate said confident of herself. \"'Arriet won't be too happy if she finds out what were planning\" Drippy added. Josie turned on her. \"Who gives a shit about 'er?! Its her fault that Poppy got kicked out!\" \"Well, that we don't know of yet, however if Mrs Kingsley agrees to our idea, then the truth shall be unveiled\" Kate told her. \"Alright, then lets get to it already, I really need to go get my eyebrows fixed again\" Drippy sighed and she looked at her reflection in the pictures that were framed outside Mrs Kinsley's office. \"Ready?\" Kate asked the others, and they all nodded and she then knocked on the door. \"Come in\" Review please![Chapter 5] Chapter V: Memories A.N - OK, so this next part didn't happen in the movie, but miles89 added it. Hope ya like it! Flashback... \"I've been waiting for you trouble\" Poppy jumped and spun around and was surprised to see Freddie standing in the girls bathroom, especially this late at night. \"Freddie!\" She was shocked to see him there and so quickly opened the bathroom door to see if anyone was out and about outside the bathroom, but the coast was clear. She shut the door behind her. \"And you say I'm trouble?\" He gave her his signature smirk and she melted. \"What are you doing here?\" She asked. \"What? I'm not allowed to sneak away from my school to come and see my girlfriend?\" he laughed. \"You sneaked out...for me?\" She was clearly pleased. \"Your worth the trouble\" He walked over to her and pulled her into a hug, which she returned. When they parted they both looked at one another, Freddie leaned in, but Poppy back away, he looked taken aback. \"Whats wrong trouble?\" \"I...nothing, sorry\" He looked at her confused. \"Your not scared are you? Of getting caught? I mean you should be used to it\" he teased. \"No, of course not\" she lied and let herself into his arms again. Poppy's POV What is happening to me? He is such a soft dweeb, why am I feeling like this? I can't possible like him. I can't. So why did I freak when he looked me in the eyes and was about to kiss me? I have kissed him before, on our date, but why did I back away this time? \"Poppy?\" I looked up and he looked down at me and smiled. \"You know me, airhead\" I joked. He smiled, that made me catch my breath. Then he ran his one hand down my and cupped my face in his hand and kissed me gently, and I kissed him back, but this time it was stronger than ever, I felt more out of it, I felt as though...no, a kiss can't possible...no, stick to the plan Moore, he's your ticket out. We parted and he uttered those three words I dreaded to hear from his mouth. \"I love you Poppy Moore\" End of Flashback. Freddie's POV I keep thinking of that one night at Abbey Mount, I told her how I felt, I told her I had fallen in love with her, she probably laughed herself to sleep that night. Thinking I was a complete utter fool that I fell for her trap. So why am I still thinking that I saw some love in her eyes for me. That she too felt the same way. God, why can't I get over her! Why is she still tormenting me day and night?! Why is she doing this to m-shit! My phone, it was buzzing. I turned around and grabbed it off the side draw. \"Turn it off\" Matt muttered half asleep and turned around. I had gotten a message...from Kate? I opened the message up. Will u b at the Masquerade ball? We r hoping to c u! Kate Why does she care if I'm there or not? She must want to talk to me and convince me that Poppy was not at fault over the whole situation, but I read the email, and I found her lighter. End of. I guess I will have to wait 2 days now. Its going to be awful though, Harriet stalking me every chance she gets. Kate's POV We talked to Mrs Kingsley a little while ago. I was so scared; I didn't think she would even listen to us. But she did, she actually did. I have been at Abbey Mount for about 2 years now, so I know how it is being the new girl, but KiKi, Josie and Drippy were so welcoming, I guess that's why I decided to make the first step and actually try and have a real conversation with Poppy that day when she was sitting in our room, wet. I still don't actually know why she was wet, well that's beside the point. The point is I knew how she felt; she isn't the only one that was shipped off to a school. \"I cannot believe we did it, I can't believe Mrs Kingsley is going to talk to the other teachers and board members\" This great, its only a matter of a few days. \"I can't wait to see 'arriet's face\" Josie added. Flashback... \"Good morning ladies, how are you today?\" Mrs Kingsley asked as we entered her office. \"Very well Mrs Kingsley\" I replied and we all took a seat. \"Now, Drippy told me you had a serious matter to discuss with me, which is why she took this appointment with me. So, how may I help you girls?\" \"Its about Poppy\" She looked at us all curiously. I bet she is wondering why we want to talk about Poppy, after all we are supposed to hate her after those emails. Well, little does she know... \"I don't understand\" \"Then we'll make this clear Mrs Kingsley, Poppy is innocent\" Drippy told her. \"Innocent?\" \"Yeah, it means when- \"I know what it means Drippy dear, I just don't know what issue you are addressing her innocence on\" \"Drippy, shut up will ya? Let Kate do all the talkin!\" \"Girls\" \"Mrs Kingsley, before the fire we were good friends with Poppy, we began to see this girl that no one else could see, and then one day we found these emails attached to our dorm room door\" I started and handed her the emails, which she read. \"I never thought Poppy would hurt you gi- \"We did, and we feel ashamed about it\" I admitted. \"But you believe she didn't now?\" \"Yes, well that's all because of Drippy actually\" Mrs Kingsley's eyes then fell upon Drippy, who smiled. \"I figured it out after I went to go and get my 11 o'clock wagon wheel, which reminds me, it's almost 11 no- \"To the point Drippy\" Josie snapped. \"Right, well like I said, I was on my way to get my 11 o- \"DRIPPY!\" We all yelled. \"Alright, sorry. Anyway Mrs Kingsley as I went down, I passed the computer lab where Poppy was emailing some friends and I reminded her that she would be late for Freddie if she didn't- \"Freddie? What do you mean 'late for Freddie?'\" \"Oh shit\" Drippy mumbled and sunk lower in her chair. \"Maybe we should start from da beginnin\" Josie said. Mrs Kingsley seemed to be in her own thoughts for a moment, and then spoke. \"Yes Josie, from the beginning\" So I told her about how we were going to help Poppy get out of the school, about how we were going to use Freddie as her way out, and then I ended up finishing where Drippy left off and told how Poppy left the computer lab just after 11 and the emails were sent around 11.40am and how we found out the emails were written by Harriet, proving Poppy's innocence, and that leading us to believe we also don't think she started the fire, but Harriet did. \"Well, I'm glad you girls know Poppy was a good friend, as for Harriet I will ave some words with her, but hang on a minute, how did you find out Harriet sent the emails? Is there something else you should tell me?\" \"I sort of hacked into the computer system\" Drippy admitted. \"Oh girls, I am very disappointed, that was a terrible thing to do, even if it was to prove a friends innocence. But where the fire is concern- \"Mrs Kingsley, let Poppy back, let her prove her innocence, she was so down when she thought it was her fault that she never considered trying to prove her innocence, she just took the blame\" \"Girls, the honor court deci- \"Screw the 'onor court\" Josie snapped before she could stop herself. \"I mean, giv 'er a chance, please\" \"Its not just up to me, but I shall take in everything you told me, and will talk to the staff members, and board members\" \"Thanks Mrs Kingsley\" I said and we all got up to leave. \"Girls, no weekend outing this week for you, punishment for hacking into the school system\" None of us objected, we knew she would punish us in some way. But who cares? Poppy may be coming back! End of Flashback.[Chapter 6] Chapter VI: Differences No one's POV \"Poppy, can you come in here, we need to talk!\" Poppy heard her dad yell. She got up from the couch, turned off the TV and walked into the dining room to see her dad and step mum sitting down, she took a seat opposite them. \"What is it dad? Oh wait, let me guess, you found some other foreign boarding school that would except me? About time, I was wondering what was taking so long- \"Poppy\" he said in a stern voice. \"What?! That's what your going to tell me isn't it? That you found another school to ship me off t- \"What? Dad, I want Poppy to stay at home\" Molly cried. \"Mollster its OK, I'll probably get blamed for something I didn't do and get kicked out anyway,and be back before you- \"Actually, you're lucky some places are willing to give you a second chance\" he continued ignoring both his daughters. \"What do you mean?\" \"Abbey Mount, Mrs Kingsley rang, it seems that they are willing to give you another chance\" Poppy was speechless, Abbey Mount was going to give her another chance? But why?! Did they believe that the fire was an accident and that they took her word that she did put it out? \"I don't understand, I was expelled,how coul- \"You don't want to go?\" her father asked. She looked at him, was he saying that she now had a choice in the matter? \"No, I just-\" She was lost for words, loud mouth; obnoxious brat Poppy Moore was lost for words. She wanted to go back, but she wasn't sure if she would once again be accepted by those girls who she called friends, or that guy...Freddie, if he would forgive her, and except her once again. \"Poppy?\" \"I wanna go back dad. I have to go back\" Poppy sat on the edge of her bed as she was packing, she couldn't believe it. They were letting her back into the school and she was so happy, and excited, but she also wondered why. Who pleaded her case? It couldn't have been her friends, she laughed at that. She still believed them to be her friends; however they stop considering her a friend when they read that email, so how? Why? \"I'm going back mom, and this time I will make you proud\" she told the picture of her mom that she stared at from across the room. \"It will be different this time, I know it will\" That whole night Poppy couldn't sleep, she was too excited, it's all she could think about, tomorrow morning she would be on a plane back to London, back to Abbey Mount, the place where she felt at home, more so than her actual home, especially since she knew the attachment it had, her mother. * * * Kate sat up in bed, it was about 7am, and as they had a free period in the morning she knew the girls would skip breakfast and sleep, so she decided to take this time to go the computer rooms. No one would notice she would be gone, and even if they did they wouldn't expect her to be in the computer room. She took her phone out of the little side cupboard where she stashed her chocolates, and left the room as quietly as she could and headed for the computer lab, watching her back as she went. When she reached the room she got straight onto the computer and logged in and went straight to her email. She sighed; she still hadn't got a reply yet. It had been a week now she had been waiting for a certain email, which she still hadn't gotten. She sighed, and then remembered her phone, she took it out of her pocket and flipped it open and went down her phone book and pressed the call button. \"The number you are trying is currently unavailable\" She snapped her phone shut, annoyed and buried her head into her hands, and started crying. She didn't realise how long she was sat there until she felt a hand on her shoulder and she looked up, tears running down her face only to see Mrs. Kingsley. \"Kate, how about a nice cup of tea in my office?\" Kate didn't want to go, she just wanted to sit her in her own misery, but she knew Mrs. Kingsley would never let her. She knew this time, she would open up, and that meant letting people into her life. Half an hour later they were sat in Mrs. Kingsley's office, a cup of tea in her hand but Kate hadn't said a word, she stared at the time the whole time, she hadn't realized she had been in the computer lab for 2 hours. She wondered what the girls thought, were they worried, were they the ones to tell Mrs. Kingsley that they didn't know where she was? \"Hows the tea?\" \"Fine, thank you\" \"Kate, I'm not going to pressure you into telling me anything, however these past 3 years you've been here you have never really opened up. You always said you wanted to go to a boarding school, so here you are. But I am sure there is more to it\" \"I...I'd rather not talk about it\" Mrs. Kingsley watched Kate, she didn't look up, and she just stared at the cup in her hands. \"You're a very strong person. I have seen that, you're always the one to help the other girls, tell them right from wrong. If not me or any other teacher, they come to you for advice, they open up to you. But you're the opposite, no one has ever asked you what's on your mind, or how you're feeling, that's why you don't open up, but I'm going to try now. I want you to talk to me, about everything, and anything\" \"I don't expect people to ask me, they come to me for help, and I don't mind helping, but I did...do sometimes wish one of those people that come to me...ask me\" \"I'm asking you dear\" \"OK, here goes\" Flashback... 2 years ago... Kate's POV I watched my mother as she was on the phone, she was so excited, so happy. My brother Nate was coming home from University, his exams were over, and he was now set to graduate, well that's if he passes, but there's no doubt perfect Nate won't graduate. Oh and my other brother and two sisters. \"Kate! I don't want those plates, get the nice new ones. Your brothers and sisters are coming home; I want everything to be perfect\" I swore under my breath, I swear I feel like a damn maid! Just because they are all coming home we have to have the perfect dishes out. They aren't royalty-well for mum and dad, they are. Michelle is my older sister, she's about 29 and she's coming home with her now fiance Jake. Mum and dad were well chuffed when he proposed, he came down here and asked for their blessing first, mum cried because she was so happy. Of course they gave permission, Jake was 'perfect' for Michelle, 'the perfect couple' they are now in business together- a successful business, and a perfect home, blah, blah. Then there's Claire, she's 27 and she's been traveling, she works for some big firm in the city and she took a year out and decided to go traveling, mum and dad were pleased, 'she works herself too hard that girl' they say. Tony, 26 and is coming home from his job abroad. And then Nate, coming back from Uni. Dinner that night... We were all sitting down and everyone was talking, they were all excited, wedding plans here and there, travel pictures being passed around, a round of champagne for Nate, yeah, because he has already graduated right? He still had to pass, which he doesn't know if he has yet or not. I of course just listened to all the talks, no one notices me, it's always like that. I'm the daughter that doesn't really exist. Until I do something great, and really I won't, I won't be noticed by this family. I am not perfect, and I'm sure as hell they all have a few secrets too. In fact I guess I'm the rebel, there are things they don't know about me, things they will ne- \"...hey kid, Kate! You listening?\" I looked up confused, did I hear my name? \"Me?\" \"Yes you Kid\" Nate laughed. \"I'm not a kid\" I snapped. \"Kate, don't take that tone with your brother\" Mum snapped. \"It's OK mum. So Katey, how have you been? Getting good grades? You don't want to be the black sheep and go in the other dire- \"Well, her last grades weren- \"Well I'm sorry I can't be as perfect as you all! I'm sorry I can only manage bloody C grades!\" I snapped. Wow, that felt good, I have never snapped in front of my family. \"Kate! Tone!\" \"No, that's not fair! Mum, dad, you guys can't expect me to be just like the rest of them lot!\" I told them pointing at my older siblings. \"C's, that's not great is it?\" Claire mumbled. She has got to be kidding me! That is so like my family! \"That's unfair- The door bell rang and everyone went quiet and then dad got up to answer the door. All heads turned, and I couldn't believe it either when I heard the yelling between dad, and oh god. Dad came storming into the room with Daniel's mum, who looked pissed off. \"Kate, what the hell have you been up t- \"Oh, I know very well, as I just told you! She is going to ruin my son's life if she ends up pregnan- \"PREGNANT?!\" Mum yelled. \"Yes! Just ask her! My son made an appointment for the both of them, at the doctors, to find out if she is pregnant!\" \"You wha-your not? Are you insane?!\" My dad yelled. \"Did I actually get your attention? That's a first\" \"You did that to make a point?!\" \"No, of course not! I love him, he loves me, we made love- \"Your so young, and a baby on the way- \"I don't know that yet!\" \"Mum, dad, we cannot allow this to get out, imagine what will happen to our family's reputation\" Claire cried. A.N - Kate's family are a well known family, rich family, dad has a huge firm. All made up on miles89's part of course. \"That's all you guys care about! You don't care about m- \"I want her away from my so- \"Kate! Kate my mum will be here- Daniel stopped in his tracks, and shut up. He didn't realize his mum beat him to the house. \"Daniel, we are leaving- \"No! I need to talk to her parent- \"There is nothing to talk about! She will ruin your life- \"She will not ruin my life! If she is pregnant we will have this baby- \"The hell you will! And she is my daughter! I don't want you anywhere near her boy!\" my dad snapped. \"Oh don't worry; I will not let him ever see this...this girl...ever!\" I felt like the room was spinning, everyone yelling and fighting all over the place, Daniel mouthing that he loves me, and won't allow us to be separated, and then the worst. My dad suddenly couldn't breath, his right hand clutched over his heart. No, no, no- \"...and he had a heart attack, the family blamed me. My mum wouldn't even talk to me, let alone look at me. It was all my fault an- \"Did you fin- \"I wasn't pregnant. After that Claire found Abbey Mount, she told mum and dad to ship me off. And so I was shipped off here. Things have changed, I don't feel alone and like an outsider here, I love it here- \"But what do you do when you go home?\" \"I don't, I go to my grandmothers, and she still loves me- \"And so does your family\" \"Sure. But the point is, I was this screw up, I caused my dad to have a geart attack, and I- \"What about Daniel?\" \"We email, we still see one another when were on holiday, of course, no one knows\" \"Was that why you were in the computer lab?\" \"Yeah, waiting for his reply, I emailed last, but that was last week and I still haven't heard from him\" \"You know, if you just get together with your family and talk to them- \"No, no, its OK\" \"I can arrange for them to come down- \"Mrs Kingsley, thank you for the chat, but please. Don't, i'm fine now...I promise. I'm fine\" Hope you guys like it![Chapter 7] Chapter VII: Return No one's POV Kate walked around the school, the hallways were empty, this she was pleased about because she knew as soon as the bell rang, it would be the end of lessons for the day, and the girls will find her and ask her what happened, what was wrong, and where she was. For now she needed the space, she needed to clear her head, to think and wonder if she would tell the girls everything. \"Kate, what are you doing out here? You should be lessons young girl\" Matron asked as she walked down the corridor only to spot Kate in her own thoughts, wondering around, alone. \"Mrs. Kingsley knows why I'm not in lessons\" \"Right you are, be on your way then\" Kate just smiled and continued walking down the corridor. She then heard the bell and sighed, and decided she may as well head back to her room as that's the first place the other girls would come looking for her. \"Kate! God you had us worried, where av you been?\" Josie asked as soon as she saw the door open. She was sitting on her bed alongside the other girls, they were waiting for Kate to return to her room. \"I'm OK, I just wasn't feeling too well, so I was with \" she lied. She didn't know why, but she knew she didn't want to open up about her past...yet. \"And are you feeling better? Maybe a wheel will help you feel better?\" Drippy asked as she jumped off her bed to get out a wagon wheel from her secret stash. \"No Drippy, its fine, thanks\" Kate went and sat on her bed. She knew the girls didn't believe her when she said she was fine, but she had decided that if she had gone two years here with no one asking her about her life, and not having to open up, then they would drop it, and carry on like nothing happened. \"So, in a few hours, the princess of LA will grace us with her presence, and tomorrow, we shall reunite her with her prince. It will be so romantic, like in those movies, he'll see her, fall head over heels in love again, and forget the past\" Drippy said twirling around the room, and talking in a dreamy voice. \"Its been too quiet and too boring without her\" Kate added, smiling. The other three girls looked at one another pleased, for the moment Kate was in her own world, they were a little worried. But she seemed to be fine now. So they weren't going to ask anymore questions. They didn't think they would get answers anyway. \"Ya know da best 'art of 'er return, 'arriet\" smirked Josie. \"Its gonna be a long day girls\" KiKi sighed. \"I can't wait!\" Hours later, it was now about 10pm, the girls were on their way in the taxi to collect Poppy from the airport, and they were getting excited during the journey to the airport. \"She's gonna be sooo excited when she sees us! I can't wait! And look, I brought her a- \"Drippy! If ya say Wagon wheel one mo time, I swear I'll chuck ya out da car!\" Josie snapped. \"Well carbs and sugar may do her well. I mean she isn't the bitch she used to be right?\" Drippy laughed. \"Well your right about one thing, she isn't the bitch she used to be, but get real Drippy she will never do carbs and sugar\" KiKi told her. \"OK, can we forget about who she used to be, and her eating habits. Look were almost there!\" Kate said snapping them out of the conversation and looked out the window where she was pointing at the airport. \"Oh I can't wait!\" Once they got out of the taxi they all ran to the terminal in excitement. They couldn't wait to see her, especially because they knew she would be shocked to see them considering she left on bad terms with the girls. insisted they go, as Poppy would be pleased, she told them that Poppy knew nothing about their input in her return. \"Is that her- \"No!\" \"Oh that's he- \"NO!\" Josie snapped at Drippy who was sop excited she couldn't stop jumping up and down. \"All these Bloody Americans look the same, I feel dizzy looking at them all- \"We'll know when we see Poppy\" Josie informed her. \"Girls, looks who's here\" Kate said to them and they all looked at her and followed where she was pointing. They all turned and saw Poppy, she was looking around the terminal, most likely for whoever was supposed to pick her up. Kate looked at the others and they all nodded. \"Malibu moment girls, who are we?!\" they all said aloud in unison. Poppy's POV I can't believe what I am hearing! Kate, Drippy, KiKi, and even Josie, they are here! To come and get me from the airport! Omg!!!!!! I ran over to them leaving the guy who I totally paid to push my luggage trolley pushing the many bags I had. OK,so I may now know where my heart lies with friends and whatever else, but hey I'm still a girl, and that too a Cali girl. Us Cali girls love to shop. \"I don't freakin believe it!\" And I really can't. \"Well believe it\" Kate said with open arms and I hugged her first. \"I don't understand, you girls hate me. But you girls are here? Well at least the journey back won't be a bore\" \"We missed you too Poppy Moore\" Josie sighed rolling her eyes. \"Sorry, not making it all about me. Its just! OMG! Freaking hell!\" This is so freakin awesome, and yes weird, because the last time I saw them they hated me, and- oh well, they can explain all the facts later, but right now I just wanna catch up with them. \"This is major cool, I love you guys\" \"Yeah, yeah, nuff of the soppy shit mate, lets get going, don't wan' ya gettin in trouble first day back ri?\" \"Oh and we have major shopping to do! The masquerade ball is tomorrow after all. And Freddie awaits your presence\" I stopped in my tracks. \"Freddie?\"[Chapter 8] Chapter VIII: The Ball No one's POV Charlotte knew that Harriet would have a fit if she has heard about her return, but the way Harriet is happily going around talking about the ball that means she has no idea of her return. Charlotte knew she had to break it to her before its to late. \"Harriet, um have you heard what everyone's talking...talking abou- \"Of course I have Charlotte. The masquerade ball, and Freddie Kingsley will be there and this time there will be no vermin American to stop me getting him\" \"Poppy Moore is back\" Charlotte mumbled. \"Charlotte are you that foolish? She was kicked out for Christ sake\" \"Its true, she is back. I saw her return to her old roo- \"WHAT?!\" And without another word an angry and hysterical Harriet stormed out of her room to find out if what Charlotte had just told her was true or not. If she was to find out it was true she was not going to be very happy. Harriet walked as fast as she could, she couldn't believe this is true, and if it is true, she would go to the one place which would confirm whether this was true or not. As she went down the hallways she could hear the muttering, but again refused to believe it until she saw it with her own eyes. She reached the room and instead of knocking barged in and stood there in shock. Right before her eyes were all the girls, Kate, Drippy, Josie and KiKi, and then across the room Poppy Moore. \"YOU?! Ho...but how?\" she screamed. Poppy gave a mocking shrug. \"I guess this place couldn't last without me! It was only a matter of time until they came begging my way\" \"But...this is not right! You were expelled! Oh your going to ruin everything!\" Poppy laughed. \"Poppy Moore is back and better than ever, get used to it byatch!\" Harriet yelled various curses and then turned to the others girl. \"If you girls had anything to do with- \"Yeah righ' 'arriet, as if we wan'ed 'er back\" Josie snapped glaring at Poppy. \"We don't know how she did it, she must have paid her way back\" added Kate also giving Poppy a dirty look and turning back to Harriet. \"This is impossible, I am going straight to Mrs Kinsley right now\" Harriet snapped and headed towards the door. \"Good luck\" teased Poppy. \"Ugh!!!!\" As soon as she left the girls all looked at one another and burst into laughter. That was too easy, having Harriet believe that all the girls were against Poppy was just the beginning. If they were going to find out that Harriet had gotten Poppy kicked out in the first place then this game was what they were going to play to find out. \"Well girls I think that went quite well\" Kate said. \"Yeah, she took that very well\" joked Poppy. \"So, how about we start getting ready for tonight's ball\" All the girls then got out their dresses and accessories whilst Poppy sat on her bed, she wasn't sure if she should go tonight, after all Freddie was going to be there, and she wasn't forgiven, despite the girls protests about Freddie wanting to see her, and that he still loved her she knew they were only saying so to make her go. She knew they were planning something to get them together again, but she had a bad feeling about tonight. * * * Freddie was not looking forward to tonight, being back in Abbey Mount brought too many painful memories back for him. Despite going there a few times since she left he always felt the same way when he went there. He hated it. Freddie walked back to his dorm room only to find the room a complete mess. \"What the hell is going on here?\" Matt walked in just after him and laughed. \"Well if you weren't so caught up in your lame love drama you woulda heard that Tobey, you know our room mate. The one who has the o- \"I haven't been that out of it! I know who he is\" Freddie muttered. \"If ya say so. Anyway mate, he was always a quiet one, the quiet ones are the worst. He was caught with an ounce of dope, got kicked out. This shit all across here most likely belongs to our new room mate\" \"Great, well make sure he gets this place cleaned up before we leave to- \"Don't worry, I will mate\" Both Freddie and Matt turned around and saw their new room mate standing in the door way carrying a box with his stuff. \"Thanks. I'm Freddie by the way\" Freddie said holding out his hand which the guy took. \"Daniel\" \"And I'm Matthew, but don't ever call me that. Its just Matt mate\" \"Alright. So are you guys cool about me being your new room mate? Its just I transferred, and- \"From where?\" Freddie asked. \"Oh well, I went to a public school and- \"And you wanted to come to some lame boarding school?\" Matt asked. \"I got myself expelled, it was the only way\" he shrugged. Freddie and Matt looked at one another curiously. \"Only way?\" \"My girlfriend goes to Abbey Mount and- \"Oh geez mate, not another bloody love sick room mate\" \"Another?\" he asked curiously. \"No, no way am I getting into this with you to pussies, I'm out of here. I'll be back later to get ready\" Matt sighed and walked out the room. Daniel looked at Freddie curiously. Freddie sighed and told him his story and then Daniel told Freddie his. \"So whats this girls name mate?\" Freddie asked. \"You think you may know her?\" Daniel asked and Freddie just shrugged. \"Kate\" Freddie turned to Daniel, he was shocked. Daniel just told Freddie his story about his girlfriend, his grilfriend who was sent to Abbey Mount, thought she got knocked up, their parents not allowing them to be together. It was all Kate. \"Yeah...I know her\" Freddie mumbled. \"Shit\" Daniel turned to Freddie. \"Don't tell anyone that, I'm sure Kate hasn't, and here I have gone telling some guy I have know for 20 minutes my life story-\" \"Don't worry mate. I'm not going to say anything\" Later that night... The ball started at 7pm, hardly anyone showed up at that time, unless you count teachers, and Harriet of course. However it was now 8.30pm and there were a lot of people there already, all in their masks and beautiful outfits. Freddie was standing in a corner with Daniel who couldn't contain his excitement. \"Its been ages mate since i've seen her, and now I can see her almost all the time now\" \"Yeah...sure\" was Freddie's usual reply. Freddie didn't want to be here, and he especially didn't want to be here when Kate arrives because then all the girls would pester him about Poppy and he didn't want that tonight. \"Yo mate, come onto the dance floor. There are plenty of hot ladies going around\" Matt said as he came down to them with a drink in hand. \"Your willing to share are you?\" laughed Freddie. \"Well...OK no, find your own chick, and when I say find your own chick that doesn't include searching for that Moore girl who isn't here- \"I am not searching for her! I don't care about her, OK?\" Freddie lied. Trying to forget her was hard, he didn't want to forget her, but he didn't want to love her anymore. \"Yeah, whatever. Well i'm off, I got a couple of girls waiting for me\" he said with a wink and left. Poppy's POV Even this black mini I am wearing isn't cheering me up. Usually it does, especially because it was the last at Burberry and I got it before Ruby the bitch could get her hands on it, but I have to say I am so loving the eye mask, black lace and swaroski crystals all around the edges, a gift...from myself. I got one for all the girls from LA and what a coincidence they match their dresses. So anyway I like had a run in with Harriet before, again, this was after she had come back from seeing Mrs Kingsley and she just yelled and said some things, usually what she says doesn't bother me, she talks shit all the time. But when she mentioned Freddie and how he hates me, she knew she got me there. \"Oh come on Poppy mate, forget wha' 'arriet said, k?\" \"Be honest guys, does he hate me?\" I asked. The usual answer I got was \"he loves you, we know it, and you know\" but when they would say it they couldn't face me, which tells me he doesn't anymore. Or he hates me. \"Shall we get going?\" Kate asked the girls. \"Lets get this show on tha road\" Josie said rolling her eyes, but she couldn't help but smirk. We made our way down, it wasn't the same entrance as we made at the dance last time, but I totally prefer keeping myself on the down low, Poppy Moore on the DL right? I know so not possible right?! \"So girls, how about we show these people here how to really party?\" \"What are we waiting for then?!\" Kate laughed and we all grabbed one another's hands and rushed to the dance floor, flo rida low started and we let the music totally take us and we were dancing like no other that people started to stop and just stare. OK, so what happened to staying on the DL? I don't know, I guess the music totally took me away. What can I say? I'm a Cali girl, I love a good party. No one's POV \"Mate you gotta check out those girls on the dance floor. I would kill to get in there with them\" Matt said as he rushed over to Freddie and Daniel. \"No\" was both their blunt answers. \"Too bad, come\" Matt said and dragged them down to the dance floor, but that's when the music hit a slow track. \"Shit, your luck is bad\" Matt teased. Freddie rolled his eyes and made his way back to the table he was sitting at. When he turned to take a seat he noticed that Daniel stayed behind with Matt, poor guy. \"K...Kate?\" Kate froze as she was walking away with Poppy as they were the only two who hadn't found a guy to slow dance with. \"Kate?\" Poppy looked over her shoulder and saw the guy standing alone practically in the middle of the dance floor, then she turned back to Kate. \"Go over and dance with the guy!\" \"No, I don't really- \"Go on!\" Poppy urged and turned her around and pushed her over to the guy. \"Daniel?!\" Kate cried and hugged him instantly. Poppy however looked confused, how does she know him?! \"Uh, am I totally missing something here?\" Poppy asked. \"Oh...sorry, Poppy this is Daniel my boyfriend, Dan this is P- \"Poppy Moore, I've heard a lot about you\" Poppy's POV Well, I haven't heard shit about this guy. OMG! She is so not in our nunnery! OMG! KATE! KATE! OMG! She never freaking told you-wait a second. I turned and then saw the happy couple dancing but broke it apart and turned on Daniel. \"What do you mean you've heard about me?\" \"Shit\" he muttered. \"Shit? Shit is all you have buddy? Talk now!\" \"Freddie, he;'s my room mate and he- I slowly backed away and ran from the dance floor. Freddie? He told Daniel about us? What exactly did he tell Daniel? No one's POV Freddie wanted to kill himself, he was sitting alone until Harriet had come over and started shamelessly flirting with him, she hadn't mentioned Poppy's return once, but why would she?! \"Look Harriet- oh look my friend is waiting, it was good seeing you again- \"Oh Freddie, save me a dance would you?\" she asked batting her eyelashes. \"Of course...Harriet\" He rushed away as fast as he could only to bump into someone almost knocking them but at the last second caught them in a dip. He looked right into the girls eyes and knew, he knew right then who it was and without thinking, he dropped her stepped back and walked away. Drippy and Josie who had witnessed this came rushing over and crouched down beside Poppy who had tears streaming down her face. \"He hates me\" Ok, harsh that Freddie dropped her, but have you ever been in a situation where your in such shock you dont know how to handle it?! Cause I have, and Freddie was just unsure of it all and just dropped her without realising. lol.[Chapter 9] Chapter IX: New Plan Freddie's POV She's back, she is actually finally back. God what am I gonna do, wait why am I wondering this, I don't need to care about this, or her. I should just leave- \"Freddie!\" I don't need her to lecture me, or tell me to talk to her or anything- \"Freddie please wait\" I stopped and turned around. \"What is it Kate?\" She glared at me, she looked pretty pissed off. I'm not surprised, I mean I dropped Poppy in the middle of the dance floor, not intentionally, and I do feel bad about it but I really don't need to hear anything right now. \"How could you drop her and then have the nerve to walk out- \"I didn't mean to drop her, I was in a state of shock, I just reacted. I didn't mean it\" I mumbled, not even being able to look her in the eyes. \"You must be feeling bad, because you snapped at me when I just called your name and now you can't even look me in the eyes\" she said, and it was true. \"I know and I'm sorry. I...I don't know how I feel anymore Kate, I love her I don't want to, but I do. But she used me, took advantage of my love and used me\" I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to address any of this anymore. I wanna talk to her and give her the benefit of the doubt, but then again do I really want to go over this again and again?! I turned to look at Kate. \"Look, I just...I'm gonna head off\" \"Head off? Freddie you have to talk to her please!\" No, not right now. I can't deal with it right now. I walked off ignoring Kate who was yelling me to stop; I just had to get out of there. I can't believe they set that all up. What did Kate and the others think, I would just fall for her all over again, forgive her for messing me about? That's not how these things work. Back inside the dance... Poppy's POV I guess I'm not totally forgiven by everyone. This totally sucks because I really do like him and I totally fucked things up and he will never talk to me ever. \"Come on Poppy, lets get you out of here\" Kate said and I got off the chair. \"I can go back alone, plus don't you wanna say goodbye to your boyfriend. He's hot, you have explaining to do girl, and we will be waiting for all the debts\" Kate blushed and headed off to Daniel who was in the corner waiting for her. She can be so clueless about guys, I guess I need to fill her in, I mean she really was gonna come back to our rooms with us? She is totally crazy, especially considering she has this hot guy waiting for her, and she wanted to ditch him for us? I mean OK, she's totally an awesome friend, but hell I would totally fucking choose Freddie over the girls, and they fucking know it. We walked out of the hall and slowly made our way out, but then I realized the girls weren't right behind me. I turned around and didn't see them. Now where the hell have they gone? \"Drippy! Josie! KiKi! Where are yo- \"Poppy keep it down will ya\" Josie yelled in whisper. I looked around confused. \"Where are you guys?\" I couldn't see them anywhere. Damn the dark night. \"Over here by the bushes!\" she snapped. I ran over and the pulled me behind the bushes. \"Ew I just fucking stepped in the mud, ew lets go!\" I tried to leave but Josie held onto me. \"What?!\" \"We got a plan\" Plan? What sort of plan? I don't like the- \"Were gonna go over to Freddie's school\" We what?! Oh God, look what I've done to these girls. Rule breaking and- well OK, I admit I kinda like it, but whoa, I cannot get kicked out yet again. \"Guys I don't know if- \"What happened to ya Poppy? Don't go all Harriet on uz\" Ew, like that could ever happen. \"So...what's the plan?\" Damn the devil in me! The girls looked at me, smirking. This was gonna be a long night. Review please[Chapter 10] Chapter X: Getting In Poppy's POV They have now involved Daniel, he is our lookout. All Kate had to do was give him a soppy lovesick look and he gave in. Now I really need to talk to Kate when this is over, there really is more than meets the eye with her. This is so cool, a secret Kate. And she tried to get all good girl on me and stuff, OMG I can't wait to get her to spill, and if she doesn't, well I can always get her drunk or somethin- \"...is clear\" \"Poppy mate! Poppy!\" Huh? \"Oh right, what?\" \"Danny said- \"Danny? You have serious explaining to do later,\" Josie whispered to her. Kate flushed. \"Yeah...so- hang on he's calling again\" We've been outside the boys' school for about half an hour, its now like midnight. Its not the time I really give a shit about, I mean I'm not one for a bedtime, but like I just got back into Abbey Mount, if anyone knows we're missing...well we're totally gonna be in loads of shit. Well, unless I get Freddie back it was all worth it. \"...OK, well I don't know. Just get him outside- I don't know Danny! Just do it-oh for the love of-fine, well I guess we'll have to get her in your room\" Get who in who's room? Oh shit. \"Wait, I'm gonna have to go to his room?\" Hmmm well, I guess I can see how Freddie lives and well I am going into his bedroom right?! \"You have one dirty mind Poppy Moore, you 'aven't even got back wit him yet and your finkin about getting into his bed?! You have one dirty mind Moore\" I was so not thinking-OK so maybe I was. Maybe. \"So how am I getting into his room\" \"Eager much\" Josie mumbled. I turned to her and smirked. \"Well if being shut in his room alone with him is how I can talk to him...well I guess I have to endure the long hours of the night that way\" \"Oh yeah, you have to endure it, its gonna be torture alright\" Josie said rolling her eyes. \"We girls ready?\" I asked. \"Yes, Danny told his other room mate to leave for the night, made up some excuse, and will be here in a few minutes to get you to his room and- \"What about you guys?\" \"No 'ffence mate, but whatever you and Freddie get up to...well I doubt think you wanna share\" Josie said with a wink. I totally blushed. Then again I don't know why I am blushing, I mean he totally hates me and I am thinking way too far ahead as though I will walk into his room and all will be forgiven and he'll hold me in his strong arms and kiss me...with his soft lips on mine making me melt further into his ar- \"Poppy\" ...arms and it will just be the two of us, no one but just us. All will be forgiven, and then we will only have the worry of finding out who set me- \"Poppy!\" Huh? Oh right, shit. \"Sorry I just-\" \"For Christ sake stop finkin of 'im when you're 'bout to see 'im!\" Josie snapped. \"Right, so what's the plan again?\" They girls sighed, its not my fault I am totally zoned out, I mean I have to make things right with Freddie again. \"Danny's here get goin already!\" \"Right, so you guys are cool to cover for me?\" \"We have it all planned, don't worry now go\" Josie snapped. I turned to walk off but stopped in my tracks sighing and turned back to face the girls. \"I can't go yet, Kate seems to be having a what would you guys say snogfest with Danny over there\" \"Oh gross, Kate for fucks sake you look your eating one another's faces!\" Josie snapped in disgust. They finally broke apart, Kate was blushing, her arms still around dear Danny's neck. It makes me sick…with jealously of course! Duh. That should be and Freddie and may well b- \"For Christ sake, get goin!\" \"Right sorry, I'll see you later guys, and umm see you this weekend Kate\" he said with a smile and then walked off to see if no one was around. I said bye to the girls around me and left after Danny. We walked around to the side entrance where he told me that no one really checks this entrance, at least that's what Matt and Freddie had told him. Matt is great at sneaking out so they know the routes to get out. \"Hold on, let me see if the corridor is empty\" he said once we reached his corridor. He left me for a few moments and then returned. \"The coast is clear, come on\" I followed him down the dark corridor. Then he stopped in front of a room which of course I knew was his room, Freddie's room. \"My mission was to get you to his room, what happens next is between you and Freddie\" he said and then left. \"Thanks Daniel, I know you can get into shit for this\" I watched him leave and then turned to the door, just as I was about to knock the door swung open and there before is Freddie. Shit. He looked at me as though he was ready to slam the door in my freaking face, but then he surprised me. He stepped outside and ushered me into the room, closing the door behind him.[Chapter 11] Chapter XI: Forgive 'n' Forget Freddie's POV I heard voices outside the room and got up to go and check who it was, until I heard the voices. \"My mission was to get you to his room, what happens next is between you and Freddie\" I heard Daniel say. Get who to my roo-no, impossible. \"Thanks Daniel, I know you can get into shit for this\" I paused at the door, not sure whether I should open it or not. Or just wait for her to knock and then open it, or not open the door at all. Taking a deep breath I opened the door to see her standing there, I'm sure she was just about to knock. I stepped aside to let her in and then closed the door behind me. I looked around my room, shit the guys have left it a mess, and damn Matt and his posters, she's gonna think we are such…well guys. Maybe before she notices how messy my stuff is around my bed I could shove it without her notice-wait why do I care what she thinks. I leaned on the door and took another breath and then looked her in the eyes. She was standing there, staring at me…but me then my mess, well and the guys mess. \"You can get kicked out for this if you get caught trou-Poppy\" I guess using that word, that name I called her to tease isn't the name I would call her now, considering I don't know if right now the time where we can start actually is being another apart from fri-well not even friends. \"I had to see you\" she mumbled. Well, that's not like Poppy is it now? Mumbling, that's a new one. The Poppy we all know is a loud-mouth heartbreaking brat who only thinks about herse- \"Freddie could we just talk, starts over and talk this throu-\" \"Talk what through?! How you used me? Or...or how you almost burnt the school down and don't even get me started on those emails- \"They weren't written by me, well not all of it. It was mostly exaggerated and-\" Now I just got mad. \"And what Poppy? You think that this is all so fuckin simple that the girls forgave you so I have to forgive you too! Do you really think I can forgive you for making me fall in love with you only to have it thrown back in my face?! They may have been OK with you using them the way you did but I sure as hell am not!\" There, I said it. I told her how I feel, how she made me feel I hope now she knows the mess she left behind. The lives she hurt, mine especially. \"I know and I'm like really sorry, but you have to hear the rest you have to hear me tell you that I love you!\" I laughed. \"Love me? You call that love do you?\" \"No, of course not but I just-I wanted to get out so bad-\" \"And yes, I was your damn ticket out! No need to remind me what I already know!\" I couldn't look at her anymore and turned bitterly away. \"Freddie I made a mistake, a bad mistake. But you have to know when I kissed you I realised I found a reason to stay and...\" she went on. (A.N - In bold will be Freddie's self arguing with himself not to get back with Poppy, and normal writing will be to get Poppy Back) I was a reason she wanted to stay back? She still used you, how do you know she won't do so again? She sounded like she was serious, she is sorry. Yeah now, until she does it again. Why would she do it again? You call her trouble for a reason, and once she is in it again she'll have you bail her out of course. Me? How? Your mother. No, Poppy wouldn't- What happened to hating her a minute ago? That's before I saw her, and fell in love with her all over again. You're only going to have your heart broken again. I think...I'll take the risk. \"...and they won't do anything about Harriet until we have proof she started the fir-\" I stopped her talking all if a sudden, because without planning it, without thinking I had her pinned against my bedroom wall in a kiss. When we broke apart we just stared at one another. \"You're too much trouble\"[Chapter 12] Chapter XII: Oops Freddie's POV God she really is trouble, I mean a few kisses, which ok could have lead to something and I get called to the heads office, and not even my heads office, but to my mum at Abbey Mount. She has been pacing up and down behind her desk, she hasn't looked at me since I was brought to her school, and well now to her office. She's already spoken to Poppy though I don't know what she said, and I really hope she didn't kick her out...again. She sighed, not a good start but she knows me I am her son after all she knows we wouldn't... I wouldn't, at least not at school- \"Freddie this is a serious matter\" I know that. \"Right so whats-\" \"Whats going to happen, she said cutting me off, is your banned from weekends off, and from coming down to Abbey Mount for two months\" Two months? Its not even about being banned from just coming to this school to see mum, its more about Poppy. \"Do you not approve of Poppy mum?\" I asked. \"This isn't about her darling, and she has received her punishment too, no weekends out and she will receive two months detention\" \"Mum this punishment is going to drive us apart\" I can't allow that to happen, especially since I caved in and let her know I still care. \"Sweet heart Poppy is here because she wants to be here, and I cannot give her many chances and since we still have yet to prove that H-someone else was involved with the fire, she is walking on thin ice with the board members and therefore I think the time apart will be better so she can adapt to being an Abbey girl again\" I guess I should give Trouble her space, but-hang on- \"Prove who did what?\" She head snapped up and she looked at me and then sighed. \"I don't believe Poppy started the fire, just like we know now she didn't send those emails\" \"So who do you thi-wait Harriet made those emails, so that means, I couldn't believe it, she started the- \"We have no proof Freddie so I think until we do you and Poppy shouldn't keep so close in case that is another reason for her to do something else, if she was the one who started the fire in the first place\" Poppy's POV It totally could have gone worse. Mrs K could have totally told me to stay away from Freddie but she didn't and I should be used to the detentions, I'm sure I totally broke some Abbey Mount records especially when I got detention first day here when I started this place almost a year ago. The door flew open and the girls came running into the room and jumped on my bed. \"Hey! You girls are totally going to have to do my bed now, look at the wrinkles you'll create on the bedshee- \"Oh give it a rest Poppy, we only just 'eard, you and Freddie got caught\" Josie said, all the girls looked at me in wonder. I shrugged who cares, I mean I knew that it totally wasn't a safe plan but hey the situation before his heads arrival was...well he had me pinned up against the wall, we were alone in fact I think if we weren't interrupted...well lets just say if we had a few more minutes alone I wouldn't be a part of the nune- \"For fucks sake, where is 'our 'ead at?\" I snapped out of my thoughts. \"Oh I don't know Josie, I think maybe the grin on her face tells us she is reminiscing about last night and what happened...or correct me if i'm wrong, what could have happened\" Kate said to Josie as I tried to think of an excuse. \"Ya mean you guys...ya know?\" Josie asked. \"We totally could have if it weren't for his head- \"Oh my days, Poppy Moore would 'ave been the first to break out of our nunnery\" Josie laughed. \"Hmm, I don't think I'll be the first, I think someone has already left our...\" I trailed off realizing I spoke out loud. All the girls looked at one another in surprise, come on how can it really be such a surprise I mean haven't they seen the way Kate and Daniel are when together, seriously are they bli- \"Wh-Drippy?!\" Josie asked Drippy in shock. \"Me? Yeah right, I'd be so lucky if a guy even looked at me\" she sighed. \"Well it ain't you so-KATE?!\" Kate stepped off my bed and headed to her own bed, but before I could stop her Josie followed and sat on the end of Kate's bed determined to get it out of her. \"Well? Why'd ya keep us outta da dark?\" she demanded to know. Kate who usually had like an answer or comeback for everyone sat there, speechless with nothing to say. \"Come on mate, spill. You and Daniel right?\" \"Could we please leave my personal life?\" Kate asked. \"But- \"Ok\" I said before Josie had the chance to protest. \"But she always said she was-\" Josie started until I threw my pillow at her. She threw the pillow aside and then glared at me. \"Wha'? I was jus' askin' 'er, I mean we are suppose' to be friends! You would tell us if ya fucked Freddie\" True, they are my girlfriends, they would be the first to know- \"Ya would, I know it\" she said as if she totally read my mind. I looked at Kate who wasn't looking at anyone, I guess she really must have fucked up bad her first time, hmm maybe OMG! It totally wasn't with Daniel so like she doesn't want to remember. \"I'm...gonna go for a shower\" Kate mumbled and grabbed her towel and clothes and walked out the room.[Chapter 13] Chapter XIII: Reality Check Poppy's POV OK so last term I was busy trying to get myself out of this place so I was kept busy, but what the hell is a girl to do now that its not only been like two days since I've seen Freddie and its like a weekend or whatever and I can't even go to the lame town. I mean I'd take the town than sitting here doing nothing like any day. \"You ain't even gonna try and get out r ya?\" Josie asked. \"You know I can't or I'll totally get kicked out for sure. You know breaking the rules and shit\" I sighed. \"Wow, 'ho woulda fought, Poppy Moore won't be breakin 'ny more rules\" Josie teased. \"Oh except for when ya got 'aught in Freddie's school\" \"The reason I'm here, but hey I got him back didn't I?\" Oh yeah, I totally did. \"It doesn't matter anyway, Poppy will be here trying to figure out how to get Harriet to confess, or how were going to get her back\" Kate said as she walked into the room. \"What, do you have some sort of mind reading shit going on? How did you know what we've been talking about?\" Kate laughed. \"I was only outside the door…with Mrs. Kingsley\" I rolled my eyes, I mean OK she is being totally cool with me and all that but seriously is she now checking up on me? \"I know what you're thinking, but she's not checking up on you because she doesn't trust you, she's checking because she cares Poppy, we all do\" \"Sure whatever\" Josie and Drip's and myself have been acting like nothing happened a few days ago when Josie tried to get Kate to talk about her relationship with Daniel, and for now its seem to have been forgotten. \"Your not ready yet Kate? Why no'?\" Josie asked. \"Oh, I'm not going, have to catch up on some work for…French\" Josie looked at me and sighed, but Kate didn't notice. Kate has totally been anti-social since like that day Jose totally grilled her. \"Righ' well I'll see you girls later, have to get Drippy outta da freezer\" she said rolling her guys, grabbing her bag and then leaving. As soon as she closed the door behind her I waited a few seconds and then ran to the door and opened it. Josie was gone. I walked back in and closed the door behind me. \"OK, you don't have French work and like I'm def not gonna pressure you and all that shit, so if you want to talk then you totally can\" I told Kate. Kate looked at me for a moment and then sighed. \"You're not the only one that was sent away because your parents wanted you to be straightened out\" Wait, is Kate admitting to being messed up? \"You wanna talk about it?\" \"I'm the black sheep of my family\" she blurted. \"I had a pregnancy scare which- \"WHAT?\" Oops. \"I mean, wow Kate I'm sorry-\" She held up her hand and cut me off to continue. \"My parents, my family they expected better from me, they wanted me to be like my all so perfect brothers and sisters. They hated Daniel, and thought AM was the place to send me off, to get rid of me\" I just noticed she had tears in her eyes. I went over to her bed and hugged her as she cried on my shoulder. \"And I thought I had it bad with that stupid step mother of mine\" Kate released herself from the hug and sat up on the bed. \"AM is my home, and has been for the past two years. Daniel, how he got to Freddie's school is a miracle, and now we can finally be together\" \"I'm so happy for you now\" and really I am. Poor Kate, all the things she had to go through. \"I'm sorry Kate, for putting all my shit on you, and you've been dealing with your- \"shit\" she laughed. \"Yeah, sorry\" \"I haven't been able to tell the girls\" she said shaking her head then adding \"not because I don't trust them, its just I think you can get me more, coming from a background where you felt like you messed up- \"Well I messed up intentionally, you didn't, so your still a better person than I am\" I admitted to her. \"You're a great person Poppy Moore, and I know your smart and all, but can I give you some advice?\" \"Sure\" I shrugged. \"Make sure you are really really ready, you know to go all the way with Freddie. I see the way you look at one another and I can tell you that's how Daniel and I were, but looked what happened, we were separated for a while. Just make sure he is the one, OK?\" * * * Freddie's POV What am I supposed to do, all alone in my room. Daniel is in the library working, catching up on stuff he has missed considering he is a transfer, and Matt is God knows where doing what or doing who. I turned on my bed and smiled as I picked up a little picture up, of the two us. Maybe I could see Poppy, maybe I can go down to Abbey Mount on the excuse to see mu-oh damn I can't even do that, I'm not allowed. Well at least this gives me the time to plan the perfect date for when I see her once again, and maybe is she does feel the way I do, we could finish what we started. I know Poppy is the one…the one I want to lose my virginity to, because I love her. She's the one I want to go all the way wit- \"Hey man-oh sorry interrupting something between you and Poppy's picture am I?\" Daniel joked as he walked into the room and set his bag down. \"Very funny, I was just thinking about how much I love her\" I admitted. Daniel didn't say anything and just nodded and then started taking his books out of his bag. Ok something is wrong. \"Dan, what's wrong?\" I asked. \"You love her, I think we all know that however just don't rush into anything\" he said quietly, his back still facing me. \"What do you mean?\" He sighed and turned around and sat on the edge of his bed opposite me. \"I love Kate and when we…you know, we were ready, what we weren't ready for was what could have come along with it, we didn't think things through and we had…a pregnancy scare\" I sat there in shock, he is talking about Kate right? \"But you don't regret it, and I know I will never regret my first time, especially if it's with Poppy\" I told him. \"Yeah I guess, but…never mind\" \"No, go ahead tell me\" \"I've never done it with her again after that, I ruined things for her with her family and if this time we did it she got pregnan-look all I'm saying is that you shouldn't go for it unless she tells you first that she wants to go for it, just…just in case\"[Chapter 14] Chapter XIV: New Twist Freddie's POV I have had Daniel's words in my mind for the past few hours, I can't believe Kate had a pregnancy scare, at least that's what I think, it makes the most sense. He cut himself off when he realized he said too much but the whole pregnancy makes the most sense. I wonder if Poppy knows anything, and if she does will it scare her away? But wait, what am I saying, even though I believe, actually I know we could have gone all the way would it have been because I was leading the way, and because I was she followed my lead? All I keep thinking about is what could have happened, how stupid am I to keep thinking about something that I was/am reading for, but never knowing whether she was ready. I lay back on my bed and just stared at the ceiling thinking about Poppy. I wonder what she's doing, I wonder if she's missing me the way I am missing her. I heard the door open and looked to my right to see Daniel walk in, he looked at me and sighed but didn't say anything, but I knew he wanted to say something, and it was coming, no doubt. I could tell he was playing for time, as he started putting his washed clothes away and then clearing his desk, putting his books in neat piles and all that. Then he opened up his laptop on his desk and then slowly turned around on the chair. \"Don't take what I said too hard, I mean who am I to say anything, don't let it discourage you if you and Poppy are you know…ready\" he said and then turned to face his laptop again. I didn't respond, I didn't know if I should ask him about his experience, or even tell him what I think almost happened the other day when Poppy and I were alone in here together. \"Something…at least I think something could have happened between me and Poppy the other day\" I told him as he was typing away. Then I heard the typing stop, clearly he is surprised by what I just told him. He sighed and then said \"until you got caught right?\" he didn't even turn around. \"Yeah, and before you said what you said thinking about that day made me realise I was ready, because I love her and I know love is enough\" I am sure of it. \"But?\" \"Well I just thought after you talked to me that- \"What if you weren't ready and just got caught up in the moment right?\" \"No, now don't interrupt me. I realized that I was ready, but what if she just went along with it and she wasn't ready\" \"You guys haven't talked since that day right?\" \"Right\" \"So I think you guys just have to talk about what happened, or what could have happened next time you see one another\" \"Yeah…yeah I guess your right\" * * * Poppy's POV Kate has gone for a walk, to clear her head but she told me she feels great because she could finally share her secret with someone and I'm totally glad I could be there for her, I mean I totally owe her for always saving my ass and I wouldn't even be back if it weren't for her and the girls. However let me tell you usually when someone gives me some advice I ignore, only because well I go by my own rules, but she mentioned love and when I'm ready and all that and its totally got me thinking, yes thinking, and I mean really thinking...about Freddie and that day. I buried my face in my pillow. \"oh Freddie!\" \"What was that?\" I heard a laugh and turned over on my back and saw Kate. \"Nothing, you OK?\" She gave a me a smile and nodded. \"So, what was that you were saying?\" I sighed, she totally gets me. \"I was thinking of Freddie and how we almost could have…DONE IT!\" I shrieked and she jumped. Oops. \"Wow, I…wow. How? When?\" she asked trying to sound like she hadn't just gotten a shock. \"That day, but then his stupid teacher came and I don't even know whether we were going to, I mean was he really going, were we going to…I mean really? Or am I over analyzing what went down? Maybe he didn't want to, I mean we only just got together again, and I am totally not that bitch Ruby who will jump into bed with anyone so like the way I was feeling had to be totally real he must have totally felt it too we were so totall- \"Poppy! Calm down and a take a breath, all I got was 'totally' like 5 times and something about 'Ruby bitch' or something. Who's Ruby?\" \"Oh just this bitch I knew\" \"And she's got to do with this how?\" \"Ignore I mentioned her\" I said. She looked at me confused and then dropped it. \"So about Freddie?\" \"I think we totally would have done it the other day, but I don't like know if he's…you know done it before because I'm like a total nun\" \"Well next time you meet, you guys have to talk about what happened\" \"Yeah…buts that ages away\" * * * No ones POV The girl sat at her desk tapping her fingers on her desk with a wicked smile on her face. She had heard enough, she knew it, she had known that the girls had a part in the return of Poppy Moore, she now knew that they were trying to take her for a fool. Well the jokes on them now because she knew it all. \"No one will know I started that fire, if you girls think you'll catch me out your wrong\" \"Uh Harriet, what was that?\" \"God Charlotte can't I think aloud, me thinks so. Now leave\" Charlotte did as she was told and left the room. Harriet looked back at her laptop screen and smiled, she turned off the bug from her end and the shut down the laptop. \"Stupid girls think they can get rid of me, think they are so smart? Well I'm smarter, because it was genius of me to place a little bug speaker in their room and now I know everything. However for now I am going to make sure Poppy and Freddie don't ever have that ghastly moment that they could have had, because Freddie Kingsley is mine, and mine alone Poppy Moore\"[Chapter 15] Chapter XV: Changes Poppy's POV OK, so I've been totally freaking out, and well worrying about this 'where is our relationship thing going' when I should totally be worrying about how I am going to bring that byatch Harriet down. We have so been putting this off for a long time, and now we have to totally get down to business, and get rid of her once and for all. \"Hey Poppy,\" said Drippy who walked into their room. \"Back from detention already?\" \"Yeah, it was a total bore; I had no work to catch up on or anything. Then I totally thought of it, my nails totally needing doing so I did them and time flew right by\" Drippy giggled as I flashed my perfect manicured fingers at her. \"You so have to do mine!\" \"Totally, but you know what I was thinking about? We need to get rid of Harriet, we have totally forgotten about her and what she did and so we need a major plan\" \"Well, you know how smart Kate is-not that your not so shall we wait for her? Oh and Josie, we all know how much she hates Harriet, so she'll totally want to be a part of this\" \"Totally\" I said, but once again my mind was on someone else. No ones POV Harriet walked into her room to see Charlotte sorting out her own clothes on her side of the room. Harriet didn't want to sound to eager and suddenly get rid of her so she knew she had to wait. \"Charlotte, do you think my hair down like this looks good? Me thinks so\" \"Me thinks so too\" mumbled Charlotte who hadn't even looked up at Harriet, whom hadn't even noticed this and continued to look at herself in the mirror. \"What on earth are you doing Charlotte? Don't you have any work to do?\" she suddenly snapped, now getting impatient. \"I was just- The door then opened and Miss Rees-Withers walked in. \"Harriet, I need to go over them lacrosse tournament with you\" \"Right you are Miss Rees-Withers\" she replied with a great smile and left the room behind her. Charlotte put her clothes away and then noticed Harriet's laptop was on, and closed half way, so she went over and opened it and gasped when she realized what she saw. Poppy Moore and Drippy on the screen, in their room. She didn't understand at first and then it hit her. Harriet was spying on them, Harriet was up to something and she no longer wanted to be a part of it, so she knew what she would have to do. Review pls[Chapter 16] Chapter XVI: Trouble No ones POV She stood in the hallway waiting for them to leave, she could hear their voices, and she could hear the laughter and yells. She smiled, they were happy, Poppy Moore was happy because she was innocent, if she wasn't she wouldn't be here, she wouldn't be happy. She was here where she belonged at the school she loved. \"Alright I'm coming! Let's go\" she heard Poppy say to her friends and then the door opened and they all walked out together and headed away from their room. She knew this was her chance and she was going to use this chance, especially considering she had been waiting her in the hallway for almost an hour. But it was the only way she could get away from her, from Harriet. Charlotte Hewer (A.N – Don't know her last name, so I made one up ) was a beautiful girl who only wanted to fit in once she came to Abbey Mount. The only way she thought that would happen if she hung around with Harriet, head girl. She thought being her friend would boost her confidence and help her make friends, what she didn't know was that she would be used as her sidekick, that she would follow Harriet around all day long like a lost puppy. But no more, she knew enough to know that Harriet didn't care about her, nor did she see her as a friend, she saw her nothing more than just her follower, but that would change she wanted to show Harriet that she was no longer in charge of her, and that she was sorry that she ever let her think she was in charge of her. Charlotte looked around the hallway; no one was in site so this was her chance. She walked over to the door and opened it. She smiled as she looked at the room; it was modern, very light and simple unlike the dark browns and dark shades in Harriet's, well her room. She looked all around the room and then smiled when she saw what she needed to. The book that held the bug which was poked into the books spine. The book was on the window shelf and so she walked over to the book and pulled out the bug but then suddenly froze when she heard what she wished she hadn't heard, the door opening. \"Who are you and what are you doing in here?\" She was now caught. ………………………………………………………………….. Freddie's POV \"Hello trouble\" Poppy jumped and spun around on the bench and I laughed and walked around and sat on the bench beside her. \"W-what are you doing here? If someone sees us-\" I put my finger to her lips to keep her from talking anymore. \"I had to see you, it's been a while, and I don't care I'll take the risk, what can I say? Your behavior has rubbed off on me\" \"I've missed you\" she said quietly. \"Me too\" I told her and then kissed her. To kiss her after a while felt great, it made all those unsure feelings I have been having about where this relationship is going and- \"Freddie, I need to talk to you\" \"Schools been so boring this week\" I said ignoring her.. Freddie, are you listening?\" she asked. \"Hows the week been for you?\" OK, so I am kind of avoiding her, or maybe…oh hell, maybe she thinks I'm worried that she might be about to dump me so I'm avoiding this all. \"Freddie, why are you avoiding this?\" \"Avoiding what?\" I asked. \"I said I need to talk to you and- \"I know, and I need to talk to you too, but I guess I'm a bit worried how this will all and you may or may not want to hear what I have to say\" \"Is this about the last time we were together?\" she asked and I nodded. \"I…I talked to Kate about this, and she shared some, she talked to me about her past experiences and it just got me thinking about that moment back in your room and what could have happened and- \"Poppy did you want it to happen?\" I asked looking away. \"I…I thought I was, I mean don't get me wrong I do-if there is anyone I would really want to be with, it's you. I was happy in that moment and I think that I was ready, but when I talked to Kate I didn't know so much anymore. I mean I felt in that moment we were so caught up that I realized that maybe we could be…rushing things?\" I sighed in relief, because she said everything I was feeling. It's exactly how I am feeling and for her to feel the same way is- \"Freddie?\" \"Oh sorry, I…I feel the same way, although I don't think were taking it to fast because we haven't gone to that base yet. So let's just keep at this pace, is that OK with you?\" She smiled which means she understood and felt the same way, which is a relief.[Chapter 17] Chapter XVII: New Piece of the Puzzle No ones POV \"OK, turn around slowly with your hands up\" Drippy said. \"For Christ sake Drippy, you sound like a bloody cop, there's no need for that!\" Josie snapped as Drippy and Kate giggled. \"Alrigh' mate, turn around, now!\" Charlotte slipped the bug into her side pocket hoping that none of the girls would have noticed and then turned around. \"What are you doing here?\" Kate asked. Josie scoffed. \"Looks like Harriet have been sending in her followers to spy on us!\" \"No, it's not like that, I promise you\" she said sincerely. Kate, Drippy and Josie looked at one another, should they trust her word? \"Alright, just say we believe you and want to trust you, how can we when trust works both ways\" Kate said. \"What do you mean?\" she asked. \"I saw you put something away in your pocket, something you must have stolen from our room, show us\" Josie turned to face Kate and then faced off with Charlotte. \"You thief, what did you jack? Turn out your pockets!\" Charlotte hesitated for a moment and then took out the little black bug from her pocket. \"What the fuck is that?\" Josie asked her. \"A bug\" \"A bug? Like a fly, its quite big for a fly, why would you keep a fly in your pocket?\" Drippy asked staring at it. \"Drippy you utter moron, it's not a fly, I mean look you can't even see the things wings!\" Josie said rolling her eyes at her friends. Kate sighed and walked up to Charlotte and held out her hand, Charlotte handed over what she was holding. Kate took a close look at it and then gasped. \"Is this a bug like, hidden camera bug?\" she asked Charlotte who nodded. \"Is it on?\" Kate asked further more in whisper. \"No, because I disconnected it from Harr-from the laptop\" \"Harriet did this? She hid a bug in our room?\" Kate asked shocked, however she released there is nothing to be surprised about considering this what Harriet they were talking about. \"Will you explain Kate?\" Josie asked. \"This\", Kate said holding up the bug, \"is a bug that records peoples voices and well sees people, or our case all our conversations and transfers it to the owners system\" \"Are you tellin me that 'arriet stuck that in our room and- \"I'm afraid so\" Charlotte told her. \"So what were you doing here? Taking it back for her?! You ain't gonna leave this room in one piece!\" Josie snapped. Charlotte looked worried but then decided to tell them why she was here, why she had taken the bug, because really this wasn't any of her fault she in fact had been trying to help them. \"No, I didn't even know about this until I saw her doing something on her laptop and saw this window opened on her laptop and I saw you girls and I realised what she had did and I came here...to take the bug so she couldn't do it anymore\" Charlotte explained quietly. \"Why would you go against Harriet? Don't you love to follow her every command?\" Josie asked. \"Harriet's very keen on getting Poppy kicked out, and I think that Harriet is losing her mind she is so hell bent on getting Poppy out of here that I don't like it, because this\", she said pointing at the bug, \"proves she can go to any extent\" \"Does she know you know?\" Kate asked her. \"No, at least not yet\" \"This could be it, our way to get Harriet out of this place\" Josie said suddenly excited at the thought. \"Harriet could just twist things and get herself out of this, we have to get all proofs for everything she has done, and that includes the fire\" Kate said. \"But- \"I think Kate's right, in fact I think I'll pretend to be keen to the idea of getting Poppy kicked out but tell you girls what she plans on doing every time\" Charlotte told them. Josie smirked. \"Who would have thought you'd be so devious\" \"I just think Harriet should be taught a lesson\" Charlotte shrugged. \"Me thinks so too\" Drippy said and all the girls burst into laughter. ……………………………………………………………… Poppy was sitting at the bench thinking about the few moments she and Freddie had spent there half an hour ago, but what seemed like months ago for her. Freddie left half an hour ago reluctantly, Poppy had to force him to leave and so after her pushing him to go he finally obeyed and left after giving her a kiss that still made her lips tingle at the thought. Poppy finally decided to leave, the more time she spent sat there the more she missed him and she knew she had to get on because they would meet again, and soon she hoped. When she stood she turned and saw Harriet standing a little further behind the bench, her arms folded across her chest and she looked like she meant business. \"What on earth are you doing out here?\" she asked. \"None of your bleeping business\" Poppy told her and walked off past her. \"I shall think it is Mrs. Kingsley's business\" Harriet said and Poppy slowed down but didn't stop nor look over her shoulder. \"I'm sure I'm not breaking any rules by sitting in school grounds on a bench\" Poppy said. \"Of course not, so silly of me. But you did break a rule by seeing Freddie Kingsley right? You know Mrs. Kingsley's son\" Poppy didn't say anything but stopped in her tracks, ok so Harriet had seen them, but so what? By the time Harriet went to Freddie's mum he would be back at his school and Daniel she was sure would cover for him if he were to be questioned about his whereabouts. \"So?\" Poppy opted to annoy Harriet rather than act like she was scared, she wasn't scared. Harriet marched up to Poppy and stood in right in front of her. \"I will make sure that this was the last time you have ever seen Freddie Kingsley\" Poppy laughed in her face. \"Yeah? And how are you going to do that?\" and then walked off. \"I'm not\" she said but Poppy didn't bother responding and continued on her way until \"You are\" \"Excuse me? What makes you think I would make myself stop seeing Freddie?\" \"Oh you will because if you don't it will effect this poor school\" \"Excuse me? What the hell do you mean by that?\" Poppy asked her. \"This place such a pleasant beautiful place, it's Mrs. Kingsley's home, it's her life I would hate it if it had to close down or something\" \"Excuse me? Like you could- \"Of course I couldn't, my family well my father on the other hand could\" \"I don't believe any of your bull shit\" Poppy said and walked away. \"You will eventually\" Ok up to this point it was all the work of miles89-who I thank very much for her amazing imagination and permission to continue this for her- if you anyone has anything they would like to see in here then...YOU'VE GOT TO REVIEW yay.[Chapter 18] All writing prior to this was the work of the awesomely imaginative m-yaz(formerly known as miles89), i take no credit or responsibility. Heh , well this sucks. I take over a story and the next day I get banned from the computer until I get caught up on school. So sorry it took so long everyone and thanks for your patience. Backup and Plans Poppy climbed the stairs to her room as slowly as possible; she needed time to ponder the morning's events before facing the other girls. She didn't know what to think at the minute, of course she wasn't going to be asking them for Freddy advise, she was more than happy to take things as they were for now, it was Harriet that had her worried. And it definitely did not help when she opened the door to her room to see-drum roll please-Charlotte, roommate and hanger-on of yours truly. Oh this was not turning out to be her day; OK maybe just the afternoon, the morning with Freddy was the best she'd had in the last two weeks. \"What…\" Poppy started but was cut off by Josie. \"Poppy it's Ok, she's with us.\" Josie nodded to Kate who proceeded to explain the current situation. \"…And I believe I would not be presuming in thinking that we all want Harriet to have a taste of her own medicine.\" Poppy thoughtfully turned the small bug between her fingers as Kate finished talking. Clearly they had underestimated Harriet's capacity for crossing lines to get her way. \"I agree,\" she said directing her attention to Charlotte who so far had remained silent, \"do you have any suggestions for where to start?\" Charlotte thought for a minute and nodded. \"Yes, her vanity.\" Poppy raised her eyebrows at this suggestion; she was rather surprised that Harriet had any looks to even speak of, much less worry about. The girl's nose and ears were WAAAAAAAAAAAAY disproportional to her face, her eyebrows and hair needed an army of emergency beauticians yesterday, not to mention that really, REALLY bad case of freckles and skin that needed a gazillion cleaning sessions. And the bitch's outfits, OH god ewwwww, even Poppy's fashion challenged cousin would have rather set herself on fire and jump out a window then wear that crap. \"Her vanity?\" Drippy snickered. Even the frizzy haired, slightly plump, klutzishly awkward girl stood more chance of getting a hot date then that… beast-bitch...thingy. Charlotte sighed and rolled her eyes. \"Yes, yes I know what you're thinking, but I'm serious.\" She waited for the amused chuckles to die before pushing on. \"Harriet actually thinks she's, like, god's gift to man, or something. Me and Jane (Harriet's other roommate/sidekick) have been having to come up with crap about Freddy thinking she's pretty because if she thinks he's losing even the slightest bit of interest she goes into these crazy how-could-he do-this-to-me rants that we have to sit and listen to for hours until we can reconvince her that she's the hottest item around and that any guy she comes in contact with would have to be completely mental to not think so.\" \"Thereby explaining her massive beauty egotism.\" Poppy surmised to the agreements of the other girls. \"You have no idea,\" Charlotte grimaced. \"Do you remember who she dressed as at the ball?\" Everyone groan at the memory of Harriet's totally unflattering costume. 'That's because Jane was crazy desperate enough to tell Harriet that Freddy said she looked exactly like Keira Knightly.\" \"Eeeewwwww.\" Poppy grimaced. \"I have met Keira Knightly and Harriet looks NOTHING like her. So your idea is, crash her public image a bit and it might give her cause to back down some?\" Charlotte nodded. \"Sounds like a plan to me,\" Kiki chirped eagerly. \"So operation 'Harriet's Expulsion', phase one, destroy public image. Any idea's on how we do that?\" The ideas were quick to pour in, some were totally outrageous such as Drippy's 'crew cut' idea which was quickly rejected on the grounds that they were ruining Harriet's image- not getting themselves expelled. Other's had more sense to them, such as Kate's 'stick hair dye in her shampoo' and Josie's 'wash her clothes with hot water to shrink 'em'. \"Ok, I think we have enough here to last us awhile,\" Kiki laughed after several minutes. \"It's almost dinner time so how 'bout I write these down and we can meet later to discuss which ones we can actually do.\" \"One more thing,\" Charlotte said, pausing on her way out the door. \"If we're going to get Harriet expelled we'd best have good solid evidence and fast or something unpleasant could happen.\" \"Meaning?\" Josie queried. \"This isn't the first time similar has happened to someone who crossed Harriet the wrong way.\" They girls' interests were instantly peaked. \"What 'are you talking a bout?\" Kate asked. \"I don't know how much of this is true since I came here a year after this happened, but at the time there were…rumors about Harriet.\" Seeing she had a rapt audience Charlotte continued. \"Supposedly the last headgirl was really nice but she was found in possession of drugs and was instantly expelled.\" \"And little miss model student was elected new headgirl.\" Josie nodded with a face suggesting she had tasted something rotten, \"and I used to think she was someone to look up to when I first arrived here.\" Kiki shook her head, \"I remember the girl, Mia, she was this really nice girl, but she was found to have marijuana in her possession and was expelled even though she and all her roommates tested negative for usage or exposure.\" \"Harriet was elected headgirl for being the one to become 'suspicious' of Mia's actions and tipping off Matron on it, she was fourteen at the time.\" Drippy finished in disgust. Charlotte nodded solemnly, \"Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for a way out, but there's not much I can do since I'm pretty much under Harriet's nose 24/7. I can get you information, access to our dorm, and keep tabs on Harriet but my usage to you will be restricted. Though I'm pretty sure Elena (the little girl stuck in their room that Harriet treats like a maid) will be happy to get back a Harriet and Jane sounds like she's just about ready to stick her boot up Harriet's arse and will be happy to help but I'll have to be careful.\" Poppy jumped up from where she was sitting and crossed to stand by Charlotte, \"We're grateful for whatever you can do and thanks, you've helped us get a foot in the door to clearing my name.\" Charlotte smiled shyly at the girl she had originally thought to be a spoiled brat (well to be completely honest she had rather enjoyed those pranks and the way they had pissed Harriet off and given her something else to focus on then Freddy issues) but who had turned out to be quite nice girl, maybe one she could be friends with once this was over. Poppy smiled as Charlotte mumbled and embarrassed 'your welcome' before darting out the door to get ready for dinner. \"Sooo, what now?\" Drippy asked when Poppy closed the door and returned to her bed. \"Now?\" Poppy said. \"We get ready for dinner.\" Poppy waited till the other girls had their backs turned before signaling to Kate who obligingly hung back a bit as the left their room. \"I talked to Freddy this morning.\" Poppy whispered. Kate's eyes went wide but she silently nodded for Poppy to continue. \"We talked about…you know. Anyway we've both agreed to take it slow until we're really sure we're ready.\" This time Kate smiled. \"Good for you Poppy, I wish me and Daniel had done the same thing, not that I regret it, but, you know, things might have been different and we would still be able to see each other everyday instead of having to sneak around all the time.\" \"You're turning eighteen next year right?\" Poppy waited for Kate to nod in reply before continuing. \"So then you guys don't have to listen to your parents, can get married and live happily ever after.\" Poppy said cheerfully trying to lighten the atmosphere that had been dipping since Charlotte's last little revelation. Kate snorted lightly but shook her head sadly. \"It's not that easy Poppy. My parents are rather influential; they and Daniel's mom, hell the rest of my family for that matter, would raise hell doing everything they could to make sure it didn't work out for the two of us.\" \"What?\" Poppy barely caught herself from yelling this. Kate nodded sadly. \"They forbade the two of us seeing each other; they had this huge screaming match after they found out about you know what and my visiting siblings were soooooo 'sympathetic'. I guess it didn't help that the only reason every one stopped screaming bloody murder is because my dad kindly decided a heart attack was in order and everyone so lovingly decided it was my fault.\" Kate's bitter tone caused Poppy to wince. Ok so Kate had told her her family was dysfunctional and reality check challenged in regards to modern day relationships, but seriously… \"Well there's always an open invitation to my place if you two decide to elope. I'm quite sure dad would have no trouble getting you both into good colleges.\" Kate laughed. \"Poppy More, I have yet to meet a more annoyingly brilliant girl that I can call my friend. But really, I think I might still wait a few years to get married. Maybe I'll take you up on that offer after college.\" \"Well,\" Poppy continued, \"Then I shall finish informing you of my completely brilliant scheme. You could talk to your parents about attending college in California while staying with me, I'm sure Daniel could to the same with his mom-just not the staying with me part-and then you both can see each other there where none of your parents can do anything and then you could get married and live in the States till the in-laws get some sense in them. And,\" Poppy held up a hand to forestall the coming argument. \"If your parents do find out prior to that, I'm pretty sure my dad would happily help the girl that 'straightened me out'.\" Kate smiled, \"You'd do that for me?\" \"I'll even put in a good word with your parents about how responsible you are now.\" Poppy chirped as they entered the dining hall. She was glad to see her friend back to her normal cheery self, and even the sight of Harriet glaring bloody murder couldn't dampen it. Now that Harriet knew about their pretensions of hating Poppy there was no reason to keep up appearances. The five girls laughed and chatted easily as they took their seats to the surprise of the other students who had been avoiding Poppy for the most part since her return. A lot of them had liked Poppy but the whole fire incident had kind of put a damper on things. Seeing, however, that Kate and the rest of her roommates had reaccepted her gave them pause to think about maybe things not being as bad as they had thought. Except one. \"Hey heck it out, Harriet's doing her bull impression.\" Josie giggled. Poppy had to restrain herself from having a giggling fit right then and there; Harriet did indeed look like a rabid bull, with her face a shade that would make the most luscious tomato blush and covered in sweat the only thing missing was the stamping hooves and steam blowing out her nose and ears with every breath. \"Ha, even Matron looks scared of her.\" Drippy giggled, blissfully choosing to ignore the daggers Harriet was glaring out of pupils so dilated even Poppy was getting a bit concerned about possible lasting eye damage. \"Well that certainly puts things in perspective.\" Kiki commented wryly as they were handed their plates. \"Yeah it certainly does.\" Drippy smiled, accepting her plate of mush. \"You know,\" Poppy whined looking at the mush that was pilled on in soggy goops. \"I still don't know how they can keep feeding this stuff since it barely constitutes as food.\" Everyone paused before Josie quietly laughed. \"We have a rabid creature to bypass to prove your innocence and all you can think about is how much the food looks like cowpie? Poppy More you are unbelievable.\" The laughter following this statement only died when the bell was rung in call for heads to be bowed in thanks, Poppy obligingly joining in. This time she did have something else other than pulverized beef to be grateful for. A second chance. Yeah yeah, I know it took forever but besides the afore mentioned ban, now I'm on vacation at my grandparents which means camping ten miles from the nearest electrical line and with no signal for a week and tons of other fun time consuming family activities for the next month (not that I'm complaining but, I mean, hey can we have limit here guys, fishing is only fun for so long). So review and let me know how it is, this was a couple months of planned chapter all crammed into several hours of frantic editing to get the story moving as much as possible with my limited time period. Thanks for being so understanding.[Chapter 19] *pokes head cautiously out of bunny-hole to see crowd of bored readers camped out with shotguns* Ah heh, sorry for taking so long, if you would like your chapters sooner you'll have to kidnap my NO.1 hyperactive, knucklehead ninja tag-along if you want me to get off the fantasy wagon long enough to write down this story. Oh and for those who have not noticed, shooting me is very counter-productive to the story line, not to mention I still have that grenade launcher in my basement so your guns are totally pointless mwahahahahahahahahahaha! CHAPTER XIX: Choices Choices. \"Blue.\" \"No.\" \"Errrrrrrrrrrr, green?\" Poppy barely restrained the urge to face palm. \"Drippy we are trying to ruin herself image not turn her into Godzilla!\" This idea was turning out to be more trouble than she had anticipated and it was quickly becoming quite the headache between them. \"So what are we going to do?\" Kiki said as she started swinging her legs, a bad habit she had when she was nervous. \"Yes, come on Poppy.\" Even Kate was starting to get exasperated. They had spent all their free time the night before and today being Saturday, with Poppy grounded and all, they decided on dedicating the time to conniving how to bring about Harriet's demise. \"You were wonderful last time, what happened to your imagination.\" \"Last time anything went cuz we were trying to get me expelled and they were trying to keep me. This time we can't afford to get caught.\" Poppy sighed and leaned back against the wall. Truth is last time it was the other girls who did most of the pranks which had largely stemmed from the innate desire of all children to annoy the daylights out of those in power. She had merely been along for the ride in case they got caught which would have been awesome for her cause for freedom from what she had previously perceived as a prison. \"We need finesse, delicacy,\" Drippy droned. \"We need to be subtle yet shocking enough to be convincing. We need…\" \"We need help!\" Poppy declared springing off her bed. \"Drippy you're brilliant.\" \"Well thank you,\" the confused girl smiled. \"But all I said was…\" \"What you said has made me realize how unprepared we are to deal with this girl.\" Poppy dug under the second layer of clothes in her draw for the hidden phone she stashed there. \"We are dealing with a master of the game and are woefully incapable of handling it alone.\" \"Sooo…?\" Kate was the one who had to Ok the pranks to make sure she could offer decent arguments in Poppy's defense in the event the Board swallowed Harriet's tacking it on her nemeses. Poppy grinned and scrolled through her contacts. \"When you want to blow up a building you call in a bomb tech. When you want to blow someone's reputation….\" She punched the 'call' button and waited. \"You know an image ruining specialist?\" Drippy asked in shock. \"Something like that,\" Poppy waved a hand for silence as she listened to the familiar tune of Intuition by 'Jewel' bounce out the speaker. \"Something like that?\" Kiki gave her strange look. \"You'll see,\" Poppy smiled reassuringly, \"I hope.\" \"You're sure this person can help us?\" Kate was not sure she liked the idea of some outsider coming in but if that's the best they had… Poppy's expression drooped a peg, 'I'm not sure. We haven't spoken in a while which is why I'm calling my sister first to check if she even remembers I exist.\" \"Elloooo Pops! Whazz-ap!\" Poppy almost cracked her skull on the roof-beam as the overly exaggerated tones assaulted her hearing took her stomach for a fieldtrip to the school dungeons. Only one person had ever dared call her 'Pops' and that was the one person she was now dreading to face. \"Er, hi Astrid,\" Poppy grimaced. \"It's been awhile, how are you?\" \"Oh peachy as hell, you now me girl.\" Astrid laughed. \"You wanted to talk to Molly right? Give me sec, she's in the shower.\" \"Uuuuuh, um, no actually, uuuuuh.\" Poppy tripped over her words as her tongue and brain tried to sort out their complicated tango on the way to her vocals. \"Oh wrong number?\" Poppy tried not to clench her teeth at the too cheerful tones filtering back over the speaker. \"N...no. I was calling her, erm. Why are you answering Molly's phone? \"Cuz she left it down here while she was helping me make popcorn.\" \"Popcorn? At this time of day!\" \"Uhhhhh Pop's, time lines. You're kind of on the other side of this ball of dirt.\" Oh, shit, Poppy had forgotten in her urgency to find resolution. \"Oops.\" \"Want me to have her call you back?\" \"No!\" Poppy panicked, she decided it better to just ask so she didn't have to disturb her sister for help. \"That is, I was calling her to find out how to get in touch with you.\" \"Why Poppy, I am flattered. You called to see how little ol' me was doing.\" This time Poppy had to rub her head, she had almost forgotten her overly keyed up cousin's unnatural bend for dramatizing most of her conversations when in a good mood. Someone upstairs must have a grudge against her. Might as well get this over with, she decided. \"Ah, Astrid, um, the-truth-is-I-need-your-help-with-something.\" \"Huh?\" Poppy could just visualize the other girl's patented 'whaaaa/huh?' look. \"Could you repeat that, you were kinda mumbling.\" \"I need your help with something,\" Poppy grit out between her teeth. A pause at the other end, then… \"Ladies and gentlemen the sky is falling with Klingon chasers, Jadis has replaced Satan and the ice age of Hades has commenced.\" Peals of silvery laughter drifted in the declaration's wake. \"If this has nothing to do with Molly then do you mind if I switch over to my phone?\" Poppy agreed and hung up to face a storm of questions. \"Who is…?\" \"What…\" \"Are you seriously…\" \"Stop!\" Poppy held up a hand and immediate silence fell. \"Astrid is the daughter of my dad's younger sister, if you really must know the French lesson tape swap was her's originally.\" She sighed and sat at the foot of the bed while the others crowded around eagerly for details. Poppy decided on explaining it in detail as it would cut down having to bounce between the multiple questions. \"They used to live in Malibu and Astrid was like an older sister that took care of me and Molly when our mom died. \"She had this huge prankster complex and that French thing was her's only it was our Spanish classes and she was not nearly as polite to the point they had to lock up the tapes to keep her out. Didn't work though.\" Poppy added to the girls responding giggles. \"Sadly in junior high we started drifting apart. The final split came when her family moved to Maryland because her dad's in the CIA and got a promotion and we haven't seen or spoken to each other since.\" \"So what is she doing at your place?\" Kiki frowned. \"That,\" Poppy stated, \"is precisely what I intend to ask her first when she calls back. And there she is.\" \"I'm here with my mom to help with the preparations for your dad's wedding.\" Was the bored response to Poppy's inquiries. \"Wedding!\" Poppy screeched so loud Drippy, who was nearest, was forced to slap her hand over the stunned girl's mouth lest Matron or one of the other students hear and decide to investigate. \"But…but he already married her!\" Poppy gulped as visions of being stuffed into a frilly gown of her step-mother's choosing and a solemn-faced priest rose before her eyes. Barely restrained coughs of laughter echoed back along the connection. \"They signed the papers Pops, but in case you forgot the whole shebang was set for the summer when you get back from school.\" Poppy groaned, it stood to wonder that she ever hoped her father's new wife would be happy to settle for a simple ceremony. And no public event involving her aunt was ever small. \"Don't worry, I'll email you mom's dress designs so you can cut and mix if you want and I am not, under any circumstances, letting Tara pick the music.\" Poppy's sigh of relief was palatable, her dad's new wife had terrible taste in music that almost no sensible person had heard of much less could tolerate. \"Now then,\" Astrid switched to formal, \"in what way may I be of service dear long estranged cousin.\" Yet another annoying aspect of Astrid, she habitually plowed through subjects no matter how uncomfortable like a duck through water even if the opposing party had the tolerance of a cat dropped in the Pacific. \"No, let me guess. Starting to find ourselves in over our head now that we're no longer playing the bitch game?\" Poppy was shocked, \"how did you…\" \"Be glad your sister has better sense than you when it comes to family ties honey.\" The statement fiercely annoyed Poppy until Astrid went on. \"Fortunately for you I have already taken the liberty of doing a little poking but it'll be a week before I can get over there.\" Poppy did not try to hide the thrill of elation and relief at the sound of those words. \"Really? That's great. Wait, what kind of poking?\" \"Oh, little of this bit of that. It's a kind of a mess, this Punta (1) is seriously wacko, but I think you will be happy with what I have for you. Now is there anything else you need before I go?\" \"Ruin her self-image eh?\" Astrid rubbed her hands in glee. \"Well that's been rather uncalled for since I escaped high school but I suppose I had better stay in shape for when the higher education officer comes a' knocking.\" Poppy could have jumped over the moon at this point but settled for pumping her fist in the air in victory, finally after a month of subterfuge and generally just trying to stay on top of the Harriet case victory actually seemed in reach. \"Now you wouldn't happen to have some more 'personal' details on Hairy- It would ya?\" Kiki was immediately dispatched to find Charlotte when Poppy heard Astrid speaking. \"Soooooo…\" Poppy winced at the tone of impish glee, \"headmistress's boy eh? That's not like you Pops. But judging by his picture I think I can see the attraction.\" Poppy almost went through the roof. \"How in the hell did you get a picture of Freddy?\" \"Ow,\" Astrid snarked, \"that was my ear you just tried to bust and if my Bluetooth decides it doesn't like you I'm adding it to your IOUs. As for how I know what he looks like it's called Facebook girl, welcome do Twenty-Faust Cen-ta-wee. Hey did you know he went to France last summer and met one very lovely Mademoiselle whom he is still in contact with.\" Thankfully Kiki returned at this point and Poppy was all too glad to fork over the piece of technology before her cousin could get into full ribbing mood. Poppy sat on the foot of her bed and tried not to show her anxiety as Charlotte answered questions about Harriet's daily routines, quirks, and personal items before returning the phone. \"So what can you do with this?\" she tried not to sound desperate but Astrid's mentioning of Freddy had reminded her of what was at stake if Harriet won out. \"Plenty.\" From the glee in her voice Poppy knew something was coming but she wasn't sure she wanted to know. She could almost imagine the wheels spinning in her cousin's slightly demented brain. \"By the way do you want her bulimic or fat?\" \"Wh…what?\" Astrid sighed, \"you know my job would be much easier if you could stop acting so goddamn surprised every time I say something.\" \"You know what Ash, I give up. Do whatever you damn well please just get me out of this before something really bad happens.\" Poppy didn't like to think she was begging but all the tension was finally getting to her. 'If you say so.\" Astrid frowned. \"You gonna be Ok till I get there? I could tell mom to stick it if you really…\" Poppy shook her head, the other girls were risking their own school careers to help her, she didn't want them to think she wasn't capable of handling this by asking Astrid to hurry. \"Arighty then, I will dust off my Master Book of Nasty and get to work.\" \"So I guess I'll see you soon?\" \"Next Friday latest, and Poppy,\" Astrid paused, her tone going serious, \"don't wait to call me this time if things get bad.\" Poppy tried to sound confident as she replied, \"Ash I can take care of myself already. This is just a speed bump.\" \"More like Amazonian termite hill.\" Astrid muttered. \"See ya.\" XXXXXXXXXXX Poppy hummed under her breath happily as she skipped up the front steps. She managed to convince the other girls to take Sunday and go to town without her, Astrid it seemed had not given up on her after all, and in a week Harriet was headed for an emotional meltdown. Right now the only thing that could make the day more perfect was another surprise visit from the love of her life, but she knew that wasn't about to happen so was content to count her blessings. She was so busy imagining a school without Harriet and where she and Freddy could be without constraints she failed to notice the person until she bumped into them. \"Oh, I'm so sorry sir,\" she tried to apologize. \"My mind must have been somewhere else and I didn't see you.\" \"Quite alright young lady, no harm no foul.\" He smiled genially. \"Yes,\" a familiar oily tone simpered from behind the man. \"Just a silly mistake really. Miss Moore.\" \"Harriet.\" Poppy stated stiffly. The Head Girl slid around the man's side to take his hand. \"Father,\" she smiled sweetly, \"this is Poppy Moore. Our American exchange student.\" Poppy managed to resist the urge not to throttle Harriet as the other girl looked down her nose as if being in the same vicinity as herself were some royal favor she was bestowing on some lowly peasant. \"A Pleasure Miss Moore.\" Harriet's father held out his hand. It's not every day we have company form our western neighbors. I trust you and my Allota are getting along well?\" \"Well this has been fun,\" Harriet's smile barely managed to keep a fingertip hold above a grimace, \"but we really must be getting along. Daddy!\" She started firmly tugging him away, \"Mother is waiting.\" \"See ya.\" Poppy smiled innocently after them. \"Lovely meeting you Miss Moore,\" Harriet's father called back as he followed his daughter up the stairs. Once they were out of earshot Poppy pulled out her phone and speed dialed Kate. \"This can't be good,\" Kate grimaced. \"Lord and Lady Harriet normally visit the school annually to see how things are running and how their daughter is but that's not supposed to be for another six weeks.\" \"Think maybe she's playing them up to charge me for the fire repairs?\" Poppy peeked through the trees as Mrs. Kinsley walked the family back from inspecting the lacrosse field. Harriet, the image of graces, walking arm-in-arm between her parents. Kate quirked a smile, \"I don't know. Can they?\" Poppy pulled back and sat on the ground as the tour group disappeared through a side door. \"Well I guess we'll have to wait and see.\" \"Do you want us to come back?\" \"No,\" Poppy shook her head. \"They can't do anything and they deserve the time for themselves. I'm sure it's nothing. Maybe I'm just being paranoid.\" Kate shrugged. \"Alright, but please Poppy, don't try anything while I'm gone.\" \"Wouldn't dream of it,\" Poppy grinned. 'Now go have fun. Make Daniel see what he's been missing all these months.\" \"Ok, I'd better make sure Matt doesn't strangle Freddy to stop him moaning about how he wishes you were here.\" Giggling, Kate hung up and returned to the café where the boys had joined the girls for the afternoon. Slipping into the seat next to Daniel, she sighed and happily leaned into the arm he wrapped around her shoulders while trying not to laugh at Freddy and Matt's heated argument over possible ways of sneaking Lover Boy into Abbey Mount undetected. This was the calm before the storm and Poppy was right. The other girls needed this time away from the school because once things were set in motion there was no telling where they would go. For now at least, she was happy to let someone else do the crazy plotting while her own boyfriend fed her bits of cookies. This is why it's worth the risk. She thought blissfully as Kiki joined in to yell about why scaling school walls in the middle of the night was a bad, bad idea. \"No running in the hall Miss Moore.\" Matron scolded the hurrying Poppy. \"Yes Matron.\" Poppy sweetly replied. One more flight of stairs and she could lock herself away in her room until the girls got back. Or until the Harriets left before their daughter could try something to foul their view of Poppy, not that it should take much given current events. Twenty more feet…. \"Oh Miss Moore, I was just looking for you to have a word.\" Poppy froze. Oh crap, not good . Slowly she turned to face the girl whose smile was like a frosted cobra. \"What do you want Harriet.\" Poppy managed not to spit like afore thought reptile. Harriet continued her cheerful façade. \"Nothing much. Just showing my parents the school, which, I'm sure you must know, is maintained quite largely by their annual donations.\" Poppy was to tired and frazzled to play loop-de-loop with the other. \"What are you trying to tell me Harriet?\" she grumble/sighed. Harriet slithered forward. \"You do not belong here. You have no business being here.\" The last sentence taking on a harder edge. \"Infact, your presence is ruining this school.\" \"And, how is it you figure that Harriet?\" Poppy sassed back. Now the smile was losing it's sugary coating. \"Let me put it this way Moore. My parents are the main reason this crumbling facade of the last century has not been turned into some museum like it should have years ago.\" \"Are you threatening me Harriet?\" Poppy hissed, now the girl was making her mad. \"Not at all my dear Poppy.\" The words oozed like putrid mud. \"What I am saying is, if my parents for any reason should decide I am not benefiting from Abbey Mount as much as my potential allows, they will see to it that I am moved to a school that does encourage my talents to their full capacity.\" \"You're threatening to stop the schools funding!\" The realization hit Poppy like the hoses on the night of the fire. Without the funding Mrs. Kingsley would be forced to cut back on some of the schools facilities or lower the standard of the school which would lead other parents to reconsider their own daughter's education as well. It was a domino effect that would destroy everything Freddy's mom had dedicated years of her life to building. Suddenly Poppy hated Harriet. The fire she could accept as mean pettiness to remove her nemesis for power. But to destroy someone's life work for your own whims was beyond bitchy. It was downright evil and cruel. \"You are one evil bitch.\" Poppy spat. \"There's no way they'll fall for it Harriet had the audacity to simply look amused at this display of temper. \"Is that so Miss Moore. And who will be presenting this argument?\" Harriet scoffed. \"You? The girl who almost burned down the school now defending it?\" Poppy felt the air being sucked away with that last statement. Harriet was right, they still hadn't figured out how to clear her name and until then she was at the bottom of the list for the other parents to listen to. Harriet leaned back to savor the sight of the fight deflating out of her nemesis. She allowed the reality of the situation sink in for a few more moments before putting the last touches to her plan. \"However,\" she decided to dispense with the 'nice' layering as she leaned in for the kill, \"there is something you can do to ensure our beloved Headmistress many more wonderful years in service to this pathetic institution she stubbornly clings to.\" Poppy gulped against the sickly threads of dread flowing over her. Harriet wanted to bargain, which meant she knew she held all the chips in this game. Even God would be hard pressed to find her an escape now. \"What?\" she finally managed to sulk. Harriet's smile of victory went into full anaconda mode. \"It's very simple deary,\" She crooned, her voice like slugs fresh out of the bog on Poppy's senses. \"You have something that belongs to me and I want it back, that's all.\" \"Freddy!\" Poppy hissed, the mental image of this harpy getting her malformed claws into the love of her life resparking defiance in her chest. Harriet smiled oily. \"Get him to break up with you and I will not tell my parents Abbey Mount is a pathetic sham-up that harbors delinquents which I will not tolerate being forced to coexist with.\" This time Poppy couldn't help the sharp intake of breathe that was all too audible to the other girl. Staying out of the way and letting Harriet ply her \"charms' on Freddy she could handle, hell she would agree just for the fun of watching. Leaving she would do in a heartbeat to protect the people she loved. But breaking up with him ? That was humanly impossible. \"Oh and I think we really can't afford to have your friends trying anything stupid, like oh say, reuniting you by some other whorish means the way they did the last time so they will have to go to.\" \"What!\" The last statement was like a physical blow to the gut. Get the girls expelled? Merciful gods, was there no end to this madness? \"No!\" Harriet raised an eyebrow. \"No?\" \"No I will not do your dirty work!\" Poppy shoved up in the girl's face. \"If you want to get the other girls thrown out I'll leave before that happens!\" Harriet's response was to cover her mouth in a fit of creepy giggles. \"Have them expelled?\" she shook her head like she was talking to a misguided child. \"Hardly Miss Moore. No, no. I have no desire to see them removed. After all, it is no fault of their own that they have been led astray by the malfeasances of unschooled young interloper.\" Placing an arm around the stunned girl, Harriet steered Poppy toward her room while chattering on. \"But not to worry, I'm sure you will all make up and get on quite lovely once you have been shown the error of your ways and this sordid affair will soon be naught but a… wonderful memory of a time when you simply were in need of a little guidance in these… troubling years of the transition to womanhood. \"Do think on what I have said today, will you.\" Harriet crooned softly as she brought them to a stop outside the room. \"I'm sure you will see that what I'm asking is really not such a terrible thing.\" Pulling herself up as if fully satisfied with herself, Harriet smiled at the slumping girl before her. \"I shall be expecting your answer by tomorrow latest.\" With that, she turned and disappeared down the hall, all grace and poise as she went. (1)-whore Ok very sorry for the wait (Miley89; 2 whole bloody years) *ducks thrown laptop* yes well the excuses would take a whole page so I will leave you all will a thanks for those who stuck around and very big apology for the wait so take these with my regards*holds up extra large plate of cookies and keg of beer* XD. If you keep your fingers crossed I might find time between my horse competitions and other writing stuff to do the next chapter before the month is out. But there's a catch. There is a nice button down there labeled 'comment' and you have to use it or my incentive has a tendency to dry up when no one lets me know what they think of it.[Chapter 20] No PrettyReckless09 I could never leave a story unfinished, god forbid the thought! Though I think at this point apologizing is useless since I'm always taking forever to sneak away from my lovely book mountain so I can write without them protesting my changed attentions. Besides which it would take forever since I inherently suck at apologies. *grins to self while watching Loki sneaking off with her latest story idea* hmmm does he know he's actually doing us all a favor or perfectly aware of the fact because he wants to see what happens next as well? Enjoy. Chapter XX:I Will Always Love You. If I should stay, I'd only be in your way. Ragged breaths trilled in sadistic tango with the moaning of the wind. Poppy gulped against the lump rising to her throat, constricting her airway as it slowly choked off her breath. Somehow the idea of dying here was almost appealing. She had always wondered how a person could reach such depths that they would voluntarily choose to end their life. Now she knew. Standing here on the edge of the dorm roof watching the clouds boil like a miasma of forms mocking her grief, the thought of entering an eternal darkness void of pain or regret was almost like a gentle balm over the raw wounds burning in her chest. It shouldn't hurt this much. Last time seemed a mild sting in comparison with the ugly claws tearing their uncompassionate way through her heart. Last time it wasn't your doing. The scornful tone giggled in her head. This time you really done it and it's all your fault. The first sob finally was allowed to break through the thickness in her throat. A small, pitiful sound immediately lost to the cacophony of mocking howls that billowed around her. It wasn't supposed to be this way. Why? It was so unfair. She had done nothing wrong. Except fall in love. Bittersweet memories, that is all I'm taking with me. \"So nothing happened?\" Poppy sighed and rubbed the heel of her hand above one eye. Kate had lost no time inquiring if anything else had happened while the were gone which led to a demanded full explanation by the other girls. She recounted meeting the Harriets but was careful not to mention the confrontation with the other girl. That was something she wasn't sure she should share. Luckily the others were to busy analyzing the minute details of what the unexpected visit could hail to notice her inattentiveness. Much as she hated to admit it the threat of the pulled funding by the Harriets was weighing on her mind. She had put on a brave front but now her insides were churning all over the stomach. Harriet would do as she said, of that Poppy had no doubt. There is a way to save them… No! She couldn't even bear to contemplate the idea. It was maddens. But still, if you don't do it… \"When's Kate going to be back?\" If there was one person she could talk to it was Kate. But right after dinner the prefect had been called to the main office for a faculty meeting and had yet to return. \"It's almost bed time so she should be back. Though if it's really important, like maybe something to do with this afternoon's visit, it might go on longer.\" Josie shrugged and thumped up her pillow. \"Really weird if you ask me. Think Harriet's on to us?\" \"Nah,\" Kiki said optimistically. \"Charlotte would have noticed and told us. \"Poppy? You alright?\" The question took several seconds to filter through her rampant thoughts, long enough for the other girl to start looking at her odd. \"Huh?\" \"Seriously!\" Drippy huffed. \"You've been out of it all evening. Are you sure there isn't something else on your mind?\" \"Nope,\" Poppy quickly covered, 'nothing. Just a bit impatient to get this whole damn thing over with.\" The other girls 'aaaaahed' and exchanged knowing glances. \"Love sickness is a terrible thing, neh?\" Josie giggled. \"Freddy! Wherefore art thou Freddy?\" Drippy stood on her bed in an exaggerated poise with her arm reaching out dramatically. \"I doth beseech you most desperately, take me away from my dismal tower.\" \"Alas!\" Kiki jumped in and kneeled equally dramatically on the floor. \"This vile, villainous hog hide of a beast seeks to enamor herself unto me. Endure yet awhile, I beg you, for then I shall hold you in mine arms until the flames of Hell consume my flesh and bone and the earth rise to bury me in its depths!\" \"From whence cometh the royally screwed Shakespeare?\" Poppy couldn't help laughing at the overly comical actions of the two hyped up girls. Kiki ignored the jib. \"Wait! I hear footsteps! Farewell my sweet, till we meet again in paradise.\" The footsteps, it turned out, were matron doing pre-bed rounds to straighten out any late weekend revelers. Once they stopped laughing the accumulated excitement of the day settled in and one after the other had little trouble dropping of to sleep, leaving only Poppy to turn in her thoughts. The last lines may have been meant as a joke but Poppy knew the hidden truth behind them. Because she would walk through Hell and definitely take getting buried alive over what had been asked of her any day. No! She shook her head, I can't think like that. I have to fight this. There has to be another way . But… Kate didn't return for another half-hour and was too tired to talk till the next morning. \"The Harriets are apparently concerned that the school maybe be getting a bit lax in its standards after the fire and came to ensure everything was still in top form. The meeting was simply to stress this point is all. \"Nothing to worry your head about. After all,\" she smiled knowingly at Poppy, \"don't you have bigger concerns?\" Poppy gulped and managed a grin that did not look strained. \"But if they think that the standards are dropping couldn't they just pull Harriet and send her to another school?\" She had to know if it was a possibility. Kate shrugged. \"They could but I doubt they would this late in the semester. And Abbey Mount is on of the highest ranking in the country. It would only happen if something major were to occur. \"And by major I mean far more serious than just some butterfingered student with a lighter.\" Kate rolled her eyes when a look flashed across Poppy's face. \"Your accident is hardly the worst to befall this school. Though I'm sure it must rank somewhere in the top ten most annoying students on record.\" Poppy laughed and turned away. The look Kate had mistaken for panic was in fact fear of what worse acts would have to be pulled for Harriet to accomplish her goal. The rest of the day showed just how much sway the bitch held over the place. Teachers were strictly careful to keep all students from putting a toe out of line while remaining subserviently cordial to the one responsible for this tension. The girl herself relished in the atmosphere and decided to celebrate by churning out several detentions and remonstrations she artfully set up other students to take the fall for even if it should have been blatantly obvious to the teachers who was to blame. \"They don't dare,\" Harriet crooned sickeningly as she joined Poppy on the edge of the field where the rest of team was warming up. \"They, unlike some, know their place in society and wisely choose to act accordingly.\" Poppy seethed silently. Just earlier, on her way to the library before lunch, she happened to glance through the partially open door of the headmistress's office to see her talking on the phone with a rather haggard look on her face. \"Absolutely lovely my dear,\" she had smiled at Poppy's quires if everything was alright. \"Just trying to organize a bit of sponsoring for some upcoming events is all.\" Events where the Harriet's funding was no longer available to help maintain upkeep of school standards, Poppy thought bitterly. She's done this long enough to see a veiled threat even when it might not have been originally intended. But she doesn't want me to know it's because of me. There is a way to ensure she had many more years to enjoy her work… Poppy didn't trust Harriet any more than she would a Great White with strap-on dolphin snout and flippers. But if her actions could placate the witch… \"You promise…\" she had to pause to work out the catch in her voice, \"you promise to leave the school alone. That your parents won't pull funding if I do what you ask?\" The words were like swallowing while hot nails sharpened to scalpel points. Anyone less intent than Poppy would have missed the flicker of surprise zipping over Harriet's face. For a moment a swell of hope surged through Poppy's chest that it had all been a really bad, stress induced dream. Until Harriet spoke. \"I do believe I already told you. And a lady always keeps her word.\" Poppy wanted to be physically sick just from hearing those lines in that voice but managed to maintain her self control. \"Then I'll do it.\" Harriet's eyes gleam maliciously over the sigh of defeat Poppy didn't bother to hide. \"You are making the right choice for all of your futures.\" Jafar himself would have spooked at that tone. So I'll go, but I know I'll think of you every step of the way. The phone felt like a thousand pounds in her hand. \"Yeah I know, it's really pathetic.\" Below her, in the room, all movement stopped. \"It was kind of fun at the start but now it's almost sad how easily they bought it. I mean, you'd think they would have been more suspicious right?\" They should have stayed suspicious. They d never have brought her back here. She had wanted this second chance so badly she hadn't thought of the consequences it might cause. \"I wonder if I should thank Harriet for doing such a cheap stunt. Sticking notes underneath the door? So last decade.\" Why couldn't they have left well enough alone? They had no obligations to her, she had been using them from the start originally, they knew that. Why did they have to go playing the hero and digging up some loophole to get her back just so she would have the opportunity to do it all over again? Only this time for real. \"Nah, it's no biggy.\" The words once second nature were now like adder poison on her tongue. \"They were so easy to manipulate you almost have to feel sorry for them. That call to my cousin totally sold it. \"Yeah, dad said I needed to make up with her before the wedding. So basically this has been like knocking out three birds with one stone. I'll just call her in a day or two and tell her I don't need her anymore.\" Cover all the bases; leave no opportunity for them to question her motives. \"And once he sees how much I've ' changed' it's home sweet sunny Malibu. How is Roberto?\" Finally this part. The one that would drive the nail in her coffin. More accurately the stake through her heart. \"Tell him I'd call but I can't risk the other girls hearing. \"Yeah I know. Freddy is gorgeous but he's still such a kid. So annoying. Yeah he's cute, kind of like a puppy dog that can't get enough of licking your hand, but that's about it. Great for the 'perfect girl' image but terrible in the romance department. \"You know, he actually snuck into the school the other day and all he did was kiss me! How nerdy is that? Someone get that boy a dating adviser and don't let it be Romeo.\" The words were like frozen tendrils twisting their way through her gut. But the final blow was yet to come. \"Ok Ruby, see you in the summer. We'll get drunk at my dad's wedding, ditch the bitch over the cliff and talk the boys into driving us down the beach in their cars. I hate this place. Almost no sun, terrible for the skin. \"Tell Roberto I love him. Yep, love you more. Bye.\" The dead phone snapped shut. The sound louder than an executioner's bullet rebounding in an empty room. One last action. One last twist and it would all be over. Four stunned looks met her as she climbed back through the window. Four pairs of eyes begged her to say it wasn't so. That they had not once again been made to look like complete fools for their kindness and understanding. They were wasting their time. Love and friendship can't save us now, Poppy thought bitterly. \"Hey guys, what's with the faces? You'd think someone just died here.\" That's it keep it short and cheery, like you think they still haven't caught on to what you're doing. Drippy let out a wretched sob and dashed out the door, flinging it open so hard it crashed loudly against the wall behind. \"Is it true?\" Poppy tried looking puzzled at the question from Josie who looked ready to follow in Drippy's footsteps. \"What is?\" \"That you're just using us. That it's all another part of your big plan to get back in your father's good books so he'll let you go back home to sweet sunny Malibu !\" The sensation of blood draining from Poppy' face was for an entirely different reason but no less terrible. \"You eavesdropped on my phone conversations!\" That's it. Rub it in a little more and it would all be over. \"We trusted you!\" Kiki shrieked. \"Say it isn't true. Now you've got some crazy plan and this is all part of a test. To see how far we're really able to go!\" The rest of what happened was all a blur Poppy couldn't remember. It was like being on autopilot. She said what she had to, they sounded weak even to her. Rehearsed words to put doubt and anger in minds where there had once been acceptance and trust. Hopefully the pain they brought would be enough to blind their targets to the hollowness beneath. Finally the only one left was Kate. The prefect, the first truly best friend Poppy had been able to call hers in so long. She shook her head sadly and turned to go after the others. \"That cal was a lie. I refuse to believe it. I know you Poppy Moore. Probably better than you do yourself.\" With those words she turned and went to find and comfort her missing roommates, leaving Poppy to sink to her knees as the agony of those final words were at last permitted to tear through her being. So, goodbye. Please, don't cry. We both know I'm not what you, you need. It had been three days. Not one of the girls saw fit to speak to her. Poppy did not blame them. Their friendship from before was pond deep compared to the bonds they had woven in the last short month since she had returned. Now they lay in scattered shreds about the school that had once seemed a refuge for her but was slowly turning back into her prison cell. No, torture chamber was more like. With her friends once again avoiding all contact the other students had opted to maintain a safe distance. Harriet was still on a high and all were scared at the idea of attracting her attention for next target. And if the previously tight knit group was now split in solitary silence they had no intension of being mixed in with another's problems. The cloying atmosphere was broken by the sound of an engine roaring its way up the gravel drive. The one behind the wheel obviously not caring about ceremony or dignity. \"Where is Poppy Moore?\" he demanded of the first student to cross his path in the entrance hall. The frightened second year squeaked and stood like a deer in his spotlights. \"Oh Freddy, Mr. Kinsley, what are you doing here? I believe your ban on entering these grounds is does not expire for another two months at least.\" Freddy ground his teeth and turned to face the speaker. \"Hello Miss Harriet I was wondering if anyone would be so kind as to point me in the direction of Poppy Moore.\" Harriet remained unperturbed as she stood looking down on the frazzled young man from her position on the stairs. \"Miss Llywen, please could you be so obliged as to summon Mrs. Moore. I do believe you will find her in the middle of Physics at the moment. Tell the teacher it is a school matter and she is excused for the day. It would appear Mr. Kingsley's problem cannot be put off.\" The terrified student ran off as fast as her chubby legs could carry her. Her roommate had spent four hours cleaning the lacrosse team's locker room two days before when Harriet took it in her head to accuse the girl off creating puddles in the bathroom that she almost slipped on. \"What was so urgent you had to break the rules to come Freddy?\" Harriet's heart was dancing at the reason she already knew but could not help wishing to hear from the love of her life's mouth himself. The little brat had done as she was instructed. Finally, after months of agony and heartbreak, Freddy would be all hers again. To love and woo with no fluctuating fancies of some interloper to distract him from her. Now all that was left was to watch the final break and her triumph would be complete. She had not long to wait. Poppy Moore slowly dragged this herself down the corridors, obviously well below her normal standards of appearance. This dismal picture of human suffering sent a rush through her like nothing but sweet, sweet victory could bring. \"You have a visitor it would seem.\" Poppy glared hellfire at her rival but when she saw who it was to see her all the fight collapsed. No! She begged. Not him too. Not Freddy! Please gods no! \"Remember our deal,\" Harriet whispered as Poppy drifted dumb-shocked past her down the stairs. \"Him or the school.\" Him or the school? Freddy or the school? Your friends or the school? Love or the school! The school would still be here. They would still all be friends and have happy lives. Just without her. They would all get over her eventually. A few months, maybe a year. They would hurt, wonder how they could have been so blind to her wiles, but they would get over it. They would move on and take this as another life lesson to be learned. In a few years it would be just a bad memory in an otherwise regular, boring, and normal high school life. He would find someone better, more suited to his kind, gentle nature than this brash unfeeling, unthinking brat. She doubted anyone could be capable of loving him as much as she did, no way. But love him she would and he her. With no thought of whether or not she was for real or just using him as a pawn in her game, ready to sacrifice him at any moment to gain her achievements. You deserve better than me. The thought was worse than running through all that smoke and the fire to show the emergency crew where Drippy was trapped in the freezer. But it was the only way she could keep going. I'm not what you need. You don't want this spoiled prima Donna whose attraction to you was originally just as a means to get out of here. You deserve someone who cares for you as only you, not as a tool to get what she wants. It was like the day her mother died all over again. Except this time it was her fault. But this time she could make sure only she suffered. The countdown had already been set in motion and this was the only way to diffuse it. \"Oh, hi Freddy.\" Anything more would be foolish. She had dumped a dozen boys before him. It was part of being one of the socially elite back home; you changed the guy depending on the time and styles. The trick was doing it so as to eliminate as much of the drama as possible. Ruby had been one of those kinds who just adored being moped over and laughing it up later. Poppy slipped into the role but had never found it possible to bring herself to be that heartless. Instead she found ways to let him know she wasn't doing it because of something he did, just that she was no longer uninterested in what he had to offer. No doubt the girls had seen him as the last option of talking some sense into her and wasted no time calling him in a flurry. This meant he most likely already knew the basic content of her fake conversation with Ruby. \"What are you doing here?\" Like you don' know. \"Is it true?\" Poppy had grit her teeth in preparation for an onslaught of anger and hurt accusations, maybe some yelling. But this… Standing there looking at her with quite eyes full of pain, it drive a knife through every wall and barrier she had ever learned. Only the continued presence of Harriet managed to keep her upright and the tears well choked behind a tin film of sacrificial loyalty. \"What is?' Think about the school. Think about the school. Think about what he would say if his mom lost everything because of you. You can do this… \"That you love someone else? A Roberto was it?\" The pain was too much. The hall swam before her eyes as all fight and ration leaked out of her chest. I can' do this… \"I'll leave you two to it then.\" The sickly cloying tones were like a slap of frozen sludge on her senses that brought her out of it. I have to do this. She ground down on her tongue until Harriet disappeared around the nearest corner on the second floor. Out of sight but definitely not out of hearing. \"The girls told you?\" Bland, unfeeling, this was how she would have to play it if she was going to have a prayer of convincing him. \"Why Poppy?\" Each plea was another twist in of the knife in her stomach. \"Look Freddy,\" she would go with long thought out but not quite explainable conclusiveness \"You're sweet, and I really had fun in the times we were together. But this? It was just puppy love. \"Yeah it was fun, breaking the rules and running around under everyone's nose. After all, that's what I excel at. But eventually you realize that's all there is to it. The heat of the moment is over and there's nothing underneath. \"I was going to tell the girls but they were so worked up on the idea of us being together I thought it would be fun to still at least have what we did while I was here but...\" \"Say it!\" \"Huh?\" The interruption of her carefully chosen words had Poppy suddenly floundering underwater and she didn't know which way was up. \"Say You love him! Say I'm an idiot and what we had meant nothing to you!\" The words echoed and faded, leaving the hall quieter than an abandoned tomb. In Poppy's heart they rattled around like shrapnel of an atomic grenade that refused to just imbed in one part of her flesh and stay there. She was already dead inside. This would be her obituary to him. The words he would learn to bury in his heart and forget her by. An agonized mirror of all she wanted to say but now would never have the chance, after this he would hate her to much to listen again. \"I'm sorry that it had to come out this way but I didn't know how to tell you.\" I could never tell you how much you mean to me. \"But he's the one I want.\" You are the only one I will ever want. \"I love him.\" I love you. This warped reflection of her feelings was cruel beyond human comprehension. But it was the only words she could manage now. Anything else was beyond her. Say something. Anything. Say you hate me. Say you should have listened when others warned you about me. That I really was just an evil bitch. Just please stop looking at me with those eyes. Slowly, oh so agonizingly gradual, life came back into those beautiful eyes that she no longer had the right to gaze into so blatantly. But there was still nothing there. Just empty sorrow. 'I see,\" he said quietly. 'Sorry for causing this ruckus and wasting your time. Good day Mrs. Moors.\" He could not have picked a more heart retching way of ending it as he tuned and unceremoniously marched stiffly from the hall. Poppy waited till the sound of his engine faded in the distance before her legs gave out and she slumped back on the stairs. She was in to much shock to cry, to even feel… anything. The sound of clapping shook her back to her senses. There was only one creature who would find applause in this macabre farce. \"Well done Miss Moore. I must admit I am most impressed. To be perfectly honest I had thought you would be unable to pull it off, which would have been most disappointing in our standing of things. However it would appear you Californians really do have a bend for acting.\" Poppy scowled tiredly at demon now beaming sickly down on her. \"I did my part,\" she said. \"And quite admirably so. I do think Juliet would have been hard pressed to compete with such a display of restrained emotion. I almost shed a tar or two for you, truly, such devotions is laudable.\" Poppy wanted to strangle Harriet but was to worn out from the recent event s to do much more than put all her spite in the glare now trained on her. \"So it's over. The funding stays?\" Harriet finally took a brief respite from her daydream celebrations to remember the pitiful figure in a slumped stance still before her. \"Yes, yes, the funding stays. Now was that so hard?\" Poppy didn't bother with a retort. All she wanted now was peace and quite by herself to think how she could live with what she had just done. Ignoring Harriet's weird imaginations of which dress she should wear for her and Freddy's first date, she bolted to her room. If she stayed she knew she was gong to be sick, and Harriet's blouse was making a tempting target. I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you've dreamed of. So now she stood, empty, helpless, alone. It's how it should be. The girls, Kate and her Boyfriend. They all can continue on the way they were before I came. I'll go back to Malibu, tell dad I really tried. Try to make it up with Tara and see how it goes from there. Yes that would be the best. And Freddy? That annoying little voice just had to keep asking. And I wish to you, joy and happiness. But above all this, I wish you love. Finally unable to keep back the tears back any more than she could run after him and apologize. It was too late, wheels of fate had been set in motion add there was no undoing what had been done. Better just to forget him. That's what she had wanted him to do right? Forget this place she now called her home and her family. \"But it was worth it.\" She whispered to the gusts that would carry her words to him but not reveal her secret. \"For you my love it was worth it. So please take this chance I'm giving you. \"I free you from my heart in hopes you can one day forgive me this pain. I promise I have never loved anyone else. You are the one who showed me the true meaning of love and devotion. You showed me there was more to life than my superficial world that revolved only around me. \"So now I have this opportunity tot do something for you in return. My only request is you take it and live your life fully. Without the constraints being with me would have put on you. And I will always love you. I will always love you. Poppy blinked as the heavens opened as if hearing her hearts cry and joining in to pour upon the earth in a cacophony of flashes and explosions all in sync with the beat of her heart. The sound of my heart breaking. Poppy finally sobbed and sank to her knees on the edge. In the fading light the shadows below her stretched away in an unrestricted chasm. All that's left inside, nothing but a bottomless hole where my heart once was. She thought bitterly. Would it really be so wrong to disappear? Could they blame me for seeking an end to this pain? A large explosion off a thunder boom shocked through her. Causing her to jump in surprise and land back in a puddle. Wet, miserable, and too numb to care, Poppy Moore, once queen of all she laid eyes upon, now curled up on her side in the smallest ball possible. Unheedful to the world as she finally gave full vent to the blizzard of emotions ripping about inside herself. Goodbye… his name would never pass her lips again… Freddy You, my darling you. Hmm. I love you. Ooh, I'll always, I'll always love you. *Sits staring at the screen in her lap trying to figure out why she stopped typing* Hm? Oh, I finished the chapter? *reads over it* Well it's not MI6 material since I have been up for the last 30 hours and it is now ten past 10 in the morning and judging by the fact that my liquor stash is half gone I'll say I won't be surprised if it royally sucks. I had so much more to add but am absolutely terrible at romance as I have stated in my profile, evil conniving and plots are my specialty though and thanks to PrettyReckless09 I have lots of opportunity to work with that. But it's crazy late and I have an appointment in four hours with a friend about my new job so wish me luck and take pity on my half fried brain by reviewing, pretty please.[Chapter 21] TPD: *sniffs* So apparently I REALLY suck at melodrama since out Loki: Told ya, you were better off doing angsty blood and guts with me-self and the Avengers. TPD: True, out of almost four thousand hits I only got FIVE reviews *goes off into corner to mope*. Originally I had intended for Poppy to be listening to the song but it just didn't seem to fit, tell me if you think I should go back and change it. Lucky for you all I hate melodrama and am a firm believer in moving things along so I now give you the next chapter. Chapter XXI: You Order the Cavalry Special Ma'm? For the rest of the week Poppy remained in what amounted to social Siberia. None of her friends would deign to look at, much less speak to, her for more than was absolutely required, if even that long. Sensing a definite change in the social infrastructure and buckling under Harriet's snipes about the American, the other students studiously avoided Poppy, reinforcing her position of complete alienation. Why did you even bother coming back? All you got was this! Once again she mentally pushed aside that annoying voice in her head. Maybe if Headmistress saw Poppy wasn't fitting back in as well as originally perceived she would allow the girl an excuse to return to America. After all, it wasn't much of a leap to assume Mrs. Kingsley had been informed about the fight with Freddy. A girl who had broken her son's heart twice wouldn't stand a chance of staying on for much more than the first week or so unless they made up with lots of groveling. Obviously that would be out of the question for several years, if not ever, to come. It simply was not going to happen. Poppy and Freddy had broken up and this time there was no 'friendship superglue' to stick the broken pieces back together. He was gone. Forever. Curled up under the blankets Poppy bit the corner of her pillow to block off the sob building in her throat. Just two hours earlier she had gone to brush her teeth when she collided with Josie coming out of the bathroom. The girl had instinctively reached down to help up the fallen person before she saw who it was. Yanking back her hand like she'd accidentally stuck it in on an electric line, the girl turned and ran back to their room, leaving Poppy to stare miserably after her. A sudden flash of red broke into her self-pitying thoughts. Pulling down the covers a tad to see who could be the source, Poppy was perturbed to see four motionless forms still tucked snuggly in their beds. Huh? But no other thought could form before a sudden burst of red blinded her. Just as quickly it was gone. … The hell? Poppy gasped. Her answer was a soft taping on the window. Images from every horror movie she ever watched flashing through her head, Poppy slipped from under the covers and tiptoed to the window. Squinting through the glass she could just make out the shadows of the other side of the roof, the moonlight revealing an empty night. Whatever, if ever, had caused the lights was nowhere to be found. Putting down this small episode to emotional overload and lack of sleep, Poppy turned to head back to bed when something flicked in the corner of her eye. On the windowsill a small firefly perched, glowing brilliant crimson in the dark as it danced erratically in an effort to get out the window. But then it did go out the window… right through the glass. \"Wha….?\" Poppy mumbled, wondering if her snooze deprived brain was fully awake or hallucinating as a way of protest. But no, the light was back, and this time Poppy realized it was anything but natural, her stomach dropping through the floor panels. It was a red laser point. Sudden images of hired killers aiming their rifles with the aid of laser guides thudded sickeningly in her head. Surely Harriet wasn't insane enough to try having her murdered, or had aliens finally sucked out what was left of the nutcase's brain. She stood not daring to breath as the small point of light continued zipping around between the widow and the other side of the roof. After about half a minute of this the laser changed course to fall across her hand where it took up alternating flicks in the direction of the window. Almost like whoever it is wants me to open the window. Since her last confrontation with Harriet Poppy had grown to be even more wary of anything that breached the normality barrier. But oddly this didn't seem to fit Harriet's profile. Midnight visits with laser pointers? Surely not. Resigning herself to the fact that whatever was out there couldn't be worse than what she had put up with recently, Poppy carefully slid open the latch quietly as she could and pushed open the window. Sticking her head out, she looked in all directions but could see nothing. Abruptly the laser was back, dancing over her left eye before bouncing around randomly. Following the barely perceptible beam she followed it to the source, a small red pinpoint in the middle of a patch of black just a bit darker than the night. Fine! What the heck. Poppy squirmed out the window and cautiously approached the shadow. Seeing that she had finally picked up on its intentions the figure slid around the side of the roof away from the still open window. Poppy followed, curiosity finally overcoming her good sense. Being half asleep was probably helping. She followed the shadow that crept from corner to corner until it stopped and turned. \"So how's it swingin' Popsicle?\" \"Astrid?\" \"Expecting someone else now are we?\" The night shadows melted back under the bright glare of an LCD camping torch, illuminating the smirk that carried in the other girl's voice. \"Naughty, naughty. But at this height?\" Astrid grinned wickedly. \"How exactly would they plan on getting up? Rapunzel, Rapunzel! Let down thine luscious locks that I may carry thee hence from this fortress most depressing… OUCH!\" \"That's not funny!\" Poppy seethed. \"Ok, Ok…jeez, just having a little fun.\" The older girl grumbled and rubbed ruefully at her shin. Poppy breathed heavily, trying to get her temper under control. She hadn't meant to kick Astrid, but the insinuations picked away at the festering sore in her chest with heated skewers and she lost control. Astrid noticed the instability on her cousin's face and immediately forgot about continuing exaggerating the extent of her injury. \"Hey I'm sorry, I didn't mean… Poppy?\" \"Did you just come here to make fun of me?\" Poppy demanded in what she obviously thought was a steady voice. Astrid wasn't fooled. \"Poppy?\" Astrid asked in that careful tone one seems to use when regarding someone like a bomb about to go off or turn into a werewolf. Unaware of her cousin's change of tone Poppy carried on. \"I don't need you anymore so just go back home. I can take care of it myself…\" Whatever she had been planning to say was sliced off as her chin was grasped by firm fingers and tilted up into a set of dangerously narrowed eyes. \"Care to explain what's been happening since you called me?\" Poppy gulped. Darn she'd forgotten how scary her cousin was when aggravated. Two items sat prominently on Astrid's list of temper triggers, A: bullies, B: her overprotective complex for her family and friends. Both were the only symptoms that justified sudden, unrestrained violence in her eyes. And she had seen right through the melodrama. Releasing the smaller girl, Astrid leaned back casually against a corner of the roof. \"I'm not going anywhere so you had better cough up.\" Tell her, she can help. How Poppy wished that were true, but it was already too late. Not even Astrid could fix this now. \"It's really Ok, I've handled it. Sorry for being a bother.\" Even on her ears the words sounded flat and unconvincing. \"Goodnight.\" Strong hands arrested her move to return to the dorm window, and spun her roughly around to face an increasingly ticked off Astrid. \"You. Are. A. Terrible. Liar.\" She hissed each syllable. The tears had been obvious in Poppy's eyes the moment she mentioned secret rendezvous. At this close proximity she now saw what the shadows had masked. Pale, wane skin stretched over a too thin face, unkempt hair, and dark circles under eye shimmering liquid in the glare of the light. The only time her cousin had looked this bad was after her mother's death. The pure anger radiating of Astrid was finally too much for her mentally exhausted cousin. Finally, after a week of pressure, the cracks fractured. Throwing her arms around the taller girl's waist, Poppy didn't care what Astrid must think as she muffled her sobs in a warm shoulder. At least here was someone who wasn't going to take everything at face value just because she said so. Astrid stiffened sharply at the sudden invasion of her personal space, but then recognizing the need here relaxed and wrapped her own arms around her distraught cousin. Interesting thing sadness, it had been over ten years since Poppy used Astrid as a cry-time cuddle toy during the grieving period after her mother's death and four since either had really talked; yet here they were, like nothing had passed between them. \"Ok, it's gonna be Ok,\" Astrid soothed, muttering whatever consolation lines came to mind. Growing up with a military father had taught her emotional control. Past the age of ten crying was something you did in private if at all since it really didn't serve anything except to make you feel better, no reason to stick others in the awkward position of feeling compelled to commiserate with you. But that didn't mean she was a stone cold bitch. She could sympathize well enough and it was obvious Poppy was under a quite a bit of a rain cloud, emotionally speaking. It provided initiative to eradicate whatever self-inflating hoe was the cause. And hey, at least they were talking civilly, sort of. Finally Poppy ran out of tears to realize the jacket she'd been using as a hanky was now thoroughly soaked. \"T'awwy.\" She sniffed and tried using her shirt sleeve to dry her running nose to little avail. \"No biggy,\" Astrid shrugged but still kept Poppy in a hug since she still hadn't calmed down, \"looks like you really needed it and I'm gonna have to dump these clothes at the cleaners in the morning anyway. I love rain and all but this weather is downright evil .\" The comment got chuckles from both girls. \"No seriously, you'd better tell me what's happening or am I gonna have to kick down the door in the morning demanding answers of the first poor shmuck to get in my way?\" Having calmed down and feeling better to be able to finally let loose with a listening ear Poppy sat on the side of a roof slope and let the story of the last few days pour out, holding back no detail. When she was done she glanced up at Astrid who hadn't moved from her slouched position opposite her since she started talking. \"I know,\" Poppy sighed, imagining what must be running through her somewhat emotionally stunted cousin's head, \"I should have waited or called you. You must think I'm a complete idiot.\" \"Hm?\" Astrid jerked up. \"Oh, sorry, I was thinking. No, I wouldn't say you were an idiot. Rather commendable control on your emotions to pull off something like that I must say. Though on the one hand, yes, you should have talked to me first. \"I was basically ready to go the evening you called. Just waiting for a few goodies I ordered from a friend, but I would have told him to send them after me if I'd known the situation.\" Poppy drooped and nudged around a bit of loose tile with a bare toe, the last bit reminding her how cold it was out here. \"So basically I'm screwed?\" \"Naw, I wouldn't put it quite that way. Here,\" Poppy was surprised as a bundle of fabric fell around her ears, \"put that on before you catch a cold.\" The fabric turned out to be Astrid's jacket which was nowhere nearly as bad as she'd made it out to be, excepting one patch on the left shoulder of-course. Cheeks warming at the memory of losing her self-control, Poppy was still grateful for the added shield against the elements when she paused, \"Aren't you going to get cold without it?\" \"You're forgetting my loving affinity for the cold.\" Astrid reached down and finished stuffing Poppy's arms into the sleeves of the hoody. \" 'Sides, Skully here is fine for this kind of weather. The jacket was for the hood cuz I forgot to pack a beanie.\" Poppy's blush returned at needing help like a little kid but she couldn't help smirking. In the dark the large, manga style skull wearing a Goofy Jolly Rogers bandanna shone out clearly on her cousin's favorite black sweater. Trust Astrid to go for a recon trip dressed like she belonged on the livingroom couch singing Voltaire with Jack Skullington and Cap'n Sparrow. Deciding to ignore the apparel eccentricities, she instead focused on the previous conversation thread. \"What did you mean 'I wouldn't put it that way'? What about this situation is not completely in Hell's dustbin?\" Astrid heaved a half exasperated sigh as she plopped down next to Poppy. \"Well for one Harriet now thinks it's only a matter of time before you crack so she will be lowering her guard. Second, this provides perfect cover to your friends for what happens next. \"Actually screw that!\" Astrid jumped to her feet. \"This is all sending my evil bunny ears spinning thirty new ways to the Black Gate. I have to go!\" \"Where?\" Poppy's head swung like a pendulum as she tried to follow the other girls exited pacing. \"Where else?\" In the shadowy light Astrid's smile took on a decidedly disturbing gleefulness. \"To plot many and sundry nastily distressing, distressingly nasty things of course.\" Before Poppy could even wrap her hearing process around this last line Astrid was putting away the light and bundling her confused cousin back in the direction of the room window. \"Now off to bed with you. I have evil scheming to accomplish before the night is over.\" \"Wait!\" Poppy protested, suddenly scared at the idea of being left alone again in the hostile environment. \"What do I do?\" Astrid paused at the corner of the last roof slope before Poppy's. \"Get your beauty sleep and try not to let Dracula's Frankenstein attempt of a daughter notice something's changed in your game status. \"Oh here,\" she fished something out of her back pocket, \"when you get a chance you may want to read this.\" \"What is it?\" Poppy squinted at the small cube. It was a plastic case containing a computer chip. \"Everything you want to know.\" Astrid purred venomously. \"While it may not come as news for you, this case goes waaaaaay back before you. Just thought you might take comfort in the fact you're losing only because you're new to this game. \"Well goodnight, hope they don't have bedbugs or I'll have to add the dorms to my list of things to blow up before the end of this job.\" With a backwards wave, Astrid disappeared into the maze of night cloaked roofs. Feeling surprisingly better after the somewhat strange reunion, Poppy slipped quietly back into the room and closed the window. Climbing under the covers she suddenly realized she'd failed to return Astrid's jacket. Strangely she didn't feel like taking it off. The semi-thick material was blissfully warm and soft in stark contrast to her cold, stiff sheets. A light remnant scent of Axe: Instinct and the CK One Shock Astrid seemed to have upgraded to from One (she always had hated using perfume except for formal occasions), permeated the air, creating an unexpectedly warming little cocoon of comfort. Poppy wasn't sure why, maybe she was just happy to see some things still the same and (relatively) sane after all the recent upheavals her life had taken, but the cold iron claw in her gut was now gone and she could even breathe easy again. Snuggling deeper in the bed, she was presently surprised how quickly she became drowsy without mass mental agonizing. For the first time since her break-up with Freddy she was able to drift off to a refreshing sleep, lulled by the rhythmic snores of Drippy one bed over. Nya-ah, no shooting me. Loki finally listened when I told him I would be dancing in his area of expertise after this chapter so he finally (after stealing his cloak and leaving Mjolnir on his head for the weekend) agreed to help. But only if you all review. So go on and press that happy little blue button at the bottom of the page if you want more. 8P[Chapter 22] Chapter XXII: TA DAH! Had Harriet known the implications the small crossing of paths heralded she would have paid more attention to the girl dressed in khakis and a black, company logo stamped shirt. As it was she barely cast a questioning glance her way when they passed in the second floor hall, mind elsewhere in a fantasy that would have made the young man staring as the love interest shudder in utter horror. So it was not surprise that she also missed the hooded look of appraisal partially hidden by the blue ball cap pulled low over the eyes. The other girl didn't bother to stop either, keeping an even pace that slowed minutely as she observed the Head Girl as much as she could from the corner of the eye she managed to turn without being too blatant. Once the other was out of sight the pace picked up to the destination that had been carefully double-checked this morning while the school's occupants had been busy speeding up the rot of their innards with the crap that passed as morning sustenance in this place. The dorm hall traffic was at ideal flow at this hour, most of the residents busy with finishing up their homework before the evening meal. This meant there would be reduced witnesses to remember her face if the question were ever brought up but still enough that she wouldn't immediately stick out to anyone. Besides, who ever really bothered to remember what lowly delivery people looked like? …. Poppy hunkered down in at her desk and glared at the offending squiggles on the white background of her textbook. Geometry was the Devil. On the upside it was a good excuse to stop with keeping up the pretense to still be a beaten figure listlessly haunting her corner of the room. Whatever the hell Ash was up to had better be soon because now that she had a chance the resident raincloud of this past week was having a hard time finding usable excuses to put in an appearance and soon someone was going to catch on. A knock on the door broke the scholarly atmosphere. Reflexively all heads turned questioning looks in that direction. By simple proxy of being closest Kiki was the one who got up to answer. \"Delivery for Poppy More,\" the deadpan tone was like a lead blanket dropping over the room. Kiki turned to make sure Poppy was getting up to receive it then headed back to her desk. Poppy wordlessly got out of her chair and walked across the room to the girl who had set down the package so she could check her phone while holding out a clipboard with the delivery slip for signing. After signing the sheet Poppy passed it back, instead of taking it however, the delivery person continued hammering her thumbs on the screen of her phone while completely ignoring the increasingly irritated girl. \"Um, sorry but…\"the girl held up a finger in a 'one second' gesture. Poppy instantly felt a spark of that old privileged person anger she used to get back when she was still determined to act like the world's biggest brat and someone didn't seem to get the point. \"Excuse me, but I have…\" \"I'm sure your homework can wait girl face. This is more important.\" Poppy had no time to react to the shocking audacity before the other took it one step further by turning around and closing and locking the door. \"Same goes for the rest of ya 'orrible lot.\" \"Ash!?\" Poppy breathed somewhere between relief and shock as the cap came off to reveal her newest best friend. Last night the shadows had hidden much of the other so she hadn't been able to make out a whole lot of detail, but now in the light of day she almost didn't recognize the smugly grinning person before her. The last time Poppy had seen her cousin had been well over three years ago. Ash and her family had never failed to make an appearance for all requisite Christmas parties and social functions, but given her parent's lines of work the visits had been brief and Poppy always found some excuse to be absent during those times to avoid the clash she'd just known her previously assumed personality would have ensured- that the other girl always seemed to win. Fifteen-year-old Ash had been a bespectacled yet somehow still intimidating 5'4\" figure that always kept her unruly mop of fuzz tamed back into a long braid. Now the glasses were gone in favor of contacts, the hair had been cropped to a shoulder-length mane of gorgeous waves and curls that set off the natural dark auburn with golden highlights that the braid had always hidden, and she'd gotten fucking taller . Poppy now remembered why she had always been envious the few times Aunt Rene managed to twist her stubborn daughter's ear into dressing up for special occasions. Ash was a mix of the best traits from both her parents, her mother's beauty matched to her father's stubborn chin and strikingly distinctive eyes of gold and steel, which graced her with a combination which was both elegant yet commanding. A trait Poppy eternally wished she possessed. Despite having inherited her father's heavier bone structure, Ash had fortunately been rescued by her mother's genes in the curves department and somehow both seemed to complement each other rather well. Broad, powerful shoulders tapered down to a lean waist and long, eternally well toned legs. Despite her height, Ash had never been cursed with the mishap of disproportional limb-to-body ratio that was the fate of a large number of adolescents, and thanks to her father's training she had been athletic enough to kick any drill sergeant's butt since the day she learned to crawl. Even as much as five years ago a number of Aunt Rene's associates in the modeling side of the business had mistaken the then thirteen-year-old as much older and been more than willing to work with the fact she absolutely refused to do anything about never outgrowing a B cup, something that for some blasted reason did not detract from her appeal but rather added onto it. For a moment Poppy wondered if maybe it was possible she had suffered an early stage of inferiority complex at that age because of her cousin's appearance. \"Come on bitches, I ain't got all day. Move those arses, chop chop. We have evil scheming to be about.\" Aaaaand then she had to go and open her mouth and Poppy remembered why such was not the case. Despite her mother's many and varied attempts to cull her daughter's personality makeup, Ash had never made the popular list in any of her schools simple because of who she was. The natural confidence was a double edge sword. Ash quite simply did not care what people thought about her and even less about trying to fit in. She was like a mix of Dr. House meets random psycho females from her favorite anime Black Lagoon. Brash, cutting truths delivered where she knew would hurt most and cheerfully violent tendencies danced circles with charm and perfect etiquette only adhered to for the fun of screwing over one's mind because you will listen to her- thank you very much - if you liked your life or face (or balls) as it was. Either way was fine with her. \"Poppy,\" Kate eyed the newcomer warily, \"I take it this is your cousin?\" \"Yeppers!\" Ash flashed a grin like she was all but about to start bouncing off the walls. \"Let me guess, the fun roommate of the golden sunshine of falling in line and feeding one's young, impressionable minds with naught but what the most honored high dustbins dictate?!\" Poppy answered before a possible argument could spring up between the friend she hoped to get back and the one who was supposed to be helping her get said friend back. \"She's a Prefect.\" Ash gave a comical blink of pretended befuddlement. \"I do believe that is what I just said, except in greater and much more fun detail. \"All righty chikitas, up and at'em.\" Seeing the mutual glares of all the girls before her, Ash turned back with the same befuddled look, except this time with an element of fake questioning irritation. \"Will I be not incorrect in assuming you still have yet to cough up to the confessional chair then- or whatever they call it over here?\" Seeing the emotion denoting a negative, Ash turned and made a grand gesture with a deep bow to the others. \"Apologies ladies and good evening to all present. As some of you seem to know, my name is Astrid McArthur, no relation to the General, and I am here to clean up the mess created by my most beloved cousin, yet again .\" The last was emphasized with a small rolling flick of her head. \"The only mess she's in is the one she made by cheating on the boyfriend we risked expulsion to get her back together with because we were dumb enough to believe he was the only one she liked.\" \"Sensing high hostilities of the extreme quality type here,\" Ash chirped and grinned at the sour faced Josie. \"Now, if all you lovely people would be so kind as to pay homage to my next little trick, I shall endeavor to expunge this case to your satisfaction. \"Actually,\" she held up a finger with a look of cheerful contemplation, \"screw that. You're a bunch of idiots. Get your butts over here and sit down before I have to get more creative concerning the term 'you're gonna hear the truth one way or the other'. Personally I enjoy my way quite a bit, as Poppy may or may not have informed you.\" \"What are you doing?\" Poppy seethed. \"Helping, something you are in dire need of since you are the biggest numb nut of the lot.\" Poppy glared, \"What happened to 'you handled the situation quite well'?\" Ash threw her an apathetic look. \"I was being nice. You, honey, are an idiot .\" \"Well, this has been a very… er, interesting and, I'm sure, touching family reunion. But we've got homework to finish and I'm sure you're not even an authorized guest. So if you don't mind…\" Kate's lecture was cut off midsentence as Ash's eyes turned to the younger girl who crossed her arms in an attempt maintain the air of being cross and in a superior position. \"Kate,\" Ash said in a deceptively calm tone. \" Shut up and sit down . \" Poppy felt her spine straighten as if someone had poured cold water down it and over the room, freezing whatever attitude was building. There it was. Ash's one truly defining nature. Not charm- she sucked at that, or superior intelligence to wow the masses (well, unless you counted her blend of psychoanalysis and destruction of a person's secrets), nor astounding beauty- there was more than a plethora of pretty faces to compete there, and her personality was over the line into what some might call questionable so that was out. What made people listen to Ash was the same thing that caused gullible idiots to set fire to their city and blame hundreds of innocents for having a different belief system all in the name of a fat little psychopath or stake their country's future on a dwarf with personal fashion issues as they had a teenage girl centuries before. And which guarantied her image primping cousin dissolving into a squirming mass during any and every altercation. It wasn't long years of experience-learned calm and mannerism like Mrs. Kingsley or Queen Bee bitchery like what Poppy used to employ. Ash was way too rough around the edges to put on airs unless she was playing an angle. She was in control, plain and simple. She didn't ask and she didn't have to- nor did she intend to. It was that kind of unshakable firmness that made everyone else feel like they'd run into a steel wall and they had better get with the program, or by god there would be more ways than Jacob Marley had chains to make you fall in line. And on top of it was her own personal brand of humor. Poppy would have loved to watch Harriet try the 'hierarchy' speech with Ash, which would be amusing not to mention extremely gratifying to see the fuggly biatch put in her place with a laugh at her expense. Actually Ash would most likely practice field hockey on the grass just for the fun of it afterwards. Cartoon pillow in one hand, katana in the other was probably a pretty good description of her take on dealing with people. Speaking softly really wasn't her thing and she had a tendency to break most of her staffs within a few months of getting them. That being said, it wasn't such a shock to the younger cousin when her previously mouthy roommate promptly shut her trap and was quickly joined on the edge of her bed by her three friends who clustered together in mild consternation on how to go about dealing with this new entity in their midst. \"If nothing else you might just learn something about human deviousness capacities.\" Ash grouched as she spun a newly vacated chair around and straddled it. Poppy wanted to stay near the girl who had become her new lifeline but wasn't sure if she was still allowed seating rights on any of the other girl's beds so retreated to her own for now. \"Ok, nutshell, Harriet is a complete wacko- I say that because she is that much of an insult to psychos, a guild I am happy to admit to being a member of- but a very rich wacko. Her parents' bi-annual donations comprise almost a third of your school's scholarships and she threatened to have them pull the plug unless Poppy voluntarily orchestrated her own fall from grace.\" \"What?!\" Ash sighed at the dumfound looks of disbelief meeting her statement. \"Poppy no go bye bye, blind bling say bye bye. You understand?\" Kate scowled at the actually decently done Chinese accent. \"The Harriets are alumni with five generations connected to this school. Do you really expect us to believe this pollywog that they would just… up and drop the school because their daughter asks them to?\" \"You obviously have an overestimated sense of respect for the Harriet family where their daughter is concerned. Poppy, do you have that chip I gave you?\" Poppy wasn't surprised that Ash hadn't so much as batted an eyelash at the Prefect's outburst and scrambled to retrieve the jacket she had tucked under her blanket when making her bed that morning. In the pockets she found the familiar square of plastic and handed it over to her cousin who tossed it to her captive audience. \"School counselor reports, records from several nanny services, a school board meeting concerning an art teacher's 'lack' of classroom safety measures just six months prior to everyone's favorite hottie joining you illustrious elite, and last but not least a school and police report dating over two years ago for a drug incident that you probably know about along with the toxicology test results. \"Oh, and a listing of the school finances. Pay particular attention to the places I highlighted concerning where the Harriet's donations go.\" \"How did you…\" \"Know where to look?\" Ash smiled at her cousin's surprise. \"Pops, if there is only one thing my old man ever managed to pound into my gray matter it's to never go into a fight half cocked… unless they come flying at you- in which case an extreme case of improvisation comes in very handy.\" \"That too, but I was going to ask how you got all this information. It's not exactly public knowledge.\" Again Ash got that devious look in her eyes. \"You always asked my reason for spending so much time in the IT room at mom's company? Ta Dah! Behold! The awesome powers of nerds let loose upon an ever dumb-ing down planet. \"Seriously, security in this country sucks and the camera galore does not make up for it. It took me less than five minutes to get into the police records.\" One thing Poppy couldn't fault her cousin for. Ash might be a sociopath, but she was still smart as a whip with good observation skills and an imagination. Looking in places most people wouldn't think to was something she more than excelled at and she wouldn't just stop at the surface, she'd excavate all the way to the bottom if that's what it took and here were the results. \"Now, back to the issue at hand.\" Everybody couldn't help a very minor glare at the girl who seemed quite bent on making the Cheshire cat look like a clown with a toothache. \"You can keep pointing fingers and get nowhere, or you can stop and use whatever parts of your brains are actually developed and think for a moment about why Poppy did what she did. Of course I'm not excusing her for being an idiot,\" here Ash turned an annoyed glower at the girl in discussion. \"She and I are overscheduled for a very long talk.\" Yeah, I take that comment back, Poppy glared. She'd forgotten Ash considered anyone who didn't think things through with multiple details and possible scenarios coordinated into the equation an idiot. To Ash emotions were a terrible deciding factor. \"Your intentions were good,\" Poppy couldn't help feeling just a bit smaller under Ash's cool look of appraisal. \"Your methods, however, sucked.\" Poppy had to bite the inside of her lip to stop the retort trying to get out. Ash always did this every time she screwed up. \"Your problem, as usual, is you don't stop to think .\" \"I didn't exactly have a choice here!\" Poppy jumped up and stood almost nose to nose with her infuriating cousin. Ash made a sound like a game show buzzer. \"Rule one Poppy- the ultimate rule of life; there is always more than one choice. You just need to look for it.\" It was the same speech Ash always threw at her. Slapping the hand connected to the finger wagging in her face, Poppy turned to walk back to her bed. \"Yes, walk away. You're the queen bee. The ultimate bitch who doesn't care what other people think of her. Oh wait, I forgot. \" You don't have that mask anymore honey! \"H-okay, moving on.\" Everyone jumped as Ash clapped her hands together loudly. \"The main reason I am here, as you recall, is to help dig skeletons out of everyone's favorite prima donna's closet and that is precisely what I intend to do.\" Everyone looked stumped at Ash's sudden change of subject while Poppy just glared. Ash had said what she needed to. In her mind it was up to Poppy what she would do with it. Now they could get on the real business at hand. \"And what makes you think we're gonna help you?\" Ash smiled with impish patience at the sulking Kiki. \"Because, my dear girl, even if you still don't believe me about cousin dearest here, you're still going to go along with it just for the heck of seeing Harriet breaking a rung, or several, on the ladder of image and grace. \"Am I right?\" So sorry for the wait. My plot bunnies have been on strike since Arrow turned into an ethics bitch. My inspiration is finally back and we're going to get into all kinds of trouble… crap now I can't say that without people thinking I'm quoting Hunger Games- the most horrid rip-off of Battle Royal grrrrrrrrrr *storms off to toss Gale and the other annoying fake-blond dude in the charrie cage to introduce to Alucard later*. Another reason my bunnies were on strike. Well if you like it or hate it, leave a note and we'll see if I can induce the bunnies to work even though we're suffering post winter depression with all this heat.[Chapter 23] Yes, I know Ash is the atom bomb no one was expecting. But me predecessor lay down a basic storyline criteria which I am trying to follow. Unfortunately there was no way I could conceive any of the original characters pulling off a feat of this magnitude without some serious divine interference. Chapter XXIII: One Down, One To Go. \"I can't believe you managed to talk them into sticking with the original plan.\" Ash waved a hand even though her cousin wasn't there to see it and responded in a manner that was too cheerful to fit the reprimanding tone. \"My poor, poor cousin,\" she smiled brightly, \"the only obstacle in your way, like most of this earth's sad population, is your appalling lack of imagination. I won't expect you to understand about reading human nature since you barely scraped basic psychology last year.\" How the fuck does she know about that? Poppy wanted to ask, but the still frosty glares she could feel on her back from the other occupants of the room easily made the decision for her to wait for a more appropriate time. Although the girls had found Ash's logic undeniable they were adamant about waiting for Kate to do a bit of digging of her own before they made a more solid decision to believe this new theory that had been so abruptly dropped in their laps. Ash of course hadn't bothered to wait and was now on phase two of her master plan. Poppy, of course, was all thirty yards of pessimistic sunshine and recent life lessons soured bunnies. \"Gotta go,\" Ash suddenly said breezily. \"Target acquired.\" \"Target!?\" Poppy started to panic. \"Ash what…\" Too late. Her erratic cousin had already hung up. \"Damn you Ash!\" she seethed and glared at the innocent looking piece of plastic in her hand as if it was somehow the phone's fault. \"You'd better not be doing something stupid again. Ash was doing something stupid. Well, stupid in the way most people would consider such an idea. But the way she saw it, they were ten times dumber for not doing it. Right now she was sitting in a boys' dorm. To be more specific, she was sitting in a chair in a boys' dorm in a boys' school in the room occupied by the dweeb her cousin was pining so desperately for. Yeah, most people would consider this rather stupid. But then they weren't her and they would never have the brains much less the bravery to take this confrontation so candidly. This, in her opinion, was why there was so much damn misunderstanding in the world. Because people were too scared to dig around in the back of the closet for fear of hurting someone else's precious feelings or being wrong. Or worse, right. Of course there was also the detail of people just being too dumb to want to scratch beneath the surface. Goddamn, why do humans have to be so annoying? Her grouching was finally relieved as sound filled the hall outside. Soccer practice ended ten minutes ago. It was about time they got here. This should be fun. NOT! Ever since the crushing breakup with Poppy, Freddy had decided to lay off the romantic scene indefinitely and instead throw himself completely into his studies and sports and just anything in general to keep his mind from the girl who had so casually broken his heart. This was why he was so intent on listening to Matt's brilliant new scheme for a play that he utterly failed to notice the person sitting by his desk until it was too late. He stared, she looked bored. Then he realized what had just happened and felt his face flame redder than Rudolph's nose in a blizzard. \"Nice boxers,\" Ash smirked. This was not her first time dealing with odd situations and she'd known from very early on that one of the best ways to get the upper hand at the start of a confrontation is to catch the other person in an awkward, preferably highly embarrassing, situation. Going unseen as she was, sitting in the corner silently waiting for the boys to notice her, Freddy had acted as most guys did when they enter their room sweating after a workout. Freddy gulped as he took in the lightly mischievous twinkle in the girl's eyes and wondered if it wouldn't make him look too conservative or self-conscious to reach down and pull up the pants pooled around his ankles. The only female to ever see him in nothing more than underwear was his mother, and not since the age of twelve when hormones ushered in a sense of propriety to at least be acceptably decent in front of a lady. Matt, the bastard, seemed to find the situation highly amusing and let out a snicker. \"Shove up mate; you're blocking the way…\" Of course Daniel just had to pick that precise moment to make an appearance. Shoving Matt to get past him, he sent his roommate stumbling into Freddy from behind. Still being in a state of mortified shock Freddy had no warning to brace himself for the impact, and with his legs still tied up in his pants he had no prayer of avoiding the ensuing fall. Ash couldn't help her smirk creeping a bit higher on one side of her face. Barely a minute in and the guy was already sprawled at her feet. Ok, enough with the reveling at other people's discomfort. If she made the boy too uncomfortable he might clam up and the whole exercise would be counterproductive. \"I'm Ash.\" \"Freddy.\" \"Nice to meet you Freddy. Cute boxers.\" Ash smiled a full impish grin this time as the boy scrambled about, trying to stand and pull his pants up at the same time. Apparently he must have decided modesty was more important than any message the action might convey at this point in time. Both his roommates also looked to be a bit unsure of the state of affairs as they too were unintentionally shirtless in front of an unknown female. Most girls in her place would have probably been at least a teensy bit less unperturbed. Maybe tittered a bit, maybe blushed but still snuck glances. If it were a cheerleader they may have been more bold and stared openly. Ash, however, did none of the above. When one spends a good deal of their evenings grappling with men much more physically attractive than these boys and who wore nothing but hand wrappings and shorts smaller than Freddy's previously displayed boxers this wasn't even tickling at disconcerting. \"I spar with MMA fighters who wear less than that. Drop the chauvinist drag and sit. We need to talk.\" Perhaps it was the utter lack of concern about their situation. Perhaps it was the bland tone that still somehow held the breath of a threat. Or maybe it was being called chauvinists. All three boys did not argue and sat on beds and a chair to face her in a half circle after closing the door. Seeming to find his tongue with the comfort of their numbers, Matt decided to break the silence. \"American?\" \"Yes.\" Still the same bland response. \"You here about Poppy?!\" The other two boys tried not to wince at sour accusation Freddy spat out. But they could more than understand his pain and were determined to stand by their friend. \"Well,\" Ash smiled, pleasantly this time. \"Shall we cut to the chase then? \"Harriet's parents are the largest alumni sponsors of Abbey Mount. Their delightful little jackanapes has decided to clear up her competition by threatening to have her parents pull the school funding unless Poppy broke up with you.\" \"Nice try.\" \"Stop the act…\" \"That bitch put you up… \"What the hell is a jackanapes?!\" Ash sighed and flicked a pencil at Daniel's head, promptly shutting both up quite effectively. \"You don't want to see what happens when I try acting, Poppy would kill me if she knew what I was doing right now. And a jackanapes is a rather more interesting description than 'bitch'. It also means a trained monkey.\" \"What do you think Freddy?\" Matt finally asked, after he managed to get his head around the girl's fast pace talking in the same insipid tone until becoming quite cheerful at the part about a monkey, not sure if he'd been subtly insulted. Freddy, who hadn't said a word the entire time, no stood. \"This is poppycock.\" Unfortunately his attempt to turn and walk away, the picture of distraught rage, failed marvelously as he once more found himself spitting out carpet fibers- courtesy of a foot hooked expertly around his ankle. \"I'm mad and mortally wounded. The girl I thought I could give my heart to and spend the rest of my days in a haze of fluff, pink clouds with tiny cherubs watching over us went and took a well placed stiletto heel to my idealistic fantasies. Now they lie shattered like a million tiny daggers, never to be whole again. As the pain slowly poisons my mind and outlook on life. \"Yes! I am familiar with the routine very well, thank you.\" Sympathy for Ash was like fries to a super model, only to be allowed on certain very singular occasions. This was not close to making the cut. \"If you want to go hide in the corner of a sandbox and mope about the cruel reality of life, be my guest. But do me the herculean favor of taking a millisecond to think about what I've just said and weigh the facts.\" Maybe it was just the subconscious knowledge that stopping him from leaving was as easy for the girl before him as breathing, but Freddy remained sitting where he was, glaring. Out of boredom, Ash picked up a piece of paper which was Freddy's history report and began folding it into a plane. The boy, if he had any sense at all, would listen to her advice and consider what she'd laid before him. If he just ran off… well, she could work with that and come back another time. But he would be losing a lot of points on her scale of human competence, which might mean she'd might not bother and rather find a way to wean Poppy off him. Though that would suck because she really wanted a stab at Harriet from this direction as well. \"Why are you doing this?\" Ash glanced at Matt with a mournful gaze. \"Because she'd my cousin and this is what families do. Well, at least in my wonderfully screwed up and very loving family with the odd habit of getting into the most strangely cumbersome of situations life enjoys cooking up for everything we do. What about yours? Ever had that problem?\" Leaving the boy sputtering for an appropriate response after the perky direction her questions took, Ash turned her attention back on the one she'd come to confront. It would seem her little show with his roommate had drawn his thoughts from the anger. Now he looked like he still really wanted to be angry but her words were hanging around like a bad cold in the North Pole. Ash easily picks out the second the first piece fits itself together in the boy's mind. Gradually more follow, a light slowly filters into his eyes and she can almost see the thoughts whizzing around in his head as hope grows. But then, a cloud is back as common sense tempered by a previous hurt speaks its part. Well, she tried, and it would seem she'd managed a bit more than a foot in the door. Not as much as she wished, but she'd start there. \"You're saying… she was protecting the school?\" Ash continued to say nothing. When trying to convince someone it's generally best to let them connect the dots so that there would be no room to accuse of manipulation later on. For a moment Freddy looked as if he was going to say more. But then he closed his mouth and glared. \"You really expect me to believe that?\" Ash shrugged unconcerned and fiddled with the nose of her plane. The boy was getting there, but, in keeping with her stance on not letting him blame her of leading him on, there were a few things she'd prefer not having to talk him through herself. \"How do you expect me to believe such a flimsy story?\" Ash finally deigned to glance at the boy in a mildly sarcastic matter-of-fact way, \"because it's true?\" \"Nice act,\" Daniel stated drily. He had been just as shocked at the turn of events. He remembered Poppy's excitement the night they'd sneaked her in here to finally see Freddy after all his avoiding her. He had no idea what went down between the two when Freddy rushed out to confront Poppy after a furious call from Kate, but Freddy's sorrow had been unmistakable. It had been nothing short of alarming when his new friend came staggering back in tears and failed to speak for the next two days. This time Ash's smile was more than frightening. \"Do you want to know why I said you don't want to see me acting?\" Not waiting for a confirmation she answered. \"Because when I act, I don't give you a nice pat on the back and tell you it's because some people fail miserably in thinking things through. I use every sense of your pride for ghoul training toys and laugh as I watch you squirm from the flood of 'if I only had's.\" \"If…?\" \"If only I'd stopped and really thought it through! If I'd only not jumped to conclusions! If I'd only not taken everything at face value! If I only had just a bit more faith in them! If only I'd acted a bit more rational! If I only I had bothered to scratch just a tiny bit beneath the surface! Getting it now?! Or do I need to drag your ass through a show and tell as well?\" \"Show and…\" \"Tell me something Mr. Kingsley. Has your mother ever discussed the sponsors of the school with you? Talked specifically about the Harriet's contributions, what they're used for, who is the generally the first to offer support for unexpected or new enterprises?\" \"You're not trying to say that Poppy really thought the school was more important to me than her?!\" Freddy was finding a headache forming in his skull and a pit in his gut as his emotional state jumped from angry, to confused, back to pissed off, and round again. \"Who knows? My best guess? She believes your mother is also very dear to you and the school is very dear to your mother. While she may or may not have the confidence that your mother wouldn't put a building and her students over her son's happiness, I do think it crossed her mind, in some very annoying manner I'm sure she failed to quiz you on, you might put your mother's happiness above the girl around which is centered all the recent commotion in your lives.\" Ash wondered for a moment at the wisdom of notifying Freddy he now resembled a goldfish. Opening and closing his mouth like he wanted to speak, but shock wasn't about to let him off the merry-go-round quite yet. Sighing, she gave him a few minutes before tossing the now finished plane to Matt and stood. The boy was no good for a discussion at the moment. She'd let them marinate in their brain juices for awhile and come back later. \"What do you want?\" The quiet demand surprised Ash halfway out the door. A small smile played on her lips, the boy wasn't as thick as most people she was forced to deal with. There just might be hope for this one yet. Leaning on the doorframe she met the grey eyes swarming with confusion. \"Well, for one, I would like to exonerate my cousin from accusations about the fire. Then I would like to dig a confession out of this girl Harriet. And, of course, clearing up this ugly business between you two would be a plus, but I'll be keeping my reservations about hopes in that area for now.\" \"It's not just us you'll have to convince,\" Daniel said. He didn't want to, but the girl made sense, even if her advocating skills were not the most polished. \"You'll also be needing…\" \"Already been to see the nest over there. The other girls are in.\" \"We'll need proof of that.\" Apparently Freddy had finally gotten tired of the floor and stood to sit back on his bed. Smiling, Ash pulled out her phone and redialed the last call. \"Are you crazy!? Do you want me to get caught with this thing?\" Ash's smile just got bigger. \"Then you should have turned it off when not using my dear. Are the rest of the hen peck around?\" \"Yes,\" was the uncertain reply. \"Why?\" \"Tell them to come over and put your phone on speaker.\" Ash pushed away from the door, closed it, and picked up Matt's chair. Placing he furniture in the middle of the room at an angle so the back would not block anyone, she followed her own instructions to Poppy then placed the phone on the chair. \"Ash?\" came the voice of the Kate as Ash reclaimed her seat on Freddy's chair. \"What's going on?\" \"Evening ladies.\" Ash greeted cheerfully. \"Everyone comfy?\" \"We're all here Ash.\" Poppy's tone told her cousin that, while nowhere near even amicable camaraderie, things were much improved from the last time they'd talked. \"Kate? Is that you?\" Ash rolled her eyes at the dude's eager tone. You didn't need to tell her what the relationship there was. \"Daniel?\" was the confused reply. \"What's going…\" \"AAAAAAASH!\" Everyone on both ends, minus screamer and target, jumped at the infuriation of the outburst. \"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!?\" \"Fine, thank you, lovely to hear from you too Popsicle. And in answer to your query, digging you out of the metaphorical avalanche of course.\" Everyone looked between the cousin on their end, then the phone, then back again. With a sigh the girls resigned themselves to what they knew was going to be a long conversation, while the boys were just getting an inkling they may want to invent a way to duck a fight between people that weren't even in the same vicinity. Eventually Daniel decided to be the one to take on the arduous task of mediating the two groups. \"Kate, Ash says Poppy set this whole thing up to stop Harriet getting her parents to pull school support. Is this true?\" The question hung in the air like an invisible Dark Mark. No one really wanted to know, because of what implications it might mean. But simultaneously they couldn't bear not to know. \"Yes,\" Kate finally said. \"I managed to get a glimpse at Mrs. Kingsley's records. They match to the files Ash gave us. Also Harriet's parents made an unannounced visit two days before Poppy's… call. Supposedly to check how things were going after the fire. \"Harriet… did seem awfully smug, more so than usual, after that. And, according to Charlotte, she has been in stunningly good spirits this past week.\" Kate glanced fleetingly at Poppy before joining her other friends in committing every detail of the most fascinating piece of technology on the chair to memory. \"Damn it!\" Daniel reached up to massage the bridge of his nose. He'd come here in the hopes of being able to restart a nice, quiet full-time relationship with Kate. Yet in the first two weeks alone he'd snuck a chick into the school- helping to restart that relationship, watched said relationship take a freefall nosedive, had to comfort the first truly heartbroken person he'd ever had to deal with, and now this. Why couldn't he and Kate catch a break already? \"Alright.\" On the other end of the phone Poppy held her breath, not daring to believe the tiny whisper that floated over the air through the tiny speaker. \"Alright what?\" Ash prompted, maintaining a perfectly straight face. \"Alright, I'll give you the benefit of doubt here. If you can get me proof that Harriet really did put you up to this Poppy, I'll forgive you.\" BONK! CRASH! \"OWWW!\" Ash's rage would have boiled the blood and melted the very bones of the boy rubbing his head and posterior in a manner of wounded dignity. \" When we prove her right you'd better be ready to get down on your knees to perform some serious exhibitions of gratitude, and maybe a little groveling for forgiveness regarding the mental and emotional distress you caused her pal !\" Even several miles and a completely different school away the collective residents of the room where Poppy resided all cringed at the incensed tone. That was to say nothing of the three boys trying their upmost to shrink into little balls in hopes of riding out the tirade mostly intact. Luckily for them Ash was more than accomplished at keeping a tight lid on her emotions and the beast was sealed away as quickly as it had appeared before it led her to draw unwanted attention to the room. \"Ok, we have a plan to white rabbit miss little 'Queen of hearts', but we're gonna need a couple of knaves to, well, steal the tarts so we can go after the crown jewel while the court is looking the other way, metaphorically speaking. Know where I can get a couple of those?\" It took a little while for the boys to stop cringing. But after they did a look passed between them. Not all of them had known each other for long, but that was not a barrier to reading what was on the others' faces. With a nod of understanding, Freddy stood and faced Ash. \"What do you want us to do?\" The confidence didn't stop him shuddering when Ash smiled gleefully like a shark on a blood high. \"Let the games begin.\" So Ash is a right handful and not the most empathetic creature in the jungle, but she has been around longer and knows the rules a lot better which is why she is necessary to break them. Don't worry. Poppy, Freddy, and co. get a little payback for her lack of vanilla humanity later. Comments please, or I shall be forced to set my new Richard the Dead Wizard squishable upon you and your village foolish mortals.[Chapter 24] Sorry it takes so long. Work is a soul sucking evil that kills inventiveness. Chapter XXIV: Groundwork Harriet was mildly concerned. Poppy had been a wet blanket the majority of the week after her break up with Freddy. Yet it seemed in the last two days she'd stopped navigating the halls via floorboards. Also, Harriet's brilliantly planted bug seemed to have been dislodged somehow and ended up in Matron's dustbin. If Harriet was any more paranoid she might have believed her rival was plotting something. However, that was hardly the biggest issue on her mind at the moment. \"What's all this then!?\" Charlotte shrugged noncommittally. \"These were just delivered. They're for you.\" Harriet would never admit she took the small bouquet and the candy box with anything less than perfect dignity. Setting aside the chocolates, she opened the card and read, \"To the most unforgettable girl in the world.\" \"Well, who's it from?\" Harriet flicked a smug little grin at Jane. \"It does not say.\" \"Ooohhh, a secret admirer then?\" Charlotte came around to try getting a glimpse of the card. \"It would seem so.\" Harriet primly closed and set the card down. \"Think it's from Freddy?\" Harriet's eyes lit up like a starving dog tossed a succulent bone. \"You think so?!\" Not bothering to wait for a reply, she tore open the box and picked out one of the delectable candies. \"Mmm, well, it's not like there are many other boys who would know my preference of chocolates.\" Had she been just a little less occupied with the sudden fantasies of Freddy trying to make amends for his heinously erroneous choice of thinking Poppy courting material, she might have noticed the lack of banter from her normally eager-to-opinionate roommates. Behind her, Jane and Charlotte shared covert glances and tried not to grin. Several hours before… \"I fail to see how this is supposed to cause her vanity any kind of damage.\" Charlotte eyed the box of chocolates speculatively. It looked perfectly innocent. In fact, it looked extremely nice for a simple box of candy, quite a bit fancier than could be found in even the high class boutiques she occasionally visited in London for very special occasions. \"Are you planning, like, a 'build her dreams up, then bring them smashing down with the reality' Trojan Horse?\" Ash spared her cousin a bemused glance of sympathy. \"You think too small Popsicle. \"Nope, these are a little more fun, and a little- ok, a lot more evil. Whatever you do,\" she looked sternly at Harriet's three roommates gathered before her, \"do not eat these.\" \"Care to elaborate?\" Jane asked. \"Because Karma's a bitch, that's why. I figured we'd give your beloved princess a taste of her own medicine.\" \"Ash,\" Poppy allowed the worry that was starting to creep up filter into her tone, \"what did you do?\" \"Ever been to Amsterdam?\" \"No way!\" Kate looked equal parts horrified, shocked, and impressed. \"You didn't…\" \"Well, they're not actually from the Netherlands, since customs are annoyingly restrictive in their paranoia about cannabis candy. There's this guy in Milan that does his dealing by putting the weed in the exclusive order list he makes at his chocolate store.\" \"And you know about this how ?\" Ash cast sympathetic glance at the suspicious Kate. \"My mom is a designer who caters very specifically to those with the bling, honey.\" \"So, money runs in the family I take it? Like the Harriets\" Ash snorted at the analogy attempt. \" Please , those small fry? Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada- wanna know what they all have in common? They can all trace their origins to the same place. \"That's right, both our mommas' side of the family.\" Anyone in the room who hadn't been following Ash's erratic gesticulating now swung around to apply their full attention to the conversation. \"You're…\" \"…Not joking,\" Ash appeared to be calmly inspecting her nails. \"You'd be very surprised at the things we've got going on in the family tree. All those stories you hear about royal diplomatic marriages and schemes pale compared to what our clan cooked up. I love family politics.\" \"And how does that apply to where the… weed… came from?\" Poppy was immeasurably grateful of Drippy's ability to completely miss such an earth-shattering revelation in favor of noticing instead the deviation of the path of information. \"We're pretty much the one who set the precedent for the modern who's-who party structure. Playing pharmacy for these shindigs was just something that rolled in with the tides.\" Every girl in the room's eyes could clearly be seen marking 'X's on Ash's forehead. \"But your dad's in…\" \"Different country sweetie, different jurisdiction. So long as he doesn't see it, he doesn't have to report it. And actually, cannabis is driving the modern medical community bananas with all these remedial pluses after all the years they've tried toting it as a harmful substance. Money grubbing scumbags.\" \"So you want her to take a fall for drugs and showcase how she made the plan to paint Mia as an addict, all in one?\" Ash's smile was as far from settling as could ever be imagined. Present… Harriet smiled serenely as she nibbled on a second chocolate. These were so good . She couldn't help the desire for more; but she didn't want to just shovel these down like some grubby faced child. Instead, she carefully locked the box in her dresser drawer. She didn't believe they would be so bold; but just to be sure, she didn't want to chance anyone somehow wandering in and taking any. Especially not Matron with her Scottish prissiness and suspicion to check anything left lying around. Not that it would matter. If Freddy wanted to make up then there would be more than plenty of chocolate to come. But these were the first. Special. She wanted to savor them as long as possible. Far and above Cloud Nine, Harriet giggled and waved to her roommates. The sun was shining, Moore was on the way out, Freddy was finally coming back to her, and she was sure there was chocolate ice-cream in the pantry freezer. She'd never done it before, but she was fairly certain she could either slip or talk her way past any of the kitchen staff that might there. No one- repeat, NO ONE - was getting between her and that glorious milky smoothness. Humming what she believed a charming pass on the Pirates of the Caribbean theme, she primly strode out the door; only lightly snarling 'get out of my way' when she nearly ran over Elena on the way. The looks shared between all three girls behind her back missed entirely. So, random info got pasted together. Sorry it's so short. I have tests to concoct for this semester's finals to torment my students with. Feedback is love. And yes, there is a more detailed explanation to come of how Ash got the girls to go along with her plan.[Chapter 25] Will apologizing for being busy with life help? No! Thought not, you wouldn't get one anyway. Chapter XXV: Patience \" IT'S DRUGS! \" Ash heaved a silent long-suffering sigh as she placated Kate furiously hissing so as not to be overheard. \"Yes, but you can stop sweating. There is no more than two grams in that whole box. Not enough to get her high, but being that she's never done weed, not to my research knowledge, it should elevate to a relative state of euphoria, which will work in our favor. \"That's just a plus. What I'm really after is the effects from the THC in the weed.\" \"THC?\" Kiki, the geeky one, was more willing to acquiesce for science reasons and latched onto the abbreviation. \"It's the chemical that causes users to experience a raise in appetite.\" \"So we're basically giving her a case of the munchies?\" Poppy was not sure how she felt about this either. \"Sort of.\" Ash elaborated. \"It affects the receptors in the brain for emotions, pain, memory, and appetite.\" She smiled. \"All things we're aiming to screw with. \"Look,\" she waved a hand, \"just trust me on this, alright. We want to start slow and monitor her reaction to this amount.\" \"You're not planning to raise the amount, are you?\" Kate sounded horrified and not unlike she was severely rethinking this plan. \"I will calibrate it according to what I observe. If it's too much I'll give you the box with a lesser dosage to replace all the candies left in the box. And yes, I do have one with no weed and just plain Dronabinol in it.\" \"Dro-ni…beenol?\" \"It's another name for a pure isomer of THC… just the chemical itself.\" Ash answered Josie inquiry. \"Guys, let's just trust her on this one.\" Poppy sighed. \"If anyone knows this stuff it's her. They had to change her to a school that offered advance classes as far back as junior high.\" She twitched her head at her cousin with a touch of her old sass. \"I'm assuming that nothing has changed.\" Ash smirked slightly. \"Grade skips for History and English in high school, twice. Science, Tech, or Military camp one month of summer in exchange for another month studying a martial art in its country of origin every year since I was twelve- my favorite being biology. Graduated a year early at sixteen with A+ in all categories and an invite to Mensa- which I turned down on the count that the majority of their measuring sticks are based in assumed relatives, and they're just plain boring. \"That and no one wanted to discus spiritualism or metaphysical energies as a possible reality.\" \"Didn't your dad want you to apply to like, Harvard or something for some kind of science major or something?\" \"Psychiatry and chemical engineering or biochemistry; people always were a subject I enjoyed dissecting.\" Ash said with a low yawn. \"I enjoy the science, but I don't want to do it for a living. Plus I don't get to hit anyone. I think he's just hoping he'll be able to recruit me into the business when I graduate.\" She waved a hand. \"Enough about me. You guys doin' it or not?\" They had chosen to follow through on her plan, but… \"Seriously,\" Drippy's tone said she wanted to roll her eyes to match the one she was doing with her head. \"How long is she planning to do this?\" The other girls cast glances around at each other as they looked at the box Charlotte held. They had all been excited with anticipation, even the ones with misgivings about the method, to see how this would play out. But for two weeks not a thing had been done except more gifts appearing on Poppy's bed every third or fourth afternoon whilst they were away in class. Ash had told them it would take a while, but the longer it went on the antsier some of the more nervous ones became. \"We need to give the stuff time to work into her cells.\" Ash explained when they called her on the first weekend after no other part of the plan manifested. \"When the situation comes out, her parents will definitely order a slew of tests to determine if she has been taking it for long or if it was just a onetime thing or even slipped to her unknowingly. \"Different tests can determine the last time of use and how frequent. She hasn't been using long enough to show a chronic habit, but this might be enough to convince the mice in white coats of light experimentation at least.\" \"I don't get it.\" Drippy scrunched her nose in that way she did when she was trying to puzzle something out that was going well over her head. Ash sighed. \"Fat absorbs and stores pretty much anything you put into your body, if it was just an isolated event the body would flush the residue out almost immediately, not leaving enough to form a positive result for the tests. We have to give it time to absorb into her body fat and hair.\" \"Hair?!\" \"Uh huh.\" Ash affirmed as she picked at a callous on her palm. \"The most conclusive test is considered to be the hair test, since it's something that doesn't get processed out like blood or other fluids after a few days or weeks.\" \"Well then why don't we just stick some of those chemicals in her hair product or something, then?\" Ash looked kindly at Charlotte who was also sounding just a smidge desperate. \"Because part of what they test for is metabolites, the stuff that shows it's gone through the body and not just stuck on there from being in proximity. \"Luckily, I have a bypass for that, but it will take another week. So until then, keep her happy.\" \"Well hurry up. I'm not that good of an actress.\" This time Ash reached over and fondly patted her cousin's head. \"Patience Puppy, thy long suffering will be rewarded satisfaction-fold. You're all already doing such wonderful jobs of looking irritable and cranky, just how Fuggly should think you are.\" Well, the crank and grouch were not falsified, and there was much rejoicing when another delivery arrived on behalf of their plotter of deviousness the day right after a regular parcel drop. \"What are they?\" Josie voiced everyone's thoughts as they peered inside the bag that contained, not flowers or elegantly wrapped parcels like the previous ones, but a small plastic container of tiny, black objects and another, padded, containing a vial of dark yellowish-brown substance, about the size of a fingernail. \"Ear comms,\" Poppy answered, looking up from the page that had been included with the containers, instructions no doubt. \"She says for each of us to take one and keep them in at all times from now on. Just be sure to remember to take them out before showering or swimming.\" The cohorts present looked again at each other and shrugged. Best to comply and see what happened for the time being. It seemed Ash may not mind explaining in detail, but had a habit of playing her cards close. Once they thought they managed to sort out which end went in first and frantically searched twice for the tiny buds the size of watch batteries that got dropped in the process, they stood around looking at each other at a loss of what came next. \"Now what?\" Kate asked, the rest also looking to Poppy as if she might have a clue. Poppy shrugged. \"There's nothing else on the paper.\" Drippy jumped and let out a near squeal, bringing the others' attention her way. \"It's Ash,\" she exclaimed, hand over her mouth in a dramatic whisper. \"She saying we need to turn the… 'Faust-loving buggers on'.\" Eyebrows went up at the off-topic swearing. \"She says to push the buttons at the back.\" This restarted another round of frustrated clawing, but eventually everyone was online. \"Evenin' one and all.\" Ash's chipper tones sounded in their bugged ears almost as clearly as if she were standing there herself. Muttered greetings were returned. \"Now that we're all here…\" \"Wait!\" Drippy cut in, pointing to the three remaining buds. \"Charlotte, Jane, and Elena haven't gotten their comms yet.\" Irritated noise drifted over the line. \"Well then someone get it to them. And while you're at it, pass on the vial too. I suggest you hup to. I've got eyes on Harriet in the stables, perfect time for us lot to talk.\" Josie was immediately dispatched with the items while Kate voiced a question that had been sitting off for her for some time now. \"How do you know Harriet is in the stable?\" \"Age of the geek, baby.\" Ash smiled and leaned back in the padded wooden chair the hotel offered, the smile turning to mild pout. She missed her own office chair back home, with its tipping and swiveling and rolling… \"You bugged the place?\" \"Duh!\" She wondered if the owners would object to her buying an office chair for using while here. \"You didn't honestly think I'd be stuck up a tree in camo with binoculars, did you.\" But she was considering looking for a better place. This countryside hospitality was wonderful, but the Wi-Fi sucked and she was almost certain the maid was snooping through her stuff to check her story about being a writer looking for inspiration for her college entry application. Closer to the city would improve on those, but that also meant a longer drive. Might be worth it if she could find a place with an actual desk. \"You're watching us.\" People , she rolled her eyes. It's not like that should be shocking considering you know what you're government is doing. \"Just the halls and general areas. \"No bedrooms or bathrooms.\" Might was well be nice and reassuring. It makes for easier people dealing, but she wished they would be faster at processing these things. Gods she missed being in East Asia, where she had friends that actually used their upper circuitry beyond base functions and didn't all but live at work. Definitely staying there until her deadline to give her parents an answer about her future career. \"What's this about bathrooms?\" The new voice broke in as she saw the icon come to life on her screen, showing one of the remaining earpieces had been activated, along with its two companions. \"I got bored and put mini cams in the boys' school bathrooms. Hey, who wants to guess which jock is not in a pinch worrying about girlfriends sneaking in?\" Sever distressed noises and angry words crossed while the instigator contained her sniggers to maniacal grinning, until Poppy popped the party. \"Ignore her, she's been watching her weird Japanese cartoons again. The cameras are here in Abbey Mount to keep tabs on Harriet.\" \"They are called anime, imagination is a good thing, and 'weird' depends entirely on your point of view- not to mention have nothing to do with the subject at hand. And I am currently watching and feeling sorry for the poor thing stuck carting you-know-who's snorky arse around the riding field.\" Just to get back for that she was going to dig up the weirdest, guaranteed to give any one of them a mental Vesuvius if they saw it show. Not that they would probably ever know unless she sent it to them, but it was the little paybacks that were the funnest. \" Anyhooo , you shall be happy to know we are ready to poke things along. I thought the comms would make it easier than running for your phones every time we need to talk. If you don't like voices in your head, just shut it off. But I rather recommend keeping them on but learning to tune each other out unless you hear yourself called.\" \"Why would you need to call us suddenly?\" Jane asked. Ash smiled. \"I was rather hoping you would ask that. But before we start, none of you would happen to be able to recommend a good hotel around here that actually has decent Wi-Fi?\" Appropriate topic to get us back on track, no? I thought it appropriate to actually explain a bit more about Ash's plan. ","Summary":" OK this is not my story originally, it's miles89's but she wasn't going to finsh it and said I coul"},{"Movie":"Wild Child","Title":"The Real Wild Part About It All","Author":"drpepperluvgurl","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5614236","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hey guys! I have also made this story, based exactly on the characters from Wild Child. All the names will be the same. I have decided to start the story off from where most people saw them in the credits. This story will be written from multiple points of view. Hopefully i will do my best not to confuse you too much. Anyway, enjoy! Poppy So here i am. Sitting on a blowup chair on top of the cold pool water, sitting next to my 4 best friends in the whole world, and my boyfriend. Ever since i went to Abbey Mount, i truly think i have changed into a better person. Maybe it's just me, but i actually think that i am completely like my mother. Surrounded by my friends, having a boyfriend who cares about me, and being a leader on the lacrosse team at my school. \"So what do we next 'ere in L.A. Poppy? I can't think of anything else! Nails, hair, shopping, swimming, and you even took us to some fashion show.\" Kate said quite matter-of-factly. \"Well, Trouble, i am enjoying every moment we spend together so you just keep leading us to whatever might come ahead.\" My amazing boyfriend Freddie commented. I was absolutely thrilled when i was told that he could come see me for the summer. Well, most of the summer anyway. Then right before we had to go back for school, he was supposed to go back to England and be there for a while. I was dreading that moment ever since the second i heard it was going to happen. I tried to look over my head so my eyes could meet him, but the sun seemed to blind me to a point where my mind just figured it was worth it. Of course my body thought otherwise. In my lame reactions my entire body flipped over. One thing led to another, and there i am. In my own pool holding my breath and praying that i left my phone outside of the pool and instead of on my lap. I heard laughing from above the water as my body slowly started to ascend upwards. Gravity pulling me up, as some would say. \"Ha-ha, Poppy trying to cool off?\" Drippy seemed to be the one who was the funniest of all of us. Yet, she seemed out of it most of the time. Maybe that was where her humor came from. \"Now why'd you do 'hat?\" Julie questioned. She was laughing too, and i assumed her question was more of a question that wasn't looking for an answer. Freddie looked at me with sparkling eyes. Well it looked that way. Maybe they just appeared to be looking that way because my vision was semi-blurred from the chlorine in the water. Then i saw a cheeky smile pull up on the corners of his face. I didn't need 20/20 vision to see that beauty staring me straight in the face. I swear i was in love. Just looking at that boy, i knew i'd fallin'. And fallen way hard. \"Come here,\" i heard him whisper. I was the only one that it was directed to. I actually was also the only one who heard it. Kate and Drippy were busy looking through a magazine i had given them a while back, and Josie & Kiki were laughing about some song that they were listening to. No doubt it was a 'Weird Al' song i showed them. Apparently they had never heard of him before! Ha! He's only just the funniest man to ever make parodies of other peoples genius music. I slowly made my way towards the edge of the pool and put my arms up on the edge pulling my body upwards a tad bit. Freddie leaned in and placed a soft kiss on my lips. I let the taste linger there for a moment before i licked my lips. He laughed at my gesture then gave me an explanation as to why he had kissed me. I didn't feel like i needed one though. I love when he kisses me. It not only makes my heart race, but it makes me smile. Smile like when i used to just have mother-daughter dates with my mom. \"I think you deserved that after flipping over into the water after you wanted to look at me. But i must say, you do look quite enthralling all wet.\" He hinted that i looked more attractive while wet? Hmm, i see that the boy is growing into a man. PERV. Haha i love him so damn much it hurts. ..... \"Sooooooooooooooooo, what will it be? Chocolate, or Vanilla.\" Of course it would be US, standing here in the longest dairy queen line i have ever seen in my life. Maybe the line was only there because Drippy was taking FOREVER to figure out which kind she wanted. Drippy loves Chocolate, but ever since i made her try some Vanilla ice cream, she has become addicted to it. She can't even walk into my house without checking to see if we have any Vanilla ice cream left. \"She'll take a Chocolate thanks. I'll have a chocolate milkshake too thanks.\" I tried to order fast so the people behind us wouldn't get mad. It was only me and Drippy out to ice cream today. Kate, Kiki, Josie, and Freddie were out exploring sites. Drippy wasn't feeling well so i decided to take her out for some ice cream. I wish Freddie was here though. It's really like there is a whole in my heart when he is gone. Like how it was since my mom left. But then i met the best girls in the world, made them my friends, and fell in love. That whole seemed to almost dissapear. But when they are gone, and my mum is gone... well, it seems that whole just gets bigger and brodder. Well, the first one is just basic, and it will be setting up things for the future. So I guess you can call it a 'fill in' but I assure you, the chapters get much longer as time goes on :) thanks for reading! review for any questions or concerns...or ideas? :D ~Emily~ /drpepperluvgurl :D:D[Chapter 2] FREDDIE The Next Day.... \"Goodmorning sunshine,\" i said to her as i watched her climb out of her bed. God how i wanted to be in that bed with her too. Well, i was for a small amount of the time. That was until i realized that if i woke up in bed next to her then the girls might get some ideas. And that is definately not what i am to be needing. At least not after what people have been saying since i was seen with Ellie. Now THAT would be a story to tell.... \"Hey..\" she said weakly. She always looks so fragile in the morning. But there always seemed to be a sparkle in her eye. At least whenever i looked. \"What time is it?\" \"It's only 9. I missed you yesterday, and we didn't get back until late. You seemed really tired so i let you sleep.\" I missed her so much it hurt. How in hell can i ever go a day without that girl again? She seemed to fill up the insides of me. Every empty space. And then when she left me again, she seemed to take away fragments of me. It was as if my life consisted and revolved around her. She was my Juliet as i was her Romeo. I do love her, but my love may be unrequited. She never has told me that she loves me too. Maybe she never heard me tell her that i loved her. Or maybe she just didn't have the same pull of force that thrust my own love upon her every moment i saw her. Or thought of her. Especially when i touched her. \"Oh. Want to go get some breakfast? Drippy said she was feeling a bit better, and i think we can go out to IHOP or something if you want,\" she said this as though she was questioning herself. What need her to question? Why does she feel that i would oblige? I love you! I felt like screaming. You make my world spin. You are the air i breathe. I can't last without you. You are honestly all i think about-- My thoughts seemed to stop mid-sentence as a very unfamiliar brunette barged into the room. \"Poppy!\" She yelled, with what looked like the fakest enthusiasm i have ever seen. Pity. \"What are you doing here Rubz. I told you that i have company, and that i didn't really have time to see you.\" My baby girl looked a tad bit angry. Okay, so angry wasn't the best word for it. Maybe furious might fit the title better. \"Well i wanted to see you gosh. So let's go shopping. I saw the ca-utest jimmy chuu's today, and i was like 'oh-m-gee' i need those! And then i thought that maybe we could go get some then find a couple matching dresses. Roddy might come too. Sorry you two didn't work out by the way.\" She didn't seem the slightest bit sorry. Who was this Roddy? And what did he have going on with my Poppy that didn't 'work out' ? \"That's great. Well i think that you should go ask Roddy to take you, and then maybe i'll talk to you when i am ready to. kay? Can you leave now i really have to be somewhere.\" Poppy stood up and started ushering out her friend with the long brown hair. When she re-entered the room she looked as though she was going to scream. \"Are you alright?\" i stood up to meet her and placed my left hand on her right forearm. My right arm dangled on her left hip bone. She is beautiful... i thought. \"I'm fine. So IHOP?\" She was hiding something. I wanted to know what it was, but i decided to let it go for now. Besides, i was hiding something too. Yet my something was totally irrelavant, completely mental, and i was forced into it. What the hell was i supposed to do about it anyway! \"Yeah let's go,\" i said as i placed my arm around her shoulder and put of a kiss on her forehead. I love you Poppy, i said in my head. Oh how much i wished i could say that outloud. I wonder what she thought of me as when she placed one of her arms around my waist. Was i just some English boy she decided to bring home for the break? Would this all be over with after she had decided she was done messing around with me? If you could call it messing around. All i know about her though, is that i have never felt this way before. She makes me so happy, and all i want to do is be with her all the time. I know, not a rational request at all, but i still want it. What about when she goes to college? Where will she go? Shall i follow her? Or would she have moved on? We arrived at IHOP and had gotten a big table. Poppy had called Kate and apparently they were going to come here and we would all eat together. I was glad that the girls came though because it would give me some time to think without having Poppy worrying about if something is wrong with me. Poppy is a sweet girl, but she gets caught up in what she's doing so i believed that she wouldn't be looking to me every 5 seconds like she normally would if we were together. Through the muffled sounds of their words, i sat there and thought. How am i supposed to tell Poppy about that night with Ellie? I wasn't drunk, no. I wasn't high either. And i am a man so i should have been able to stop it from happening! Not that much happened anyway... I tried to relive that situation one more time... \"Ah come on Fredster, you owe me remember?\" what the hell is she talking about i don't owe this girl shit. \"Ellie, be reasonable. All you did was help me out with a girl. You only gave me some advice, and now you want me to mess around with you? I thought you got over me. I really did.\" And honest to god i believed that she did. All those late nights she would scream at me telling me about how much of an awful person i was. \"Oh PLEASE Freddie. You know she doesn't love you. She used you of course. And now that she sees no need for you, you can just get out of her life.\" Even though i knew it was a lie, deep down it burned me. It really hurt. And there was nothing that i could say or do to make it feel better. She never did say she loved me... \"You're wrong,\" was all i had come to muster up in such short notice. \"No, i'm right and you know i'm right. Just believe me. You have known me longer. You loved me, and i love you. The feelings happened and were all there. Those feelings we had were mutual and Real.\" She was right.... \"Believe me. I know what i'm doing,\" then everything happened so quickly. Next thing i know she dragged me onto her bed and starting kissing me. My hormones seemed to be upset that i was in love with Poppy Moore, and there was a girl thrusting herself at me right now who i wouldn't comply back to. I love Poppy, I Love Poppy, I LOVE POPPY. I tried repeating those words but they didn't help. Did i really love Poppy? OF COURSE I DO! Damn just because some girl is throwing herself upon me i am questioning my love for Poppy? She is my trouble.. While i was having this mental fight with myself i finally got out of my head and back to reality for a split second to notice that she had taken my pants off, and hers too. I tried to remove her arms from my neck in a soft way, but she took it all wrong. She took my force as passion and kissed deeply. Her tongue plunged through my lips and into my mouth. Never had i seen her so aggressive in my life. She never did this when we were together... \"Poppy could never make you happy the way i can,\" she said through her teeth as she continued to explore my mouth. I wonder what it feels like. Sticking your tongue in someone elses mouth and having them be immobile the entire time. What must that feel like? Pretty boring i'd say. Unless it was me inside Poppy's mouth. And her lavendar hair smell lingering onto me which makes me want her even more. Her cherry flavored lips, with the hint of strawberry on the inside. I'd never tasted her tongue before, and she hasn't tasted mine. But i did get to linger on the feel of it for a moment when she first opened her lips to me a month ago. It was spectacular, and all i wanted was to do that and taste it for real. Now that my mind was thinking so intensely of Poppy, my lips started moving. Ellie took this as if i was giving in and kissing back. To hell i was! I was trying to get the bludger to bloody hell off me! Before i could completely remove her body from mine, her hands moved towards something of mine i did not feel like giving up. She was giving me a handjob. I know i love Poppy, but wow. That night ended up being her finally stopping, and me praying to God that she wouldn't try to go any further than she had. I got her to go to sleep, and right after i left. I felt like shit after that night. And it was even worse since i let her take advantage of me. When she touched my package that was ESPECIALLY where i needed to draw the line. But, i liked it in some weird messed up way. Except i knew it was all with the wrong girl. Would Poppy ever try to do something like that with me? To hell... I'd never know...[Chapter 3] Poppy I was watching Freddie make faces every few seconds, but it didn't even make sense. He has been silent the whole time here except for when he ordered something. And the waitress flirted with him. I felt like kicking the living daylights out of her. He's MINE ! I felt like screaming. But, maybe he wasn't mine. I never really understood how girls would fall in love and turn themselves over to boys, just like that. I mean, what if the boy didn't feel the same, or didn't really love her like she thought. What if he was just playing her? How would the girl know? She wouldn't. So women have to trust men to not break their heart. Mine was already so broken, i think that there's really no hope for me in trusting anyone anymore. Except, i love Freddie. And i am holding myself back because i know that i am not ready to trust. I can't be. Seeing as i am still a virgin... But i don't want to give myself away until i know it's true, and to the right person. I wanted it to be Freddie, but i just don't know if that's right or not. I don't know how he feels. Well, other than the time i heard him whisper, \"i love you Trouble,\" when we were sitting on a bench holding hands and watching his school's lacrosse team practice. I don't think he even knew that i heard him. Because he hasn't said it again. \"Hey you okay?\" i rubbed him forearm hoping it might break him from his trance. Then he did something that shocked me. He wore this disgusted look on his face as he pulled his arm back suddenly. I was so taken aback i thought i was going to cry right there. Oh look who's here. \"Poppy, doll i missed you! I'm glad you're back. Wanna go out tonight?\" Roddy said as he approached my table. Did he really think that i didn't know what happened between him and Ruby? Really? I'm not an idiot! But he kind of still was my friend. And Freddie looked pissed at me, or mad that i touched him, so i guess i can hang out with my friend, right? \"Um hey Roddy, do you think that i could call you later? I'm kind of busy tonight,\" i wasn't busy but i didn't want the girls to hear my plans i would make with him. Not now. \"Yeah sure. Cya around.\" And then he left. I felt a weight being lifted off my shoulders. I turned to Freddie, and now he looked ever madder. I ignored him. Fine, if you want to despise me, then i will shun you! We ended up not talking for the rest of breakfast. \"Poppy, Kate and I are going to go see a broadway show!\" Drippy exclaimed. \"Josie and Kiki said they were going to the beach, so well, do you wanna come too?\" I didn't wanna ruin their fun. And i knew i would because i don't like broadway at all. \"Nah, you guys go ahead. Besides i have some things i need to take care of anyway.\" \"Alright see you tonight then. And we might go to the beach later too. So we'll call you when the show is over.\" Kate said. Then her and Drippy grabbed their things and left. Great. I'm home alone with the idiot who hates me. Why the hell is Molly at camp! I so need a mani-pedi.... I got up and decided i was going to do that. I ran to my room to get my purse, and i saw Freddie looking at a picture of Roddy and me. \"Why did he come see you today?\" He asked in probably the scariest tone i have ever heard his voice in. \"I'm going out. I'll be back later.\" I responded in a soft tone, and went over to kiss his cheek as i picked up my purse. He moved away. \"Answer me.\" Why is he so damn mad? \"Freddie he's just my ex. And he was my friend. He wanted to hang out. Are you okay? You seem different.\" \"I'm perfectly well. Where are you going now then? To go be with Roddy?\" he was mad at me. But i have no idea why. And it hurt... \"Just going to get my nails done...\" i said in a small voice. I felt so little right now. And it was all his fault. I felt like i was nothing. Just the scum left at the bottom of a trash can that nobody wanted. Why was he doing this to me? \"If you are going to seem him there is no need to freaking lie to me!\" he yelled. \"I'm not lying! And i am not going to see him! What the hell has gotten into you!? Every since breakfast you seem to be giving me the cold shoulder. Like what the hell? What did i do?\" I screamed back. I'm done shying away and backing down. My wall has just been built up again. Screw boys. Screw them! \"Nothing has gotten into me except some sense Poppy!\" That's it i've had enough. \"Well when you decide that you like me again, i'll be at the mall. GOOD BYE FREDDIE.\" i stomped out of my room and slammed the door of the house on my way out. Who does he think he is? Calling me out like that? I didn't even do anything. Maybe i am wrong. Maybe i don't love him, and maybe that was God's way of showing me that. Fine, i don't want to give myself away to him. I don't even want to ever kiss him again for that matter. Screw Freddie Kingsley. But secretly, the voice in my head only wanted myself to be wrong. I was lying when i said i didn't love him. And if anyone would be screwing Freddie Kingsley, i sure hoped it would be me...[Chapter 4] Freddie What have i done? As i watched Poppy, MY Poppy, run out of her house crying, i felt my heart breaking. She looked devastated. And that was all my fault. I don't even know why i am acting this way! Maybe it's guilt, and a bit of jealousy. But, i had no right to treat her that way. I should have run after her. I would have, if i didn't hear the words slip out of her petite body. \"I hate you Freddie!\" she screamed from her car. I need to get away from here. Now. Meanwhile.... Poppy I hate him. I hate him. I HATE HIM. Why did he have to go stomp all over my heart? Right when i was ready to actually be normal again. I hope he doesn't come back. I hope that, THAT will be the last time i see Freddie Kingsley. What in the bloody hell am i saying... I'm in love with him... I need him. I want him. I wish he could be with me all day long and i would never have to worry about a thing. Please come back... Damn that stupid small voice in my head.... *** \"I'm home!\" I yelled as i entered my house. Kate and Drippy shouldn't be back, they called me earlier to tell me that they were at the beach. It was getting dark, but they said they would take a stroll on the boardwalk before heading back. Kiki got asked out by a guy she met at the beach, so she is on a date. But Josie should be home by now. God knows where Freddie is... \"'Ay Poppy! Missed you all day. Want to 'o do somethin?\" Josie appeared out of nowhere startling me with her question. \"Oh sorry. Didn't mean to scare ya!\" I laughed, but it was forced. I hugged her and we decided that we would sit down and talk. \"Freddie's not home, in case you were wondering.\" She said. Well, that's good. Maybe he's somewhere cooling off.... \"Cool. Want to watch a movie? Do you know who Nicholas Sparks' is?\" \"No, should i?\" This will be fun. Ahh, Romance movies. This should calm me down. Or at least let out a good cry. Which i haven't actually done since the night i thought all my real friends hated me.... \"Well....\" Freddie \"Hi i'm Freddie.\" Wow this chick looks just like Poppy. Beautiful brown hair, gorgeous brown puppy dog eyes, even fruity hair! \"Nice to meet you. I'm Silvia.\" I had decided that i was going to go to the boardwalk. I ended up wandering to a KOHR brother's ice cream place. They have really good soft served ice cream. Poppy took me here once, it was amazing. Now, here i am talking to the lady who sold me the ice cream. She looked my age. Maybe a bit younger. \"I'm not from around here. Are you?\" Okay, that probably wasn't the best way to start small talk, but hey, i'm a guy. We aren't necesarily the best when it comes to this stuff. \"Yeah i could tell. I love your accent by the way. It's very charming. I'm actually from Wilmington North Carolina. So i'm an East Coast girl. Just out here for summer. It's quite nice really. My father is an actor, so i come out here a bunch. What about you? What's your story Freddie.\" She seemed nice. And down to earth too. So unlike the side of Poppy i saw at the beginning. but i later learned that it was just an act. She was hurting, so she was mean. \"I'm from England. I live with my Mom who is like a principal of this well-known private school. I don't go there, but i go to a school like it. I'm here on break with one of my,\" i paused. I didn't want to say girlfriend right? That would sound like i'm an ass just trying to hook up with a girl. Maybe that's what i AM trying to do... No. Even i'm not that shallow. \"--my good friends. She's from around here so it works out nice. Of course i don't know anybody so i seem to get lost a lot.\" Alright, i didn't need to say that. Ha! Was i setting her up so she would offer to show me back to where i came from. My 'friends' house? That might be nice. Poppy won't like that... \"I get off my shift in 20 minutes. I can probably help you get to wherever you are going, if you want.\" She blushed at the last part. She was nervous i'd say no? Is that it? Hmm... \"Thank you, that would be great.\" And just like that, i made a new friend. Lovely how amazingly charming i am. It's a talent, really. *** \"Hey i had a great time tonight Freddie. And i'm sorry to hear that you and Poppy had problems and didn't work out.\" Okay, so i told her about Poppy. I was completely honest, up until the part where i told Silvia that we broke up. Hopefully that doesn't cause too many issues later on. \"Me too, thank you for taking me back home.\" \"You didn't tell me you were staying with a very weathly person,\" she said and laughed. It was a cute, healthy laugh. And i liked it. Shit, i liked it. I liked it so much i couldn't help but smile at her. She continued talking. \"Would you like to hang out tomorrow or something? I could show you around some more. Or we could go exploring to places even i don't know!\" she asked with much enthusiam. I might like that. Actually, i know i would like that. But what about Poppy. Yeah. What about Poppy Moore. The girl i am in love with. \"That would be great. Can i have your number so we can meet up somewhere?\" She smiled at me and blushed. I really hope she doesn't fall for me... \"Here ya go. Well, i should be heading back home before my dad gets worried. See you around Freddie Kingsley.\" She said as she walked off into the dark. I felt a tad bit bad standing in front of Poppy's house and watching her walk into the dark. All alone. There really are some awful people out there. Should i walk her home? I might not make it back though. And i really don't want to have to call Kate, or Poppy, or any of them asking for a ride back. I walked into the house, and that's when everything seemed to change. I saw this boy trying to seduce Poppy. He was almost hovering over her. But she was crying. Maybe he wasn't seducing her, maybe he was just trying to make her stop crying? Josie appeared out of nowhere with a look of hatred on her face. What the bloody hell did i do? \"Way to go Freddie,\" she said as Kate, Drippy, and Kiki went over to stand by her. Poppy was still crying, but i could barely hear her. I wanted to run over and comfort her like i normally would. But right now, i don't think i was welcome to do so. I walked to the room i was staying in and shut the door quietly. This is going to be a long night....[Chapter 5] Poppy I heard his door slam. It just about shattered the only living part still inside me. He was with another girl while i was here, alone and hoping he would come back and tell me that loves me. That he wants me, and he's sorry that he got mad at me. But instead i have a guy who used me, and hooked up with my ex-best friend, trying to stop me from crying. Drippy, Kate, and Kiki didn't get back til just a little while ago. Josie let Roddy into the house, and of course he came to my room first. I never actually felt uncomfortable having him in my room, but it's not like i ever let him near the bed. But he saw me just laying there crying my eyes out, so he came over to me and comforted me. I ended up saying that i was thirsty. ( I wasn't i just wanted to remove him from my bed, while i was on it.) Now Freddie was back, and the only thing he did was glance at my puffy red face, then walk away. He really doesn't care about me. Maybe he's just going to leave then... \"Babe, i have to be somewhere really early in the morning, but i won't leave if you aren't okay. Are you?\" I knew he was going to leave no matter what, but he was trying to win me back. Not that there was any way in hell that he would. \"I'm fine just go. Bye Roddy.\" And he left. The moment i heard the dorm slam the girls came over and wrapped me up in their arms. Only Josie knew what was wrong, but i didn't really feel up to telling the rest of them. \"Kate, I'm tired. I'll tell you guys what happened in the morning. Maybe some sleep might do me some good?\" I sniffled. I don't think I'm getting any sleep tonight. Or tomorrow. Or the next night, or the next.... Freddie Kingsley broke my fragile heart all over again. \"You're right Poppy. Sleep might 'elp you some. Come on let's up her up girls.\" Kiki said as she motioned for them to help her, get me off my fat ass. I did feel fat, even though all i had today was some pancakes from IHOP this morning. **** \"Freddie..\" i kept repeating that name over and over into the air. I know i shouldn't be up thinking about him, let alone whispering his name silently hoping that he would hear me and apologize. I am so broken, and all i want is someone to fix me. All i want is my mom. I need my mom.... No P.O.V. Freddie finally decided that it was his turn to tell her some things. He slowly got out of his bed. He wasn't even close to getting sleep tonight. Not after the way he saw Poppy, and the way he did absolutely nothing to go and help her. He slowly walked across the hall and into Poppy's room. After he turned and shut the door, he noticed that Poppy was sleeping. But she looked in pain. Her face was scrunched up, and her entire body seemed to be shaking. Instinctively, Freddie half ran half jumped over to Poppy and placed his soft hand on her shaking face. She gasped. He barely noticed that his hand was cold. \"Shh..\" he told her. He started to stroke her cheek hoping that she wouldn't be mad at him, or that she would be too asleep to notice what he was doing. Being on her bed, he was strangely even more attracted to her. Well, it wasn't strange in his mind. He is always attracted to her. Even when she is dressed in the baggiest sweatpants he has ever seen, while wearing his too-big-for-her t-shirt. She loved wearing his clothes. The sight of her in his boxers from back when he was with her in England slowly filled his mind. He suddenly had the chills himself. \"Freddie...\" she mumbled softly. She could have swore that he was with her right now. She wanted to opens her eyes to see him, but if he wasn't there, she would probably break down crying again from the dissapointment. \"Yes Trouble?\" he said. I love you, and I am sorry i was a total moron. She slowly opened her eyes deciding to give in and see if he was really there. To her surprise, he was. \"What are you doing here?\" she whispered at his raspily. To him, it seemed like she was mad. But to her, she was too shocked to calm the shakiness in her voice. \"I-I was just checking to make sure you were okay. I'll be going now,\" he figured that if she didn't seem happy to see him, that she'd rather be sleeping instead of seeing him. Boy was he wrong. \"Can you stay?\" She replied. There was a shine to her voice, and it sounded like she crying again. This sound coming from the girl he loves more than life itself, made him want to cry too. \"Of course,\" he said. \"I'll be here as long as you need me,\" and hopefully longer, he thought. \"Why were you mad at me today? Why did you push me away at breakfast this morning?\" Her desire to know why the one she loves was shunning her was too strong for words. She needed to know why he was treating her that way. And why he seemed like a different person entirely. He knew that he couldn't put this off forever. He told her exactly what happened with Ellie that night. He tried to watch her expressions as he spoke, but she didn't seem to have one. It was just blank. That didn't sound good, seeing as the girl he was staring at wearing the blank expression was Poppy Moore. All she could do was listen. She was mad. She was hurt even more. And then she was mad again as to why he didn't tell her sooner. And also as to why he would just randomly get pissy at her for no reason. She just kept staring blankly into space. \"Poppy?\" he whispered to her as he touched her forearm. She flinched at the touch of his cold skin. \"Y-Yes?\" She choked out. She didn't have anything to say. She wanted to cry again. She was slowly getting the feeling on the inside that Freddie wasn't the one for her. That he just wasn't right for her. \"Are you--\" She cut him off before he could continue with his stupid question. \"Do you love me?\" She asked. It was straight forward, and right to the point. If he hesitated, then he needs to leave. If not, well, then she might have to think over the whole situation again. He responded almost immediately. \"Yes. I love you.\" He said with confidence in his voice. He leaned down and placed a kiss on the small smile that was appearing on Poppy's face. She didn't kiss back, but he didn't care. He just wanted to taste her lips again. It had been too long for him. And he went for almost a whole day without seeing her. It truly was torture for him. But it wasn't much different for Poppy either. Except that if someone was good enough, they could distract her. \"Thank you,\" She simply replied after he pulled away. \"I'm really sorry i treated you that way. I didn't mean to at all. My thoughts and memories made me angry. I just wish it never happened. Honestly, i think the only reason it got that far was because i was thinking about you the whole time. And what it might feel like if i was with you.\" Shit, that's NOT what you tell a girl! he mentally slapped himself. All she did was blush. But then she thought of something. They were on her bed right now. Is he still thinking about that right now? Does he want to do something? She sure wasn't going to do anything right now though, and she knew it. She was still pretty mad at him. And for the way he was today when he spent the day with some girl. She seemed nice and all, but Poppy didn't like people moving in on the ones she cared about most. Just like when her father was getting re-married, that tramp never got respect from Poppy, nor Molly. And Poppy doubted that she would ever. \"Will you stay with me tonight? I don't feel too well,\" she said. Images flashed through his head as he thought through exactly what she was asking for. He knew that it wasn't going to happen tonight, but this was definately a start. \"Of course Trouble. I love you.\" He said one last time before he crawled over her and under her blankets. She snuggled up to him as he wrapped an arm around her waist. He kissed her forehead softly and started to hum something to her. \"Mmm-You Think I Don't Care But I Do... yeah I Do... But I'm Too Scared... To Tell You How I Really Feel...\" he kept mumbling. Poppy Moore was breathing into his chest, and let out the faintest resemblence to the words, \"I love you too Freddie..\" and slowly drifted off into unconsciousness as the hum of his voice echoed through her body.[Chapter 6] Freddie After i laid in bed with Poppy for a few moments, i truly had the most amazing rush of emotions hit me. The dagger than was plunged into my heart since i saw Poppy in tears, seemed to be removed and replaced by the soft kiss of Poppy. She kissed my chest, probably assumed i was sleeping and didn't notice, but i did. Her lips stroked across my broad frame, and even lingered towards my neck. I so wanted to kiss her back, but i didn't want to ruin the moment for her. If she was enjoying this, and if it was making her feel better, then in all means will i let her continue. I must say, she has the feet of a 40 year old man. Very, very cold. But they were soft, and she had wrapped them around my legs. Her entire body was entangled into my own. I had no objection, but i wonder if she knew that kind of hold she had on me every moment she would seduce me like this. Her lips made me crave her more. And the touch of her skin sent chills up through my body. I really hope she didn't feel me shake when she kissed my neck so tenderly just a moment ago. She has also been whispering things, but if i appeared to be awake by responding, she might be embaressed. And i certainly did not want that. I made this girl feel like shit. I hurt her. I truly, truly hurt her. All i want to do is take it back. But i can't, and it might even be too late to make it up. When i told her i loved her moments ago, i saw the smile pull up from her lips. But there was something hidden beneath the smile. Was it - fear? Or it might have been sympathy too. She was scared, and sympathaizing for me? I must have really gotten myself in deep shit then. As the sun shone through her glass doors, i felt her body shake beneath me. I wanted to finally respond to the actions she has been making all night, but i still don't know if it would be a good idea to stop her. She might have wanted to do something.... \"Freddie?\" Okay, that thought was crushed. \"Yes Trouble?\" Ah, how i love that name, \"Thanks for staying with me last night. I-I-I don't really know what i would have done... Things are so tough... And i..\" She still sounded sad as her voice trailed off into a faint whisper. \"Poppy, is there any way that i can make it up to you today? For how much of a horidious cow i was to you yesterday? I feel awful, and i really would like the opportunity to make it up to you.\" I held my breath waiting for her response. I don't think my fragile heart can take a rejection from her. Or even another sad smile she sends my way, oh so frequently now. **** We sat in her bedroom for another hour just talking about what happened between us. We remembered all those days in England, and the amazing time on my birthday where she snuck into my campus and my dorm room. She slept with me that night (not that way guys ;) ), and i swear i could have held that girl forever. \"I missed you,\" she said as her head curled into my shoulder. \"I love you,\" i said. She probably didn't have anything to say back. But i am okay with that. Maybe i should have given her time to reply? I beant over and kissed her. This time, her lips were mobile, and i felt them moving perfectly insync with mine. It made me smile how perfect it was kissing her. I probably looked like an proper moron smiling while kissing this beautiful girl. But i honestly could not help it. Her petite body held so closely to mine already had an effect on me as our lips moved in perfect syncronization. I pulled her body even closer to mine by the waist. Sure, we were kissing quite passionately while our bodies are entangled on her bed. Neither of us seemed to have a problem with that. Maybe it was the pure love that i was feeling running it's course through my veins. I slowly opened my mouth a bit wider, hoping, haha, that her tongue would find it's way in there. To my surprise, it did. Her tongue was tangy, and it send shock waves up my spine the moment her tongue hit my own. She pressed it against mine while she wrapped her arms around my neck and pulled my face closer to hers. I then felt the need to have her body even closer to me, so i put my hand back on her hips and brought her into me once again. Her tongue had the same taste as her lips did, except now that i have actually experienced the full on wonder of it, i don't think i can get enough. I can't get enough of you baby, that old 80's song rummaging through my head. Funny, how when i am entangled with the girl i love, in an intense liplock that i am thinking about a song from almost 2 decades ago. I am quite strange. Poppy sure don't think so. ;) I couldn't help but smirk. POPPY I am so in love with him. It scares me so much. And damn i think i need to see my therapist. I smiled as I pulled away from Freddie. My arms still wrapped around him. \"I missed you,\" i said again. But my voice sounded more steady this time. He smiled at me sensing the confidence in me slowly creeping back in. \"Would you like to go out with me today Trouble?\" he said with a cheeky smile spreading rapidly across his face. He was nervous about asking me out on a date? He's so cute. \"I would love to go out with you. Where shall we go?\" I really hope it's not somewhere that i would run into anybody that i know. I just want an alone day with Freddie. It seemed so much simpler back in England. In some ways, I was hoping that i could just go back to school now so we could be together there. But i knew that it would not be nearly the same. Not only would i just get to see him about 4 times a month, (if i am lucky) but i also only get to kiss him in certain places. Okay, so i am sorta a fan of PDA, but only when it is me. And i want to show off that Freddie is mine. And i would like to kiss him whenever, and wherever i want to. If only we lived in a simpler world....[Chapter 7] Poppy Out of all the places on earth, he took me to one of my favorites. Universal Studios. The first time i went, it was in Florida with my mom. I think i memorized the entire park that day, and my mom seemed to do the same. We spent the whole day there, and then we spent the night walking along City Walk just talking about whatever came to mind. She was my best friend, and that day in the hospital 4 years back, God took my best friend away from me. In one of the most painful ways possible. Death. \"So what do you want to do first? Rides. Or food.\" I just wanted to get on a roller coaster and let the wind capture my hair in one swooping motion. But i was also pretty hungry, since i only had breakfast yesterday. \"How about we try something at the food court first, you didn't eat much yesterday,\" Of course he noticed that. Well, actually he wasn't there to notice. He assumed that she was messed up in so many ways when he left her like that. The thought made me mad that he would just think that like he was the cockiest person ever. That was another quality I didn't think that he had. We walked over to the food court, and hit up Mel's Diner. It was really good, and i felt the greases soft but strong taste on my tongue. It was delightful. I didn't really feel like eating anymore though, so i grabbed my fries and stood up. \"Let's go on Jurassic Park, it's my favorite.\" That ride practically made me pee my pants the first time i went on it. I loved it soooo much, and it was just the right amount of scary. In Florida, the ride consisted of a water ride. It had many nooks and crannies, and the way the boat glided through the water was weird. We traveled through sewer water, and when we approached the dark warehouse ahead, i knew it would get interesting. I grabbed my mom's hand when we entered that dark place. Images of slowly falling down a waterfall just before we almost got sucked up by a big t-rex fulled my mind. My hand slipped away from my mom's and lifted into the air as i screamed my lungs out. Right now, i felt the loneliness of her hand slipping from mine all over again. The whole was coming. \"Sure thing Trouble. Some how i knew that you would want to ride that,\" he smiled at me and took my hand in his. Nevermind, the whole was filled now. \"Sucks that it's so crowded on all these rides,\" he said. \"Well it's always crowded here, but trust me. It's worth it.\" Of course this place was packed like usual. The tons of diverse people coming from all over the place. Florida was more kids younger with their families, hence me and my mom back then. But here in Hollywood, there were a lot more people. Many different ethnicities, and more of a wider age range. That's why most of the rides here are more scary and breathtaking than in Florida. \"Woah they look freaked out,\" Freddie was looking at a young couple and the girl was shaking. I laughed, because practically knew this ride by heart. In a few moments, she would be exclaiming about how freaking awesome that ride was - no doubt. \"Trust me, they had fun.\" We approached the front of the line and started to take our seats. I chose 2 second row, and in the middle. Alright so i was daring to go so close to the front, but i am still too wimpy to pick a side of the car. My heart beat slowed down as the nerves were taking over me. I knew what would happen. We would start off slowly, then as we went on we would be attacked by huge dinosaurs. I was ready, and i swore i knew whenever one was going to come. Yet, i still screamed every time i saw one. Freddie looked amused, and he half laughed half yelped whenever one of the things came out at us. But he took my hand in his the moment the car we, and the 14 other people on the ride with us, almost got smashed by an old beat up car falling down from a ledge. It was scary as hell! But holding Freddie's hand made me feel better. I screamed, and then laughed as another thing came up and splashed us badly. I was already soaking wet. At that moment, i was glad that i left my phone back in the car. \"You good Trouble?\" Ha! When was i ever better?! This was my kind of thing. These rides made my life, and always made me happy. \"I'm lovin' it,\" I croaked at him. Then BAM, we fell of the ledge. My hand slipped from his as i lifted my arms into the air and screamed my lungs out. The feeling of loneliness came creeping back, once again. But luckily Freddie sensed it, and the moment that the hurricane of water plunged at us, his hand found it's way back to mine. We laughed at the sight of eachother soaking wet and semi-shaking. This day keeps getting better...[Chapter 8] Freddie led me towards the entrance of the water rides area. So I AM one for getting wet, but some of these had a 90• degree angle drop. I mean it's not that I was afraid, I'm just not good when it comes to a drop that big and then a massive dive into the water right after. When I was 5, i almost drowned. I actually was scared out of my mind the moment my body plunged beneath the murky water at my house last summer. \"You ready?\" Freddie asked. We were about to go on this big log ride, and the normal amount of people per log was 4, so there was 2 other guys on it with us. I recognized one of them as my dads work buddies son, but I didn't know the other one. I nodded as we stepped toward the loading dock where we were supposed to be getting onto the log. Freddie stepped behind me in a way that was motioning for me to take the front of the log. I really didn't want that, especially not for this. \"Do you think that I could sit behind you? And you sit in the front?\" Please please please say yes. \"Sure Trouble,\" he climbed into the front and I immediately felt a bit calmer. Jamie, the guy who I knew, sat behind me after I climbed in behind Freddie. We silently greeted eachother as the last guy got onto the ride with us. Almost a minute later we started being pulled up towards the sky. So unlike the Jurassic Park ride, we would not be at ground level for most of the ride. This, we would be up in the air held up but the strongest of polls and columns. I felt a bit safer about the drop with my arms securely around Freddie's waist. He left his left hand on my thigh just to show that he acknowledged what I was doing. Or maybe it was just that he wanted to have some part of him on me too. Jamie and his friend looked excited and completely ready for the big fall. \"Well this doesn't seem that bad really,\" I finally said. Jamie looked at me with a semi-smirk on his face. Then he spoke in a questioning tone, but I could hear the care in his voice. \"Poppy have you ever been on this before? It's honestly JUST the beginning..\" and his voice trailed of mid-sentence when the log suddenly jerked down stream and we all got splashed. Since I was the smallest in between these big guys, I didn't get quite as wet as them. But still I could feel the cold water creepy down the legs of my jeans. Damn that boy was right. The log was now thrashing through the stream we seemed to be devouring. Please don't kill me, please don't kill me i kept repeating to myself in my head. Freddie must have sensed my tension seeing as his hand that was on my thigh moved onto one of my hands that was around his waist. I felt his moist kiss touch my skin, which sent shivers down my spine. Well, it was either that or the water that was currently inhabiting my pants. **** \"THAT WAS THE BEST RIDE I HAVE EVER BEEN ON!!!!!\" When i screamed this, i swear that made heads turn from people all the way on the other side of the park. But hey, a girl can't help when she is as excited as i am. After we went on that log ride, we quickly jumped onto this roller coaster that was called the dueling dragons. I swear! I could ride that baby all day! And it was even funner too because after that super scary water ride my clothes went dry from the nice breeze, or wind that shoke my clothing dry. \"Haha i never knew you were this wild Poppy!\" Jamie and his friend, whose name was Daniel, had come with us on the ride too. He was yelling his ass off, just like i was. \"Hell ya! Jamie, you must not know me at all.\" Well he actually didn't really know me. I only knew things about him when we would occasionally be at work with our fathers' and we'd chat about our lives. He was my age after all, so he seemed to relate for the most part. I started liking him more than Roddy actually. But ah, well it doesn't matter anymore. Freddie I had just won Poppy back, and now she was with her friend Jamie or whatever his name was. They knew eachother from somewhere apparently, and ever since the water ride she has been hanging all over him. But she can have friends, right? I shouldn't be so annoyed about this, yet i am. More than you possibly could imagine quite frankly. Poppy grabbed onto my arm are and started leading me towards another ride. I was starting to get tired though, so it was more like she was dragging me along the way. After all, we probably have gone on every single ride on this goddamned park twice, except the ones that Poppy got scared, which was only like 2. We already had ice cream, so there really wasn't anything else we could do except keep riding rides, or leave. Poppy wanted to ride more apparently... And so did Jamie. \"Hey you okay? This is so much fun!\" She bellowed at me. You could see the glee in her eye as she spoke those words to me. Ah, this is definately the girl i fell in love with. \"I'm good. Now, Moore, Poppy Moore, i do believe that we should be heading back soon. The girls might get worried.\" To hell about the girls, but that seemed the only way she would leave. \"Oh my gosh i completely forgot! And we left our phones back in the car. We should go soon...\" Her voice trailed off with a hint of dissapointment. Alright, maybe i shouldn't have asked her to leave. But if i offered up that i was tired and wanted a break, no doubt would she just run off with Jamie and Daniel. She turned to her friends and told them something before coming over to me and pulling me towards the gate to the park. \"That was fun, thank you for taking me here.\" \"Your welcome, and i'd love to do this again sometime.\" We continued to walk out of the park and to the car. The closer we got to the car, the darker the sky seemed to get. And by the time we were about to pull out of the space, the sky looked like the color of Poppy's nails the day i found her alone on her bed crying her eyes out over me. Black. Hey guys sorry i didn't post it sooner. Well, i'm also sorry that the last one was kind of short. Normally i go over 1,000 words per chapter. Anyway, i should have another one up by tomorrow morning. Sorry again. I just had some soccer training, and then my friend came over asking for help. It's weird you know. All these people ask me for help on love and other adolence things, but i don't have a boyfriend anymore. But still, i've learned enough about boys over the years. Did i mention that i have a brother..? He's 4 years older than me actually. AND, he's 6'5. Amazing, yes? And my best friend, who is also a guy, is ALSO 4 years older than me. But that's okay. Right? :) Em Review Please. I would love some help on the ideas.[Chapter 9] Poppy It's been exactly 2 weeks since Freddie and I went to Universal Studios Hollywood. Ever since then, our relationship seems to be getting a bit edgy. Like for one, this girl keeps hanging out with him behind my back, and the only response he has for me to that is, \"She's a friend,\" I mean, what kind of Bullshit is that? Eh? The girls are having a blast though, and i guess that that is really what matters. Hopefully they come back here with me. I honestly don't feel like coming here without them. Especially is Molly isn't here. I hate all these people who act like people they're not. Hiding, or just posing. It annoys me a lot really. I know, i'm not always looked at as smart, but i'm not an idiot. And i know what the hell i am talking about when it comes to this stuff. Those people pretending to be something they're not, really have no way in controlling what goes on in their life. It's not like they can just magically change and say that they want to be this or that. Ever since they put up that reputation, well most people just don't leave it in the dark. I was ready to though, as far off as that sounded. I am ready for a change. And i know that i'm ready for my life to start once I'm out of high school. Abbey Mount is great, but is right. If you want to work at the top, you must work your way up. And most people don't just get there without loads of hard work. Strangely, ME. Yes, me, Poppy Moore, was ready to work. \"I am ready for the challenge,\" i mumbled softly to nobody. \"Didn't know that you go this mental when Freddie ain't 'round Poppy,\" Josie said. Apparently she heard me. \"Ah 'lright. You gu-irls ready for some shopping?\" Kiki approached. I remember that day when we took the trolley into town to get outfits for the party. We looked so good in those old vintage clothes. I think I smiled more that day then i have in my life. Well, ever since my mom... \"Kate, is ripped tights in- or out?\" Drippy was always one for bizarre, yet colorful outfits. Tights were always her thing, and i did notice that lately a lot of hers have been ripped. Sometimes i thought of her as a chick from the 70's. With that big blonde hair of hers that always looked like an afro unless probably padded down with heavy equipment. And her clothing was always so hippy looking. She didn't always act like a hippy. More like a brat. Shit did i just say that? Or - think that? \"Always in,\" Kate said, but i would have to disagree. These girls had an odd fashion sense. The one who seemed to have the closest to mine was probably Kiki. Josie did occasionally, except she was more curvy that me. \"Well let's get to it guys!\" We grabbed our stuff and headed for the door, just as Freddie was arriving back with his little friend. He was smiling like an idiot, and i was only a miniscule away from slapping the hell out of him. Why does he do things like this to me? He says he loves me, but he just goes and flirts with all these other girls! Either this has to stop - this meaning his socializing with girls frequently and leaving me in the dark - or we need to seriously rethink our relationship. God forbid he breaks up with me for one of them. \"Hi Freddie,\" Kate seemed just as annoyed as i was. Good. \"Hello.\" Is that all he could damn say!? This boy has got nerve. Haha, got nerve. The stupid Hannah Montana song just popped in my head. At least she has a boyfriend who cares for her enough not to go be with other girls.... \"'At were you doing?\" Of course there was Josie always there to drill the questions. Drippy was too fixated on her wagon wheel to even realize that their was tension in our encounter. \"Mmm\" Well there ya go, here was Drippy contributing to the conversation. I swear that's the best thing i have heard in weeks. I started laughing. Freddie turned to me with someone unreadable on his face. I didn't know if he was mad, sad, annoyed, or all three. I looked away and hoped that someone else would say something and he would stop staring me down. \"I was hanging out with a friend, Why? What were you doing?\" The arrogance in his voice was very noticeable, and i don't know if it was intended or not but there was a huff at the end of his annoyed question. And a smirk. What an ass. \"Well Poppy got asked out, and since you are being a horidious cow, we decided that she should go. We'll be off now, goodbye Freddie.\" Wait, i?-I what? Oh well i guess this was a way to get him back. But he might be really mad. HOLD ON. I am worried about him being what - mad at me? When i am furious at him! What is wrong with me. Must be my hormones giving me these lapses in rational thought. Freddie turned him head towards me. I didn't meet his gaze on purpose. I knew that if there was even a hint of sadness of pain in him, then i would give in. I'm so weak. \"Hope that goes well,\" he said. His voice was even, which suprised me. Then he continued. \"I'll be gone by the time you ladies get back, Possibly see you around back when school starts.\" That was it. All he said. Was he realy just leaving? Was he honestly that mad at me for something i didn't even know i did! He needs to rethink the decision he is about to make. The moment he steps on that plane and leaves me, there is no way in hell that i am going to go back to him. He can't ever win me over again. There's not a single thing that he can do to make me want him again. Especially not after the way he's been treating me lately. Freddie walked into the house and out of my sight. That wasn't the only thing he seemed to be walking out of... Hey guys. I'd like to dedicate this to one of my close friends, Tannen. It's her birthday today, so this one's for her. Also, thank you sooooo much to all of those people who reviewed. You truly make me smile :) I'll keep trying to update as fast as i can. but know, when the break is up, they will be coming MUCH much slower. I literally will have a compacted schedule to the maximum. Any how, hope you liked it! Expect more maybe tonight. Today, i get to go see Sherlock Holmes again! It was awesome the first time. I love Robert Downey Jr, and Jude Gay soooo much! And of Course, i adore Rachel McAdams... The Notebook, only one of the best romantic movies ever made. I still cry everytime i see it, you know. It's weird how most of Nicholas Sparks' books are sad and make you cry. Like, every single one i have read i have cried in. Someone always dies... Notebook - Noah & Aly die. The Last Song - Ronnie's dad dies. Dear John - John's father dies. Nights in Rodanthe - the dude dies... AHHH. :) Anywayyyy, lots of love. Em P.S. The next chapter will be mostly from Freddie's P.O.V. Oh and sorry to leave a littttttle cliffy there. Guess you'll have to endure the wait :)[Chapter 10] Freddie I walked in that door and felt my stomach churn with every step. I love her, but she doesn't seem to be the same anymore. Or is it me who's changing? Maybe we are only good together when the other needs something... That idea seemed to be getting better and better as i stepped into the guest room Poppy had laid out for me just a few weeks back. I have only been in L.A. for about 2 and a half weeks, but i am starting to consider it another home. I fit in pretty well, except the accent, and most people seem to like me. \"But he doesn't want me anymore! I can't make him stay if he doesn't even like me!\" Alright i regret hearing her say that. But Kate's comment afterward did not help my side of the story in any way! I do want Poppy, i always want Poppy. Could that be the problem? To hell! That is not a problem! \" Poppy it's his loss if he leaves. He will be walking away from you, and that means you deserve better,\" Oh yeah, great help Josie. Okay, so i wasn't planning on leaving tonight. But what really is the harm in leaving for England a week before i was going to? They might understand the excuse i miss my mum, or i want to see my brother. Something might work other than, I don't like Poppy, i need to leave. Honestly, I probably should not have lied. Well was it lying, i could not understand. It only seemed like bending the truth! Just a tad... ***** I woke to the mass numbers of screaming coming from across the hall. Poppy. My instincts took over me then. I was raised a gentleman, and I must always help a girl when she is in pain. Even if I seem to be the one who is causing it this time... \"Trouble, are you alright?\" Damnit i used the name. Make a mental note, NOT to use that name! She wasn't even awake was she? When i touched her forehead, her entire body which was tense, seemed to loosen all in one motion. \"Freddie don't,\" She breathed out my name. Okay, so it was clearly me that was causing all the problems. \"Mmm,\" She then resulted into grabbing onto my arm and holding it to her chest. My heart lept, and i felt the tingles running up and down my spine. How is it that every time we interact so closely, my body just goes right in shock? Maybe it wasn't shock. It could be the immense amount of love that I have for her, just maximizing with every touch we share. Me being the big wimp I was, caved. I climbed into bed with her and let her push herself against me. After a few moments of tusle she had completely cuddled up against me. It was probably the cutest I have ever seen Poppy. Her mouth twitched up into a smile. I felt my own lips curl into one. This is going to be a long night. Poppy Was this real? Is he really in my bed and holding me right now? I thought he would be gone and hating me right now... Yet i still don't know what I even did... Mmm, his cologne was strong and it burned my insides til i felt them soften. I heard his faint snoring which was an immediate alert that he was still sleeping soundly. His expression showed how he was more than content on holding me all night. Mine did the same. I could lay like this forever.... *** \"Poppy? Come on wake up,\" The sound of his voice cackled through my dream. The memories of us dancing at last year's spring fling slowly faded my memory, as did the song by Nelly Furtado that was creeping into my mind. \"Mmmm, sleep.\" Was truly all i could muster up to him. I didn't really have much to say except to beg for forgiveness and hope he'd take me back. Except, I still had no clue why he was upset with me. I have behaved, right? I haven't changed into the worse either... Maybe he was getting bored with me. Or, possibly he was annoyed that I wasn't so on the Wild Side anymore. Hopefully that's not it, seeing as everyone likes me a lot more now that I seem to be calmer. But, the other people shouldn't make me determine how I act. It is first and foremost my own decision on how I will behave. Right? \"Trouble, I won't be waiting all day.\" The edge in his voice scared the crap out of me. He was really going to leave me! All alone! Like this? Does he even know how much of a mess I am right now? Seeing as my mothers rememberence of her death day will be occuring soon. Less than a week, I think... \"Are you leaving me?\" PDF as Mr. Nelis would say. Well, I think my question was... \"You know I have to go back to England before school starts up again. See my mum, and my brother. And my grandparents!\" He sounded like he wanted to damn leave. Well FINE. If he wants to leave, so be it. I'll just have to see him when I return to Abbey Mount. Then he'll see what he has done to me in the decision to abandon me like this. And how I have changed once again in his absence. Maybe not in his own favor this time I will act. \"I know, but I just thought...\" Hell, I don't even know what I thought. All I really thought was that I needed to keep my sentences coherent to show that I was confident. At this point, it might be the only reassurance i will be getting. \"I should probably get back to packing now, but you know that i'll still see you next term.\" That's too long. I want to see you right here, right now. He was leaving a week earlier than planned which just added more confusion to the matter. What about his prescious little friend he had acquired this summer? Was he just going to leave without a goodbye? No, surely he must go bid her a due. What the hell is wrong with me? I am talking like poet from the 18th century! I am losing it! Of course Freddie, my boyfriend, or possibly we are on a break now? - has decided to leave just in the moment as I am still in puberty and trying to figure myself out. Possibly we need the space? For now, I think I'll play along... Just for now, though.[Chapter 11] Poppy Okay so i was right. After he got up and left me there so he could pack, I watched as the same girl who he had been with lately come up to my front door and ring the doorbell. I wish I could just leave her standing there. But I need to be the bigger person in this whole situation, yes? And the first step to showing Freddie how grown up, also how much he needs me in his life, is showing that I can handle anything that is thrown my way. Including this girl who stole my boyfriend from me during the time we were supposed to have together as our vacation. Great. \" Hi! I'm Silvia. You must be Poppy, I've heard so much about you. Really, it's a pleasure to meet you.\" Okay, that was shocking. He talks about me? Surely guys don't do that when they are involved with other people.... Not talk about their ex - or the one they are cheating on. \"Yes, that's me. Nice to meet you too Silvia,\" I'm not really sure what I am supposed to say. I mean, she knows about me. Does he say good things? Or was she being sarcastic when she said it was a pleasure to meet me. Like what the hell-- \"Oh hey Silvia. I see you've met Poppy here.\" Lovely timing Freddie. Sometimes, his timing is like Harriets' was when I would be almost caught doing something against the rules. Almost. WOAH. He did not just push me out of the way to go hug her! Like this is my house!? What kind of idiot does that? When I already know he is completely involved with her. This day couldn't get any better, really. \"I'll meet you outside, okay?\" All he said. Damn I want to slap him. Oh look, it's Kate. Just the muscle I need to take him down. Of course I couldn't do it alone... But now I have backup... \"Morning everyone.\" KATE. Can you not sense the tension in the room!? \"HELLO.\" Alright maybe my reply was a little too loud and obvious. And the strain in my voice, plus the look of pain on my face didn't seem like much help either. She watched me straighten myself up while from the corner of my eye I saw Silvia also straighten up. She definately looked like an athlete. Very toned and defined leg muscles. She was wearing some Roxy board shorts and navy blue converse. I liked it, but I never really could wear that when I was around my old friends. And ever since England came around, I have been taken shopping to stores that they go to and end up buying clothes they like. Normally its all very comfortable... \"Hi, who are you?\" Kate looked at Silvia with curiousity burning in her eyes. No, maybe it was hatred. Can't really tell anymore really... \"I'm Silvia. Nice to meet you. You're from England too? I love the accent, it's beautiful.\" Oh I see. You just have to suck up. And steal my friends too! Who do you think you are? And in my own house? No. I am not getting played in my house. \"Kate,\" Alright maybe the fire in my eyes was getting her a tad worried cause her eyes softened once they met mine. \"Can we uhh - talk?\" \"Sure,\" As we were walking towards the pool I heard Kate call back to Silvia, but I don't really know what she said. \"Now tell me what is wrong.\" PDF. Pretty Damn Straight-Forward. Maybe that's why I love Kate. And sometimes, why she annoys the hell out of me. \"That's the girl he has been with, and now that he is leaving home early, he's going to spend his last day with her. He doesn't like me anymore... He knows I love him. Why would he do that to me? He must hate me...\" I felt my voice get smaller and smaller until it finally died at the end. Kate noticed the change and embraced me with strong arms. \"Poppy,\" She kept her arms around my shoulders and looked at me. \"If he wants to do that, then he clearly is not the one for you. You deserve much betta. He is being an idiot. Not all relationships last, and I know that you know that.\" She was right. But I thought he was the one... I thought we were perfect, and that we always made eachother feel good. Guess I was wrong. Or just too damn caught up in the moment to realize anything. Shit. \"You're right. Hey, do you think we could go to your house for the rest of the break? I know I love it here and we decided to come here for break, but I kind of want to get away from it now. If you and the girls are okay with that?\" I felt Kate's strong embrace again. \"Yes, that would be lovely.\" She whispered. *** \"So 'our telling me that he is gone?\" Kiki looked dumfounded. \"Yeah he left this morning. But that's okay, we are just good friends...\" What a lie. Really, lying is bad for the heart I should stop it. \"Well I am fine with going back to England early. I haven't had a real wagon wheel in forever!\" Drippy of course butted in. Not that I minded since she agreed with going to Kate's for the rest of break which was in reality, only another 2 weeks. \"If 'hats what you want 'here Poppy,\" Ah Josie. She was always there to make me feel better. Well not always but just when Fre-- \"Then we will all go with you. To England! Come on, let's get packing.\" She continued cutting me off mid-thought. Thank God. \"I'm going to miss it here...\" Kate said. \"Me too,\" I mumbled. I doubt anyone heard me seeing as they all were standing up from the edge of the pool and heading towards the door. I guess that's a good thing. Poppy \"Mmm. Sleep.\" Ugh. Can't you see I am sleeping? Why try and wake me? \"Come on Poppy. The plane landed and you need to get up now. Almost everyone if off the plane!\" Kate's panicked voice enchoed through me. \"Shit, let's go!\" I semi-jumped semi-wabled off my seat. She laughed as my tired eyes were opening and closing randomly as we exited the plane. Then it hit me. We are in England. We are in England? Wow. This was my brilliant plan for forgetting Freddie. This place, the one where we met and I fell in love with him? Aren't I such a genius? \"Hey can you step out of your mind for a moment and help me with these bags? What the hell did you bring?\" Kate talking again. Well maybe it's good that she is stopping me from thinking. Last thing I need is to think too much and then-- \"HELLO?!\" Shit I was doing it again! \"Yeah sorry, just tired.\" I grabbed some of my bags and piled them on top of eachother before rolling them towards the drop-off area where Kate's brother was going to be. As we talked towards the door I heard Josie, Kiki, and Drippy all laughing their heads off behind us. How were they behind us when we exited the plane last? Bathroom I guess. Ugh . If they would just shutup maybe my headache would go the heck away! Woah. Kate never told me her brother looked like.... Hey! Sorry I am ending it there, but nothing is ever fun unless there is some element of surprise, right? Hmm. Well anyway my break is over and i have school tomorrow. Damnit life sucks like that I guess. Anyway, I should be posting one tomorrow. And then expect another one by Wednesday. Thanks for your patience guys you are the best! Oh & reviews/ideas/comments would be lovely. (: Thank You. Em[Chapter 12] Poppy I never did know what it felt like to have a big brother. Freddie was the closest thing I had ever had to that before, except we were a little closer than that. But meeting Kate's brother I didn't expect that he would look so, perfect. His porceline skin hugging his baggy dress shirt while his dark wash jeans hanged a little more fitted down his long legs, ending at his feet with addidas soccer shoes. And he had probably the most beautiful brown eyes I have ever seen - plus they even had a touch of green in them. The color danced around the edges of his pupils, which made them shine brightly when the sun shone down on them. Wow. \"Hey Andrew I missed you!\" Kate engulfed her brother who was waiting with open arms. The dress shirt he was wearing stuck tightly to his skin and his bicep muscles were very visable when his arms went around Kate's - suddenly small looking - figure. \"You were supposed to come visit us! You were only hours away, and mum said you wouldn't be coming back to England til we did. But here you are! What happened?\" \"Now Kate, let's not be rude. Drippy, hello good to see you again. But i don't seem to know the rest of the girls here Kate. Introduce me, and we'll talk later.\" His eyes wandered to me, and i felt my stomach tighten. What did he think of me? Was it bad that I kept my hair it's natural color? Should i dye it blonde again? Was I more attractive that way? Oh no what if!- \"This is Josie, Kiki, and Poppy.\" Kate pointed at me last. Lovely, the last name is always the one that is lingered on for the longest. Maybe this will be really awkward. Just as I was thinking about running, Josie stepped forward and shook Andrew's hand. Kiki followed after her. Does that mean it's my turn? I'm not sure. Kate seemed to think so. Andrew just laughed. Lovely, he's already laughing at me. I must look horridious, and completely barbarick. I did sleep for most of the plane ride. \"Nice to meet you too Poppy,\" he stepped towards me. I gasped. Probably the wrong move. His eyes lingered across my facial features, and I felt a hand on my back. I didn't move an inch though, I was too focused on this incredible figure in front me. I wanted to reach out and touch him. And this, was only when I met him. Imagine what will happen once my mind sees him everyday for another 3 weeks. Maybe getting over Freddie won't be so hard after all. Huh. *** \"So good to see you girls! Haven't come back since before last semester! Too long, really. And now there's Poppy here to join us. Darling I have heard so much about you, really. Honered to have you here, and thank you for letting the girls come to your house for the long break.\" Kate's mom must like to talk - or maybe it's just the sound of her own voice that appeals to her - but I swear, she hasn't stopped talking since Andrew took us back to the car at the airport. And here we are in Kate's living room just sitting down and glancing over the renevations she supposedly had done to her house while we were at school. It looked much bigger than Kate had suggested, and Andrew seemed to be taking it all in too. He lives here though, so it didn't make much sense. Then again, I'm not really good with guys in the first place so hey - who am i to tell. After about another 20 minutes of Kate's mom talking on and on and o - well you get it - I finally grabbed my stuff and took Kate's room. We would be sharing, but I really don't mind. I still get my own bed, and at least there was a bathroom in the room too so it wouldn't be shared with other people. Well one person in particular I mean - Andrew. Another good thing about Kate's room, was that Andrew's was right across the hall. And he left his door open a lot. Plus he plays guitar - pretty well from my understanding too - while he sings. He loves Coldplay, and the Beatles. I even heard some Aerosmith: Dont want to close my eyes I dont want to fall asleep Cause Id miss you baby And I dont want to miss a thing Cause even when I dream of you The sweetest dream will never do Id still miss you baby And I dont want to miss a thing Lying close to you feeling your heart beating And Im wondering what youre dreaming Wondering if its me youre seeing Then I kiss your eyes ..... This is literally one of my favorite songs of all time. It was one of my moms favorites, and hearing Andrew sing it while he played the guitar chords made me almost cry right there. He plays this one a lot, and for that I am truly greatful. I wish I would have the courage to go in there and be next to him while he plays, but he probably thinks I'm lame. I guess there's always a chance he doesn't right? \"Hey Kate,\" Okay, so how should I propose this question? \"Am i aloud to go and listen to him play?\" SHIT! That is not the right way to propose this! What if she thinks I'm-- \"Yeah sure go ahead,\" That was simple. I got up one night and stood outside his door for literally 2 minutes listening to him just do the chord progressions and hum some of the melody to the chorus. It was gorgeous. Surely he would think it was dumb for me to want him to play for me, right? I mean it's just a song... This is stupid, I should go back to Kate's room - no Josie's - cause it will look like i chickened out! And Kate will know I'm such a lame person. Yet, before I could decide there he was. Standing in front of me with his guitar wrapped over his shoulder. \"Hello Poppy what ya doin here?\" There was that American accent creeping through. Why is that, isn't he from here? And as far as I know he has never even been to American! It was Kate's first time when I took her after we got out of school for break. \"I- uh, well um,\" Should I leave? Ya I should go. Before I make an idiot of myself. Maybe he'll just tell me that he's busy and wants to be alone. Yeah of course he does! \"Um I'll uh... Go.\" \"Hey wait.\" His hand went on my shoulder. It was so warm and comforting. He was actually touching me, and I wasn't freaking out! Yes! That's an accomplishment. Oh. Nevermind, my cheeks got hotter as they reddened furiously. Hopefully he didn't notice that it was all because he was simply touching me. \"I was wondering if I could come watch you play that. You know, I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing, Aerosmith.\" His eyes widened, and then his lips curled up into a smile as I awaited his reply. He's smiling, that must be a good sign - yes? \"I would love that.\" He would? - LOVE that. Ha! He would love it! He placed his arm around my shoulder as he led me into his room. Even though I could see him playing on his bed from Kate's room or the hallway, I had never actually seen anything else. Like the walls were covered in soccer posters, and pictures of him. He wore a lot of things from Stanford actually. It was surprising, seeing him in the Cardinal attire. I even saw him in uniforms for them. So clearly he has been to America. I sat on his bed as he slightly closed the door and made his way towards the bed. I looked away from his wall and turned towards him. He still had that smug smile all over his face, and in some ways I wanted to slap it away. In other ways, it looked adorable. I guess the adorable part kept me content long enough to resist attacking him. \"I'm sorry I really shouldn't just barge in - i mean you were playing - so it was rude of me and I'm--\" I haven't been cut off by a boy in a long time. But at least he was gentle about it instead of most guys who would just yell over me. \"-I love that you are here. And you didn't intrude, I invited you in. So tell me, do you like Aerosmith? Or is it just the song you like.\" He was so kind about everything. And so so nice to me! It doesn't make any sense. First impression of me was given off as shy, stupid, and reserved. Why would he waste his time with me? \"I love Aerosmith. And especially that song, so I really enjoyed listening to you play it.\" Another thing I like about him. He doesn't hover. After Andrew strummed the first chords to the song I felt my eyes closing and his sweet tune carry through the room. He started from the beginning of the song, but my mind always had to sing at the part where I would sing the harmony with my mom. I felt my lips open as I sang along the harmony while Andrew sang the original tunes. Our voices meshed well, and it truly sounded like a ballad. Then I kiss your eyes And thank God were together I just want to stay with you in this moment forever Forever and ever Dont want to close my eyes I dont want to fall asleep Cause Id miss you baby And I dont want to miss a thing Cause even when I dream of you The sweetest dream will never do Id still miss you baby And I dont want to miss a thing I dont want to miss one smile I dont want to miss one kiss I just want to be with you Right here with you, just like this I just want to hold you close Feel your heart so close to mine And just stay here in this moment For all the rest of time Dont want to close my eyes I dont want to fall asleep Cause Id miss you baby And I dont want to miss a thing Cause even when I dream of you The sweetest dream will never do Id still miss you baby And I dont want to miss a thing Dont want to close my eyes I dont want to fall asleep I dont want to miss a thing. ..... \"Mmm, beautiful.\" I felt alive again. It's like Andrew was a brother of mine already. We seemed so comfortable together already and it's only been 3 days since I have gotten here. And now we sing together - one song, which is a love song - and I am suddenly feeling love towards him. Maybe it's just the song infecting me? Who knows. \"Thank you. You were beautiful too. Hey Poppy, can i take you somewhere tomorrow? I really want to.\" I felt my breaths slow at this. I tried to smile even though my heart had practically stopped from his eyes direct contact with mine. I smiled brightly then as he took my hand, \"I would love that.\" Hey! TELL ME if you liked it. Thanks. :) Suggestions? Que?! Expect the nexxt one by Wednesday. Remember, i got intense workouts tomorrow for soccer. Even though it's FREEZING outside, I'm still out n about getting it done. Lots of love. (: Thanks for reading. Review please. Em[Chapter 13] Poppy I looked at myself in the mirror, triple checking that I looked okay. According to Andrew wherever we were going was someplace fancy and I had better dress up if I didn't want to feel misplaced. My diamond earrings shone, but not nearly as much as my eyes seemed to with the new thin line of eyeliner under them. I was wearing my favorite shirt of all time that my mom had gotten me. It was a Manchester United jersey, and even though nobody really knew how much I loved them, I still wore the jersey all the time. It matched perfectly with the skinny black jeans that I had hugging my body. I felt arms wrap around me at once and smiled at how comfortable it made myself feel. \"Is this okay, or too casual?\" \"You look perfect,\" he whispered, sending chills up through my spine. \"You don't look too bad yourself,\" I grinned and then quickly turned away as I felt the blush furrow onto my face. \"So you have a uniform? A fan I suppose. That's good, seeing as I am too.\" He smiled a cheeky one as he lowered his body frame just a little so it looked less tense. Was he nervous around me? Cause I sure felt like a 13 year old out on my first date with my crush. Who knew, right? The thought made me smile, and he returned my unexpected smile with a ear-to-ear beauty. I think I am going to like him. \"Yeah my mom got me into it. What about you? How did you become a fan? Wait, we are going to the game!? Thank you Thank you THANK YOU!\" Oh wow I am stupid. He lives here of course he loves them! Screw it! I finally get to go to a game! \"Ha-ha of course we are! Well I play soccer back in the US on my college team, but whenever I come visit back home I go watch a game,\" The only thing that stuck to me out of his words were college and US . He goes to college there, and I will be going to college there... And he's athletic. I like a strong boy, and I have always loved soccer. Perfect in every way, and he seems like a nice guy. Really charming too. Apparently while I was so caught up in my thoughts we had already entered the stadium and were in line for some drinks. \"Yes I'll have a please,\" ( A/N:HA! Couldn't resist :) Anyway, back to them two) Ooh Yum. Caffeine. He has good taste. I smiled at him and ordered one for myself too. After we got the drinks he said that he wanted to go onto the field. The school he plays for back in America has connections to the English Premier league, and they come visit - or occasionally train - with them. I followed after Andrew and he walked through the big tunnel. I used to have dreams about this tunnel, when I was little. While I was dazzled with every step I took, he looked like he had done this many times before. As he approached the some guy who looked like the trainer on the sideline, they started talking. I was still wandering in from the tunnel just taking in all my surroundings. It has been a ages since I have been to a pro, or college, soccer game. Last time was with my dad. Which was right after my mom died, and the Cardinals had made the championship. They ended up winning that game, and I still stand by my conclusion that my mother was the one who made it happen. \"Poppy! Come here!\" Ah, yes Andrew. Wonder what he wants.... \"Come on, play with me!\" Alright this wasn't what I expected. My eyes were seeing a tall muscular male figure motioning me to come with him on the field, while he was carrying a soccer ball. Then his lips seemed to be yelling in my direction. This attracted attention from the few fans in the stands who were at the game early. \"--Kate said you played lacrosse, and before that you did soccer for about 4 years! Show me your skills, Poppy.\" His smile was so alluring.... \"--Ah come here! You just gonna stand there?\" Out of the little bits and fragments of the conversation my brain was picking up, I was apparently supposed to be out on the field with him. I put down my purse and took off my shoes as a I ran out onto the field towards him. His radiant smile only grew as I came closer to him. \"So,\" he dropped the ball on the ground in front of me and continued. \"I think you should take some shots on me, seeing as I am back-up goalie. And i heard you played a lot of center mid and striker back in the day,\" How many questions did he really ask Kate?! I swear she has a file for me and he just studies it. He continued telling me about myself, as he was trying to teach me - or rather get me to remember how to kick the ball. Once I finally remembered though, I sent a rocket right towards his lower body. Then, everything happened so fast. The lights in the arena started to get brighter and brighter, and then they just vanished. I felt a big body mass on top of me but I just couldn't come around to open my eyes. \"Andrew?\" I tried to sound serious, but it more or less came out as a soft whisper. His booming laughter fillled my body and I felt the big weight move onto of me. Must have a leg cramp of whatever because I felt the majority of the weight shift over to the one side. Ow. \"Yes? You do know you just so happened to come inches from my package,\" Well! I didn't know English boys talk about their bodies that way! And especially while one is on top-- \"But it's okay, I forgive you. And now I bet you are wondering why I am on top of you,\" He cut me off, and now that I was thinking about it, I couldn't feel my whole lower body. \"I'll be getting off now, but I just kind of was running to tackle you, then I tripped and fell on top of you, sorry.\" I immediately felt a huge amount of pressure lifted off of me. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled. I had my eyes closed during that entire encounter, so when I slowly opened them it hurt. The lights literally were blinding. How on earth to the players play soccer while these lights are in their face? Must be pretty damn good... \"Sorry, can you not stand up? We should probably go sit by the bench now cause warmup is going to be starting pretty soon,\" he motioned his hand down towards me. I took it gratifully. My body shook under me, because apparently it wasn't too happy about moving right now. \"Haha are your legs numb?\" No shit sherlock. \"Yeah thanks Andrew!\" I tried to sound angry, but it only came out as playful. What is wrong with me? \"Here lemme help you,\" He scooped me up in one motion as he carried me toward the sideline. \"Aren't I tad bit heavy for you?\" All he did was laugh. I have a feeling this will be an interesting date. I mean, this will be an interesting time I will be having with my friend. ;) I couldn't help but smirk at my mental correction. \"Well excuse me for watching out for your poor man arms. I don't want to get you injured before the season starts up again.\" \"How thoughtful,\" There it was again! His completely ravishing eyes staring down my lame brown ones. Magnificient.... WHOOPS! I wasn't supposed to post today! Ahhh, but i kind of was at school and got in total trouble for kicking this dude in my class in the crotch (FYI he was totally harassing me!) so i was sent to this thing and they were stupid and left me with a laptop for a couple hours. Here I am, writing this for you. Lovely isn't it? Well, I'll be off to soccer soon then. Maybe i'll post tomorrow. If not, then probably thursday. Lots of love home skillets. Em[Chapter 14] Poppy \"Hahahahahaha! Seriously! She did not do that, I don't believe that she did that!\" I haven't laughed this hard in the longest time! \"No joke. She walked right up to him and said she liked him. Then bam! He says ew, and she flags him. It was really hilarious. I mean honestly, you don't expect that from college students! But yeah, Lisa is a really good friend,\" Lisa is one of the girls on the Stanford soccer team, who is best friends with Andrew. He's been telling me all about her, and I guess I sort of get the impression that he likes her, but she shoulds so awesome! I mean, who wouldn't! \"I gotta meet her one of these days,\" And I really wanted to. I never want to do that though, so this was a really weird thing for me to say. Then again, I have been saying a lot of things to Andrew that I don't normally say. It's like he can make me give up myself and tell him everything. Must be his foxy eyes. He brought me to this place near the stadium that apparently has the BEST ice cream ever. Well, apart from Coldstone of course. I got a chocolate milkshake. Playing soccer with Andrew must have made me really really tired or soomething, because I was insane thirsty after the game. Or maybe it was the fries i gulped down. Normally I don't eat in front of guys. But of course, Andrew not being a normal guy - well usual guy - I did. I feel like I can be myself around him. Like no matter what, he'll accept me for me. And that is definately something to cherish in a guy. \"Just a milkshake? You sure! They have super banana splits. And I don't like the strawberry part, so I ask for this special double fudge thing, and DAMN! It's crazy good. You should get it. But not too much. Haha this is like a treat for me.\" He looked so energetic. Soccer really was his thing, and I could tell from how into the game he was today. He even has a trainer back home and he runs at least 3 miles everyday. \"Sure, I will have a banana split, but I'm really thirsty!\" Our conversations seemed to flow like natural. Hey - just like in She's The Man. Flow, is flow. Ahh, I love Amanda Bynes. \"That's okay, you can get both. Besides, you are skin n bones. We gotta get some food in you. But seeing the way you devoured those fries today, I can see that you are already trying to do that yourself.\" My cheeks got red and I felt them burn. I could have melted the ice cream in front of me - that's how hot I felt. He laughed at the sight of my face, I presume. \"Hey it's not my fault that I am naturally in good figure Andrew!\" I tried to sound angrier, but I stumbled at the end so it sounded more like I was just breathing the words out quickly. He laughed at me again. I slapped his arm. \"Shit you have big ass arms!\" \"It's called muscle Poppy. Which clearly,\" He took my arm and played with where my bicep was supposed to be, \"You don't have.\" His smile from laughing at me turned into a smirk in an instant. I tried to flex, but his hand didn't seem to move at all when I did. I did what I do best. I stuck my tongue out at him and grabbed my milkshake from the counter, then stalked off. Boys.. . \"Thanks,\" I heard him say from inside the store just as I was exiting. \"Come on Poppy come back! I was kidding, don't over react.\" Was I really overreacting? I mean, he did just kind of insult my body, and then call me freakishly skinny. Not to add that I have no muscle. Yeah, I think that I was allowed to walk away from him. Hell, how I am supposed to get home though? Whatever, I'll walk if I have to. \"Gosh you're trouble!\" His voice was clear through the night. That last word made me stop dead. Trouble. That's what he called me. That was his name for me. I couldn't move. Suddenly I got cold, and I felt my whole body go numb. My legs were swaying uncontrollably to a point where I just fell in the middle of the side walk. I brought my knees up to my chest as I felt the hot tears filling my eyes. Then the warm hand on my back. \"Poppy,\" It was Andrew. Of course. \"Did I say something to upset you? I'm really sorry. I was joking back there, I swear I don't mean it. You're beautiful.\" His voice was strained and sincere. His hand moved to my head and I felt him stroking my hair gently when I felt a breeze and heard his voice closer to me than before. He must have knelt down next to me cause I felt the strong arms around me. This only made me cry harder. Freddie always put his arms around me! But now, he's gone.... *** After I finally had the courage to talk and stop my sobs, I told Andrew everything. He listened without interuptions, which was nice. And when I would occasionally let tears fall, he would rub my back with his hand and wipe away my tears. It was really comforting, and I knew that it was a good decision for me to tell him what was going on. He engulfed me in a big hug when I finally finished. At this point we were both sitting on a sidewalk by the curb, and he had his leather jacket around my petite body. \"I'm really sorry.\" \"Don't be sorry Andrew. It's not your fault. Really, it's mine. I let it bother me...\" I let everything bother me that has anything to do with him. I literally can't listen to some of my favorite songs without thinking about him, since he showed me the songs and we heard them in the car the first date we had... \"I wish I could help. Can I? Please.\" I finally looked up into his eyes. They looked tired, and there was something else there too but I couldn't tell from first look. I felt my head move towards him a little, and looked deeper into his eyes. I felt his hand slowly slide down my back as his face somehow seemed to get closer to mine at the same time. His eyes looked pained. Did I cause him pain? \"What happened to your banana split?\" Totally random question damn I totally know how to ruin a moment! He looked away from me and spoke quietly in response. \"It kind of melted. So now it's just melted ice cream, chocolate sauces, and a banana. You want it?\" I looked over to my milkshake, which I had only drank so much from because Andrew told me it would be good for my throat since it was all clogged with crap from my crying. \"Only if you wanna,\" I tried to smile, but I felt my eyes release more tears while I did this. I haven't cried this much since... Well, since my mom. \"We could share?\" His smile shined through my eyes in the most mesmorizing way. I had to smile in return and of course I sniffed as more tears emerged from my eyes. \"That would be lovely Poppy, but maybe we should go sit someone other than next to the road. I have a feeling our asses will be numb pretty soon - if not already - and we won't be wanting to get up.\" He was right, and as I tried to get up I felt my legs fail. Luckily he caught me before I fell back down onto the street. \"Thanks,\" I mumbled. \"Let's go.\" He helped me walk a little bit until I could control myself on my own. When we reached the car he opened the door for me and handed me the melted banana split. I had finished my milkshake on the way back to the car while my tears dried up. The cold - half melted ice cream - felt good in my throat. He climbed into the car and started to ignition. We had agreed that we would go back to his house and eat it there. I was warmer from his jacket, but suddenly he looked cold. When I went to pull off his jacket that was around me, he stopped me. \"No I want you to have it, I'm fine. Really.\" He must have read my mind. Or my face. I hear that I am pretty predictable. Or maybe it was pretty, readable? Whatever. *** \"Hahaha! That was so good! You're right, that fudge is designed to insure happiness to anyone who eats it. I swear I feel a million times better!\" We had just finished the split, and were currently sitting in his car outside his house. \"See I told you! Amazing right!\" His laugh was grand, and I felt as though I could listen to it all day and not get tired of it. Just wanna hear it again. \"Do you wanna go inside now?\" I looked over at him, and he looked at his watch, then back up at me. \"Yeah maybe we should. Don't want people think I kidnapped you now do I?\" I wouldn't mind that really. Maybe he should. I smiled at my own thought. \"And why not?\" I kept smiling while I waited for his response. \"Because then I can't ever do it again,\" he gloriously smiled at me and let out a small chuckle before he got out of the car and helped me out too. \"This was really fun, I wanna do it again please.\" I said as we walked up towards his house. \"How's tomorrow sound?\" \"Hmmm, I'll have to check my schedule.\" Hey so not nice! Well, maybe he doesn't wanna see me. Maybe this was just out of sympathy or something. Or maybe Kate told him to do this! Ugh I knew it was too good to be true. I felt my smile fade into what looked like a sad look. \"Hey,\" he took my face in his hand as he abruptly stopped and pulled me over before we reached the door. \"I loved hanging out with you. And I definately want to do it again.\" His hand was rested on my waist. And his hand on my jawbone. My mouth opened and closed maybe twice? Yeah, twice. I smiled as he looked down into my eyes. This calmed me down more than ever. I felt myself getting nervous and excited at the same time. Then I felt his chocolate mint breath on my face. It took all the strength in me to pull back from meeting his lips as I saw the light flash on - the one right in front of the door? - and watched Kate slowly open to door. By then we had jumped apart. \"So, how was you guys' night?\" Kate said. Like oh my. I freaking didn't wanna stop writing today. I just had an awful day at school, and i kept writing and writing and writing! Ahhh. Anyway, I should post another one by tomorrow. BTW - I won't be able to post anything on friday, OR saturday. (Saturday if I do, it will be really late) I'm sorry. I wish I could write for you guys cause i know i love it. And hopefully you guys love it too :) Lots of love. Oh & I wouldn't mind some more reviews? Maybe even a nice thank you would be lovely. ;] Em[Chapter 15] Poppy I'm done with all of this nonsense I can't take it anymore I need to live in the present tense And not by who we were before Cuz no offense I'm tired of fighting in this crazy thing We call a love war Why can't you just listen to your heart Instead of listening to your stupid friends I know that that's the reason we fell apart This is not where the story ends But I'm tired of waiting It's so frustrating Do I like you or not? Cuz if I do I'll let you know It's been about 20 minutes, and I have been listening to Andrew sing this song all morning. I've never heard it before, so I assume it's new and he wrote it. It's sublime. I love it. And I don't mind that the song doesn't seem finished, but I have pretty much memorized every word that he has sung. Hopefully he hasn't noticed me sitting outside his door for all this time. \"Okay, Poppy just come inside please.\" Apparently he did know. I laughed and stood up, then entered his room. It looked pretty much the same from yesterday, except I saw a picture. It was of a girl that I didn't recognize. She had dark brown hair with some red highlights. Her tips had some goldish brown color to them too, and she was wearing a soccer uniform and standing next to Andrew while he was holding up a soccer ball. I wonder who that girl is... \"Sorry, I didn't want to intrude of course. Is that a new song you are writing?\" Maybe that was his girlfriend? Or no, maybe that was his best friend Lisa. \"Yeah it is. You like it?\" Of course I like it. But I would love to know who it was about. Unless it wasn't about anyone. Not all songs have to be about someone right? Yeah... Right.. \"Here lemme play it for. I wanna show you something.\" He dragged me down next to him on his bed. He propped his guitar correctly on his lap. Then, he looked up and smiled at me. His eyes were shining brightly and I felt my lips slowly curve into a smile for themselves. This should be a good day... Freddie \"No mom I just missed England that's all.\" Ugh. Mother has been drilling me with questions ever since I got back from America. \"Well, if you missed it then hopefully you will have no trouble at 'tall helping me with some preperations for Abbery Mount before we go back for the next semester,\" I always seemed to be helping her out with school, despite the fact that I really didn't like it that much. The only nice part was all the girls giving me googly eyes - which I would occasionally return and watch the girl faint - but sometimes they would get on my nerves. \"You haven't met up with Thomas since you have been back, have you? He has been calling asking for you for weeks now. I said you were in America, but he knows you are back in England. Why don't you go catch up with him after you help me today?\" I didn't want to help. Not today. That place just reminds me of her, and I am supposed to be getting over her. Why delay the inevitable? My conscious sure had other ideas... \"Yeah mom sure. But I can't I go see him now? So we can do something before it gets too late? I'll help tomorrow, swear.\" \"I guess that would be alright. Be back by 10 though. If you need anything I'll be at the school.\" And she left. Ahh, I get the house to myself for a while until I call up Thomas. Did I really want to talk to him? I'm not positively sure. I'm not really sure of anything anymore really. I hope she's okay. Was she really all I could think about? Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep. \"Hello?\" I answered my cell. The ringtone has changed throughout the past 4 days. First it was 'I'm On A Boat' for about a day. Then I changed it to 'You Think I Don't Care' but that reminded me too much of her - seeing as that was one of our songs. I ended up changing that within 7 hours of putting it there, and it went to 'My Worst Nightmare' by some American band that Silvia had showed me. I really liked them, and ended up using that one for another 2 days. And eventually I decided to keep it, so that's what I heard. Silvia and Poppy - yeah I know I still have Poppy in my special category list - had special rings. \"Hey bro wanna meet up? Your mum told me you were back. How come ya didn't call? Oh screw it. I'll be there in 10. Later.\" Alright that call lasted about 20 seconds. \"Bye,\" I mumbled into the reciever which was directed towards the person on the other line - Thomas - who had in fact hung up. I know how guys are supposed to be all angry and annoyed at their ex all the time. Yet, I can't help but feel the opposite. I love her. And I know that's not going to change. What the hell have I done? Poppy \"So, do people ever call you Drew?\" I questioned him while I laid back on his bed. He had just played his song for me, and told me it was about someone special to him. Or that she has inspired him. Must be his girlfriend, I guess. But I decided to but that complication aside. \"Yeah, sometimes. This guy on my team back home, Andy, he calls me Drewby. I don't know why, he just does,\" he said as he leaned back on his bed. His arm was only centimeters from mine. I stared up at his ceiling. It had a picture of a soccer field, and there was a hug symbol on the center of the field that respresented Stanford. There was also a quote on the bottom of it in black and silver letters. \"Lead and be led,\" I read outled kind of quietly. \"That's right. You know, I say those words before every game. Even when I'm on the field, I'll yell it inside my head to remind myself of my many jobs as a part of a team. I am obligated to always perform to my fullest ability. And I am always glad to get the chance to show my ability.\" He seemed like a determined person who has a lot of respect for soccer, his school, and his teammates. I honor him as a person who always goes after what he wants. Thats an amazing quality that you don't seem to find these days. This got me thinking.... \"I hate you!\" I ran away from him and slammed the door to my room. \"Fine! Go ahead and run away. I'm not coming after you. Just bye Poppy!\" Clearly he doesn't care how I feel. And he doesn't seem like someone who even considered my feelings at all! Why should I even bother with him? Why must I love him. I freakin HATE that I love you! Freddie never came after me. Which just proved even more that he didn't want me. Maybe I was just another one of those Abbey Mount girls he fooled with. Well, he sure as hell is not going to be doing that to me again! \"You know, you're a wonderful person. And I love spending time with you. It's like I can open up to you completely and I don't feel awkward at all.\" I have no idea why I just said that. His expression changed immediately. Shit I shouldn't have said that! Maybe I could lie and say I was singing a song! What kind of song would sound like that though? Damnit I am so scre-- \"I feel the same. I have loved spending time with you too. I'm really sorry about your guy though. I can tell you are hurting,\" his voice dropped low as he continued with the sentence. I shouldn't be shoving my problems on him. He doesn't need to feel bad for me, I really don't want that to be the only way he remembers me. For some reason, I felt like he needed to remember me by something more. Something special. Something, good? I smiled as he continued to talk on about his leadership and soccer team. I would occasionally add to the conversation by asking him a question. Which kept him talking. He seemed pretty comfortable for having a girl on his bed, laying next to him. How long have I even know him for? It's been about - 5 days? Not even a week and I already feel like he is my brother. Andrew had this effect on people. When you saw him smile, you just couldn't help but smile back. It was infecting, and contagious. I liked it though. It kept me partially happy even though I was still hurt from my past screw up relationship. \"Hey,\" I felt a hand touch my own hand which broke my trance of thought. \"You hungry?\" I didn't even think about eating. But now that I had, I was starved. I have been by his room all morning, or in it, all morning. \"Yeah that's probably a good idea. How about pancakes!\" Maybe he doesn't like pancakes. Wow I am stupid. I should let him decide what we eat. He needs to remember me in a good way! Not being a pushy bitch who wants what she wants and when she wants it. I swear, I am the worst at making friends and leaving them with a good impression of me. That is definately something I will be working towards to get better. \"That sounds yummy! Come on, maybe Kate wants to come too.\" I hadn't even thought about Kate! I am such an awful best friend! I came here with her, Kiki, Josie, and Drippy, yet I have barely spoken to them since I have been so caught up in meeting Andrew. But I loved hanging out with him, so it was worth it right? Still, it's like I'm blowing them off or something. Are they mad at me? I think now would be a good time to find that out. \"Okay,\" I said as I hesitantly followed him down the stairs to where everyone should be. I feel like writing. Non-stop. The words keep flowing, and my fingers keep insisting to type! I used to get cramps from typing this much, but apparently my fingers have gotten much much stronger! Ahhh. Well, I should post some more. I have soccer on friday. Its going to be outside. Did i mention that it is -2 degrees with the wind chill? And it snowed today at school? Yeah. I hope I don't get sick and have to skip school again . Actually, that might be good cause then I can write forever!!! :) jk. School is definately important. Em[Chapter 16] Poppy \"Come on it's not like they are mad at you,\" Andrew tried to make me feel better because when I walked into the room and said hello quite loudly the only person who returned it with a decent hello was Josie. Kiki, Drippy, and Kate just nodded their heads towards me. Are they really that mad at me? I didn't do anything wrong. I am allowed to have other friends too. And Andrew just happens to be one of the new ones that I am with. They should accept that. \"But they all are acting like the hate me. Maybe it was bad for me to be with you for so long and not even hang with them. I mean I did kind of come here with them,\" I whispered back to him. He looked taken aback. Ah shit my ruddy mouth! I just practically told him that it was a mistake for me to hang out with him! \"Ah. Well okay, I'll go so you guys can catch up okay. See you around.\" And he left. Great now I have no friends that like me. Why did he overreact? He should know that I loved hanging out and getting to know him! It's been the funnest thing I have done in a long time. Maybe I should do some damage control later. But for now, the girls deserve an explanation. \"Hey you guys can we talk?\" I didn't know how to start this, but this seemed like an okay start to it. \"Oh so you want to talk to us now? Well we are kind of busy but thanks maybe later.\" Shit was Drippy PMS-ing? \"Chill Drip. Where have you been all this time?\" Kate interjected. Well she didn't sound that pissed. I guess. \"I just have been hanging out with Andrew. We just sort of have a lot in common, so we just got talking. Sorry I didn't realize what I was doing. But do you guys wanna go out to breakfast now?\" Please say yes. Please say yes. \"Sure. Lemme get my jacket.\" Josie made a move for the stairs and Kiki followed after. But not before she smiled, hugged me, and whispered \"Glad you're back,\" to me. I'm not really sure how to take that. Did they not like me hanging out with Andrew? I like it, so they should let me do it right? Unless Kate didn't like it then I would understand since he is her brother and all. But Kate didn't look so mad about it. *** \"Mmm this place is good! And I thought that Bob Evans had the best pancakes in the world. But it's nothing compared to this!\" I commented on the pancakes I had got from the buffet at the breakfast place we were at. Apparently the girls all come here whenever there is a break. I can see why. It's delicious. I couldn't help but feel bad, and kind of empty. Andrew wasn't here, and I'm not positive is that's why I was feeling like this. Maybe it was. Maybe it was Freddie not being here. GODDAMNIT CAN I NOT GO 20 SECONDS WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT HIM!? Alright. I should calm down. Yes. Calm. Apparently I had missed a whole conversation while I was having my mental breakdown cause the girls were getting up to leave. I saw the tip already on the table and the plates cleared away. \"You coming 'ere Poppy?\" Kiki asked. She waved her hand in front of my face. I must have zoned out and she thought I was still in a trance. I probably was seeing as it took me about a minute to finally get up and follow Kiki to the car where Drippy, Kate and Josie already were. They said that they wanted to go shopping for this party that Kate's neighbor was having tonight. And they told me about this dress shop. I was kind of dissapointed that they didn't ask for me to make the outfits like I did for us at the school dances. I shouldn't let it get to me though. \"Ooh this purple one would look cute on you Josie.\" I stil hadn't dared to talk to Drippy since the glares from her only increased. Kate, Kiki and Josie seemed to calm down so I could be normal around them. Or close to normal. \"Mhm I rather like purple a lot,\" she held the dress up to her body. \"What do you 'irls think?\" Kate gave a thumbs up, Kiki smiled and said it was good. Drippy did what looked like an attempt a smile, but it looked more like a grimace than anything else. I had to hold back my laughter. That face was priceless. I wonder why she was making it though... Maybe she really was PMS-ing... *** \"Hey mom,\" Kate said as we walked back into her house. \"What ya making?\" \"Oh just potato salad for the Norberry's party tonight. Wanna help?\" Kate's mother looked over at the rest of us who were filing in through the door with our bags in our hands. \"Got your dresses I see.\" She said as she nodded towards are bags. \"From Tannys?\" Kate nodded. \"It's only about an hour away, we should be getting ready.\" Kate stayed behind to help her mom make the food, so I got the room to myself while I could change. I snuck a peak in Andrew's room when I walked by Kate's door. He wasn't there. I wonder where he went off to... I grabbed my bag and threw it onto my bed. I went into the bathroom and showered. My brown hair is naturally wavy when it dries on it's own, and I really didn't feel like straightening it tonight. So I just put it up while I got my black dress on. When I finally let my hair fall down my back, I felt the chill from the cold water in my hair hit my back. I shivered. I heard Drippy laughing from the hallway. I could sense it was at me. And I could also sense that there was a smirk on her face while she laughed. \"You're done?\" Kate walked in with her dress on. She must have changed in downstairs or something. \"Yeah. Just wanted it shower though. Sorry I took so long.\" I didn't know if she was mad or not that I took so long. \"Um, is Drippy mad at me for something?\" Kate laughed. Well this should be a good sign, since it was a nice laugh. Not a sarcastic or arrogant laugh. Just a normal, friendly laugh. \"She has been crushing on Andrew since the day she met him. And now that you just come in and he immediately wants to be friends with you is bugging her. It's okay, she'll come around soon. Besides, Drew won't be here that much longer anyway. She should ignore the jealousy when he's finally back at college.\" I heard the words, and I knew that the last part was true. That seemed to be the only thing that really stuck to me though. He's going to be leaving soon... He probably will still be mad at me, and not want to talk to me. I guess our little day together wasn't anything. Just him feeling sorry for me. Oh well I guess... \"Oh. Um, what should I do? Should I stop talking to him?\" I didn't want to do that, but I knew that he probably wouldn't talk to me again anyways since I kind of dissed him today. Well maybe it was more than kind of. \"Nah don't let her stop you guys from being friends and getting to know eachother. Really, Andrew probably needs a friend right now.\" Okay cool so I have permission to try and make things better between him and I. Why would he need a friend though? Did something happen to him that I don't know about? \"Hey why would he need a friend? Did something happen to him?\" The curiousity in my voice flaring. \"Uh, well maybe I should let him tell you that. He'll be at the party tonight. Well I gotta go okay. Just come next door when you get your shoes and stuff.\" And she walked out. The house was silent. I sat down on my bed and tried to organize my thoughts. This might be a long, painful, heart-aching, night. Well. Bring it. Mmk there's another chapter for ya. I should have the next one up soon. Btw, I got a soccer tourney this weekend! That's why I'm not really sure when I'll have the next one up. Soon though, promise. Lots of love. Em[Chapter 17] Freddie \"Freddie, as you very well may know we are going to the Norberry's party tonight. Their family has been coming to Abbey Mount for decades and we must honor them. So go get your suit on and we will go.\" I hate parties. They are always so boring when I go with my mom. I always end up smiling and trying to act like I am totally into the work my mom does. Which I am most definately not. Well, who knows maybe I'll know some guys from school and then get away from mom. Hopefully. I dragged myself up to my room and quickly brushed my hair a few times. I sprayed some cologne on me and then threw my suit on over my body. It felt cold against my warm skin, and I then jumped onto my bed backwards after I had my suit on. I wanted to lay down for a while and absorb what was about to go down before I got overwelmed, or caught up in whatever was happening. There might be girls from Abbey Mount there. For all I know, Kate will be there. I remember mum saying that her house is right next door to the Norberry's. Maybe her annoying older brother will be there too. He's such an ass. I remember back in 7th grade he was the stud of soccer at our school, and I challenged him to do one-on-one. Next thing I know I am on the ground, and he is standing over me with the ball in his hand. Apparently he scored and then came back to see how my legs felt after I got smashed to the ground. I tried not to hold a grudge against Kate once I knew that she was Poppy's friend, but know I have no reason not to be mad. I never really liked her, and knowing her brother was an ass didn't make matters any better. He always pissed me off. Then from that point on - after the soccer incident - he always was competitive towards me. And since I didn't want to lose any sort of rep that I had, I would accept and then try my ass of to beat him. Yet, he always won. I even got to the point where I would cheat. Except one time I did, he broke my arm. I haven't seen him since that day back in 11th grade. And I'm glad. I walked downstairs and followed my mom out to her car. I wanted to take mine seeing as it was much nicer than hers, but she insisted on driving so I didn't complain much. \"Can I atleast tune on my radio station?\" \"Okay fine honey,\" I never understood why women use those kinds of names. Honey, sweetie, cutie, they all didn't make sense. I cranked on the radio and heard the Plain White T's come on. It was the song, \"1,2,3,4\" and I knew every word to it. I felt like listening this time though. There was something in my mind that was hurting. Then I realized it wasn't my mind. It was my heart. But why? 'There's only one thing;to do;three words for youuu. I love you' Oh now I see why it hurts. I love you. Those words burned deep within, and I knew that I wouldn't be saying them anytime soon. The thought hurt even more. Suddenly I wasn't in the mood for the radio anymore. My mood was ruined and hopefully nobody I knew was there. I am not up for talking. I just want to go home. \"Alright we're here. Come help me bring the cookies in,\" Lovely. We are here. I am so freaking excited for this occasion. Kill me now. Poppy I have been sitting on my bed for the past 20 minutes listening to my ipod. Hoping that it will make me feel better. I really want to make up with Andrew. I feel awful about what happened, and what I said. It was a lie, and totally uncalled for. 'You're so hipnotizing. You got me laughing while I sing, You've got me smiling in my sleep. And I can see this unraveling, your love is where I'm falling. So Please just Catch Me.' 'If I lay here. If i just lay here. Would you lie with me, and just look at the world?' 'No you boys never know. You kidding boys will never know. How the girls feel!' \"Okay Poppy. Let's take a deep breath. Just keep singing. It will make you feel better. Always does, right?\" I can't believe I am talking to myself. I slipped on a pair of black converse - a pair that I haven't worn for over 3 years - and headed down the stairs. I took a deep breath before I opened the door and headed towards the neighbors house. This shouldn't be as hard as I am making it, and if I have to beg for him to listen to me, then I will. I rang the doorbell and once it was answered I smiled and walked inside. I started looking for him. I had no idea what he was wearing, or if he was even here actually. After about 10 minutes of looking I decided to look for Kate and see if she had seen him. \"Hey! Have you seen Andrew? I really need to talk to him?\" I yelled over the music that was playing. It was some Beatles song that I couldn't remember the name to. Kate looked at me and pointed behind me. I turned around. There he was descending the staircase. I walked over to him and tapped him shoulder since he wasn't facing me while he was getting something to drink from this bar that was set up in the living room. He turned his head. \"Can we please talk? I really need to explain myself,\" I just hope he listens and lets me talk. At least, a chance. That's all I am asking for. Is a chance. \"Um why would you want to talk to me? You don't want to hang out with me, so why talk to me? Must be too much torture just talking to me right now isn't it?\" His smark ass remarks are not impressive. Then again, he is only 18. \"Your sarcasim isn't making this easier for me to apologize. I really love hanging out with you. I swear I do!\" This point I was yelling since the music was in the chorus of the song and got much much louder. \"I want to keep hanging out with you if you'd let me! I enjoyed every moment I got to know you, and I only said that I might not have made a good choice hanging out with you because it might have lost me the only friends I had left! Other than you, who I have considered a friend.\" I was still screaming, but apparently the song ended just in time for the whole room to hear the last sentence I had said. Most turned to look at me. Andrew kept his eyes on me, and I kept my own locked with his. I didn't intend to look away. I just hoped he would accept my apology. \"Do you want to go for a walk?\" He said to my surprise. He didn't look mad, but he didn't look very happy either. \"We could go back to your house if you want?\" I suggested. I kind of still was scared that he might leave and I'd get lost. In case he was still mad at me, I didn't want to accidentally make him madder and then he leave me again. But this would be worse seeing as it is nighttime and dark outside. Plus I don't know the area. He looked at me with question as to why I suggested it. He said something in return but I shook my head motioning that I hadn't heard him. He nodded as if acknowledging my confusion. He took my arm and started to lead me through the crowd of people. He was doing a good job of not running into any of the people, even though there were a lot of people there. Lied. I ran into some guy with blonde curly hair. I couldn't see his face as I was on the ground. I saw Andrew's shoes approach my own feet and legs that were on the floor, along with my body. Andrew held out his arm and helped me up. Then I saw who the blonde guy was. Freddie. He must have noticed me too. Not just me though, he was eying Andrew with a sincere look of hatred. What the hell is that about? Is this asshole who I loved with all my heart - or so I thought - hating on the guy who helped me be myself again? And who showed me who I really am. Nobody ever took the time to find out who I really am. Nobody ever wanted to talk about my mom, or about what I liked to do before she died and my whole world flipped. Freddie stood there and continued to stare at Andrew with that death look. Andrew looked back at him with the same level of intensity. \"Come on let's go,\" I heard Andrew casually mumble under my ear. I wasn't sure whether I should follow him or stay with Freddie. This might be the last time that I see him until school starts up again in 2 weeks. Is that a risk I am willing to take just so I can make up with Andrew? Or maybe Andrew would understand if I chose to stay here and talk to him. I just followed what my heart said. I took Andrew's hand that was extended out to me and followed him out the door. Sure, there was a part of me that ached in pain from walking away from the guy I used to love - and probably still do - but i know I made the right decision by following Andrew. But now I wanted to know why the had looked at eahother like that. Was Freddie jealous? No he broke my heart and left, probably doesn't even care about it so why would he be jealous? Must have known him then. Well they do live sort of near eachother so there is always the possibility that they know eachother, except for the fact that Andrew was in college at Stanford. \"How do you know Freddie?\" I couldn't contain the shake that was in my voice as I asked this. \"Woah,\" he looked taken aback and even a little annoyed. \"That's your Freddie?\" was he mad that was Freddie I was talking about? Or maybe he thought I was crazy that I loved him. \"Yeah..\" I said back hesitantly. \"Why?\" \"I know that guy. He was such a jerk to me and my teammates. Always trying to show us up at our game. He never sid though since I finally got pissed and beat his ass for once and all. I think it broke his arm too when he collided with me.\" Okay, so they know eachother. Freddie hates him, and Andrew doesn't like him either. Isn't my life so perfect? The guy who gets me the most, helps me the most, and always knows what I'm like, hates my ex - or maybe still boyfriend. Shit. WOOO!!End of chapter 17. I still have a lot more written, I just have to advance them to the next stage (they are still on paper) but once they are typed I swear that i'll post them. Lots of love. Em[Chapter 18] Poppy As we stepped into the chilly summer night I felt Andrew's hand slowly seperate from mine. I probably shouldn't be bothered by this notion seeing as he is mad at me and was only asking me to go for a walk with him so I could apologize. Hopefully he will listen. \"I'm really sorry. You should know that I loved every moment I had with you. You took me on the best date - or even if it wasn't a date it was still the best time I've ever had with any guy ever! And I was glad that it was you because I always have a fun time with you and we also have so much in common. I'm just really sorry I said that. I shouldn't have, and I'm a complete bitch for doing so. I understand if you don't care and you just want me to leave you alone. I will if you want.\" I stopped talking sensing my eyes were going to fill with tears. If only he could see my face he would know how weak I am right now. Having to choose between my new best friend - or I hope he still is - and my ex boyfriend that I loved very much. That I think I still love... \"You don't have to respond it's fine I'll just go now. You can go back to your life okay,\" his silence made me weaker so I just splashed out whatever came to my mind. I really hope that he doesn't see me cry... I started walking back the way I came thinking he wouldn't follow me. \"Poppy,\" He grabbed my arm and spun me around. I couldn't hold in the tears any longer. The moment our eyes met I felt them slipping down my face. Andrew wiped them away and hugged me. Thank God I have someone who still cares. And thank God that it's him. \"Poppy I'm sorry I hurt you. I completely overreacted. I understand that your friends just missed you and you felt bad. You're right though, maybe I shouldn't have taken you away.\" He mumbled into my hair. I was glad he forgave me, but I didn't like the fact that he found our time together not worth while. I think I cried even more seeing as he pulled me closer into his chest. His arms were wrapped securely around me while his legs were very close to mine trying to block the small wind from hitting them. My arms were lightly around his waist while my head was buried in his chest. We stood on the sidewalk to a street I had never seen before, like that for about 10 minutes from my guess. Finally I looked up feeling that his shirt had absorbed enough of my tears for a night and maybe i should stop. His thumb traced down my cheeks and around my nose. I felt his body move even closer to mine as the breeze started to seem like a wind. I felt the insides of my body screaming, and the pulse of my heart speed up dramactically. Hopefully he didn't hear that... His hand slid down my face continuing to wipe away some of my tears that remained. His other hand was lightly held on my hip. Just as I was about to move in... Beep. Beep. Beep. 'Don't wanna close my eyes. Don't wanna fall asleep cause I miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing' His phone went off. We didn't move at first, but eventually I nodded and said he should answer. I was really dissapointed, but I knew that it would probably be better if I just let him answer the phone. And maybe he would think that I think of his as a rebound guy. I really don't want that. Well, it's not like we were going to kiss or anything... Right? \"Hello,\" he answered his phone with annoyance clear in his voice. \"No I am with Poppy,\" I wonder who was asking the questions because his voice only seemed to get angrier. \"No she didn't Ellie just shut-up.\" Who is Ellie? Must not be a girlfriend since he told her to shut-up. But then again that could just be the way he treats girls? No! How could I think that! Of course he treats them much better than that... \"Where did you hear that from?\" His voice got lower and less audible as this conversation went one. He looked at me and I felt that he needed privacy so I started to walk away. \"Hey! Poppy come back! Ellie can I call you back I gotta go.\" I heard rushed footsteps, but I didn't turn. I only increased the pace I was traveling at. \"Can you stop, please? Why are you walking away?\" His annoyance may have been coming back. Couldn't really tell since my back was still facing him, and I was still walking away into the dark night. \"I'm tired. I had a long night. And you should call your girlfriend back okay. Maybe we can talk tomorrow. And possibly hang out again before you go back to Cali. Might even help you finish your song. Goodnight Andrew.\" I doubt he'll follow me after that. Yeah, i wasn't lying when I said I was tired. But that wasn't the reason why I was walking away. I guess he didn't believe that either. \"No. Talk to me now. I want to talk to you now!\" He placed his hand on my waist. I quickly turned. \"Why do you keep touching me? Just call your girlfriend back!\" I pushed his hand off and adjusted my shirt. Then I turned and continued walking back the direction I had came. \"Damnit Poppy! She's not my girlfriend! And why can't I touch you?!\" He was angry. That was clear. But there was another emotion. What was it? I couldn't really tell actually. Fear? Love? Anxiety? Worry? Lust? I'm not sure. I kept walking but he only let me walk a few more yards before he turned me around again. He pressed his body to mine and leaned in close. Our lips were a mere estimate of 2 centimeters apart. I felt my body get shivers, as I leaned it slowly getting closer to his lips. I turned my head and... \"Andrew? Is that you?\" A stupid girl voice called out and stopped my lips from moving anymore. I knew that voice, I remembered, but I was too caught up in the position I was in - in Andrew's arms and only one slip away from connecting with his lips - to recognize the owner of the voice. Andrew tried to smile but it only looked like a slight smirk to me. \"So close,\" he whispered. I laughed, even though I had a few different ideas as to what he meant by that. \"Hi Drippy what is it? Yes it's me.\" UGH. IT'S HER?! No shit of course it's her I'm such a dumbass. I shouldn't be with Andrew. I should leave so she can just see him alone without me getting in the way like I keep doing. I removed his arms from around me and took a step back. \"I should go,\" I mouthed to him as I continued to back away and towards Kate's house. His face wasn't very visable through the darkness, but I could tell he wasn't smiling. I tried to hug Drippy as I passed her on Kate's lawn. \"I got lost so he found me. Gosh he's so nice haha. Well I'm going to go. Have fun.\" I said to Drippy as I hugged her. She held a content smirk on her face as I walked up the steps and put my hand on the door knob. I snuck a peek back at Andrew before I opened the door. So close... So close... Alright. be honest. Do you guys hate me? For having Andrew such a big thing? I'm sorry but I just love him in this story so much. But Poppy should be with Freddie... Hmm. Well I have some lovely ideas as to how I am going to get them together again. Just wait and see. I swear it will be worth it. Plenty of twists. Lots of love. Em[Chapter 19] Freddie Was that really Poppy I had just seen? And was she really with him? The guy I despised more than anyone. She was with him, and they were together? How did I allow this to happen? She is mine! Not anyone else's and definately not his. I almost went after her as I saw them walk away together. She shook her head at me as she turned and left with him. I wanted to go after her - really I did - but I just don't know how she is going to react. Yes, I love her. Love must not be enough. Well, maybe I did break her heart by leaving, so I should allow her to move on. But it's not like she thinks I don't love her anymore! That thought would be insane. She knows how I feel about her, and she knows that isn't changing. I think... Andrew Oh look. It's Drippy. Kate's annoying little friend who won't leave me alone. Goddamnit. So close Poppy... So close... \"Hi,\" I popped out. I really didn't want to start small talk with this girl. Especially not when she stopped me from kissing Poppy a moment ago. Even though I was having second thoughts about kissing her. It did kind of seem like I was taking advantage of a broken girl. Except she was returning all the effection I dished out to her. So it must that be that bad for her right now. Ha, I bet seeing Freddie just made her life a living hell. That jackass coming into her life just like that again, and all he could do was stand there and watch me help her up. I should have beat him up right there for being such a pussy. What kind of man would do that? I mean really. \"Hello Andrew. How are you? Why'd you leave the party, when you promised me a dance?\" Oh yeah I did promise that. Whoops? \"Yeah sorry. Uh, well Poppy just ran off and I thought she must have got lost so I went to find her.\" I think that was what Poppy said to her... Let's hope so or else I just got us into deep shit with her friends, my mum, and Kate especially. \"Well I'm sort of tired now. So I'm sorry I couldn't dance with you. Maybe next time?\" I said as I started to walk towards her and the door to my house. Secretly hoping that there wouldn't be a next time. OR - that Poppy would be with me the whole time instead of with Freddie Kingsley. \"Of course. That would be lovely. Sleep well,\" She took a step towards me as I was moving slowly puckering her lips toward me. Ew. I turned my head in time for her to just catch my cheek a little. I fake smiled and walked into my house. I heard her sighing through the door and say something really stupid. I slowly walked up the stairs. Now that I really think about it, I am tired. I really do want to go to sleep. Except I sort of need to talk to Poppy before I just go. I knocked on the door to Kate's room which was closed. Poppy opened it wearing boxers and an oversized New England Patriots Jersey. It brought out her defined legs, and her hair was tied back into a bun which only made her eyes sparkle more. She had the cutest face ever. I tried not to smile while I was silently scanning her body. I couldn't find any imperfections that bothered me. She had a very nice body. I wonder how good she'd look in my soccer uniform... That thought slipped out of my mind when her lucious pink lips spoke to me. \"Hey. Sorry for leaving you like that but I just wanted to give you guys alone time,\" Why would she think that I want alone time with Drippy? \"Actually I wanted to talk to you, but that's okay. Can I do that now?\" I hope she's not too tired to just talk to me for a little while. \"Of course, but Uh,\" Her eyes looked me up and down. I felt her eyes lingering on something below my waist and above the knees for a moment longer than anything else on my body. This gesture made my heart shake a little, but I kept my outsides still as best as I could. \"Don't you want to change first?\" Ah yes. I do want to change. Why didn't I think of that? \"Yeah I forgot. I'll uh, go do that,\" I said and walked across the hall to my room. I never stutter around girls. Something must be different about this Poppy more. If only I could have kissed her... So close... I grabbed some clean boxers, my practice uniform, and a towel as I entered my bathroom. The warm water felt good on my body and I washed myself with my Axe shampoo and conditioner. Lisa said it always made me smell like heaven. She would always hold onto me when we were in the hallways just so she could enhale me as we talked together. Man did I miss that girl more than anything! She always made me feel better, and always kept me going when I felt like quitting. Poppy reminded me of her in some ways too. Which probably made me like Poppy more too. I quickly jumped out of the shower and whipped out my towel. I didn't remember if I closed my bedroom door, but I felt like fixing my hair like I would before I went out somewhere nice. Which I could only do while my hair was wet. I slipped on my boxers that I had brought into the bathroom with me and opened my bathroom door. The cold air ambushed me as I stepped out which gave me the chills. \"Oh I'm sorry!\" Poppy said. She was sitting on my bed messing with notebook. Or reading it rather. I'd never let a girl other than Lisa look at that book. Why didn't I really care that Poppy had just looked at it? Probably scanning the contents of it too. \"No it's fine really,\" I'm not sure what I was saying was fine. Was she apologizing for reading my lyrics without permission? Or apologizing for the fact that I just walked out of the bathroom steamy and wearing just boxers? Okay that thought made me mourn for something. Dumbass hormones... \"Uhm, well I'll let you change and then we can talk,\" She looked confused as she was slowly beginning to stand up. \"Ah. Well I normally sleep in this, but if you want me to change so you'd feel more comfortable I will,\" Damn I really hope she's comfortable with it. I wonder what she thinks of me in boxers. I am a pretty appealing guy. Right? Handsome really. And very charming. Plus I'm really strong and athletic. Girls always like that, right? A man who's a strong guy and committed to something? \"That's okay then. So what did you want to talk about?\" She slowly sat back down on my bed with her devil gorgeous eyes staring at me. So, she does like what I look like in boxers, eh? This made me smile, but I quickly turned before she could see it. \"Well I wanted to ask you something really,\" I said as I walked into my bathroom with the stuff for my hair and my cologne. \"Okay, what is that?\" She said a little louder than before so I could hear it from the bathroom. \"About Freddie. What happened tonight?\" I fixed my hair and sprayed my cologne on. I quickly shut the lights off and headed towards my bed where she was. As I sat down my abs curled up and tightened. She noticed them and her eyes widened at the looks of them. Then she replied to me with her eyes still locked on my abs. \"Oh. Uh. Well - He just um, was there. And it was awkward since I haven't seem in him a long time. But I didn't really know what was going on. So I just - yeah. We didn't talk or anything.\" Her voice started getting colder and she eyes looked away to her hands. I saw her jaw tighten as she continued. \"We are over. And we have been since the moment he left me.\" She continued talking to me about how he made her feel during that whole experience. It sounded pretty right - of course he was described as the jackass who broke her heart and didn't seem to give a shit about it. I leaned over and hugged her and I felt her practically go limp to my touch. She was always weak when she talked about Freddie - I noticed. \"I'm really sorry Poppy. And he's an ass for doing that. Definately shouldn't have done that. I would never treat you like that, especially knowing as much as I know about you. There's no way in hell I would do that,\" I took her hand in mine and caressed the top of it with my thumb. \"You know stuff about me? Like what?\" Ah. Shit. I don't want to freak her out right? So I can't say much... Just the basics, right? Yeah okay I'll give that a try. \"Well for one, you are completely exquisite in the looks department. With the most radiant eyes I have ever seen in my life. Your voice softens when you talk to a stranger you approve of, and gets higher when you don't like them. You furrow your eyebrows when you're thinking and bite your bottom lip when you have a new idea. You get easily distracted, especially when an adult talks to you. You don't really like rules or listening to people. You blush every time I compliment you and try so hard to hide it. But you fail miserably,\" I blushed as I finished that last bit up. Maybe I said too much? Or maybe she thought I was a freak for noticing all that. \"Andrew that was...\" She looked deep in thought as if searching for a response to my words. \"Beautiful. You really pay attention to me. Nobody ever does that, and i love that you do. Thank you so much. I just...\" She leaned back on my bed and threw her arms behind her head. I leaned back too, propped my head up on my shoulder and looked at her watching her still thinking of words to say to me. Her lips seemed to be mouthing words as if it was releasing all her thoughts. \"I swear I love him...\" they said. I probably shouldn't have done what I knew I was about to do. Luckily I glanced over at the door before I did it to make sure it was shut. It was to my pleasant surprise. I put my hand on Poppy's right cheek as I leaned over and kissed her full on the lips. Mmm, Cherry. Man! That was fun to write! And I swear I have soooo much more to write!! :) Ahh. Busy busy busy thought. With SSAT to prep for, and soccer 24/7 I'm like dead all the time. Review please if you could ;] they always make me smile. Lots of love as usual. Emmyz (:[Chapter 20] Poppy Everything went by so fast. His hand slipped onto my cheek and then his lips pressed against mine in one swift motion. Those minty lips with the tender feeling of care that graced them as they connected with my own. I closed my eyes as I continued to relish on the moment and enjoy the current situation. So many thoughts were going through my mind at this moment. Freddie. Andrew. I loved Freddie, but Andrew is always there for me and always shows that he cares for me. Plus he is really attractive. His lips suddenly started to pull away. I slowly opened my eyes to see him already staring at me with his own. They were mesmorizing so I just kept staring. In all truth I could stare all day. \"Sorry,\" he said. Damn I sure wasn't sorry for that. It felt so good. But maybe it was wrong. I am sort of linked to Freddie still, and Andrew does have a girlfriend! Right? And then there's always Drippy who is totally in love with him. This would only make her feel worse and boost her self-esteem to an all time low. Oooh I love that band! Anyway... \"Sorry for what? It was yummy,\" Wow I probably sounded like an idiot. He laughed at my stupid ass comment. \"I'm only apologizing because I didn't ask if I could do that. It's not that I disagree with what you said. Because I completely agree. That was yummy.\" His lips curled up into a sweet smile. knowing me, I couldn't help but smile back. \"Oh really?\" I smirked at him and brought my hand up to his face. Then I slowly slid my hand down his cheek and jawbone. It felt good. And it calmed me down for some weird reason. His vibes just made me feel better. His eyes closed as I kept on caressing his face. Of course we always get interupted so it was only a matter of time before someone walked in. I actually thought that somebody would have walked in earlier than that. I guess I got lucky today, seeing as he did kiss me. And it was delicious. \"Have you seen Pop-\" Kate came trudging into the door. Andrew rush whispered me his plan and then made his body go limp. I saw his muscles loosen and it just showed off the more hair that he had on his body. It strangely made me like his body more. He was so real with every part of him. I loved it. \"-ppy?\" \"Oh hey Kate,\" I whispered slowly starting the plan. \"He's sleeping. He was playing his guitar for me,\" I motioned my hand towards his guitar that was on the floor right by the bed. \"And I guess I fell asleep. But I just woke up, and now he's asleep! Weird, right?\" This seemed like a reasonable excuse. Kate bought it though, so it couldn't be that bad. \"Ah alright. Well hey let's go to bed now. I'll be in the room.\" She walked out. Andrew's eyes opened immediately. Then his upper body lunged towards my own - since I was facing the door instead of him - then his lips met mine once more. This time he seemed less careful, but this only made me want him more. I kissed back this time and placed my hand on his cheek while his arms wrapped around my waist. The kiss only lasted about 6 seconds, and then he pulled away. For such a strong guy, I sure felt safe in his arms. And I really liked it. \"I should probably go,\" I stuttered while trying to say this. He smiled. Maybe he likes that he makes me nervous. Or that I am just a shy person? Possibly. I'll have to ask him later. \"Yeah,\" His smile grew as he let his hands slip from around me. It suddenly felt colder in the room. I shivered as I stood up from his bed. He got up too and hugged me. I didn't expect it, so my arms were lamely hanging down my sides while he hugged me. *** \"Oh my gosh, what is that look on your face?\" Kate nearly tackled me once I stepped into our room and sat down on my bed. Apparently my expression wore exactly how I was feeling. Smitten. My mom always said that I was so open with that by the look on my face. \"Nothing. Just really like spending time with your brother. He's really funny,\" He is really funny. And he's handsome, and plays guitar. Plus he is super athletic, amazing soccer player, good kisser, and likes me for me. What more could I ask for. \"I knew you'd like him,\" She smirked. \"So how was the party? I didn't really see you there.\" Kate started to pick up clothes that had started the form a pile around her own bed, and threwn them in the hamper in her bathroom. \"Oh uh. Well I saw Freddie, so I kinda left. And then Andrew came to find me...\" My voice trailed off. Saying Freddie's name still hurt me. Who knew that love could hurt a person so much? \"Woah woah woah. You saw Freddie?\" She sounded surprised but it definately wasn't an excited surprise. \"What the bloody hell did he say to 'ou?\" I love how my friends always assume that he did something to me. \"He didn't say anything. Just sort of glared in shock after he knocked me down. Then Andrew helped me up, and we left. So hey, why didn't you tell me that Andrew and Freddie have a past? Like they knew eachother?\" Kate did know a lot about Freddie back when I first met him, but she never mentioned that her brother was the influence to this knowledge. \"Right. Well I guess it slipped my mind. And I wanted you to be happy because I knew if I told you then you might want to defend me or Andrew and go against Freddie. Which I didn't want at the time. But not, do whatever you want about it I guess.\" It would have helped to know that she knew him other than at Abbey Mount. Because clearly there is more to him than meets the eye. Do I want to find that out? \"I'm rreally tired. Can we talk in the morning?\" After she yawned and nodded in response to my question/comment, she went into the bathroom. Tonight, I don't want to think about Freddie. Tonight, I am going to think about Andrew. And what I am going to do about him. Wow I hope this doesn't end bad... Well there goes another chapter. Lets see.... I need your guys' input on this. How far should I go? Just up until they are ready for school? Or what.? I need to know before I post anymore. Cause if it's ending soon then I gotta wrap it up in maybe 5 more chapters. Lots of love. Please Review it helps me. Em[Chapter 21] Poppy I felt my legs cringe as I got up. As I stepped out of my bed and headed toward the bathroom I realized just how puffy my eyes were. According to the mirror I have been crying all night. Now that I think about it... \"Trouble. You know I've never felt this way about anyone before. And you mean so much to me.\" his hand caressed my cheek while my hand slid down to my waist. Oh how much those memories made me sad. I miss him so much, but then again I don't. He hurt me when I was so broken and vulnerable. Right when I was about to let people into my world after those empty years without my mom. \"Freddie I don't quite know what to say. I never have had such strong feelings for a guy before, and you know me so well it's just I've been hurt in the past and I--\" His lips crashed into mine knocking me back slightly but his hand slipped to my back and caught me. I threw my arms around his neck and hoped that I was strong enough to stay on my toes and continue to reach up, and kiss him. I continued knotting my fingers through his curly blonde hair while he helped support my weight. Seconds after the kiss was deepened he picked me up and tucked my legs around his waist. My hands stayed linked to his neck as our faces never seemed to split apart. I jumped into the shower and turned the nozzle to the right for the most part. The hot water attacking my skin in gulfs was calming and painful at the same time. But I just closed my eyes as I tried to unknot my hair with the lavendar conditioner I had brought from home with me. Kate's body washed mixed pretty well too, it was fresia. As I got out of the shower, I Remembered how I forgot to take clothes in with me. Hopefully nobody sees me, because I had a feeling that my eyes were still puffy and red despite the hot shower. The cold air hit my skin almost instantly. The towel I had wrapped around the middle of my body felt like it wasn't there. I forgot how cold England gets, and especially how chilly in the morning. I slowly tiptoed over to my suitcase and started rummaging through it looking for my essentials for the day. \"Hey Kate where's my--\" I looked up from what was in my hands only to see a dumfounded Andrew standing in the doorway looking at me. First I felt embaressed. Then angry. But finally I go shy and focused my gaze on my hands. \"I am so sorry I wasn't thinking at all,\" He said. I still felt his eyes on me, so I knew he that he hadn't moved an inch since he spoke those words of apology. \"It's alright. I just wasn't thinking when I forgot to take my clothes with me in the bathroom. I think Kate is downstairs if you are looking for her,\" I felt my face slowly ascend upward to face him - or most likely start heading back to the bathroom to get some clothes on. \"Have you been crying Poppy?\" He took several steps forward until he was just inches from me. I didn't move, and I didn't respond. Hopefully he would just drop it and let me change. Hopefully he doesn't try to talk about it right now. Because I doubt I can talk about what I dreamed about last night while in just a towel, while with the boy who I think I am slowly falling for right now. Heck no. \"Yes, but it's nothing really, I swear.\" \"It doesn't seem like nothin. Will you want to talk about it after you get changed?\" Okay so atleast he is reasonable. He's going to let me change. I couldn't help but that think that Freddie wouldn't let me get comfortable in my own clothes. All he would do is make me sit and talk to him now. Did I like that he was pushy? Or did I completely utterly hate it? Not sure... \"Sure just gimme a bit,\" He nodded and I went into the bathroom to change. Millions of thoughts were running through my mind at this moment. Then I remembered, that Freddie wasn't the only one I dreamed about last night... \"Hey Drew how was the game?\" I approached Andrew who was drenched in sweat and had a t-shirt over his uniform top. He hugged me as he stepped towards me to talk. \"That last goal was for you,\" he kissed my cheek and I hit him playfully. \"You are all sweaty! Don't hug me then I'll smell,\" I smiled. Talking with him felt so natural. Now that I go to Stanford with him, am on the lacrosse team, and get to watch him play soccer or write songs everyday. Being together is perfect. I couldn't help but make my smile grow at these thoughts. \"Ah come on,\" He slowly came towards me as I slowly backed away from him. \"It's just salt water. You know it's good to sweat, right Poppy? Hmm,\" He lunged and picked me up and his free hand started tickling me while I was over his shoulder. I squirmed and screamed begging for him to stop. \"Drew...Please...Ha! Ow.. It .. Tickles! Ha! Andrew!\" Damn this boy doesn't give up. \"Put...Ha! Me... Down!!\" I managed to get out. \"Put you down? Very well then.\" He stopped tickling me as he walked over the campus and back to the dorm where I was staying at. Luckily I got the sophmore/freshman dorm, which was the same one that Andrew was at. Which made it all the better for slumber parties and late night chats. \"Where the bloody hell are you taking me? I asked you to put me down!\" I looked at him with confusion as he only helped but laugh at me. \"Oh fine then. You wanna go down? Then here ya go, here's down,\" I felt his arms loosen from around me as we were standing near the fountain in the middle of the garden. It was only 6, but the sun was fading away into the clouds so there was a blanket of midnight blue over the sky. My mind quickly grasped what he was about to do. \"Don't you dare drop me in there!\" I gripped onto him tightly before he could let me drop into the fountain. My eyes wide with exhaustion, and a slight mixture of fear. \"Ahh, so you don't want me to drop you?\" He smirked. I can really tell he's enjoying this!!! \"No Drew. Please don't put me down,\" I smiled sweetly. His charm was clearly too much for me to handle right now. I always gave into him. God knows why, but it kind of made our relationship interesting. \"Of course I won't drop you darling. Just gimme a kiss,\" He puckered his lips and motioned for me to kiss him with his free hand that he took off of my waist. I felt myself slowly getting closer to the ground and knew that it was my cue to lean in. I met his lips right where they were and put everything I could muster up, behind it. His lips fought back mine with passion and desire as his hand found it's way back to my lower back. It felt good, and I felt the strength of his biceps against my petite - somewhat muscular - body. I didn't want to stop, so I didn't. It wasn't until I felt his head recline the slightest that I knew we should be heading back to our dorms to start on some essays that would be due the following monday. \"That's all I asked for. Not so hard, was it?\" He smiled his heart melting smile. I felt my body shake with the chills as I nodded with awe. \"Do you want to be put down now?\" His voice softened as he spoke. We had some how moved over toward a bench in the park - which was not anywhere close to the fountain. I shook my head. \"I think I'm good right here,\" I smiled in response to his smile and he leaned in again planting a kiss on my forehead. Then my cheek. My heart nearly jumped out of my chest. I had the feeling that I could get used to this... I stared back into the mirror feeling the hairs on my head standing up with the chill that was posessing my body. I threw on the jeans that I had brought into the bathroom with me, and matched them with the red and black tank top. I threw on a jumper and took a deep breath. If anything, I should be happy. He cares about me, and I shoulld want to return that. I took a deep breath stepping into the room feeling the cold air hit me once again. \"Let's talk.\" Yeah! Another chapter... Ideas guys... I need them... :) Oh, and 3 day weekend coming up! I have a soccer tourney so idk how much I can post... but I'll try my hardest I swear. School has been a madhouse. I'm pretty good with updating though, right? :) Lots of love. Review please. Em[Chapter 22] Freddie \"So that was Poppy. That was the girl from school? She didn't look like it. I thought she was blonde?\" Thomas has been annoying me with questions all afternoon. All about Poppy too, which makes me mad. I am trying to convince myself I don't like her anymore! And that leaving her was the right thing to do! Yet everyday I can't help but feel that Ellie is so wrong. \"Yes Thomas, Tro-Poppy,\" Damnit I can't even use her name without thinking about what I called her. \"Was the girl I ran into. She was with Andrew too.\" The last part I didn't need to try and sound discgusted. It came naturally with saying Andrew's name. \"Dude. Ever wonder if Ellie is wrong? What 'ou did would be a bit mean. If she was wrong of course. Just leavin like dat?\" No shit Thomas. To think that he doesn't even know how much I am in love with that girl. Or rather - was in love with that girl... I think. \"Yes,\" all i could say apparently. My mind was wandering. Only stopping at the images of Poppy Moore. \"There are plenty of fish out in the see. You can always get over her?\" I just nodded. Sad part is, I don't want to get over her. I want to get her back. \"Freddie, You can take Tom with you but you must go into town and pick up some things for me! Don't forget I need them by 5 tonight!\" My mum yelled up the stairs. Maybe some fresh air might change my mind? Poppy \"Can we talk about this later?\" I really didn't want to talk about this. Not right now at least. Not with my mind second guessing what I did last night. But that dream of Andrew at school with me was just perfect... And that one with Freddie just made my heart buzz. \"Of course, come on let's get some breakfast.\" Andrew hugged me and looked down at me on my bed with his eyes locking on mine. \"You looked like you needed that. Come on let's stop crying now please.\" He wiped away the spare tears that happened to build up on my face and rub off the mascara stains on my face. Never wear mascara to bed. Especially if you are going to have a night like that... I took his hand and we got up after I thanked him. \"Goodmorning sunshines!!\" Josie yelled from the table. She had blueberry pancakes on her plate and bacon. Ooh how I loved bacon. \"Gimme!\" I ran away from Andrew and sat next to Josie while reaching and taking her bacon. She smirked as Andrew laughed at my motion and took a seat next to Kate. Drippy stared at him. It made the pits in my stomach want to punch her. \"So how did you ladies sleep?\" Andrew asked not directed towards me even though he glanced at me while he said this. I tried to smile. \"Lovely,\" Drippy said with a smile on her face. I need to know what happened after I left Andrew alone with her last night... \"I feel like shit. Too much pop last night,\" Kiki groaned as she buttered her toast. \"I slept quite well. Oh and Thomas called me at like 2 am. It was odd since I haven't talked to him since last semester.\" That is odd. And seeing as he is one of Freddie's best friends. That just made it 20x odder. Andrew seemed to drop his happy mood. Maybe Thomas was just as bad as Freddie when it came to sportsmanship. \"I slept like a baby really,\" Josie smiled as if ignoring the obvious tension in the room from Kate's comment. \"But I sort of ruined my last jumper, so I need to run into town today to get another one. Wanna come 'uys?\" She looked at us all. Andrew looked away. \"Hey Drew would love to come! He can carry the bags!\" Way to go Kate!! I secretly smiled but tried to hide it as Andrew looked to me for support. I just nodded at him while I still contained my smile. \"Uh yeah that would be great.\" His eyes rolled and a smile appeared on his soft lips as he spoke. Knowing me, I was probably smiling now too. \"Settled then. Ladies we shall have a night in the town, and Andrew will 'arry the bags!\" Kiki still mopy looking, said this. She always seemed to want to be in charge for the 'plans' we would have. Drippy looked very interested too. I wonder why? I smirked at my own stupid question. \"Ah let's get dressed then,\" Drippy ran up the stairs and was followed by the rest of us. \"Thanks for the support girly,\" Andrew whispered as he nudged me. I smiled and stuck out my tongue. How Poppy Moore of me. \"See ya in a few then,\" He walked into his room and closed the door. I then followed Kate into hers. I was already dressed, so I didn't really know why I was in here. And I think that Andrew was dressed too. Maybe I should go see what he is doing? \"I knew he liked you,\" The voice startled me. Kate's. \"What?\" Playing idiot won't help me right now. Then again maybe he doesn't like me. He does have a girlfriend... Or atleast that's what I know to the best of my knowledge. \"Poppy I've known you long enough to know when you are lying to me,\" She was right. But then again most people don't need to know me seeing as my face normally gave it away from the expression. \"He doesn't like me,\" Was all I said. \"Don't be daft. He likes you, and you know 'it,\" Now would not be a good time to smile. It was a challenge though because my lips seemed to be begging to spread across my face. \"What about Drippy?\" I seemed to be avoiding her comments but just countering them. \"What about 'er? Poppy if he likes you then there's nothing you can do about Drippy's feelings for him. Just try not to flaunt it around her. That's it. Maybe you should stay by me today?\" This was probably a good idea. Except, that probably meant that Drippy would be near him. What a ball. \"Let's go then I guess,\" I grabbed my purse and headed for the stairs. I met Andrew there who smiled at me. I nodded and continued walking. Okay, so this was kind of a filler. I still need those idea's guys!!! Ahh. Well next chapter should be a bit better. Lots of love. Review please. Em P.S. i just saw the movie Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging which made me just die to read the books. I am currently on book 4. And damn these are hilarious. Haha well anyways, just thought I'd tell ya. :) Byee[Chapter 23] Poppy \"Can we sit? My legs are kinda tired from all the walking,\" Kate said with an exasperated look on her face. She plopped down on a bench that was nearby and put her legs up on it while closing her eyes. \"Ah thanks I see,\" Josie said deliberately making it obvious this comment was directed towards Kate. \"We must find another bench!\" I laughed and sat under a tree on the roots. I was so tired I could sit on the ground without being bothered and be totally comfortable. Kate still hadn't opened her eyes as the girls went to find a bench nearby. Andrew had said he was going to be right back and wondered off into the street. Kate spoke to me suddenly. \"Hes upset. I think it's cause he thinks you're ignoring him.\" Well I know he looked tired but I didn't think he was upset! \"Well you asked me to stay away for Drippy's purpose, so I am. I'm not mad at him so he shouldn't be upset. Besides he has a girlfriend.\" I added that last bit quite matter of factly turning my head the other way even though this gesture would go unnoticed as Kate's eyes were still closed. \"Bloody hell he asked you to be his girlfriend?!\" Her voice went load and suprised, yet her eyes were still closed. \"No of course not! Like he would ever ask me...\" My voice was breaking so I quickly replied with whatever. \"She's from his college. And - he is much older than me. So uh...\" Why did I feel like crying so bad right now? \"He's got a girlfriend from college? That's a surprise. Never told mum either... \" Her voice went quiet as she started to mumble to herself so it was barely audible. Well maybe not all guys tell their moms about having a girlfriend? \"Ah, well I should just forget it right? That he appears to look like he likes me. When he doesn't. So uh... And well I also have Freddie to worry about. He called me and I just...\" I kept going and rambling on and on about useless things. Kate didn't seem to listen much anymore. Not that anything I ever said was interesting except for that one time I wanted to escape from Abbey Mount forever. Life is so god damn awful. Andrew Apparently I have a girlfriend? That I haven't told my mom about?! Come on Kate you know I don't have one if I didn't tell mum! Don't be dim and not tell Poppy!!! I'd been standing there behind a nearby tree just reading my ipod touch's manual when I heard Poppy and Kate talking about me. At first I smiled at Poppy mention me with such enthusiasm. But that smile quickly faded when I heard where the conversation was going. And me not wanting her in any way, shape of form which was complete bullshit. I wanted to just jump out and kiss her, but then I'd look like a cheating boyfriend? But that's only if she doesn't believe me when I tell her that I don't have a girlfriend. Could I possibly use this little secret to lure her in. Girls always like taken boys, right? Right. Hopefully I don't get too far in that I can't get out though... Oh shit look who just came stroddling through the damn park. Freddie. Man I hate him. Not just for what he did to me, but what he did to Poppy. What guy would ever just leave a girl like that? And especially ever leave Poppy. Well I guess it's time for me to show my face before they all see Freddie and Poppy falls for him all over. What does she see in him anyways? He's blonde, and they are so unattractive. Especially with his big nose and dumb beauty mark that's on it. \"Hey ladies,\" I walked over and winked at Poppy then Kate. My little sister had her eyes closed but motioned her hand in a waving way. Must be tired from being on the phone with James all night. Yeah I heard her. Sounds like she's a lovestruck teenager. \"Hey,\" All Poppy said. I went over and sat next to her hoping that she would stop ignoring me. I don't see why she would though. I didn't catch that part from their conversation. \"Missed you. Are you going to talk to me now?\" I grinned hoping she'd give in to me. Or maybe grinning was mysterious? That's what Kate always said to me. \"Oh. Sorry. Just a bit sleepy, you know?\" Her eyes drooped but not in a tired way. More like a stressed out kind of way. I brought my arm around her shoulder. I know I am supposed to act like I have a girlfriend for my plan, but I just can't seem to worry about that when she looks in pain. I felt her move slightly away which only made me tighten my grip. She gave in and cuddled into me. I wonder where Freddie went. Little bludger. I heard footsteps though. I started to stroke Poppy's hair in hopes that she would fall asleep. She told me that she's a sucker when it comes to that. She always falls asleep when someone does that. I watched her forehead snoop more into my chest and shoulder blade. Her hair smelled of lavendar and fresia. It was absolutely delightful. I wouldn't mind staying in this position all day as a matter of fact! Bloody hell Kate really? \"Bahhhh!!\" She made her dramatic awakening shake Poppy but I held her tighter in hopes she would stay sleeping for a while longer. At least until Freddie is gone or has seen us and made a run for it instead of moving in on me. Kate looked over at me with her arms across her chest and a wide smirk on her face. \"Shhh, keep it down,\" I learned from Kate that when girls cross their chests it means that they are nervous or self-conscious. Mmk that's the end of chapter...23? Yeah i think so. Haha idk anymore. Cause i just write them and then post them randomly. Humf. Soccer soccer soccer. -- It sucks the life out of me really, but it's what I love so hey! It's what I'm gonna do :) Em[Chapter 24] Freddie Well looky looky who we have here! Why the he'll is he always with her and why does it seem like they are following me? Ha I bet Poppy made this plan so I would be jealous! Well, I won't let it work. I stepped closer towards them just watching. I could see the smile plastered on her warm beautiful face. She didn't have any makeup on from the looks of it, but it only made me love her more... Those lips of hers so juicy and pink with cherry flavor. It makes me to crazy when i felt those, yet I only mourned to touch them again and again and again.... \"Hi Freddie,\" My train of thought was broken with Kate's - what sounded like forced - words. \"Hello. Fancy meeting you here eh?\" Not really since Poppy probably planned this. I bet she's not really sleeping either!! \"Indeed. We were shopping in town and picking out presents for my mum,\" she pointed towards a bench nearby. When I turned I saw 3 girls looking at me in shock. Kiki, Josie and Drip from the looks of it. Of course these girls go everywhere together. \"And they came to help. But we all wanted a quicky break.\" \"Ah yes I understand. I'll be going then to let you get back to your rest. Maybe we should all catch up before school starts up again?\" I sounded hesitant with inviting them to hang out, and Kate noticed. I hadn't glanced at Andrew since I came over here, but when I looked just a moment ago there was only a look of pure hatred. I watched his arms tighten around my Poppy. I felt like slaughtering him. His smug smile only made me wanna beat his ass right now. I could yank Poppy off and then grab him while he's off guard. He'll regret ever touching my baby. \"We should really be going now,\" Andrew said to Kate barely unaudible for me. Of course he doesn't want Poppy to wake up and crawl back into my arms like she always does. And I'm not being arrogant because it always happens. To my surprise I saw him pick up Poppy who was craddled in his arms. Like carrying a bride at a wedding... His arm dangled across her ass for a couple moments which made me flinch. He's trying to provoke me! Even if I did hit him right now I bet all the girls would back him up and I can't hit a girl. Plus Poppy would get hurt. And in which case that would also hurt me... So I just stood there watching him touching Poppy. Why did I ever leave her in the first place? That question never seemed to be answered. And I really think I should find a reason before I break down all over again... Poppy I woke up feeling dizzy and tired. My eyes were still closed so it was dark - wherever I was. I heard faint whispering next to me though. Was that Kiki? Or Josie? Couldn't tell... \"Why did he call you? Did he say why?\" a voice asked. \"No he just said that 'you know who' has been a wreck and a disaster since she's been gone. And he's worried about him,\" Okay I recognized that voice. Kate. \"Oh. So it is about him. Why is it always about that boy? First he leaves. Then he goes off with some other girl on a limb that Poppy cheated. I mean hell even if she did Poppy and Freddie are so soulmates! You see that look in her eyes when she sees him...\" The voice faded off and was interjected with another persons. But this one was deeper and probably a guys. \"Yeah. But he broke her heart and stomped on it. He doesn't deserve to have her,\" the guy said. \"Don't let your personal feelings get in the way of this now...\" Kate's voice whispered. Must have been directed to the guy because I heard a puff in that low voice again. Maybe it's time to open my eyes to see what's going on. Especially since it is about Freddie and I. \"Hey you're awake! You slept for a long time there girly,\" Josie poked up just as my eyes opened and attempted to adjust to the light in the room. Which wasn't too hard since it was a restraunt of some sort that had low lighting. \"I did? How long? I don't remember a thing...\" Which wasn't all that true. I remembered the park and having Andrew wrap his arms around me in defence of Freddie coming up. But even then it was only faint memories. Maybe sleeping so long put damage to my brain! Any how, where is Andrew right now? I looked around for him. Drippy was next to him with a small smile on her face. I guess she likes him sitting next to her and ignoring me. Yeah, great. \"4 hours,\" Kiki said with even some surprise in her voice. She reached for a bread roll and started to butter it. I looked up to Kate as if that would help me figure something out. Because I did sense the tension emanating from the table. Yet the rest of the room seemed to be oblivious. The booth we were in was probably the biggest I have ever seen. It felt like one of those boxes you can be in at a basketball game, except the cushions were 20x squishier. And the lights were dim. \"Where are we?\" I wondered aloud. \"Burkes. They have the best fish n chips round here from what I hear,\" Drip said. She took a sip from her tall glass which appeared to hold soda in it. \"We haven't ordered yet though. Waitin' for you,\" she said. Her voice seemed to choke at the end. I wasn't sure if that was because of her drink or me having her wait so she can get food. I think that ever since Freddie and I got split up, she and I have somehow distanced our relationship also. It might also have a thing or two to do with Andrew, but I'll save that issue for later. Right now, I was strangely really hungry. \"Well let's eat then,\" I smiled and looked to Kate who looked a bit surprised at my reaction to Drippy's semi-rude comment but eventually she returned my smile. \"Waiter!\" *** \"Man that was sooo good! I love fish n chips. Except I still don't get why they call fries chips?\" I threw my jacket off and plopped down on the couch in the living room. Kate straddled in after me with pure exhaustion on her face. \"Not sure Poppy. Where'd you get so much energy from? Maybe I should take a 4 hour nap sometime and see if it does much good to me...\" She seemed to be thinking out loud at the end of her sentence. Fun fun fun fun fun. I dunno where I got all my energy really. I just sorta wanted to do something. And I was willing for anything! \"Wanna go to a water park?\" I asked. \"Uhm I would love to! That's a good idea, except it's kind of windy. So this might not be the best weather to do this in?\" Kate said matter-of-factly. Humf. \"That's why we will go in all our clothes. It's sooo much fun! Really, I do it all the time.\" Okay, that's a lie cause I barely ever do it but still it is definately the funnest thing. \"I guess. Well good luck asking the girls, cause I gotta go take my nap now. Lata.\" Kate walked up the stairs without a second look back. Hopefully the other girls will be most willing. \"Hey!\" I yelled at them as the slowly came in the door. \"Wanna go to the water park with me?\" Kiki, Drippy, and Josie all stared at me with blanks expressions. But Andrew to my surprise immediately perked up. \"I'd love to! Come on let's go before it gets too dark,\" he headed towards me and was holding out his hand to help me up from the couch. \"I want to go too!\" Drippy said. Well of course. I smiled at her and nodded. Maybe she'll share Andrew with me today. Andrew helped me up as Kiki and Josie passed and headed up the stairs. This should be fun, eh? End of chapter 25. Huh. Well I wanna write more for each chapter, but this is the only way that I can get out so many \"quickly\" in this such fashion. Reviews are cool ;) Em 3[Chapter 25] Poppy How does it seem that everytime I think I've had enough, something gets worse? Here I am sitting in Freddie's car with his arms wrapped tightly around me. I some how knew that I would find my way back to him, but I never thought it would be because I just randomly left Andrew and Drippy at the water park. Come to think of it, I'm not quite too sure why I left anyways. All I saw was them kissing right in front of me. Of course I left after that without an explanation, but then again it was probably a stupid move of me since I'm not from around here and have no idea where I was going. Except seeing as Freddie is my soulmate - so it seems - he found me. In my time of need. And this time he was there for me. \"So you ready to tell me what happened?\" He stroked my back rubbing circles on it. It was soothing, and probably helped me calm down from my crying which I had been doing ever since I saw him come up to me. I haven't even spoken once since then. I'm probably more or less crying because of him. I just nodded and made a small groan. He smiled softly and tried to make me talk by nodding in encouragement. \"Well,\" Okay so I didn't really know what I was going to say. Hopefully I don't sound like an idiot. \"I got lost,\" Hmm that hope is definately done for. \"And here I am?\" Most definately made my IQ level drop at least 100 points. Or possibly it killed millions of brain cells! All I know is that I was talking like a 5-year-old on crack. Which is not good. He chuckled and continued to rub circles on my back. \"Yes I have found you, but where were you?\" The real question is why did you leave me Freddie Kingsley? What did I do? \"Water park,\" I spoke. Sulking that you weren't with me anymore... \"Were you alone?\" What a dumb question. \"No,\" I whispered. My voice shaking for a reason - that I am not quite aware of. \"You're not making this easy. Who were you with? And why did you leave them?\" \"Well here,\" Anger and frustration getting the best of me as I continued to speak now with sudden confidence in my voice which I haven't heard in a while. \"I'll make is easy for you. I left my friends because I wasn't feeling happy. And I don't have a boyfriend on top of that because he just left me for no apparent reason! Plus, he doesn't have the decency to even tell me why he left in the first place! Does that clear things up for you?\" He looked shocked and hurt all in one expression plastered on his face. Then his mouth opened, closed, and opened again all within a matter of seconds. He wanted to speak, but couldn't find the words. Now that was shocking. He was always one good with his words. Even in the worst of situations. And this was definately in my top ten list of those. His lips trembled the slightest as he seemed to find the right words. \"Poppy, you must understand what was happening with me at the time I left. If I could chose to do this all over again, I swear I'd take it back and-\" \"Well you can't. There's not one ounce of hurt and pain you can take back now Freddie Kingsley. I've felt it, and it's too late. The least you owe is an apology! And I def-\" He cut me off just as I had cut him off moments ago. \"Would you just give me a chance to finish? And I was getting to that...\" Referring to apologizing I presume. \"Poppy, you know I love you,\" HOLY SHIT. \"And that I only left because I thought it would be best for you,\" HOLY SHIT HE LOVES ME AND HE SAID IT! \"Not only because I was taking you away from your friends and life, but because of how wrong I am for you. I was just trying to protect you. Because I love you. If you could believe that?\" His eyes were shining with eagerness and misery. I stayed quiet attempting to give him a chance to finish. \"These past few weeks have been killing me inside and out. I am a wreck without you. You always kept me the same as to who I was. Now, I barely even recognize myself. I felt a massive part of me ripped out the moment I walked out on you, and even though I kept trying to fill that whole, I have realized it's not possible. My love for you is inevitable, and there really is no use in trying to put it off for such a reason. Even to my better judgements,\" I felt my eyes try to burst with tears. It took every damned muscle in body to hold them in for just a while longer. \"I need you Poppy. More than I need air.\" My heart was fluttering to a maximum speed while he spoke. I never thought he would say that, and this looked like a lot to process all in this short period of time. When I'm with Freddie though, I felt like I had all the time in the world. The moments would just tick by like the clouds float across the sky, but my eyes would continue to stay locked on his. \"I'm sorry,\" he mumbled and looked down removing his hand that was currently placed on my back from his attempts to calm me down earlier. Now it seemed as though I would be the one trying to calm down him. \"For what? Loving me?\" I knew it seemed like an arrogant question in a way, but I didn't say it like that. Or at least I didn't mean for it to be. His immediate rebuttle showed me another edgier, worried side of him. \"No! Of course I don't regret that. I always love you, and I am never sorry for that. Even if it may seem wrong for me to do that...\" His yelling - interupting - voice softened and slowly faded as he spoke his words of defeat. I tried to make him meet my intense gaze that I currently had on him, but it didn't seem to be working. \"Hey,\" I touched at his collarbone hoping my cold hands would make him raise his head. It did. \"Can you just answer me one thing?\" I asked in a whispered tone. I had clearly calmed down. Sometimes I swear I am so bi-polar! Being a girl sucks so much at times! Freddie nodded and I asked my question with pure wonder in my voice. \"Why did you leave?\" He cleared his throat as if this would be one big thing he's ready to open up about. At least it's good that we are telling the truth now, right? \"I felt guilty Poppy. There was this girl,\" Of course it was another girl! It must have been his stupid friend that he made! And then he cheated on me, felt bad and left! I knew it I knew it I knew it!!! \"And she's been a family friend for a long time but she kind of had this really big thing for me,\" Okay so it's not his little friend he made. But it is a girl who likes him. And a family friend? I'm not quite sure what to think of this... \"She tried to make me be with her, and she'd tell me all these horrible things she supposedly knew about you,\" Alright so it's some stupid friend that likes lying and talking shit about me? Just wonderful. \"But I never believed her! I always defended you and well - okay so next thing I know she's trying to make me do her. I didn't know what was going on. I was thinking of you the whole time, and she took advantage of me. We were still together, and I felt horrible. I just missed you, and then that happened...\" His eyes started to lose their normal spark they witheld and dropped to a plain tired, sad look. \"I didn't want to hurt you. And I knew that being with you after that might affect you. Plus I also knew how bad I was for you. And I changed you? I really am not supposed to have done that. It's not good to change someone like that... I'm really sorry.\" His eyes finally just drooped down completely and I heard him sniffle slightly. Was he crying? Surely not. \"Freddie. You aren't bad for me. And you didn't change me. Well, I guess you kind of did, but it was mostly me changing myself! It was for the better. I wasn't acting like my true self, but you helped me get in touch with it again. Thank You. And don't be sorry,\" I always give in way too easy. This boy has a charm worked on me. \"Well except for leaving me.\" Now, I think I want a hug. Right on cue - as if he read my mind - Freddie engulfed me into a big hug. I thrust my head in between his neck and shoulder while his head was buried in my hair just inhaling my scent. This felt - right. End of Chapter 25. If I do believe? :) Going by quite fast. And I still have sooo much I wanna do and say! Gosh. Well ideas are lovely if you guys have them. Thanks for reading! Em[Chapter 26] Andrew \"Damnit Kate where is she?!\" My intense yelling that I have been doing for the past hour doesn't seem to be doing much. Poppy won't freakin answer her phone! And it's for the stupidest reason that I lost her at the water park. Drippy attacked me and kissed me all in one motion, and I assume that Poppy saw. But it makes no sense still. She doesn't think I like Drippy, and she thinks that I have a girlfriend back in Cali. \"Relax Drew. When she's ready, she'll call. Just give her some time. I'm sure she's fine!\" Stupid sister no help. I stormed off to my room with emotions running wild. I felt a good song coming from this whole day. I wonder how Freddie is feeling? What the HELL am I saying? Why do I give a shit about his feelings? I haven't felt this close to a girl since I met Lisa. I remember that song I wrote for her... I never quite sang it to her though. Poppy's face kept coming up in my mind. I didn't think that I could love her so soon, but these feelings I have are so stron I almost can't describe it using words. That kiss we had... Meant so so so much to me. But it's not just about the physical stuff, we could talk for hours on end and I swear I wouldn't get bored. She's so intelligent and compelling. It's the easiest thing to talk to her! Her eyes swelled with a mixture of emotions as I watched the faintest bit of tears appear on her face. It only made me want to reach out and fix it for her. Just to help in some way. I reached out and placed my hand upon her cheek. I traced my fingers on the dimples that formed on her face from the smile after my touch. Her skin so soft with the faintest smell of velvet and grape. My mouth watered as I looked at her lips. I learned down and placed my mouth on hers only slightly open with my tongue lingering on my lower lip. I didn't want to move to fast by forcing my tongue in her mouth, so I kept it just lingering on my lips. Her own mouth was so smooth and sweet tasting it made me love this moment more. As the kiss deepened I felt myself placing my hand on her hip as she placed her arms around my neck and hand on my cheek. Our lips moved perfectly in sync it almost made me shake with realization of how amazing this was. She smiled through the kiss which only made me love it more. And realize how much she was enjoying this too. My heart was- \"Drew come help me with dinner. And you should put your guitar down if you aren't going to even play it,\" the obnoxious voice echoed through my ears ruining my memorable thoughts. Damnit Kate, be nosier? \"Mmm,\" I mumbled back in annoyance. Oh Poppy please come back... **** Poppy We've been reconnecting with eachother for over an hour now, practically connected at the hip! I never thought I would forgive him. Especially not like this, but he was there for me in a time of need. Except I'm not really quite sure what I am in need of really. \"What time do you think it would be exceptable for getting home? It's kind of 10 til midnight Trouble. And I'm not sure Kate or her mother would be too happy with you getting in past midnight.\" Ah shit! I totally lost track of time! \"Um can you take me back then?\" But I didn't want to go. I wanted to stay with him. Maybe I could call in and tell them I'm staying at a friends? Or no they would know it's Freddie wouldn't they. \"Yeah let's go,\" And the ride begin. It was really short. All I could remember was the look on Andrew's and Freddie's face when we pulled into the driveway of Kate's house with Andrew standing right there. On the doorstep. Looking at me. **** I've never been in a more awkward position in my life. 2 guys I have feelings for, looking at eachother with me in the middle of it. But it all started when I kissed Freddie's cheek thank you and goodnight, before I left the car. Then I walked up to Andrew and he took me by the waist, which I immediately shook off. I only just then watched his face of confusion grow, and Ffreddie's face blossom with annoyance. He looked as if he was about to get out of the car and come to me. As if I needed saving from Andrew! But they did have a bumpy past... \"Where did you go?\" Andrew's voice broke through my thoughts. I strangely didn't want to answer him. Not with the night I just had with Freddie. I only wanted to go to sleep, and get ready for my lunch date I''ll be having tomorrow with Freddie. Well, I want to prepare mentally for the date. If only Andrew would allow that, eh? Or possibly one of the girls will annoy me with questions. Somehow this night seemed to be lasting longer than I wanted. \"I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Bye.\" Humf. Telling him off seemed easier than I thought it would be. He was shocked too at my disagreement. My voice was strong in the sense I had clear confidence within it. Andrew's eyes were big. I felt guilty in the sense that I'd be ignoring him without much of an explanation. But hey, I need some time for myself, and I would like it now. And if the means I can't talk to him for a while, then that's whats going to happen. If that's too much for him to handle, maybe he should go back to school early or something. Might help him a little, and also let him see his girlfriend sooner. Win win situation for him, right? Get me out of the way without much thought, and get to see his girlfriend sooner. Lovely eh? \"Can we please talk Poppy?\" No. That's my final answer. My mind says no! Hell no I don't want to talk to you! The imbecile who won my heart over so damn fast and then crushed it without second thought. Using me to fit his male needs. And he knew how emotionally unstable I was! Freddie really is the best for me, and that was definately reassured tonight. It's a good thing that Drippy and him kissed. Because in result it made me leave and find Freddie. \"Okay,\" apparently my heart has other plans for me. Love stinks. If that's what you can call it anyways. Alright. This one was a bit of a toughy to write for me. One because I had a headache which destroyed me! - while I wrote it. And 2, because I got beat up by a girl on a soccer team I played which made me really mad and depressed. She fractured a bone on my body, let me scarred, and happened to ram me into the wall (its indoor) that I have bruises that probably cover at least half of my body. Yeah, so I have had a rough day, yet I decided to write this. Sorry if it sucks. At least you know why.... Em - AkA chik who wants to beat the ass of #2 on the revolution so bad she's going to need surgery to redo her messed up face.[Chapter 27] Poppy \"Mmm No!\" Kate has been trying to get me up so we can go take Kiki to her favorite restaurant for her birthday this morning and then take her shopping. Did they ever stop to think that maybe since I got back at past midnight, that I might be tired? Just maybe!? Come on guys be more intelligent. Or at least use your common sense! \"Poppy stop being so self centered! It's her birthday now you need to get your ass the hell up!\" I dunno if there is some bad blood between me and her since her brother is getting the cold shoulder from me, OR its because I got back really late last night without even calling to say where I was. But I thought that Freddie texted her? Hmm maybe he did and that's why she's mad at me. Cause I was with Freddie! Am I giving in too easily to him? That's probably the case right now, but I didn't feel like anything was wrong about last night. In fact it felt like old times, and he made me feel a million times better. \"Just chill. I'll be right down, okay?\" I slowly started shoving the covers off of me and heading towards the bathroom. Kate left the room to my great pleasure. Why is everybody so damn crabby now a days? \"Hey can we talk please?\" Oh look the exact person I want to talk to. I wonder if you can sound sarcastic in your thoughts? Cause hell I've never been more annoyed about seeing Andrew in front of me ever. Yay. \"I'll be right down and maybe we can talk then, cya.\" I turned and walked into the bathroom with my fresh clothes in hand. \"Come on please? I want to know what happened last night! Why'd you leave?\" Idiot banged on the bathroom door which made me jump back and bang into the bathtub with my knee. OW! Well he already knows very well what happened last night, and why I left. Should I tell him though? \"I felt like a third wheel on yours and Drip's date. Plus, you guys were snogging and I didn't wanna get in the way of that. So if that's all, then I'll see you downstairs.\" Maybe I wasn't completely being honest, but then again I was totally lying either! So I have done nothing wrong. Yeah. Exactly. \"Oh. But it wasn't a date Poppy! She was all loopy and kissed me. I swear I didn't kiss her, nor did I want to.\" The words made my heart tingle. But in the end all I felt was ache. I also really hope that Drip didn't hear that, or she'll be crushed beyond repair! Ahh I shouldn't be getting involved with him. \"I don't care whether you wanted to or not, I still felt left out. And anyways, I ran into Freddie so I was fine.\" Sorta. \"Yeah I saw that. Hm, tell me. I thought you were upset at him? But I guess you guys worked everything out and are good now? Yes?\" His voice pressed into me and I felt like I was getting interviewed by Fox for witnessing some crime. His interest in Freddie seemed peculiar, and also totally NOT his business at all. \"Why do you care? And even if we didn't work things through, he was still there for me when I needed him last night!\" I practically yelled at him through the door as I finished up with my last makeup and hair issues. Then I stepped out and walked past his tall muscular body towards the closet which held my favorite purple roxy jacket. \"Of course I care! It's about you! Oh and yeah yeah sure he was there. Well I AM here and should always be. Plus I didn't leave you when you were broken like that. I was there and listened to everything you had to say. How can you even think that I don't care or that I don't want to help you not get hurt again? I swear Poppy, when I kissed you yes? - Well did that have any meaning to you? Cause it sure as hell had a lot of meaning to me.\" His expressed weakened and dropped to a paler side. His eyes sparkled with a twinge of water hitting the bottoms of his eyes. My body stood motionless in front of his own hurt one. Yes I like that he cares about me, and I am glad that he wants to keep being there for me. But I really need to work out my issues with um, Freddie, because I love him? Humf. Looking at Andrew with his sad eyes made me have to re-think that statement about Freddie. These things I feel for Andrew are just so... unexpected? Strong? \"I'm sorry for leaving and not coming to you, but we did need to work things out. We are good, and I hope that you and Me are too. Really. You're great Drew, and um... That kiss was...\" Spectacular? Hot? Mouth watering? Made me feel like I was in heaven and hell at the same time? So sweet yet so fiery and burning with desire? My pulse rising and clearly found all over my body... His warm arms around my body, the chills his lips gave me the moment we connected, and my urge to keep going despite all my better instincts. Yeah, this might have been the best. \"That kiss... Poppy Please.\" I closed my eyes feeling them getting weaker and weaker, which was so unlike them! They ached with stiffness and moisture. \"You have no idea what effect that had on me. Yeah, I've only known you for a few weeks, but every moment I am with you it feels like I've known you my whole life! And kissing you just made it... Okay, I'm not explaining this right.\" His eyes rolled in an anxious way before he grabbed a hold of my hand and pulled me down onto the bed with him. Our faces were a mere 4 inches apart. I felt his sweet smelling breath and cologne fill my nostrils. I leaned closer in result so - it's about 3 inches now. \"I didn't want to pull away. This kiss was so natural and soft– we weren't even digging down each others throats – yet I felt the sparks tingle all throughout my body, jolting me. I knew that you felt something there too the moment your own hands were placed on my cheeks for support, and it only made me want more! The feelings I get with you will always be a hundred times greater than anything else I've ever felt with another girl before. You were just so... Special? You know?\" I couldn't move. My body went limp. Everything he said sounded so sincere, honest and true! I can't bear this another second! There is no way in hell that I can do this. Especially not right after I got things straightened out with Freddie! But that kiss... I felt the heart rise and fall every moment my breath paced to a quicker tempo at his lips touch. The timing and way our lips and bodies fit together was just so perfect - so natural. \"Andrew. I really don't know if now is the time?\" I looked down only to see him grab my other hand and start stroking it with his thumb. \"I just wanted you to know,\" his hulky man voice said. Haha, when guys have a low voice and they speak softly it makes it sound lower! Anyways, I need a plan for this little situation I am in. Oh shit, I have school next week! What the hell am I going to do? Senior in high school, boyfriend who is so bipolar it's like a chik PMS-ing 24/7, and a guy who I have really strong feelings for but is going back to college on Thursday? Which is in 5 days? I really need an idea. \"Oh for crying out loud Poppy could you take any longe-\" Josie marched into my room only to see Andrew holding my hands on my bed. Her lips curled into the faintest smile I saw, but once Andrew looked up too, it disapeared. Yes I bet she sees the issue I have here too! With all my, friends that I have all together. \"Right sorry, I just needed some help with something. Yeah uh, be right there,\" I stood up letting my arms fall lamely to my sides. Andrew stood up too embracing me in a hug immediately. Although at first I was opposed to it, I gently let my guard down and hugged back. His body was so warm and strong, which made me feel safer than ever in his arms. \"Come on. As much as I would love - I mean really I would love - if we could do this all day sometime. But right now it is kinda your buds birthday. May I escort you? Or are you still in need to telling me what happened last night with your boy toy before I help you down the stairs?\" This seemed like an indirect approach of dissing Freddie. In some ways I was annoyed. In others, hey it's funny and I could care less. Um, only in some ways of course. I just want you to know. That I've been fighting to let you go. Some days I make it through. But then there's nights that never end. BAM! 27 es finished!.... :) NEwaysssss... I am really tired. And sick. So I am currently going through my baby (iPOD) therapy at the moment so I should be getting better. Hopefully good enough to post an even LONGER eppy. Or chapter. Whatever its called on this thing :) I am so out of it! Em 3 p.s. I love questions. Or comments. & Reviews are pretty cool too!![Chapter 28] Freddie I watched Poppy exit my car with her graceful body just flowing with the wind. Her body had tensed when she saw who was standing on the porch looking intensly at my car. He spoke aloud but I did not hear it. All I know is that Poppy didn't really like it seeing as she barely spoke after a glance at me and walked past him into the door. I couldn't help but smile seeing him get rejected like that, but of course the feeling faded when I realized my night with Poppy was over. And he will get to see her for the rest of the night, and possibly the morning too! Well, that's only up until our lunch date. If you could call it a date of course, because honestly I'm not quite sure Poppy has fully forgiven me. Yes, she kissed me back and let me explain everything to her, but that doesn't always mean that one is forgiven. I always thought I knew Poppy well enough to read her. Except I did find out that Poppy has a lot of ways she shows her emotions, and all those who have seen her longer than an hour get to know her just by her facial reactions. I always loved that about her. It made her seem vulnerable though, like I had to protect her always. Plus she seemed smaller than most and thinner, which made me feel like I needed to protect her even more. To me, it felt as if every second without Poppy was an hour. It felt as if every day without her felt like a decade. My life was becoming more and more messed up, and I couldn't do a thing about it. I never should have left her because of that raw feeling of remorse and annoyance towards her. Ellie is and always will be wrong about my Poppy. Now I just need to think of a way for her to completely forgive me. And I knew that was going to be a tough job. \"Hey mum. Long night, I'll be off to bed.\" I tried sneaking by without getting caught, but of course she was wide awake making arrangements for her precious school she'll be running again in the fall. \"Why were you out so late?\" Of course there was literally no way of getting by without that question. Bending the truth is probably the most genius idea ever. \"Helping out a friend in need, you know? They were having some issues, then I got lost on my way driving them home so it took much longer than expected. I'm sorry mom, but I'll call next time.\" Ah damn I was getting it done so well. \"Next time? I hope not. But if it's for a friend, then I guess it's alright,\" Yeah cause friends are more important than that one night I was at a party huh? \"Especially not when school starts up again next week. Your curfew will be very strict.\" There's no need for me to be out and about unless it's to be looking for Poppy at her school, or to be out getting something for Poppy. Because she always needs her 2am snack! Her favorite is java chip ice cream from starbucks, but that seems to be a bit harder to find around here than in L.A. I noticed how Soph took me into a lot of stores, and almost everyone that had food, had a starbucks nearby or inside the building. It was fascinating on how much these people loved their starbucks. Back her in England there's tons of coffee places and they are much cheaper than starbucks, or you could just make your coffee at home. \"Yes Mum this should be the last time. But just in case, I promise to call okay. Night.\" I trudged up the stairs after a warning that I needed to clean up my clothes and do my laundry or else. Whatever the hell 'or else' means to parents these days. I guess I could always find out, right? I plopped down onto my pillow with all my clothes on - except for my shoes which I had slipped off at the door - and stared up at the ceiling. Trouble's face kept appearing in my mind, and as I drifted into unconsciousness I felt the smile on my face remain. Poppy \"I'm walkin on sunshine.. Ooh oh! And don't it feel good, HEY! Alright now, and don't it feel good! Hey!\" I have been dancing around my room blasting my ipod for the past 20 minutes. Just got home from Kiki's little birthday party and man am I dead! Kate made me play all the games at the arcade, and ride all the rides at the amusement park. Trust me when I say all of the rides. But even though I was dead from earlier today, I felt like singing. Back at home it always calmed me down when I was annoyed at someone or just frustrated. I used to sing all the time instead of just when I was dealing with crap. But that changed a while ago ever since... \"How long have you been singing for!?\" Drippy came in looking disgusting. Her face very pale as if she just puked 20 times and decided to come in my room. Maybe I should get her a bucket before she pukes all over my stuff. \"Just like half an hour. Probably less! Come on Drip, live a little?\" I turned back to my ipod scanning through my songs looking for the perfect one that I could dance to. Ah yes! Kevin Rudolf. I do believe he da man! \"Ugh fine bye.\" Drippy left just as I was making sure the stereo was still working propperly. Kevin Rudolf's voice boomed throughout my room. The moment I heard the bass I felt my hips swaying to the beats and guitar chords which seemed to be in perfect sync. She working it all about She moves it around the clock And she can get it Sh-sh-She can get it Pop! My head bangs as my hips sink low and shimmy from down the floor to the air. Don't quit The way that she moves it She's making me lose my grip And she can get it Sh-sh-she can g-g-get it My hair flowed freely as my arms were swaying to the beat and my legs just moving in sync with the backbeats of the song. \"You ever considered Julliard Miss? Not only can you sing,\" I turned my head to find the source of the voice that interupted me while I was so focused on my jam session. \"But you can dance too.\" Andrew of course appeared in my door and I watched him lean against the door frame. \"Hmm. No not really, it's just a hobby. Thanks.\" I walked over and turned the stereo which was still booming with 'the mans' voice. I still felt the tones in my mind which made my body sway the slightest instictively. I just couldn't actually control myself when I felt the beat take over. \"You should consider it though. You're real good. Now, can we talk?\" Ah yes I forgot! I am supposed to talk to him... Hm maybe I can stall a little longer? \"I'm sort of exhausted now,\" and that wasn't a complete lie. But it also wasn't the complete truth either. Hey I'm a teenager, live a little? \"Oh. Um, well then we can talk in the morning tomorrow if you'd prefur? But Poppy I really hope you aren't ignoring me,\" he stepped closer to my sweating hot body and stretched out his arms towards mine. \"Because there's no reason to be ignoring me.\" Oh how he is so wrong. There are many reasons as to why I should not be necessarily getting involved with him at the moment, or soon in the future for that matter. Plus, he totally still has a girlfriend? Or maybe I completely misinterpreted that and he never had one in the first place. I guess I'll only find that out if I talk to him. \"Okay. And I'm uh, I-I'm not ignoring you. I swear.\" Damn I felt my arms shake while in his and he looked at me straight in the eyes. Why am I so easy when it comes to reading me!? I really don't like this trait that I've seemed to enharit from my dad. I wonder if Molly has it too? \"Let's talk now then.\" I pulled him down onto the bed beside me. Not until then did I realize just how sweaty and stinky I was, and quickly covered my noise in realization. Andrew laughed at my motion and let go of my hands. \"You can shower. I'll wait okay?\" I wonder why it always seems that he is waiting for me when I get out of the shower. Not that I minded that much assuming that he likes the idea of me in only a towel. Shit what am I saying! I need to calm down. Wow, sugar does such things to me… End of chapter 28 peoples!!! Ahh. Humf. I already wrote the entire sequel to this Niley story that I have. Which is annoying because like I am writing this, and another one, but i seriously dunno if I should post it because some people like this more than Niley. I still love niley though!! :) And Liam+Miley is adorable. I'm a HUGE nicholas sparks fan as i said before in my pro so I loovvvee The Last Song. very very very much. Em 3 She can get sh-sh-she can g-g-get it. :)[Chapter 29] Poppy So last night Andrew and I had a lovely conversation. Alright well maybe it wasn't that lovely, but I did actually tell him everything that happened with Freddie. Which was probably a bad idea, because I only saw pained expressions in his features as I spoke every word about the moment I had. It hurt me telling him, but I felt like he should know everything. Even if it hurt. But of course, the truth hurts – right? I groggily got up from bed heading towards the bathroom smelling my own morning breath – which was awful! Hence I need a toothbrush. I opened the door and got in realizing what I was wearing. It was a pair of boxers and a really big t-shirt. It wasn't mine, and I don't even remember putting this stuff on. And why did this bathroom look so familiar, yet had none of my stuff in it? Come to think of it, I don't really remember what happened after I told Andrew about my meeting with Freddie. This thought worried me the slightest as I touched the shirt I was wearing which had a familiar scent to it. \"Oh no..\" I spoke as I gasped and looked up at myself in the mirror. Shit. *** Andrew So last night, I was dreaming about this girl right. She has beautiful eyes, a gorgeous smile, and a goofy laugh that makes my body go numb - literally music to my ears. But last night, she kissed me like I have never been kissed before. Her name is Poppy, and I swear I wasn't dreaming. I smiled remembering what happened. It quickly faded though after the thought of what she had done earlier that day with a boy I despised. \"Would you stop zoning out on me all the time Drew? I mean come on get a grip,\" My annoying sister rambled on. I was on the couch watching the Manchester United game while Kate tried talking to me about the conversation she had with her boyfriend last night. Why does she think I want to listen to her going all lovey dovey shit with her boyfriend? Yeah if he crosses the line I'll kick his ass, but why do I need to know about this crap? Eh? Tell me please! \"Sorry. Game on. Bye.\" I mumbled keeping my eyes locked on the game. I heard someone shuffle down the stairs and I turned hoping it was Poppy. Nope, just Drippy. I quickly turned back around hoping she didn't approach me again. Though I doubted she would seeing as I completely told her off the other day at the water park. But I swear I turned her down in a very gentlemen like way! Even if she did sort of smack me really hard and start crying and placing herself into my arms once again. Which really made no sense at all! Girls are confusing though, so I guess it is to be expected that they do weird things. \"Hey would you go upstairs and get Poppy down here? I really got to ask her something about last night,\" Oh great. I wonder what she has to ask her about eh? \"Yeah sure.\" I hobbled off the couch and headed for the staircase slowly increasing my pace feeling myself get nervous. I wonder if she remembers what happened last night... \"Ow!\" I heard yelling from the bathroom and ran to the door to hear Poppy inside crying. \"Are you okay? Can I come in?\" I asked hoping she'd say yes so I could help her out with whatever was going on. \"Um, I slipped and my leg is b-b-bleeding a-and it h-hurt-s.\" I slowly opened the door to see her on the ground wrapped in only a towel. This reminded me of the time where Lisa got hurt in a soccer game and I had to go help her out with her injuries right after she showered. I even helped her stand up occasionally while she showered, but in a brotherly way. I never looked, and nor did I intend to. I am not an ass, and girls like their privacy kept private unless you've been let in. Poppy probably isn't too comfortable with this, but I need to show her that she can trust me with this. Even if she looks so hot while wet and wrapped in such little clothing. You could she a fraction of her boob sticking slighty out from the top of the towel, but no more than it would if she was wearing a normal tank top. \" Well we need to stop the bleeding so lemme just see if Kate...\" I stopped thinking out loud and reached into the cabinet pulling out the first-aid kit and sitting down next to her on the tile floor. Her back was leaning slightly against the bath tub and her leg that was bleeding was revealed from out under her towel and stretched out towards me. I took some gauze and began to clean the wound hoping it wasn't stinging too much. I know I can handle the pain, and Lisa could, but for Poppy I wasn't as sure. \"Ow... Mmm..\" She mumbled a few words and closed her eyes shutting them tightly and clenching her hand into a fist. \"Almost done cleaning, okay?\" I said as I finished up with cleaning all the blood away from the floor and her leg, then moving on to make sure it was clean all around the massive cut before I bandaged it up. The cut ran all up along her left shin. I looked up at her to see her eyes closed still, but a smile on her face as I glided my hands all around her leg - which was extremely smooth and soft - which I loved. \"Here we go,\" I bandaged up her leg and watched her slowly open her eyes and look at me. She smiled weakly and grimaced at the sudden movement to get up she had attempted. \"Come on lemme help,\" I stood up and wrapped my arm around her back helping her out of the bathroom. I'm so glad that we are in MY room, and I had decided to shut the door to my room before I came in to help Poppy. \"Can I have my clothes?\" She whispered out as I helped her over to the bed. Oh shit, her clothes are all bloody from the fall... Uhh... Kate might get suspicious... \"Here just take mine okay? They'll probably feel better anyways because they are bigger and more comfortable,\" I smirked at the last part but then threw my shirt over my head and handed it over to her. She took it and slipped it over her own head - with my help - and over the towel as well. I grabbed some boxer shorts from my drawer and gave those to her also. I noticed how she looked really tired, so I helped her slip those on too under her towel. I didn't see anything, well except her flinch when the button from the boxers briefly scratched over her wound from moments ago. \"Thanks,\" She said and fell back on my bed after throwing the towel on the floor. I picked it up and brought it back into my bathroom hanging it up. Then I walked back out to see her lying down on my bed sleeping. I smiled and headed over to her, lightly and gently picking her up then placing her under the blankets. I climbed in myself just stroking her hair in hopes that it would straighten it out and that she wouldn't be too upset that it'd look kind of messy in the morning. I remember all those nights where Lisa was embarassed after she had wet hair and fell asleep before washing it. She was mortified, but luckily I was there to helpp her out. It didn't look all that bad, and girls really shouldn't stress over those things. She still looked like her normal beautiful self. Just with a tad bit of a wacky hairdo. \"Wow,\" I heard Poppy say through the door of my room. Wow was right, and hopefully she doesn't get too mad at what happened. I did let her sleep in my bed, and I slept on the floor leaving her there. Well after I stroked her hair for abou 3 hours. Maybe I'm the one who made it messed up? \"Poppy?\" I asked as I walked into my room smiling like an idiot. Man I love her. OH MY!! :) Em[Chapter 30] Poppy \"Poppy I know I showed you all those English Parody bands but seriously, this needs to stop! You won't freaking shut if off!\" Kate yelled trying to drown out the sound of my music playing. It was a parody of the song Tik Tok by Ke$ha. I never quite liked her, but I did like the beats and back track a lot. Wake up in the morning feelin like Winehouse Grab my breezers I'm out the door I'm gonna be REALLY LOUD Cuz I dont care who I piss off yeah Im a real big sinner Sometimes I eat my dessert before my dinner Talking odd socks on my toes, toes Taking off all my clothes, clothes Feeling overexposed, So I put back all of my clothes back on Flush before I wee, wee Get arrested daily, ly Trying to get a peak of some titties Im mad, really bad But dont tell my mum & dad Pucker up kiss my but Cuz Im bloody fucking nuts Hear the bass, skinny waist Now lets copy pokerface like.... whoa wa oh-oh-oh whoa oh-oh \"I'm mad really bad, but don't tell my mum and dad! Pucker up kiss my butt cause I'm bloody fuckin nuts, hear the bass, skinny waist. Now let's copy pokerface like ...\" As I began 'woahing' i saw Kate leaving the room. Aww, I guess she doesn't like my singing! I smirked and continued with the profanity that began in the bridges of the song. I laughed so hard I nearly fell over after the song ended. \"Again, you should try out for broadway or something Miss Moore,\" Andrew said while leaning against my door. \"How come you always walk in on me singing? Is it on purpose?\" \"No I guess I'm just lucky,\" his soft monotone replied. \"Yeah..\" I scoffed. \"Lucky.\" \"So are you all better from your fall 2 days ago?\" Andrew questioned. Yesterday I had woken up in his clothes and feeling really sore, which of course led me to believe that I had done it with him the night before. Then he came in the room startling me as I was trying to remember what happened. After he explained to me what really happened - and thank God it wasn't what I thought - we spent the whole day just talking. \"Uh yeah thanks. I think I'm okay now, just that really big bruise from where the massive cut was. I can't believe I got so cut up and bruised from just falling and accidentally hitting something in the bathroom.\" I said. Come to think of it, I'm not even quite sure what I had hit to make me get all cut up and bleed. \"That's good. Want to go have breakfast? Cause um... Well you guys are going back to school soon so I was just wondering if you wanted to spend some time together before you leave.\" Andrew asked shyly. He never came across as shy before. It was always confident and prepared for him, so this lapse of normal behavior was odd. \"I'd love to, lemme just change..\" I looked down to see my in my silk pink night gown. The dress was pretty low cut, and didn't go anywhere near my knees. This made me self conscience of how I looked just now dancing around, and probably showing off more skin that I would if I were in a bathing suit. \"Sure, I'll wait downstairs.\" Drew said as he started leaving. I hurried off into the bathroom while grabbing a pair of jeans, v-neck shirt, and a bomber jacket. I've had my dreams about being with Andrew at his college, at least 6 times since the first night. I just can't seem to stop feeling this way towards him, and wanting it all to happen so fast! But dreams only come true if you make them, and hell! - I wasn't sure if I was ready for that. I wonder what Freddie is doing... *** Freddie Only 3 more days until Poppy goes back to school, and I can see her again. I hope she really has forgiven me, and that she wants to see me. Maybe we could secretly date once again! Mum would never know, and since my school doesn't start up at the same time hers does, I could stay at the school for a long time. Just rebuilding our relationship again, to what it once was. \"Freddie! Come, we are going to Abbey Mount. I need to prepare with all the teachers. So you might want to get all your things now or else you'll be coming back here on your own to get your things. And I doubt your car could hold all your belongings. \"Of course Mother. I'll be quick though, because I left a lot at Abbey Mount already.\" She nodded. \"Alright, I'll wait downstairs. Please hurry I don't have that long to prepare for the next semester.\" And with that she headed down the stairs. I turned and looked at my room searching for the thing I would need to most to get me through the next 3 days. My picture of Poppy and I on our first date. And her beautiful brunette hair flowing down her shoulders while her arms wrap around my neck. \"I love you Trouble...\" I whispered in the air. And this time, I knew - in my heart for sure - that I truly loved this girl. Nobody would stop me from getting her this time. Nothing, and no one. I kissed the picture while grabbing my suitcase - which I had packed the night before since I'd been expecting this departure from my house for a while now - and headed out my door. \"Alright mum, I'm ready.\" Can't wait to see you Poppy... *** Poppy \"So where we going?\" I asked Andrew who was leading me out the door and into his car. \"No place special just going for some breakfast, and then I want to show you something.\" Andrew said as he opened the passenger door and motioned for her to climb in. \"Alright, well where are you showing me after?\" I wonder if its another soccer game! That would be so much fun, and then maybe I could meet him coach. And totally be recruited for the Stanford soccer team. Since I'm a junior, they'd let me go a year early. Plus I'd get placed in Andrew's dorm... Wow. I smiled at the thoughts. \"Surprise,\" he said and started driving into town. \"Fine whatever you want,\" I mumbled and looked out the window attempting to get lost in my thoughts again. Except the only thing I could come to were questions. Was Andrew going to want to talk to me when I go back to school? Would Freddie want to talk to me knowing that I am talking with Andrew? What about my feelings for Andrew - do they mean anything? \"Hey you okay?\" he asked looking over at me. I then realized that he was holding my hand. What would Freddie say? \"Uh yeah,\" I looked up to him. \"Andrew what are we doing?\" Finally the royal question was out. \"What do you mean?\" He answered in a question. Such a guy! \"I'm taking you to breakfast?\" Wow 2 questions. That might be a record. \"I meant with you and me,\" hopefully that's a good way to propose the question. If not, this is going to be really embarrassing. \"Ah,\" he started. This is good though because it means he understands! \"Well I like you a lot, but we are kinda going to be on opposite sides of the world for the next 4 months or so. I'd love to still talk though?\" I'm not quite sure how I felt about this, but at least I wasn't crying like I was when Freddie had left me last year. Maybe that means I don't have to same feelings for Andrew as Freddie. Gosh I'm so bipolar! I can't freakin' make up my goddamned mind! \"That's good. I want to talk,\" I said respectfully - which is so unlike the Poppy Moore I have known for the last 3 years - and squeezed his hand tightly. \"I'm going to miss our talks. And our late night 'I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing' sessions. Oh and also you walking in on me whenever I am doing something embarrassing. That's definitely going to be missed most!\" I laughed at my own statement and heard him join in seconds later. Hey, I really am going to miss this. \"Alright Miss Moore, we are here.\" I looked out the window once more as I felt the car stop and his hand slipping away from mine. I didn't recognize the name at all, and the sign was too small for me to read. Well small family restaurants are always good! Andrew came around to open my door and stuck out his hand ducking down ever so slightly. [My Prince] \"Cute,\" I whispered while taking his hand to let him help me out of the truck. \"They have the best waffles in the world. No joke,\" he said. I had shut the door and we were holding hands towards the door. Was this friends holding hands - or maybe more? Goodness! Mixed signals are so damn stupid! Why can't guys be straightforward? \"You sure? Better than IHOP?\" \"Oh please this place makes IHOP look like a middle school cafeteria!\" I love IHOP.... \"We'll see,\" I whispered. \"Yes we will,\" apparently he heard me. I scoffed and waited for us to be taken to our seats. Then a pretty dirty blonde - tall - women came up to us with menus. She reminded me of Sophie. I bet Freddie would be drooling over her right now. And that makes me thankful that I'm with Andrew this fine morning instead of that two-timing son of a bitch. Whoops, excuse my french. \"Hey thanks,\" Andrew said taking the menus from the waitress and handing one to me. We were sitting in a booth across from each other, and luckily from my seat I could see out the window. Another gorgeous view of mountains and hills. It's mind boggling how angelic Europe as a whole is. \"It's so magnificent outside. I swear when I move back to L.A. after this year, I am going to visit this place every summer.\" I truly have been dazzled by the views. When I first came here with my stuck up bitchy attitude, I hated the stupid grass and hills more than anything! - well except for my dad who sent me out here. But now, it only made me like this place more. Such an Abbey Mount girl now, eh? \"Yeah, it's always a site to see,\" Andrew said looking at me with bright eyes. The waitress came up to us with the same look in her eyes staring at Andrew - who didn't seem fazed at all. \"Can I start you two off with something to drink?\" The blondie asked. I looked at Andrew - who still hadn't looked up at the pretty girl staring at him - so I ordered first from his lack of response. \"Yeah, I'll have some hot cocoa please.\" I nodded at her while she wrote it down. I'm not quite sure why, but that has always been a habit of mine to do. I looked to Andrew who again was still looking at me. I feel like Bella Swan getting the looks of love from Edward Cullen - not that I minded that anyways. But finally Andrew said something. \"I'll have water. And we know what we want. 2 orders of the double waffle, thanks.\" Andrew handed her my menu and his while she continued to write down everything he said. Such odd attitude from this boy this morning. I like it. Okay sorry that I said this would be the end of the story, but I was just away from my laptop so I didn't have any time to write at all! But hopefully I will be able to write some more. I'm away at a soccer tourney in a different state, and will be there for the next week - so in result I probably won't be able to post much at all. But I'll check for everywhere to see if my ipod gets wifi. Or possibly if my phone can post it (which I'm still testing out) . Sorry for the inconvenience. Well, I'm definitely not ending the story right here. Maybe at chapter 35 or something. But then I'm gonna start on the sequel (if you guys want?) right after. Thanks, (: Em[Chapter 31] Poppy So here I am caught in a storm of 'hellos' and 'i missed you!' all around me. Being at Abbey Mount again gave me that hope of feeling whole - and feeling complete again. \"Hey Mom,\" I whispered into the empty air. I turned around at the sound of a scream, and there standing in front of me was a girl near my dorm from last year - Callie - who had thanked me immensly for getting rid of Harriet. But of course I wasn't the only one. I smirked remembering the great memory, and approached Callie with an open mind. \"Hey there girl!\" She yelped. She was honestly the only person in England who has called me 'girl' this entire time I've been here. It's kinda funny, but I'm not quite sure what to think of it. \"Hey you,\" I laughed as she side hugged me before moving on to where Drippy, Kiki and Josie stood. Kate must still be at her car saying bye to her parents... And Andrew... \"Hello Miss Moore,\" a deep voice said making me turn around to only be caught up in his arms. I seemed to fit perfectly in them, which made this position I was in seem very much so less awkward. \"Yo Andrew,\" I mumbled. He laughed, kissed my cheek and set me down. I felt my cheeks swell up and eventually smile at him. \"I'm going to miss you there Buddy. Who am I going to talk to?\" Which was true. Andrew is always a good listener to my problems, and he's amazing at helping me out with them. Plus, who's going to be there to sing to me late at night? My lousy old ipod - that I love so much - that doesn't have the angelic voice Andrew has? \"I'm gonna miss you too Poppy. We can still talk, and you know you have Kate here.\" He mumbled while coming closer to me. I didn't oblige, because I knew that I'd miss the closeness of our bodies. The sparks - or whatever you want to call it - was clearly noticeable from our positions once we came close enough to each other. I gulped feeling my body tense as his body moved forward and closer to mine by about a foot. Slowly I felt every thing else fade away into nothing, so it seemed as though it was only Andrew and I left. \"Can I kiss you? Or would that embarrass you beyond belief?\" His voice sounding soft against the deep breathing my body was producing into the chilly air. His hands came up to my face and slid down, then around my neck slightly. I felt my eyes closing feeling more and more pleasure - and comfort - from his warm strong hands caressing my neck and jawbone. \"Mhm,\" I nodded and opened my eyes slowly. He embraced me in a hug which took me by surprise, but moments later I finally wrapped my arms tightly around his waist also. I felt comfortable in this position, and hoped - no prayed - that he wouldn't let me go too quickly. But anytime other than never seemed like too soon. I breathed in his sweet cologne which I had become so attuned and addicted to over the past weeks. I felt myself groan. I knew in a split second the time of space was coming, but it was none the less still dreaded much. \"Now,\" he chuckled and leaned down towards my face. Me being, well me , closed the gap sooner than expected. His lips moved in sync with mine - with not much effort I might add - as I felt his big arms wrap around my waist and pick me up. I felt myself jumping and wrapping my own legs around his torso while placing my small arms around his neck. Our occasion was broken in record time by someone coming over and touching me. I felt Andrew slowly put me down and knew our last minutes together were approaching and at a rapid pace. \"Hey we need to start getting inside,\" Kate said almost whispering and looking around at the almost empty courtyard where we were standing. It was just Andrew, Kate, Me, and Kate's car left. Wow crowd clears fast! \"Oh, so I guess this is goodbye?\" I looked to Andrew one last time memorizing his face as best as I could. Then I hugged him one last time before walking in with Kate towards the doors. \"Bye Moore!\" Andrew yelled with a sheepish smile plastered on his face. I felt myself swing around and blow him a kiss. Man I'm the weirdest girl on the planet. \"Haha you guys are funny!\" Kate exclaimed while taking my hand and leading me up the oh so familar stair case that leads to the dining hall. \"Sorry! I'm just so in lovveee,\" I joked with her. Kate looked at me with serious eyes and I widened mine in response. \"No No No Kate! I don't love him. Well I mean I guess I do, but I'm not in love with him.\" Or at least I haven't thought about that thoroughly yet. Not with Andrew anyway. I had with Freddie once but -- oh no. Reality hits me now, Freddie. He's here! He's always here before the start of the term! What if he saw me and Andrew?! He's probably pissed! \"Oh no shit! Kate, what about Freddie!?\" I nearly yelled now suddenly becoming the force pulling both Kate and myself up the stairs. She looked at me with wide eyes realizing exactly what I was thinking, but then her expression turned confused as she continued to follow me up the steps. \"I thought you hated him for leaving and such?\" She asked. I guess I never quite told her what happened... Then we walked into the door, or more like stumbled into the door to see those pair of eyes piercing into my skin. I bet I'm scarred for life from the looks I was getting right now. Kiki jumped up so we would see her and go to where she saved us seats. Unfortunately we walked right by Freddie's table. He kept his gaze on me, and not until I got closer did I notice the look of meaning deep within his stare. He looked pained, and sad. I guess he did see me and Andrew. Suddenly I felt rather depressed myself. I still feel for Freddie - that much evident - and it was obvious that seeing him hurting hurt me too. I tried to smile at him but his only acknowledgement of my gesture was a shake of the head and a glance at the floor. What have I done? *** Freddie I looked down to my shoes. How would she expect me to act after seeing her being picked up and kissed on the cheek by him? She knows how I feel about her! I am so madly in love with her - well maybe I left that small detail out - yet she goes off doing things with a guy she knows I dislike? Especially Andrew! After seeing them so close together at that party, and then her reappearing in my life days later to find how broken she was after what happened with him and their relationship failing - though as of now it seemed fine. But I was only a tad bit more partially surprised to hear her talking about how she was when I left her. I had thoughts and suggestions of the position I could have left her in, but I had no idea it was that bad. \"Let's eat!\" My mom called out loudly throughout the room. I heard the girls in the room continue their muffled whispers with the occasion of hearing my name very noticeable. I looked over at Poppy who was looking at me too. She let out another one of those sad smiles that she had occupying her face a lot these days. It only made my heart ache as I continued to stare at her. I could just get lost in those eyes. The same question kept coming up in my head. Why did I let you go? That's chapter 31 for ya! I hope it wasn't that bad... :( sorry if it was. But I tried! Well hopefully I'll have another one out before the end of the week but I'm sorry if i can't do that okay! thanks for waiting, and you guys have all been really great! reviews would be awesome!!! special thanks to one reviewer - J.E.M2010 - you're awesome and the total rock to my support system on here! thanks so much! :) Em P.S. hey guys... theres a HUGE storm coming in, and I have a feeling that the power is going to go out for me... it might be days, which would suck really bad cause then I can't post anything... : but I'm still going to try. I promise to get the next chapter out by atleast tuesday. sorry again for the wait. just been really busy with soccer,school,exams,performances,PT,drama,hell!, and such... sorry. love you guys.[Chapter 32] Poppy \"That was so awkward!\" I yelled throwing my suitcase with shoes on my bed. Kate watched me in silence while Drippy was putting away her chocolates and locking them up. I looked to her and she started snickering, then left the room. She's really pissy these days, and it's quite irritating. \"Why was is so awkward anyways? It's not like you too made up or are together again!\" Kate replied and turned to finish unpacking her own belongings. Suddenly we heard a knock at the door to only be greeted by Charlotte. Apparently she is taking over Harriet's place this semester? \"Poppy there's someone waiting for you in the lobby,\" Charlotte said. Okay, I guess she's not taking Harriet's place as the head bitch. \"Who is it?\" \"Go see for yourself,\" And with that she left leaving me there annoyed. Kate laughed. \"Why you so grumpy today? Aren't you exciting for being back? Or is it too much for you to actually start off a semester right.\" Kate said. I looked to her with disgust on my face clearly stated. Fine whatever. Be a bitch to the lacrosse team captain, but I hope you don't puke too much after the running I'm gonna make you do at the first practice. \"Bye,\" I grumbled and walked down the stairs to only run into Kiki who was wildly animated about whatever the hell she was talking about. \"Hey,\" I greeted her hoping that there wouldn't be tension between me and all my friends on the first day back. \"Hello Poppy,\" She replied happily and started walking past me up the stairs. \"Better get unpacking eh? See ya,\" And she vanished around the corner of the staircase. I continued walking down the stairs and saw who was waiting for me. \"Freddie!\" I yelled and smashed into him pulling my arms around his muscular figure. He immediately acknowledged my embrace and hugged back. I pulled away after what seemed to be hours (then again, moments with Freddie feel like days) and watched his lips curve into a smile. \"Miss me trouble?\" I never could get used to that British accent that swept me off my feet just months ago. First time I actually fell in love, and damn I fell hard! I smiled just remembering the feelings that would wash over me whenver I was with him. I still felt those same things every time he touched me, but I haven't told anyone - nor do I intend to. \"Yeah,\" I whispered and looked him in the eyes. Oops, mistake. I felt myself slip into a dream world where the only population was Freddie Kingsley and I. I got lost in those eyes of his, the sparkling bright orbs that always held so much passion. A game show love connection would pass through my body. He always blew my mind by his charismatic wit, and his chivalrious actions. The way he moves just puts me in a trance. And those muscles! Ah! I felt Freddie consume me into his arms once more. I snuggled my head into the crook of his neck that was if it was designed for me exactly. Perfect fit, and never was there once thing that was uncomfortable about the positions Freddie and I would find ourselves in. As long as it was with eachother. All memories of any other person slipped away once more as I breathed in Freddie's scent. I felt my heart slow at pace, but quickly speed up randomly. This boy always knew how to make my heart jump. And he always was the center of my dreams (plus that scent of his consumed me every time I dreamt about him). \"I missed you,\" His muffled voice rang through my hair. I heard him inhale my own scent and smiled into his neck knowing that he always does that when he is nervous about something. It's honestly the little things I know about him that make me love him so much. Even if he did leave me with no reasonable explanation in my time of need. Well, I forgave him practically the moment he stepped into my life (I think) once more, begging for me to come back and be the same I was before he acted so irationally. \"I missed you too Fredster,\" I giggled using Harriet's old petname for him. He groaned and took a step back from my body and just watched the way I moved. Hm, I wonder how I looked? \"So,\" he started. I took this as a cue to set some ground rules (knowing that I had some ugly topics I needed to discuss) for this boy so he knew what my situation was. Yes, I wanted to give Freddie another chance (most likely because I am so madly in love with him) but I knew that since I had these strong feelings for Andrew - which explained the passionate kiss earlier - that I should atleast test out myself. See if the feelings for Freddie are still there. You know? \"Let's start over then. Friends?\" I stucked out my pale hand (which looked quite awkward alone and shaking in the air) hoping for a truce or some form of agreement. I saw him debating with himself inside and out. His hands twitched (as did his eyes) and he took a step forward. \"Yeah,\" He spoke as he stared at my outstretched hand before placing his own in mine. I had to contain the laughter that was building in my chest. I have never seem Freddie so careful, so unsure of what was going on around him. \"Friends.\" I smiled at him and he returned it genuily. Then he pulled at my hand wrapping my arms around my petite figure once more. Friends can hug, right? \"Friends,\" I repeated. ..... Freddie Sure, this wasn't how I wanted things to be between Poppy and I. But, friends is a start. They always say that the best relationships come out of people who are friends first. \"Yeah, so it's getting pretty late. Maybe you should go back to your room and finish unpacking. We can go get some coffee tomorrow if you want? Or tea. Whatever you prefer.\" I smiled at the girl that I loved with my whole heart, the girl I imaged spending the rest of my already planned out life with, and the girl that just told me she wanted to be friends. Well, I think I can change her mind. \"True. So I'll see you tomorrow morning then?\" I nodded and she leaned up kissing me on the cheek immediately blushing afterward. What a great way to start off a friendship, I thought. She looks so damn cute when she blushes. If her soft lips had lingered on my cheek a moment longer than they did, I swear I would have lost it and completely grabbed her face pressing it to mine. I was so anxious and excited. I waited so long to feel her lips on my own again. I missed the feeling of being able to call this sweet, sassy, funny girl mine. She always swept me off my feet like the wind would do. I missed that beautiful smile that occupied her face when I would meet my eyes with hers. It lit up her entire body! And the vibes she would give off... Girl you got me going crazy. \"Night Trouble,\" I observed her as she walked up the stairs before I turned on my heels and headed towards my own sleeping quarters. \"Oh what you do to me Poppy Moore,\" I groaned as I held my chest as the obvious pain shot throughout it. I needed to call her mine again. I don't care if she kissed Andrew. I had her first, and I know I'm going to have her last. Andrew A person's rank among the hierarchy of social classes is determined at the moment of birth, whether they like the particular class they are ranked in or not. Then for the rest of their life, they either choose to conform to or rebel against the social norms of their specific class. Depending on the particular lifestyle, a person may be handed everything they would ever want and more on a silver platter from the moment of their first breathe while others have to work their fingers to the bone their whole lives to even get a glimpse of the life they could only dream about having. But contrary to popular beliefs, being a part of the highest social class' inner circle is not everything it is believed to be. To some people it is more of a burden than a benefit and unlike the majority of the world; they only wish to be a normal person, if only for a day. \"Lis, I don't think I can do this.\" I looked to my best friend who reminded me so much of the girl I fell in love with over my break. Sure, I missed her like hell, but now it's time for the hardest test a law student can take. And I need to focus. Yet, I can't seem to. This life in soccer and music I have been living in is the much expected. I hate law, but since my pap is a worldwide known lawyer, I'm stuck studying it. Why can't I just be a normal soccer player / musician for once in my life? Why do I have to do this? I don't want to take the bar! I don't want to be a lawyer, and hell I don't want to have to work for my dad for the rest of my life! I guess being with Poppy made me forget everything. Of course Lisa helped me through my daily troubles and obstacles, but she couldn't hide the pain (the way Poppy had) I felt being in law school when I could be out doing extra practices with my team.[Chapter 33] Poppy Hell why did he even have to go there?! We are friends, and then there goes Freddie rambling on about how much of a jackass Andrew is. For the period of time I spent with Andrew, all I can say is that he is the most amazing person I've ever known, (besides my mum) and that he truly cares about me. No matter how stupid I act sometimes. But Freddie, he just had to go and push my buttons. Me being well, me , I defended Andrew to the fullest and made Freddie fume. Of course then he threw out lies that were obviously made up on the spot, and then he ended up looking like a fool as I told him how it really goes down. I tried to be open to us as friends. Like people say, when you walk into a room don't close the door. Because then you don't give any space for your opinion and the opportunity to change it. Plus, if you close the goddamned door nobody will want to listen. \"He is such an ass!\" I found myself yelling into the air. I knew it was going to rain, but I didn't care. I needed to get away. If I went back to my room, surely one of the girls would know and want to talk to me about it. That would not make me happy the slightest. Then, if I even attempted just going somewhere else in the building I bet with my luck I'd run into Freddie. Then we'd fight again, knowing that I'd win he would be angry, then we would say more stupid things to each other. \"Who me?\" The obnoxious voice I was trying to avoid said behind me. \"Go away Freddie,\" I yelled without turning around to face him. The rain started pouring down then, and I mean pouring. \" No we need to talk!\" He yelled back, his voice muffled slightly by the rain. \"About what!? How you don't like one of my best friends and you just feel the need to hate on them? Sorry if I defended someone I care about! Just back off,\" I shouted turning around this time. I was furious, and this time I knew exactly why. Freddie flinched at the words 'best friends' while his mouth hang open for a moment. \"Poppy just listen! I didn't mean to get you worked up back there okay?\" There he went, lying to my face. I didn't know he got that good at it during our time apart. Guess you never know. \"No I will not listen to you! Just leave me be Freddie. Clearly you can't be my friend! \" I was fine with not having Freddie as a friend, but he needs to be in my life. I need him in my life, in some way. He patched up my wound, and now he's honestly the only one who can keep it closed this perfectly. \"I'm not going anywhere. Poppy, just please forgive me. I didn't mean it. I'm just...\" He stopped looking at me dropping his gaze to his soaking wet shoes. The rain weighed down his hair, and dramatically changed the color of his naturally very blonde hair. Oh how much I would give to touch it now... \"You just what?\" \"I'm jealous!\" Those were not the words I was expecting, yet I did quite like them. \"Of what?\" I choked out feeling the rain make my throat cold, and my mouth dry. \"Andrew.\" He said the name like it was supposed to be obvious. It was, but I was too caught up with the fact that I made him jealous. He went on trying to make me forgive him. Even though I did in some ways already. I was glad he finally admitted his jealously. It made me feel... good. \"Poppy, you know I love you. And I care for you very much. Just listen to me when I tell you this. Okay, I promise to always be there for you. And despite the fact that I don't really like Andrew,\" He sneered the name while looking away and playing with his hands. \"I will not disrespect him any longer. I'm truly sorry. Forgive me please.\" I began organizing my thoughts, hoping, no - praying - that their would be another chance for me to talk with Freddie heart-to-heart. Now that i'd just found out that he really loves me, I just need to get it back. Well, not get it back, more like make it stronger and more unrequited. The way it used to be, when it was just the two of us, and there was absolutely nothing stopping us from being together. But now, after the summer break, things changed. Apparently people changed too. New friends, and new enemies. Even strong relationships got dented - or even broken. \"I forgive you,\" I ended up following my heart. Even if I acted quite differently most of the time, I was raised as a 'forgive and forget' kind of girl. This was exactly what I was doing. \"Andrew is a really great guy,\" I smiled hoping that I as agitating him just the slightest. Hey, I can have a little fun! \"Yes Trouble, he's fantastic.\" Freddie grumbled and took a step towards me. I had completely ignored the fact that my entire outfit weighed about 20 plus pounds by now, from all of the water it had absorbed in this little encounter I was having with my ex-boyfriend, of whom I loved. \"Thank you for agreeing to play nice,\" Smiling I looked up to meet his eyes which seemed to grow farther and higher away from me as he stepped closer. Well, he was about a foot taller than me, making his eyes be a lot higher up that my level of sight. Even though I can't look tall guys in the eyes, man did I love them. ALways so strong, and warming! Then, that nature feeling of secureness and love was there whenever you were embraced by him. Of course my favorite was the spinny hugs, where he would lift me from the ground by the waist. Yes, playing lacrosse my body was now 90% weighted from muscle mass. And not too many boys around here could lift me up unless they were taller, or a football player. \"Your welcome Miss Moore, but i fear we are going to get sick.\" \"That's true,\" Letting reality kick in. We have been standing in the pouring ran for what could have been an hour, in a minimal amount of clothing. We're probably going to get sick. \"We can go inside.\" \"Alright come on Trouble,\" He smiled stepping to me and taking my hand, turning his body towards the courtyard and the main entrance. \"Don't want mummy to be too mad at you now do we?\" I giggled and followed him willingly. I really hope things will start to get normal between us again. .... 2 weeks later It's been 2 weeks since the day we came back to Abbey Mount. I'm still captain of my lacrosse team, and have been practicing non-stop for the past week. I want to win, and I heard that training is what it takes, so be it. The girls and I are pretty much back to normal now. Even Drippy is pretty... well, I won't say that we are best friends. But, she enjoys the fact that I talk with Freddie a lot more than I (secretly) text Andrew. Speaking of Freddie, he and I are a lot more closer to what we were coming out of last semester. Back to the inside jokes, and the sneaking around together on campus just to hang out. Yeah, I bet Freddie's mom knows about us already, but she doesn't seem to mind. She's probably only keeping the rule since it for the most part keeps the rest of the girls away. Which, I like (not that I'd even ever admit that to him, since we're friends). Freddie even occasionally sneaks a kiss on my cheek before I go off to bed at night. It brings back that tingling sensation of love and lust I used to feel oh so strongly just a month or so ago. Thank goodness it was dark when he would do it, or else he would watch my cheeks light up into the color of a ripe raspberry. And that would not be helping on the whole 'friends' relationship that we had agreed on. '1 New Text Message' Drew!! flashed across my sidekick. I smiled grabbing for my blanket and plopping down on my bed, cuddling up to my pillow. I slid open my phone and read the message. Drew!! - I miss you. How ya holdin up lately w/o mee? P oppz - I miss U MRE! N I been okkkayy... Jst gettin 2b friends w/Fred again. Takn a while, but i thnk we o.k. now. he says hes srry. i forgave him, mmber? I had told Andrew about the little thing that went down on the first day back. (Too bad I didn't mention the jealously part over the phone, cause I swear he would have laughed) Drew! - Good gurl. You kickin ass fo me lacrosse? :) Make me proud girly. He always knew the right things to say, and that's so why I love him! See, my love for Andrew differs from Freddie. The way I see it, is that I love Andrew because I need him. But, I need Freddie because I love him. I know there is a difference. I've spent endless nights trying to figure out which is which, and who it refers to. So far this is what I came up with. Drew! - Btw, imma be vistin you N kate soon. in about 3 weeks? yeah. I wrote you another song, :) i know ull like it. well i gotta go. Poppz - To answer ur first q, yes i am kickin ass fo you! :D i try sooo hard, i even whopped ur sissy! (srry :)) and as for visiting... epppp!~!#R(*993 yay! :D i can't wait to hear my song tooooo. kate will B jealous haha, love you. ttys Drew... 3 Sighing, i leaned back and snapped closed my sidekick. So, Andrew will be visiting again. If Freddie meant what he says, then there should not be tension. (Well, i know there's going to be tension, just hopefully it's subsided for the most part) And hopefully, Andrew doesn't come looking to start a fight with him. But knowing Drew, he wouldn't do something that would hurt me. He knows that Freddie is a person that hurts me... So Andrew wouldn't put me in the position where he provokes Freddie to the point where he gets angry, then hurts me. (Not Physically of course!) I suppose I should talk to Kate for some advice. But even her, she wouldn't have much. She's not the best in the area of boys. But Andrew is her brother, and she has known Freddie for a while... \"Oh love, the things you do to me...\" I whispered into the open air letting my eyelids shut tightly to a close, while I dreamt of a simpler world. If only that could be the one I was living in....[Chapter 34] Poppy As I stood on the side of the field watching my team practice, the thoughts of the two boys in my life were the only constant things on my mind. Though, I still yelled at the girls from time to time. \"Stop slacking!\" or even a, \"Work harder or you'll be on the bench!\" and sometimes I'd throw in an occasional, \"I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't hurry it up! This isn't girl scouts ladies!\" Which was probably a little harsh on them (since it was only the 2nd practice) but I didn't care. I want to win, and normally when you push people they will do better. Especially in sports. \"Okay ladies, water break.\" I watched them all sigh and slump over to the water cooler, bottles in hand. Kate slouched as she made her way towards me. Knowing her, she'd probably come whine to me about something that she didn't like, or was too hard. Maybe she'd even throw in, 'unfair' just to make me \"feel bad.\" Normally, all it made me see was just how out-of-shape half of the lacrosse team was. I mean, yes there were a couple very athletic and talented girls, where the rest of them look just about as lost as I did when I first came to Europe. \"Why aren't you working with us?\" Kate mumbled taking a sip from her water bottle. \"Because. If I do, then I can't make sure everyone works. I need to be able to observe.\" Kate looked annoyed at my response. Most likely since she knew it was true, and that what I was saying was legit. Her and I both knew that if nobody was pushing and watching the girls, then they would all slack off. Bunch of losers. \"Yeah.. true..\" \"I'll still jump in for the drills though. And scrimmages.\" She looked even more annoyed at this response. The only thing I'd really be missing out on was the sprinting and basic skill drills. Which, clearly I was already a master at. \"Right. Do you think I could have a break with you for a while?\" How could I expect much less? She continued, while adding in an excuse. Of course. \"I kind of rolled my ankle in the last defense drill.\" I faked a smile her way nodded and turned back to the team as Kate took a seat on the bench. \"Alright girls, let's get back to it. I want you 6,\" I pointed to Drippy, Kiki, Josie and 3 other blonde girls, \"To go over to the far side, and play offense on my command. You'll come at the goal, in groups of two.\" I turned around as I heard them whisper something as they took off for the far side of the field. \"Now the rest of you, go stand behind the goal, and you'll come out one at a time. After the first pass is made, then the second person will come out. Go.\" They all went to their places too, and I then proceeded to wait as they made their pairings. \"Okay! Start!\" And the drill began. \"Poppy your phone is buzzing,\" Kate yawned after saying this. She took my phone and handed it to me. \"Thanks...\" I mumbled sliding it open. ' 1 New Text Message' Drew! - hey. missed ya. wat ya up to now? Smiling to myself, I started to reply back. Poppz - I'm okkkayy. :D you kno, the usual. just at practice. kate 'hurtherankle' and asked to sit out. i think she just doesn't like my drills ;) haha. i miss you too... Drew! - goodness, that girl is lazy eh? Ur typing like ur upset. What happened? or is it you just misss Me SO MUCH!? jk. ur prob PMS-ing :):) I gasped, making Kate turn her head up at me in interest. \"Who is talking to you?\" \"Oh... Uhm, it's just Molly.\" Not quite sure why I lied, but I did. Kate just nodded still looking at me with curiousity and disbelief. But eventually she turned away. Poppz - I doubt you even know what PMS is ANDREW. Drew! - Why yes, I do. Nicholas Sparks said that is means 'pissed at men' LMAO :D he's so awesome hahhaah. but yeah. i was just joking Moore, no need to flip. unless you really are PMSing... Moments after re-reading his message at least twice, I found myself giggling. Again, Kate looked at me in wonder. I ignored her once more, then turned back to my phone. Before I replied though, I realized another thing. I really liked every single thing about Andrew. Literally, I couldn't find one thing that I didn't like about him... That might be a problem for Freddie and I in the future, or it would be just another thing that made Andrew and I such good friends. Either way, one of the guys I love will end up hurt. And not to my surprise, I honestly didn't know which one I could bare to make any more unhappy. Interrupting my thoughts, a blonde girl came up to me asking if they could take a water break. To me, it felt like on 5 minutes since I started the drill. But, once I checked my clock, it said that 45 minutes had passed. I didn't even realize while I was talking to Andrew... Sometimes I just totally forget where I am. I must love him a lot, since that happens quite frequently. Come to think of it, that hasn't happened all that much with Freddie and I, which makes me think that maybe we never really were compatible. Now that I think of it, he probably only felt slightly obligated to stay with me over the summer because he knew how much I liked him, (not that it would kill him to come to Cali for summer, which would be awesome to almost any teenager). Why do I keep doubting his love for me? He's brainwashing you. The tiny voice in my head rang. No! Andrew loves you a lot more than Freddie ever did, or possibly didn't. Plus, he was there for you when you needed him! Now, I was confused. And it's not like there was anybody I could ask! Not Kate, or any of my other roommates. They're all bi-ast. For all I know, Kate probably hates the idea of me and her brother together. Yeah, she did tell me it was okay to be friends with him, but that's not what I wanted - not even close. ..... Walking into the dining hall, I watched all the smaller girls nervously look for a seat. Some of them still hadn't made any progress by the time I made it to my table, and I almost walked over there to ask her to sit with me. Almost. Then I noticed her eyes flutter towards the door, attracting more than half the other girls around her. I looked up too, to see Freddie walking in with his ironed khaki pants, and a blue rolled up polo. I almost choked at how handsome he looked in the light. After composing myself, I quickly sat down in my seat burying my head in my hands, feeling guilty. Ever since I kissed Andrew, I would feel guilty around Freddie. But whenever I saw Andrew, I would feel guilty knowing about all the things I've already done with Freddie (and most likely might be doing in the future). This only frustrated me further, and made me not want anything to do with either of them. Yet facing the truth, I loved and needed both of them. It was a fact, and heck there was no point in avoided it. I felt a tap on my shoulder causing me to bolt upright and open up my eyes. As I adjusted to the light in the room, I heard the angelic voice on the headmistresses son, and the boy who I loved with half of my heart. \"You okay Poppy?\" His voice rang. Stubbornly, I turned away from him scanning the room for anything that could possibly make him leave me alone without having to answer him. All I got was a couple glares and winks with a thumbs up. Stupid girls. \"Yeah. Tired from practice, I suppose.\" Honestly, England is changing the way I talk these days! My vocabulary used to be very limited, but now it was like I was a thesaurus. Always coming up with complicated words that meant the same thing as those other simpler words that I had come so used to loving and using. Great, now I'm a nerd with a broken heart, who is torn between two guys. Girls really are too stressed these days. Especially the smart ones. \"Alright. Go to bed early tonight then,\" He responded. It sounded like he was at loss for words as he spoke. He hesitated before giving me a one-armed hug, and heading off to the head table that had his mother and all the other teachers, or prefects. \"Yup. Bed. Sure,\" Quickly plopping my head back down on the table, I pulled down my skirt absently while humming a soothing song. Maybe it's true, I can't live without you And maybe two, is better than one There's so much to time, to figure out the rest of my life And you've already got me coming undone, And I'm thinkin' two is better than one... I remember every look upon your face The way you roll your eyes the way you taste, you make it hard for breathing Cause when I close my eyes and drift away, I think of you and everything's okay I'm finally now believin... .... Two is Better than One... Hearing the voices of my roommates telling me to stand up for respects, I lifted my body up not bothering to open my eyes. After hearing the clanking of chairs, I plopped back down in my own, bringing my hands together ready to say the prayers as we did everyday. Keeping my eyes closed, all I could honestly think of was Andrew. No Freddie. Just Andrew, the boy who was nearly thousands of miles away from me right now. I couldn't even think of that other person I loved, sitting right in front of me staring at me now, (I felt his eyes) because the attraction/emotions towards Andrew were almost too strong for words. I think I made my decision, but I still can't come around to saying it outloud. As the meal continued on not noticing my silence, I thought over whether or not I was serious in what I was saying, or if this way just my pain in missing Andrew taking over now. I mean, how could I actually miss Freddie if he's right here? Clearly I couldn't, so of course Andrew would be on my mind more. Right? Or would that be wrong? Freddie is here, so I should be thinking about him instead. \"I don't even know anymore...\" Josie turned towards me smiling sympathetically, then quickly squeezed my hand under the table. What seemed like a friendly gesture, meant so much more to me than she knew. It meant someone actually did care about how I was feeling. And it was a sign that someone was listening. Thank You. ..... Trudging back through the grass with my lacrosse stick in hand, I felt my mind quickly taking over. Walking faster towards the field and letting the rain fall harder on me by the second, I knew I'd need to clear my thoughts completely in order to be at peace for the next week or so. At least until Andrew came, then I'd be okay for a while. Flipping the ball in my stick, cradling it, and running all felt natural to me. Running around the goals and across the field, finally seemed to feel like a rountine. I didn't think about anything. I was completely blank, and strangely I loved it. I have a feeling I'm going to be doing this a lot more now... If only you were here mom... Alright. I have a couple of announcements. First off, I think that this 'A Real Wild Child' might be coming to an end. I keep having a writers block, and I'm not sure I have the time to keep trying to write through it. Plus, since I don't get all that much feedback, I don't get many ideas anymore. I might do a sequel, but only if that is asked of me by a lot of people. Hopefully there are enough people who care and actually want to keep reading that they'd comment and tell me this. If not, then I might have more difficulty picking up and writing once more. So here it is, my excuses for delay. One, nobody seems to comment except the same three people (thank you, you know who you are :D ) Two, even those others who comment, they only say they love it. What do you love about it? How could I make it better? I came on here writing and hoping that someone would help me get better, and critique me. I'll take any comments and instructions. I won't judge anyone's opinions or thoughts (even if I did, I wouldn't be mean about it). So please, if you really are interested, give a little more in the feedback. Thanks. Three, as I said before, my writers block. Again, your comments would help...? : I'd love to get more. As of now, the next chapter will be the last on the little book/story/--whatever. If you want a sequel, well... you know what to do. Thank you for reading. Thanks for your patience. Emily[Chapter 35] ~Poppy~ Here goes nothing... So, I've done a lot of thinking lately, and well I have come to a conclusion. For starters, I will not be going back and forth between 2 guys, it's so Bella Swan. Second, I've come to realize something very important in the decision I am going to be making soon. Which one will I see more? Which one will I be be able touch, and let hold me, more? Because, hell, if there's no physical contact in our relationship, I'm not so sure I can keep it up much longer. Though there were two voices speaking in my mind contradicting one another, I could only think of what was to come of what I was doing. Right this second, I was walking towards the guy that I wanted to spend the rest of my senior year with, & possibly go off to college with, while having him in mind. It might not seem like something big for other people -well, many people actually - but it was very important to me. For many reasons. I think everything through (lie) before I do things... Or rather I like to think of the best way to get things done. My steps felt like they were growing in volume, and pace. I felt my palms shaking ever so slightly, as I perspired cooly on my forehead. I walked up to the tall figure with the thick, beautiful hair that was blowing soundlessly in the wind. I tapped his shoulder. \"Hey can I talk with you?\" He turned around, his eyes glancing first on my collarbone, then widening, but then eventually landing on my eyes. A soft smile appeared on his lips. \"Of course.\" I took a deep breath getting ready to talk. \"I know how I have been very undecided lately as to who I want to be with, but I am absolutely positive about who it is now. I just hope that he feels the same way.\" I paused, letting the words sink in a little bit before I continued. Before I started up again, I felt his hand slide into mine, making me smile too. We looked like a young couple, falling in love with each other all over again. The moment was almost too private for such a public place it was taking place in. \"I love you. And it's as more than the love of a friend that cares for someone. I love you with all my heart. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you, and I now understand that you feel the same way. I was so blind not to notice this before. Everything about you and I, makes me smile. I know it won't be simple, nor easy, but I know that we can do this.\" I watched his face brighten instantly, and his hand make it's way towards my cheek. \"We can do this.\" I repeated. It happened all too quickly, I almost didn't process it. Freddie's moist lips smothered mine in the way I've been longing them to do so, and I felt as if everything was in place once more. We were back, and there was nothing stronger than the feelings we had for each other. This time, there's no pretending. No complications. Everything will work out, and it's a promise that we have made to each other, with this kiss we are sharing right now. Did you ever notice how brisk the air can be on a October Day in England? Stinging, cold, and heartless is the wind on such a day that one can feel only it in the absence of warmth. But our bodies together, now moving in perfect sync, made everything else oblivious. Our bodies together giving us just the right amount of heat to keep us more than comfortable. The moment ended all too quickly as we needed to inhale a bit more of that chilly air. \"I love you,\" He whispered to me caressing my cheek once more pulling my body closer to his, yet again. My cheeks flashed a scarlet red, and that's when I knew. I made the right choice. \"It's you. It's always been you,\" I almost started crying as I spoke to him. I knew deep down, that this was what was meant to happen. Him, holding me in his arms, the one place I was fit to be in, forever. All it took was the help of a best friend. If I never met Andrew, I doubt I would be as happy as I am right now. It was true, I did need Andrew. But, I confused the need for a deep feeling of madly in love. Good thing I got that all straightened out. \"I know. Just wish it didn't take so long for you to finally figure out.\" And he kissed my lips again, the tender, yet passion filled kiss made my heart flutter. Damn, I thought fairy tales were dead... :) Thanks mom. Thanks Drew. I guess that's it... It may be short, but hey, that's kind of what people wanted. I have a tad bit more material for a sequel already, but it's still all up to you guys on whether you want one. Thanks everyone who read, & thank you to all those people who review. Special thanks to J.E.M2010 for always reviewing, & giving words of support or wisdom.
