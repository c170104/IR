I do not own SB and don't pretend to be anywhere near as good as Emily Giffin. It's Time. \"Dex?\" It's three in the morning, my nightgown is soaked and I am \"OW!\" pretty certain our daughter is about to make her entrance into this world tonight. If only I could wake my sleeping husband. \"Dexter.\" I pant through the next contraction relieved as hell when opens his eyes the expression quickly changing from outright love to bolt-upright fear in seconds. \"Rach what's? Julia is she coming?\" He says in one breath excited and scared at the same time immediately taking my hand and looking into my eyes. \"Oh OW Yes. Babe she's coming! She's really coming!\" I cannot help but, beam through the pain as he kisses my forehead and goes to grab the hospital bag from the wardrobe. \"Where are you going?\" I say instantly horrified at the loss of contact. \"I'll be one minute I promise I just have to grab the bag.\" I swear to god I have never seen my husband move so fast. \"Got it, MA!\" He kisses me hard and eases me off the bed. \"Let's go have our baby Dex.\" The car ride is a blur as is arriving at the hospital, booking in and all those things I had spent weeks obsessing over. Because I'm having a baby. I'm having Dexter Thaler's baby. Our little girl. I am now sat upright with a midwife way down south of my comfort zone while Dexter helplessly wipes my sweat soaked brow as I inhale gas and air like its chocolate. \"AHHH.\" I see pain on his face he said I could squeeze as hard as I wanted because he loves me and it will be nothing compared to what I feel but, I can tell I am cutting off the blood supply to his fingers. So I loosen my grip. \" Oh I am so sorry. I'm a terrible wife I'm going to be a terrible mother. \" I sob \"The hell you are.\" He strokes my face and kisses away my tears. \"You're my girl. My strong brave and beautiful human rights lawyer wife.\" \"Continue…\" I say through another strong contraction which causes a chuckle from the midwife. \"You are intelligent, fierce funny… and sexy.\" \"Very sexy.\" He whispers lovingly placing several kisses on my forehead. \"That is what got us in to this in the first place!\" Is barked back at the poor man as it is confirmed after three long ass hours of labour I am finally the \"Magic Ten.\" \"Rachel when I say I'm going to need you to start pushing ok?\" The midwife instructs. \"I don't know if…\" I sob and scream. \"Yes you can Rachel. I love you and our baby. YOU CAN DO THIS.\" \"Ok.\" \"Alright Rachel, PUSH!\" \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.\" \"And again.\" \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.\" \"YOU ARE DOING SO GOOD RACH.\" Jesus he's on the verge of beautiful tears I am on the verge of tears. We're all wrecks. \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGETHER OUT OF MEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" Ten pushes later. \"Can you feel that?\" The midwife asks inquisitively. I can feel something soft and squelchy underneath me. \"What is it?\" The choice to go without drugs has clearly gone to my head as Dexter walks to the end of my bed and marvels. \"It's her. OH GOD RACH SHE's SO CLOSE!\" \"ONE MORE RACHEL\" I hear as he returns to my side so valiantly. \"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.\" I scream then I hear it crying. Beautiful shrieks of life. Belonging to a baby. Our baby. I'm openly sobbing with joy now as she raises up this bloody little being, a perfect mix of both of us. She has thick black sticky up hair and chubby little hands that are already curled upwards. As if she is ready to give this world the proverbial F word it deserves \"Congratulations Mr and Mrs Thaler. You are now parents to a healthy 8lb girl.\" She cleans her quickly helps Dex cut the cord and wraps her in this lavender blanket and hat to keep her warm. \"Happy Birthday Julia.\" Dexter says having gently stretched his arms out to take her. She fits in his arms like a glove just, staring up at him an odd gurgle in between the greatest display of cuteness I have ever seen. He rocks her gently and I can't help but, put my hand on my heart and sigh as he slowly walks over to me. \"I'm your Daddy and THIS. This is Mommy.\" He kisses me softly and passes her gently to me. \"Oh…\" In a contented sigh getting used to the wriggling little girl who's currently attempting to kick against the blanket while her hands poke through a tiny finger links onto mine and I swear I feel like I might die of happiness. This is more than Dexter's proposal, more than the impromptu courthouse wedding. This is everything. I am somebody's wife, somebody's mother. I am Julia's mother. \"I love you so much.\" I say kissing her little for-head when the health checks are done and the three of us are finally alone. Julia makes persistently loud cries and I smile at Dexter. \"I think she's hungry.\" I say half anxious half excited lifting my shirt up as he helps me. \"Honey I can leave….\" He offers having spent my entire pregnancy reading up on the importance of \"Mommy and baby bonding\" especially during the first feed. (Breastfeeding was totally and completely my choice by the way he didn't pressure me for one second though, honestly do you think he would still be breathing if he did?) \"No. No.\" I say tenderly. \"We want daddy to stay don't we Princess?\" She gurgles as I unwrap and place her on my right breast and watch as she steadily guides her mouth over to it. Julia latches and I am not going to lie it hurts a lot but, is still far removed from the pain I felt fifteen minutes ago. The fact that it is for the nourishment of my baby. OUR BABY takes it all away. \"Enjoy this.\" I say happily taking the opportunity to take in the new noises Julia is happily making as she suckles. He moves to sit beside us on the bed and fits perfectly. \"Peace and quiet before we have to destroy our sanctuary and inform our relatives that they are now biologically and emotionally obligated to purchase several gifts a year for our offspring?\" He jokes and I punch him lightly in the chest. \"OW.\" \"Yes but, I was thinking… More along the lines of…. you're not going to be able to see well these for a while.\" I watch his mind working processing this. \"No time for…\" \"Umm Hmm. Not according to those parenting books you are so fond of.\" \"Damn it.\" \"She's worth it though,\" I push. \"Oh yes.\" Kissing me fully as the baby finishes up. \"You're both so worth it.\" God, I'm going to make it so worth his while when we do get five minutes alone. … One Week Later. \"Oh why won't you sleep huh?\" I say bobbing her gently in my arms as my husband tests a dribble of milk on his wrist. \"Why won't you sleep Munchkin?\" I kiss her cheeks as she yawns and shrieks. \"I hate this! Babe is that ready?\" \"Perfect.\" He passes it to me and I tip it up slowly so that she can easily suck on the artificial teat full of warm milk I hurriedly expressed earlier. \"That's it. Good Girl.\" She finishes her feed and is down in her Moses basket within the hour which is safely nestled at the end of our bed. We collapse with each other fully clothed on the bed we miss so much. \"Whoever said the first week was bliss is a damn liar.\" I gasp out snuggling into the crook of his neck. \"Your mom said that.\" He notes quite gleefully. \"Trust you to remember.\" I say sarcastically kissing the nerve in his exposed neck and working my way up until I reach his lips. \"You know she loves you.\" I joke continuing my U rated exploration. \"I think she wishes she was married to you instead.\" \"I do love your mom…\" \"Ahem! Wife and child in the room.\" \"No, Rachel.\" He pulls me close to him and kisses me fiercely. \"I love her and your dad for giving me you.\" \"That is by far the single cheesiest thing you have ever said to me in our entire relationship our affair included.\" \"Cheesy? I was going for romantic\" \"Then keep going and see where it gets you.\" \" I love you Rach.\" \" MA! I love you too.\" We close our eyes and sleep. Finally.

Why is that?\" \"Ethan is our best friend.\" Darcy sighed, uninterested. Dex had met her and Marcus for lunch the day after he and Rachel had a heated argument. She hadn't called him since and he wasn't about to apologize. \"Dude, that guy stuck to her like glue.\" Marcus spoke up, taking a swig of his drink. \"Which is fine, but she's my girlfriend now, and I feel like I should be the first man in her life. She should have told me first.\" Dex shook his head and stared at the table. \"You're being so dramatic.\" Darcy rolled her eyes and put a hand on her pregnant belly. \"Look at me. I was her best friend before anyone and do you see me complaining that she didn't tell me something sooner? No. Because I learned a long time ago that there are some things, that no matter what happens, Rachel will always have to go to Ethan for.\" \"Not something like this.\" Dex regarded Darcy with a little more respect. She almost sounded…serious. \"Ethan's a cool dude.\" Marcus added. \"He is.\" Dex agreed. \"But I'm here for Rachel now. Here. In New York. She shouldn't have to go running halfway across the planet to find a guy to be there for her. I already am.\" \"Dex, you can't take it personally. Rachel and Ethan have been inseparable since the sixth grade. Even if you were Leonardo DiCaprio in all his youthful glory, she would still need Ethan in her life. It's always been the three of us.\" Darcy shrugged. \"The sooner you accept that and stop dicking around, the easier it gets. Take it from the pro.\" She motioned for the waitress to get her another lemonade, crabby since Marcus had been diligently keeping alcohol away from her. \"Why doesn't she just marry him then, if they're so perfect?\" Marcus asked the two, chuckling slightly. \"The same reason I don't marry Ethan,\" Darcy explained, \"ew.\" \"I didn't even see Ethan as competition. But did I read that all wrong?\" Dex suddenly became very troubled. \"He's so in the friend zone.\" Marcus assured his friend. \"Dex, she likes you.\" Darcy sat up a little straighter, focusing on the man she once was sure she'd marry. \"But you have to face the facts of Rachel's life along with the rest of the relationship you two have. You can't ask her to forget the guy that took her to her first dance. Her first kiss. The first time she got drunk. Ethan was a part of so many of her firsts. Some people just come along with the ones we want. Ethan will be wherever Rachel and I are.\" \"Wait. Her first kiss? The golf course?\" Dex replayed the conversation he remembered having with Rachel about how her first kiss was. But they had never actually discussed who it was with. \"That was Ethan?\" 00 \"Ethan!\" Rachel's voice echoed softly across the grass. \"Come back here!\" Instead of listening, Ethan appeared only to grab her hand and pull her further onto the putting green. \"We are going to get in so much trouble!\" \"But think of how angry Darcy will be when she can't find us.\" Ethan was already snickering. Rachel couldn't help but smile. Sleepovers at Darcy's house were a fairly common thing for the three teens to plan, but the late night walk through the woods surrounding Darcy's house, telling ghost stories, had been Darcy's idea. Rachel had clung to Ethan as they stumbled along the paths, hoping her mother would never find out about this. Darcy's parents would almost surely ground her if they woke up and couldn't find the kids. \"She should have found us by now.\" Rachel looked around the course, scared out of her mind. \"Relax, Rache. She'll show up.\" Ethan was studying the stars. \"Do you think Tiger Woods knew he was good at golf when he was thirteen?\" \"Who's Tiger Woods?\" Rachel frowned. \"Some sports person?\" \"Golf.\" Ethan helped her. He smiled affectionately. \"Stupid.\" \"Ugly.\" She taunted. He chuckled and then they heard the sound of Darcy's voice. \"Rachel!\" she was close. Rachel breathed a sigh of relief and started to walk in the direction of Darcy's voice, but Ethan grabbed her and quickly pressed his lips to hers. She pulled away in shock. \"Just practicing. Darcy's next.\" He teased and ran off to meet Darcy who had stumbled out of the woods. Rachel stood still, fingers on her lips. He had stolen her first kiss. It was nothing like the movies. And she would never forgive him. But it would make for a good story. 00 \"She was thirteen.\" Darcy waved it off. \"But yeah. She was too scared to do anything like that with an actual guy. Ethan was like her first everything. He's the reason she's able to do anything cool whatsoever.\" \"Everything?\" Marcus wiggled his eyebrows teasingly. \"Shut up.\" Darcy nudged him playfully. Then she noticed Dex's serious face. \"I mean…\" \"He was her first?\" Dex's eyes went wide. \"You're not kidding.\" \"Maybe you should ask her about it.\" Darcy grimaced. She tried to look anywhere but Dex's face. \"How many times?\" he gasped desperately. \"I don't know! Ask her.\" Darcy held up her hands. \"She had to learn on someone.\" \"Yeah, not with the guy that she's still more involved with than anybody!\" Dex slammed the table. \"I need to call her.\" \"You mean she hasn't called you?\" Darcy raised her eyebrows. \"No. Should she have? We argued. I figured I'd give her time to cool off.\" \"Have you texted her?\" \"I tried but the messages didn't go through and I didn't care enough to figure it out.\" \"I think you might want to call her.\" Darcy was holding back a smirk. \"Why?\" \"She should be off the plane by now.\" Darcy started giggling. Dex jumped out of the booth and dialed Rachel's number as fast as he could. She answered through the third ring. \"Dex?\" \"Rachel. Where are you?\" \"London.\" ","Summary":" \"She told him before me.\" Dex scoffed. \"She waited a whole day to tell the rest of us, but he ge"},{"Movie":"Something Borrowed","Title":"All the days of my life","Author":"Valkyrie Ashleigh Smith","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8108129","Passage":"[Chapter 1] All the days of my life. I met her short after graduating from high school; she was beautiful and complicated. I still remember the day we met. I was in TORTS class; it was the first day and I hoped the day would be over soon. The door opened and she walked in. And in the moment I saw her, I just knew. I knew she was going to be mine. She stood in front of me with her polka dotted handbag. I could see her pink lips moving but I could not hear any words. She shook her hand in front of me. \"Hello?\" She asked. \"Yes?\" I finally responded; \"Is this sit taken?\" She asked once more. I looked at the empty sit beside me. \"No, not at all\" I said, between laughs. \"May I..?\" \"Yes, of course\" \"Thanks\" \"No problem\" I could not help to stare. She was playing with her dark, brown curly hair. She noticed I was staring at her and turned to me. I turned to my notebook and cleared my throat. I hadn't written anything. \"It's my first day here, well, my first day in town and I don't know anyone, so…I was wondering if you could help me find a loft or something\" I could tell by her American accent that she was from Chicago. I narrowed my eyes, thinking of the chances of taking her home before I thought possible. \"I mean, if you're not available or just don't want to it is okay. I'm some crazy girl you just met\" \"No.\" \"No?\" \"No, no, I mean…I don't think you're crazy\" She smiled shyly. I could feel my heart beating faster. I smiled back at her. The teacher arrived and she took out five pens. I watched, not speaking. She laughed nervously, and so did I. \"It's always better to be prevented, right?\" \"Yeah\" She put a notebook on the desk and all the pens dropped. \"Shit\" I gave her my pen. She looked at me, startled. \"What are you gonna write with?\" \"It's okay, I'll just listen\" I smiled at her. ","Summary":" All the days of my life.

For Nat and Guest who made my day when they reviewed \"The Question.\" Just a Little Woozy Oh I feel like I've been hit by several trains at once and all the pain is concentrated to my fragile head. \"You look like shi...\" \"Do NOT finish that sentence Hilary. I need to get these appeals filed.\" \"You need.\" She cups my face as she speaks. \"To go home and have that sexy teacher husband of yours take care of your every whim.\" \"You think Dexter's sexy?\" \"YOU DON'T?\" \"Funny.\" I throw the lime green paper- ball I created earlier at her head. It misses barely. \"Hey.\" \"Don't get antsy with me I'm not the one who's done this to you.\" What The Hell is she talking about? \"What are you going on about Hil?\" \"Rachel. Remind me again when did you go on Honeymoon?\" She says in all seriousness while twirling a pencil between her fingers. She may have well have just come out and said: \"So when did you and your husband last do the nasty?\" Jesus. \"I'm not pregnant.\" \"I'm just a little... Woozy.\" Hilary rolls her eyes; a \"yeah right\" if ever I saw one. \"I AM NOT.\" I am suddenly aware that my voice is rising and my very reasonable boss Richard could come over at any second. \" Pregnant.\" \"I can't be. It's not the right time.\" \"Rachel. It's you and Dexter when has \"The right time\" ever been your strong-point?\" \"We've only been married three months. Dex has only just started at his new school…\" I trail off my list of excuses clutching at straws. \"Do you both want kids?\" \"Of course we do Hilary.\" \"So what's the harm in taking a test?\" \"There isn't…\" Before I can form my next words she's pushing away my paper-work pulling me gently up and pushing me and my briefcase out the door. \"HILARY!\" \"It is 2:30pm Rach! You haven't had a day off in ages and you and the future President of Mensa in there need it!\" \"But, Richard!\" \"I'll cover for you. Now will you PLEASE go home, lie down, make out with your hubby and take the damn test. Preferably, before another human being comes shooting out of your vagina.\" \"Ok.\" \"Call me later?\" \"I'll call you later.\" I sigh admitting defeat and beginning the short walk back to mine and Dexter's apartment. Would it really be such a bad thing if I were though? I mean I know what I have just said to my best friend but, honestly? We both have decent jobs and savings stored away for a \"rainy day\" and all both of our parents can talk about is when they're going to get their first grandbaby. Dexter's reply of \"All good things come to those who wait\" always got smiles and the most loving of looks from me. He never pressures or says a definitive \"yes I want three children within the allotted timescale\" because he loves me or perhaps, because he knows I have friends in \"The DIVORCE trade.\" \"There's no rush hon. We'll be together no matter what. Jelly-beans or no Jellybeans.\" I hear his reassuring voice in my head and suddenly I feel calmer. \"He'd make a good dad.\" I say to myself as I fit my keys in the door, turn and lock it behind me. Bathroom; I have an emergency test kit in the bathroom, discarding my coat on the hanger and dumping my briefcase and bag down on the hardwood floor that is my next destination when I hear. \"Rach?\" Shit. Run before he realises your home. I try and silently unlatch the door anything not to face him right now. It's futile and I know it as a moment later he's looking right at me bemused and waiting for an answer. \"Hey.\" \"You're back early.\" I move to kiss his lips and he wraps himself around me. He smells of my favourite cologne and is wearing the sky blue sweater I bought him a week after our engagement. I nestle myself in his chest and feel the soft cotton against my cheek. My baby would love this man. Our baby would love this man. \"School was closed for inspection.\" He murmurs before deepening the kiss. When we pull apart he touches my for-head and looks concerned. \"You're sick aren't you? That's why you came home early.\" I nod as he ushers me to the couch and strokes my hair. \"Hil have to drag you kicking and screaming?\" \"Uh huh.\" \" Rachel. \" I notice his tender tone and realise the man I love has never seen me this ill before and he does not like it. \"Baby;\" He uses that word so tenderly it makes tears form in my eyes that I struggle to hold back let alone hide. \"What's wrong? Tell me honey please.\" \"Nothing's wrong.\" \"Rach.\" He holds me even more tightly as if he is afraid I'll break. \"Please. I love you Rachel. Whatever it is you can tell me.\" I turn to him confidently. \"I might be… No I am.\" \"Are you saying what I think your saying?\" He locks on me like an excited child. \"I'm pregnant Dex. We are going to have a baby.\" Before I know I'm being kissed within an inch of my life. \"You're happy?\" I gasp out between kisses as I'm being laid out on the couch. \"Happy? GOD RACHEL I feel like I'm on top of the world!\" \"Ha. I love you.\" I kiss him fiercely. \"I love you.\" He says over and over while trailing kisses the length of me and helping me shed my clothes so that only my nightdress is left. How the heck did I forget to take my sexiest nightdress off this morning? I really am pregnant. It doesn't matter as before I know it the pink satin is being lifted up and my stomach is being worshipfully stroked. \"Dexter darling what are you doing?\" He looks up at me with those brilliant eyes and says without hesitation \"Telling the baby how much I love you both.\" \"I can't wait to meet you Jellybean.\" \"You know what?

I can hardly believe that I'm about to get everything I ever wanted. I can't believe that I beat Darcy, I find myself thinking, and I wonder if Ethan's right. If I just want Dex because he's Darcy's. Was Darcy's, I correct myself. But that can't be true, not when upon hearing that he was here to see me, here to tell me that he broke it off with Darcy - because I did tell him not to talk to me otherwise - I promptly begin imagining our life together. Our house, our kids, our jobs - because I feel liberated and I decide if I'm getting the man of my dreams, why not also the job of my dreams? I hear a soft knock on the door and I glance in the mirror checking my hair and straightening my outfit. I pull the door open smiling widely, but when I see the expression on Dex's face my smile immediately drops. He looks somber, like he's delivering a death notice, not like a man that's finally going to be with the woman he loves. \"Come in,\" I say briskly, gesturing to the couch. He mumbles a thanks and I wonder when we started feeling awkward around each other. I don't like it, I don't like it at all. We sit on my couch in silence for a moment. \"So, I'm guessing you're still engaged then?\" I say, because I don't want to beat around the bush anymore. It's time to finally get this out in the open. I suppose it's my own stupid fault for thinking that anyone would choose me when they could have Darcy. It's probably also karma coming back to kick me in the ass for sleeping with my best friend's fiancé. Yup, you definitely deserve this, Rachel. And then he starts in on his speech. \"This has been a really hard decision, I really do love you. I just can't do this to Darcy.\" I find that I hate hearing her name on his lips now. \"I didn't mean to lead you on.\" Didn't mean to lead you on. The words echo in my head, the way he says it makes it seem like our relationship was all in my head, as if he hadn't been the one to utter those three blasphemous words first. He's still talking, about how he can't do this to Darcy or her family: that he cares about her too much. Cares about her? Does he even love her? I wonder, but of course I'm too afraid to ask. \"I'm really, truly sorry Rach,\" I hate that he shortens my name, how dare he call me 'Rach' when he's breaking my heart? It detracts from the gravity of the situation. \"I'll always love you,\" he's saying and something in me snaps. \"Stop,\" I say, cutting him off. He looks surprised by my interruption. \"What?\" \"Stop saying that! Stop saying you love me. Is that supposed to make it easier? Like 'Hey Rachel, I know I'm breaking your heart, but at least you can carry with you the knowledge that Dex Thaler loved you. That oughta make you feel pretty special.'\" I register the hurt in his eyes and I know I'm being a bitch, but I'm sick of being Rachel the pushover, the girl that never sticks up for herself. I'm tired of my own passive aggressive bullshit. \"Rachel, please, it's not like that,\" he's looking at me pleadingly, as if begging me to let him off the hook. To tell him 'It's okay, Dex, you go run along and be happy with Darcy.' But I wasn't going to allow him that dignification. \"What is it like then, Dex?\" I demand. \"I care about Darcy too much to do this to her.\" There he goes again saying how much he cares about her. The words were out before I can stop them. \"Do you love her?\" \"What?\" he asks, playing dumb. \"Darcy. Do you love her?\" He shifts uncomfortably on my sofa. \"She's my fiancée, Rach,\" He's dancing around the subject, not giving me a proper answer. \"Are you in love with her?\" I say it slowly enunciating each word. I tell myself I can handle this if he's in love with her. If he's in love with her and he just can't bear hurting her like this. It would still hurt like hell, but I could understand it. He would just be being the good guy I know him to be. But if he doesn't love her.. I would have to admit that he isn't who I thought he was, that he was doing this out of fear, that he was settling . Hillary would be right, he would be a coward. \"No,\" he admits, looking down at his shoes. I feel the air rushing out of me and I realize I've been holding my breath. \"You should go now, Dexter.\" There if he wants to call me 'Rach' two can play at that game; I never call him Dexter. I look into his eyes and I know he doesn't miss the subtle taunt. He gets up without saying anything and heads to the door. As he's leaving I can't resist one final gibe. \"Bye Dexter , have a nice life with the woman you care about so much.\" And then I slam the door in his face before he can respond. I know it's juvenile, but it feels like some small measure of retribution. I go into my room and crawl under the covers of the bed that Dex and I once shared and finally I let the tears fall.

At last, maybe we would get to have a conversation, like we used to, without the constant interruption Dx: That was very nice of you I wanted to let her know that I had noticed R: What? Pretending to be surprised R: Oh, please don't tell her. She'll be heartbroken I smiled; I could keep a secret, her secret. Besides it was typical of her, even on her birthday she didn't want to upset her friends. I knew she hated big parties like this, it wasn't her scene. I had tried to talk Darcy out of it but she had her heart set on throwing her best friend a party, and when she was like that nothing would stop her. It was often easier just to go along with it. Not agreeing led to far too much drama, and if there was one thing that Darcy can do well, it was drama. Dx: I won't I felt a weight on my shoulder as someone made a Doosshh sound and mock punched me. Rachel took a step back and looked shocked. Marcus, trust him to interrupt. He kept his arm around my neck, mock strangle. I closed my eyes.. M: What's going on, Dex? He kissed the side of my head and I blinked in surprise. What was the big show. We weren't that close. M: How you doing? I tried to hide my annoyance M: You gonna introduce me to the birthday girl or what? Rachel blinked and looked shy, like she couldn't believe he wanted to be introduced. I took the opportunity to try to see what she was thinking by watching her. I always liked watching her. Dx: Rachel, this is Marcus. Old family friend. Just moved into town. I looked at Marcus as he made a big production out of kissing Rachel's hand. Did he have to do that? Maybe it bothered me because it was just so far away from the way I acted. I'd never done anything like that with anyone, especially not Rachel, she was shy, cute when she was trying to hide what she thought, easily embarrassed. M: What up, birthday girl! She tried to hide her embarrassment at his flamboyance; she was also trying to shrug off any thought of being the centre of attention of all these people. R: Oh, please stop saying that M: Don't worry. The capacity to be pleasured only increases with age. I looked across at Marcus. What the hell was he saying! M: Trust me. Oh God, I had just introduced this moron to Rachel. R: Wow! Marcus saw a big busted blonde walk past and his attention was immediately diverted to trying to get her attention as he walked alongside her M: What's up? What's your name? You got a boyfriend? I couldn't believe what he was doing R: Wow I could only apologise and try to tell her that he was always like that Dx: Yeah, sorry Maybe we could have a proper conversation now Dr: HELLO! The voice cut across everyone to get their attention. Maybe not Dr: Heeelllllllloooo I watched Rachel as she turned round and moved towards the stage that Darcy was now on. I'd best leave her for the moment; maybe I'd try to catch up with her later especially if the evening took the usual run of things. Although I was hoping that she would give herself tonight off from her babysitting Darcy duties. It was her birthday and she spent enough of her social time doing it.. Her work friend Hillary stood near her as Darcy started speaking. I separated myself from the crowd watching the stage as Darcy mentioned our upcoming wedding. I felt the usual feeling on uneasiness. 61 days, was that all that was left. Where had the time gone? I felt a small clutch of panic at the future but tried to focus on the woman who was going to be my wife. Did I mention my Dad loves Darcy? He thinks that she is just what a wife should be. He sure thought that it was time I got married. I wasn't always so sure I agreed. There was a nagging doubt that I was settling, that there was something missing. Anyway, I stopped my thoughts and focused on the events going on around me, here and now. Darcy addressed me about a confession. I smiled at her joke and enjoyed the cute pictures of her and Rachel when they were younger. Then there was a picture of all three of us at graduation. I heard Darcy mention that Rachel had introduced us. I looked across at Rachel and smiled, raising my bottle as if to toast. Darcy finished her speech and I saw Rachel give a small roll her eyes at the end when Darcy mentioned that she was happy that it wasn't her yet. I prepared myself when Darcy left the stage ready to start the party. On duty. I hung back in the background watching Darcy have her fun ready to step in when it got out of hand. I knew it was time when she was dancing drunkenly on the bar. Time to go. We met Rachel as I was helping Darcy, well practically carrying Darcy to be honest, out of the club. Darcy pleaded with Rachel to let her stay. Rachel looked at me to see my reaction and for a second I wondered if she would plead Darcy's case, I just raised an eyebrow. Nope, she knew what this was like so she just let her ramble on drunkenly with her protests. She hugged and kissed Darcy, told her she loved her too at her declaration of love and lied through her teeth when questioned on if she had liked the party. Then Darcy's critical side kicked in as she laughed and talked about Rachel's shoes. Definitely time to get her out of here, particularly if she was going to start criticising the way Rachel looked. She'd do enough of that about everyone tomorrow but it was much better that her best friend didn't hear her insults. Rachel would be hurt beyond belief if she had any idea of the sorts of things that Darcy and some of her friends would say about her after a social event. I had to get her out of there before Darcy harmed their friendship. Dx: Ok, yep. Time to go home. Dr: I hate them R: Wow! Dx: You know what? She'll call you tomorrow, Rach. I started moving her towards the exit away from Rachel. Darcy still continued Dr: They're really ugly. I don't understand why you like even think I cut through her drunken slating of Rachel's choice of shoes and spoke to Rachel over my shoulder whilst still moving Dx: Yeah, Happy birthday Dr: (cont'd) I'm going to buy that pair of shoes R: Oh, thank you If we stopped we would never get home. Well – there it is, part 1. What do you think? Please let me know. Thanks.[Chapter 2] I wonder if anyone is reading this. Oh, well perhaps not. If you are, please let me know what you think. Although a lot of this is based/taken from the movie I have excluded Ethan (for this Ethan is already in England) so Rachel doesn't see Dex coming out of a cab. Dex returns to the club/bar to find Darcy's purse. R: Rachel Dx: Dex M: Marcus Chapter 2 - Dex's POV I walked back through the door. I couldn't believe I was back here again, being the dutiful boyfriend and clearing up after Darcy and her drinking. This happened a lot, lots of fun for Darcy, not so much fun for me. Rachel looked up at me as I walked in; she was sitting at the bar with a group of people, looking puzzled to see me back here R: Dex. Hey what's going on? Dx: Darcy forgot her purse R: Her new Chanel? Marcus mocked M: Oh no, not the new Chanel! C'mon shots, let's go. Rachel got up R: I'm going to help him find it M: Are you serious? R: It's like a $2000 handbag M: Dudes don't need to know stuff like that Rachel joined me in the search for the purse, we'd been looking for a while when I heard Rachel's voice R: Oh! I turned and saw Rachel crawl under a table. My eyes started to wander over her and I shook my head to focus on something else R: And voila! I walked towards her and heard her bang her head on the table R: Oh! Dx: Ha-ha-ha Dx: You all right? She looked so cute holding her hand to her head R: Mm-hm. Dx: You sure? R: Mm-hm Rachel held out the purse and I looked at her intently Dx: Thank you. Come on. I'll get you a taxi. We walked back towards the bar and Rachel reached for a glass M: C'mon Dex, man. Hang out for a minute. R: Yeah, you should stay for at least one more I was seriously tempted. I knew I should go back home but one or two drinks wouldn't hurt. It was Saturday night, it wasn't like I had to work tomorrow. I thought for a moment longer and then agreed Dx: Why not? M: That's my man Marcus was pleased and slapped me on the shoulder in approval as I joined them. We had a few more drinks and didn't really notice that everyone had peeled away and disappeared. It looked like Rachel and I were the only ones left standing. Dx: We should get a cab R: Yeah, I suppose so Her tone sounded a little reluctant but she gathered up her bags and we left. Once we got outside into the cooler night air, I stuck my arm out to try to hail a cab. Dx: So did you have a good time tonight R: Yeah I did I couldn't help it, I scoffed. Big parties like this were not really Rachel's thing, she only came to this sort of thing when she was being dragged along by one of her friends, namely Darcy. I'd lost track of the times that Darcy had complained that Rachel hadn't attended some work event or other that she or her company had been part of. Rachel preferred smaller groups, talking to people not loud clubs and bars where you often had to shout to be heard over whatever new trendy tune was playing at max volume. R: I did! Rachel sighed after her protest and I was suddenly stuck by an idea. Dx: Hey. Let's get one more drink. R: Oh no, that's okay. You don't have to Dx: Come on. I want to Rachel nodded and we walked for a bit until we found a bar. Not a cool hip place, not somewhere trying to be trendy, not somewhere dingy either. Just a normal everyday place Dx: What about here? R: Sure. Here looks good I loved that she was ok with this place. Rachel was very relaxed like that. Not everywhere was a place for her to perform. Darcy would have protested like crazy if I had tried to bring her somewhere like this. We grabbed some drinks and then slid into a booth where we chatted casually about a huge variety of things. I was having a great time, I was calm and relaxed, chatting to a beautiful girl with no interruptions when Rachel surprised me by remarking R: When was the last time we talked like this? Dx: It's been a while hasn't it? Rachel nodded, smiling brightly. She had a fantastic smile, it lit up any situation and always made me feel right with the world Dx: Maybe a little too long? She shrugged still smiling. R: Maybe that's what makes it nice She leaned back and I felt a slight tingling go through me. I tried to distract myself Dx: Another drink? Same again? Rachel nodded, still beaming that smile. I went to the bar to get our drinks, I had the vague feeling of a presence to my right but I was lost in my thoughts about having such a great time and not wanting it to be over Dx: Two Heinekens, please I grabbed both bottles and took a swig of mine as I walked back to the booth R: Wow I placed the bottle in front of Rachel and slid back into the booth R: You really don't notice the way that women look at you. I raised an eyebrow at her and wondered why Rachel had said that Dx: You're funny R: I'm not that funny Her tone sounded a little down and I was caught by a desire to make her smile again Dx: You're right, you were much funnier in law school She chuckled as I made reference to our time in law school. Her laugh washed over me, we laughed a lot back then, even when we were supposed to be seriously studying. I missed it, I missed Rachel, her laugh, her conversation, her relaxed company. R: Oh R: God if we could do anything, anything, wake up tomorrow and do anything….. R: ….be anything, what would you do? R: What would you be? I tried to avoid the question. There were so many things I wanted to do, so I made a joke Dx: Rap superstar. R: Come on, seriously. She leaned on the table, with that smile, her eyes focusing on me prompting me to give her a real answer. Dx: I'd be a teacher. R: Really? Dx: Yeah. I watched the quick look of surprise cross her face. I loved having the time to sit across from her and watch her face. It was so expressive. I felt the need to get closer so I leaned on the table and confided something I hadn't told anyone else. Dx: Yeah, I always wanted to teach. You know, maybe start with high school. I clinked our bottles together in a toast and breathed in deeply Dx: Coach the soccer team I took a another swig and leaned back again. Rachel's delicate scent was playing havoc with my insides. I felt like I was back in law school again. R: So why aren't we? Doing what we wanna to do? Dx: Well I don't know about you but Dx: Doing what I wanna do has never been much of a factor. It's more like … DX: what I am expected to do. R: Yes. Exactly. I continued to smile at Rachel and watched her take a swig from her bottle and glance up at the bar. R: Wow. We're really flipping her out. She glanced over at the bar and I followed her gaze to a woman sitting at the bar. Rachel leaned forward on the table again and lowered her voice a notch in a confiding tone. R: She can't imagine what you are doing here with me. Hot people are supposed to be with hot people I met her look thinking she was crazy. I thought about making a funny remark to her. I glanced from the girl at the bar to Rachel, who was taking another swig before looking back over to the bar again. I decided to call out to the woman Dx: Excuse me Rachel tried to stop me in her usual sweet embarrassed way. R: Dex. Shh! The girl looked over at me Dx: I think you are making my girlfriend uncomfortable over here. R: Dex. Stop it I looked at Rachel intently, and opened out my hands in protest to my innocence Dx: What? Rachel laughed as I looked back at the bar, pleased to see the girl looking flustered at being called out. Good. I didn't like that she had made Rachel feel uncomfortable, especially when we were having such a great time. R: Oh my God! Ha ha ha I looked over at Rachel and flared my eyes at her, enjoying her rich laugh and how good she looked like this. I would remember this night for a long time. I loved our closeness; it felt like it was just the two of us, in a bubble, part of the ordinary world but untouchable because we were together. I wasn't going to let anyone ruin it. R: Oh, Now I remember why I had such a crush on you in law school My heart skipped a beat at Rachel's words. She was just saying that, trying to be nice Dx: No, you didn't I looked down at the table R: Course I did Everything seemed to stop as I looked up from the table to Rachel, I felt my smile freeze a little as my heart went into overdrive. I thought everyone could hear the pounding, I certainly could. WHAT? Did I just hear right. I must be dreaming. Keep breathing, keep breathing. My whole body seemed to tingle. My world went a little fuzzy round the edges. Maybe it was the drink making me hear things but I saw Rachel shake her head R: Oh, come on. You knew. She looked right at me, as if I had known all this time. Her smile still sweet and gentle. I just stared at her. I felt like she had slapped me. Hard. My mind was whirling, thoughts racing through at a hundred miles an hour and I was completely speechless. I couldn't think of a single thing to say. I saw the smile die on her lips. Damn. We had to get out of here. I had to process this. I heard myself say Dx: I'll go get us a cab My voice sounded odd, detached, like it hadn't come from my body but I got up, went to the bar and ordered a cab. Rachel gathered her bags and I came back to the booth to collect my jacket and Darcy's purse, my mind still reeling. Think, Think damn it. Could this be true? After all this time? Should we talk about it? I was just about aware of a cab pulling up to us as I tried to get a handle on myself. I pulled open the door whilst Rachel got in. I closed it once she was safely inside amazed that my arms weren't shaking. I felt like my whole body was shaking. I got in to other side and threw Darcy's bag down on the floor. I tried to get a hold of myself, I adjusted in my seat to get comfortable. Dx: Two stops. Tenth and Second and then down to Tribeca. My body was humming with anticipation and I was trying to deal with what was happening. Breathe, be calm. You are a rational guy. I heard a small voice drift across from my right cutting into my mantra R: I'm sorry. I don't know why I … I turned my face to see Rachel looking out the window, shaking her head. My mind was screaming. Don't take it back. Don't deny what you just said. She turned towards me and started to speak again R: I was just a— Screw it I leaned over, cupping her head in my hands and cut her off by pressing my mouth to hers. The whole thing was feeling unreal. My brain stopped thinking; all I could do was feel. I was starting to pull away when I felt her respond. I looked at her for a moment, giving her the option to pull away. I heard a gorgeous moan and she closed her eyes and moved towards me to kiss me. I met her lips. I didn't know where I was and I didn't care. I just didn't want this to stop. No more thoughts just sensations, wonderful intoxicating sensations. Warmth, tingling, softness, heat. I couldn't get close enough. I was just lost in her. Her scent, her touch, her lips, her taste. It was like adding fuel to a fire, everything made me want more. More. I craved more. More. Closer. More. Driver: Yeah, all right. I'm thinking more like one stop ","Summary":" Although a lot of this is based/taken from the movie I occasionally use bits of the book.

Though her eyes were open, Elsie did not see the rows of townhouses as they crawled past her in a continuous stream of greys and browns. She blew idle wisps of white and sighed tiredly when the driver turned to ask her, for the twentieth time that hour, if she was alright. Shooing him away with a quick nod of her head and stroking the sleeping ball of browns and blacks that had taken residence in her lap, Elsie allowed herself to recline into the velvet seat and forget about the troubles that came with freedom. She wouldn't say she was unhappy with her life. No, she quite liked not having to sneak residual drinks from the cups of her 'superiors'. She'd forgotten how good it felt to spend the night idling away without thoughts of breakfast and petticoats and midnight calls for cocoa. By most standards, including her own, her life was quite enjoyable. She had fans now. And people who, like her driver, could not stand to let her attempt any task without assistance. Admittedly, she could now understand why the Sir and Lady's enjoyed to be waited on hand and foot. Twenty people at your beck and call left very little will to do anything for oneself. Yet, in an act of final defiance for the world she'd been so long intertwined in, she refused to be waited on by any other person. This, of course, did nothing to help slow the already rampant growth of rumors and wry looks amongst the supposedly civil society that seemed to follow her like an adhering stench. Sometimes, while she was still a newcomer to the strange and dazzling world of film, the time between shoots was passed listening to gossip amongst the other young actors. At the time it'd been a sort of rush for her; the American way of talking had sounded almost like a new language altogether. But she found it dull now that she had lived amongst them. She supposed it couldn't be helped; even the rumors about her supposed affairs— she liked the ones with Denton especially, because the people that spread them obviously didn't know of how many nights the man was left waiting outside her door while she dozed comfortably in her bed to a good book —had grown to be boring reiterations of the gossipers latest weekend endeavour. In some ways she preferred being a servant, though she doubted she could ever return. A servant, at least, was thought competent enough to go about their day without a constant onslaught of yelps and yells of ' cut ' and ' scene change! ' and 'make up!'. A servant was expected to do what they were told for merit that they were not of the same class as their masters. An actor, however, was master of made-believe characters and servant to the eyes of hundreds. She felt more like an animal now than she had when she had been forced to stay in the stable on a visit to one of Lady Sylvia's 'drinking buddies'. Elsie scoffed; even the horses were better company. They didn't expect her to be snobbish, or to automatically submit to whatever strange workings were in place before her arrival. The horses didn't grin smugly when she gave in, finding a comfortable spot just below what she could do and just above what others thought she could. Her bitter reminiscence was stopped by a thick, \"Milady?\" and frenzied yips from the now awake tuft of fur that bounded happily in the seat beside her, eager to run about. Casting a side glance through the square pane of glass, Elsie drifted fully out of aloof at the only form of true camaraderie she had seen in almost two years. Taking small, teetering steps from the stairs behind her, Mary was smiling brazenly. She had barely changed. \"I feel so privileged,\" Mary began, eyes shining with a spark of excitement as she rubbed her hands for warmth, \"and actress in my home! Imagine that?\" Elsie held in a laugh and brought her cigarette to her lips once more. \"What's so good about being an actress?\" she scoffed bitterly, taking another drag on her dwindling cigarette. \"I can barely take a piss without everyone knowing about it by noon.\" Mary, undeterred, shook her head and laughed. She turned briefly, bundling Pip into a sort of clump and motioning for Elsie to follow her into the humble home. There was a faint smell of fresh bread. \"Robert will—.\" \"Parks?\" Elsie interjected, though she'd long known of her friends' marriage to the murderer—man, she meant. The dark haired man. Noticing the slight look of worry on the younger girls lip, Elsie nodded towards the man with her best grin of fake affection. It came out short. She felt the way it surfaced as a thin line of displeasure. Just because she'd forgiven him didn't mean she'd forgotten. Smiling a small smile of what was supposed to be contentment to her brunette friend, Elsie walked through the oak paneled doors and stopped, relishing the familiar smell of fresh bread and some kind of polish. She loved Mary's little home. Though heavily decorated with knickknacks, it lacked the odious smell of gas and rubber. It lacked anything that reminded her of the busy world that had built itself around her. It was quiet and simple; it was Mary. Elsie frowned deeply. She's housing a murderer, she thought darkly, and she's likely still a better person than I've become. .-~ ~-. Mary was in the kitchen washing up from the light meal that they'd shared. Pip ran about, stealing nips at exposed ankles and tugging at untied shoelaces. Elsie was vaguely aware of Parks' presence in across from her, but didn't pay any real attention to him until he offered her a cigarette. \"So...\" he began coolly, slipping some meat to Pip, \"How's life treating you?\" \"Quite well, Mr. Parks.\" She felt no obligation to hold conversation with him. \"We watched your last film.\" \"Oh?\" she blew a ghost of smoke, \"Really?\" Parks nodded, \"Mary insisted.\" Briefly stopping and glancing at him with a look of uncertainty, Elsie continued to speak, \"It was a bore to film. The lines are repetitive, I felt like I'd done it a million times.\" \"Mmm...\" Tension dripped in thick globs of silence between the two until Mary returned, smiling and looking chipper as she danced around Pips bounding form. \"We saw your latest film last weekend. I loved the ending!\" she started, instantly filling the void with warm tones of excitement, \"Your character was brilliant.\" It took a moment for Elsie to remember what film she'd been talking about, what role she'd played. They'd been quite repetitive of late: either she was the unrequited lover or the sarcastic heroine. It was Weismann's favourite theme of the year; Femme Fatal , he called it. \"Thanks.\" She murmured nonchalantly, \"I've been practicing.\" Something told her this was going to be a long weekend.

It was a rainy March day in London, and Lady Trentham was fumbling with an umbrella in the open door of the motor coach. The tyres of the vehicles passing on the street sent sprays of muddy water up from the pavement, and Mary Maceachran was drenched all the quicker by one of these unwelcome fountains as she clambered out of the front of the car, clutching her hat to her head in the rain. 'One would think that, after almost two years of being in my service, you'd have gotten the hang of the timing,' muttered Lady Trentham as Mary gently took the umbrella and opened it. 'Why I haven't bothered finding a new maid is beyond me...' Mary smiled as her employer slid out of the back seat of the motor car and grabbed the maid by the arm to keep from falling. She still was a bit slow on the details, but even Lady Trentham would have to admit that she had made remarkable improvements since her first year as a lady's maid. She was far from being a perfect servant – anticipation was not, and likely would never be, her strongest suit – but she knew she was better than competent. And while Lady Trentham complained about her constantly in sotto voce soliloquies, Mary knew that she wouldn't be sacked any time soon; not only was she now a better-than-adequate servant, but she could tell that Lady Trentham liked her for her sincerity and her discretion, and her willingness to relate bits of gossip from the servants' quarters for the lady's enjoyment. Besides, when it came to salary, she was still dirt cheap. 'My goodness , Sylvia certainly has done well for herself!' exclaimed Lady Trentham, blinking up at the stately white Pembridge Square townhouse under the gray sky. 'Just like her, of course – her husband not yet a year and a half dead in the ground, and she's already gone and bought a fashionable residence in Kensington.' Mary nodded politely and followed Lady Trentham up the steps of the house, holding the old woman's elbow to support her. 'I must say, I'm actually rather shocked she hasn't invited me before now,' continued Lady Trentham, puffing a bit as she ascended the steps. 'But I suppose she's been a bit busy, what with selling Gosford Park and wrapping up matters with the police, and then that whole dreadful business with Isobel... disgraceful.' 'Well, my lady, Miss Isobel had had a trying time of things,' said Mary cautiously, 'what with her father's death, and then her childhood home being sold.' 'Yes, and with all of that hullabaloo going on, the very last thing she needed to do was run away.' Lady Trentham sniffed haughtily as they paused at the door. 'Still, as long as she doesn't mar the family name too much before she returns, I suppose we shall just have to accept things as they are.' Just before Lady Trentham thought to suggest it, Mary rapped on the door and stood back, waiting for Jennings to open it. Instead, when the latch was slid back with a clack and the door swung open, she found herself face to face with Robert Parks. 'Oh!' cried Mary in surprise, feeling a curious rush flow over her – fear and excitement mixed together at the sight of the dashing would-be murderer. 'Hello,' he said gently, an equally surprised but very pleased expression flitting across his face. 'Well, pray don't just stand there in the door frame; it's rather wet out here!' snapped Lady Trentham, elbowing her way inside. 'Sylvia? Sylvia, are you in?' 'I didn't know you'd be here,' said Mary shyly as Robert joined her under the umbrella and the two descended the stairs to fetch Lady Trentham's trunk. 'I thought Her Ladyship said that Lady Sylvia and Lady Louisa hadn't spoken since...' 'They haven't,' replied Robert with a grunt as he tugged the trunk out of the boot of the motor coach and tipped his hat to the driver. 'Nor have they seen each other at all. Lady Stockbridge was dead-set against this gathering from the moment the invitation arrived, but Lord Stockbridge had business in London and so decided they were going to come anyway.' 'Then they've made up?' 'The sisters?' Robert let out a brief laugh. 'My god, no. Lady Louisa is still furious that Lady Sylvia didn't shed a tear when her husband died, and went riding the next morning instead. By the way, someone forgot to unlock the gate down to the area, and I haven't had time to go tell them to unlock it; we'll have to go through the house to get downstairs.' Mary nodded and followed Robert back towards the front door of the house. 'And Lady Sylvia?' 'Furious with Lady Louisa for treating Sir William's death with \"a display worthy of an Italian opera.\" ' Robert smirked slightly at the follies of England's upper-class. 'It's a shame.' 'It's not, really. Lady Louisa has to be a bit happier, now that no-one else can have the man she always wanted; Lady Sylvia's almost certainly happier without Sir William around to pounce on all the maids in sight.' Robert nearly slipped on the steps, but Mary seized his arm with the hand that did not hold the umbrella, and steadied him. 'Thanks. By the way, I assume you've heard about your friend from Gosford Park?' 'Elsie?' Mary smiled. 'Of course I did! Isn't it exciting?' 'Certainly a step up from sneaking about in dark corners with Sir William. You been to see it?' Mary shook her head. 'Have you?' 'Not yet.' Robert glanced at Mary. 'Care to go tonight, if we can?' Mary shook out the umbrella and closed it slowly. 'Really?' 'I think we could convince Jennings and Mrs Wilson to find suitable replacements for a few hours.' Robert shrugged. 'It'd be worth a go.' A shiver had gone up Mary's spine at the mention of Mrs Wilson; presumably, if Lady Sylvia and Lady Louisa hadn't seen each other in the year since Sir William's death, then Robert hadn't seen Mrs Wilson either. 'Have you talked to either of them yet?' 'Not yet,' repeated Robert, holding the door open for her. 'I only just brought in Lord Stockbridge's things; that's why I was at the door in the first place. I don't know if the servants are even expecting us, but I'm sure they'll find somewhere to put us. Can you manage the trunk?' 'Yes, of course.' Mary took Lady Trentham's trunk from Robert so he could collect Lord Stockbridge's items; their hands brushed momentarily as the trunk was handed over. 'Thank you, Mr Parks.' 'It's Robert,' he insisted. 'And can I call you Mary?' Mary looked at him earnestly. 'Unless you want to worry about pronouncing \"Maceachran,\" yes.' Lady Sylvia was resplendent in her new environs, dressed in day clothes far more flattering than her former riding wear (she had given up trousers and horses alike quite readily for the chance to become a proper London socialite). 'Aunt Constance, it's wonderful to see you,' she exclaimed, a curl of cigarette smoke escaping from her lips as she embraced Lady Trentham in the parlour. 'I'm so glad that at least you and Louisa could make it.' 'Yes, yes,' replied Lady Trentham with disinterest, folding herself into a chair. 'But dear Lavinia won't be here?' 'Unfortunately not.' Lady Sylvia too collapsed onto a chair with a practiced carelessness. 'Anthony and Freddie have entered into some ridiculous business over in Sudan – selling shoes, or something of that nature – and heaven knows how, but it's apparently flourishing. They're constantly running off to Africa to deal with business matters, and Lavinia fawns after Anthony so slavishly now that she always insists on going with him.' 'Really.' Lady Trentham scowled slightly. 'I don't remember them being that close at all before.' 'For some reason, ever since – you know, that week – they've been thick as thieves together, absolutely inseparable.' Lady Sylvia took another drag on her cigarette. 'That Mabel, though, she follows Freddie to make sure he doesn't get up to anything in her absence. Wouldn't put it past him, especially with a shabby wife like he's got.' 'Presumably by now, he's been able to get her at least one more dress, though,' said Lady Trentham wryly, and the two women snorted with laughter behind their hands. 'What a week that was!' exclaimed Lady Trentham through her residual chuckles. 'I suppose it might be a blessing that only I and Louisa and Raymond could make it this weekend, though. At least we won't have to worry about any American pretenders this time... nor phone calls back to Los Angeles every three seconds, for that matter.' 'Yes,' sighed Lady Sylvia, and for a moment she looked a bit wistful. 'But of course I'll have some neighbours and friends over for dinner, liven things up a bit.' 'Indeed.' Lady Trentham did not look entirely approving. Lady Sylvia raised a manicured eyebrow. 'Well, you can't expect me to wander about this house by myself night and day, can you, Aunt Constance?' she cried. 'Not with William dead, and Isobel run off to God-knows-where. I moved to London to meet some new people, you know, and I've been quite good at it.' 'So I'd imagine,' quipped Lady Trentham dryly. 'Where is Louisa? She certainly is taking her time with getting prepared.' 'She only got here a few moments before you,' Lady Sylvia explained. ' And she arrived without a lady's maid. Apparently, her latest one quit a few days ago, without warning – well, I suppose with Louisa's fits of emotion, it must be terribly difficult to stay sane around her. They're getting rather desperate, you know; she hasn't been able to maintain a single lady's maid for more than four months since Bill died.' 'Well, what is she going to do about it?' 'God only knows. If only money were enough incentive to keep a lady's maid around these days.' 'Hm. Well, I suppose Louisa can use one of your maids, at least while she's here,' said Lady Trentham with a shrug. At that moment, a laugh emanated from the hallway, and both heads turned as Mary and Robert walked by the door, deep in conversation and clearly quite oblivious to anything but one another. 'I say, isn't that Raymond's man?' said Lady Sylvia with some interest. 'I dare say it was,' grumbled Lady Trentham. 'Well, then, Aunt Constance,' said Lady Sylvia briskly, snubbing out her cigarette in an ashtray near her elbow, 'perhaps you should consider letting your maid take care of Louisa for the weekend. For all we know, the arrangement may become permanent.' As at Gosford Park – and, indeed, at all of the houses in England that respected the tenets of 'gracious living' – the servants' quarters in the Kensington townhouse were upstairs in the garret just below the roof, whilst all of the cooking and washing was carried out below stairs; a rickety set of wooden steps at the back of the house discreetly connected these two levels so that the servants could manoeuvre up and down without disturbing their employers. Mary went first in the ground floor corridor, descending the stairs to the kitchen with care so that she did not scrape up Lady Trentham's leather trunk against the unforgiving walls. Mrs Croft and her girls were already hard at work preparing dinner, and Mary was shocked to see that the irascible cook was handling the presence of the commanding Mrs Wilson in the kitchen with good grace. ' I haven't seen Dorothy, you might want to check her room,' Mrs Croft was grumbling with far less ire than Mary remembered, as she chopped carrots for a stew. 'Or Jennings's room,' sniggered one of the kitchen girls quietly, until a sharp glare from Mrs Wilson shut her up quickly. 'Well, if you do see her, Mrs Croft, please let me know immediately, as soon enough, the guests...' Mrs Wilson paused as she noticed Mary, and turned back to Mrs Croft. 'Excuse me, as this very instant , the guests are arriving. Miss Trentham, how have you been?' she concluded, turning back towards Mary. 'Very well, thank you, Mrs Wilson,' replied Mary with a nod of acknowledgement. 'Second floor, first bedroom on the left; and you'll be all the way on the fourth floor, sharing with Dorothy,' Mrs Wilson directed, flipping through a stack of papers. Mary became aware that Mrs Croft had stopped chopping, and she saw when she glanced up that the cook was staring in amazement at Robert, who nodded with some bemusement. 'And as for you...' Mrs Wilson began, looking up and halting mid-sentence as she noticed Robert. 'Oh! Mr Stockbridge...' She glanced down quickly, as if motivated to consult her list again, although Mary suspected otherwise. 'I'm afraid we weren't expecting you.' 'I'm afraid we weren't expecting to be here ourselves,' replied Robert, setting down his trunk and pulling off his hat. 'My apologies, Mrs Wilson. I hope you'll be able to manage...' 'Yes, yes, of course,' responded Mrs Wilson distractedly. 'I'm sure we'll find somewhere, we only have to house Lady Trentham and as many local guests who wish to stay the night, after all. If you'll excuse me...' Without another look in their direction, Mrs Wilson strode from the kitchens. Robert and Mary looked at each other, he with amusement, she with barely-concealed worry. 'Well, it seems that the meticulous Mrs Wilson isn't at her best when caught off her guard,' he joked. 'Leave her be, Mr Parks,' said Mrs Croft quietly as she resumed her chopping. 'Just give her a few moments to sort things out in her head.' Robert raised his eyebrows at Mary, and the two turned around to go deposit Lady Trentham's things in her assigned room. 'Do you think she's too off her balance to approve our going to the film?' Robert muttered as they emerged back into the first floor corridor. Mary shook her head. 'I'll go ask her later, after she's gotten things sorted out,' she said. 'There's Jennings,' said Robert as the manservant appeared from up the front staircase. 'I'll find you later.' Mary nodded and continued up the back stairwell with Lady Trentham's trunk as Robert accosted Jennings and, with minimal preliminary niceties, made ready to bargain for a few hours off. Mrs Croft knew she would find her sister seated on her bed, staring down at a list of rooms and servants as she was. 'It all depends on whether or not the Willoughbys decide to stay the night after all, rather than riding the extra half hour back home,' she fretted as Mrs Croft closed the door behind her. 'The Crawfords will almost certainly end up staying – they always do – and then the Morgenthaus...' She broke off, her hands shaking slightly as she placed the list down next to her, not looking at Mrs Croft as she sat down on the bed. 'Ah, well,' Mrs Wilson sighed. 'Anticipation can only help a person plan so far in advance, I suppose.' 'Are you going to talk to him?' asked Mrs Croft bluntly and without preamble. Mrs Wilson looked down at her hands. 'No,' she said softly. 'No?' repeated Mrs Croft incredulously, raising her eyebrows. 'For pity's sake, Jane, you've been given a second chance! Don't waste it this time!' 'A second chance for what?' snapped Mrs Wilson, rising from the bed and going to stand by the dingy window, with her back towards her sister. 'To let him see that his mother dedicated her life to the man who made her give up her child? No, better to let him think she died all those years ago, and died a free woman. He would be ashamed to see me for what I am.' She smiled bitterly. 'The perfect servant. The one who decided to keep her servitude and give him up, rather than the other way around.' 'Jane.' Mrs Croft pushed herself to her feet and seized Mrs Wilson by the shoulders. 'He won't care. He deserves to know the truth.' When Mrs Wilson did not respond, Mrs Croft continued in an increasingly vitriolic whisper. 'Do you know what I'd give to have one more day with my boy, just one ? And here you have the chance to be with yours for the rest of a lifetime , to see him get married and grow old, to play with your grandchildren, to know that things have turned out all right even when you didn't expect them to. Don't you know what I would give for that?' Mrs Wilson tore herself from her sister's grasp with a sob. 'I can't,' she cried in a muffled voice, and rushed from the room. Mrs Croft tossed her hat to the floor angrily, her entire lanky frame shaking; then, after a few calming breaths, she collected herself and her hat, and slowly descended the creaking back steps down to the kitchens. Mary seemed to have a knack for getting lost in unfamiliar houses. She was fairly certain she was somewhere on the second floor – or was it the third? – but she couldn't seem to find a room that would accommodate Lady Trentham in the manner that Her Ladyship would surely expect. A grandfather clock chimed behind her, and as she turned to look at it, she walked straight into Mrs Wilson coming round a corner. 'Oh! I'm sorry, Mrs Wilson,' she said. 'No trouble, Miss Trentham,' sniffed Mrs Wilson, almost as though she had just been crying. 'Are you lost?' 'I'm afraid so,' said Mary sheepishly. 'Well, you'd better come with me, then,' said Mrs Wilson, brushing past Mary, who followed quickly. 'It seems like there are so few people here,' Mary observed. 'Did Lady Sylvia get rid of some of her servants?' 'Yes. There was no point in keeping so many; this house, as you can see, is considerably smaller than Gosford Park, and now there is only one inhabitant who needs constant service, rather than three.' Mrs Wilson was struck by a moment of nostalgia as she remembered some of the old familiar faces who had been dismissed – George, Probert, of course Elsie. She hoped they'd all landed on their feet somewhere or another. 'But the guests tonight will bring more servants, I dare say; and, if not, I think we'll be able to manage. They never need much personal attention during these dinner events, not until it's time to go to bed.' Mary let a moment or two pass in silence. 'I was wondering, Mrs Wilson,' she said finally, 'if I might have an hour or two off tonight.' 'And why is that, Miss Trentham?' 'Well, as you said, the guests won't need much personal attention until they turn in for the night, which likely won't be until midnight or so. And Robert... Mr Stockbridge, that is, invited me to go see the Charlie Chan movie that Mr Weissman produced – you know, Mr Denton and Elsie are starring in it together.' 'Are they?' said Mrs Wilson, who had stopped for a moment on the staircase at the mention of Mr Stockbridge's name. 'Yes. And much of it was modeled on... you know, that night.' 'Hm.' Mrs Wilson glanced back at Mary over her shoulder, then continued along the next corridor. 'Well, I suppose we'll find someone to cover for the both of you. Most likely, neither Lady Trentham nor Lord Stockbridge will notice you've gone at all. You know how to get to the theatre?' 'I couldn't say, but Mr Stockbridge grew up in London, he knows the Tube well enough.' 'Just be careful, both of you, and be sure you're back before eleven, that's when the guests should start needing attention again.' Mrs Wilson stopped before an elegant bedroom suite. 'Lady Trentham's.' She paused. 'You'll be glad to know we've plenty of homemade marmalade this time. I made sure of it when I heard you would be here.' 'Thank you, Mrs Wilson,' smiled Mary as the housekeeper departed quickly down the corridor. By half past ten that night, Robert and Mary were already back from the film and emerging from the Notting Hill Gate Tube station, arm in arm. 'I still can't believe it was Elsie!' Mary exclaimed with a laugh. 'Miss Elsa Buchanan, it said her name was, in the credits, all formal like that.' 'And that Denton, too. Changed his name, you'll have noticed – I suppose they all change their names in Hollywood, though. Not that I'd put it past him that his name never was Denton in the first place.' 'Well, still, it was all good fun.' The rain had long since stopped, but Mary still snuggled closer to Robert to avoid the chill. 'Thank you for inviting me.' 'It was my pleasure.' Robert grinned. 'If you should thank anyone, it's Mrs Wilson for giving you the evening off.' 'Yes.' Mary thought of Mrs Wilson, with her obedient manner and perhaps a bottle of poison up her sleeve, and shivered. 'Are you all right?' asked Robert kindly. Mary shook her head slowly. 'I kept on thinking,' she said in a low voice, 'throughout the movie, about Sir William's death, and...' She shuddered. Robert stopped walking and took her gently by the hands. 'Are you afraid of me, Mary?' Mary stared at him with watery eyes. 'Well, no, but...' 'I swear to you, here and now,' Robert said sincerely, 'that, aside from him, I would never harm another creature on God's earth.' He laughed. 'I don't even like shooting , however much Lord Stockbridge does!' 'But, you stabbed him, Robert!' said Mary, her voice cracking with tears. 'Didn't make any difference, the bastard was already dead.' 'You still meant to do it, though.' Mary bit her lower lip. 'If he hadn't been dead already, you'd have killed him.' 'But I didn't.' There was a tone of finality in Robert's voice that made Mary stop crying. 'I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't. There now, you see? I'm not a murderer, the police can't arrest me, and so help me, I'll never hurt so much as a fly from now on. Does that make you feel better?' Mary sniffed. 'A bit, yes.' 'Good.' Robert's hands moved slowly up Mary's arms to her shoulders, and he brushed lightly at a tear with his fingers. 'I don't think I could bear it if you hated me.' And before Mary knew it, they were kissing each other, not in the privacy of the servants' quarters at Gosford Park, but out under a streetlamp on a Kensington street whose wet pavement gleamed silver in the lamplight. 'Mary,' Robert murmured, staring into her eyes, 'I think...' 'I know,' she whispered. 'But it's foolish of us. Do these things ever work out?' Robert shrugged. 'Who knows? Lady Louisa needs a new lady's maid. Things might work out yet. And even if they don't, we don't need to remain servants forever, we could find other jobs.' He took her hands again. 'I promise you, I'm not like my father was. I won't even attempt to put you in any sort of position that might compromise your job with Lady Trentham. I... I don't think I could bear it if you ended up like my mother.' Mary kissed him again softly on the cheek, and then looked down at the ground. 'Robert,' she said quietly, 'there's something I think you should know.' Inside, Mary gave Robert's hand a quick squeeze before she darted upstairs to put Lady Trentham's things in order. 'Ah, Mary,' exclaimed Lady Trentham, entering the room with her usual air of self-importance only seconds after Mary finished unpacking. ' What an evening it's been! Sylvia and Louisa wouldn't even look at each other all through dinner, even with Sylvia insisting on flirting with Raymond in the most absurd manner. And then, after dinner, while everyone else was milling about and playing cards and the like, the two of them – Sylvia and Louisa, I mean – went into the library and obviously had a dreadful row, because shortly after, Louisa came storming out of the library in tears, and no amount of rebukes or eye-rolling from Raymond could keep her from leaving the party.' 'Do you know what the fight was about?' asked Mary, carefully removing Lady Trentham's jewellery. 'Oh, probably William, that's all they've ever fought about, is William,' replied Lady Trentham disinterestedly before turning around in her chair with a much more serious expression. 'Now, Mary, I want you to answer me truthfully.' 'Of course, my lady.' 'My niece Louisa – Lady Stockbridge, to you – is looking for a new lady's maid, and I have a hunch that she's going to be asking you if you want the position before the weekend is out.' 'Me?' asked Mary, dropping an earring on the floor in her amazement. 'Pick that up, Mary; yes, you.' Lady Trentham sniffed. 'Sylvia thinks that Louisa has the means of luring you away from me, in the form of that valet of Raymond's. But you don't like him all that much, do you?' 'My lady...' Mary flushed pink and quickly turned to put the jewelry in the armoire and fetch Lady Trentham's dressing gown. 'Yes, I feared as much,' sighed Lady Trentham somewhat petulantly. 'And you would really leave me all by myself in my lonely manor, with no-one but the butler and the gardeners to talk to?' 'I can't rightly say, my lady,' said Mary cautiously as she handed over the dressing gown. 'Besides, Lady Louisa hasn't even made me an offer yet. I don't think it's possible for me to know what I'd say until she does.' Lady Trentham sighed again, rather melodramatically. 'Oh, well, let me know when she does, so I can go write up an advertisement for a new lady's maid. That will be all for tonight, Mary – I'll call you if I need you.' 'Yes, my lady,' said Mary obediently, allowing herself a real smile as soon as she had left the room. Mrs Wilson sat at the small table in her room, double-checking the supply lists for the past month by the light of a small lamp, when a knock sounded on her door. 'Yes?' she said without looking up, assuming it would be Dorothy with some problem or another. The door creaked open, and into the room stepped Robert Parks, who closed the door behind him carefully and stared at Mrs Wilson in an almost unnerving manner. 'I'm sorry to bother you at this hour of the night, Mrs Parks,' he said softly. 'Mr Stockbridge.' Mrs Wilson's mouth had gone dry, but she tried to resume her work in as normal a manner as possible. 'I trust Jennings informed you where your...' She froze, staring at her list. 'I'm sorry, what did you say?' 'I believe that is your name,' said Robert, sitting down in the chair opposite her and folding his hands on the table. 'It was,' she replied softly, 'a long time ago.' She glanced quickly up at Robert, but found that she couldn't meet his gaze for long. 'Who told you?' 'Mary. She told me everything. Is it true?' Mrs Wilson breathed out slowly and collected the lists into a neat pile. 'You've not given me much to confirm or deny.' 'You're my mother? And he made you give me up so you could keep your job, and told you I'd go to a family who wanted me?' Mrs Wilson nodded mutely. 'Jesus.' Robert leaned back in his chair and stared moodily off into space. 'The lying bastard.' Half a smile twitched on Mrs Wilson's lips, then disappeared. 'And you killed him, too.' Robert looked back at Mrs Wilson, whose attention still seemed focused on the table. ' You poisoned him, so I couldn't be blamed for his death. Why...?' 'Isn't that what any mother would do for her son?' said Mrs Wilson in a tight voice, rising to put away the supply lists. 'But you couldn't even be sure it was me!' 'I knew it was.' 'How?' 'That photograph.' Mrs Wilson turned, a slightly wistful smile playing across her features. 'I still can't believe that survived all these years.' Robert pulled the photograph from an inner pocket of his coat and slid it across the table to her. 'It was in my file. At the orphanage,' he explained as Mrs Wilson examined her twenty-year-old face. 'They told me you were dead.' 'Well, they weren't far off the mark,' she sighed, sitting down and sliding the photograph back to Robert. She still could not meet his eyes. 'Can you ever forgive me?' 'For what? For believing his lies?' 'For giving you up in the first place.' Mrs Wilson's face contorted and she could no longer control her sobs, although she tried to conceal them with her hands. 'It was without a doubt the biggest mistake of my life.' 'Oh,' said Robert huskily, moving hastily around the table and gently pulling Mrs Wilson's hands away from her face. 'No, of course I don't blame you. I... I just always wanted to know who you were, and what you were like.' 'I hope I don't disappoint you too much,' Mrs Wilson managed to say apologetically, swallowing another shuddering sob. 'No, not at all,' Robert said with absolute candor. 'But weren't you ever going to tell me?' Mrs Wilson steadied her breathing. 'I was afraid you'd hate me for everything.' Robert shook his head, but she pressed on. 'Besides, what good would it do for you to know? It's not like time can ever be recovered...' And Mrs Wilson thought of those long thirty years, and how every now and then, she would think about her boy and how old he would be (if he were still alive) and what he might be doing at eight years old – learning to ride a horse for the first time, perhaps; or twelve – sitting in a classroom with his primer before him on the desk, bored to death; or twenty – courting some charming young lady. Such lovely fantasies they'd been... until she came to Gosford Park and learned the truth about where her son had gone. 'No,' agreed Robert, kneeling down a bit so that his face was level with hers, 'but there's time enough to become well-acquainted now. I know I was distant at Gosford Park, but I'm not really like that, it was more because...' 'Yes.' Mrs Wilson nodded shakily. 'Not to mention, you were watching me like a hawk. I thought you knew what I was up to.' And now Mrs Wilson remembered that week at Gosford Park, and how she had cherished and stowed away in minute detail each memory of every encounter with Robert, the way a lover stashes away love letters to review in secret. She could see why he might have been intimidated by her then, why he'd kept his distance. 'I did know,' she said. 'Yes, of course you did,' laughed Robert quietly. 'You don't miss much.' Mrs Wilson gently pulled one of her hands from where Robert held them, and haltingly reached out to touch his cheek. He didn't flinch, and she drew in a shuddering breath. 'But I have, I've missed so much,' she whispered, tears filling her eyes again, and the next moment she had seized Robert in her arms and was crying into his shoulder, holding him as though she would never let go. 'Oh, my boy...' Robert returned her embrace, trying and failing to keep back his own tears. The two clung to each other for a long moment, reunited and yet somehow still terribly lost. 'Does anyone besides Mary know?' Robert asked softly. 'Just Mrs Croft.' Mrs Wilson sat back to look at Robert and sniffed. 'My sister. She won't tell; we've kept each other's secrets all our lives. But I think Mary must be the only other one.' She smiled grimly. 'I dare say Scotland Yard would have arrested me a long time ago if they had put all the pieces together themselves.' 'You needn't worry; the case is officially closed by now.' Robert frowned. 'Something about some toxic cleaning substance getting into one of the tumblers while the crystal and silver were being cleaned, and a highwayman of sorts breaking in and stabbing him as he was writhing from the poison.' 'I'm not surprised,' said Mrs Wilson with a slight smirk. 'That inspector was the most incompetent man I've ever seen.' 'Well, at least you'll be safe now.' 'That was never my main concern.' A brief pause as Mrs Wilson looked back down at her hands. 'Can I ask you something?' Robert paused. 'Why did you stay with him? After he had betrayed you like that?' Mrs Wilson sighed and leaned back in her chair, clasping her hands before her on the table top. Robert stood and reseated himself in the chair across the table, never looking away from her. 'When he was young, Sir William was handsome and almost unbelievably charismatic. That was how he charmed all the factory girls in the first place, of course. My sister and I were some of his first workers; his workplace policies weren't solidly formed until after the first year, when the evidence of his mismanagement could no longer be ignored. Anyway, Lizzie's son was born first – he died a few years later, poor thing – and mine only a few months later, and since she'd already been sacked, I decided I'd have to stay on, to support our parents. And, having made that choice, it became a habit of sorts, staying on with him.' Mrs Wilson smiled grimly. 'He trusted me. He had no real reason, but he did, and I let him. Ended up being the death of him, of course.' 'So it wasn't love then.' 'Hardly,' said Mrs Wilson with a bleak laugh. 'And I suppose I always did entertain a fantasy that you'd come back one day, even when I didn't know if you were even alive.' 'Well, here I am.' Mrs Wilson smiled falteringly as she reached one hand across the table and laid it on Robert's. 'Here you are,' she repeated softly. Both looked away for an instant. 'But, of course, no-one can know,' Mrs Wilson said finally, withdrawing her hand. 'You'll remain Mr Stockbridge, and I'll remain Mrs Wilson, and we'll interact on perfectly cordial terms.' 'Of course,' said Robert with a slight grin. 'I'll come visit you, though, so long as it's not too obvious.' 'Well, I imagine the Stockbridges must have occasion to send a servant into London now and again.' Mrs Wilson eyed her grown son. 'And what are you going to do about that Mary, Lady Trentham's maid?' Robert raised his eyebrows. 'It's that obvious?' 'I could remind you that I don't miss much, but yes, it is, Mr Stockbridge. Have you thought about trying to get her positioned as Lady Stockbridge's maid?' 'Something of that nature.' Robert shrugged. 'If worst comes to worst, I could always seek employment outside of valeting.' Mrs Wilson nodded. 'She's a good girl, that one. Sharp, too. Notices a lot, but keeps her mouth closed, unless she needs confirmation on some matter of importance.' 'Another Mrs Wilson in the making, then?' joked Robert. 'On the contrary,' Mrs Wilson smiled, 'another Mrs Parks.' Robert looked down in embarrassment and shrugged. 'We'll see.' 'Good luck to you both,' said Mrs Wilson softly, rising from her chair. 'You'd best go now, Mr Stockbridge, it's late.' 'Please,' said the valet, likewise standing and looking fondly down upon his mother as he did so, 'call me Robert in private, will you.' 'Yes, well, then, good night, Robert,' said Mrs Wilson, trying to sound business-like and failing. She took a step forward to open the door for him, but he stopped her. 'Good night, Mum,' he said quietly, giving her a quick kiss on the forehead before opening the door for himself and exiting with a gentle click of the lock behind him. Mrs Wilson stood alone in the dim light of the table lamp, trembling from emotions too complex to enumerate. Comforted by the solitude, she closed her eyes and allowed tears to course down her face, until she finally felt composed once more. Only then did she notice that Robert had left the old photograph on the table, and at first she wondered if she should call after him; but then she took it up and carefully laid it in the drawer of her bed stand. Perhaps Robert didn't feel he needed the photograph any more, now that it no longer held within it all he'd ever know about his mother... and if he did still want it, he'd know where to come looking for it from now on. She smiled to herself, and turned off the lamp.

Most of the patients did call her by her Christiannname, because she'd asked them to, but she knew that the man innthat bed had just been admitted to the hospital, after having had hisnleft leg amputated in a field unit. Besides, she hadn't met himnyet, so how could he know her name at all? Except...she thought shenknew that voice, even though, if she was correct, she hadn't heardnit for nine years. She turned slowly to face him. \"Rupert?\" she said, though therenwas no question, really. She'd carried that face in her mind fornalmost a decade, and even through the grime and the pain, she knewnit. It wasn't a classically handsome face - it never had been -nbut that hadn't mattered to her nine years ago, and it didn'tnmatter now. \"I knew that had to be you,\" hensaid, his voice hoarse, not at all the smooth softness shenremembered. \"No one else ever walked the way you did.\" Isobel gasped. He remembered the waynshe walked? She took the remaining few steps over to his bedside,nbut then she just stood there, not sure what to say. Almost of theirnown free will, her eyes traveled over his body, professionallynmarking his clinical status. He looked a little pale, but that wasnto be expected, after the ordeal he'd just gone through, and henwasn't breathing heavily or sweating. When her eyes reached thenplace where his left leg should have been, though, they stopped,nIsobel the woman taking over from Isobel the nurse. \"I'm so sorry, Rupert,\" shencouldn't help but say, even though the Rupert she had known wouldnnever have wanted her sympathy. As she expected, he just gave her ancomical grimace. \"Just gives me an excuse not tondance,\" he said. \"You remember how horrible I always was.\" His smile, cheeky and brave, almostnbroke her heart. It was hard enough seeing that smile on her othernpatients; on Rupert, it made her want to scream. He must have noticed how she felt,nbecause he stopped smiling. \"Would you...would you sit down?\" henasked. \"It's been so long...I'd love to catch up.\" Isobel opened her mouth to refuse;nshe'd just been about to go off duty, and she'd made annalmost-date to meet Aunt Lavinia at the Red Cross to knit socks. ButnRupert needed her - she could see that quite clearly - and she'dnnever been able to resist that. Well, she had once, but only thatnonce. Besides, Aunt Lavinia would understand. She nodded, thennlooked around for a chair to pull over to the side of the bed. Therenwas just barely enough room in between the beds for a chair, so thennurses had long ago decided to keep them elsewhere, until they needednto sit down. The patient in the bed on the other side of her was annerve gas victim, and he was asleep, which made Isobel happy, becausenhe hadn't been sleeping much. She didn't see any chairs nearby,nand she was about to go in search of one, when she felt Rupert'snhand on her arm. \"Sit here,\" he said, gesturing tonthe place where his leg should have been. \"See, it's good fornsomething.\" Tears welled up in her eyes, and shensat quickly, so she could use the excuse of arranging her skirts oncenshe had to hide the time she needed to blink them away. \"Thank you,\" she said. \"No, thank you,\" Rupert said. n\"You don't know how wonderful it is to see you. For a moment, Inthought I'd died falling out of that airplane, instead of justnlosing a leg.\" \"Don't joke about it,\" Isobelnsaid, closing her eyes against more threatening tears. This isnridiculous, she thought. Why are you getting so emotionalnabout a man you haven't seen in years? \"I'm sorry,\" Rupert said. \"Inwon't, if it makes you uncomfortable.\" He paused for a moment,nthen chuckled. \"You always were so...so earnest. Do you stillnplay cards the same way?\" \"What do you mean?\" she asked, butnthe tears were gone, chased away by the smile she'd always feltnaround him. \"Don't tell me you'venforgotten,\" he said. \"You don't remember me teasing you thatnyou played cards as though your life depended on it?\" She did smile at that, though shenwouldn't meet his eyes. She remembered. Oh, did she evernremember. He'd said that just two days before...before her lifenfell apart. She didn't want to remember that. \"I haven't played cards fornawhile,\" she said, watching her fingers fold her skirt into pleats. \"I suppose not,\" Rupert said. n\"Erm...how have you been?\" \"Oh, fine,\" she said, stillnwatching her hands. Well, it wasn't exactly a lie. \"I saw the notice that yourngreat-aunt passed away. I'm sorry, Isobel.\" \"Oh,\" she said, looking upnfinally. \"Thank you, but...I'm glad Aunt Constance died beforenall of this.\" She waved a hand at the hospital, the Blitz, thenwar, the world. \"She would have...well, I don't know what shenwould have done.\" \"I'm certain she would havenmanaged,\" Rupert said, touching her arm with his hand, \"but shenwouldn't have been happy, so I can understand why you feel thatnway.\" Isobel nodded, holding his gaze so shenwouldn't look down at his hand on her arm. She could feel it - hernevery nerve tingled with it - but maybe if she didn't look at it,nhe'd leave it there. It felt right, in a way that nothing had fornnine years. \"And...how is the rest of yournfamily? Lady Stockbridge, Mrs. Meredith, your mother?\" \"Mother is...well, Mother is well,\"nshe said feeling the slightly twisted smile on her lips that wasnalways there when she thought of her mother. \"She's a bitndisappointed that the war is keeping her from the Riviera, but she'snmanaging. I think she's visiting friends in Scotland right now. nWe don't speak often.\" She stopped, before she said too much. nShe knew that her mother was as disappointed in her as she was withnher mother. \"Aunt Lavinia is here in town, helping wherever shencan. Uncle Anthony doesn't want her to be here, of course, but sheninsists, and he can't say no to her. He's in the War Office, ofncourse, helping with evacuation procedures.\" \"They were such a lovely couple,\"nRupert said, his voice so quiet that she had to lean towards him tonhear. \"So in love.\" \"Yes,\" Isobel said. She'd nevernbeen anything but happy for her Aunt Lavinia, who had found a trulynloving husband, but she'd also always been a bit envious, a feelingnthat hadn't diminished, even in nine years. She rushed on, so shenwouldn't think about it. \"Two of their sons are at the front,nand the third is reading everything he can get his hands on aboutnfighter planes. And yet, Aunt Lavinia manages to be cheerful, andnwork so hard...\" She trailed off, and after a moment, felt his handnpat her arm. \"How is Lady Stockbridge?\" henasked. \"She's fine, too. She and UnclenRaymond are at Sweetbriars, which they've basically turned into anconvalescent home for soldiers. I never would have thought AuntnLouisa had it in her, but she's doing wonderful work. I...I had tonapologize to her.\" She bit her lip after she'd said that,nbecause she certainly hadn't meant to. \"Why?\" Rupert asked. Isobel couldnhear the ready laughter in his voice, but far from resenting it, itnactually made her comfortable. She knew that he would understand, nonmatter what she told him. \"Well, after...after my father died,nI made rather a nuisance of myself. I became very, as you put it,nearnest, and practically ran away from home to try to work for mynliving. You might have noticed that I didn't come back to Societynfunctions after my mourning was over...\" She trailed off, becausenonce again she'd said too much. She'd hoped he'd noticed;nsometimes she thought that had been the real reason she'd done it. \"I had,\" he said, his voicentwisting in that wonderful way it always had, when he wanted tonlaugh, but wasn't sure how she'd take it. Instead of annoyingnher, the way it often had nine years ago, her heart lifted when shenheard it. \"Well, before I did, I told everyonenwhat I thought of them. In Aunt Louisa's case, it wasn't verynnice, though it wasn't anything compared to what I said to Mummy. nAnyway, Aunt Louisa proved me wrong. She's really a wonderfulnhostess for the soldiers; she somehow manages to make all of themnfeel welcome, which, heaven knows, isn't always easy to do atnSweetbriars.\" \"I'll have to take your word fornit, since I've never been there,\" Rupert said. \"LordnStockbridge had invited me for the shooting, but...but it didn'tnwork out.\" Of course it didn't, Isobelnthought. Murder tends to interrupt even stolid, upper-class Britishnlives. \"I'd like to see it some day,\"nRupert added, startling her. Did he mean...? \"Well, you'll probably be sentnthere for your convalescence,\" she said, her voice slippingnnaturally into her cheerful-nurse tone. \"Most of our patients are.n And it won't be too long, I'm certain.\" \"That wasn't what I meant,\"nRupert said. The intensity in his soft voice sent shivers up hernspine, just the way it had nine years ago, and, almost against hernwill, Isobel found herself raising her eyes to his. What she saw there made her catch hernbreath. She'd seen it before, nine years ago, but she had been toonyoung and inexperienced to recognize it. Instead, she'd believednwhat she'd overheard his friend say, believed that he was onlynafter her money. When she'd finally got up the courage to talk tonAunt Lavinia about it, her aunt had told her that she'd believed itnbecause she couldn't convince herself that someone would love hernfor herself. Aunt Lavinia had also said a lot of things about how itnwas all the fault of her home life, because her parents hadn'tnprovided her with love and respect, but that had been when her auntnwas going through her Freudian phase. Her father had certainly lovednher, and she had learned early on to live with her mother'sndisapproval. After all, her mother disapproved of almost everybody. nAnd she'd never told Aunt Lavinia about Freddie. At any rate, she certainly recognizednwhat was in Rupert's eyes now, but she couldn't seem to donanything about it. She just sat there, staring at him, holding hisngaze with all the intensity of those long, empty, nine years. Hengazed right back, and she almost thought that he felt the same way. \"Isobel...\" he said, so quietlynthat only the fact that it was her name enabled her to hear it. Henshifted his gaze for a moment, from one side to the other. She wouldnhave followed his action, but she found that she just didn't carenif anyone else saw them like this. Rupert looked down at her hands,nresting in her lap, then reached out one of his own and laced hisnfingers through hers. \"I loved you, you know,\" he saidnto their clasped hands, \"and I still do. It was never about thenmoney, though I can certainly understand why you thought so -\" Isobel reached out with the hand henwasn't holding and touched his lips, making him stop at once. Shenshook her head, feeling her eyes burn with unshed tears. \"I know,\" she said, and thennanything else she might have said flew out of her mind when henstarted kissing her fingertips. She closed her eyes, savoring thenfeeling of something she'd long since given up as impossible. Thisnmust be a dream, she thought. I'll wake up, and it won'tnhave happened... To reassure herself, she opened her eyes andnlooked around the ward. The nerve gas victim in the next bed overnhad awoken, and was watching them with unashamed interest. Henactually gave her a thumbs-up sign, which made her look back quicklynat Rupert. Rupert's eyes were fixed on her, andnthe look in them made her tingle all over.\"Isobel,\" he said,nthen stopped for a moment. He licked his lips, then continued, \"Inknow this isn't the perfect time, but I would like to see younagain.\" \"That's,\" Isobel said, stopped,nswallowed, and went on, \"that's exactly what you said that...thatnnight...\" \"I know,\" Rupert said. \"Inthought maybe we could start over again, from where we left off.\" \"I'd like that,\" Isobel said,nfeeling his grip on her hand like a lifeline. \"I'd like thatnvery much.\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: Gosford Park belongs tonRobert Altman, Bob Balaban, and USA Films.

Prompt: Mary andnRobert, post-war. The setting is Paris, the fluff is to a minimum andnthere is black market coffee. Lots of it. Notes: Couldn'tnfollow everything in the prompt, but I hope my meagre efforts werenacceptable. ***** 1. Thenfirst time Robert had come across the young servant girl was in thenlibrary of his father's country estate. It was supposed to be anweekend for shooting and hunting, and apparently his father hadndecided to hunt for more than birds. Again. Disgustednby the whole sordid mess, Robert was completely ready to quit thenroom when he realised that the girl was in fact struggling. For anshort moment he was, surprisingly, shocked and appalled. Womanisernthat the man was, Sir William McCordle had never been known fornforcing himself on anyone. Hisneyes scanned the room quickly and found their target on the nearlynempty bottle of whiskey. Damn. Nothing else to do now except theninevitable. Robert strode forward and beckoned at the girl, who, morenagile than she looked, slipped under his father's arm and ran tonthe spot right behind Robert. Hisnfather turned sharply around, looking completely ready to strikenRobert. \"What do you think you're doing?\" he asked, his tonenominously calm. \"Stopnscaring the poor thing, Father,\" he answered with a cheer that hendidn't feel. \"Surely you haven't resort to piteous countryngirls like that yet? I'm sure Elsie must be rather lonely at thenmoment.\" Hisnfather stared at him wordlessly and imperiously for so long that anreluctant apology had begun to form in his mind, but finally thenman's face split into a grin. \"Robert, my boy, why couldn't younjust tell your old man that you've set your eye on the girlnyourself?\" he exclaimed, clapping Robert on the shoulder, andnstrode out of the room. Robertnlet go of a breath that he didn't know he was holding and turnedntoward the girl. She wasn't bad-looking, but nothing spectacular.nTrust his father to be so undiscriminating. \"What's your name?\"nhe asked. Thengirl blinked several times and slowly, oh-so-slowly, raised her head.n\"Mary,\" she mumbled with a heavy Scottish baroque. Asntheir eyes met, Robert was somewhat surprised by how bright andnintelligent her eyes were, but even more surprised by the fear theynstill held. He blinked a little, then it finally occurred to him thatnshe had actually taken his father's words at face value. Robertnsnorted. \"You may go, Mary. Take care not to attract my father'snattentions again, hm?\" Thengirl nodded and scampered away. Robert shook his head and strollednback to the drawing room. ***** 2. Thensecond time that Robert had seen the young lady was in thenStockbridges' house in town. Lady Stockbridge was holding one ofnher soirees and of course the Countess of Trentham would bring hernadopted daughter along. Thenyoung lady had had her coming out party a few months ago, Robertnheard, but there weren't any serious suitors yet. With littleninheritance, next to no beauty to speak of, and only an impoverishedncountess for connections, Miss Trentham's prospects looked rathernlimited. Butnnone of that was of any concern to Robert anyway. It was none of hisnbusiness that the re-assuring smile she had given the new andnstumbling housemaid was the kindest expression he had seen in far toonlong. It was definitely none of his business that her eyes werenbright and cheerful, that her mouth was quick to smile, or that hernfigure was slender and rather shapely, no matter how uncontrollablynshe had made his heart thump. And it was most certainly none of hisnbusiness that no matter how kindly she had smiled at the servants,nher sweetest smiles were reserved for Mr. Blond alone. Henshook his head and laughed silently at himself, moping about like anboy of fifteen instead of a man of thirty. He had gone back into hisnroom to read, but obviously that wasn't working. Stretching out thenvarious kinks of his body, Robert walked briskly out of his roomnagain as the noise in the ballroom was slowly dying down. Asnhe passed by the staircase, however, he saw a quick movement in hisnperipheral vision and turned his head. On the landing, just behindnone of the conveniently-placed ficus stood Miss Trentham and Mr.nBlond, who were talking quietly and intimately to each other. Luckilynthey hadn't noticed him yet, and Robert had a mind not to bennoticed. He continued to Lord Stockbridge's room and began tidyingnthings up for his employer's return. Whennhis master arrived at the room with Lady Stockbridge in tow, theynwere talking happily of the upcoming marriage between Miss Trenthamnand Mr. Blond. Listening quietly, Robert went about his business andndidn't even notice that he had clenched his fists until his palmsnhad begun to bleed. Wincing,nhe quickly gathered up the rest of Lord Stockbridge's things andnhalf-stumbled out of the room. ***** 3. Thenthird time that Robert had seen her was in London. Queuingnup at the conscription office, Robert looked around lazily and triednto assess his soon-to-be fellow soldiers. Would they be good soldiersnor bad ones? Would they run on the battlefield or fight till theirnlast breath? Did it matter? After all, they had called the Great Warn\"the war to end all wars\", and everyone knew what happened tonthat. Henglanced at the office next door, the one for the AuxiliarynTerritorial Service, and found himself looking at one MarynMaceachran. No! his heart cried, and he shuddered, feeling as if someone had poured anbucket of ice water on his head. His first thought was that he shouldnrun over, pull her out of the queue, and forbid her from ever doingnsomething this dangerous. His second was acknowledging the futilitynof a gesture like that. Afternall, he was no one to her. They had said no more than ten words toneach other since that fateful day eight years ago, when Robert hadnstopped a despicably drunk Sir William McCordle from forcing himselfnon her. Any advances on Robert's part after that would have beenninconsiderate and callous, and Robert simply hadn't the heart tonpursue Mary any further or to kill the man like he had planned for sonlong. Henswallowed heavily and went back to waiting. The number of women innthat queue was rather small, which was only to be expected, and soonnMary had finished registering. A soft, content smile on her face, shenwalked out of that office with her head held high, looked around forna short while, as if feeling his gaze, and began to march away. Robertnthought of calling her, but the thought of meaningless small talknwith the woman he still loved was painful to him. And he was about tongo away for war, for God's sake. It wasn't like he could give hernanything, even if he could gather the courage to speak his heart. Itnwouldn't be fair to her or to himself. Henwatched her slender form disappearing into the crowd. ***** 4. Thenfourth time Robert had seen the young angel was in a field hospitalnsomewhere in the middle of the Continent. Fornweeks he and his section, bone-tired as they'd already become, hadnfought in a battle that seemed utterly pointless and with no end innsight. Just old enough for conscription at the very end of the GreatnWar, he was the only man in his section who'd seen any action.nEventually they were ambushed, by a bomb that went off in closenenough proximity to knock everyone out, and they were eventually sentnto the back. Whennhe finally woke up, he didn't even know if he'd wanted to opennhis eyes. The smell of blood was so strong in the air that Robert wasnalmost sure he was still somewhere on the battlefield. But no, thenmaterial he was lying on was soft and the smell of disinfectantnfinally penetrated his nostrils. Hospital,nhe noted, and sighed in relief. Then he tensed up again and begannwriggling his extremities. After he'd found everything he still hadnwell and intact, he relaxed again and opened his eyes. Thenfirst face he saw was his superior's, but the second one made hisnheart pound. \"Mary?\" he forced out, torn between desperate hopenand disbelief. Mary was the only girl who'd ever looked at him andnhis hand normally, even after he'd taken off his gloves (hensupposed he should be grateful for an employer who didn't mind anslightly maimed servant — provided he kept his gloves on at allntimes, of course). \"I'mnsorry, but how do you know my nam—,\" she answered, then her eyesnwidened almost comically. \"Oh, my Lord, Robert, is that you? GoodnGod, it is you.\" Her mouth stretching immediately into a smile,nMary held his hand and pulled a stool under her. \"Don't worry,nI'm here.\" \"Mary,\"nhe repeated her name, not knowing what else to say. He squeezed hernhand and, exhausted by the past month, dropped off into a deep andneasy sleep, dreaming longingly of his mother's kind and lovingnsmile on the day he left. ***** 5. Thenfifth time Robert had seen the gir — nay, woman — was on thenstreets of Paris. Theynhad won the war just months ago and Robert had been wandering aroundnParis for all those months, soaking up the atmosphere and thenlanguage both -- learning more than he ever would at a university,nRobert was sure. Henwas sitting at one of the outdoor tables at a café, sipping coffeenand once again puzzling over whether to go \"home\". (He had oncenasked the proprietor of the shop about the origins of the coffeenbeans, wanting to buy some himself, but the man had only raised andneyebrow. Robert had nodded and returned to his seat without delay.nJust because he was foolish enough to ask such a question in thenfirst place did not mean he was stupid enough to ask twice.) Someonenin pumps was walking by, and the click-click-click of those heelsnwere especially loud to his ears this early in the morning. Henglanced up and caught a familiar figure striding past, withnheavy-looking bags in both her hands. At first he couldn't recallnher name, a fact that pained him considerably, and by the time henhad, she was already quite a bit away. He considered calling afternher, but she looked rather busy, with her bags and her purposefulnstride. Anpang of old heartaches and unrequited passions caught and squeezednhis heart for a short moment, but he pushed them to the back of hisnmind finally. They had slept together once, yes, but her time as annurse trainee during the war had given her much better prospects. Henraised his coffee cup after her, silently wishing her all thenhappiness and luck in the world. ~~nfinis ~~ ","Summary":" Date:n18th December 2006 Pairing:nRobert Parks/Mary Maceachran Disclaimer:nEverything belonged to U"},{"Movie":"Gosford Park","Title":"Keep The Home–Fires Burning","Author":"LJC","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7728731","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: Gosford Park and all related elements, characters and indicia © Sandcastle 5 / Chicago Films / USA Films / Capitol Films and the Film Council / Focus Features / Universal 2001.

Keep The Home-Fires Burning by LJC Mary Parks, née MacEachran, believed she could handle anything. Grumpy scheming selfish dowagers, rationing, even the nightly bombings were manageable so long as she kept her wits about her and a cool head. At the moment, however, an angry four year old girl was pushing her patience to the limit. \"But I don't want to go,\" Jane said, digging her heels in. \"I want to stay with Nanny Gresham and Robbie and James.\" Mary pulled Jane over to the side of the train platform as families milled around them, and dropped to her knees. \"Mrs Gresham and her boys have gone away to her family the country because of the bombs. We're going to the country too, and stay with Nanny Wilson. No more smelly Anderson shelter, no more smelly gas mask. Won't that be better?\" Jane shook her head, her dark green eyes filling with tears, and Mary sighed. \"Jane Alice Parks, what would your daddy say, if he saw you being such a bad girl?\" At the mention of her daddy, Jane's lower lip began to quiver, and Mary steeled herself for fresh floods of tears. But Jane lifted her chin and clutched her doll closer to her chest. Mary stood and half-walked and half-dragged her daughter to the train. Only when they were tucked into a hard wooden seat in the Third Class section of the carriage, did Mary begin to breathe again. The pale green rail ticket was clutched in her fingers, and she smoothed Jane's dark hair back from her brow. There was a dozing elderly couple opposite them, and the rest of the four seats were taken up by a large family, the eldest boys refusing to hold still despite their mother's pleading. As the packed train pulled out of the station, Mary allowed her thoughts to wander. The last time she'd been on a train had been when Robert had finished basic training at Aldershot, almost eight months prior. They'd met up for a single night in a hotel, while their landlady, Mrs Gresham, minded Jane for her. Robert had looked so smart in his uniform, and he'd been in good spirits. He'd been offered a position as batman to one of Lord Stockbridge's cronies in his regiment, as trained servants were in high demand among the gentry. But Mary had still been terribly frightened for him. It had been his idea to have little Jane evacuated to his mother in the country. After the shock of learning that his mother—the mother he had set out to avenge—had given him up, the two had become quite close. Closer than Mary had thought possible. Once Robert had learnt to forgive his mother, and by extension, himself, it had almost been like a fairy tale. Mrs Wilson, who had mourned the loss of her son for thirty years, was able to get to know her grown son. As for Robert, he gloried in suddenly acquiring a family. He seemed to shine from within, and all of the darkness that had plagued his childhood and youth was extinguished by the fierce, quiet devotion of Mrs Wilson and even gruff Mrs Croft. Mary supposed it was every orphan's dream: to discover they were in fact loved and wanted, and to be rescued of a life of loneliness. When Mary had given her notice, the Countess had been furious. She'd felt abandoned and had somehow wasted all that time training Mary up as a lady's maid, all her \"charity work\" for naught. She hadn't even given Mary a reference, despite the fact that their relationship had warmed considerably after that horrible house party at Gosford Park. Mary had landed on her feet however. The network of upper servants, to which Mary had been so hastily introduced, proved to be her salvation. She found a place almost immediately at a Bond street shop opened by a well-known former lady's maid. She'd made more in a week, selling hats and gowns, than she had in a month as Lady Trentham's lady's maid. But it was such a different life than she was used to. She was both excited and terrified of the idea of striking out on her own. For good or ill, life in service had been like remaining in the bosom of a family—even if they had not been her own dear family. Mr Burkett the butler was the stern and staid father, Mrs Darrow the housekeeper a mother to all the girls in the house. Mrs Neelan the cook was always a bit harried, but cheerful despite Lady Trentham's constant demands. Merriman the chauffeur was like a crafty old uncle, and the two footmen, Fred and Michael treated Mary like a sister, right down to gentle teasing about her accent and funny Scottish ways. And like a family, not everything was wine and roses. The senior housemaid Sarah was jealous and mean-spirited at the idea of serving morning tea to a lady's maid four years her junior, so Mary had always taken her tea with the housekeeper in the Pug's Parlour. She found out later it was because Sarah had assumed she would become Lady Trentham's lady's maid, rather than a girl from an agency. But the two junior housemaids were nice enough—if cool to her—and in their looks they reminded Mary of her own sisters, whom she missed terribly. She'd hated London and her gloomy attic bedroom at first, but after three years, it had become home. Of course, the close-knit family of Lady Trentham's household made it difficult for Mary to have much of a personal life. Having a \"sweetheart\" had been novel for Mary, and she had to admit, having to keep it a secret made it all the more thrilling. Mrs Darrow had always been quite firm about the servants having no followers, but as a lady's maid Mary wasn't under as tight scrutiny as the housemaids. While Lord Stockbridge was in the City, Robert and Mary were able to share rare evenings twice a month when they could arrange it. They wrote letters constantly, and on the rare occasions the Carton sisters' families gathered together for shooting parties and holidays, weddings and funerals, they were able to meet under more relaxed circumstances. Visiting servants were allowed that bit more freedom. Having escaped the watchful eyes of their respective households, there had been many a stolen kiss or quiet conversation over cups of tea. The valet and the lady's maid was hardly a scandal—in some houses where the butler and housekeeper were married, it was in fact a common tale. Robert had made it clear from the start that he wished to marry her, and Mary wanted nothing else. But her own family had come first. Most of her wages were sent back to her mother in Glasgow, who was bringing up Mary's young brothers who were born shortly before her father's death. As the eldest, it had fallen on Mary to go into service after her father had died, and help support the family. She had only been able to leave the Countess' employ when her two younger sisters had gone into service themselves—one as a dormitory maid in a school in Glasgow, and the other was a maid of all work with a family in Newcastle. Secure in the knowledge that her mother and siblings were taken care of, Mary MacEachran could finally begin living her own life for herself at last. Her mother had been shocked when Mary had written to tell her that she was engaged to be married to another servant. It was only after Mary and Robert had taken the train up to Glasgow that Mrs MacEachran had relented. Robert had put by enough that they could rent a bedsit in a respectable part of town, and Robert had taken a job at a fashionable London hotel. It was something her mother could boast of, then, having a son-in-law at the Savoy, which sounded like a palace from the way Robert described it—particularly after the King dined there. Once Mrs MacEachran had given her blessing to the proposed union, Robert and Mary had finally married in the spring of 1934. It had been very quiet—just the two of them in a London registry office, with two of their single friends from work as witnesses. They'd had a photograph taken, and Mary had posted a copy to her mother. Robert had done the same, addressing it care of the hotel in Margate Mr Probert had purchased with his legacy from Sir William, where Mrs Wilson and Mrs Croft had taken places. No-one had been more surprised than Lady Sylvia when Mrs Wilson and Mrs Croft left the Gosford estate for Margate. Robert had read his mother's letter aloud to Mary as they sat side by side in Hyde Park, smiling broadly and with no small amount of schadenfreude . Mary had teased him, but she had been glad that the Park sisters had finally got out from under the shadow of their pasts and were moving forward as friends once more. As little Jane was rocked into a fitful dozing slumber by the motion of the train, Mary smiled down at her daughter's dark head. She was Robert in miniature, with her bobbed black hair and merry green eyes. The only reflection Mary could see in the child was the shape of her face, and her full mouth. The first two years of their married had been blissful. The hours they worked had seemed like heaven after a lifetime in service. No more were they expected to toil twenty hours a day, seven days a week for their \"betters\" with no lives of their own outside of a free afternoon twice a month. There was time to go to the cinema, stroll in the park; read in the evenings before the gas fire, and Sundays afternoons to take the train to the seaside. Free to be people, instead of pieces of furniture. Highly polished and appreciated furniture; but furniture, nonetheless. Not only that, but she no longer had to wear the same black crepe dress every day, with its little black apron like a housemaid. She wore skirts and cardigans during the day, but hanging in her closet were colours and prints she could never have worn while in service. Robert's favourite was a smart blue dress with white lace collar, but Mary's favourite was a dark green dress with pleats. Her Sunday best was just as stylish as the other young ladies she saw in the streets, rayon crepe with a skirt below her knee and trimmed with handmade lace. Her dark green felt hat cost her three guineas, which had seemed untold fortune to her when she was a slip of a girl newly down to London from Glasgow. Lady Trentham's heart would have stopped to have seen her in Hyde Park in her tweeds. Mary had never thought she could be so happy. When she became pregnant, she'd worried that Robert would be angry because she'd have to leave working in the shop. But instead of being cross at the rapid change and the loss in income, he had been overjoyed , sharing round with all their neighbours that he was to become a father. At night, as they lay beneath the coverlet, he would place a large hand on her abdomen, fancying that he could feel the baby. As she'd grown larger, her ankles swelling and toddling ungainly up and down the stairs, they'd moved into a new flat in Marylebone on Talbot Road near the Kensington boundary. The birth had been hard, and Mary had wished her mam could have been there. But the district nurse was sent for to midwife, and little Jane was born healthy and strong in the spring of 1936. They had named her for Robert's mother, with her middle name for Mary's gran. Robert gave her a short string of pearls for their anniversary—the most extravagant gift she had ever received, even if she knew they had come from an East End pawn shop, and had cost no more than £5. Her hand drifted up to stroke the pearls around her neck, as the English countryside flashed by outside the train carriage windows. Robert would have spoilt Jane rotten, if Mary hadn't kept a firm hand. He showered all the love and affection on his own daughter that he'd been denied as a child, and Jane had him wrapped around her tiny finger from the moment she was born. Even the sleepless nights, pinching pennies, and on the whole losing so much of their hard-won freedom—their daughter's smiles and laughter made it all feel worth it. Then, of course, there was the war. Robert hadn't waited to be called up, but enlisted in the army within a week of war being declared. Mary was proud of him for that, but terribly selfish as well. She would have had him with her and baby Jane right up until the very last second. With all of London half-mad with fear of the Germans invading, it heartened her knowing that her husband was fighting for not just his family's freedom, but all of civilised Europe. That didn't change the hollow feeling as she'd pulled back the coverlet on their bed each night, missing his warmth and bulk. How safe she always felt his arms around her. She slept with Jane curled in her arms now, and she hoped their daughter would remember her father when he finally returned home from the front. Mrs Wilson was in the garden of the cottage when Mary and Jane arrived. The train ride had been long for both mother and child, followed by the bus journey from Leominster rail station to the village. But Mary had kept Jane entertained by pointing out all the animals in the fields outside the bus' windows. There had been cattle and sheep, horses and goats. It had been like an outing to the Zoo for the little girl, who waved excitedly from the dingy windows at every four-legged creature they passed. The final walk to the cottage on Green Lane was blessedly short, and they arrived in early evening, just as the sky was beginning to darken in the East to a rich royal blue. Mrs Wilson wore a smock apron over a print dress, and enormous straw sun hat. Her hands were protected by gloves, which she tugged off as she came down to the gate to meet them. Mary hardly recognised her, she was so changed from the last time she had seen her at Gosford. Gone was the severe grey dress and lace collar, waved bobbed hair, pale cheeks and thin-lipped smile. In their place was a cheerful older woman with bright eyes and a warm smile, her grey hair pulled back in a sensible bun with wisps that drifted down to soften the sharp lines of her cheekbones. \"Lizzy!\" she called back over her shoulder. \"Lizzy, they're here!\" Mary barely got the gate open before she was swept up into a hug. She had never actually been hugged by the former housekeeper before, and colour flooded her cheeks while Jane fussed, unused to strangers. The little girl sucked on her fingers, and Mary pried them from her mouth. \"Jane, this is your grandmother. Remember the picture daddy has on the mantel? Say hello to Granny Jane.\" \"You can't be Jane. I'm Jane,\" she said, her little face screwing up with concern. Mary flushed again. \"Hush now, don't be rude.\" Mrs Wilson only laughed, and took the girl's hand in her own, giving it a friendly firm handshake. \"That's right. You are Jane. You can just call me 'Nan'. Would that be alright, Miss?\" Jane buried her face in Mary's shoulder. \"She's only tired,\" Mary offered by way of apology as she set the child on her feet. \"Of course. Goodness, you must both be. Come inside. We've a fire going, and Eliza has just put the kettle on.\" Mrs Croft opened the cottage door, and Mary was once again struck by how different the older woman appeared, compared to the autocratic cook of Gosford she had met so long ago. Mrs Croft's blue eyes twinkled, and were the same blue as her wool dress as she took in the sight of little Jane. \"Poor little mite. Arms like twigs! We'll have to fatten her up. Clean country air and good food, that's what she needs.\" Jane shrieked, and dove behind Mary, hiding her face in her mother's long wool coat. \"I don't want to go in the oven!\" \"It's my fault—her favourite story is Hansel and Gretel .\" Mary struggled to pull the cringing child out from behidn her. \"Jane, this is your Aunt Elizabeth. She's not going to eat you, you silly, silly girl! Come and say hello like a good girl.\" Jane continued to bury her face in Mary's coat, but Mrs Croft took it all in stride, as if crying four year olds were no better or worse than new scullery maids. Mary's case was put next to the stairs, and she hung her hat and wool coat with its grey fur collar on a peg next to the door. The cottage had whitewashed walls and wood floors covered in lovely braided rag rugs, with a slightly worn sofa dominating the sitting room. A fire blazed merrily in the hearth, and Mary noted it was wood rather than coal, though a copper helmet coal scuttle sat empty on the hearthstones. Mrs Croft brought out a tray with teapot and china, and slices of brown bread spread thickly with butter. At the sight of food, Jane began excitedly tugging at Mary's sleeve. Mary pulled the girl up onto her lap, and tucked a napkin under her chin to catch the crumbs before she gave her a slice of bread. Mary was given a cup of tea, into which she stirred a lump of greyish beet sugar, and a dollop of fresh milk. It took ages for the sugar to dissolve, but once it had, she poured a little of the tea into the saucer for Jane to sip. Mary's eyes were drawn to the photos in their cardboard frames atop the mantel, bracketed on either side by china figurines. Mrs Croft's poor dead son, in a beautiful lace-trimmed Christening gown. A photo of Robert in uniform. Robert and Mary on their wedding day. Last was a photo of Jane as a baby, in her Christening gown which Mary's mother had made. For all she'd never set foot in the Parks sister's cottage before, it felt like coming home. So different from their flat in London. So alien, compared to her mother's home in Glasgow. But warm and cosy, and welcoming. \"We weren't expecting you til tomorrow,\" Mrs Wilson said as she stirred her own tea. \"I hope it's no bother—\" Mary began, but Mrs Croft, lighting a cigarette, waved her concern away. \"We're so happy to have you, child. The two of us knocking about on our own—it will be good to have you and the little one here.\" \"You've such a lovely home.\" \"We landed on our feet, that's for certain. The cottage was going empty, and so we pay a peppercorn rent of £1 per year, in exchange for keeping the place up.\" \"Have you heard from Robert?\" Mrs Wilson asked, her anxiety making her mask of contentment cracking just a little. \"I've a letter from him,\" Mary said, fishing in her bag for the much-folded paper tucked safely in its envelope. She handed it to Mrs Wilson, who treated it reverently. \"He's in France, and the letter was censored. But he said the Regiment isn't expected to stay there much longer.\" \"But he's well?\" \"As well as can be expected,\" Mary said lamely, smoothing Jane's hair back from her brow as the girl rested her head on her mother's knee, fingers back in her mouth. \"He misses us—I write to him every week, but sometimes the letters don't get to him right away and they catch him up all at once. I was very worried about him over the winter, but he's the Major's batman, so that's a little bit more comfort than most of the men get, I expect.\" \"Yes, of course. I remember...\" Mrs Wilson trailed off. \"You're too young to remember the Great War. But I thanks God every day that he was too young. We lost so many young men.\" \"They keep saying the war will be over by Christmas.\" \"They always say that,\" Mrs Croft said, slightly bitterly, as she tapped the ash from her cigarette into a tin ashtray on the corner of the table. \"But whether it is or isn't, what matters is that you're here, now.\" \"I'm so glad you're out of London, Mary, dear,\" Mrs Wilson said, leaning forward across the table to clasp Mary's hand. \"We've been so terribly worried, haven't we, Lizzy?\" \"I'm going to get supper started,\" Mrs Croft said, stubbing out her half-smoked cigarette. \"And then tomorrow, we can get you registered down ion the village. We've milk and eggs, and plenty of potatoes, turnips, and the like from the garden. You and the child will do well here, much better than in the Smoke. You'll see.\" After a filling dinner—much better than Mary'd had in a while—she got Jane settled into the narrow bed in the second bedroom and unpacked their cases. She hung her things in the wardrobe, and placed her framed picture of Robert in his uniform by the bed so it would be the first thing she saw when she woke. The blackouts were already up, and there was an extra quilt handing over the arm of the chair in the corner which she tucked around the sleeping girl. She joined Mrs Wilson by the fire, each with their knitting and darning. Except Mary was no longer mending one of Lady Trentham's frocks, and Mrs Wilson was knitting socks—something Mary would never have been able to picture before. \"How are you family, then?\" \"My sisters are working now, and my mam and the boys are still in the city. Jamie's been doing very well in school, but Fraser is still a terror. My mam's already arranged a place for him as a hall boy to start after the term ends. She thinks he just needs some discipline and responsibility. I wonder, sometimes, if it's worth it. \" \"That's the luxury of choice,\" Mrs Wilson said with a rueful smile. \"Well, perhaps things have changed since I was a girl. But the old ways are just that—the old ways. Gosford has been turned into a convalescence hospital for officers, did you know?\" \"No! I only knew Lady Sylvia had sold it, after Miss Isobel married.\" \"Mr Probert keeps us filled in with all the gossip, bless him.\" \"I can never picture Gosford without Mr Jennings,\" Mary said with a sigh. \"I've asked after him, but no-one seems to know what happened to him. Although Dorothy the stillroom maid married one of the groundskeepers, and is still there. She took training as a nurse.\" \"Oh well done, Dorothy! I think of her every time I spread marmalade on my toast for tea. Isn't that mad?\" \"Not mad at all. Her marmalade was a treat.\" \"What are you two gossiping about, then?\" Mrs Croft asked as she came in from the kitchen with a steaming cup of tea. \"Reminiscing, and catching up on whatever happened to everyone.\" \"The past is the past, that's what I say. No use reliving it all the time.\" \"Now, Lizzy. No need to be so dour.\" Mrs Croft stirred her tea, and gave her sister a dark look. Mary assumed this was an old argument between them, and tried her best to hide her smile. \"I had a letter just last week from Bertha. She and Lottie are at one of them big hotels, now. All my girls are doing fine. Most of them scullery maids carried on as if nothing had happened, and got places right off. People fight for girls I've trained up, you know.\" \"Mine as well,\" Mrs Wilson said, lifting her chin a fraction. \"I saw Janet Williams two months ago, in Hyde Park.\" Mary put down the jumper she was knitting, her knitting needles clicking as they fell in her lap. \"She's head housemaid at Lord Trentham's house in London, and she said May took a secretarial course and works for Lyons teashops.\" \"Well wonders never cease! May was always a good girl. Clever, too.\" \"I always wonder what happened to Lewis, lady Sylvia's maid.\" \"She'll be with Lady Sylvia until the end, you mark my words,\" Mrs Croft said with a chuckle. \"Thirty years, she's been with that horrible woman.\" \"No-one else would put up with her,\" Mrs Wilson added, and Mary had to stifle a chuckle. \"I used to hear from Elsie now and then, after she went off to America. She wrote films—can you believe it?\" Mrs Wilson pursed her lips. \"She's no better than she ought to be, that one.\" \"Now, Jane. Don't judge the girl for making the same mistakes we did,\" Mrs Croft said charitably. \"Which films? I like a trip to the cinema, now and again, me.\" \"Well, she said they had her write some bits for a film set at a house party. And then she wrote two that they never made, for John Barrymore and Myrna Loy. Only they paid her anyway. Can you imagine? And she wrote a picture last year for someone named Vincent Price, only I've never heard of him.\" Mrs Croft sniffed. \"I always liked films about the cowboys and red Indians, myself. I sued to go to the pictures when I was at the factory, to see one reelers. We all did, back then. It was an escape from... well, from everything, I suppose. All those mountains and plains.\" She sighed. \"Can you imagine, all that space ?\" Mrs Wilson smiled as she picked up another sock to darn. \"I never liked the pictures. But I do miss the theatre.\" \"Robert loves the pictures, but we haven't been since before Jane was born,\" Mary said, trying to remember when she'd last gone to the cinema. \"We saw Garbo in Anna Karenina , I do remember that. I remember Lady Lavinia's maid saying one Christmas that Garbo used to stay with Ivor Novello. Can you imagine? She's so glamorous.\" \"That Sarah was always telling tales,\" Mrs Wilson cautioned her. \"It didn't matter that Commander Meredith didn't have a cent—she was just as bad as anyone, parroting anything Lady Lavinia said like it was gospel.\" \"But I think it must have been true. I read in the papers that he has parties at his flat with all sorts of film stars.\" The room grew quiet, as the memories seemed to thicken the air and catch Mary's breath in her throat. She knew, of course, that Mrs Wilson had killed Sir William. But they never spoke of it. She supposed there was no point to it. After the lack of an inquest, and then Miss Isobel's marriage, it was all swept under the rug. Lady Trentham used to refer to it as \"the regrettable incident\" but that was all. It was like a story she'd been told as a child—hazy and indistinct. It didn't feel real. \"Well, I'm off to bed. We get up with the sun, here in the country,\" Mrs Wilson said, and Mary recognised it was a dismissal as Mrs Wilson put her darning back in its basket and smoothed the skirt of her dress. \"Don't mind Jane, dear,\" Mrs Croft said once Mrs Wilson's footsteps had disappeared up the stairs. \"She doesn't like talking about the past.\" Mary tried to sleep, but the sounds outside the window kept her up. Foxes screamed in the night, startling her despite little Jane's even breathing next to her in the narrow bed. Creeping back down the stairs in her slippers and dressing gown, Mary found Mrs Croft outside the kitchen door, the glowing ember of her cigarette flaring in the dark. \"Oh my—I've never seen so many stars,\" Mary gasped. \"Almost bright enough to read by,\" Mrs Croft said ruefully as she leaned against the doorjamb. Mary pulled a cigarette from the pack in the pocket of her dressing gown, and lit it with the proffered match. She almost never smoked, not even with the girls in the shop who smoked like chimneys. But ever since Robert had gone, she'd had a few each day. Otherwise she hoarded her ration so she could send them to her husband, along with letters and postcards. Always cheerful, always telling him how much they loved him. She'd stopped writing to tell him how much she missed him after the first month, worried that he might think she was being silly. But she knew, from his carefully worded letters, how much he missed them as well. They smoked in companionable silence for a few minutes, and then Mrs Croft turned to Mary, her voice pitched low. \"We've been though worse than this, my dear. And what matters now is that we've got each other. You mark my words.\" Mary nodded, feeling her eyes smarting until she blinked rapidly to clear them. \"Look how far we've come, eh, Miss Trentham?\" Mrs Croft said, winking, and Mary couldn't help but laugh, then. Tomorrow would bring what tomorrow would bring, Mary thought as she looked up at the night sky. She laid an arm across Mrs Croft's shoulders, and they went inside, to listen to the wireless and read by the dying fire.

His lips had struck hers and the shock had traveled up and down her spine to rest pleasantly between her thighs and unpleasantly in her brain. He's a murderer. That's what the electrical impulse said. When he pulled away, the taste of tobacco and mint remained on her palate. His dark eyes looked like the rain could burst forth at any minute. A queer thing, really. What he remembered most about that night was not plunging that carving knife into his father's fat belly. It was not the silver blade, like an extension of his arm, piercing knighted skin to spill the blood they shared. But there was no blood. And he hadn't realised. He hadn't cared. Until he'd kissed her. Hadn't been that night, actually. The next morning. Robert had enjoyed a mere one night of pure rest, sleeping deeply on the rocky servant's mattress, not noticing the springs attacking his spine. No dreams that night. When he awoke, a smile kept playing at his lips. The bastard was dead. Lady Trentham's maid, in her black apron and innocent black eyes, hurrying about with cut cucumbers for her mistresses pruned old bags, seemed to him like the promised rainbow after the storm. He couldn't say why. She had a run in her stocking. No arse to speak of. No breasts, either. But in what should have been the most memorable day of his life, the day he had planned since switching from a vague hope for a fatherly-shape screaming \"well-done\" when he scored in football to wanting to blow the top of that shadow's head off, it was not the blood that struck at his mind. What he remembered most was that kiss. Two years passed, and although she had not forgotten the events of Gosford Park, she had relegated the memories to the back bedroom of her mind, just as her ladyship did literally on her more moody days. Mary took her week holiday home to Dundee to visit her mother. The very next morning, the elder Maceachran had fixed toast and tea for them both and led her only daughter to the dilapidated porch in order to pounce on her personal life. 'You haven't met anyone a'tall?' 'When would I, Mam? You know her ladyship occupies my whole day.' 'Sure as you wouldn't be the first servant to catch some handsome lord's eye.\" 'Mam! Really.' Her mother tightened her shawl a bit more about the shoulder, though the weather was fair. 'I only wish to see you're taken care of, love.' She became interested in taking some jam on her toast so she wouldn't have to answer. Her mind could easily picture Robert Parks in Savile Row tweeds instead of valeting togs, smoking expensive Turkish gold instead of cheap East End dirt. He would still have the uneasy grin. But what she couldn't see was herself beside him. Not in what should have been his proper place nor in what reality dictated. An invitation arrived on Mr. Burkett's silver tray. Lady Trentham a little moan of annoyance and tossed it aside in favour of the little plate of chocolate biscuits Mary offered her. 'Dear, oh dear, what can Sylvia be thinking of?' Over her shoulder, the young maid read\" You are cordially invited to the wedding of Miss Isobel Elizabeth Francine McCordle and Lord Rupert Randolph Adrian Standish- Her ladyship waved the sweet in front of the little gilded paper and she could not finish the rest. She swallowed heavily. 'How—um, how thrilled Lady Sylvia must be.' She knew it was a foolish statement to make but felt compelled to say something. 'Hm! It's a title that girl's after. Why, what else could it be? Those Standishes are nearly penniless.' She \"hmmed\" and \"hmphed\" some more while Mary cleared away the tea service. Her hand twitched a little and she had to settle the tray before she could move. 'Well, I must say, were William alive he would never have stood for this! Whatever else he may have been…' The milk pitcher rattled, spilling her reflection on the perfectly polished tray. 'Will you be attending, milady?' 'Oh, of course I shall attend! No doubt this will be the entertainment event of the season.' That evening, Mary could only pick at her Cullen Skink supper, normally a favourite as it reminded her of home. While her ladyship bathed, she looked at the poor state of the garments in her bureau. Then she felt a blighter for thinking something like that should matter to a maid such as she was. She turned down her ladyship's bed that evening, watching out of the corner of her eye her employer, who sat stone-faced and cucumber-eyed, warming under her fox stoll. She looked less fierce covered as she was, like an adorned sack of potatoes. 'Do you think, milady?' 'Hm? What is it?' 'Will Lord and Lady Stockbridge be at Miss Isobel's wedding, ma'am?' 'Louisa and Raymond? I should think so. Why do you ask?' 'Erm…no reason, milady. Just curiosity.' The countess pealed the vegetable from her face and yawned loudly. 'I suppose I must entertain Lord Philby and his shrewish little wife at supper tomorrow. The man is such a bore, going on and on about his seat in Parliament. Perhaps I should cancel—oh, Mary, will you tell cook I want poached eggs for breakfast tomorrow? And not too runny.' Mary patted the thick down pillows. 'Certainly, milady.' She was glad the question was forgotten. As usual, the weather was dreadful when they arrived at Gosford Park. ' Bloody Rain,' thought Robert, as he slung the sodden luggage onto the lift. ' If there's a God, he likes to have a piss down on fuckin' Billy McCordle's old digs.' He scowled then, at wasting another thought on the man. Everyone, upstairs and down, was distracted by both the downpour and Miss Isobel's allegedly hideous peach-chiffon wedding gown, so that Robert was easily able to slip away into the room he was sharing with some valet called Deeks. Mrs. Wilson had jumped when he'd approached her to find where he'd be at. She'd nearly dropped her clipboard. He alone had some bizarre influence on the old battleaxe he neither comprehended nor particularly wished to. He took to brushing his lordship's dinner jacket. He was not thinking of her. Her, probably straightening the old lady's garments or laying out her jewels. She was only one wing away. One wing and an entire world. In order to avoid the eager, pie-faced fellow who was washing in all over the place, smiling and chatting like a fool, he took his lordship's boots and shoes down to the ironing room to polish. This was just one of his normal tasks. Had nothing to do with looking for her. No one paid him any mind when he barged in. One of the footman, the queer one, wasn't it Arthur or something?...said hello, Stockbridge, to which he gave an indifferent grunt. The whole of the downstairs was prattling on about the cattle upstairs. No one gave a fiddler's fart about their own lives (if they could be called such) so long as the blue-bloods were about. 'Why'd she decide to keep this whole lot anyway? That's what I want to know.' 'Hear she's involved '- 'What! After only a year!' 'Been closer to two, really.' 'An American, too. Made a fortune in copper—or was it silver? Can't recollect.' 'Oy! They never did find who'd done him in, did they?' That was some visiting footman. 'What American? I can't believe her ladyship'- 'I thought that valet done it.' Robert stopped rubbing. He clenched at the rag. 'What valet?' 'Oh, his valet, I expect. Colbert or some such name. He left days after it happened.' 'No, Probert. And a'course he left right! What's he gonna do? His master's dead!' 'Well, yah.' He went back to polishing his reflection into the fine British leather. They ignored him and he they. The best way, that. Robert didn't hear her come in. But he felt as though his heart had been penetrated when the familiar Scottish brogue spoke his name. He spun around, scared her, and she dropped the threaded needle she held in one hand. A lilac-coloured frock, nouveau-cheap, was in the other. 'Sorry,' he said. 'How have you been?' 'Horrid.' She flinched as if unsure whether he was serious or not. 'Then I'm sorry.' 'Don't be. You know I'd not change anything.' 'Robert'- Then nothing. A slight blushing. He stared, although not at anything in particular. Mr. Jennings had appeared ('we have no time for idle gossiping—I hardly think a footman has any business conversing about her ladyship's private affairs') and Robert and Mary watched him chase those under him to go and prepare the tables for dinner. The maids left, still whispering like schoolgirls into each others ears. Now only Dorothy, the head maid, was left. She looked nervously at Jennings' retreating form as if she were a skittish colt left alone in a thunderstorm. Robert sighed heavily. 'Damn.' 'What?' Mary moved a step closer. 'They haven't changed. I'd hoped they had.' She blinked. 'My feelings for you.' His mouth contorted into a painful sort of grin. Picking up his master's shoes, careful of fingermarks, and left her there.

The Servants' Ball by TaranO'Shea Mary MacEachran had never been to a proper Servants' Ball before. Her mother had told her about them, from back in her days of beingna nursery maid at one of the great houses. She'd told Mary stories ofnlife \"behind the Green Baize Doors\" the whole time she wasngrowing up, and when her father died, it had seemed quite sensible tonMary to go into service. After all, she was the eldest, and her mamninsisted it was a safe, decent, honest living for a young girl from angood family. The house where Mrs MacEachran—then Miss Fraser—had worked hadna large ballroom on the first floor, with murals painted all roundnthe sides. During the season, there would be balls every week, andnthe rest of the year it would be shut up while the family was inntown. When they went to Edinburgh, they only took some of thenservants with them. The rest either took temporary positionsnelsewhere, or they worked on half-wages called \"board wages\". Mam said her master and mistress threw a ball just for thenservants on Boxing Day. It had sounded so lavish, so extravagant.nEach of the upper staff—the butler, the housekeeper, the cook, thenhead housemaid, and head footman—was allowed to bring two guests,nand each of the lower staff, just one. In addition to the housenstaff, all of the grounds staff would come as well, from the groomsnto the gardeners to the gamekeepers. Women wore gowns they had madenover from the ladies of the house's cast-offs, or had boughtnsecond-hand. It was no shock to see the upper menservants in finery,nsince most of them wore livery every day and white-tie and tails whennthey served dinner. But it had been amazing to see kitchen maids donenup in colourful gowns, their hair free from caps, dancing the nightnaway. There were matches made, her Mam had told her. And many a babenborn that August who most likely was the result of dancing andnlarking and drinking and living \"as the other half lived\"nfor one night. Lady Trentham didn't hold with them—needless extravagance shencalled it, though the servants' hall gossip was that she was justnpinching a penny as far as it would go, despite the fact that LadynMcCordle had increased her allowance to twice what it was yearly,nbefore Sir William's death. Mary had told no-one about her pay rise,nexcept she was now able to send her Mam an extra five and six a week. Mary had never hoped to see a servants' ball, until Lady Trenthamnhad announced they would be spending Christmas at Gosford Park. The house was to be full to bursting with family, as Lord Cartonnwould be there, and each of Sylvia's sisters and their children. Sonon top of the usual house staff, there would be chauffeurs, valets,nlady's maids, nursery maids and even the Meredith's governess as theynwere bringing their two small sons with them. Gosford, Mr Merriman had told her as they drove up from London,nalways had quite a 'do'. It had been part of what he called SirnWilliam's noblesse oblige , which Merriman pronounced \"nob-lissnob-ligate\". Playing Lord of the Manor and all that. Not onlynwould the house servants be there, but all the tenants and theirnfamilies, as well as visiting servants. The large ballroom on thensecond floor would have food and dancing until eleven o'clock, thenparty having to end early since all the staff would have to be upnearly next day to attend to their normal duties. All the arrangementsnhad been made months before, and Lady Sylvia hadn't cancelled them,ndespite her insisting that \"any day now\" she'd be sellingnthe house and taking up permanent residence in London. Mary had been petrified when she realised that as a lady's maid,neveryone would expect her to be dressed to the nines, and perfectlyncoifed. But her hair was straight as a pin and refused to hold anwave, and she couldn't imagine what she would do for a frock as shenhad little time in the evenings to make over a dress to fit her. Notnwhen she had piles of Lady Trentham's mending to do. Providence provided in the end. When she arrived and the stern MrsnWilson had asked if Mary had evening dress for the ball, and she'dnreplied all she had was her Sunday best—a plain blue muslin thatnhad seen better days. She had been shown to Elsie's old room by May,nwho was now Head Housemaid. Renee and Sarah were sharing a roomnacross the hall, with Miss Ealing, the Meredith's nursery maid,nstaying in the children's suite. Mrs Wilson had appeared in her room that evening with one of MissnIsobel's gowns which had been had cast off after the hem had beenntorn on a nail. Elsie, had she been there, would have either mendednit, or been given it as she'd acted as Miss Isobel's maid since herncoming out. But since Elsie had gone, it had hung in the ironingnroom, forgot. Mrs Wilson supposed that Mary and Miss Isobel were of ansize, it might suit her fine. \"I don't know what to say,\" Mary had said as she'd takennthe gown and folded it reverently over her arm. \"There's nothing to say. You're here as a Countess' lady'snmaid. You should look the part.\" Rather than a glowingncompliment, it came across instead as simply an observation on hownthe proper picture should be presented. Order imposed on a world ofnchaos. In Mrs Wilson's case, through sheer force of will. \"They'llnbe finished with their tea soon. Lady Trentham has been put in thenChinese Room. If there is anything else you need, please let me ornone of the housemaids know.\" \"I will. And Mrs Wilson?\" \"Yes, Miss Trentham?\" \"Will...\" she'd trailed off, unsure of how to phrase thenquestion. Mrs Wilson's steady gaze had unnerved her, and drawn bloodnto her cheeks, and she'd swallowed nervously. \"Will LordnStockbridge be celebrating the holiday with his sister's family?\"nshe had finally asked, trying her best to keep a quaver from hernvoice. Mrs Wilson's eyes had widened, but that was the only sign that thenquestion had affected her. \"Lady Stockbridge is already in thenred drawing room. Lord Stockbridge has been detained in the city. Indoubt we will see him at all this year.\" \"I see.\" \"Will that be all, Miss Trentham?\" \"Yes, thank you.\" Taking the gown from its padded hanger, Mary had been amazed thendress had survived, with a house full of girls who must have covetednsuch finery. It was a plain sea-foam green satin with skirt cut on the bias tonbe full from her knee to the floor. She spent the evening in her roomnrather than the servant's hall, mending the tear, taking up the hemnand sewing a penny's worth of lace inside the low draped neck, as shenwas rather less endowed than Miss Isobel. Not only would the lacensatisfy her modesty, but it would help keep the thin straps fromnslipping down her shoulders. She fretted about the back, which wasncut too low to wear a proper brassiere, as it would show. But she thought if she kept by the punchbowl and didn't dance, shenmight be alright. It had only been a month since the murder. Mary had expected LadynSylvia to still be in mourning black, yet when she had come up tonLady Trentham's room before dinner, she wore a velvet dress of deepncrimson, her nails varnished to match. The family would have dinner at the normal time, waited on bynJennings, the footmen, and May and Ellen. The valets and lady's maidsnwould still be expected to attend to their masters, but Lady Trenthamnhad surprised Mary by telling her to have a splendid time and not tonstay out too late. There had been a twinkle in her mistress' eye asnMary had left her after dressing her for dinner to run upstairs andnchange into her borrowed finery. Mary shyly asked May to help her, and the younger girl had saidnnothing about Mary wearing one of Miss Isobel's dresses, but hadnhelped her fasten up the dress at the back, and pin her hair to onenside with a jewelled comb from Woolworth's. The jewels were paste,nbut it had been a Christmas gift from her mother. Her eyes had fillednwith tears when she had opened the parcel. This was her firstnChristmas away from home, and it was difficult being parted from hernmother and younger siblings. Mary's Christmas gift from Lady Trentham had been a length ofnfabric to make into a new dress, and a pair of kidskin gloves. Thengifts had been presented that morning in the drawing room, where thenhouse servants and visiting servants had assembled in one long queuenin front of the tree which had been decorated with blown glass ballsnand silver tinsel. Mary knew about her gift before she'd unwrappednit, as she'd been the one to pack her Ladyship's things for thenvisit. But she curtseyed nicely and gave a proper thank you, knowingnit was more than most would receive this year. Only Mrs Meredith'snmaid, Sarah, had got a pair of gloves as well. But they weren't asnfine as Mary's, because Commander Meredith was still skint, Barnesntold them when they had their tea, and Sarah had blushed scarlet andnrefused to talk to him for the rest of the afternoon. \"You don't think I look too...\" She trailed off, hernhands fluttering helplessly. Though she was covered from head to footnit left her shoulders bare, and she had no wrap. She kept resistingnthe urge to cross her arms in front of her. \"A little lippy, and you'll look like a film star,\" Maynsaid with a giggle. Mary had coloured, thinking of how she'd madensuch a fool of herself over Ivor Novello. Elsie had written to hernfrom California, and in no uncertain terms made it perfectly clearnthat had Mary managed to find herself in the matinee idol's company,nher virtue would have been perfectly safe as he \"prefers andifferent sort entirely. Of the musical variety\". May looked lovely, her blond hair cropped in a chin-length bob,nand she wore a lilac gown that her sister had got from her mistress,na vicar's wife. Both of them wore black shoes, as they had none tonmatch, but at least Mary's skirt was long enough that no-one couldnsee them and her plain black stockings beneath. They walked down tonthe second floor together, and Mary held her breath as she steppednthrough the green baize doors to the main corridor. She could hearnmusic coming from the ballroom already. There was a buffet set up in the centre of the floor loaded highnwith cold chicken and beef, and musicians from the village alternatednbetween lively country dances and staid waltzes. Among the men innblack and white tails there were plenty of outdoor staff in theirnSunday best as well as checked trousers and red neckcloths. Theyntended to sit out the waltzes, but take to the floor with great gustonfor the reels and polkas. Mrs Wilson and Mr Jennings led the dancing, and then once thenparty was in full swing, Mary saw Wilson retire to a chair near thendoor with a glass of punch. Mrs Croft, nearly unrecognisable in andark blue silk frock, soon joined her. Wilson scowled at Mrs Croft'sncigarette, but Mary was surprised and shocked to see them speakingnnot just civilly to one another, but even warmly as they kept watchnover their respective staffs. Mary thought Miss Lewis looked a bit lonely, as Mr Probert hadngone off to his sister's. She wore a dark blue dress with a squarenneck trimmed with lace that seemed like something from a forgottennage, like the photos Mary had seen of her mother when she was young.nLewis had been with Lady Sylvia since her coming out, Renee had saidnin the ironing room that morning. Her whole life spent in service,nand never a whisper of her having a follower, though there had beennrumours once about her and the butler at Sir William's house in town,nwho was considerably younger and more dashing than Mr Jennings. The second footman, Arthur, stayed by Mary most of the evening,nclearly uncomfortable asking any of the ladies to dance. Dorothy thenstillroom maid was on the opposite side of the ballroom dancing withnMerriman, but Mary could see her eyes following Mr Jennings as henprimly waltzed with Mrs Wilson. George danced with Bertha the kitchennmaid, the seams of her dress straining slightly as he twirled hernacross he floor while the other kitchen maids and tweenies scowlednwith envy. As she drank her third cup of punch, Mary felt a light touch atnher elbow. She turned, a ready refusal on her lips when she froze. Robert Parks was dressed in his dark suit and striped trousers,nhis tie loosened only slightly and one dark lock of hair fallingnacross his forehead. \"Robert!\" she gasped. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Asking a lady to dance.\" \"No, I meant—\" \"I know what you meant.\" He held out his hand, andnbefore she could check herself, she gave him hers. He pulled herngently out onto the floor. \"I came with Lord Stockbridge. He finished up his business innthe city, and decided to join the family. We only just got in an hournago, and he gave me my leave to come to the party. Anyway, I thoughtnyou liked surprises.\" His eyes creased at the corners as hensmiled. \"I must say, though, I feel a bit underdressed.\" She blushed as his eyes travelled from the top of her head down tonwhere her scuffed toes peeked from below her hem. \"Then again, I have seen you in less,\" he whispered innher ear, his breath stirring her hair. She shivered. \"Are youncold?\" \"No.\" She met his eyes boldly. \"Not cold.\" Shencould feel the heat of his skin where his hands rested lightly at hernhip and shoulder, and he pulled her closer. From where she sat by the door, Mrs Wilson's eyes fixed on them asnthey danced. Robert saw Mary glance over his shoulder, his eyesntracing her gaze until they rested on Wilson. \"Even at a party, she's like a crow, all in black. Gives menthe willies.\" \"You shouldn't say such things,\" Mary scolded him. \"Why not?\" He laughed merrily. \"If she wants anturn, she'll have to wait. My dance card is currently full up.\" Mary's hand tightened on his shoulder as she saw the housekeepernrise and flee the ballroom. \"Jane!\" Mrs Croft called after her, and Robert froze atnthe sound of her name. The other dancers milled around them, but theynremained stock still in the centre of the floor. \"Robert, don't—\" Mary whispered fiercely, and henlooked at her in wonder. All at once his dark green eyes went widenfrom shock, then narrowed in anger. He released her as if her touched burned him. \"Robert, please ,\" Mary whispered as he steppednaway from her. His face a carved mask, he bowed to her stiffly andnthen stalked out of the ballroom. With the servants' ball not yet half over, the garret rooms werendeserted. Mary made her way to Robert's room without thinking ofnanything except the look on his face as he'd left her. Anger, hurt,nbetrayal. But more than that, it was as if his entire life hadncrumbled before her eyes. She didn't knock but walked straight in. The sense of deja-vunalmost overwhelmed her as she saw him bring the match to the end ofnhis cigarette, and take a long drag. His jacket hung on a peg on thenwall, and his white shirt was half unbuttoned. Her eyes darted to the photograph sitting in its frame by the sidenof the bed. The glass was broken, and the photo lay face-down on thentable. She could see faint writing across the back, but was too farnaway to make out the words. Next to it was his toothbrush glass, anninch of dark amber liquid still in the bottom. \"You knew, and you didn't tell me. You knew .\" She shook her head. \"I didn't. Not until after you'd gone.nAnd it wasn't my secret to tell,\" she said firmly, lifting hernchin a fraction of an inch higher. \"Robert, you can't blamenher.\" \"Why can't I? What son can't blame his mother for leaving himnin that hellhole—\" \"She didn't know. Until you said at dinner—about thenorphanage. He told her you'd been adopted. He said—he told all ofnthem the same thing. The same lie, over and over.\" Her voice wasna ragged whispered, as if even now she was afraid someone wouldnoverhear. \"He said he knew a good family, that you'd be adoptedninto a good family. That's why she gave you up, to have a life shencouldn't give you. She never knew. Think. Remember .\" He sagged, despair writ across his face as he sat down on the endnof the bed, scrubbing a hand across his suddenly weary features. Thencigarette clutched in his fingers went out, ash dropping unheeded tonthe shabby carpet. \"She was alive. I did all this... for her, and she was alive .\" Without making eye contact, Robert picked up thenglass and drained it. \"You didn't do anything,\" Mary said desperately, andnflinched as the glass smashed against the wainscoting, and he graspednher by the upper arms. \"I killed a man, for her,\" he said savagely. \"No,\" Mary said, shaking her head. \"She killed anman for you .\" She stumbled backwards as he released her, clenching andnunclenching his fists at her side. But she wasn't afraid. She didn'tnknow him well, but she knew him well enough. \"Sir William was poisoned. Before you stabbed him, SirnWilliam was poisoned,\" Mary reminded him, her voice gentle. \"Shendid it all for you. To keep you safe. That's what your mother did fornyou.\" \"My mother,\" he repeated, staring up at her.nTentatively, she reached out to cup his cheek in her outstretchednhand. \"She loved you, Robert. She loves you still.\" She's not the only one , Mary wanted to say, but didn't. Henstared up at her, and everything shifted as he turned a fraction andnpressed a kiss into her palm. There was a moment when she could have turned back. Changedncourse. As she stood there, gazing down at him, the moment passed. She stepped closer to him as his hand came up to run fingers alongnthe outside of her arm. He didn't stand. Instead, she came forwardnuntil her knees hit the edge of the bed and she bent down to kissnhim. His arms came around her waist, pulling her against his chest asnhe fell back onto the candlewick bedspread. He rained kisses on hernbared shoulders, tongue teasing the spot where her neck joined hernshoulder. One strap of her dress slid down her shoulder with gentlenpressure from his thumb, and he ran his hand along the top of hernbreasts, fingers extended so he could feel as much of her exposednskin as possible. She gasped, eyes squeezed tightly shut, and hencaught her bottom lip between his teeth. Then they were kissing as ifnthey meant to devour one another, the entire length of her bodynpressed tightly against his. The lace of her dress caught on thenbuttons of his shirt, and she reached between them to undo them withnone hand. He pulled back, dark green eyes half-lidded and heavy. \"Mary—\" \"Everyone's downstairs,\" she breathed against his mouth. His hands slid up her thighs until the dress was bunch almostnaround her waist. In one movement she tugged it over her head, andntossed it to the floor where it lay in a pool of green satin,nforgotten. \"I never thought I'd see you again,\" Mary said as Robertnran his fingers lazily up and down her arm. \"I mean... I thoughtnyou'd leave service.\" \"I've been in service my whole life. I don't know how to donanything else. A proper job, I mean.\" Robert shrugged. \"Andnanyway... if I left service, I'd never see you again.\" She rested her head on his shoulder, closing her eyes. \"What do we do now?\" \"I've got a bit put aside—it's not much, but it's enoughnfor a bedsit.\" Mary shook her head, eyes pricking with tears. \"I send halfnmy wages home to my Mam. My sisters aren't old enough to work, andnthe boys are just babies. They need me.\" \"What if I need you?\" he said softly, his breathnstirring her hair. The comb that had held her hair away from her facenlay on the bedside table, atop the photograph. Robert pushed her hairnbehind her ear, his hand lingering, his thumb tracing the curve ofnher cheek. She was silent, and he sighed. \"The dancing will go until gone 4, May said. Most of thenmaids don't even go to bed, she said. Her ladyship won't need mentonight.\" \"And tomorrow?\" \"Tomorrow, everything will go back to normal.\" \"Normal,\" he echoed, incredulous. She smiled, andnreached up to push the lock of hair that fell across his foreheadnback. There was a light knock at the door. Jane Wilson opened the door in her dressing gown. Her eyes werenred-rimmed, but her back was ramrod straight. \"How can I help you, Mr Stockbridge?\" Robert Parks stepped forward, and gently closed the door behindnhim.

Carpe Diem by TaranO'Shea Mary MacEachran was a good girl. Everyone said so. \"Mary is a good girl, hardworking, not given to flights ofnfancy or wearing make-up. She is a decent, biddable girl who would donany household proud,\" her mother had written in her firstnreference, when Mary was a skinny girl who still wore her hair innplaits, and shared a bed with her two sisters. They had been desperate for the money. Her sisters Eliza and Moiranwere too young to work, and Mam had just had her second son scarcelyna year after the first. Mary had left school when her da died, tonhelp raise them. But the extra mouth to feed was more than Mam's jobntaking in laundry could support. Like most girls her age, servicenseemed the only answer. She'd been taught dressmaking at school, andnher mam had written an agency in Edinburgh known for placing Scottishngirls in English households, asking if there was a place for her innLondon. Mary had wanted to find a place in Glasgow, to stay close to home.nNo hiring fairs for her Mary, Mam had said. \"You're toonwell-brought-up for that,\" she said, patting Mary's hand. Hernmother's hands were chapped red and raw, but Mary remembered as anchild how soft they had been. Her mother had worked her whole life innservice. It had given her an eye for fine things, and a dream of anbetter life for her children than that of a skivvy or tweenie. Miss Fairbairn had written back straight away to say the Countessnof Trentham was in need of a lady's maid and was willing to take hernon so long as she understood, as a trainee, she would only be earningn₤18 a year. Since she had no French, and no experience as even anschoolroom maid, it was the best offer she could hope to receive. Packing what little she owned into a single battered case, shenleft home with a second-hand wool coat, a pair of black shoes withnCuban heels, a blue dress for mornings, and a black dress fornafternoons folded carefully between sheets of tissue paper. Both werentoo large on her, and she had made them over as best she could, sincenthey didn't have the money to buy fabric to make them new. Her lastnact of putting childish things aside had been to have her hairnbobbed. She'd hoped cutting her long hair would make her seem older.nBut instead of looking smart, Mary feared it made her seem evennyounger. London had seemed impossibly far away, but Mary had kissed hernsiblings good-bye, and held back her tears until the train pulled outnof the station. When she wrote her letters, twice a week withoutnfail, she never said how much she hated London. How everyone askednher to repeat everything she said because they claimed they couldn'tnunderstand her accent. How Mary had her tea with the housekeepernbefore she went upstairs to fetch Lady Trentham's clothes out of herndressing room because the head housemaid, Sarah, was supposed tonbring Mary her tea in the morning. But Sarah was three years Mary'snsenior, and it was awkward and uncomfortable. She never told her sisters how much she missed them preciselynbecause none of the other housemaids liked her, or even talked tonher, because they were afraid she'd go telling tales to the Mistress. The truth was Mary had been too frightened of the Countess ofnTrentham to tell any tales. When she was prodded by her ladyship fornservant's hall gossip, she merely flushed, and tried to keep her eyesnon her work, saying, \"Nothing of import, my lady.\" Itnalways frustrated Lady Trentham, who would be short with her for thenrest of the afternoon. Mary was a good girl, never complaining if Lady Trentham wentnthrough five sets of clothing in a day and she spent half her daynpressing and mending. Lady Trentham only ever complimented Mary once.nTheir last night at Gosford, she had sat Mary down and complimentednher on how she managed \"those horrible little men\" who hadnquestioned her about Sir William's allowance. Mary had sat, handsnfolded in her lap, unsure of what to say or do. Keeping Lady Trentham's cuffs clean was easy. She'd even learntnhow to pack and unpack her cases to her satisfaction. She rememberednto tell her ladyship her stockings came from France, even if theynwere plain black stockings from Marks & Spencers. She rememberednto keep extra hairpins in the pocket of her black apron, and shennever forgot them after the first time. But Mary had never been praised before for being an excellentnliar. Merriman tells her she's kind, when she brings him sweet milky teanas he tunes Lady Trentham's motor out in the cold and damp. Marynnever once lets the smile slide off her face even though she onlynbrought it to him because she wanted to go outside with Elsie andncouldn't think of a way do it unless she attached a bit of work tonit. She remembered Robert appearing in the billiard room with LadynTrentham's hot water bottle. How she had hugged it to her chest,nfeeling as if she'd been given flowers, chocolate, and all thosenthings she'd never dreamt of before, all from the light in his eyesnand his easy smile. She remembers how, when the police said he wasn't interested innthe servants, only people with a real connection to the dead man, thenfinal tumbler had clicked for her. Every man and woman in that roomnknew that Elsie had been having an affair with Sir William. To a man,nthey said not a word. Because Elsie had been one of their own, and nonmatter what they might have felt, they would never betray one ofntheir own. Robert had met her eyes, and smiled, and she had realisedntwo things. The first was how much she cared for him. The second wasnthat Robert had murdered a man in cold blood. She thinks of Mrs Wilson, in her grey dress and white lace collar.nUnchanging, like one of the pillars that held up the world. Shenthinks of how she confessed to murder as she checked the table linen,nher grey hair waved and held in place with plain pins. Most of all, Mary thinks of how Mrs Wilson never asked Mary how anlady's maid knew Robert kept her photograph by his bed. Mary lets herself remember sometimes how he tasted. Cigarettes andna hint of whisky from the bottle Denton had left in the room when hisncharade had been discovered. Alone in her attic bedroom, at the topnof Countess of Trentham's estate while the November wind howlednoutside and shook the trees in the park, Mary's fingers trace hernbottom lip as she closes her eyes shut and remembers every detail. The first thing she remembers are his bare feet. He'd taken offnhis shoes and socks as he lay atop the duvet, reading. She didn'tnthink she'd ever seen a grown man's bare feet before. It had shockednher with how something so simple could seem so intimate. She remembers the look of surprise, when she'd entered the room.nThe way his eyes had widened with something like wonder. How loud thenclick of the door latching behind her had seemed, thought she couldnscarcely hear it above the hammering of her heart in her ears. He still wore his striped trousers. His vest had been untucked,nhis bracers pulled down over his shoulders to hang at either side.nThe thin cotton was threadbare, loose from so many washings, butnstill dazzlingly white. Because it was worn next to his skin, itncould be shabby, and no-one would ever see it. There had been a lightndusting of dark hair above the frayed neck. She remembers the way the muscles of his arms shifted beneath hisnskin as he'd risen from the bed. The sound of the match hitting thenmetal ashtray, the smoke curling lazily in the air. Her eyes had stung, but not from smoke. How he'd come closer and closer, his eyes never leaving her face.nThe languid grace in the way he moved. She should have beennterrified. She should have turned tail and run. She'd come therenbecause she needed to know why he'd killed a man. But she'd steppednthrough that door knowing he had. Or at least believing he had. Shenshould have been afraid of him. She'd taken two steps back, but that was as far as she moved.nBecause she hadn't been afraid of him. She'd been apprehensive of hisnanswer, but she still couldn't bring herself to fear Robert. And itnwasn't fear that pinned her to the spot. It was something else. Itnhad been as if he'd caught her with his gaze. Like a fish in a net,nor a butterfly in a jar. She remembered the smile, as he'd told her he didn't care who hadnmurdered Sir William. The way his eyes had crinkled at the corners asnhe assured her he didn't care . A single lock of dark hair hadnfallen across his brow, making him seem younger. She remembers how Robert had pulled her close with one arm,ncigarette still held between his fingers, like a character in a film.nHow she'd felt the tip of his tongue briefly against hers before he'dnreleased her. How the ash had fallen to the carpet, because his handnwas shaking. She remembers that fraction of a second after he'd kissed her,nbefore he'd gasped. Before he'd told her he'd been wanting to kissnher from the moment he'd first seen her. In that space where the second hand travelled, she could havenchanged everything. Alone in her bed, she tries to imagine what it would have beennlike, if things had been different. Imagines what would have happenednif she'd kissed him back. Would he have let her go scurrying backndown the steps, if she'd opened her mouth to his? Would he have wanted her then, if she hadn't been the prim littlenmaid, too shy and frightened to do anything but run away? She might have been innocent, but she wasn't ignorant. Footmennwere always dallying with the housemaids, grounds-keepers withnkitchen maids. The last thing any girl remained for long, in service,nwas blind to the ways of men and women. But Mary had never had anfollower. She'd never even gone to any of the village dances with thenother maids. She'd been shocked by Bertha in the ironing room, notnbecause she'd never seen how it is between men and women. But becausenshe couldn't imagine doing that in the servants' hall wherenjust anyone could walk in. But alone in his room, the bedding folded neatly on Henry's emptynbed, not a soul there to stop them? That she could imagine. Shencloses her eyes, and imagines his mouth on hers. Can almost feel hisnhair beneath her fingers. Night after night, she closes her eyes andnsees his. And she knows if she were truly a good girl, she would havenbeen glad to see the back of him and never spared him a secondnthought after Mr Merriman had pulled the motor away from Gosford Parknthat bright November morning. Next time , she tells herself in the dark, shocked at hownbold she is. Next time, things will be different. Robert Parks was not a good man. No-one who truly has murder innhis heart can, he thinks, pretend to be good. But growing up in a Percy House had made him the man he was today.nBack then, the children who lived there were called \"inmates\".nLike it was a prison. Or an insane asylum. He never forgot that.nScratch the surface of the well-groomed valet, and just beneath thatnthin veneer of civilisation was an angry boy who had learnt to usenhis fists before he'd learnt to use his brain or his tongue. When he was fourteen, he and Billy and Ned had broken into thenwarden's office to steal their files. In his had been his birthncertificate. All he knew was that he had been born to Jane Parks innthe maternity ward of Warkworth House. Where his father's name shouldnhave been, it had been neatly typed 'father not known'. There was anphotograph in his file, too. A girl—she couldn't have been morenthan twenty—with hair swept back and wearing a plain, high-neckednwhite frock. Written across the back was Jane, '96 in anspidery hand. The matron had told him his mother had died of drink. As a boy,nhe'd spun that horrible truth into something better. Something hencould live with. Robert's mother Jane had died of a broken heart. Henhad told himself that for so long, he actually believed it. He'd kept her photo in its cheap cardboard frame, tucked betweennthe pages of a copy of a Dumas novel. When he got his first job as anhallboy at Shugborough House, in Staffordshire, he'd slept with itnunder his pillow. He'd never left London in his life, but there werenjobs going because of the war. The blue sky had amazed him. The worknwas hard, but the best thing about it was it put him in a position tonhear all of the gossip in the servants' hall. Because he served thenPugs' Parlour, he would hear not just the dinner conversations of thenbutler, housekeeper, his lordship's valet and her ladyship's maid,nhead housemaid and footmen—but visiting servants. While carrying coal through the kitchens during a shootingnweek-end, he heard a visiting valet tell tales of how his employernhad four factories outside London—two in Isleworth, and two innTwickenham. The valet was new to his service, having been previous anfootman in Lord Carton's household. But one of Carton's daughters hadnmarried the man for his money, and she was doing her best to whip himninto fine enough shape to be presentable at state functions. A gangly boy of fifteen, having just had his first real growthnspurt, Robert then learnt that the under-housemaids were where younwent for the real stories. Ella, seventeen and with an ample bosom,nshared more than just her gossip with him. But it was from Ella henfirst learnt that as a young man Mr McCordle had met the Countess,nLady Coke at one of the Maharajah's famed shooting parties. In hushednwhispers, she'd told him how Mr McCordle had been more than just thenowner of the factory Robert's mother had worked in, before she died.nHe had got up to all sorts of trouble. But no-one ever caused anstink, because he was richer than God. The only reason he wasn't offnin France was because he'd greased all the right palms, and thosenfactories were full of girls whose fathers, husbands, brothers andnsons were off fighting the Huns. After the Earl was killed in a shooting accident, Robert begannlooking for a place as a footman in town. He was taller than mostnyoung men his age, and this gave him an advantage. Conscription meantnhe could have his pick of places, though he always had an eye towardsnFrance. What the war began, the Spanish Flu finished. As a tall,nstrong, courteous, and pleasing to look at young man, he had his picknof work from almost anywhere in the country due to a cripplingnshortage of male servants. By the time Robert was 20, he was a second footman, and had annidea about life in service, and an idea about his life .nBecause as he travelled from household to household, what he learntnhe was best at was keeping himself to himself, doing his job as bestnhe could, and listening . And it was by keeping his eyes andnears open in the servants' hall and when he served at table that henlearnt the only way he could get to the man he suspected was hisnfather and his mother's murderer was to become a valet. Valetsnshadowed their masters, had access to them at all hours, and gotnclose enough to them to slip a knife between their ribs. That was what he dreamt about, in his draughty room he shared withnthe first footman at the top of the house. Of seeing McCordle's eyesnwiden in shock. How the blood would run down the handle of the bladenas he would slump towards him. The gruesome image brought himncomfort. He knew he was sick. Knew it in the pit of his stomach as henlay on his side, listening to the sounds of London outside the tinynwindow. But by the time he took his first position as valet, it begannchanging from idle fantasy to the stirrings of a plan. He never stayed in a position more than two years. He never gavencause for dismissal. He never dallied with his master's wives orndaughters. He went to the pictures now and then with housemaids, andnwas hardly a monk. But on the whole, he formed no lastingnattachments. He was well-known, and if not precisely liked, then atnleast respected. He was always given a good reference, and only oncenwas he ever spoken with for his behaviour. He'd been serving at one of her ladyship's grand parties, andnoverheard one of her guests ask if she could recommend a staffingnagency for him, as his household was in need of an in-between maid.nExcept he hadn't called her a tweenie—he'd actually called her anskivvy, which was bad enough. But when her ladyship asked if he wasnlooking for any type of girl in particular, the man had replied \"Oh,nany little slut will do.\" Only the butler's hand on his arm had stopped Robert from scaldingnthe man with the hot sauce he'd been serving. He had been immediately taken outside, where he explained what henhad overheard tersely and plainly, unable to fully hide his disgustnand fury. To his credit, the butler had blanched, and then fetchednhim a glass of port. He was made to sit in the butler's pantry tondrink it and calm down, and told not to return to table until he feltnhe could—and then only if he felt he could. It was ankindness Robert never forgot. But it also served as a reminder of hownsome men saw the world, and all the money and prestige couldn'tndisguise their black hearts. Any remorse he'd ever felt at demonisingnhis father vanished, to be replaced with firm resolve. He thinks he's God Almighty, he'd told Mary when she askednhim what Lord Stockbridge was like. They all do , he'd said asnmuch about McCordle as Stockbridge, and by extension every man in thenupper classes. And he believed it, because nothing in his life hadnshown him any different. Slowly, he began working his way closer to his goal. He triednstaffing agencies, but it became too difficult to try and explain whynhe wanted this position over that position based not on rises in pay,nbut proximity to Sir William McCordle, newly made Baronet. Lucky fornhim, servants halls had a healthy trade in gossip. When McCordle'snbrother-in-law Lord Stockbridge's valet died, Robert saw it as hisnopportunity. When he had first set foot in Gosford Park, his mind had been fullnof the plan. He'd spent the first day doing nothing but learning thenlayout of the house, and Sir William's routine. He noted who stayednlate in the drawing room playing cards, who among the footmen wasnmost likely to lose or misplace any of the silver. Who would marknhim, if he walked into a room, and who would dismiss him, too busynwith their own work. But all the while, he was preoccupied withnthoughts of Lady Trentham's maid. He remembers how Friday afternoon, as Mrs Wilson was telling himnwhere he'd be billeted, behind the head housemaid had stood a slip ofna girl in a grey cloche hat and wet wool coat. Her brown hair wasndamp, and clung to her cheeks. He'd assumed she was annunder-housemaid, at first. She seemed so young, and so unlike thenlady's maids he knew, who were generally a bit full of themselves.nShe'd blushed as she'd admitted she had no experience, and he'd beenncompletely charmed. \"These are your stairs here,\" Elsie had said,neffectively dismissing him. Mary had stood two steps behind her, darkneyes following him until he disappeared around a corner. He didn'tnsee her again until they were in the ironing room, pressing theirnmasters' clothes for the night. Her hair was pulled back from hernface with two hairpins, and she wore a plain black frock. She wasnslim, and lovely, if not conventionally pretty. He'd asked her name.nWhen she said in all earnestness while she was at there, her name wasnTrentham, he couldn't hold back a laugh. That night, he'd stolen the silver carving knife and hidden it innthe fire bucket at the foot of the servants stairs closest to thenlibrary. He knew from George using the fire buckets to hide hisnillicit fag ends that no-one ever checked them. It was nearly midnight by the time he started back up to his room.nHe heard the scuffle and Mary's unmistakable voice raised in alarm,nand quickened his step. As he'd opened the door she'd been directlynin front of him, eyes bright with tears, and two splotches of colournhigh on her cheeks. Denton was smoothing down his waistcoat, and hisnblond hair was mussed. She'd started to move past him, and Robert hadnput out a hand to touch her arm, as he told her to wait. He remembered the warmth of her skin where his thumb brushed hernwrist, below the cuff. He remembered how she had been shaking, refusing to meet his eyes.nHe remembered how Denton's eyes had followed him, daring him to makenan accusation. Only the thought of the knife buried beneath the sandnin the fire bucket kept him from smashing Denton's face in with hisnfists. \"You sound as if you don't like him,\" Mary had said whennhe told her how he couldn't understand why Elsie would let a man likenWilliam McCordle touch her. \"You'd be surprised.\" \"Alright. Surprise me.\" Her eyes had challenged him. When the moment came, he hadn't hesitated. He'd plunged the silvernknife into his father's heart. Unlike his vivid imaginings, there had been no blood. That shouldnhave warned him. But he had been so caught up in the moment, thenculmination of his life's work, he hadn't noticed. He'd reached down,npulling off one green baize glove, and felt Sir William's throat forna pulse. Satisfied there was none, he'd calmly walked back to thenkitchens. The muddy shoes went back outside the kitchen door wherenthey belonged. Music still poured from the drawing room, and hallnboys and scullery maids littered the main stairs, eyes closed innrapture as they'd listened to the piano drifting down from above.nFighting the urge to whistle, he busied himself with filling two hotnwater bottles with boiling water from the huge kettle that hung overnthe fire in the kitchen, to cover his absence. One for LordnStockbridge, one for Lady Trentham. They had embroidered covers, asnif their delicate peer's skin was too fine to touch with mortalnthings. It wasn't until he overheard one of the kitchen maids in thengarden joking about Sir William being murdered twice that he'dnrealised he'd killed a dead man. He should have felt cheated of his revenge. Instead, he found onlyna profound sense of peace that the deed was done. The rest of thenhouse—above and belowstairs—had been tense, worried, guardingntheir own secrets. But for the first time in his life, Robert felt free . When Inspector Thompson had announced they would not beninterviewing the servants, he'd met Mary's eyes across the table withna genuine smile. Because while he had always had something henbelieved worth killing and dying for, for the first time, he felt henhad something to live for. He'd never imagine a future beyond his father's death. An expansenof possibility stretched out before him now, and somehow, all hencould think of was her . Back in London, the quarrelling Lord and Lady Stockbridge nonlonger at each other's throats, Robert had settled back into hisndaily routine. But in the wee hours of the night, as he slippednoutside to have a cigarette and watch the clouds passing over thenface of the moon, he thinks of her. He remembers the timid knock at his door. How, when he had lookednup from his book and saw her, it had felt as if the universe hadncracked in half. Everything had shifted, and nothing felt the same.nIn her night-dress with her flannel dressing-gown tied loosely aroundnher waist, he ought not to have seen her as anything but a child. He'd dropped the novel he'd been reading to the bed, lit ancigarette to give himself something to do with his hands. He droppednthe match looked at her from over his shoulder—from her bobbed hairnto her bare feet stuck in her black shoes without socks. And in thatnmoment, he knew he was no better than Henry Denton, because more thannanything, he wanted to feel her beneath him on the narrow bed. Instead, he tells her the truth. He's never told a living soul,nbut she's standing there with tears in her brown eyes, and he handsnher the photograph. The truth was a drug, making him light-headed.nThe desire to kiss her burned in his throat like unshed tears. She'snlooked up at him with fear and hope and he wanted so desperately tontouch her. So he did. He remembered how she had looked up at him, as they parted. Hernhand had hovered near his chest, but never touched him. In thatnmoment, he could have changed everything. He could have kissed hernagain. Instead, he'd let her go. \"I've been wanting to do that ever since I first set eyes onnyou.\" He'd wanted to be gentle. To woo her. But in that moment, he wasnno better than his father. He taken what he wanted. And she'd runnfrom him. He'd started at the door, feeling lost and alone in a waynhe hadn't since he'd been a boy. Next time , he whispers to the cold winter air. Next time, things will be different.

A/N: Feedback of any and all kind is much appreciated. Don't worry, you won't hurt my feelings. This falls under one of two categories that I tend to write in: obscure femslash. The only time the house was ever really quiet was when almost everyone had gone to the country for the shooting party, the men first and the women slightly later for lunch. Even at night after everyone upstairs had retired for the night, and all the servants downstairs finally managed to fall into their respective beds, there was a fair amount of creeping about. Mrs. Wilson never seemed to sleep; the sharp clack of her shoes in the corridor was a perpetual constant. And after Mary had gone to the ironing room to wash the Lady Trentham's shirt the previous night, she was certain that one of the upstairs men had come down to carry on with one of the kitchen maids. So Mary had seized the first quiet opportunity to make her way to the shared bathroom in the female servant's quarters. It would be at least several more hours until the hunting party returned to change for the evening supper. Then she would be busy dressing the Lady Trentham, sharing the latest gossip she had garnered from the servants, preparing her for supper. By the time she helped the aged Countess into her dressing gown and turned the bed down, there would be a queue for the baths. It seemed more sensible to bathe now, while she had the chance. She started the water, tested it with a hand. She adjusted the water before realizing it wasn't going to get any warmer; at least it was warm enough that she wouldn't be frozen by the time she got out. Carefully, she folded her clothing on a chair next to the tub, as carefully as she would have folded one of the Lady Trentham's expensive frocks. When she finally slipped into the water, she sighed. Resting her head on the edge of the tub, she allowed her eyes to flutter shut for a blessed moment. It was a moment of quiet relief. For a breath, she wasn't worried that she hadn't laid out the Lady Trentham's evening dress, or that perhaps she had forgotten to do some vital task, and she simply relaxed. It was intimidating. Mary thought, sitting up and began washing her body. She wasn't nearly as experienced as any of the other lady's maids or valets or footmen. She had only been in service half a year, which was nowhere near comparable to the others who had spent their entire lives in service. It seemed as if everything she did was a mistake, that the others were watching her disapprovingly. Everyone was so confident. The door creaked open and Mary flinched to cover herself with the woefully inadequate washing cloth. Flushing, she glanced up to see Elsie, the head housemaid enter wearing her robe, towel slung casually over her arm. \"Shut the door, for heaven's sake!\" Mary hissed, both simultaneously relieved that is was only Elsie and agitated at the intrusion. The taller, blond woman smirked. \"Don't worry, it's only Lewis and Dorothy.\" She said indicating the line that had formed for the bath with a tilt of her head, but she obliged and shut the door behind her. \"If any of the men get found up here, they get sacked on the spot. Worse luck.\" She added reassuringly as she crossed the room and moved Mary's clothes to a hook on the wall before setting down her towel. Mary didn't answer, still feeling self-conscious around the older woman. She had been grateful that she was rooming with Elsie, who was so much more experienced and wiser than Mary was. She'd taken Mary under her wing, so to speak, filling her in on all the necessary knowledge of the house. Who was married to whom, who had scandalous dealings with Sir William, what Lady Sylvia was really like. She exuded a confidence that matched any of the aristocracy of those that lived upstairs. Grateful for the assistance, Mary was also flattered that the head housemaid had chosen to help her. She might have easily ignored her as the rest of the servants did. \"So don't tell me, you're a convent girl.\" Elsie teased, prompting Mary from her thoughts. \"Or is that Presbyterian modesty?\" Shoulders still hunched, hiding her bareness, Mary glanced over her shoulder and saw that Elsie had shed her robe. The pale green silk shift she wore was nearly sheer, and clung to her body like a delicate veil worn for the appearance of modesty but leaving a great deal visible. Feeling her face flush again, Mary quickly looked away. She'd admired other women before. But Elsie made her feel as if the room was too hot. Her heart beat too rapidly in her chest, and she felt even more awkward than usual. \"Is the water hot?\" \"Not really.\" \"No,\" Elsie sat on the chair and pulled out a cigarette. \"It won't be until the guns get back. I'd better get in yours.\" The wall in front of Mary suddenly went blurry. And despite what she had just told Elsie, the water seemed to her to be very hot. Struggling to take a breath, she held it, realizing that the housemaid hadn't meant in the bath with her, but after her. Anxiously, she attempted to change the subject, worried that Elsie might find her silence suspicious. \"Her Ladyship says that Sir William loves his shooting.\" She said hastily, feeling foolish the moment the words left her lips. If Elsie noticed Mary's distress, she said nothing. \"Yeah, he does. Can't hit a barn door, but he does love it.\" She put a cigarette between her lips. \"It's quite sweet really.\" For the first time, Mary turned and half-faced her friend. \"Elsie?\" \"Yeah?\" In turn the blond woman turned and faced her. \"Last night—\" She hesitated unsure if she should continue. She desperately wanted to impress the older woman, but gossiping seemed such a mean activity. \"What?\" Elsie prompted, striking a match to light the cigarette which was still dangling between her lips. \"No, I shouldn't say.\" \"Yes, you should. What?\" The smile was audible in Elsie's voice, as was the eagerness. All gossip about the goings-on upstairs was greeted by a hungry enthusiasm by the servants. And the head housemaid was no exception. Gnawing on the inside of her cheek, Mary thoughtfully shifted again, raising dark brown eyes to meet Elsie's pale blue. \"Well, when I went down to wash that shirt, I think I saw him in the ironing room.\" She lowered her voice to a whisper. \"He was with one of the kitchen maids.\" \"No, that wouldn't have been him.\" Elsie shook her head. \"I think it was. He came down the passage a minute later, and I don't see how--\" Elsie took a long, pointed drag on her cigarette and stood, interrupting Mary. \"No. It wasn't him.\" She repeated sharply with an edge of finality in her voice. Flinching as if she had been struck, Mary dropped her head, wondering what she had that caused Elsie's tone. So much for impressing her. Dismally, Mary finished washing herself and climbed from the tub. The two women exchanged places, Mary unable to resist watching as Elsie pulled the light shift over her head while holding her cigarette aloft with one hand. Her skin was light, milk pale where the sun never touched. Feeling her breath hitch as Elsie lowered herself into the tub, water lapping at the swell of her breasts, Mary turned and began drying her hair, hiding her face with the towel. A sharp surge of pleasure started at her groin and coursed through her body from her shoulders to her toes, unbidden, almost like a strong stab of pain. It was unlike any sensation Mary had ever experienced, unique and wonderful as much as it was embarrassing. No matter what, she was not so naive as to not know what that feeling had been. Ignoring the beautiful woman behind her, she dried herself and pulled on her robe. Clearing her throat, she resumed her place on the same chair Elsie had been sitting in. \"You know how you said Sir William could've had his pick… Between Lady Sylvia and Lady Stockbridge?\" \"Aye.\" Elsie stretched out in the tub, her head resting on the edge and her eyes half shut, displaying none of the self-consciousness Mary had. \"Well, I asked her Ladyship about it. And she said, they cut cards for him.\" Elsie sat up and turned, resting both arms on the side of the tub, grinning incredulously. \"No!\" Mary returned the grin with one of her own, feeling a warm flutter in her stomach. \"I know.\" She said happily, pleased that she had managed to pique the head housemaid's curiosity. Suddenly, she did not feel so awkward and out of place. In fact, she had found out something that not even Elsie had known. \"I can't believe it either. Do you suppose it was a joke?\" \"Well, I wouldn't be too sure.\" Elsie said finally, after considering it with another short inhalation from her cigarette. \"You know what I heard?\" She started, and then turned her head huffing in disgust. \"Oh, just listen to me. Why do we spend our lives living through them?\" She asked, disdainfully, leaning back again to the rear of the tub. \"I mean, look at poor old Lewis.\" Elsie continued as Mary stood and went to the mirror to brush her still wet bangs from her face. \"If her own mother had a heart attack, she'd think it was less important than one of Lady Sylvia's farts.\" Staring at her reflection in the mirror, Mary hesitated. It seemed completely natural to her that they discussed their employers. After that, what really was there to speak about? She hadn't done anything important or interesting, unless one considered lighting an old Countess's cigarettes and fastening her necklaces as important. Nothing in her life was as interesting as cutting cards for a rich husband, or a business going under. Mary simply did what she was told and hardly had the opportunity for anything noteworthy or scandalous. When she was old, would two young maids speak of her like they did Lewis? Would they only refer to her as the lady's maid to the Countess? It was a terrifying thought, even to Mary who was most happy when no one noticed her. She might not want people staring at her, but neither did she want to die a vague wisp of a human being, nothing more than a shadow of her employer. She wanted there to be something in her life that could be said that Mary Maceachran did herself. Turning, she crossed the narrow breadth between the wall and the tub, dropped to her knees at the edge. Her mouth suddenly as dry as swab of cotton, she swallowed and dropped her eyes when she noticed that Elsie was staring at her expectantly. It was a struggle to raise her gaze back to the older woman's, but she refused to keep her eyes downcast. It was Elsie, not one of those snobbish people from upstairs. \"Why don't we live our lives through ourselves, then?\" Mary finally managed to meet Elsie's steady blue eyes, trying not to sound as timid as she felt. Quirking a brow, Elsie leaned forward slightly. \"What do you mean, then?\" Biting her lower lip, Mary pushed herself forward on her knees, closing the gap between them swiftly, knowing if she moved slowly she would never actually muster the courage to do it. She pressed her lips against Elsie's, framing her face gently with her hands. The older woman stiffened, her muscles tensing in surprise underneath Mary's kiss. Elsie's lips were soft and yielding, and she tasted not unpleasantly of cigarettes and tea. The kiss was brief, too brief, but shocked by her own audacity, Mary pulled away abruptly. For a moment, the two women simply stared at one another. Elsie's eyes were wide and unblinking. Mary still felt the pressure of the softness of their lips together. Mortified, Mary frantically moved to flee. How could she have been so stupid and impulsive? Elsie was going to hate her now; she would never be able to look the older woman in the eye again, or any of the other servants for that matter. She couldn't; she would be too ashamed that they might know, what their eyes might hold. And God forbid that the Lady Trentham might find out. Tears burned behind her eyes, and her heart no longer beat swiftly in her chest. It had slowed its rhythm to a measured agony. She turned to leave, unable to at Elsie's face, afraid of the revulsion she was sure to find there. A solid grasp on her upper arm pulled her back to the side of the tub. Unable to prevent the tears from spilling over, Mary reluctantly lifted her eyes to Elsie. There was none of the fury or repugnance Mary had been so certain of in the head housemaid's expression. Instead she found a calm curiosity, even as Elsie reached out and wiped away a tear from Mary's cheek with her thumb. The opposite hand still grasping Mary's arm, Elsie gradually pulled her closer until their lips met again. This time, the kiss lasted for much longer. And for the first time, Mary felt as if she had lived only for herself. ","Summary":" Title: Only Downstairs Pairing: Mary/Elsie Disclaimer: Not mine.

And Seas May Lie Between by TaranO'Shea Wormwood Scrubs Prison Cell #242 11 July, 1944 From the personal journal of Ivor Novello. My ordeal is almost at an end. As I sit here on this grubbyncot, staring at the grimy walls, I cannot help but feel a profoundnsense of relief that by this time tomorrow, I shall be back at thenflat with dear Bobbie and Olive at my side, as if the last four weeksnnever happened. It will be difficult to sit again in the Rolls-Roycenas Morgan drives me home, knowing that all this arose out of mynselfish and childish desire to get my own way. I shall never be ablento look at another petrol coupon the same way again, certainly. Inshudder still to think how I will be greeted by the world outsidenthese walls, but oh to see Bobbie again. And to go home. This I longnfor more than I ever thought possible. I have made one friend — if the type of acquaintance one cannmake among such sub-human creatures can in fact be called a friend —nat Wormwood Scrubs. He is a deserter turned black marketteer calledn\"Mad Frankie\" Fraser. He's the lowest sort of fellow, butnkind in his own way, though already a hardened criminal at scarcelyn20 years of age. Frankie makes sure he is at my side whenever thenbully-boy 'screws' (as he calls the guards) try and molest me, whichnthey dare not do when he is nearby. He asked me to autograph a slipnof paper for him to pass along to his dear mother, whom I can onlynthink of (without ever voicing such a thought, of course) as 'Mrs MadnFrankie'. Still, one must honour one's fans. Even when it was anfanatic (in the truest sense of the word) who put me in this ghastlynplace. Frankie noted, as I bid him farewell this evening, that it mustnhave been a shock to a man like me (by which I can only assume henmeans \"a man of the theatre\") to be incarcerated among suchnmen. That I must never have met anyone capable of killing anothernhuman being before being exiled to Wormwood Scrubs. Still, I chosennot to disabuse him of this quaint notion, because it came to me thennthat of course I had . What shocked me — to my core — however was not thenrealisation itself, so much as the acknowledgement that, even knowingnwhat I know now, I still thought of him fondly. Even after all thesenyears. I wonder whatever became of Robert Parks. Ivor almost didn't hear the knock. He was bent over a bowl filled with hot water, a towel over hisnhead and shoulders to trap the steam as he warmed up his vocal chordsnwhich protested due to a combination of fatigue and his usual dailynallotment of 60 Abdulla cigarettes. It had been a very long two days. Usually Ivor never went out with the guns, choosing instead tonspend the morning in bed and then go out with the ladies at luncheon.nHowever, Morris had asked him to come along, and he could hardly sendnhim out with just Henry. Used to props which fired blanks, Ivor hadnonly half-jokingly worried they might get winged by a passing shot.nThe charade — that Morris needed to attend the shoot as researchnfor his film — had to be maintained. As for Henry... well, Ivor hadnlittle doubt why Morris wanted him with him at all times. And Henrynwould have only sulked if left behind with nothing to do but smokenand read in the servants' hall. So he had been up with the sun it hadnseemed, and dinner felt like a midnight supper after all the day'snexcitement. Then of course there had been the murder. From the moment he'd seen the silver knife in William's chest,neverything had slid sidewise and become slightly unfocussed. As if henwere on a set, waiting for the director to call \"cut\" butnit just went on and on. Morris of course was mining it all for hisnscript, and Henry only seemed concerned his duplicity might arousensuspicion. But for Ivor, it meant losing something quite significant. NotnWilliam per se, but the idea of safety . During the Great War,nIvor had avoided being sent to the front by enlisting in the AirnCorps, at the suggestion of his dear friend Edie Marsh. There hadnbeen the assumption — never challenged by anything so mundane asnreality — after he'd crashed his second plane and they had assignednhim to a desk, that Ivor would witness no more death and destructionnfirst-hand. Not unless it was carefully scripted, all the bloodnred-dyed syrup which could simply be washed away afterwards. But there had been no blood, of course. That had made it all thenmore surreal. There William sat, grey-faced yet still appeared to bennothing more than asleep. The knife protruding from his ribcagenshattered the image of rest. It had affected Ivor deeply, and henhadn't fallen into bed until nearly dawn the next morning, and evennthen barely slept a wink. He would have liked nothing more than tonhave lain in bed all day, but instead had accompanied Morris tonbreakfast in the dining room a scant four hours after he'd strippednoff his boiled shirt and tails. Sylvia had called off the shooting, despite Raymond's belief thatnwhat they all really needed was something to keep their minds off thenterrible tragedy. The something in mind being of course trompingnthrough the rain-drenched grounds for hours on end, after a fewnbraces of pheasants. Ivor, however, believed that nothing short ofnanother war or losing a limb could force Stockbridge to miss a shoot.nThe beaters had milled around the stables all morning, in the hopesnthat they might be needed (and earn a day's wage) before they werendismissed and headed, grumbling, back to the village. The entirenschedule was thrown to the four winds, leaving everyone glumly makingnsmall talk in the salon, or hiding in their rooms as they awaited thendreaded summons by the police. Immediately after breakfast, Inspector Thompson had taken Ivorninto the library for the better part of an hour, but much of thenconversation had been one-sided, as the man tried to find commonnground to exploit between them. Apparently he had heard his mother'snchoir several times over the years, and thought the way to ingratiatenhimself to Ivor was by praising Clara as loudly and as often as hencould. It would have been better for him had Ivor not just the weeknbefore paid off yet another of his mother's creditors, this timeninvolving some mad scheme to relocate to New York. He adored his mam,nhe did. But she was not the path to his affections. Thompson's subordinate had managed to sneak a few questions in —nmainly asking who left the drawing room the night before, while Ivornwas playing. And how long had he played, had he noticed anyone goingnin or out. Ivor could only truthfully recall Freddie Nesbitt slinkingnoff while Mabel was left staring forlornly at the empty seat next tonIsabel at the bridge table. Ivor had felt sorry enough for her toninvite her to take a seat next to him at the piano, and then baskednin the fierce glow of her adoration. Quite the balm to his bruisednego after Raymond's remarks, and it had the added advantage ofnpositively infuriating Lady Trentham. That alone was reason enough tonbe kind to all the world's Mabels. Her knowing how a glove fit wasnmore practical knowledge of the world and how it worked than any ofnLord Carton's daughters had ever cultivated in their lives. Ivor longed for the solitude of his flat above the Strand theatre,nwhich he and Bobbie referred to only as \"The Flat\" as if itnwere the only flat in the world. Indeed, it sometimes was — his ownnprivate hide-a-way from sycophants and strangers, critics andncuriosity-seekers, and most of all the legions of young women whongathered outside the stage door like children seeking FathernChristmas. Instead, he was to stay at least another night in the country —nor more, if the investigation wasn't concluded swiftly. He'd wantednto call Bobbie, but the only phone was in the foyer, hardly the placenfor a private conversation. And he'd have to dislodge Morris, whichnwould be a feat in itself. At the second light knock, Ivor's reverie was at last broken, andnhe opened the door to a tall man in the ubiquitous dark suit of onenin service. \"You're Lord Stockbridge's man, aren't you?\" \"Parks, sir. Mr Jennings sent me to attend you, sir.\" Ivor stepped aside, admiring the valet's broad shoulders as henstepped into the cosy bedchamber that had been assigned him. Parksnwas tall — taller than Ivor, but only just. Most valets were tall,nof course, many having been hired as footmen specifically for theirnheight. And, Ivor thought with a small smile, their looks. Raymond's valet was no exception. His nose appeared to have beennbroken at least once, but it served only to lend his face characternas it emerged from the nebulousless of youth into maturity. While henwould never rival Ivor's profile, or the feminine beauty of Henry, henwas still pleasing to the eye with thick dark hair, clear skin, anstrong jaw line. Ivor placed him as perhaps ten years his junior,nfrom the lack of silver in his hair. \"I appreciate Jennings' concern, but there's no need,\"nIvor said graciously as he indicated his boiled shirt, tails, andntrousers hanging in the wardrobe. \"As you can imagine, I've beennlooking after myself these past few days.\" \"It's no bother, sir,\" Parks insisted, and for a momentnIvor was worried he was a fan. However Parks' body language and tonenwere respectful and deferent, but also above all unconcerned .nAs if it truly did not matter to the man whom he attended. Only thatnthe butler of the house had asked him, and he was doing his duty, ornso Ivor assumed. Ivor removed his dressing gown, feeling not the slightest bitnself-conscious as Parks' expression remained blandly disinterested asnhe took the tuxedo trousers from their hanger. A pity , Ivornthought absently as he laid a hand on Parks shoulder and stepped intonthe trousers. Handsome servants really are the best henhad told Morris the night before in the salon after the police hadngone. George, as always, had merely smirked. Ivor was sure the firstnfootman had his own war stories to tell where Sylvia was concerned.nHe had no fears of being indiscreet in this house. Say what you mightnabout Sylvia, she always hired the best servants. They probably knewnmore secrets than the organisation at Cromwell Road, but never anbreath of scandal passed their lips where anyone might hear. Well,nanyone who might tell anyone who might matter . \"I do hope that Henry's little charade wasn't too trying fornyou.\" \"Sir?\" Parks paused in the act of untying Ivor'sndressing gown with brisk efficiency. \"It was Morris' idea, I'm afraid. It's this film he's workingnon. Henry has ideas about playing one of the roles, and Morris isnindulging him.\" As the valet laid out Ivor's tuxedo shirt, Ivor noted that Parks'nhands were large, the nails immaculately clean as was expected. \"Anyway, when Henry approached him with the idea of taggingnalong to a proper manor house in the country, Morris thought it wouldnbe good research. William only went along with it I think because thenidea amused him for a moment. I don't think he really was interestednin films, truly. Just in having something of his own. An interest.\" \"As you say, sir.\" \"In any case, it was a foolish mistake. I hope it didn'tninconvenience anyone too much. Other than Sylvia, of course.\" Ivor considered the entire affair with Sylvia taking her pick ofnhandsome visiting servants as tiresome. It wasn't as if William wasnexactly lily-white when it came to availing himself of the favours ofnthe help. His little maid was proof of that, and there had beennrumours going back to Ivor's childhood about the girls in hisnfactories. Being male, no-one had thought to keep such lurid talesnfrom Ivor, and William himself a time or two when in his cups hadnalluded to more than a few trysts with willing young females. Some ofnwhom, Ivor dimly remember, still worked in the house. Still, it had made the shooting party so much more complicatednthan it needed to have been. Ivor couldn't have come up with a morenconvoluted plot for a drawing room farce had he tried. Except thosenusually ended in lavish Gypsy weddings — not murder. \"Of course, sir.\" Parks turned away, then paused.n\"Although... I'm given to understand he gave one of the visitingnmaids quite a fright.\" Ivor blanched, imagining — unfortunately all too vividly —nHenry mistaking some poor scullery maid for a woman of easy virtue.n\"I see. Was — is she all right?\" \"She's fine, sir. It went no further than a fright, that'snall.\" \"I'll have Morris speak with him.\" \"I'd appreciate that, sir.\" \"Which maid?\" Ivor asked as he searched his memory,ntrying to conjure an image of Henry's unusual favourite type andnmatching it against the faces he'd seen in the corridors sincenarriving Saturday. \"Lady Trentham's, sir.\" Ivor knew he should not have been shocked, but he'd had a fleetingnglimpse of the girl when they'd found Lady Trentham's car stopped bynthe side of the road. She'd been half-drowned, and looked perhaps allnof fifteen years old, though he knew she must have been at the verynleast old to have left home and taken a job in London. Hardly Henry'snusual quarry, to be sure. Ivor pitied the poor girl. Lady Trenthamnhad spent most of tea in the drawing room listing the girl's manyndeficiencies, and painting herself as quite the saint for taking hernon and training her up to be a useful member of society out of thengoodness of her heart, rather than the meanness of her purse. \"What on earth was Henry thinking?\" Ivor closed hisneyes, as if in pain. \"He wasn't thinking, of course. He neverndoes.\" Ivor had met Henry at a party in Los Angeles. He'd absolutely loathed his months in Los Angeles, where no-one seemed to takenhim seriously as an actor. Even his talents as a writer were wastednas he watched play after play of his re-written until completelynunrecognisable by the gum-chewing children that seemed to populatenthe Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer offices. His last effort had been a polish onnCyril Humne's Tarzan script, starring a beautiful youngnOlympic swimmer. He'd spent most of his time with Douglas Fairbanksnand Joan Crawford, who had given him his true entrée into Hollywoodnsociety. Henry Denton was a contract player at Fox Studios, who had workednon dozens of pictures that year, but never in a speaking role. Henrynhad let it drop to anyone who would listen that he had been picked upnby Friedrich Murnau, who had been his lover. As Murnau had just diedn— killed in a terrible auto accident with his valet, a beautifulnFilipino — there was no-one there to nay-say him. It was just thenfirst of a long string of prominent men with forbidden romanticnpursuits Henry claimed to have satisfied during his brief time innMovietone City. But Ivor had allowed himself to be charmed by thenalmost unworldiness of Henry's beauty. The young man unfortunatelynknew exactly how attractive he was to both sexes, and Ivornsoon tired of his narcissism. In truth, Ivor was simply used to being the clever, charming one.nHenry didn't seem to understand his place — and so Ivor had gentlynousted him from his orbit. Still, Henry was a fixture at a certainntype of Hollywood party, and it was no real surprise when henappeared, affixed to Morris like a barnacle to a whale. \"Well, he'll be gone in a week. Back to Hollywood, withnMorris.\" \"Will you be going overseas as well, sir?\" \"Oh no. No, I've served my time in that particularninstitution. I much prefer the theatre, truth be told. There's justnsomething about performing to a live audience — that electricitynthat you can't capture posing for a camera, no matter how good thendirector. Do you ever go to the theatre, Parks?\" \"Now and then, sir,\" Parks replied. \"I saw you,nsir, once.\" \"Really? Which play?\" \"The one where you have the dodgy Russian accent, sir.\" Ivor laughed. He tried to picture Parks in the pit at the Princenof Wales, towering above the other denizens. The mental image simplynrefused to form. A bare-knuckled boxing match in the street,ncertainly. Among the perfumed masses at an opening night? It wasn'tnthat he found Parks at all coarse, despite the London accent that wasnmore barrow-boy than Eaton school tie. But there was something aboutnParks that put Ivor in the mind of a completely different milieu. \"Did you like it?\" \"It was alright, sir. I thought you were quite good in it.\" \"I wrote that, you know. They've asked to turn it into anfilm. I think Maurice will let me keep Ursula, at least. I'll try andndo better with the accent. For your sake.\" \"Don't go to any trouble on my account, sir,\" Parksnsaid, the corner of his mouth twitching upwards in a faint smile. In that moment, regardless of whatever class barriers might existnbetween them, Ivor decided he liked Parks immensely. \"I suppose I shall have poor Mabel Nesbitt hanging all overnme again this evening. We're quite the exclusive club, really. Thenjester, and the girl who married above her station and will benpunished for all time for it. Unless Lady Trentham finds anotherntarget, which I find doubtful. She's a shrewd one. She can't snipe atnpoor dead William for being common. Not in good taste. Mrs Nesbittnand I present far too a broad target to miss.\" \"It's only for another night or two, sir.\" \"Yes, of course. That Inspector Thompson was more interestednin telling me how he saw me perform during the war, than mynwhereabouts last night. Well, that, and asking me why I travel undernan assumed name, at the prompting of Mr Dexter.\" \"Sir?\" \"He was very curious about how exactly I was related tonWilliam, when we didn't share a surname. An old family name, Novello.nThe old family in question may have been Italian. And not necessarilynrelated to me by blood, no matter what my darling Mam might claim.nIt's hard to picture Drury Lane selling out for — \" the pitchnof his voice was suddenly the musical sing-song of South Wales,n\"David Davies from Cardiff.\" Like a party trick, his voice returned to the cultured accent henaffected around William and his family and their ilk. \"Afternthat, they just wanted to know why Henry was trying to pass himselfnoff as Scottish.\" He shook his head. \"Americans reallyndon't have the slightest idea. To them, I suppose it all just soundsnquite posh. I tried to talk Henry out of the accent, but he wasnconvinced he could pull it off. Stupid . \"I wish I'd never mentioned William to Morris, now. Then nonenof us would be here. Maybe if we had... I suppose we'll never know.\"nHe sighed, leaning back on the bed as Parks knelt to lace his blacknpatent leather dress shoes. \"He was an odd mixture. Better andnworse than people imagined him. Poor William. I always thought himnthe luckiest person I knew. I wonder what his star sign was?\" \"Gemini, sir,\" Parks replied absently and withoutnhesitation, his eyes still on his work as he brushed Ivor's trousers. \"Hmmm? Now, how on earth do you know that?\" Ivornbreathed, and Parks paused then, his face betraying a hint ofnsomething Ivor couldn't quite identify as he replaced the brush onnthe side table. Parks raised his head, making eye contact with Ivor.nHis eyes were a startling shade of green beneath dark brows. Theynsimply stared at one another for the space of a few seconds, and thennthe moment was broken as Parks turned and collected Ivor's soilednclothes from the back of the chair. \"I think I'd better have these washed, sir. They still won'tnsay how long you're going to be here.\" Without a backward glance, Parks left. Ivor watched him go, thendoor clicking shut behind him. He felt, quite absurdly, as if he hadnbeen dismissed rather than the other way around. It was annextraordinary feeling, and not one Ivor much liked. He took the last cigarette from the now-empty packet of blacknTurkish cigarettes, and inhaled deeply. His chauffeur Morgan always joked that Ivor smoked in order toncollect all the Cinema Stars cards inserted in each pack — his ownncard being a jealously hoarded prize by school boys and sighingnfactory girls for the last decade. But he'd begun smoking on-stage inn\"The Rat\" and continued the habit off-stage long after thenpopular show had closed, despite the damage it did his voice. Thentruth was, Ivor liked having something to do with his hands. He likednthe very business of smoking, and watching the patterns the smokenmade as it twisted in the air. Gemini, Ivor mused as he slipped on his jacket. The twins. Thatnwas very like William, in a way. It was difficult to reconcile thengruff old man who doted on his dog and, occasionally, his daughternwith the cut-throat businessman who had kept two factories goingnthanks to an inexhaustible supply of teen-aged girls willing tonsacrifice their youth and many cases their virtue in order to fillntheir families bellies. Gemini, indeed, Ivor mused. After all, he had been murdered twice. Dinner was subdued, with the exception of Lavinia fretting overnher missing husband. Ivor kept up a stream of empty chatter withnMabel, but even she seemed to be wearying of the strain. The emptynseat at the end of the table was not unlike being visited bynWilliam's ghost. The only thing to recommend his absence was hisnlapdog that no longer begged for scraps beneath everyone's feet,nshedding on the gowns and trouser-legs. Ivor hadn't seen the littlendog since it had been shooed out of the library the night before bynSylvia. He wondered idly what had become of it. Ivor's thoughts continued to return to Parks. He'd seen the valet in passing in the corridor over the last twondays, travelling to and fro from the servants' hall and thenStockbridge's generously appointed rooms. Parks went about hisnbusiness quietly, efficiently, and in as much as Ivor could tell,nwith a pleasant demeanour. While Meredith's man could barely disguisenhis hatred for his master, Parks' face never betrayed a hint of whatnhe might actually feel, beyond mild amusement. Ivor's own room was further down the carpeted hallway, next tonRupert Standish and his school chum Jeremy Blond, and across fromnMorris. The first night in the house had been something like a Frenchnfarce, as parties tried desperately not to cross paths on theirnvarious travels; Ivor's cousin Isobel sneaking into Rupert's room —nscandalous behaviour for a girl her age, but hardly surprising givennher upbringing; Henry slinking in and out of Morris' room, and heavennonly knew where Jeremy Blond was off to at 1am. Ivor had wonderednabout Rupert and Jeremy. He knew from his own experience what lifenwas like at Oxford, though in his case it had resulted in expulsionnas he was, after all, a scholarship boy who ought to know better thannto dally with Dons in the chapel. At least, not where anyone couldncatch him. The order of precedence temporarily abandoned due to thenever-shifting number of guests to be waited on at table, Jennings hadnsat Henry between Standish and Blond, as they were all roughly thensame age. But Rupert spent the entire dinner trying to coax a smilenout of Isobel, while Blond in a stunning display of good sense,nignored all Henry's attempts at drawing him into conversation. Had henbeen born into the same class as Jeremy, Ivor had no doubt thencomplete rejection would have been benign in nature — blue bloodnseeking only to converse with its own nursery mates. However Ivor hadnit on good authority that Jeremy himself was the son of merely wellnto do bankers, whose blood was alas, as red as his own. So he assumednJeremy was simply protecting his territory by freezing out theninterloper. Whatever the reason, it appeared to be working quiteneffectively. Like one of Ivor's mother's cats when presented with a lockedndoor, Henry hated being left out and was convinced that whatever henwas being denied was clearly that which would make him happiest innthe world. But of course now that he had unfettered access to thenglittering world he had been prevented from joining while posing as anvalet, he was now wretched and miserable at being slighted. And Ivornhad no doubt Henry had already convinced himself that he would benmore comfortable downstairs with the visiting chauffeurs, valets, andnmaids. Ah, Henry. Predictable to the last , Ivor thought as Henryndrained his wine glass for the second time since he'd sat down,ndespite the fact that the wine was actually quite vile. Henry hadn't even batted an eye when Ivor broached the subject ofnhis accosting the poor maid. He was far too concerned with what to donabout Sylvia, who continued to look right through him as if he wasn'tnthere, while Morris sulked peevishly. \"I didn't mean anything by it,\" Henry had said with ancasual shrug when Ivor took him aside in the salon before dinner. Hisnattire — pure Hollywood young buck — stood out among the formalndress of the other men just as Henry stuck out like a sore thumbnamong his betters. He simply couldn't understand why the assemblednjewels of the British upper crust weren't thrilled to have a buddingnfilm star in their midst. \"Just a bit of fun.\" \"Do be more careful about your fun , will you?\"nIvor had tried to restrain his ire. Henry might be headed back to LosnAngeles on the first ship out of Southampton, but Ivor had to remainnon good terms with the McCordles, for his mother Clara's sake ifnnothing else. He would never hear the end of it from his Mam ifnSylvia barred him from all future gatherings solely due to hisntenuous relationship with Henry Denton. \"Anyway, she follows Parks around like a terrier,\" Henrynhad added, his attractive features set in a sullen scowl. Ivor raised a brow. \"Parks?\" \"Do you know they call everyone downstairs by their master'snnames? They call Parks 'Mr Stockbridge'. It's weird. He's weird.\" \"How so?\" \"Just... You can't talk to the guy. Believe me, I tried.nEverybody else sits around downstairs, gossiping. But not him. Evennin his room, all he does is smoke and read. He talks in his sleepnmore than he does when he's up and walking around.\" \"Really? Whatever does he say?\" \"Something about some woman named Jane.\" Henry hadnfrowned. \"That's not that maid's name, is it?\" The truth was, Ivor hadn't known the girl's name at all. But henbegan to understand why Parks had brought Henry's indiscretion tonIvor's attention. If Parks was fond of the girl, then he must bentrying to protect her virtue. Either in the sense of an older brothernto a young sibling or — and Ivor had to reluctantly admit this wasnmore likely scenario — because he fancied her himself. Yet he hadnnot brought it to Jennings, who would have discreetly informed Morrisnof Henry's faux pas . That is what he ought to have done, in asnmuch as Ivor understood these situations. Instead, Parks had trustednIvor with the information. Having grown up in a relatively modest Welsh household, he hadnnever quite got into the habit of viewing servants much like dumbnpieces of furniture. Ivor didn't have servants so much as a surrogatenfamily. From his secretary and right hand man, dear Lloydie, whom henhad known since childhood and could not live without, to hisnchauffeur Arthur Morgan who did double duty in small roles in hisnplays as well, Ivor saw those he employed as people first . Henhoped to God he never changed, either, as he felt he was gifted withntruly loyal friends rather than paid sycophants and lackeys. He couldn't imagine poor dear William as considering any of hisnservants — even Probert, who had been with him since he'd marriednSylvia — as friends . They were symbols of his hard-wonnstatus among the upper echelons of British society. Accoutrementsnthat came with the country house he'd purchased along with hisnbaronet, and as such, were treated as props. Embellishments toncomplete the perfect image of the baron in his country house, even ifnWilliam himself was the son of a coal miner from South Wales. Yet henmust have showed a softer human side to his servants, to have Probertnactually weeping as he had in the library. Ivor tried to picture a man like Raymond Stockbridge — who,nwhile thoroughly decent, was still only comfortable among peers —nhaving any kind of informal relationship with a man like his valet.nThey came quite literally from two different worlds. Ivor's gazednsettled speculatively on Stockbridge, who had taken what would havenbeen William's place at the head of the table, no doubt thrilled tonbe sat as geographically far from Sylvia as possible. As if he could feel Ivor's silent gaze weighing him down, Raymondnmet his eyes with almost a challenge. \"I must thank you for the loan of your valet,\" Ivor saidnwith a charming smile meant to disarm, not in the least flustered tonhave been caught staring. \"It was very much appreciated. Tellnme, has he been with you long?\" \"A few months. My man Carlisle was taken ill — influenza, Inbelieve they said. He was my batman during the war. It was quite anblow when he died of it. Losing him was like losing a good right arm.nHe even loaded for me, during shooting season.\" \"You're lucky, then, to have found so competent anreplacement.\" Raymond muttered an affirmative and returned his attention to thensoup. Louisa, however, smiled at Ivor, glad of the chance to makensome small talk. Unlike her husband, Louisa didn't seem to care whonIvor's parents were. He'd always got along well with her, and henbelieved her tears for William were real. She was mourning an ideanmore than the man himself, but she alone of the shooting party seemednto actually be upset over William's death. \"It was our butler, Brooks, who secured the interview. He hadnexcellent references.\" \"Really? What was his previous situation?\" \"With the Earl of Flintshire, I believe,\" Louisansupplied, \"wasn't it, Raymond?\" \"Never met the man, but he spoke very highly of him,\"nRaymond conceded. \"He's been absolutely marvellous, he really has,\" Louisancontinued. \"We've been up to Scotland shooting several timesnthis year, and I can't imagine how we'd have managed without him.\" \"Quite.\" And the subject quite clearly, so far as LordnStockbridge was concerned, was closed. Louisa caught Ivor's eye, asnif to say 'so sorry, darling. At least you don't have to live withnhim'. As the fish course was replaced by the soup, Ivor's eyes raked thenforms standing stock still behind the table, waiting for the nextncourse to be served. George, for example, could barely control hisncontempt for... well... everyone . The second footman Arthurnappeared to be utterly star-struck by him, and Ivor often felt hisneyes following him during dinner, and he very carefully never madeneye-contact. Jennings was just Jennings , as he had alwaysnbeen. The very model of what a servant ought to be, yet almost kindnin his gruffness. Like a father-figure of the household, sharing hisnceremonial place as pseudo-parent with Mrs Wilson. William had told him once that Wilson had been quite lovely in hernyouth. Ivor had taken him at his word. It could scarcely be believednthat those grey cheeks had ever been alive with blushes, as shenseemed more a shade than alive. In the past two days, Ivor had only seen Wilson flitting fromnplace to place, always behind the scenes, the engine driving thenday-to-day operation of the manor. Below stairs was her domainnutterly. Ivor was more accustomed to thinking of Sylvia's maid Lewisnas running the house, but that was simply an extension of Sylvia'snown belief that the sun rose and set because she commanded it. Henknew that Mrs Croft and Wilson were responsible for everything fromnthe table linen to the pot of chocolate that appeared in his roomnnightly. Yet he remembered now seeing Wilson above stairs once lastnnight, through an open door. Just after the police arrived, he'd seennjust a glimpse of the thin, stern housekeeper, and then she'd meltedninto the shadows again. Ivor almost thought he had imagined her. As dinner continued on in tense silence, Ivor realised that he hadnnever once wondered until now just how William could havenknown Mrs Wilson as a girl. He had always assumed like some ancientnpiece of inherited furniture too heavy to be moved, she had simplyncome with the house. But William had only purchased Gosford after hisnmarriage, just before Isobel was born. Ivor could not imagine MrsnWilson's girlhood to have been any more recent than at least thirtynyears ago, if not more. Ivor made his way somewhat unsteadily down the long hall from thenstaircase to his bedroom, his footsteps creaking slightly in thendarkened hall. The clock had chimed twelve some time before, and asnno-one on the coast would be up for another few hours, even Morrisnhad given up his vigil at the telephone, forsaking Winfield Sheehannfor his bed. Normally, Ivor detested drunkenness and never touched anythingnstronger than champagne. \"Marvellous stuff, champagne. Everynhome should have some,\" he'd been quoted many a time. But Sylvianhadn't uncorked the champagne tonight for obvious reasons, so Ivornhad made do with wine at dinner, somewhat unwisely followed up withnsingle malt. As a result, he would most likely have a sore head innthe morning, and found the laces of his dress shoes uncommonlyncomplicated. After pulling the bell, he laid down on the turned-down bed andnstared up at the ceiling, allowing his mind to wander. He sighed. He ought never to have come to William's shootingnparty. Pure folly, from start to finish. This was not his milieu anynmore than it was Parks', Ivor thought idly. They were both forced outnof their comfort zones. Playing roles to which, while they werenexperienced and showed a deft hand for mimicry, they were ill-suited. In any other circumstance — were Parks not in the employ of hisnlate cousin's brother-in-law, and therefore safely distanced fromnsocial obligation by the manners and customs of service and those whonserve and those who were serviced — Ivor would invite Parks tonshare a drink with him and talk plainly about their likes andndislikes. However for the time being, it was too tempting to resist pullingnthe velvet cord knowing it would summon the handsome valet to hisnbedchamber. No harm in looking, even if he did not intend to buy,nIvor thought with a lazy smile as the door opened and the object ofnhis idle daydream appeared. \"Ah, Parks, there you are. I'm having a bit of trouble withnthese shoes. You tied them very tight.\" Ivor waved at the shoes,nbut remained prone atop the counterpane. \"So sorry to call you.nI'm keeping you from your bed.\" \"It's no bother,\" Parks said, but there was a merrynlight dancing in his green eyes as he knelt and began working on thenlaces. \"Lord Stockbridge hasn't rung for me yet, so I'd havenbeen in the servants hall waiting anyway.\" The sight of him kneeling at the foot of the bed made Ivor sigh. \"I do wish Bobbie were here. Still, it's just as well henisn't. Mind you, he can't stand these people and I hardly blame him.nI'm not shocking you, am I?\" \"Sir?\" Parks deftly undid the laces of the first shoe,nthe knot not giving him any trouble. \"I've been with Bobbie since the war. As you can imagine, atntimes it can be... difficult. In certain circles. Sylvia doesn'tnmind, so long as I flirt with her in drawing rooms. William pretendsn— pretended, I should say, ignorance.\" \"I don't mind at all, sir. What's done behind closed doors isnnone of my business.\" \"That's a very enlightened attitude,\" Ivor said as henunbuttoned his shirt and tossed it over the back of the chair. \"I like girls.\" Parks shrugged. \"The way I see it,nwith fellas like you around, well... more for me, sir. Works out bestnfor everyone.\" Ivor laughed. \"Quite the evening, all around. Even Mabelnappears to have grown a back-bone. She is a dear thing. I do hope shenlands on her feet. And I suppose you've heard about Henry.\" \"Heard what, sir?\" \"I don't think Mr Denton will be quite as keen, tomorrow,\"nIvor said in a conspiratorial stage whisper. \"I'll hand it tonGeorge — he has excellent aim. Not a single drop on the carpet ornthe sofa cushions. Very good aim. We could have used him atnthe front.\" Ivor stepped out of his trousers and Parks helped him into his rednsatin dressing gown, absently brushing lint from the lapels. Ivor layndown again on top the turned-down bed, ankles crossed as Parks busiednhimself with picking up Ivor's evening dress where he had draped itnover a chair. It was almost mesmerising, watching him work. He movednat a steady pace, never pausing, his green eyes flitting around thenroom to ensure he hadn't left anything. Ivor was struck by an odd thought. Henry had come to the shootingnparty to learn how to play a servant. Parks played the part to suchnperfection, yet Ivor was sure that somehow it was play-actingnof a sort. All his actions were perfect, precise, and utterlynsubservient but the look in his dark eyes earlier, as he'd beennhelping Ivor dress, had been at once amused and almost challenging. \"I used to think crashing my plane was the most frightfulnwreck I ever walked away from, but sometimes I look at this house...nSylvia only tolerates me at these frightful gatherings to show me offnlike a string of pearls she's acquired.\" Ivor sighed. \"Thenone I feel sorriest for is poor Isobel. I don't think Sylvia knowsnquite what to do with poor Izzie. Once she left the nursery andnSylvia had to face the fact that poor Izzie was never going to be hernmother in miniature, I think she just took to ignoring her, hopingnshe would go away.\" Ivor had always been terrifically fond of children, and got onnwell with Isobel ever since he had first met her as a solemn, gawkynchild of seven at a garden party. With her frizzy dark hair whichnrefused to hold a style for more than the first few minutes after thencurling papers had been removed, and her shy smile, she had capturednIvor's heart from the moment he had laid eyes on her. William hadnwanted to ask him to be her godfather, but the Countess of Trenthamnhad put her foot down and suggested quite firmly that her sonnChristopher really ought to be the cherished heiress' guardian shouldnanything dreadful and tragic happen to Sylvia and William. Antwenty-year old cousin — no matter how much of a fortune he hadnmade off royalties from 'Keep The Home Fires Burning' — wouldnsimply never do . Ivor of course, thought of himself as a bit like Isobel's FairynGodfather, lavishing attention on her when she came out and had hernseason. He'd even invited her to a party at The Flat, but she'dnbegged off, admitting to being beyond terrified of his friends —ngranted, Noel would terrify anyone, so he could hardly blame her. Thenfeather in her cap was meeting young Rupert. Though Ivor knewnStandish would hardly be considered a good match, given his annualnincome, she'd talked of nothing else for days. He was tall,nfair-haired, infinitely polite and, as near as Ivor could tell,nclearly doted on her. The truth was, Ivor longed for children of his own. But in theirnabsence, he made do with borrowing William's. It seemed all he couldndo, sometimes. Watching her in the first blush of young love, Ivor felt like anproud parent in a way. He knew during her season there had been somensort of scandal involving Freddie Nesbitt, but as he had no valet ofnhis own to listen to the servant's hall gossip and report back, henwas left wondering how poor Izzie had become entangled in such anmess. Lavinia had told him at breakfast that Freddie had weasellednhis way into the shooting party solely on her invitation. IfnChristopher, Lord Trentham, hadn't dropped out, Freddie would neverneven have been invited. Of course, then Ivor would have been deprivednof Mabel's charming company. Then again, it might have been worth it,nto be spared the Lady Trentham's ire. \"Do you have any family, Parks?\" Ivor asked, suddenlyncurious. \"I've a half-sister, but I've never met her.\" Ivor was astounded. \"How on earth did you acquire a sibling,nyet avoid her completely?\" \"I was raised in an orphanage,\" Parks said simply. Ivornwaited for him to elaborate, but no more knowledge was forthcoming.nParks clearly held his secrets close. \"I'm so sorry. I had a sister — an adopted sister. Her namenwas Mary. She learnt German just to study piano with Leschetizky. Itnwas before the War, of course.\" \"Were you close?\" \"Not very. Before I was born my parents had a daughter, butnshe only lived for a few weeks. I suppose Miss Williams was annadequate substitute. She did play piano divinely. It always helps tonhave another performing Novello in the family.\" Ivor allowed his gaze to rest on Parks' bent head. \"Lady Stockbridge thinks quite highly of you.\" Parks remained silent and Ivor wondered if he had encroached onnsome forbidden subject. After all, Louisa had made it plane on manynan occasion that she found Raymond's snobbishness tiresome. Perhapsnshe followed in her sister's footsteps when it came to beggingnfavours of a handsome staff. \"They both do. I took the liberty of letting them know hownmuch I appreciated the loan of you this evening. I hope you don'tnmind.\" \"Inspector Thompson says we're all to be released, sir, sonI'll bring your clean things up from the laundry while you're atnbreakfast.\" \"Have they discovered who killed poor William, then, while wensupped and played cards?\" \"I believe the prevailing theory is that it was a cracksman,nsir.\" \"William wasn't poisoned by Raffles. Stabbed, maybe... Insuppose we'll never know.\" \"Raffles, sir?\" \"The gentleman thief. Have you never read the pulps?\" \"I just never pictured you for the type, sir.\" \"Oh, my life is spent travelling from one stage to the next.nThere's always some magazines that make the rounds among the chorus.nI used to be quite taken with detective stories, in my misspentnyouth. Particularly Molly of Scotland Yard. Have you ever read it?\" \"Can't say as I have, sir. I prefer the classics,\" Parksnsaid, removing a slim volume from his jacket pocket. Ivor leanednforward to read the title off the spine. The Count of MontenCristo. Just then there was a tapping at Ivor's door. \"Yes?\" Ivor said, vexed at being interrupted. An ashennArthur stood outside, nearly unable to speak for nervousness. \"I'm so sorry, Mr Novello, but Lord Stockbridge just rang fornhis man — \" \"Of course. I understand. Duty calls.\" Parks inclined his head, and set Ivor's shoes next to the chair. \"Oh, and Parks?\" \"Yes, sir?\" \"I'm given to understand from Henry that you talk in yournsleep.\" \"Really. Did I say anything interesting?\" \"Oh well, you'll have to ask Henry. I wouldn't dream of asking.\" He closed the door behind him, and Ivor Novello didn't see RobertnParks again for two years. The investigation into William's death was closed — unsolved —nwhen Inspector Thompson had been unable to locate either witnesses orncredible suspects. Sir William McCordle's funeral had been a quietnaffair attended only by close family. Ivor had sent a floralnarrangement but chose to remain at home at Redroofs. His decision notnto attend was based partly on the knowledge that Lord Stockbridge wasnaway in Scotland, and presumably his valet with him. Bobbie hadnteased him mercilessly, as only Bobbie could, but Ivor refused to benashamed that he looked forward to someday meeting Parks again on morenlevel footing. His wish was granted one warm August afternoon when a heavynenvelope arrived by post. Inside was a gilt-edged invitationnannouncing the engagement of Isobel McCordle to a Mr John Ferris,nmarriage to be celebrated at the McCordle family home at GosfordnPark. Ivor debated attending for the space of 15 seconds before henpicked up the telephone and rang Sylvia. \"Darling, I've just heard. Who is the lucky fellow?\" \"Some rich American with plenty of money of his own, thanknheavens. It's all too extraordinary. Oh, you will come, won't you?nIsobel has her heart absolutely set on you being there. With Williamngone, Raymond will be walking her down the aisle. But there's no-onenelse to represent the McCordle side of the family. No-one I'd want tonspend a week with, anyway.\" Ivor swallowed a laugh at Sylvia's almost unconscionable rudenessnas always couched in flattery. \"I'd be delighted.\" \"I tried to talk her into having it at St Margaret's, but shenabsolutely refused. I don't understand the girl. She spent more timenat St Clare's than she ever did at Gosford, yet you'd swear it wasnher ancient ancestral home from the way she carries on. It's beennshut up ever since...\" Sylvia trailed off. \"Well, one lastnhurrah, I suppose. Oh do say you'll come. Please, do. It will be evernso frightfully boring if you don't.\" \"Would it be alright if I brought someone?\" \"Just so long as she won't stand out, dearest. My AuntnConstance is coming, and you remember what a fuss she made overnFreddie Nesbitt's little wife. I didn't hear the end of it, not fornweeks. I could rather do without a fuss.\" 'Not this time' Ivor mouthed to Bobbie, who shrugged. \"Ofncourse, Duckie. I understand completely. I'll ring you next week, andnyou can tell me all the gossip.\" \"Ivor, darling, I don't know what I'd have done without you,\"nSylvia said, and then rang off. \"You don't mind spending the week-end at the Flat with justnFay and Eddie for company, do you?\" Ivor asked as he replacednthe phone in its cradle. \"It's not as if it's the first time,\" Bobbie sighed. Gosford did not seem to have changed. When Morgan pulled up, Ivornalmost expected to see William standing at the door to greet him. Hensmiled warmly at Jennings as he climbed the steps. Good old Jennings,na permanent fixture. \"I've brought my driver, Morgan. Can you have Mrs Wilson makensure he finds his way to the stable block?\" \"Mrs Wilson has left us. But I shall instruct Mrs McCallum,nI'm sure she will look after him.\" Ivor was shown to his room — the same room as last time, withnthe long pier glass in one corner, bright yellow wallpaper making itnseem cheery despite the slight Autumn chill in the air which onenalways seemed to feel in great old houses no matter how much coal wasnburning. There was something decadent about arriving in one's room to findnbags unpacked, his own shaving kit laid out neatly, and a roaringnfire in the grate. He'd left his dresser, Bill Wright, back in Londonnso he imagined Jennings had pressed one of the footmen into servicenon his behalf. He supposed it was too much to hope Parks might benassigned to him, as a lonely valet-less bachelor. But the house wasnthronged with wedding guests, all of them with their servants in tow.nStill, the hope lingered as he crossed to the window to gaze out atnthe sunset. His guest room faced the park and if he stood to one side, hencould look down at the courtyard behind the house. Lanterns hung atnthe kitchen door casting pools of light across the gravel as the skynbegan to darken to an exquisite shade of blue in the East. There was movement below and he recognised Parks' silhouette as itnseparated from the purple shadows closest to the house. As Ivornwatched unseen from above, Parks crossed the yard toward a girlnsitting on one of the benches that lined the wall, nursing a cup ofntea. Her dark hair was bobbed, and held away from her cheek withnpins. Ivor couldn't be certain, but he thought it might be LadynTrentham's little Scottish maid. The last time he'd seen her she'dnbeen helping Elsie into his car, with her precious cargo of illicitngoods — William's little dog, who had to its credit not barked oncenthe entire journey to London. Ivor wondered idly if the dog hadnfollowed Elsie to Los Angeles, where Morris had made her something ofna nine day wonder. His marvellous find from across the sea. Americansndid so love their Cinderella stories. Parks sat down next to her, his thigh close enough to her blackncrepe dress that Ivor found himself leaning forward, his breathnfogging the pane of glass. They appeared to have a pleasantndiscussion, and Robert stole a biscuit off her plate. She reached upnto ruffle his hair affectionately, and it was somehow an intimatengesture as it was witnessed solely by Ivor, who knew he should movenaway but was rooted to the spot. The girl got up to return to the servants' hall and Parks caughtnher sleeve. He swiftly scanned the yard to make sure no-one wasnwatching, a gesture Ivor was all too familiar with. As he bent hisnhead and kissed her softly, Ivor noted she still had the teacup onnits saucer balanced carefully in one hand. Ivor let the curtain twitch shut, giving them their privacy. The red salon was full of people, only some of whom Ivornrecognised. Lady Trentham was ensconced on one long sofa, her greynhair expertly waved, chatting with another matron of a similar agenthat may or may not have been a lady in waiting to the Queen. Therenwere simply scads of people milling about, but as soon as she sawnhim, Isobel ran over to give his hand a quick squeeze. \"Hallo, dearest.\" He bussed her cheek with a kiss.n\"Congratulations.\" She was still tall and thin, but seemed less coltish, as if shenhad grown into herself a bit more. She moved with a bit more grace,nand her clothes were stylish and seemed less like a costume than hernnatural attire. No longer a child, and clearly a young woman. And shenpositively glowed with happiness. \"Ivor, this is John Ferris, my fiancé,\" Isobel said,npresenting her young man. \"Charmed,\" Ivor said, shaking his hand. Ferris wasnenormous — obviously the product of a lifetime of consuming vastnquantities of American beef. He had black hair and black eyes, andnseemed utterly besotted with his English Rose wife-to-be. Only thenbarest flash of recognition passed over his bland features as Isobelnintroduced him as her cousin and a composer. Isobel had clearly gotnover her devastating crush on Rupert Standish, which was a pitynactually as Ivor thought they were well suited to one another. Sylvia swanned over, kissing him on both cheeks as he took a cupnof tea from the tray a liveried footman silently proffered. \"Ivor, darling, I'm so glad you're here.\" \"Of course. Isobel looks stunning, quite grown up.\" \"Her mother-in-law-to-be has spent a ridiculous amount ofntime with her and a veritable army of French dressmakers. Theneffect is quite astonishing to behold.\" \"And how are you, my dear?\" \"Still a bit like a fly in amber, I suppose. I know I need tonjust get on with it, but I haven't quite decided yet in whichndirection I shall get on.\" \"You've done marvellously, I'm sure. This old place seemsnjust the same. Although, Jennings tells me Mrs Wilson has gone?\" \"Oh, Wilson and Croftie both,\" Sylvia said with a slynsmile. \"I can't say I was sorry to see them go — they made menfeel quite superfluous, you know.\" \"How extraordinary. I can hardly imagine the place withoutnthem.\" \"It's poor old Probert's problem now. William left him anlittle money, and he got it into his head to open a small hotel bynthe sea-side someplace. Brighton, maybe. Or Margate. I can nevernremember. The Parks sisters turned in their notice and joined him.\" Ivor nearly spilled his tea. \"The Parks Sisters?\" Sylvia didn't seem to even notice his lapse as she took a longndrag off her cigarette, tapping the ash from the glowing tip into ancrystal ashtray. \"Didn't you know? They used to work for Williamnat his factory in Isleworth, I think it was. He made such a fuss whennwe bought this pile, insisting he simply had to have themnhere. Then once he was gone, they couldn't get out fast enough.\"nShe sighed dramatically. \"Rats from a sinking ship, if you asknme. Once Isobel is safely packed off to the Americas, I'll probablynsell this place. Let them turn it into a school, or let some wealthynAmerican take it over so he can play lord of the manor.\" \"I'm surprised you've kept it this long. It must be terriblynhard for you.\" She stared at him as if he had quite lost his wits. \"The memories,\" Ivor prompted, earning a brittle laughnfrom Sylvia. \"Oh, of course.\" She drifted off towards a gaggle ofnbridesmaids and their mothers, leaving Ivor alone with his thoughts. Ivor didn't see Parks again until the morning after the wedding. The wedding had been a splendid affair, and Isobel made anbeautiful bride. Ivor was glad that she had found happiness, andncould only pray it would be lasting. He'd already received a callnfrom Bobbie full of glad tidings, and threats of dire bodily harm ifnhe didn't come home as soon as possible. \"Vivien keeps saying 'oh, what a lovely dress!' to anyone andneveryone. I know you adore her, but really, Ivor... it's getting tonbe a bit much.\" \"This coming from a man who has told some of the samenanecdotes — down to the gestures and inflections — a dozen times,nunashamed.\" Ivor knew it was only the stress of a looming opening night, butnhe packed his cases and rang for a hallboy to take them down to thencar before going down to breakfast. Ivor gave Jennings his vales as he exited through the front door.nThen on a whim, he walked down the steps and turned, circling behindnthe stables to the kitchen courtyard. He spotted Parks leaningnagainst a wall, smoking a cigarette as Louisa and Raymond's casesnwere loaded. The car was still pulled around the rear of the house,nso the cases could be taken straight from the luggage lift out thenkitchen door, away from the sight of the guests. Ivor joined him,nlighting an Abdulla with the match Parks offered. \"Still reading the pulps, then? What was it? Sally ofnScotland Yard?\" Taking his cues from Ivor's behaviour, hendropped the 'sir'. \"Molly,\" Ivor corrected, playing his part. \"Younknow, in the last story, she was revealed to be the daughter of thenfictitious Earl of Flintshire.\" \"'Ivor Novello, the Musical Detective'. I bet that would sellna lot of copies.\" \"I have it on good authority that I am an excellentnconfectioner of airy trifles, but I simply cannot tackle reality. Asna writer of plays, that is. Perhaps I should stick to operettas thatnend with lavish weddings of beautiful people desperately in love.nThat seems to suit me better, don't you think?\" There was a companionable silence as they finished theirncigarettes, grinding the butts into the gravel. Parks leant down andnpocketed his. Ivor pulled out his cigarette case and offered himnanother. Parks smiled ruefully as he took it. \"Have you always been in service?\" Ivor asked as Parksntouched the burning match to the cigarette. \"Since I was thirteen. A lot of the boys went to war, sonthere were jobs going. When I left the orphanage, I didn't havenanywhere else to go.\" \"Not a lot of jobs going in Isleworth?\" \"Not unless I wanted to spend my life making soap.\"nParks' eyes suddenly narrowed. \"Who told you I was fromnIsleworth?\" \"It was either there, or Twickenham,\" Ivor said with ancareful shrug. \"I guessed. Did your mother—\" Ivor began,nbut Parks cut him off, blowing a cloud of cigarette smoke out throughnhis nostrils as he shook his head. \"My mother died after I was born. When I was little... Inalways said it was of a broken heart. I supposed that sounds morenromantic than 'cirrhosis of the liver'.\" \"Have you ever heard of Horace George Raynor?\" \"Not that I can recall. Should I have?\" \"You would have just been a boy, I think. He walked intonWhiteley's one day, introduced himself to the founder, WilliamnWhiteley, and killed him.' \"Blimey. Why?\" \"He believed — or at the very least, professed to believenthat he was the man's illegitimate son. He tried to take his ownnlife, afterwards.\" \"What happened to him?\" \"Oh, he was hanged.\" Parks looked Ivor straight in the eye. \"Poor bastard.\" Ivor knew he ought to be afraid. If what he suspected was true —nthat the man standing next to him had in fact either murderednWilliam, or had come to this house fully prepared to do so and wasnonly prevented from the act by being beaten to the punch — then henought to be terrified. Ivor ought to, but he wasn't. Because while The Count of MontenCristo was a revenge story, it was also just as much about a mannseeking justice. And no matter how kind William had been to Ivor overnthe years, no-one could deny that there was a certain justice in hownhe died. \"That your car?\" Parks asked as Morgan pulled up the rednRolls Royce, gravel crunching beneath its tyres. \"Morgan, you go around front. I won't be a minute.\" Morgan gave him a funny look, but used to Ivor's whims, did as henwas told. Ivor motioned for Parks to follow him. With a shrug, Parksnground the butt beneath his heel and removed his hands from hisnpockets and fell in beside him. As they rounded the corner of thenhouse, Ivor noted with a smile that Parks eyes followed LadynTrentham's maid as she hovered around her employer like a mother hen.nDespite the relatively warm morning, she wore a cloche hat and antweed jacket was slung over her arm. She was a pretty little thing.nIvor wished he could remember her name. \"Can I ask you something?\" Parks shrugged again, knowing Ivor was going to ask his questionsnanyway. \"If you only took the position as Raymond's valet to getnclose to William...\" \"Why am I still here? Maybe I've still got something to looknforward to.\" Ivor followed his gaze to where it rested on the young girl in ancloche hat, tucking a rug around Lady Trentham's knees. \"That seems like a worthy ambition.\" \"And what's your life's ambition, if you don't mind mynasking?\" \"Me? Oh, It's nothing. A trifle, really. I want to fill thenhouse at Drury Lane. After that, I can die happy.\" Parks' eyes creased at the corners as he laughed, displaying anquick flash of white — if charmingly crooked — teeth. A miracle,nconsidering that most young men of his generation was malnourishedndue to a combination of the War and the influenza epidemic thatnfollowed. Ivor held out his hand, and Parks shook it solemnly, but his greenneyes were smiling. Ivor got inside the Rolls, watching out of thenrear window of the car as Parks helped Lady Trentham's maid with herncoat. Ivor never saw Parks again.

I think my whole life I have been great at living other people's lives. I wrote Darcy's papers and she got 100s. I wrote my own and had to settle for 90s. I set Darcy up with Dex (the super hotty that I liked) because I wanted them both to be happy. No, not once did I think of my happiness. Some call it selflessness…I call it a curse. Welcome to my silly, tragic, and impetuously stressful life. These thoughts had kept me up until 2:34 in the morning pondering why I was always a backup singer rather than getting the solo, and why I was always just the backup plan. It tore me up internally, but no one was there to care. I mean yea Darcy is my bfflael (aka best friend for life and even longer) and she has been there every time for me, but at the same time Darcy is the one who is robbing the spotlight from me. Then there is Ethan, the best friend who has always been there but too brutally honest to appreciate. (The phone rings and startles Rachel from her divergent thoughts) \"Who the heck is calling me at 3:42 in the morning?\" \"Rach\" the voice on the phone squealed, \"What are you doing up so late don't you have to be at work in like an hour\" By this time I had figured out the voice on the phone was Darcy and sadly she was correct. I glanced down at my phone to see 5 missed calls from her. \"I just wanted to tell you that…. I'm getting married!\" Darcy exclaimed. \"R- really?\" I questioned. \"Yes, really! Aren't you excited for me and Dex?\" Darcy asked. \"Dex and I Darc… And yes, of course… it just came as a shock that's all…\" I replied. I was really thinking more along the lines as: how could I be excited your fiancé is the guy I have liked forever? \"Well listen Darc… I got to go,\" I said trying to push her off. I didn't really have to go if I was late for work what was the worst that would happen they fire me? That would actually make me happier I think. I just didn't know anymore, and that seemed to be the big problem. I just couldn't tell you how I felt, because I would cry when I thought I was happy, and laugh when I am supposed to be angry my emotions seem to be as bewildered as me. And what probably sucks ten times more is I don't know if I can ever be happy for my best friend's happily ever after. *Phone rings again* \"Hello,\" I said as I answered the phone praying to God it wasn't Darcy again. \"Rach, don't worry about making any pit stops today I got your coffee, your bosses coffee, so now all you got to do is get your skinny ass in some clothes and then hustle to get to work on time. If I can make a suggestion being late 3 days in a row with only a month of experience under your belt not your smartest move, so why don't you hurry. \" Ethan said all in what seemed like one breath. \"Thanks so much Ethan, you're the best,\" I replied hanging up the phone. I have no idea why, but the only word that stuck in that whole entire mouthful was hurry. Hurry. Oh the thoughts did hurry after that. I lifted a pencil skirt, \"Oh this is the skirt I wore when Dex invited me to a fancy, celebratory dinner.\" Gosh get out of my head Dex you're marrying my friend, and all I can do is think about you. I continued getting dressed hastily grabbing a yellow tank top with flower embroidery. \"Oh and this shirt I wore when I went down the shore with Dex.\" GAHHH! Why? I quickly grabbed two shoes and my leather purse and was out the door. Did I mention I forgot to comb my hair that was still in the messy bun it was in last night? I just felt so beautiful once I made the realization as I was in bumper to bumper traffic. Then I looked down… Why did I have to look down? There I saw none other than my car running on no gas. \"Great, just great. So now I am not only going to be 5 minutes late but at least 20. When I was talking before about losing my job being good I was only kidding God. I need my job to keep food in my stomach, and some sort of roof over my head,\" I said aloud. The surrounding people probably thought I was insane talking to myself. So what happens next? Does Rachel get to work on time? What about infamous Dex who refuses to get out of her head? And does everyone around her really think she is going insane? Hey, maybe she is.[Chapter 2] Something Borrowed (Ethans P.O.V) Pain without love pain can't get enough pain I like it rough because I rather feel pain then nothing at all. Wow I really got to stop falling asleep with my ipod on. I rolled over and a sharp pain shot up my legs. \"When was the last time I stretched?\" I shuffled over to my blackberry which read 2:00. No, not in the afternoon I could only be so lucky… but rather in the dead morning before the sun even makes its appearance. I grabbed a towel and continued to the bathroom. Shower time. In other words time for me to become a broadway star, relax, and get clean all in about an hour. \"I don't want to hear you say I want it that way… oh aint nothing but a heartache aint nothing but a mistake... I never want to hear you say I want it that way,\" I sung on the top of my lungs. After the shower I ran out the door. Not too long after I arrived at the law firm, and not to my surprise Rachel wasn't early like I asked her to be. Rachel was solemnly early. Actually, ever since I was three I don't remember a day Rachel was early. She wasn't even born early. She was born 6 days after the expected due date. She called it \"Fashionably Late\", but in law there was no room for error especially any room for lateness. So I called her. What other options did I have? \"Hello,\" she said. She sounded a little shaken up on the phone, but I had to cut right to the chase. \"Rach, don't worry about making any pit stops today I got your coffee, your bosses coffee, so now all you got to do is get your skinny ass in some clothes and then hustle to get to work on time. If I can make a suggestion being late 3 days in a row with only a month of experience under your belt not your smartest move, so why don't you hurry,\" I replied. \"Thanks Ethan you're the best,\" She responded. Wow, I really loved her calling me the best. I mean I know she didn't mean it, but it was always great to hear. Actually, her voice was always just great to hear. Whether it is 3 in the morning or 5 in the afternoon I just love to hear her talk. I started driving to Starbucks to get her some coffee she insisted she needed to wake up. Secretly, I always got her the decaf because I didn't want her to have a heart attack, and that just might sound absurd, and over cautious, but I could just never imagine my life without her. It would be unbearable. Well, she never could taste the difference or was just too polite to say anything. Boy was she polite, she was disciplined and well mannered and completely selfless. I remember as a kid… *Has a flashback* Darcy, Rachel, himself, Jordan, Joey, Ryan, and Justin were playing kickball. Rachel pitched the ball slow and steady. Jordan was up and kicked the ball off the side of his foot. The ball went flying into the street. Darcy ran after it. Rachel did too. Darcy ran in the middle of the street. A red beat up van drove speeding at her. Rachel ran into the street pushing Darcy out of the way. She wasn't as lucky as Darcy to walk away with just a scrape. The car hit her dead on, and she broke two ribs, and her arm. I remember she was too disciplined to cry. You could see the tears dwell up in her eyes but then vanish before they could fall. She was strong, and I always admired that. *Flashback ends* *Phone starts to ring* What's going to happen next? Who is on the phone? What else of the past is going to be revealed? Will he ever get the coffee?[Chapter 3] Ethans P.O.V *Phone rings* \"Hello,\" I answered hoping the cop not too far from my car wouldn't notice I was on the phone and driving. \"Hey, Ethan have I told you lately you are the best?\" It was Rachel. And there she went on telling me I was the best again. I knew this would soon be followed by some request or venting, but I was okay with that because she called me the best. \"I just got my car over to the shoulder all the gas my car was able to extract, and now I am stranded,\" She added. \"I'll be right there,\" I didn't really know where there was but I was going to get there because Rachel was there and I had to be there for her forever and always. I immediately picked up the pace to be her knight in shining armor. I wanted her to realize no matter what she asked of me I could always handle it, and most of all I wanted her to realize the only reason I can handle it is because I loved her. When I arrived to \"there\" it was 6 miles away from work. She was going to be dead this time I thought to myself as I swooped her out of her car into mine. Actually, she walked out of her car into mine, but it sounds more heroic the other way! We speeded on my stallion or mustang if you would prefer all 6 miles to work. 9 minutes flat! We did those 6 miles in 9 minutes flat! I mean I could have killed us both, but I didn't care. Rachel didn't talk the whole way there. I figured she was probably just a little shaken up, and that was why. Well, I hoped that was why because I could not bear to think that something was bothering her. Or worse…. Someone was bothering her. I would have their head! The silence was interrupted when she responded with a \"thanks .\" Just thanks nothing less.. nothing more. Something as simple as that broke my heart. You could hear the sorrow in her voice. I lowered the music, and asked her if she was okay. She replied, \"I am fine.\" And just as I was about to speak we arrived. She swung open her door flung off her heels and ran. She ran. Ran from I didn't even know. Maybe it was family problems her grandpa again I thought. But I don't think it was that. Maybe it was some boy… if it was they would have to be blind to not see what I do. If they saw what I did they would know to treat her like a princess. They would know this. I know this. Why couldn't I have a chance? Suddenly, more and more of these thoughts flood my head. I didn't even know if it was a guy yet, but I knew one thing work was not going to make anything better… she hated that place!

She walked into her parent's house and decided to talk it out with her mother about the new baby and what she needed to do. She did not want to divorce him but things needed to change. \"Mom, I know that things need to change between my husband and myself for both of our kids.\" Catherine said to her mother. She so badly wanted her advice on what she needed to do. She figured that she needs to either end it or work it out. She finished talking to her mother and then headed home. Caleb hired a babysitter to take care of their daughter until she got off. She thanked the babysitter for watching her. Emma sat down the couch and saw her mother sitting down. \"Mommy when is daddy going to be home?\" Emma asked her mother as she sat down with her to read a book. \"I miss him.\" \"I know you do baby.

The week had started off as a tragic one. It all started when Catherine and Caleb found out the depressing news. They had been wishing for a baby but Catherine was not capable of having a child. After, finding out this depressing news, Caleb and Catherine decided to adopt a child. \"I can remember it just as if it were yesterday. I could have sworn it was the end!\" stated Caleb. \"Yeah me too.\" replied Catherine. Caleb and Catherine had been searching for an orphanage in which they could adopt their first child. After days of search, they finally found an orphanage in West Virginia. At this orphanage, they found a two year old beach blonde, blue eyed little angle named Hailey Finnegan. They both fell instantly in love with her and decided she was the one. Once meeting Hailey, there was no need to continue the search of a child. \"I do recall it was around three o'clock sharp when I arrived home from the fire department when I got the call, which changed our lives.\" Caleb said. It was a casual day, in the Holt household. Caleb and Catherine were both at work at their jobs. While they were working hard, the house was silent except for the phones that keep ringing off the hook. Once Caleb arrived home he noticed the voice mail was full. \"Hmm… Wonder who has called?\" Caleb questioned himself. None of the voice mails had caught his attention except one from the West Virginia Orphanage Association. They had called wanting to notify Mr. and Mrs. Holt Hailey was ready to be picked up. \"I can not wait to tell Catherine, that Hailey is ready to be picked up! I have not been this excited in a long time!\" thought Caleb. Sure enough, Catherine stepped through the door. Caleb rushed to meet her at the door. He greeted her with a nice gentle kiss on her medium toned, soft, perfect shaped check bone. Catherine immediately replied with \"Woah! What are you so excited about?\" \"I have some exciting news!' Caleb shouted. \"What's the great news? Please tell!\" Catherine spoke in an eagerly tone. \"Okay! Okay… Once I arrived home from work, I noticed the voice mail was full. Just as I was about to turn it off, because it had been previously all junk mail…..\" \"Go on.\" \"I noticed the West Virginia Orphanage Association had called trying to notify us that Hailey could be picked up!\" \"Really! I can not wait to hold her in my arms and call her my own daughter!\" \"Yes, really. The say we can pick her up tomorrow morning in the airport.\" \"Great, I can take off work tomorrow to go with you to pick her up!\" As night fell and morning began to set, Catherine and Caleb waited anxiously for the time to come. They loaded up and headed for the airport. \"Oh… I can not wait!\" Catherine stated. Once they arrived at the airport and picked Hailey up they headed home to settle her in. As the week continued to go on, they started noticing some troubles. These troubles weren't any ordinary troubles. They were cooperation and marriage troubles. As they noticed, things weren't getting any better throughout the week. Catherine filed for a divorce. \"How? What? Please, Catherine I can change! Please, give me another chance!\" cried Caleb. \"No, Caleb it's the only choice for us. You never have time to help and care for Hailey or around the house. We are constantly fighting. It's useless!\" Catherine sobbed. Caleb was determined he would not let his high school sweetheart, wife, and best friend go. Caleb thought and thought of ways to save their marriage. His plan was to call his father. \"Dad I need your help!\" commanded Caleb over the telephone. \"Anything son, what seems to be the problem?\" Mr. Holt replied in a worried tone. \"Well… you see Catherine and I are going through the same thing that you and mother did in your younger days.\" \"Ahh... I see.\" \"Yes, so can you perhaps help me out?\" \"Absolutely, I can bring over the book that your mother and I used to help save our marriage.\" \"Thanks dad. I would appreciate it a lot!\" \"You're welcome. Now Caleb, you must remember these things take time and determination.\" Once Caleb had received the book of \"proof\", he started day by day doing each and every challenge the book gave. He was determined to win her love back. By day twenty-three out of thirty, Catherine had told Caleb about how she had been seeing a difference in his actions toward their marriage. She also told him about how he was starting to take care of all the chores that had to be done. Then Caleb apologized for all the damage he has caused and the pain he has made Catherine face. He also apologized for not being the best father and husband that he could be. Catherine and Caleb had started to talk things over and Caleb had started to finally win Catherine's heart back over. Eventually, they both came to reconciliation. They then started working together as a couple and not as individuals to help care for their precious daughter Hailey Finnegan. \"I'm so glad we could work things out!\" exclaimed Catherine. \"So am I. Like I have always told you some things come in life either they're a lesson or a blessing!\" replied Caleb. They went together to wake Hailey up from her nap to take her outside to enjoy the fresh, hot, summer heat of Georgia. \"I still can't believe we made it through this tragic week, can you?\" stated Caleb. \"Me either but we did. We made it and now we know nothing is impossible when we unite.\" Catherine replied. \"Aye, we started from the bottom and now we're here!\" Caleb recalled. ocument here...

The wall was splashed with a dancing rainbow of colour. The windowsill was the source of a heavy, but sweet smell. The shine of the floor was no match for the sparkles emitted from various points in the room. The only sound other than the blips and beeps of towering equipment came from the iPod on the side table, but even that was turned down low. Kelsey tried to compose herself with a few deep breaths. In, out. In… and out…. She squared her shoulders – taking great care not to jar her arm on the doorway – and walked in. She was very nearly tangled in web of curly balloon ribbons at the same time that she noticed that the scent of flowers increased at every step. She used her one good arm to lift a stuffed bear out of the chair she then proceeded to occupy. The late morning sun gleamed on cellophane and bright foil wrappers almost to the point of blinding her. Only one thing in the room was unaffected by its surroundings. Bethany. Kelsey stared at her friend's slumbering face. Or rather, toward : her vision was too blurred to really look at Bethany. In. Out. In. Out. She forced the tears back. Bethany's face wasn't exactly peaceful – at least, not what Kelsey would consider blissfully peaceful. She knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that at least half of Bethany's sleep was drug-induced. Since she refused to let her emotions come out through her eyes, Kelsey opened her mouth and allowed a long, shaky sigh out. Sitting here at her friend's bedside, she wondered at how she'd complained about her own pains. Little things, relatively speaking. And if she hurt, well, she couldn't imagine what it was like for Bethany. After all, Bethany had borne the brunt of it. And worse, she'd been conscious for the whole thing. Kelsey knew she had reasons to be thankful. Thankful that her own injuries weren't as awful as they could have been. Thankful that she'd blacked out early on – she rubbed the bruise on her neck ruefully. Thankful that she hadn't been awake when they almost hadn't been rescued. Seriously, even thankful to be alive considering they – she and Bethany both – had nearly shaken hands with death. Twice. Within about fifteen minutes or something like that. Trembling, she reached her cast-encased arm over the railing and took Bethany's hand. Funny, she'd come to comfort her friend, but instead found that she needed that healing touch. Two times. She'd almost died two times . Kelsey studied her friend's hot pink nails, the result of her last visit a couple days ago. The day before the operation. The day she was aware of Bethany's third look at death. Okay, so the third time wasn't anywhere near as drastic as the first two, but gangrene had set into one of Bethany's legs and…. Kelsey was no doctor, but she knew enough about infections to know that they were anything but pretty. How either of them were still alive to tell about it was beyond her. Luck. A destiny yet to fulfill. Maybe Fate took a day off – or what this Fate's doing? Perhaps the planets had been aligned just right. Or maybe, just maybe…. A part of her noted that the iPod had shuffled to another song – something about Somebody being \"already there\" and \"waiting on the other side\" or whatever. Could God have had something to do with it? Kelsey hadn't really bothered to think about God before the accident – after all, He didn't seem to show any particular interest in her problems. But then, she'd never really bothered to think about death beforehand either. And after two close encounters, she had more questions then she cared to count. That God would pay any attention to her was a weird, almost mystical idea. He certainly hadn't till – possibly – now. Though Bethany never shoved her religion at anybody – one of the reasons Kelsey liked hanging out with her –, Kelsey was sure that her friend would say that God was protecting them or had a plan for them or something. Yeah, right. If God was protecting them, He would have prevented Bethany from racing or He at least would have magically kept the collision from happening. Instead, He'd let them roll to a stop where they had; thank goodness for the firefighters who'd dragged them off the train tracks! And if He had a so-called \"plan\", what about the stump that now represented Bethany's left leg? Or for that matter, the crash? The fight drained out in a sigh as she gently squeezed Bethany's fingers and stared at the empty portion of the sheets. She knew they should have died that day. Maybe it would have even been a good thing if they had – or at least if she had, anyway. Life as she knew it was bad enough. Bethany was a good person; she didn't even deserve to be as hurt as she had been. But Kelsey? The broken arm wasn't enough. And yet, Bethany was the one most affected. Life wasn't fair. She subconsciously perked up as the iPod switched to a song that more or less resonated with her. Maybe it was because the people in the song were just so broken and lost. Maybe it was because the last verse returned those people to hope – dare she even say a happy ending? Kelsey wondered if God – if He did exist – was interested in deals. Maybe she'd at least consider His existence if she went home and found that her parents had reached some sort of resolution. Maybe she'd look into it if Bethany's leg grew back or something. Maybe she'd even believe if He sent some sort of spectacular sign, like He supposedly did in the Bible. A burning bush that talked or a massive storm out of nowhere or a hand writing on the wall. The thought of a disembodied hand creeped her out and she decided to scratch that off the list of options. She vented out a growl of frustration. Quietly, of course, so as not to awaken Bethany. She knew, deep down in her heart of hearts, that she wouldn't really believe any sign she asked for. Everything could be explained by science. Everything. Except her narrow escapes. Could it be that those themselves were the spectacular signs she was looking for? She scoffed it off, but still she wondered. Would it give her peace to acknowledge that her survival was a miracle? That God might have been watching over them after all? She ached for rest from all her questions. The burn of longing for Bethany's state of calm over the outcome begged to be eased. Uncertainty throbbed cruelly and she just wished it would end. Looking at her friend's face again, a simple gold cross pendant sparkled in the sunlight and caught her eye. The song neared its conclusion and Kelsey suddenly found herself singing along with the last line: \"Lord above, I need a miracle.\" Author's Note: The first song referenced was Casting Crowns' \"Already There\" and the second was Third Day's \"I Need a Miracle\". The latter inspired this piece. Please review!

Yes and no. No two words had ever changed his life more than those. And man, did they ever pack a punch! He'd fairly forgotten their impact. Or rather, he'd tried his hardest to forget. He could forget his string of \"yes'\" with the ladies over the past couple years. He could forget the \"no's\" he'd given another in that same time. He could even ignore his recent \"yes'\" to the beauty that was Catherine Holt. \"Dr. Keller to the burn ward please. Dr. Keller to the burn ward.\" Gavin looked up from his planner as his ears picked up the public announcement. The burn ward? Must be a new patient. He quickly scribbled \"lunch w/ Catherine 12:30\" on Friday's timeline before clapping it shut and scooping up his clipboard. He flipped through his papers as he walked down the hall, weaving around doctors, nurses, and visitors. He slapped the button to open the handicap doors to the burn ward. His sights immediately locked on two clear blue eyes set in a soot-smudged face. Nurse Candace was in the process of removing the patient's collared shirt, where the singed badge declared him a firefighter. \"I'm Dr. Keller,\" Gavin informed his new charge. \"Caleb Holt,\" the firefighter answered in a voice still clogged with smoke. Gavin offered a smile and proceeded with the examination. The patient looked worse than he really was: just a few first-degree burns, the largest of which was on his upper left arm. Judging from Caleb's brief description of events, Gavin figured he was lucky to have gotten out of the house without more significant burns at the very least. He passed Caleb to Candace's capable hands while he reviewed the x-rays and set about filling a subscription for pain medication and a report form. Candace was summarizing the x-ray results and bandaging Caleb's arm when the approaching click of heels caught Gavin's attention. \"You look terrible.\" Catherine? What's she…? He watched from the corner of his eye as Caleb's flickered with mild surprise. \"I feel terrible,\" was his reply. Gavin had to wonder how they knew each other. Friends? Relatives? He noticed that Catherine seemed uncharacteristically unsure of herself. \"You gonna be okay?\" \"Well,\" Candace offered, \"he's sustained some first-degree burns here, but he should be fine.\" Okay, so she at least had guessed a connection. Maybe his hunch was – \"So this is your husband?\" Gavin turned to Catherine. Husband? Catherine spared him a glance, then looked at Caleb, then down to the floor with a light flip of her hair. He knew body language when he saw it. She was definitely uncomfortable. \"Yes.\" Her answer hit him hard in the gut and he felt the air rush out of his lungs. Married? Catherine married? His eyes darted to Caleb with a sudden rush of panic. Does he know? \"Looks like you've got a hero on your hands,\" Candace said in an appreciative, almost congratulatory tone. He dropped his eyes and attempted to focus on the record form. A marked line awaited his signature, but he couldn't seem to remember how to sign it. Candace went on. \"Sir, I'm gonna need you to keep this arm elevated for the next twenty-four hours to help the swelling go down; and then I need you to come back in forty-eight hours to get it checked out again.\" \"Well, let me get outta your way.\" Whatever Catherine was doing to try to sound normal wasn't quite working. He could tell just by hearing her. \"Oh, no, you're not in our way; you can stay,\" Candace assured her. \"No, it's okay,\" Catherine answered. \"I'll, uh… I'll let you do your job.\" And away she went with the decided clicking of her heels. Gavin didn't know whether or not he should be relieved. There was a brief pause before Candace spoke again. \"Sir, I'm gonna get you some more gauze to take home with you and fill that prescription for your pain, okay?\" Great. Gavin desperately wanted to think of something, anything, to keep Candace around a little longer. Anything to avoid being alone with… Catherine's husband. He felt his throat tighten as he studied Caleb's blackened face. Caleb paid him no heed. Just checked the gauze on his arm. And then reached for something on the rolling tray. Gavin forced himself to speak. \"I… wouldn't put that ring back on your finger until your hand has a chance to heal.\" It wasn't a lie. Caleb's hand did have some minor burns. The ring – any ring, for that matter – would be a bad idea. He knew. He was the doctor, after all. But Caleb just turned those blue eyes of his on him and answered, \"My hand's gonna have to heal with this ring on my finger.\" And with that, he slipped it on, where it glowed bright against the sooty black of his hand. It seemed to glare at Gavin, to burn him. He unconsciously scratched his own finger and made some more markings on the report in his lap. Candace returned with the gauze and medication and Gavin stiffly repeated the instructions she'd given Caleb earlier. Then the firefighter was gone. Gavin stared at the tray, at the very spot the ring had occupied. Why? Why was she still with a man if she no longer loved him? Why had she allowed him to begin to dream again? He'd thought it was going well between them. And then this had happened. Why had she dashed those hopes she'd helped cultivate with that fateful word? Deep down, he knew at least some of the answers, but refused to acknowledge them. Numbly, he made his afternoon rounds with the image of the ring on Caleb's finger branded in his mind, burning into his heart. Doubts thundered around the image, but its fire only blazed brighter. When he finally returned to his office, he flattened the papers on his clipboard and the fireman's name glared up at him yet again. He forced his eyes away and onto a purple sticky note on his planner. \"I tried to catch you before I clocked out, but I just wanted to let you know that, yes, I'm still up for lunch on Friday. Catherine\" For the first time in hours, Gavin smiled. Really, actually smiled. \"Yes\". She still said \"yes\" to him. And who was he to say \"no\"? .*.*.*. Gavin struggled to concentrate on the papers in front of him. He could barely stop thinking about Catherine. If he let himself, his mind would wander to their upcoming lunch date, to her smile, to her sweet beauty. It was as though the episode with the firefighter had never happened. Someone entered his office unbidden. His head still bent down, he turned his eyes up. His heart skipped a beat. A fireman. The fireman. Whatever this was about, it could not be good. \"Dr. Keller?\" \"Yes?\" \"Caleb Holt.\" He swallowed. He'd tried so hard to forget that name. He didn't want it ringing in his ears again. And judging by the tone of his voice, this was going to be a conversation Gavin already wished never happened. \"I need a word with you please.\" \"Look, it's… really not a good time,\" Gavin said. \"I'm just about to make my rounds.\" \"I think you need to make time.\" With that tone of voice, apparently he did. Not that he'd relish it. His palms were already sweaty. \"This is concerning Catherine. My wife .\" No, he was not going to enjoy this in the least. He fidgeted in his chair and dared look into the firefighter's eyes. So clear, so blue. And as grave as death itself. He took a shaky breath. \"Alright. What can I do for you?\" Caleb pointed a finger at him and his voice rippled with tension. \"I know what you're doin'. And I have no intention of stepping aside while you try to steal my wife's heart.\" Gavin couldn't bear those eyes. He looked toward the door, hoping a nurse or somebody would come in with some emergency. He returned his gaze back to Caleb. \"I've made some mistakes, but I still love her. So just know that I'm goin' after her too.\" Gavin squirmed. \"And since I'm married to her, I'd say I've got a head start.\" Caleb leaned down and balled his left hand into a fist. Gavin backed away, his heart beating in trepidation. \"And by the way, thanks for helpin' me with my hand.\" The office lights set the band of gold ablaze with the unquenchable fire of the man wearing it. Gavin tried to suck in more air as the fist tightened. \"My ring finger's feelin' a whole lot better.\" Gavin couldn't stand the power in Caleb's eyes anymore. He glanced at the ring – how it mocked his pain! – and then down at his desk. Caleb walked out of the office, but Gavin felt his eyes bore into his head the whole way out. But at last, he was gone. Gavin gasped little pants of breath and suddenly pulled his desk drawer open. He had to. He knew it. His left hand dropped the pen and prepared itself. Halfway on. Halfway there. But he didn't really mean it. He couldn't mean it. There was no way he could remind himself of that life-changing time he'd said \"yes\". Besides, how would he explain this to Catherine? The gold glinted coldly at him as it scorched his finger. No. It had to go back into the drawer. He glanced at his office door as though he half-expected someone to have seen that. No, he couldn't. He wouldn't. He filed away his papers and picked up his clipboard for his morning rounds. No sooner had he exited his office then the familiar click of heels greeted him. No, not now …. \"Hey!\" Catherine greeted brightly. \"Uh, hey, Catherine,\" he returned lamely. \"How's the good doctor today?\" He refused to look at her. At the smile he knew was there. At the sparkle in her eyes. Like the diamond that, technically, should be adorning her hand. He shook his head clear of the thought. It was far too soon to have forgotten that flaming band knuckled up in his face. \"Uh… pretty busy, actually.\" \"Are we still on for lunch?\" The hope in her voice made him want to forget. Forget the ring in his drawer. Forget the ring on the firefighter's hand. \"You know,\" he started, his mind racing for words, \"I feel like there are a few things I need to catch up on. I've… gotten a little behind lately.\" At least he didn't have to worry about lying to her. About his schedule, anyway. \"Okay, um, maybe we can talk later.\" \"That'd be good.\" Oh, how nice it'd be! But no. For his own health and wellbeing, it'd probably be best if one of them simply fell off the face of the earth. He started to baby-step away. \"Alright. See ya around.\" \"See ya.\" He escaped into a patient's room. For once, he'd said \"no\". He wasn't entirely sure how he felt about that. But then a flash of gold reminded him why he had to, for who was he to say \"yes\"? .*.*.*. \"We are here to celebrate the reaffirmation of vows, establishing them as a covenant, and not a contract….\" She was every bit as beautiful as he remembered. Outwardly and inwardly. Even more so now than ever before. \"Marriage is a sacred institution established by God and designed to last for life.\" He was in this now. And he was in to stay. He couldn't remember wanting anything more. This was real. This was going to last. He took her by the hands. He'd forgotten how gentle they were and yet how strongly they could grip. He could feel them tremble a little – or was that from his own hands? She increased the pressure on his fingers and smiled. There was once a time he thought he might never see that smile again, but the past couple months had been encompassed by them. He fixed his eyes on their interlocked hands. On the bright gold that flashed in the light. A couple years ago, he would have said that this relationship wasn't worth the battle. Thank God for having sparked the fire again. \"Gavin, in the presence of God and these witnesses, do you commit to this covenant marriage to Nina?\" This was it. This was the moment their future hinged on. The moment he finally said, \"Yes, I do.\" After all, who was he to say \"no\"? \"Love is not a fight, but it's something worth fighting for.\" ~ Warren Barfield Author's notes: Things happen when the right title idea comes into your head and a character demands that you actually write the story. I never would have dreamed that Gavin would be this pushy. Also... part three was his idea entirely. It was never part of my plan, so I blame him. Please review!

It had rained during the night, and now the entire world seemed to be cleaner and fresher, as if everything were somehow more alive. Maybe it was because he felt more alive. It was strange how much everything had changed once he'd given his life to God. He stuck his hands in his pockets as he walked down the well-worn dirt road, The Love Dare tucked under his arm. The road down to the old camp had recently become one of his favorite places to walk or jog. He would often go down there to read his Bible, pray, or just get alone and think. \"Meditate on God and His Word,\" as his dad would say. There was a lot to learn still, but he was trying, and God was teaching him. The sun warmed his skin as he stopped and stood in front of the plain wooden cross. It was so simple looking, but at the same time it symbolized so very much. Taking a seat on one of the stumps in the clearing, Caleb pulled out The Love Dare and flipped through its pages. He had several days left, and while things still weren't easy, he was amazed at how much his attitude toward the entire process had changed. Absentmindedly he began to look back over some of the first few days. He thought back about how he'd done everything he could to get through them with as little cost to himself as possible, as if showing love for his wife was a tedious duty, rather than a privilege. Still leafing through the beginning pages, he began to go more slowly, reading through several of the days again. He looked back to remind himself of each dare and took the time to read the Bible verses, most of which he'd skipped the first time. Day 14 – Love takes delight. Day 15 – Love is honorable. Day 16. Caleb froze as he read his father's fine print at the top of the page. Day 16 – Love Intercedes. The day about praying for your spouse. \" I kind of skipped that one.\" Caleb's words to Michael echoed loudly in his mind. He hadn't only \"kind of\" skipped it. The first time he read it he'd only gotten about halfway through before putting the book down in disgust. He shook his head as he remembered the horrible attitude he'd had. . . . Caleb took a long drink from his water bottle and plopped down on the couch, scooping The Love Dare up from off the coffee table. He sighed as he flipped it open to his marker. Day 16: \"Love Intercedes,\" whatever that meant. Setting the book down, he got up and walked over to the fridge to find a snack. A sticky note on the fridge door caught his eye. At the top it said \"Caleb, could you get these.\" It wasn't really a question, more like a demand. Under it was a long grocery list. \"No way,\" Caleb groaned. Catherine had just been to the store. Why couldn't she get them? Forgetting about a snack, Caleb went back into the living room and sat on the couch again, picking up the leather book lying there without really wanting to read it. The first sentence didn't help much – \"You cannot change your spouse.\" \"Thanks for the encouragement,\" he mumbled. He kept reading, ignoring the first reference to God, trying to learn something from the words on the page. Until, that is, he read – \"You will need something that is more powerful than anything else you have. And that is effective prayer.\" After that he shut the book in annoyance and left. He'd told his dad from the beginning that he wasn't interested in religion, and he certainly didn't need to talk to a God who probably didn't exist about his marriage problems or anything else. . . . How could he have been so stupid? Looking back down to the book in his hands, Caleb quickly read over Day 16 from beginning to end, soaking in every word, seeing for the first time the importance of each idea. As he read he felt amazed at the power and privilege of prayer. Setting The Love Dare down on the stump next to him, he slowly got down on his knees in the cool dirt. Prayer was still something he was getting used to. It felt weird to talk to Someone he couldn't see. But he knew now that God was there, He cared, He was listening, and He had power to do whatever He wanted. \"God,\" Caleb began softly, praying out loud. He cleared his throat. \"God, I'm sorry I ignored You for so long. I'm sorry I never understood, and never wanted to. Thank You for loving me anyways, and thank You for giving me the privilege of being able to talk to You and ask You for things. About praying for Catherine, well, more than anything she needs You. She needs to know how much You love her and she needs Your salvation. If I can do nothing else for her, help me to show her that. Please, God, save our marriage. I don't want to lose my wife, and I don't want to go against Your plans for marriage. But God, I need Your help. Help me, God.\" Looking up at the wooden cross again, Caleb sighed, and then smiled slightly. He felt peace – more peace than he'd ever felt in his life. God had given him peace and hope. There were so many things to worry about, but he felt like God had taken all those things and said \"Let Me worry about them. You just trust Me.\" Standing up and brushing the dirt off his jeans, Caleb picked up The Love Dare and opened it to Day 16 again. He glanced down the page until his eyes rested on one verse in particular – \"'The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much' (James 5:16).\" He smiled again as he closed the book and began walking back to his house. A lot was going on in his life and his marriage, but somehow he knew that God had heard his prayer, and now God was going to work. ","Summary":" Caleb took a deep breath of the crisp morning air.

There had been a time when he could have honestly said that he thought that this day would never come, that the polar opposite of this day was inevitable. He shifted nervously and bit his lip as the music began to float over the crowd that had gathered to help him and his wife celebrate this occasion. Lauren. It had been nothing short of the grace of God - a God that until recently Terrell hadn't even believed in - that his wife had even considered the idea of reconciling with him. That she was here today and doing this - the final step of the Love Dare - with him was nothing short of a miracle. Beside him, his friend and fellow firefighter, Captain Caleb Holt, laid a hand on his arm to get him to calm down. Looking over at Caleb's understanding face - and the other man really did understand - Terrell noted that Caleb looked as uncomfortable in his suit as Terrell felt in his. Oh well, it really was a small price to pay for the events of the day. After a moment filled with guests scrambling to find their seats, the music changed to an old familiar tune and people stood up, looking in the same direction that Terrell was. And then there she was, smiling as brightly at him as he was at her. In the past, they had put each other through everything in the book.

Catherine couldn't believe that her doctor had pulled her into the office to give her some news. She could not believe that she was pregnant with their first child. After everything that they have been through to be pregnant is the most exciting time. She could not wait to tell Caleb about their baby. She headed home and waited for her husband to get home. She was going to be a mom. She heard his truck pulled into the driveway. She decided that she was going to go out and greet him when he got out of the truck. He smiled when he saw her coming out to the house. It had been a busy 24 hours and couldn't wait to be with Catherine again. He accepted that a baby might not be in the picture for them and he was okay with that. He just needed her. If God decided to bless them with a child, he would love it. He opened the door and gave her a small kiss. \"Hey, babe. You are home early.\" Caleb told her as she pulled away from their kiss. \"I got some news that just couldn't wait to tell you. My boss gave me the rest of the afternoon off.\" Catherine revealed to him. She knew what would happen when she told him about the baby. \"What's going on?\" He asked her. He was concern with the news that she was going to tell him. \"The doctor got my blood work back since I haven't been feeling good lately.\" She started to say before her husband interrupted her. \"Are you okay?\" He asked her. He was concern about her health. \"I'm fine. We are just expanding our family. I am pregnant.\" She revealed to her husband. He just wanted to celebrate their pregnancy and started to lead her inside. He did not want to start it outside since of their neighbors would not understand what is going on between them. They made love what seem like hours. First doctor's appointment The night before the first doctor's appointment, Caleb had to work and said that he would meet her at the hospital right before her appointment. His friends had noticed that he was so happy now after learning the news about the baby. She was waiting about ten minutes before the appointment was schedule start when he finally got there. \"Hey, I'm here.\" Caleb told her with a small kiss right before the nurse called them back to the room. \"I'm really nervous about this. What if we lose the baby?\" Catherine responded to him. \"We need to have faith and follow God's path and lean on his understanding and not ours. This baby is a blessing in our life.\" Caleb reassured his wife as the doctor walked into the room. The doctor check her over and made sure that she was around what they thought that she was. It turned out that she was already four months pregnant. She could not believe that they were that far along and had no prenatal care to this point. \"from what you can tell, is our baby developing okay since we did not find until last week?\" Catherine asked her doctor. \"The baby is fine. I am going to get you on prenatal medication. On your next appointment, we can find out what you are having.\" the doctor revealed. The doctor left the room giving them time to talk. \"Are you nervous?\" Catherine asked her husband. \"Not that much. I am just glad that we are together and having this baby.\" Caleb revealed to her with giving her a kiss right before she got dress and headed to get the information from the nurses. Five months pregnant They were not sure if they wanted to find out if they were having a baby girl or boy until their baby shower party. They have been talking about letting their family and friends find out together with them. They both decided that it was a good idea to wait.

They had the cake decorator put the gender of the baby in the cake. She was really excited to find out if they were having. They invited their family and friends.

Since their adopted daughter had still lived in China at the time, that meant that they had nothing more to see of her than a few photos and a video, but they had looked over those few items until they knew them all by heart. Every tilting smile on her lips, every glimmer in her eyes, the way her nose crinkled a little when she laughed. In the second video that they had received of their precious child came an unexpected dose of reality. In the first few seconds of the video, before a caretaker had picked Emily up and taken her into a separate room to play, their young daughter was seen in the dormitory room where she slept. She had been sitting alone in a crib - three years old and still in a crib, thanks to overcrowding in the orphanage, the adoption coordinator had informed them - and she had been crying her pretty black eyes out. The sight had broken Catherine's heart a little. That night Catherine had prayed harder than ever with Caleb for the safe deliverance of their daughter into her arms, arms that could practically feel Emily resting in them. If she had previously had any doubts about adopting Emily, they had all evaporated with that video. Catherine loved her child, and she couldn't wait to bring her home. And it seemed like forever before she and Caleb had reached this day, the day that they brought Emily back to Albany to live with them for the rest of her childhood. But now that they had her home, things were not going how Catherine had hoped that they would. It was currently two a.m. and Emily was sitting curled up in the farthest corner of her bed with tears streaming down her face while she stared at her new parents, terrified and confused. Catherine was almost in tears herself as she sat on the floor beside Caleb, both of them at a loss of what to do when she wouldn't even let them near her. Caleb shifted, trying to get more comfortable on the floor, and Emily screamed, thinking that he was going to try and come near her. Catherine squeezed her eyes closed and decided to delve back in once again. \"Come on, sweet Emily,\" Catherine crooned desperately, beginning to crawl towards the toddler bed on her hands and knees. \"Can't you let Mommy help you tonight? Let me rock you, maybe?\" Emily opened her mouth to scream again and Catherine retreated back to Caleb. God, she prayed, Is this really what Caleb and I have waited, prayed, and worked so long for? For her to hate us? I love her, Lord, she's my daughter! Why is she fighting us so much? Caleb and I worked so hard for this, we've come so far together to get to this point; she's the piece that makes our family complete. We traveled halfway across the world to get her so that she wouldn't be alone anymore, but she just doesn't want us. Now she's more scared than she ever was back in China! I've done everything that I know to do; she won't let me even talk to her without her crying. Why can't she just see that I only want to hold her? Why can't she see how much I love her? Caleb's head fell over onto her shoulder, pulling her out of her prayer that had practically become a rant. He had fallen asleep. Catherine sighed tiredly and leaned her head back against the wall, watching Emily as she watched them. And in Emily's tearful, wary gaze, Catherine saw something that took her breath away. She saw herself. Running her fingers absently through her husband's hair, Catherine thought back to when Caleb had been doing the Love Dare, all of those years ago. Every time he had done something noticeably nice - which had literally been every day - she had ran from his actions, from the affection and devotion to her that he was obviously displaying. She remembered that in the mornings she could always hear him beginning his day with a prayer. And always, without fail, her name had been the first request off of his tongue, as well as the last before his \"amen.\" And still she had fought him, ran from him as hard and as fast as she could while he was doing everything he could to allow him to hold her again. With this realization, Catherine had begun to cry. \"Oh, Emily...\" she whispered. \"Baby, I know you're scared. I understand, sweetheart. I really do. But, you know what?\" Catherine smiled through her tears. \"Things are going to get better for you, for us. I just know it.\" Emily's eyelids began to droop, and after a minute longer, she finally gave up and fell into a deep sleep. Catherine smiled and wiped at her own tears. \"Caleb, wake up,\" she whispered in her husband's ear. \"Emily went to sleep.\" Caleb stirred, then stretched his sore muscles as he roused. \"Should we try going back to our own bed?\" Catherine nodded and Caleb stumbled to his feet then helped her to hers. \"I'll be in after a minute.\" Catherine murmured. \"Okay.\" Caleb kissed her forehead and then headed back to the comfort of their bedroom. Catherine padded in her socked feet up to her new daughter's bed and slid to her knees. She bowed her head and began to pray again, lifting her daughter up to her God. At the end of her prayer, she brushed Emily's black hair out of her eyes and gently kissed the girl's forehead. They still had so far to go, but this moment in time felt like a solid starting point in her life as a mother. \"I'll love you forever, Emily Holt.\" My third Fireproof fic!

Aka, the father of Catherine Campbell, the young woman that Caleb wanted to marry. He took a deep breath. C'mon, Caleb, just get in there and get it done and over with already! One more deep breath, and Caleb squared his shoulders, pushed out his chest, and knocked on the door to the captain's office. \"Come in!\" Captain Campbell sounded distracted though, and when Caleb opened the office door, he saw why. The captain was currently on the phone with his wife, Joy. Captain Campbell glanced at Caleb and held up a finger, indicating that the younger man should wait. Caleb nodded and looked towards the pictures on the captain's desk. Each and every one of what must have been at least a dozen pictures were of Catherine. Caleb swallowed hard and with difficulty. He leaned over one picture in particular, wanting to get a better look at what portrayed what he figured was Catherine's fifth or sixth birthday party. She was dressed as Cinderella. \"She's something, isn't she, rookie?\" The captain's voice startled Caleb and his head snapped up to look at the older man. He nodded. \"Yes, sir. Catherine is quite a woman.\" Captain Campbell got an odd look in his eyes, and Caleb realized that even all of these years later, when he looked at his daughter, Captain Campbell did not see a woman. He saw his little girl. The captain cleared his throat and shuffled some papers on his desk. \"What can I do for you, son? I thought that everybody had already gone home.\" \"Oh, they have, there's just something of a more... personal nature that I need to talk with you about.\" Captain Campbell glanced at him suspiciously. \"And what might that be?\" \"Well,\" Caleb rubbed the back of his neck. \"It's about Catherine.\" The man behind the desk nodded as Caleb shifted from one foot to the other. \"I assumed as much.\" Three impossibly long seconds ticked by on the clock hanging on the wall. \"Are you going to make me guess what you want, Caleb, because I think we both know what it is.\" Another second passed with silence before Captain Campbell leaned forward, placing his forearms on his desk. \"Here's the inconvenient thing about this situation, Caleb. I can't give you permission to marry my daughter if you don't ask for it. So... why don't you give it a try?\" Caleb felt about that tall, and he knew for a fact that no fire had ever made him as red as he was at that particular moment. He cleared his throat. He finally managed to eek out, \"Can I... Do I have your blessing upon a marriage with Catherine?\" A grin split the face of Eddie Campbell as he laughed and stood from behind his desk, rounding the piece of furniture to slap Caleb on the shoulder. Caleb released the huge breath that he hadn't realized that he had been holding when the captain informed him,\"You do.\" Just then the two men heard the sweet voice of a young woman calling out, \"Daddy, are you still here?\" Captain Campbell turned from Caleb to glance at the door to his office and called out, \"We're in my office, Catherine.\" \"We?\" the pretty brunette questioned, peeking around the corner. Her eyes lit up with pleasure when she saw Caleb. \"Well, hello there, stranger.\" \"Hi.\" Catherine clasped her hands together behind her back. \"And what were you two handsome, wonderful gentlemen talking about? It wasn't little old me, was it?\" \"As a matter of fact, it was.\" her father informed her. \"So you can quit trying to hide that ring that you were given last night on your date with our friend Caleb here.\" Catherine's eyes widened. \"You gave us your blessing?\" Captain Campbell smiled at his daughter and nodded. \"I did.\" Catherine screamed with joy and threw her arms around her father. As the captain held his daughter close and placed a kiss on her scalp, Caleb noted a hint of melancholy sadness in his captain's eyes. And he didn't really blame the man for giving him a hard time, because, after all, he was the one who was stealing - and keeping - Cinderella. This story is inspired by Chuck Wick's \"Stealing Cinderella\".

Laundry Days Caleb entered the house exhausted; it had been a long day at the fire station. He thanked God that he had the next twelve hours off; it would give him time to do the laundry and go shopping. He smiled to himself as he thought of his chores, even just two weeks he would have been put out at the thought of doing these for himself let alone for his wife, Catherine. Now doing anything for her, brought a smile to his face. Making her happy and surprising her made his day. He couldn't believe that just a few weeks ago even praying for her had been an alien thought; now he prayed for her all the time. He prayed that she would find it in her heart to forgive him, that he could be the love of her life again, but most of all that she would find Jesus like he had, that she would make the decision to live for Him. He knew that she still wanted to get the divorce and that she hadn't forgiven him yet but at least she wasn't talking about it anymore. That gave him hope, although he would have preferred that she sought his counsel and spoke to him but the fact that they still lived in the same house gave him hope. If she was really bitter and angry, as she had every right to be, she would have left him or better still asked him to leave, yet she hadn't. After finishing his chores, Caleb went to him room and picked up The Love Dare. He was on day 41, apparently he had successful gone through the forty days. Where had they gone? He wondered. He sat on his bed and wondering what he was supposed to do now, then he thought about it. He would continue as though he was on the dare, he had nothing to lose after all, and a lot to gain. He pulled out his Bible and read it and then got down on his knees. Today he'd cook Catherine dinner and leave it in the oven for her with a note; he'd already bought her favourite flowers and wine. He'd set it up before going out in the evening. He hoped that she would be glad that he'd taken the time but even if she wasn't he'd have tried. He would have tried and that the best that he could do after all. 00000 Catherine came home from work, tired. It hadn't been a particularly good day at work and seeing her mum in that condition hadn't made her feel any better. She would just have a bath and sleep, she was too tired to cook and she didn't want to order any take-out. She wished she was like the other normal married people. If she were she'd have found that Caleb had prepared her a meal or something but their marriage wasn't like that, although Caleb had changed of late. He probably wanted something from her but she wasn't going to give in. She was going to be strong for once in her life. She opened the door, threw her bag on the chair and hung up her coat. She was really hungry, so she'd have to cook. She went to the kitchen; there was a bottle of her favourite wine and flowers on the table. Propped up on the bottle was a note. I thought you might be too tired to cook, so I left you something in the oven. Enjoy. Catherine read it twice and then opened the oven. He had prepared her a beef casserole. She warmed it and sat down to eat. Caleb was definitely up to something but it was good of him to cook for her. She didn't know what made her do it, but after supper she went to the laundry room and found that Caleb had washed her clothes as well. She took them out of the dryer and got the iron out; she may as well iron the clothes. Afterwards she took Caleb's clothes to his room, after putting them away she noticed a book that was half hidden under his pillow. The Love Dare. She flipped through it, it certainly explained a lot. He was probably using it in an effort to win her back. She wondered idly, as she put it back on which day he was. She put it back and left the room. 00000 ","Summary":" Based on the film, Fireproof , which I don't own but absolutely love.

My fic \"TGS: Unfortunate Truth\" is not finished, obviously, but I've been kind of stuck. I do have an end already planned for it, but I just need to get it to that point (PM me any ideas/suggestions please). Well, over a year ago, I started to get an idea for an alternate ending. Before you read it, I want to explain a couple things: 1- The setting for this alternate ending is in an old abandoned building that Henry knows very well, but Jen doesn't. So, she gets kind of lost, which gives Henry an opportunity to trap her. This building was inspired by one in both 90TheGeneral09 and Phorosz 's fanfictions. 2- The item Jen has was acquired while she was looking through drawers for a weapon. 3- I really wanted more of a physical struggle/fight to happen, but I suck at writing fight scenes. (This is something I hope to fix one day, as I LOVE to read fight scenes. Phorosz and 90TheGeneral have been awesome at those. I applaud you guys). I think that's it, so here you go... Just one door at the end of this hall. Jen had to make a decision. And fast. Henry wasn't too far behind. His voice had been getting closer and closer, \"I know this place like the back of my hand, darling. Give up. You won't escape.\" Jen bolted toward the door and entered the room right as Henry stepped around the corner. He had caught a glimpse of her and grinned, \"Won't find your way out in there.\" Knowing that he had her where he wanted her, he calmly walked to the door. Jen scanned the room, desperately searching for any other way out. Nothing. Not even a window. It was just a chilly, empty space. And she was trapped. She turned back toward the door and locked it right as Henry stopped on the other side, \"Through running now, aren't you?\" . As he tried turning the knob, Jen backed herself into a corner and cursed under her breath. \"One, two... Henry's coming for you...\" Another sing-song. Then laughter. \"...three, four...\" CRASH! Jen flinched, shielding her face as the door had been kicked in and landed just a couple feet away from where she stood. He finished the song as Jen looked to him in horror, \"...can't be stopped by a door.\" This was it. Though she had hoped not to, it looked as though she'd have to use the item she found earlier. Her left hand went into a pocket and rested on it as Henry smiled perversely at her from the doorway. \"Nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide.\" Jen pulled the object out of her pocket and held it up to give Henry a clear view of it. The sick delight on his face faded. Now, he was furious. \"Where did you get that?!\" \"You know where I got it. Now, I suggest you let me go.\" Jen demanded as her eyes narrowed into a glare. But Henry's fury didn't last. Now he was smiling, \"Or what? You'll use it? Jen, my darling, that's a grenade. You'll die too. Are you really willing to go that far? I don't think so. I know you.\" \"You DON'T know me! Not anymore! So shut the fuck up!\" Henry took a step into the room and started toward her, but froze immediately as Jen placed a hand on the pin to show that she was serious. \"I fucking mean it, Henry! Don't test me!\" Henry feigned a sigh of defeat and raised both hands in the air, \"Okay, take it easy there. What about Mark? You don't want to disappoint him, do ya? He'd hate to lose you.\" Jen looked down at the grenade in her hand. Did it really have to be this way? It seemed there was no choice. She was finally in control and could easily beat Henry, but he was right... she'd die alongside him. Taking in a deep breath, Jen looked back at him again and spoke calmly, \"He'll be fine.\" And then, she began to walk toward him. Henry tilted his head and flashed a sweet, sincere smile. \" What? One last kiss?\" He then teased her by puckering his lips. This didn't phase Jen as she stopped a couple feet away from him. She just stared him down for a moment before speaking up one more time, \"Go to HELL!\" The pin was then pulled from the grenade and both dropped to the ground as Jen grabbed onto Henry and slammed him up against a wall, holding him there by the throat. Henry firmly grabbed hold of Jen's arms, preventing her from going anywhere, and pulled her so close that her face was only centimeters from his, \"I'll save you a seat.\" He then raised a hand and grabbed a fistful of hair on the back of her head and forced her lips against his before everything went dark and collapsed. ENDING NOTE: The \"I'll save you a seat\" was inspired by a part in Buffy The Vampire Slayer (tv series). I am a HUGE fan. ","Summary":" AUTHOR NOTE: Hello!

He was falling. Just moments ago, Henry had been so sure that his mother would choose him. He was her son, after all, right? Why wouldn't she have? But yet again, Mark had thrown a wrench into his plans. Why did he have to do that? Ever since that boy from Arizona had arrived nine days ago, he had been nothing but a wimp and spoilsport. But Mark had shown an odd courage when standing up to him and denouncing his actions. The kid had an inner strength that Henry hadn't anticipated, and that frustrated him to no end. Mark thought that he should have compassion on others, but whatever this 'compassion' was, it probably meant being all sorry and nice. And everything or everyone he had done something to didn't deserve that. What about the dog? It was just a dog. There were more where it came from. His spikebow had needed testing, anyway. On a moving target. Mark had suggested he patent the weapon. Not a bad idea. Okay, then. What about Connie? Connie? Just an annoying little brat and something on which to vent his rage. Not to mention that she took up too much time and attention with their parents and Mark. And that she borrowed his stuff or came into his room without asking. That was unacceptable. She wasn't a part of his plan, of how his equation would unfold. So she had to be taken out of it for good. Unfortunately, her 'removal' didn't go as smoothly as Henry would have thought. For once, he couldn't blame Goody-Two-Shoes Mark for Connie's narrow survival at the quarry. Henry couldn't even really blame himself, either. His sister was like Mark – he had underestimated her inner strength. Richard? Old news and pretty much the same as Connie. He had taken up too much of their parents' time and attention, both things that could have been spent more on Henry. Not to mention stealing something of his – the toy whale. And so Richard also had to be taken out of the equation. Permanently. In the two years since, it had worked like a charm. Without a third kid around to further divert his parents' attention, Henry had gotten enough to satisfy him for a while, and they hadn't even remotely suspected him of being responsible for Richard's 'accident'. That is, until Mark came along. And Mom? Susan now had doubts about him. Her own son . She'd listened to Mark too much and had unwittingly forced him to get rid of the toy whale, and was doing her best not to tell him that she thought he was crazy. Out of his mind. And she wanted to put him into one of those 'places', somewhere that they sent total nutjobs to for life. Henry knew he wasn't like that. But if anyone was, it was her . Even with Richard gone, she was still obsessed with him. Keeping his room the same way it was when he died – for the past two years – was evidence enough of that. As a result of her lingering feelings for Richard and her obviously growing doubts, Henry knew she was no longer of any use. If she couldn't be his mother, she couldn't be anybody else's. She had to go. That was where the family's sudden trip to Acadia National Park had come in. There were a half dozen ways Henry could think of that his mother might suffer an 'accident' as well. The high cliffs were the easiest of those options. Once she was gone, he would tell his father – and the authorities – that Susan had simply slipped and fallen off. But practically from the start, he'd had to improvise. First off, there was Mark trying to stop him in the parking lot; Henry's father had made quick work of his cousin, and apparently, locked him in the family van. Secondly, the rock ledge ten feet below the edge of the cliff hadn't been anticipated. Still, he could very well have neutralized that obstacle had Mark not intervened yet again , to keep him away from Susan, who he claimed was now his mother, too. The cousins had fought without abandon, making their fight by the well the other night look tame by comparison. Then they went over the cliff – not entirely unexpected. Fortunately, his mother had caught them, ironically enough. Each boy had a grip, but with their combined weight, she couldn't possibly have pulled them both up. She had to make a choice. Henry had mustered all of the pull and charm he possibly could to convince her to choose him. Mark didn't deserve anything from her. Despite what he'd said, she was not his mother, too. She was Henry's. But, it seemed as if her love for him was waning, as if Mark had gotten to her. She had looked to Mark, who was sliding down the unraveling arm of her coat. Then she cast a long, mournful look at him, her son, and said in a tear-filled voice: \"Henry...Forgive me...\" And then she let go. Henry felt the wind whistle in his ears as he fell, eyes wide in surprise and an unexpected fear coursing through his veins. His arms and legs were spread, hands clawing at thin air for a handhold that would never come. His mouth let out a desperate yell, but it was too late. The last thing Henry felt in life was a sharp, wrenching crack, and a simultaneous, white-hot pain that lanced up his spine as he struck the rock shelf at the foot of the cliffs. And then he felt no more. In grim, despairing silence, Susan pulled Mark back over the edge of the cliff to safety. At that moment, Mark remembered some of the lyrics to a song he'd once heard: Black stare, the ink stains fill in the blank slate. Corrupt, bend to its own design... Design of blood and long forgotten years... Don't die in vain. No sacrifice or pain... Jack and Wallace skidded to a halt just behind them, not knowing what to think about what they had just seen happen. The four of them stared down at the rock far below. Henry's body had come to rest near the edge, and even now, the current lapped around his head. A trickle of blood oozed from the corner of his mouth, and his eyes, already cold even in life, were now still and unseeing, forever frozen in surprise. Surprise that his mother had chosen the life of his cousin over him. A wave crashed over his body, turning him facedown. Then a moment later, a second wave washed over him, and Henry was gone. Mark and Susan began to sob. Jack and Wallace both embraced them. Wallace gulped. \"Susan...\" Susan couldn't even form words. \"Daddy?\" Wallace turned to see Connie standing behind them. \"Oh, darling,\" he said, his eyes moist. \"Come here.\" \"Where's Henry?\" Connie asked as she walked over, voice and eyes both uncertain. It was the first time Mark had ever seen Wallace openly cry. Susan still clung to her nephew, in utter, unspeakable misery. She had done the worst thing a mother could possibly do. And she knew it was the right thing. Henry gasped as the cold of the wave enveloped him. He had never felt so cold before. He sat bolt upright on the rock and blinked his eyes. The last thing he remembered...was the pain. A sheer, intense pain unlike any he'd ever felt before. Another wave crashed toward him, and Henry cringed, bracing for the impact. But it never came. The water had passed straight through him. What the...? Henry stood to his feet. There was something weird going on here. As well as any twelve year-old could, he understood basic physics. There was simply no way he could have survived that fall. Something brushed against Henry's leg. Curious, he looked down, and stared – at his feet, a body was starting to float out into the bay on the reverse current. He wasn't too disturbed. So what? Just another dead person. But then Henry began to make out certain features of that body: blond hair pasted to a lifeless face, the back of a blue/green bomber jacket gashed open and covered in blood, faded jeans, and those mismatched Nikes... It was him . At that moment, reality struck Henry like a brick wall and he screamed, in a combination of rage and disbelief. He was dead. December 10, 1994. Mark trudged across the backyard of the Maine home, hands in his coat pockets. The trees were once again bare and swayed gently in a breeze off the bay. Brittle crunches echoed under Mark's feet, kicking up a small trail of old leaves in his wake as he neared the family cemetery. Ahead was Susan, crouched in front of two small, rough-hewn gravestones. A tall tree overhead cast shadows in the midday sunlight, shielding Mark's eyes from its blinding glare. Even without a body to bury, Wallace had still placed a marker there for Henry. It was the only thing they could have done for him. The only decent thing. Not like he would have done anything of the like, but still ... In the past year, beginning shortly after Henry's death, Mark had learned about and come to terms with what had afflicted his cousin. It hadn't been Henry's fault. He was simply born that way, with only the ability to feel the darker side of human emotion – anger, jealousy, hate, and pleasure from tormenting others. Without things like love, sorrow, and compassion, he had been left with an emotional void that could only be filled by the ones he knew. The clinical term was 'sociopath', but even Mark thought that that sounded a bit harsh. As a result, Mark had even been able to gather a bit of sympathy for his cousin. Mark crouched down beside Susan, and she glanced at him with watery eyes. There was no look of surprise on her face. She had known for a long time that he and his father were coming back to visit. Almost a year to the day since Mark's trial by fire had begun. The only thing she did was to give him a slight nod. Neither of them had to share a word. They now knew that they shared an unspoken bond. It had begun before Henry had died, and his death had only strengthened it. Mark bent to his knees and retrieved a bouquet of dead, brown flowers from the ground. Chrysanthemums. Susan now tended a whole garden's worth of them in warmer months. Then Mark took a second, fresh bouquet of the flowers from his aunt and laid it between the gravestones. Together, they rose to their feet and stood there for a time, staring down at both markers. One belonged to Richard, the other, Henry. \"No matter what, I still love him,\" Susan said, wiping the tears from her eyes. \"We'll never forget him,\" Mark said in a somber voice. \"Never,\" Susan whispered. Mark then slid his hand into Susan's and looked up into her eyes. She was his mother now. Or as close as he was ever going to get again. As if she'd read his mind, she smiled a little. \"Come on,\" she said. \"Let's go home.\" A sudden gust of wind rattled the branches overhead. Mark merely pulled his jacket tighter and followed his aunt back toward the house. But little did either of them know, they had and were still being watched, by something that, fortunately, neither knew was there. Because they, like the rest of the world, were blinded by their own ignorance. But he would make them see. Everyone would see. A/N: And so starts the Vengeance Trilogy , a multi-story sequel to The Good Son. What I'll be writing from is a slight AU, with only minor differences (like Mark and Henry having a fistfight over the family's water well instead of Henry tricking Mark into thinking he'd poisoned everything in the refrigerator) that lead to the same conclusion: Henry's death from falling off a cliff, albeit with a completely different location, but you get the idea. The song lyrics were composed by my older brother. As expected, I'll be starting largely from scratch, so any new chapters may very well be slow in coming. But they will happen. Also, I'm open to suggestions for fill-in plot ideas. I already have the basic structure of the story laid out, but I've always had trouble with 'fillers', e.g. stuff to bridge the gaps. I'm currently writing a flashback Mark has of the last real vacation he had before his mother died; he doesn't remember anything bad about it, but that's only because he long ago suppressed the memory of a near-death experience. Any suggestions on what that experience could have been? The setting for the flashback is a fictional mountainside lodge just outside Boulder, Colorado. It'll be something Henry uses against Mark later on. ","Summary":" Prologue A Blind World December 20, 1993. He was falling.

November 24, 1983. Thanksgiving Day. The brand-new, dark red Ford Tempo sedan coasted up to a stoplight in the outskirts of Rock Harbor, Maine. Its driver, thirty-three year-old Jack Evans, tapped his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel. The light was just the way Jack remembered it from over a decade before – slow. Just like everything else about Rock Harbor. It had been a great place to grow up in the '50s and comparatively wild '60s, but as soon as Jack had graduated high school in 1968 (three years after his older brother, Wallace), he took his full ride scholarship to Stanford for all it was worth and made a beeline for California. He made the most of those four years, getting a masters in the growing field of computer science. After that, Jack had decided to get in on the ground floor and started a computer software business in 1973. At first, he was solely working out of a mildly dingy apartment in San Diego, barely able to make ends meet even with a full time job stocking merchandise at a local Montgomery Ward's. Barely one or two calls per-month – requests for computer assistance – had been his average for just over a year. That is, until he met Janice. Janice Dolan was an attractive blonde, of average height, with long golden hair and hazel-green eyes, and despite the prevailing stereotypes about blonde women, Janice was of above-average intelligence. A native of Phoenix, Arizona, she'd gotten into San Diego University on a full ride scholarship of her own in the fall of 1970 and was about to graduate with honors and a masters in social work. Jack had fallen head over heels for her; Janice, though seemed hesitant about 'another computer geek' when she learned of Jack's profession. But after only three dates, Janice realized that Jack wasn't just 'some nerd' desperate for attention: he truly loved her. She graduated on June 7, 1974. Afterwards, instead of moving back to Phoenix, Janice moved next door to Jack and decided to help him organize his business into a more manageable structure. Though she had virtually no business experience, Janice's reorganization worked like a charm, and within months, calls from all over the state were coming in, and Jack soon hired his first employees (mostly unemployed post-college students), all while still working out of his apartment. Then, in a near-whirlwind series of events, Jack and Janice got engaged in December of '74, were married two months later, and moved themselves and the business to Phoenix. To this day, the business still operated out of that same office space near downtown. For the next six years, they'd lived a content and relatively well-balanced life. The one thing Jack remembered the best from those years was their US Bicentennial hike into the Grand Canyon in July of '76. He didn't think he could ever forget that. They'd started out on a trailhead near the rim, and however many hours later, they finally reached the bottom. It wasn't until then that Janice had even thought about the exhausting climb back up the trail. It had been, indeed, but just like the person she was, Janice never complained, even when she was obviously in pain. Fortunately, they'd had plenty of water between them and managed to make it back out without getting too dehydrated. Those memories and photos, however distant, always brought a smile to Jack's face. Jack looked over at Janice, seated in the passenger seat, and smiled at her. \"What are you thinking about, Jack?\" she asked, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth as well. \"Oh, just life,\" Jack said. \"That and the Grand Canyon. Remember?\" Janice laughed. \"Remember? How could I forget? I'm the one who talked you into it.\" Jack chuckled and nodded. The stoplight finally turned green, and the car glided through the intersection. Not a few miles on, Jack turned onto a narrow road, just barely wide enough for two cars to pass each other, and no lane markers whatsoever. A curtain of leaves kicked up behind the Tempo as it wound its way up the twisting ocean-side road. Eventually, it stopped on the right-hand side and Jack flicked on the turning signal, waiting for another car to pass in the opposite lane. Once it was clear, Jack made a left-hand turn into a driveway flanked by a pair of small, square stone columns. One was obviously a mailbox, while on the other hung a sign that read ' Private '. For the next several minutes, as the car made its way along the relatively narrow roadway, Janice admired the view of the Atlantic – Scotia Bay, she reminded herself – and instantly made a mental note to get back to the Pacific at some point. Living in Arizona, the closest they could get would be the northern Gulf of California, the only coastline the state had. Jack briefly noticed the look Janice had on her face. \"Guess it's been a while since you've seen this much water, huh?\" he asked. Janice nodded. \"I know you like to go swimming, Janice, but unless Wallace somehow added a heated indoor pool, you're all out of luck.\" She gave Jack a playful hit on the arm. \"I wasn't thinking about swimming here. Especially after your stories.\" \"Yeah,\" Jack said, chuckling. \"Even trying to swim in the summer we'd run the chance of getting pneumonia. Living on an inlet of the North Atlantic isn't exactly like living in Tampa or Galveston.\" Then they passed the crest of the drive and the house came into view. It was a large, rambling white house, built in the early 1900s, with a wraparound porch and four stone chimneys accentuating its New England-style appearance. There were already three cars parked at the very end of the driveway: a brand-new Chrysler station wagon, Wallace's 1970 Mustang, and a late '70s Ford Granada coupe. \"Looks like your parents beat us here,\" Janice said. Jack smiled wryly. \"Can't say that's a surprise.\" As their car coasted closer to the house, Janice turned in her seat and gazed on their only other passenger. \"Guess who's still asleep,\" she said, her eyes twinkling. Jack chuckled. \"Can't say that's a surprise, either.\" That passenger was their two year-old son Mark, buckled into his car seat and fast asleep in the back. The rambunctious toddler had protested rather vehemently, and not entirely in English, when they'd first started out from Arizona nearly five days ago. Fortunately, he'd finally quieted down after a quick stop at Oneida in western Oklahoma, and hadn't been much trouble since, aside from a few all too-obvious – and unfortunately normal – reasons. Jack finally brought their car to a halt beside the Granada, put it in park, and disengaged the engine. The silence was practically deafening. The only sound was that of the gentle crashing of the waves on the nearby rocks and the ticking of the cooling engine. Jack sighed in relief. \"We're here,\" he said, unbuckling his seatbelt and leaning heavily back in the seat. After letting that sink in, Jack finally got out, stretching his legs for the first time since their overnight stay in Albany, New York. Janice opened the rear passenger door and climbed into the backseat, where she unbuckled Mark and lifted the still-sleeping boy into her arms. Fortunately, she'd had the sense to put him into a good jacket as far back as Erie. Moments later, the front door opened and out came Wallace Evans. Roughly three years older than Jack, Wallace had combed back, wavy blond hair, and was dressed in a red sweatshirt and blue jeans. He jogged over to Jack and shook his hand before clapping him on the back. \"Good to see you, Jack.\" \"You too, Wallace,\" Jack replied. \"Have a good trip?\" Wallace asked. Jack smiled and nodded. \"Yeah. Except for Mark throwing a fit the first day or so out, we had no problems whatsoever.\" \"That's good,\" Wallace said. \"Henry tried something similar when Mom and Dad got here yesterday afternoon.\" \"They've been here since yesterday?\" Jack asked. His brother nodded. Jack grinned. \"Has Mom been telling Susan what to do in the kitchen? Or has Dad been stumbling over himself trying to get the TV working?\" Wallace groaned and nodded. \"Both.\" Jack just shook his head in amusement. \"That's just like them. But, hey, they're the ones who wanted to sell the house in the first place. They just had no idea you'd be the one to buy it.\" Now Wallace chuckled. \"True.\" Then he turned to greet Janice. \"Long time no see, Janice,\" he said, a warm smile on his face. \"You too, stranger,\" Janice replied with a wink, accepting a quick, and rather awkward hug from her brother-in-law. \"So, this is Mark,\" Wallace guessed, looking down at the brown-haired toddler asleep in Janice's arms. \"This is my baby,\" Janice said, beaming with pride, gently stroking her son's hair. \"Then let's get in before he gets cold,\" Wallace suggested. Janice nodded in agreement. \"Jack, you mind getting the bags?\" Her husband nodded. Wallace laid a hand on Janice's shoulder and led her into the warmth of the house. The second Janice walked through the front door, a whole set of delicious smells met her nose. \"Turkey, stuffing, rolls, mashed potatoes, corn, and pie,\" Janice guessed. Wallace was impressed. \"Good nose, Janice.\" Janice cast a glance at Mark. \"Sometimes too good.\" That brought a hearty chuckle from Wallace. \"Wallace! That them?!\" a voice yelled out from the living room. Janice winced, and a sigh escaped Wallace's lips before he closed the door. \"Yes, Dad,\" he said in an exasperated tone. An older man, of average height and largely gray brown hair strode out into the entryway. \"What'd you say, Wallace?\" he asked. \"I said, 'Yes, Dad',\" Wallace grumbled. \"Oh, right,\" he said. The man then caught sight of Janice. \"Janice!\" Janice motioned for him to be quiet. \"Hi, Dan,\" she said in a low voice. \"It's good to see you, girl,\" Dan Evans said, embracing her in an awkward bear hug, much like Wallace had. Then he got a good look at Mark. \"And this must be the little guy I've been hearing so much about.\" \"Sure is,\" Janice said with pride. \"This is my little Mark.\" Dan gave Mark's head a gentle pat. \"He's a sound little sleeper, isn't he?\" \"That he is. But he can make a fuss when he wants to,\" Janice said. \"Oh, don't they all,\" Dan said. \"I had Wallace's little rascal running around last night, sounding like an Indian. Feather on the head and everything.\" \"I'm almost glad you did, Dad,\" Wallace said. \"That means I finally found someone to get all that energy out of Henry.\" \"Had that kid wailing like a banshee was more like it.\" Janice turned to see Amy Evans, Dan's wife, and her face lit up. \"Amy.\" Amy gave Janice a warm smile and embraced her daughter in-law. \"Janice. And he must be Mark.\" Janice nodded. Jack finally walked through the front door, laden with suitcases and carrying bags. He looked around the entryway. \"Well don't stop on my account. Just bringing in the bags is all.\" \"Good to see you too, Jack,\" Amy said, her voice underlain with a mild hint of sarcasm. \"Here, let me help you with those,\" Dan said, moving forward, his hands outstretched. Jack gratefully handed him two of the heavier bags and started toward the steps. Then he turned to Wallace. \"Which room did you say, Wallace?\" \"Middle one, second floor.\" Jack looked surprised. \"It's a tad small, isn't it?\" \"Figured you'd want to be close to Mark.\" \"Okay, so where's Mark sleeping?\" Jack asked. \"In Henry's room,\" Wallace replied. \"Our old room. Since Henry's already using a bed, I set up his old crib in there for Mark.\" Jack nodded. \"Thanks, Wallace. We weren't entirely certain Mark would go for a sixth night in a bed. And somehow, he sleeps better in the car.\" Wallace just shrugged. \"What can I say? Kids.\" \"That about sums it up,\" Jack said as he trudged up the stairs, his father trailing behind, lugging the leather suitcases. Then Mark seemed to choose that moment to wake up. A surprisingly loud yawn issued from his mouth and his eyes flickered open. The first thing he saw was Janice. \"Hey, you,\" Janice said. \"We were wondering when you were going to wake up, sleepyhead.\" Mark gazed up at her with his light green eyes. \"Mark a sleep-head?\" he asked. Janice nodded, a smile on her face. \"How long has he been talking?\" Amy asked. \"Six or seven months, give or take,\" Janice replied. \"That's about how long Henry's been talking,\" Wallace said. \"He was trying before that, but what came out wasn't even remotely English.\" Mark looked over at Wallace. \"Inglish?\" he asked, curious. Wallace laughed. \"Well, he's close, I'll give him that.\" \"Sounds like I'm missing some fun out here,\" a voice sounded from behind Amy. That was Susan, Wallace's wife of nearly six years. \"Susan! Look who's here,\" Janice said, lightly bouncing Mark in her arms. \"Is that who I think it is?\" Susan asked, a touch of excitement in her voice. \"Meet my little Mark,\" Janice said. \"Mark sleep-head,\" the toddler replied. Susan smiled. \"He's adorable, Janice.\" \"Thanks. What about yours?\" Janice asked. \"Henry? As far as I know, he's still sleeping. Dan ran him pretty ragged last night with the whole Indian routine, and I can't entirely say I'm sorry about that. Little guy's been running me ragged the past few months.\" What sounded like a hooting and warbling noise suddenly came from upstairs, and Susan shook her head. \"Speak of the little devil.\" Moments later, a small blond-headed figure with shaggy hair came bounding down the stairs, still calling out in that strange noise. Dan and Jack followed; Jack had adopted a look of bewilderment, while his father seemed ready to burst out laughing. The blond-haired figure skidded to a stop on the bottom landing, backed up a few steps, and launched himself into the air. Janice gasped. But the boy landed, upright and on his feet in the entryway, grinning confidently and looking none the worse for wear. He had greenish-blue eyes and was wearing a slightly oversized navy-blue Falmouth Atlantics jersey and jeans. But what really caught everyone's attention was the feather strapped to the back of his head by a worn leather band. \"Hey-lo!\" the boy called out. He thumped his chest. \"Henry.\" Susan smiled wryly. \"Janice, Jack. Meet my little angel, Henry.\" Henry thumped his chest again, nodding his head vigorously. Wallace knelt in front of his son. \"You know your grandparents, right? Well, this here's your Aunt Janice, that's your Uncle Jack with Grandpa, and the little boy your aunt's holding, that's Cousin Mark. He's your age.\" His son held up two fingers, and Wallace nodded, grinning with pride. Mark's eyes were wide. He still had no idea what was going on. Who were all these people? And this other boy? \"Henny?\" Mark asked timidly. Wallace chuckled. \"Again, he's close.\" \"Hen- ry ,\" Henry corrected, thumping his chest. \"Uh-oh,\" Mark said, eyes wide. Everyone grinned at that. A/N: As usual, reviews are appreciated. Opinions so far? Technology-wise, this is set in an AU similar to ' Something About Mark ', and could, in some ways be considered a prequel to that story as well. But, for the purposes of this story, it is part of the original TGS universe. It will be longer, though I'm not figuring on more than another two or three ( maybe four) chapters at most.

Rated: T for references to violence Spoilers: Mild spoilers for the movie. Then again, I doubt those that haven't seen this movie will be reading this story, as this movie isn't a popular one for fan fiction... Author's Note: I saw \"The Good Son\" in the theatres when I was 11 years old and loved it. In real life both Mac Culkin and Elijah Wood (the actors who play Henry and Mark, respectively) are older than me, however, for the purpose of this story I arbitrarily chose them to be eleven years old (both Henry and Mark were supposed to be in the same grade and roughly the same age in the movie). Also, while I know the actual famous \"cliff hanger\" scene (no pun intended) wasn't actually filmed in Maine, the movie is supposed to take place in Maine. Also, both Mark and Henry have the same last name (Evans) because Henry's Dad (Wallace Evans) is Mark's father's brother... in other words Henry's Dad is Mark's Uncle by blood (his Uncle Wallace is his father's actual brother, hence, they both have the same last name)... hope that's not too confusing. Additional Notes/Warnings: I am very interested in Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD) and attachment disorders in general, and how they develop. In \"The Good Son\" there was seemingly no real reason for Henry's lack of conscience/inability to \"attach\". He wasn't abused by his parents (at the very least, the parents in the movie aren't depicted as abusive), he wasn't neglected, etc... However, I will have a short scene with Mark's father talking to Mark about RAD and attachment disorders. Kind of philosophical fan fiction for a B-horror movie, I guess, but there you go. Please read and review! Also, in case anyone is interested, because Henry was younger than 18, if he had been evaluated by a psychiatrist (who could see past his lies) he most likely would have been diagnosed with Conduct Disorder, and possibly Reactive Attachment Disorder. If he'd survived to adulthood, if nothing had changed in his personality, he would be diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder. The terms \"sociopath\" and \"psychopath\" are not technically diagnoses, anymore than the term \"psychotic\" is. However, whatever the technical label, Henry was definitely a psychopath. What if there was this boy? And he did these terrible things because he liked doing them? Would you say he was evil? I don't believe in evil. You should. Mark Evans woke up gasping, sweating... a scream dying in his throat. A cold sweat covered his small, thin body. His heart was hammering in his chest furiously. He felt chilled to the bone, even though his room was fairly warm and he was back in Nevada. He'd been dreaming about Henry again- well, not exactly about Henry this time, but the time with Henry, when he had tried to warn others, when he hadn't been believed. Somehow not being believed had been almost worse than Henry's actual behaviour. Almost. The therapist... her name had been Davenport. Alice Davenport. And she'd only thought he was a screwed up little kid. She hadn't believed Henry was evil. Or sick. Or whatever he'd been . Henry had fooled them all. Almost killed Susan... almost... Mark rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but he knew it was useless. He got out of bed, grabbed his house coat and softly walked out of his room, into the living room, the kitchen. \"What are you doing up?\" Mark screamed, startled, but it was only his father, staring at him with concerned, gentle eyes. \" Mark ?\" Mark sighed heavily. Hung his head. Sighed again. C'mon, calm down. It's just Dad. Not Henry. Henry's dead, remember? \"Bad dreams?\" His father ventured softly. He wasn't surprised when his son nodded, eyes averted. \"This is the fifth time this week , Mark...\" His father sighed gently. He was sitting in the living room, on a chair in front of the computer. Late night work. He'd closed the deal in Tokyo, and things were okay, but he still pulled a lot of all-nighters. \"So?\" Mark said warily, wandering into the kitchen. He opened a cupboard and grabbed a glass from Pizza Hut. A Jurassic Park drinking glass. His favourite. The one with Lex and Timmy and the Raptors... The boy filled it with orange juice, and then replaced the cartoon to the fridge. He stopped for a moment, staring blankly at a school photograph of himself from the previous fall sticking to the fridge, held in place by a happy-face magnet. The photo had been taken just 3 or 4 months ago. Back in September. But he wasn't the same person anymore, was he? That photo had been from before ... Before his mom had died. Before he'd gone to live with Henry and learned that evil could take on the form of a child... and learned that he could try to warn others, and not only be disbelieved, but condemned as insane for telling the truth. Before the dog had been shot and thrown in the well in the graveyard. Before Connie had almost drowned in ice water. Before the 10 car pile-up \"accident\", care of Mr. Highway. Before he'd almost died by falling off the cliff. Before Henry had died, his brains splattering all over the rocks... That photo wasn't even him anymore. He'd never be that same Mark again. There were too many afters , now. Dark and serious afters . His father's low, gruff, gentle voice jerked him out of his sanguine reverie. \"Mark... maybe talking to someone about what happened might help? About Henry?\" Mark took a gulp of his juice and came back into the living room, sat down on the couch. Stared at his father angrily. He felt frustrated. \" Right , Dad,\" Mark snapped, sighing heavily. \"Because when I told them about Henry before everyone believed me...\" \"Mark...\" his father sighed and finally got up from his chair, walked over and sat on the couch next to his son. \"Nobody could have known... I mean, with Henry, his behaviour, what he was doing... nobody knew .\" \"They knew. Because I was telling them. They just didn't believe me.\" \"Mark...\" his father trailed, not sure how to express all he wanted ( needed ?) to say to his eleven-year-old son. Henry had only been dead a little over a month, and due to the fall it had been a closed casket funeral. That had disturbed Jack. Sometimes Jack Evans wondered if his son truly believed Henry was dead. Without a body to see, maybe touch... without seeing Henry close-up and dead, truly dead and unable to ever hurt another human being again... without that proof would Mark ever have closure? Ever stop jumping at shadows? Waking with startled shrieks in the middle of the night? He'd been sullen and withdrawn after the death of his mother, filled with grief and self-blame. In his mind he'd been ravaged by guilt: he'd promised his mother that he, an 11-year-old, wouldn't let her die. But cancer didn't care about magical thinking. Mark's mother had died anyway. That death had hit Mark hard enough, but since the events in Maine, since his time with Henry, since that death... He'd had a hard time with his mother's death, but he'd been coping. Now he was a pale, ghostly, jumpy shell of the boy he'd once been. The doctors said he was suffering from something called Acute Stress Disorder. That it could develop into a more serious condition called PTSD if Mark wasn't treated promptly. Jack Evans had thought only war veterans developed PTSD, but the child psychologist on the phone had set him straight, outlined all the possible traumas severe enough to induce it. Any profound sense of horror or helplessness, especially when combined with the fear of one's own imminent demise, was enough to cause the condition. Apparently the impact was greater if the trauma was deliberately caused by a human or humans, as opposed to a natural disaster or an accident. The fact that Mark hadn't been believed when he'd tried to warn not only his aunt and uncle, but also the local therapist, made the situation even worse, apparently. Not only had the boy's sense of safety in the world been crushed, but he'd been disbelieved. And he'd almost died himself, after trying to warn his aunt that her life had been in danger. Jack sighed and shut his eyes briefly, not for the first time trying to imagine his son's confusion and grief. First, he'd been left with relative strangers right after his mother's death. Then, he'd been bewildered and confused by Henry's increasingly violent- albeit secretive- behaviour. Then he'd treated as if he were delusional when he'd tried to warn his aunt and uncle... all culminating with his aunt holding onto each boy by a single hand, 180 feet above a rocky, Atlantic shore, having to make an impossible decision. Had Mark thought she was going to let him drop after all the times he'd warned them? All the pleading? Had he thought he was going to die right then and there, plummet to his death? Worse, during and after Henry's funeral, Susan had refused to even look at Mark. Jack could understand why. The entire incident was too fresh, and her little boy- monster or not- hadn't even been buried yet. But at the same time, Jack felt anger for the woman. Mark hadn't killed his baby brother, or tried to kill his mother. Or tried to drown his sister. Mark wasn't Henry. Hell, Mark had risked his life to save her life, a grown woman's and what had he gotten for his trouble? He'd almost fallen to his death while Henry's mother deliberated about whether to save her compassionate nephew or murderous son. And if they had listened to Mark, Henry probably wouldn't have even died... He exhaled a bit louder. Who was he to blame anyone? Even he hadn't really believed Mark... not really . He'd guessed something was wrong, but had expected Mark was exaggerating. That Henry was perhaps just a little too extroverted for Mark. A little too rough, maybe. But honestly, he hadn't suspected anything more than that, and certainly nothing... nothing like what they ultimately discovered. Nobody had. Nobody had seen Henry for what he was, not in his entire eleven years of life. Nobody... except for Mark. Jack Evans glanced over at his son. Mark was still sitting on the couch, sipping his orange juice pensively, staring at the carpet. \"Mark?\" Jack Evans said, shaking his head as if he could clear away the thoughts that easily. His son looked up, drank the last of his orange juice and put the empty glass on the coffee table. \"I want you to speak to someone. I can't...they will believe you. That will never happen again. Somebody not believing you.\" \"Only because they have evidence and have to believe me now,\" Mark snapped angrily, getting up of the couch and taking his glass back to the kitchen. Jack heard the water running, knew Mark was rinsing the glass and placing it on the drying rack. The boy came back into the living room and sat back down on the couch. \"You're right. They have to believe you now... but I also think it would be good for you...\" \"You thought it would be good for me to stay with Henry!\" Mark said bitterly, pulling his knees up to his chin. \"Mark, Henry was sick . We both know that. Only... the part of him that was sick was very hard to see. It wasn't an obvious sickness.\" \"He was crazy ,\" Mark said softly, eyes slightly unfocused. Jack considered the term crazy, turned it over in his head. \"He was mentally ill. But he wasn't psychotic ... he wasn't out of touch with reality, Mark. He knew what he was doing. That's why he managed to get away with it for so long. That's why he was so convincing, why everybody believed him...\" \"So he was evil, then? Like I first said. Like I told Doctor Davenport...\" \"He...well, the technical term for it would be psychopath, I guess.\" Jack stopped himself. Did Mark really need to know all of this? \"He... well, you know how you feel badly if something bad happens to another person? Henry couldn't feel that. Ever. It was like the part of your brain and my brain that allows us to feel badly for other people never formed.\" \" Why ?\" Mark asked, looking at his father with haunted, blue eyes. Jack Evans shrugged and sighed tiredly. \"I'm not sure, son. Lots of people have lots of different theories. Some people think it's because a child is raised without love, or hurt early. But we both know Uncle Wallace and Aunt Susan never hurt Henry. So that only leaves nature.\" \"Nature? You mean he was born just... not caring?\" Jack Evans shrugged and wrapped an arm around his son. \"Maybe. We don't know. And Henry is dead, so we can't ask him why he thought and felt the way he did.\" \"Even if you could, he'd probably lie anyway,\" Mark informed, leaning into his father's hug. \"Probably.\" \" Dad ?\" \"Mmm?\" \"Uncle Wallace was Henry's Dad. And Uncle Wallace is your brother. Which means... Henry is related to me by blood .\" \"Mark, you're not like Henry, if that's what you're worried about. The fact that you're worried about being like him is proof that you're not.\" \"What if I am, and I don't know it yet? Or I am fooling you? Like Henry fooled everybody?\" \"Mark, you're nothing like Henry,\" Jack hugged his son tighter, but Mark stiffened. \"But how do you know ?\" His young voice was softer and raspier than normal. \"I don't. I can't. But I don't think you are.\" \"But what if I am like him?\" \"Mark, if you're that worried, you could speak to a doctor...\" \"You mean a head shrinker. A therapist or something. Like Dr. Davenport. Except she couldn't tell what Henry was, either ...\" \"Mark, she was a small-town therapist. She wasn't a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist. She had never had any cases dealing with, well... children like Henry before. She did grief counselling .\" \"So?\" \"Mark, if you speak to someone who knows about these things- about kids like Henry- will that put your mind at ease? You don't even have to speak about what happened. You can just... say what you want. Whatever's on your mind. This fear you have that you may be like Henry...\" Mark was silent, absorbing. Considering. Finally he nodded. \"I don't have to say anything I don't want to?\" \"'Course not.\" \"Okay. If you think it's a good idea.\" \"I do.\" \"I really didn't know he was going to drop that dummy... Mr. Highway ... onto the road. I didn't know , Dad.\" \"Mark, I know you didn't know. And you were terrified after.\" The 11 year old looked up, blinking back sudden tears as the memory of that day flooded back. He could see Henry leaning over the railing, watching the cars screech and slam into each other, smirking and bobbing his head delightedly as each vehicle crashed... God. \"I...didn't know about the dog, either. Or... I knew he was dangerous. But I tried... and Susan almost died...\" Jack Evans pulled his son closer, cradling his head under his own. Like he had when Mark had been very small. The doctor was female and wore glasses and was younger than Alice Davenport. She smiled at the young boy broadly and extended her hand. \"You must be Mark. I've heard a lot about you. My name is Vickie.\" Mark glanced back at his father, who nodded his approval. Mark stood, accepted the hand. Shook it. \"You're not a doctor?\" Mark asked uncertainly. \"I am, actually. I'm a psychiatrist.\" \"So you can tell if kids are nuts or not?\" Vickie laughed a little. \"I'm not sure I'd use the term nuts , but I like to think I'm not too bad at my job. Feel like coming back to my office and talking for a bit? I won't bite.\" Mark looked back at his father again. Finally sighed and nodded and followed the young psychiatrist into her office. It was white and bright and would've looked antiseptic, but there were multiple bookcases and framed art on the walls, some of which had obviously been done by children. There were a few easels in the room and a sandbox, a large dollhouse on the floor. The bookcases that weren't full of books were stacked with board games and plastic baskets full of random toys that didn't seem to fit anywhere else. \"I'm not going to play with this stuff, if that's what you're thinking.\" Vickie nodded. \"Yeah, the toys. Unfortunately, when you work with kids, that means everything from toddlers to young adults.\" She stared at him for a moment. \"I'm not going to draw anything, either. You already know what happened.\" \"Okay. So you don't like to draw and you don't like to play. Any other dislikes?\" \"Do you think I'm crazy?\" Mark blurted. He wanted to get this over with. That was the only reason he was here. \"From the... what? Two minutes I've known you? No.\" Vickie sounded amused. \"But then again, you'll have to define what you think crazy means .\" Mark sighed and wandered over to a bean bag chair. Sat down on it. All the chairs, except for Vickie's, were tiny. There was a couch but it smelled strangely of cigarette smoke, which reminded Mark of Henry. \"Lacking a conscience. Like Henry did.\" \"Your cousin?\" Vickie asked. \"Yeah.\" \"I think if you were like Henry...no, Mark, I don't think you're like Henry. But I understand why you're afraid you might be.\" \"Why?\" Mark croaked, lifting his head to meet her eyes. \"Because to you, Henry is evil. Henry did do evil things. He hurt people. He tried to kill you, your aunt, your cousin... and he killed his little brother.\" \"And he could've killed people in that crash he started.\" Mark added. Vickie nodded. \"Nobody else ever noticed that Henry was... the way he was, either, did they? Only you did. And when you tried to tell them, they didn't believe you.\" \"Yeah,\" Mark said again, even softer this time. \"That must have been pretty scary. Knowing what he was capable of, maybe even knowing he had something planned, and not being believed.\" \"It was ,\" Mark exhaled loudly, and put his face in his hands. \"But that's not why you're worried you're like him, is it? There's more to it than that?\" Mark was silent for a moment. There was, but he wasn't sure himself how to describe the fear that was gnawing away inside him. \"Why was Henry... the way he was? Why did he do those things?\" Vickie was silent a moment, thinking. She'd treated children like Henry Evans before, destructive and violent children. Some, like Henry, had also killed. Most of the kids like Henry had been abused and neglected as infants, but according to what Mark's father had told her over the phone, that hadn't been the case with the Henry. In other cases... the cause was a mystery. \"Mark, I don't know exactly why Henry turned out the way he did. What I do know is that, for whatever reason, when Henry was really little he didn't bond to his mom. Or to anyone.\" \"What do you mean?\" Mark asked warily. \"Mark...when we're little, when we're babies, we learn to develop a conscience and sense of empathy and trust by how we bond to our parents. Usually our mothers.\" \"Susan is a good mother!\" Mark protested, eyes flashing. \"Connie turned out fine! Henry is just evil !\" \"Mark, listen to me. I'm not saying your Aunt Susan wasn't a good mother to Henry. Only that... for whatever reason... Henry didn't bond to her when he was a baby. For some reason we don't know, and probably never will know. But you did bond to your Mom. That's why you felt so upset when she died.\" \"Yeah. But...what does that mean ?\" Vickie sighed. Not for the first time she wished someone would write a book about attachment disorders for the 6 to 12 year old crowd. \"It means, Mark, you're not like Henry. Kids like Henry, kids without consciences, they don't care if they are evil or not. All they care about having fun. Unfortunately for the rest of us, their idea of fun usually involves hurting other people or animals. The fact that you're worried about being like Henry proves that you're not like him. Does that make any sense?\" \"My Dad said the same thing to me the other night,\" Mark remarked glumly, still not convinced. \"Mark,\" Vickie sighed, removed her glasses and cleaned the lenses. Put them back on. \"Did Henry say anything to you that made you think, or feel, that you might be like him?\" Mark shuddered. Could remember running across the bridge and sliding down the embankment. Breathing heavily in the tunnel as police cars screeched to the accident overhead. I feel sorry for you, Mark. You just don't know how to have fun. What? It's because you're scared all the time. I know. I used to be scared too. But that was before I found out. Found out what? That one you realize that you can do anything...you're free. You can fly. Nobody can touch you... nobody. Mark...don't be afraid to fly. You're sick. \"Mark?\" Vickie asked, leaning forward. \"Uh, sorry.\" \"You okay?\" \"Yeah,\" Mark heaved another sigh. \"Henry... he said something once. He said I was like him. That I was scared, and that he used to be like me... scared all the time. And that he changed, that he found out he could do anything. And you know what? He did.\" \"So, because Henry shared this with you... this secret of his... you're scared you might become like him?\" Mark looked up at the psychiatrist, blue eyes haunted. Nodded slowly. Mark sat in the waiting room and his father went in. \"I think Mark is doing remarkably well considering everything he's been through in the last 2 months...\" the psychiatrist told Jack Evans evenly. \"But I'm not going to lie to you. He's deeply afraid of becoming like Henry. Of becoming, as he puts it, evil . He's going to need a lot of reassurance that he's not evil, not like Henry; that the events in Maine were completely out of his control.\" \"I know,\" Jack sighed. \"I've tried to talk to him, but he refuses to talk about specific incidents. Susan told me early on, shortly after I got there and the police were still investigating... something about a dog that was killed and thrown down a well. And the accident on the road, of course, but I know more happened... and Mark, he won't say anything. I tried to get Susan to talk to him. Wallace- my brother- got on the phone. Said she couldn't . Wasn't ready, apparently. But I think this really needs to come from Susan. Despite what happened on that cliff, she was the first person to realize what Henry was. After Mark, I mean.\" Vickie nodded solemnly. \"But I can't exactly make her talk to my son, now, can I? Hell, my own brother won't return my phone calls. We weren't particularly close before all of this, but he never ignored me like this ...\" \"Mr. Evans, we can't control what your brother or sister in law do, but right now, how you treat Mark will make a big difference.\" \"So... what? I just keep telling him night after night that he's not evil? That we believe him now ? That Henry is dead and he did nothing wrong and...\" Vickie was nodding. \"Yeah. Pretty much. And anything else that validates his experiences, makes him feel safe.\" \"He is safe,\" \"But he doesn't feel safe. He's afraid of his own mind, his own conscience.\" \"He's afraid of other children . Other kids his age, boys. Scared they might be like Henry...\" Jack trailed tiredly. \"He's started skipping school, I keep getting phone calls from his teachers reporting that he never came back from recess or back from lunch break, or the endless calls from the school nurse because he's sick or has a stomach ache or a head ache or a sore throat...\" \"Somatic complaints are very common anxiety symptoms in children Mark's age,\" Vickie said calmly. Jack Evans nodded tiredly. \"But...kids... I mean, do they ever recover from things like this?\" \"Mr. Evans, your wife died about 2 months ago, a little less? And then Mark was with Henry for two weeks? He's had less than two months to really process all of this. All of these traumas.\" \"So you're saying that he'll be fine,\" Jack stated. \"I'm saying that, to me, he seems like a very resourceful and resilient kid. A sensitive kid, but resilient. I think he'll be okay.\" \"And if he's not okay?\" Jack Evans asked morbidly, locking onto the psychiatrist's eyes. \"Then we take further steps. Right now, though... he just needs time to adjust. To work through all of this.\" Jack Evans nodded and stood. Held out his hand. Vickie shook it firmly. Just in time. Her next case was coming in, a ten year old girl who had seen her parents butchered to death by the mother's ex-husband. \"Hey, co-pilot ,\" Jack Evans said as they drove home. Mark was playing with his game boy, the same game, from the sound of it, which he'd played on his trip over to Maine about six weeks ago. \"You gonna' stop bombing the universe and pay attention to me?\" Jack asked his son gently, glancing over. Mark paused the game and looked up. \"What?\" \"You're not crazy. You're not like Henry. She told me.\" \"I don't think she knows. She told me she doesn't know why some kids turn out like Henry,\" Mark said sullenly, returning to his game. The electronic beeps and blips started anew. Jack Evans sighed. \"Oh, she did, did she?\" \"Yeah,\" Mark muttered, shaggy head still focused on the electronic game. \"Did she tell you about the DSM? About Reactive Attachment Disorder? Or Conduct Disorder?\" The game boy was paused again. Mark glanced back at over at his father. \"No,\" Mark said honestly. \"What are those?\" \"Two illnesses that Henry might have suffered from. She even photo-copied the symptoms of each of them out. I was thinking when we get home, we can go down the list and see how many of the symptoms you have for each. If you're still scared?\" Mark shrugged. \"Okay.\" And once again he was back to the video game. \" None of them?\" Mark asked, grabbing the papers from his father, looking them over. \"I have none of the symptoms? Of either of them?\" \"Nope. Sorry kiddo.\" Mark smiled. \"Are you sure? Did you double-check?\" \"Yup.\" Jack Evans was smiling. \"Can we put these up on the fridge?\" \"Um...how bout you pin them up on the corkboard in your room. You think?\" Mark nodded and grabbed the Xeroxed papers and ran out of the room. Resilient, indeed. -FIN- I had to finish this a lot faster than I initially wanted to. I realize it's more angst and h/c than drama or action, but this story takes place after the events of the movie. However, like I mentioned in my author's notes above, abnormal psychology interests me greatly, especially juvenile delinquency and attachment theories, so I may write more stories dealing with these issues.

This time Henry didn't follow. Not for the first ten minutes of the walk home, at least. It amazed Mark how long the walk back was; maybe the shock of what he'd done- what he'd just helped Henry do- made it seem all the longer. But Henry crossed the road one more time, and came up beside Mark. When he did, Mark realized Henry had not at all decided to leave him alone. He'd gotten the message, surely; Mark's actions must have shouted that he didn't want to talk to Henry. But his cousin was here, walking quietly beside Mark. Thinking. What about became clear when Henry spoke. And when he did, it was with a different tone than before. Not gleeful, or mocking. But serious, excited in a new way- as if Henry was eager to hear Mark's response but trying not to show it. \"Mark, how did it make you feel when your mother died?\" Anger flared within Mark. The nerve of even asking something like that, after causing that pileup on the highway! \"Shut up.\" \"Mark. I want to know. How did it make you feel?\" Mark halted, his shoes scraping on the cold, ice-encrusted edge of the pavement. Henry stopped too, without a sound. Mark looked him straight in the eyes. Henry's eyes were cold; they always were. But his face was solemn, and his manner- apparently- sincere. For whatever reason, he really was asking. Henry prompted him. \"Did it make you feel helpless, Mark? Like there was nothing you could do?\" Mark nodded, slowly. That was true, but why did Henry care? Henry looked straight at Mark, a strange light dancing in his eyes. \"Mark, you have to stop being afraid all the time. You have to stop letting the world control you , and start controlling it .\" Mark looked at his cousin, his emotions in turmoil. What they'd just done… it was unforgiveable. It was wrong in every way. Afterwards Henry's joy at the carnage had been just sickening. But what was he doing now ? Mark put his confusion into a question. \"What do you mean? How can you talk about this, after what you just did-\" Henry cut him off. \"It's about who you want to be, Mark. Man or mouse?\" This question Mark just didn't understand. He wanted to turn away, to put his back to Henry and ignore him completely. Just walk home. But something- Mark couldn't say what- kept him from actually doing it. Henry repeated the question. \"Man or mouse?\" Thoughts and emotions swam around in Mark's head, and his heart. Reasons for either answer waged war in his mind. But ultimately Henry's words in the tool shed came back to him. \"I can show you something amazing. Something you'll never forget. Are you in?\" A long time seemed to pass; maybe it was just a minute or two, but it felt like eternity. Finally Mark spoke. \"Man.\" And Henry smiled. \"No more tests, Mark. You've passed.\" Mark looked at his cousin, shocked. \"You were testing me? All those times! Kicking me at the table, then the dog, then this!\" Henry nodded. \"That's right.\" \"So what happens now?\" Henry shrugged. \"I don't know just yet. But it's cold, and they'll be looking for whoever dropped Mr. Highway.\" A smile crept back onto Henry's face, one that glinted off his ice-blue eyes. Henry had an idea, and Mark found he was, in spite of himself, somewhat excited to find he was a part of it once more. Henry gestured down the road where they'd been walking. \"Let's head home, brother.\" And the two walked on in a silence much more comfortable than before, side by side observing the lead-gray sky and the newly-fallen snow.[Chapter 2] CHAPTER II- Lies for Dinner Mark was quiet during dinner, and had to be reminded to touch his food. His stomach felt like it was in a knot; a knot of lingering guilt over what had happened, confusion about what Henry had said to him, and uncertainty of what would happen next. Susan asked if something was wrong and Mark almost told her, his doubts and fears nearly winning him over. But then he caught sight of Henry, watching him calmly. Say what you like, the look said. I'm not worried. And you shouldn't be either. After a few moments the knot relaxed a little. It felt good, and Mark felt… different. Like things were going to be okay. Nobody had died today anyhow; just a few banged up cars. Mark had never felt like this before, never even considered thinking such things before meeting Henry. There were still too many doubts, too many questions. But the knot in his stomach relaxed some, and Mark was able to honestly answer Susan. \"No, everything's fine. Henry walked us up to that tavern in town.\" Susan smiled knowingly. \"The one that catches all their lobster off the coast?\" Mark nodded, and Henry smiled sheepishly, adding, \"We couldn't help ourselves. Just wanted to show Mark around, Mom.\" Susan relaxed completely at that, not doubting it for a second. \"I'm sure Mrs. McRoy was glad to see you showing Maine hospitality, Henry. But try to remember you've got one of the best cooks in town right at home, too.\" Henry gave that boyish smile of embarrassment again. \"Yes, Mom.\" Mark, meanwhile, was stunned. Not at Susan or even Henry, but at himself. Did he just help Henry tell a lie? No. He just told a lie. Henry helped him. Mark could hardly believe the words he'd spoken. But spoken them he had, regardless. Why? All through dinner Mark thought about what had happened; about Henry and what to do about him. Anything? Nothing? Henry clearly wanted to be a friend still, and Mark, reluctant as he was to admit it, was painfully aware of how badly he needed friends right now. His father and Alice Davenport were hardly good substitutes, and Susan, no matter how wonderful a person she clearly was, was still a mother. Henry could be a different kind of friend than any of them. Henry would glance at Mark from time to time, but when Mark looked back, it was with a calm enough face. Henry didn't seem worried from the start, but even so he might have relaxed a little. Once Mark saw Henry smile at him, and not in a cold or mocking way, but in a warmer, almost reassuring manner. As if he had read, or at least sensed Mark's conflicted thoughts, and was silently saying, \"It's all right. You're doing just fine.\" After dinner, Mark went into the kitchen and helped with the dishes. Susan was standing at the sink wearing an apron and yellow rubber gloves. She was rinsing the dishes and putting them into the dishwasher. Mark joined her, scraping the leftovers off the plates and into the garbage disposal. \"Oh, Mark,\" Susan said, \"you don't have to help.\" \"I want to.\" Mark said. \"Why don't you go play with Henry?\" Mark shrugged, but only a little. Susan glanced at him and frowned. \"It seems like something's bothering you. Is it because your father's only called once since he went away?\" Henry appeared in the doorway. \"Oh, Mom, we must've forgot to tell you- Uncle Jack called and told Mark when he landed in Tokyo that he might not be able to call for the next few days.\" Susan looked at Mark for confirmation. Though a little irked at Henry just inviting himself into the conversation he was having with Susan, Mark did appreciate Henry helping cover for him. He couldn't tell her the real reason he was feeling- not gloomy, just off balance, for now at least- so he decided to use his father as an excuse. \"Sort of.\" Mark said. Susan nodded sympathetically. \"It must be difficult for you right now.\" Mark nodded back. It was strange how his other problems had receded in the face of this new… problem? Situation. That was Henry. A situation wrapped in a cloak of mystery. Mark was really tempted to tell her about it. But how could he? Even though he felt a strong bond with Susan, he hardly knew her. And she hardly knew him. What would he say to her, anyway? Mark couldn't even decide what part of this to tell her about. \"When did he say he'd call again?\" Susan asked. Henry stepped in again. \"When he had time. Mark was really understanding about it, Mom. It's hard for Uncle Jack out there, and he's got a lot to do while he's in Japan. Mark told Uncle Jack all that.\" Mark looked at Henry, surprised. Was his cousin almost proud of him? Knowing Henry, he was faking it. But even if he was, for once Henry seemed to be faking it to help Mark, not just to get some kicks himself. And Mark appreciated that. But where Henry might have been faking, Susan was entirely sincere. She looked at Mark, smiling with almost a sense of wonder. \"You really are a good son, Mark. It's good that you understand that; a lot of boys your age wouldn't.\" Henry smiled, still leaning against the doorframe. \"Like me, huh, Mom?\" Susan laughed, feigning irritation and ordering Henry to pitch in with work on the dishes. Once they were all loaded in and the dishwasher humming away, she shooed them out of the kitchen with a plate of cookies. They were a mix of sugar and chocolate chip, some of the best cookies Mark had ever had. He and Henry finished them over the kitchen table, reading some old Sunday comics. Henry talked now and then about the older comics and even brought Mark some newer ones, but Mark wouldn't say much. For now, he really just wanted to avoid the whole issue of what had happened that day, and since Henry was part of the confusion that included him too. When Mark quietly told Henry this, he simply nodded, stood up and bowed gracefully to Mark, and left the room, leaving Mark with best old and new comics to be found in the house. Susan and Connie sat at a window seat near the kitchen window. Connie was cuddled in her mother's arms, and together they watched the snowflakes float down through the lights outside, Connie exclaiming in delight whenever they were pushed into beautiful swirling patterns by gusts of wind. Susan had a small color TV in the kitchen, and she usually listened to the local evening news while she cleaned. Mark wasn't even paying attention until he heard something about a four-car accident closing down all lanes of a highway. Four cars? They'd only thought it was three. Henry would be pleased. Mark looked up and felt the blood drain from his face. Why had he just had that thought? Where did that even come from? On the TV was the same view from the bridge he'd had earlier that afternoon. As the camera looked over the highway, first Mark saw the wrecks intermingled with police cars, emergency vehicles, and tow trucks. Then behind that there were three lanes of backed up traffic, waiting for the highway to reopen. The TV crew must have shot it from up on the bridge.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER III- Henry's Game Now the scene on the TV switched from day to night, and a woman with red hair stepped in front of the camera. She was holding the microphone and trying to brush the falling snow off her shoulders as she talked. At the rate the snow was beginning to fall, she wasn't having much success. In the background, headlights flashed past and disappeared under the bridge. \"And that was the way it was for several hours this afternoon,\" she was saying. \"As you can see now, things are moving again. But traffic was backed up for four miles on the northbound side. Even after the cars blocking the route were cleared, traffic continued to move slowly for several hours while police and tow-truck operators cleared debris from the road.\" The scene now jumped back to the news studio, and a gray-haired man sitting at a news desk was turned toward a TV monitor, where Mark could see the red-haired woman still standing at the bridge. \"Now you say, Monica, that no one was hurt,\" the gray-haired man said. \"That's right, Jim,\" said the red-haired woman. \"Ambulances were sent to the scene, but they weren't needed. Several law-enforcement officials on the scene have told me it was a miracle no one was injured.\" Mark felt the knot in his stomach tighten again. He had to leave. He couldn't sit here listening to this. It was bad enough what had happened today, and no small amount of confusing as well- Mark didn't need to be reminded of it. He had to pause before getting up- Mark was feeling more than a little tense all of a sudden, and if he burst from his chair like a coiled spring he'd bring unneeded attention to himself. Mark stood up and cast a glance over at Susan by the window- she happened to be looking his way, too, and perhaps sensed some part of the turmoil within Mark. \"Are you all right, Mark?\" For a second Mark just stared back at her. He was on the verge of saying something, some part of what had happened today and how it was bothering him… \"Is something wrong?\" Susan asked. Silently, Mark willed himself to be calm. He had to be, at least right now. He couldn't tell her. Not Susan. And again, what was he even going to say? Mark calmed himself with that thought, with the simple knowledge that he needed to think this through and make a decision before he went to anybody. Otherwise he'd just get both himself and Henry in trouble. And he needed Henry's friendship. No matter who Henry might really be, Mark couldn't just turn on him now. \"No, everything's fine.\" Mark even added a little smile, which calmed Susan in turn. \"Good night, Mark.\" She said, and after Mark echoed the sentiment, she soon returned her attention to Connie and watching the snow fall outside. With a panel of glass in between, its flawless, beautiful surface hid the merciless cold it really held. Mark walked out of the kitchen and down the hall towards Wallace's study. Henry's father had said something about doing a little work after dinner. Now, through the half-open study door, Mark could see Wallace's back as he sat at his desk. Mark slowly walked down the hall toward him. That crazy urge to tell someone was returning again, getting stronger every inch he stepped forward. He was trying to collect his thoughts- and not having too easy a time of it. But maybe he should say something. And if he was to tell anyone, Wallace was the person. Wallace was… in charge. He was the father, the boss. No matter what, he'd know what to do. As Mark stepped down the hall, he passed an open doorway to his right. Inside it was dark. Suddenly, a whisper sprang out: \"Go ahead. Tell him.\" Mark jumped. His heart began to race. A moment later Henry appeared out of the dark. Henry moved closer, a smile playing across his lips. He was looking smug, especially pleased with himself. Mark felt his throat grow tight. \"Better yet,\" his cousin whispered, \"why don't we tell him together?\" \"Drop dead,\" Mark whispered back, throwing a nervous glance down the hall. Through the doorway he could see Wallace was still hunched over his desk, unaware of the conversation taking place in the hallway behind him. \"Are you sure you really want that?\" Henry whispered, that smile still on his face. Then his voice took on an innocent tone, as if he was speaking to his father, perhaps as a ghost. \"It's too bad for Mark, Dad,\" he said. \"He wished me dead and my heart just stopped, the very day I told him he'd passed the last of my tests. The day before I was gonna do it. Show him something amazing, something he'd never forget… and now he'll never know what it was.\" Henry gazed at him in the dark, and asked, \"Is that what you want?\" Mark just stared at Henry. He didn't know what to say. \"Nothing happened today, Mark. A few cars got banged up,\" Henry said, speaking Mark's exact thoughts from earlier in the evening. That alone jolted Mark, though it couldn't have been anything but coincidence. \"Why feel so guilty, Mark? Why be scared all the time?\" Henry put this two-pronged question to Mark, his face now serious, and walked- seemed to glide, so smooth and calm was his pace- down the hall, then up the stairs to his room. Mark couldn't remember later how long he stood in the hallway by himself. All he did remember was that he was there for at least fifteen minutes, and at one point even stood right outside Wallace's office, hand balled into a fist and raised to knock on the door. But ultimately Mark let his hand fall, and headed for the stairs without a word. Henry was lying on his bed when Mark arrived, holding an expensive-looking model of a submarine in his hands as he stared up at it- or the ceiling. Henry stayed where he was as Mark came in, but greeted him with, \"You know, you've been acting a little weird lately, Mark. Before you got here Dad told me to make sure you were doing okay.\" Now he cast a glance at his cousin. \"Well, are you okay, Mark?\" Mark said nothing as he sat down on his own bed, and also rolled on his back to look up at the ceiling. Henry made a sound of mock disappointment. \"Aw, Mr. Guilty Conscience.\" But Mark said nothing- neither angry nor pleased with Henry, he was trying to figure out what his next move would be. Henry seemed to be content to leave him be- or perhaps lost interest and resumed looking at the model submarine. After a few minutes of silence Mark heard Connie's light, energetic feet bouncing up the stairs. Sure enough, she appeared in the doorway a moment later, her face the very picture of childish excitement. \"Hey, hey! Guess what? Mom says we can go skating tomorrow!\" In her enthusiasm, Connie stepped through the doorway and into the room. Henry, paying no attention to Connie before, suddenly looked at her sharply and set down the model. Mark looked at him as Henry got up, and saw a very cold and hateful look come onto his face. He walked over to his sister, glowering over her. \"Connie, what did I tell you about coming into my room?\" His sister looked puzzled. \"But you guys aren't working or anything.\" Now Henry grabbed her ears and yanked hard, cocking his head to the side in annoyance. \"Ow, that hurts!\" Connie yelped. \"You didn't answer my question, so I'm gonna have to do it for you!\" Henry hissed angrily. \"Ow, let go!\" \"You're not allowed to come into my room! Not now, not ever! Never !\" Mark suddenly stood up. This was too much. He crossed the room quickly, reaching out for Henry as he shook his sister furiously, ignoring the tears of pain streaking her face. \"Did you hear what I-\" Henry was saying when Mark grabbed him by the throat and slammed him against the closet door. Henry mustered only a surprised \"Urk\" while Connie ran from the room. \"Mom! Mom! They're fighting!\" she cried, fleeing downstairs. \"You shouldn't do that to her- she's your sister!\" Mark hissed. Henry forced his hands under Mark's grip, relaxing his throat. \"Who cares?\" he hissed back. \"All she does is take my parents' attention away from me!\" Henry's voice became very angry now, the fury rising in his eyes. \"And I was born first!\" Mark now shook Henry in anger where he had just done the same to his sister. \"Then try being a good son for once! A good brother! They'll love you for that and so will she!\" the words were out of Mark's mouth before even he fully understood them. But while Mark might have been uncertain as to the meaning of his own words, they certainly had an effect on Henry. Henry's fury faded, and in its place an eerie calm appeared. A small but very unpleasant smile crept onto Henry's lips. It was the look of a challenge accepted. \"You're smart, Mark.\" Henry said quietly. \"I like you.\" Then, before Mark could say anything, Henry's shot up and grabbed to handfuls of Mark's hair. Sharp, sudden pain lanced through Mark's head. \"Ow!\" he cried. \"What are you doing?\" Henry grinned fiendishly. He chuckled, a sound that was suddenly very frightening the way Henry did it. \"Connie thinks we're fighting. So let's fight, Mark. Come on, you don't want my Mom to think Connie lied, do you?\" Mark was still pretty angry with Henry, so he found it easy enough to oblige. He grabbed to handfuls of Henry's fine blonde hair and pulled. Soon both had their eyes locked close together, engaged in a fierce mock battle where neither was willing to give in to the pain. \"How's this look? Good enough?\" Mark grunted as Henry gave his hair a sharp jerk. Henry chuckled again. \"Yeah. Pretty good.\" Footsteps coming up the stairs; right away Henry knew it was his mother. \"Just play along,\" he whispered with a wink. \"I do this stuff all the time.\" \"Boys, boys!\" Susan cried, astonished at seeing the two- apparently- in some kind of fight. They immediately broke apart and faced her. Casting a glance at Henry, Mark was astonished again at how quickly his cousin could shift from one expression, projecting one image, to entirely another. One minute he was gloating, hidden-mastermind Henry- this one he was slightly cowed, apologetic Henry, projecting the very picture of sheepish, boyish regret. \"I'm sorry, Mom,\" Henry said, glancing down at the floor then back up at his mother. \"We were playing this really dumb game. We weren't fighting, though. Honest.\" He looked at his cousin for confirmation. \"Right, Mark?\" Mark realised he was supposed to play along… but… this all felt very strange to him. Deceiving people was clearly nothing new to Henry. Mark knew nothing about it at all. A strange feeling of fear ran through him. What if Mark tried to imitate his cousin and failed? What if Susan just saw right through the façade? Henry briefly locked eyes with his cousin. Play along, his eyes said. Play along and I'll take care of it. Finally, Mark went ahead. \"Yeah… yeah. We were just playing.\" He said quietly. For a moment- just a moment, only- it looked like Susan wanted to question them, ask if something funny had gone on between them today. But if that thought occurred to Susan, she didn't pay much attention to it. Instead, the look past and she smiled in relief. \"Well, all right.\" She said, adding, \"Just don't play so rough, okay? You two looked like you were trying to kill each other.\" She then turned and headed back down the stairs. Why didn't Susan say anything about Connie- about how mean Henry had just been to her? Mark found himself staring after his aunt in astonishment. Was Henry really that good? Mark broke out of his reverie to find Henry staring at him, smiling that wolfish grin of his that looked a little out of place on a twelve-year-old boy. He skipped lightly across the room and flopped down on his bed, leaning up against the pillows and staring back at Mark, still grinning. \"Impressed?\" he asked.[Chapter 4] CHAPTER IV- Nighttime in Henry's Room Mark walked slowly over to his bed, sitting down on it on the other side of the room. \"I don't know.\" Henry laughed, and to Mark it sounded… odd. A little colder than it should have been. It was like hearing icicles imitate flawlessly the laugh of a twelve-year-old boy, chiming the sound out perfectly as they swayed in the frigid wind. \"You don't know ?\" Henry repeated, a slight tone of mocking in his voice. \"Come on, Mark. This is my room. Real thinking gets done here.\" Mark looked up at his cousin. \"It's my room. Your mom said I can stay.\" The blonde kid sitting on the opposite bed smiled indulgently at his cousin. \"Yes, she did. You can stay here all you want, Mark. It's nice, not having to put up with just my kid sister anymore.\" Henry sighed a little. \"It just hasn't been the same since we lost Richard.\" Mark started. This was eerie; this was the second time Henry had talked about his younger brother, dead years ago from drowning in the bathtub. He sounded wistful, a little sad about it, but the regret sounded… forced. Like Henry was having to fake it. Henry had been staring up at the ceiling for a time while Mark thought to himself, but now he turned his gaze back to his cousin. \"You like my sister, don't you?\" Henry said, that wolfish grin returning. \"Yeah.\" Mark said simply, unsure of what Henry was getting at with this. \"Well, you'd be sad if something happened to her, right? If she got… hurt.\" Hurt? Henry shrugged, a little you-know-how-it-is expression, and went on, \"But hey, accidents happen. I know about Richard- I found him.\" Now that mean, predatory look on Henry's face was present in full. The harmless, boyish smile wasn't there anymore. \"But if you really want a good story sometime… you should ask my mom about Richard.\" Mark suddenly felt very cold. His unease must have shown throughout the evening, because Henry seemed to sense he'd perhaps gone too far, and spent much of the remaining hours before- and after- bedtime assuring Mark everything was fine, and that he hadn't done the wrong thing. He also asked about something Mark had said earlier that night. \"Mark…\" Henry's voice drifted over to him in the darkness. \"Yeah?\" Mark responded, halfway wishing his cousin would just go to bed and leave him alone. He still had way too much to think about. \"You really do like my sister, don't you?\" That question again. Mark finally decided he had to say something, and responded, \"Yes, I do. She's nice to me.\" \"Aren't I , too?\" Now Henry's whisper sounded a bit envious. That feeling- envy- came out very easily in Henry, it seemed. Mark shrugged, despite the fact that Henry probably couldn't see him in the dark. This was incorrect, as it happened- had an optician been present, one who had truly achieved expertise in dealing with the eyes of children, he'd have likely been astonished at how good Henry's sight in the dark really was. And in the light. If Henry ever bragged he could see everything, he'd have been closer to telling the truth than most. Mark answered his cousin, \"Yeah. Most of the time. Connie's just nice to everybody, though.\" \"Except me.\" Henry spat. \"Bratty little kid sister.\" \"Maybe if you were nicer to her,\" Mark suggested, \"Maybe if you weren't always so mean…\" Henry laughed a little, genuinely amused. \"You've never seen me get mean, Mark.\" Mark stopped briefly, glancing over at his cousin. Henry's smile was there in the dark, yes, but it didn't touch his eyes. He meant it. Mark decided to turn his gaze back to the ceiling- staring at Henry for too long gave him a weird feeling. It wasn't something he felt looking at friends of his back in Arizona, like Alan Parks. Henry almost seemed to be… Missing something? Mark shrugged a little, if only to himself. Maybe he was just imagining things. He decided to continue what he was saying to Henry. Maybe his cousin would hear him out, consider his suggestions. In spite of all the strange and sometimes mean things he would say and do, Henry seemed to genuinely like Mark. \"You shouldn't be so mean to Connie all the time, Henry. That's all I'm saying.\" \"And what should I do instead?\" Mark shrugged again. \"Be nice to her sometime.\" Henry looked back at the ceiling. \"Be nice to her… be nice to Connie…\" Mark glanced over at the blonde. He couldn't quite figure what his cousin's tone was this time. Was he taking Mark seriously, or just pretending to? With Henry, it could be almost impossible to tell. Henry shrugged a little, and as he said \"Maybe I will sometime, Mark,\" Mark noticed something odd- when Henry had shrugged that time, his bare shoulders had appeared above the covers. They were in a warm house, sure, but it was the middle of a freezing Maine winter and Henry's bed was right next to a window. How could he possibly sleep with his shirt off? And why? Even for Henry that was strange. Mark decided to ask him about it. Henry laughed again, glancing over at his cousin, amused. He sat up a bit to confirm Mark's observation- his shoulders, chest, and middle were indeed completely bare. \"It's my hot Yankee blood,\" Henry explained. \"I sleep like this to keep from getting too warm.\" Then Henry got a funny look in his eye and said, \"I'm actually naked, Mark. Wanna see?\" That was too much for Mark. \"Eww, gross !\" he exclaimed, too loud for so late at night. Even so, both of them broke up laughing. Mark found himself laughing halfway out of simple relief; somehow, Henry telling Mark something as ridiculous as that had made them both feel at ease again. Mark went to sleep a short time later, dropping off much more easily than he'd expected. As for Henry, though, he simply lay on his back, hands folded behind his head, for at least an hour after he watched his cousin go to sleep. He was indeed undressed- his clothes lay at the end of the bed, folded with obsessive neatness. He'd undressed when Mark had left to brush his teeth- Henry had already done that- and was already under the covers when Mark returned. Henry did this almost every night, and he'd never been able to explain why. It just… felt good . Henry gazed up at the ceiling in the dark. Had Mark been awake to watch, he might have felt real fear for the first time that day. As Henry stared at the white ceiling, a sunken, rather horrible grin slowly worked its way onto his face. Everything had gone very well so far, all things considered. Sure, Mark had pushed back at times, resisted quite strongly at others. But slowly… very slowly… he was coming around to Henry's way of thinking. Henry could already tell. It was going to take a long time for Mark to make the whole trip- Henry was as sure of that as anything. But… as long as he got there eventually… Henry began to laugh silently in the dark. This was going to be amazing. The most fun he'd ever had was just waiting out there for him, in those two weeks he had left to spend with his cousin. Henry looked forward to sending a very… different… Mark back to Arizona with Uncle Jack. It was going to be fun to see that, indeed.[Chapter 5] Chapter V- Walk in the Park Bright sunlight was streaming through the curtains when Mark awoke the next morning. Immediately he glanced at Henry's bed. The bed was empty, and Mark wondered how much earlier than him Henry had gotten up, or where he'd gone. They'd both stayed up for a long time last night, but obviously Henry hadn't had any difficulty in getting up bright and early the next day. A brief feeling of irritation ran through Mark; he knew Henry was adventurous and often liked to be alone, but he wished Henry would stop leaving him out of things. If they were supposed to be friends Henry needed to act like it more. And stop doing awful things and then making Mark part of them. Mark got up and went to the window. He had to squint in the bright light. Outside, the sun was shining, and its light was reflected off the thick blanket of newly-fallen snow. Mark stared, fascinated and amazed. He'd never seen so much snow in his life. It covered every inch of ground, as well as every bush and tree. For a moment, Mark forgot about all his other concerns and worries; he just wanted to go outside and jump in the stuff. He wanted to do all the things he'd heard of but had never been able to do, like make snowmen and snow angels and have snowball fights. Then Mark glanced again at Henry's empty, unmade bed. Briefly, a deep feeling of unease ran through him. Maybe he wouldn't have time to play today; it was possible Mark would need to look towards more pressing concerns. Like what?, his mind asked. Mark had a hard time answering that. Finally, he shrugged to himself, and headed for the bathroom to dress. He could figure out what he was gonna do once he learned where Henry had gone, or once Henry got back. After a moment, Mark reconsidered. He didn't have to wait on Henry, did he? If his cousin wanted to get up before Mark and go do something without waking him, maybe Henry wanted to be alone for the time being. In any case, now might be a good time for Mark to spend some time on his own. That seemed like a good idea; there was a lot of thinking he needed to do. Henry seemed interested, even eager, in being friends with Mark… but he had a very bizarre idea of fun, and almost seemed to want Mark to start finding those things fun, too. Mark felt very alone in the world right now, and he knew he couldn't turn away someone offering to be his friend. But Henry wasn't like most people. Yes, that decided Mark. He'd find something else to do for now; he could concern himself with whatever Henry was doing later. Mark dressed quickly and hurried downstairs. He could somehow sense that Henry was not only out of his room but out of the house. It was weird how the house felt different when Henry wasn't there. It was as if his presence made the air heavier, darkened the shadows and made the light places seem weaker. When Henry wasn't there, the house felt warmer, lighter, and brighter. Maybe that was saying too much… maybe it was just Mark's imagination. But Henry did have an imposing presence; knowing him was not a simple experience, not when you realised he wasn't the simple, well-mannered boy he appeared to be. Mark went into the kitchen. Susan was standing by the sink, doing the dishes. It looked as if breakfast was finished. \"Where's Connie?\" Mark asked. Susan turned from the sink and gave him a funny look. \"She was here a moment ago. Why?\" \"She didn't go out, did she?\" Mark asked. \"No, I don't think so. Is something wrong?\" Mark paused to consider that. Was there? Finally, he shook his head. \"No. Nothing.\" Mark yawned, stretching a little. He wasn't fully awake yet, it seemed. \"No,\" he added, \"I was just wondering where Connie was.\" Susan frowned. \"You look tired.\" Mark shrugged; he had been up late talking with Henry last night- as well as thinking, over and over, about the blonde boy who was offering to be his friend, albeit a very unusual one. But he wasn't about to tell Susan much of this; she'd probably have questions Mark didn't want to answer. \"Hungry?\" Susan asked. Mark nodded, glancing around him. \"Have you seen Henry?\" Susan nodded. \"He went out about an hour ago; he was on another of his secret missions. I'm sure he just wanted to let you sleep in; Henry seems very glad you're here.\" Mark nodded, smiling a little; that much was certainly true, regardless of how much else was or wasn't. \"Yeah,\" Mark said, \"he does.\" Susan smiled at that. \"So,\" she asked, \"what would you like for breakfast?\" \"Oh, anything you've got,\" Mark said. He walked over to the doorway to the living room and looked through it, hoping he'd see Connie there. She wasn't. \"Looking for something?\" Susan asked. \"Uh, not really,\" Mark said, feeling somehow uneasy. He headed back in to the kitchen, sitting down at the table. If Connie was still in the house, he'd hear the door slam when she went out. That was that; no sense worrying about it. \"How about scrambled eggs and toast?\" Susan asked. \"Sounds great,\" Mark said, smiling. Susan's cooking was quite good, just like… just like his mother's. Mark's smile faded a little. He didn't like thinking about his mother right now; it was all much too saddening. He'd have to work things out sometime, though. Sometime… but maybe not this morning. Mark sat at the table, getting about as comfortable as he could on the hard wooden chair. He was still on edge, though- what if Connie had gone outside? What if Henry had been out there, waiting for her? And then, on the heels of those two questions, a third- And why should that matter ? Mark wasn't sure why. He couldn't answer that. He just knew Henry was scary sometimes… killing that dog had clearly meant nothing to Henry. He'd even found it funny. And the same went for throwing that dummy off the bridge, all the trouble doing that had caused all those people. Henry didn't care; he just didn't. Maybe he'd never learned how… or had never been able. That was a very strange thing to think about. And frightening. If any other kid in the world had implied that he was going to do something bad to his little sister, Mark would have ignored it. But not Henry. True, Henry had listened when Mark had argued with him, and they'd patched things up last night… mostly. But even so, the fact remained that Mark was very ill at ease about Henry. Best to keep on alert until he'd made up his mind about his cousin. The kitchen door swung open and Connie came in, dressed in a pink snowsuit, white boots, and mittens. \"You got dressed all by yourself!\" Susan said, delight in her voice. Connie nodded and beamed proudly. \"Well, you're becoming my big little girl,\" Susan said. \"Can I go out and play in the snow?\" Connie asked. \"Of course you can,\" Susan said. \"Go right ahead.\" Connie turned to leave; Mark called after her. \"Hey, wait!\" Connie stopped, looking confused. \"What?\" \"How'd you like to play with me?\" Mark asked. \"Uh, okay.\" Connie grinned shyly. \"I'm going to the playground. I'll see you there.\" \"No,\" Mark said, quicker than he'd meant to. Connie scowled. \"What is it, Mark?\" Susan asked over the sound of the raw eggs sizzling on a hot skillet. Mark looked at his aunt, trying to be as casual as he could. \"Well, I was wondering if Connie would wait for me, that's all.\" \"Why can't she go ahead?\" Susan asked. \"Well, uh…\" Mark had to think fast. \"I don't really know how to get to the playground.\" \"It's easy,\" Connie said. \"You just go down the driveway and make a left, and you'll see it.\" \"Well, I'd still like to walk there with you,\" Mark said. \"I mean, I won't be too long. I just need to eat breakfast and throw on my boots and a warm jacket.\" Susan gave her nephew another funny look, then turned to Connie. \"Would you be all right waiting, Connie?\" she asked. Connie pouted. \"But I'm getting hot,\" she said. \"You could go play outside until I'm ready,\" Mark suggested. Connie smiled warmly at Mark. \"Okay,\" she said, \"I'll see you outside.\" \"Great,\" Susan said. Mark waved at her and then glanced back at Susan, hoping the whole scene hadn't appeared too strange. Susan looked back at him. She cocked her head slightly to the side, puzzled. \"What is it, Mark?\" she asked. Mark shrugged. \"Nothing, really. I just feel like I spend a lot of time with Henry, and Connie gets ignored a little much. I thought she'd like it if I spent some time with her, too.\" Susan smiled. \"That's very sweet of you.\" After breakfast, Mark put on some boots and a warm jacket, then went outside. Connie was lying on her back in the snow, making snow angels. Mark marveled as he stepped into the snow and his foot sank ten inches. What amazing stuff , he thought. Never seen it before at all, let alone this much of it . \"Ready?\" Connie asked, getting up. \"Sure,\" Mark said. They started down the driveway and out into the road. The road had been plowed, but it was still quite narrow. A large, long mound of piled-up, plowed snow lined either side of the road. There wasn't much room for two cars to pass; that meant precious little room left for pedestrians. Thinking about this, Mark asked, \"What happens if a car comes?\" \"We do this.\" Connie scrambled over one of the mounds of snow; in just a few seconds' time, she was safely out of the way. \"Okay, gotcha,\" Mark smiled. They continued down the road until the playground came into view. It had never occurred to Mark that kids would want to play in a playground after it had snowed, but here they were. Mark could see kids everywhere; on the swings and monkey bars, throwing snowballs and generally just enjoying themselves. Mark looked around the playground- Henry was not to be seen.[Chapter 6] Chapter VI- Alice Davenport Connie played in the playground all morning. After a while, a bunch of her friends showed up, and the sunny winter air warmed with their laughter. The current game was to build a snowman near the swings, then get on the swing and see if you could swing close enough to kick his head off. Not far away, Mark sat on a bench and watched. The sun shone down, warming Mark as he sat guard duty. He was tired and his eyes felt scratchy; it was like there were tiny grains of sand behind his eyelids. I definitely should have gone to bed earlier last night, Mark thought as he yawned. He wished he could take a nap, but this Maine cold took some real getting used to. He kept having the odd yet recurring thought that he might freeze and die if he fell asleep out here. It didn't seem to happen much to people from Maine, but that's probably because they knew better than to be caught unawares. Mark didn't have that, being from Arizona. And there was still Henry's threat the night before- he was not a boy to be trifled with, friend or no friend. Mark wasn't going to let Connie out of his sight just yet. He was so intent on watching her that he didn't notice Alice Davenport's approach until she was practically right in front of the bench. \"Hello, Mark.\" Mark looked up, surprised. Alice was wearing a large navy-blue parka and white earmuffs. He suddenly remembered that at his last appointment he'd agreed to meet with her again. \"Susan said you'd be here,\" Davenport said. \"I guess you forgot about our appointment.\" Mark looked away, feeling a little guilt and a lot of unease. He didn't like this. She'd actually come and found him! What was she going to do now- try to have a session right here in the playground? \"Did you forget?\" Davenport asked. In a way, Mark had forgotten. But there were reasons for it; for one, he'd been focused more on keeping watch over Connie. And there was at least one other reason. \"Maybe I just didn't feel like talking,\" Mark said. \"May I join you?\" Davenport asked. Mark looked up, not managing to conceal how surprised he was. The truth was he didn't want her to join him, but knew it would be rude to say so. Davenport swept some snow off the bench and sat down. Mark stared out at the playground; he could tell Davenport was still looking at him. \"Talking helps, Mark,\" she said. \"It helped last time, didn't it?\" Last time, Mark thought, was a while ago, and not just in passed time. A lot had happened since then; Henry was no ordinary kid, and Mark was all kinds of confused about what to do about it. It was so weird. Henry had shown again and again that he liked doing terrible things. He was mean, and it rarely had anything to do with someone having actually wronged him. All that was needed was a perceived wrong; a sense on Henry's part of having been slighted. But Henry did seem serious when he'd offered Mark his friendship. And he'd struck a chord in Mark at the strangest moment possible. Out there by the road, with the chaos left by Mr. Highway behind them amidst the falling snow, Henry had asked Mark if he'd felt helpless when his mother died. Mark had, and admitted as much to Henry. There'd been something else, though; something that was difficult to place. Mark hadn't been comfortable mentioning it to his cousin then… but when his mother had died, Mark hadn't just been sad, though the memory of that sadness hurt still. Somewhere, deeper inside than even the sadness went, Mark had been furious. Furious with himself for failing to save his mother, furious at the doctors for not being able to save her. Furious at the simple fact that his mother had fallen ill and died, and there hadn't been a damn thing Mark could do about it. Mark had been astounded when Henry guessed so close to the Mark; he'd even asked if Mark had felt powerless. Henry had gotten so close to the truth it was scary. There was so much on Mark's mind; and so much of it, he could not talk about. Or could he? Mark turned and looked at Davenport. \"You're a doctor,\" he said slowly. \"You know things.\" \"Well, some things,\" she said. \"I can't do brain surgery.\" \"But you know about people,\" Mark said. \"Let's suffice it to say that it's an area I'm more comfortable with,\" Davenport allowed. \"Do you think it's evil to want power?\" Davenport looked surprised for a moment, then puzzled. \"What do you mean by that, Mark?\" Mark frowned, trying to figure out how best to phrase the question. He wasn't even sure what words he was looking for; he knew what he wanted to say, but the words weren't coming. \"I mean when someone does things on purpose, things that hurt other people. But it meant he was in charge. Is that evil?\" Davenport then said something that surprised Mark. \"Evil's a word I don't have much time for.\" Mark looked at her. \"What do you mean?\" \"I believe it's what people say when they've given up trying to understand someone,\" Davenport said. \"There's a reason for everything, Mark. That includes people's behavior- certainly, wanting to have power over things, to be in charge just like you said. Any time someone wants that- wants anything- there's a reason. Unfortunately, the reason can be hard to find sometimes.\" \"But what if there isn't a reason?\" Mark insisted. \"What if something just is ?\" \"You asked me if wanting power was evil, and I said there's a reason anytime someone wants that. But it would seem to me that if something just is, then it must have always been that way,\" Davenport said. \"You see? If it happens, then there's a cause. But if it simply exists, then it has to exist from the start. Let me ask you a question, Mark- do you believe someone can be born evil?\" Mark wasn't certain; it didn't seem like that was possible. He couldn't think of anything Wallace or Susan would have done that would have made Henry anything you could call evil. And what was evil, really? Mark was having doubts about that, too. Maybe Henry just naturally saw the world a different way. He shook his head, confused. Davenport was watching him again. \"I have another question,\" Davenport said. \"Do you think you're evil? Because you let your mother die? Do you think it makes you evil to wish you could have had the power to prevent it?\" Mark sighed, staring out at the playground. There were a bunch of perfectly normal, definitely-not-evil-by-any-definition kids playing tag in the snow. Mark was very confused about things right now, and it was only made more so by the fact that he wasn't really talking about himself. How could he explain that? \"It's not true, Davenport said gently. \"You didn't let your mother die, and every boy would want to be able to save his mother. Neither of those things is wrong, Mark. You're not evil.\" Mark sighed; this was only somewhat helpful. In many ways, it was just raising more questions than it answered. \"Okay,\" Mark said, \"but wait. Just listen for a second. What if there was this boy?\" \"A boy about your age?\" Davenport asked. Mark nodded. \"Suppose he did these terrible things… because he wanted to be in charge of things, all the time. And because he liked doing them. Would you say he was evil?\" Davenport gazed off into the bright blue, cloudless sky for a few moments, then shook her head. \"I'm sorry, Mark,\" she said, \"but I simply do not believe in evil.\" Mark had lost patience; this wasn't getting him anywhere. He might be just as well off talking to Henry- at least Henry was his own age. And Henry was offering him something, not making some strange effort to 'understand' him. Mark got up and faced Davenport. \"So you don't believe in evil?\" Alice Davenport shook her head. Mark tried one more time. \"Not even if someone wants to never, ever be powerless again? That wouldn't make someone evil?\" Davenport shook her head a second time. \"Well… maybe you should,\" Mark said. Before Davenport could reply, he jogged off through the snow toward Connie. \"Hey, Connie,\" he shouted. \"It's lunchtime. Come on, we better go.\" As Connie pouted and Mark made his way over to get her to join him, he glanced out of the corner of his eye toward Alice Davenport. She was still sitting on the bench, watching him with a concerned look on her face. Unknown to either of them, a slim, blonde-haired boy was crouched on a snowy hill in the woods nearby. He'd been there for close to an hour, pausing at one point to smoke a cigarette. Other than that, he hadn't moved so much as once; it was his eyes, only his eyes, that had shifted on occasion. The boy smiled; sound carried remarkably well in the snow. In his tan winter jacket and white pants, he was nearly invisible at a distance- his choice of colour in winter clothing this morning was no coincidence for that very reason. As Mark finally got Connie and left, and Alice Davenport eventually got up and left the park, the blonde boy stared after them, watching all three people with coldly appraising eyes. When Mark got home, the phone was ringing. Mark hurried into the living room and picked up the wireless handset on the end table. \"Hello?\" For a split second, all he heard was distant static. Then a faraway voice said, \"Hello? Wallace?\" \"Dad!\" Mark exclaimed, recognizing the voice now. The line must be very distant indeed; his voice hardly resembled Uncle Wallace's. But Mark didn't care; he hadn't heard from his dad since he'd last seen him, when they'd said goodbye out in the driveway of Wallace and Susan's house. This was the best thing he'd happen all day. \"Mark!\" Jack Evans sounded just as delighted to hear from his son as Mark was to hear from him. \"I'm calling from Hong Kong.\" \"Great, Dad. How's everything going?\" Mark could almost see his dad shrug. \"Ah, it's going. You don't fly to the other side of the world to work on a simple business deal. I've been running around like mad; these guys in Hong Kong think there's forty-eight hours in the day. But, I wanted to call and say hello to everyone. You having a good time there?\" Mark had to think about that one a second. Was he? Well, his aunt and uncle were great, and so was Connie. They were all being so nice to him, so welcoming. Even Henry was, albeit in his own way... a way that was unlike anyone else Mark had ever met. Mark's stomach lurched when he thought again of the bridge, of Mr. Highway… and of Henry raising his arms and shouting joyously above the scream of tires and the crash of shattering glass. \"Mark?\" Mark started; he'd almost forgotten he was still on the phone. Well, there was no way he was gonna be able to explain what Henry was up to, and even then Mark wasn't sure he wanted to. Henry seemed sure he had something to offer Mark, as bizarre as that seemed. What if Mark tried to rat Henry out, and then Henry turned out to be right? What if? Finally, Mark made up his mind. He was having a good time, he decided; and Henry he would deal with soon enough. If the two ultimately couldn't get along, Mark would let his dad know. But for now he'd keep certain things between himself and his cousin. Making sure to put the smile into his voice, Mark said, \"Yeah! Everything's going great over here, Dad.\" \"Having any fun?\" \"Lots of fun,\" Mark replied, and he could almost see his father smile. \"Glad to hear it,\" Jack said. \"So, you like it there?\" \"Sure do,\" Mark said, forgetting his father couldn't see him nod. Connie, fighting in the hallway with her snowsuit, fell over. \"Darn!\" she said, about the fiercest swear word she knew. Looking through the square panes of glass in the living room windows, Mark saw Henry coming up the front drive, bounding onto the porch. He was wearing black leather gloves, a tan felt jacket and white pants… all of which looked very expensive. Mark wondered briefly what kind of salary Henry's dad made in a year; whatever it was, it wasn't a small number. \"That's great, Mark. That's really great.\" Jack sounded very pleased, and he was. What better relief was there than knowing he had, indeed, left his son in good hands? Then Jack unknowingly asked the tough question: \"You and Henry getting along?\" Mark answered that one just as Henry started to come in the door. He said simply, \"Yeah, we are. Everybody's been really nice to me here. Been having a good time.\" \"Great, Mark, I'm glad to hear that. Is Henry around, by the way? If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to say hi to him while I'm calling.\" Mark glanced into the entrance hallway; Henry, standing behind Connie as she fought with one of her boots, was grinning and holding up a pack of cigarettes. See why I was late? The look said. Mark waved back and made a cutting motion with his eyes, looking at Connie. Henry shrugged and pocketed the pack of cigarettes, stopping to help Connie get her boots off. Mark stared, again briefly forgetting his dad was on the line. Never had he seen Henry do that before. Henry looked up and met his eyes, grinning impishly again. He seemed to have completely anticipated Mark's surprise. \"Yeah,\" Mark finally managed to say, \"Henry just got back, actually. You wanna talk to him now?\" \"Sure, Mark, if that's all right.\" \"Yeah, Dad,\" Mark said, \"No problem. Great to hear from you.\" \"Good to know you're doing great out there, Mark. I'll be back soon.\" Henry took the phone a few moments later; he spoke with Jack only briefly, but was as polite and friendly as ever. He more or less echoed Mark's comments, and did seem genuinely pleased to tell Jack he and Mark were getting along. After hanging up, Henry joined his cousin in helping Connie out of her snowsuit. Once Connie had been extracted from the fluffy pink mess and had happily bounded off to watch TV for a while, Mark turned to Henry, a look of shock on his face. \"What was that?\" Mark asked, amazed. Henry stared back with a smirk on his face, looking so smug it was ridiculous. \"I'm being nice to my sister, Mark. Wasn't that your idea?\" Then he reached into his pocket, holding up the pack of cigarettes again. \"How 'bout it, Mark?\" Mark hesitated; he wasn't quite sure what to say. \"My parents went out to do some grocery shopping; they'll be back in a little while,\" Henry said, somehow anticipating Mark's very question. \"There's time.\" Mark glanced back towards the TV room; in Wallace and Susan's house, there seemed enough rooms to set aside one for everything. One of the top-floor bedrooms was even being converted into a library. But Mark's mind wasn't on Wallace's project for the house; it was on Connie, and leaving her alone if he went out. Henry seemed to pose no threat to her, certainly not now… but they'd still be leaving a little girl alone in an awfully big house. \"What about Connie?\" Mark asked. Henry looked at his cousin pityingly. \"Always worrying, Mark. You're always worrying .\" Mark was close to giving in. He didn't want to seem like some kind of killjoy, and Henry did seem to have taken his advice, even if only in a small way. Once Henry mentioned that Connie's favourite show, \"Parks' Town\", would be on for the next half-hour, Mark relented. \"Connie!\" Henry called as they headed for the back door, \"We're going outside; be back in a few minutes!\" \"Okay!\" Connie chirped, hardly listening. Reaching for the brass handle of the door to the back porch, Henry looked at Mark and smiled. \"See?\" he said quietly, \"Nothing to worry about.\" Mark just shrugged, almost reluctant to admit Henry had been so accurate. Henry just smiled, as if he'd expected that too. Out on the back porch, Henry wasted no time. He plopped down on the wood deck, letting his feet hang over the solid foot of snow covering the garden that would be there come spring. Henry then pulled out his lighter and cigarettes, casually holding one out for Mark as he lit up his own. \"Man,\" Mark said, \"if your parents find us out here, they're gonna kill us.\" \"So what?\" Henry shrugged, unconcerned. \"Dying's just another thing, we all do it. No big deal.\" But when Henry saw the concerned look on Mark's face, he sighed. \"I've done this before, Mark,\" he said, a little impatiently. \"It'll be fine .\" Finally, Mark took the cigarette. Trying to affect Henry's casual manner, he calmly placed the cigarette between his lips and leaned over when Henry held up the lighter. \"Just take a drag, nice and easy,\" Henry said. \"And don't gag.\" Henry remembered, then, Mark's thoroughly graceless coughing fit from last time. Mark winced a little; he remembered that, too. But he did as Henry suggested, and though the smoke still burned at him and made him want to cough, Mark kept it down to a few light coughs this time. He smiled a little, in spite of himself- progress. For most of that half-hour Connie's show was on, the two boys sat on the back porch, smoking their cigarettes and talking quietly. It amazed Mark they were still able to do this, after all that had happened. Mark felt a little thrill at defying the rules like this; smoking a cigarette was kind of exciting, if only because you weren't allowed to at his and Henry's age. And this was a kind of rebellious fun Mark could almost appreciate; it was a world apart from tossing Mr. Highway off the bridge. It didn't hurt anybody. Mark sat there in the back porch, watching the sun shine off the snow as morning gradually started giving way to afternoon. He took a drag off the cigarette, smiling at the fact that he was already doing a better job of acting as casual as Henry always did about it. There were some aspects of Henry that Mark liked, maybe even admired; Henry saw the rules as something that did not necessarily rule his life. To him, having fun and doing what you wanted to do was more important. He was afraid of nothing, it seemed; Mark wondered what Henry was like at school. He had to be as unusual a personality there as he was at home. Mark still wasn't at all sure what to do or think about Henry; his cousin was not an easy person to figure out. But he was offering Mark his friendship, even after their disagreements. He wasn't very nice… or maybe he just didn't know how to be. But if Henry had something to teach Mark, it would surely work both ways. Maybe Mark could, if nothing else, show his cousin the benefit of being nice to people sometimes. It was much, much better than simply not caring and letting everybody hate you. But what if Henry couldn't do that? Not just wouldn't, but couldn't ? What if being cold and careless underneath his warm, well-mannered exterior was just a part of who Henry was? Mark shook his head, so wrapped up in his own thoughts he all but forgot Henry was there. And not just there, but watching him curiously, and intently. Mark knew Henry was odd, and sometimes worse than just odd. But Mark needed a friend right now, and Henry seemed to at least be sincere in offering to be that friend. And that had to count for something.[Chapter 7] Chapter VII- Lamenting Richard Before long Henry's parents came home; even before that, Henry and Mark had stubbed out their cigarettes and headed inside. Henry, speaking quietly and with that knowing, confident smirk, noted that it would be better if they were not found on the back porch smoking cigarettes at the tender age of twelve years old. Mark himself still didn't really see the point of it- he didn't like the burning sensation it brought to his lungs and throat. But it was one of Henry's more harmless past-times. Maybe, Mark thought, it would actually be better to encourage Henry in that kind of behavior… so then there might be fewer Mr. Highways. Henry's parents soon had lunch on the table, and the three younger members of the Evans family joined them in the dining room, sitting at the long, rectangular table. Mark sat across the table from Henry; for right now at least, he still wanted a little distance between him and his cousin. Things were simpler when he sat next to Connie; she was just a perfectly normal kid. She didn't at all have that look Henry did; like Henry might find it fun to kill somebody's dog or cat, just to hear its last cry of pain. Mark appreciated that Henry wanted to be friends… but that didn't change the fact that Henry could be a scary kid. He didn't seem like he'd ever bothered learning how to be nice to people. \"So, what's going on tonight?\" Henry asked as they ate cold cuts with potato salad and cole slaw. \"Well, not much for tonight- but in two days I'm taking your mom out to dinner,\" Wallace said. \"You think you characters can babysit yourselves and not get into too much trouble?\" \"Sire, Dad,\" Henry replied with a smile. \"Oh, boy!\" Connie said. \"It'll be fun!\" Mark felt his stomach start to knot up. The thought of being alone in the house with Connie was one thing; having Henry added into it was another. Henry didn't at all seem like the type you'd want alone with you in the dark. Who knew what Henry might try to do? From the way Henry talked and acted, he didn't at all seem to have the typical boy's fear of the dark. Henry seemed more like the type who embraced the dark… and maybe even came out of it. Mark suddenly felt very cold. He shivered, involuntarily, but just shrugged when Henry gave him an odd look. Definitely not a thought to tell Henry just yet- if ever. But Henry seemed like he already knew. His mouth twitched upward, hinting at that knowing smile. \"Can I stay up late and watch 'Monsterpiece Theater'?\" Connie asked eagerly. \"No,\" Henry said flatly. \"Why not?\" Connie pouted. \"Because it might warp your impressionable little brain,\" Henry said simply. If the thought hadn't been so scary, it might have been funny; here Henry was, warning his sister about how a TV show might be bad for her, when the thing most capable of doing her harm lived right there in the same house, just down the hall from her room. And Mark was no fool; Henry was smart, very smart, and any harm he did to Connie if he chose would be far more harmful than anything a TV show could do. And perhaps, much more permanent. \"I don't have to listen to you,\" Connie fleered. \"You're not the boss.\" Henry's eyes narrowed; his whole body became suddenly tense. He leaned forward and hissed, \"Yes I am, vermin.\" Susan's eyes widened. \"That's about enough, Henry.\" Connie looked at her mother curiously. \"What's a vermin?\" \"Nevermind, Connie,\" Wallace said. \"It was something Henrys should not have said.\" Wallace looked pointedly at his son as he said this. \"And something he won't say again,\" Susan added, looking straight at Henry as well. Henry blinked; for just a moment, he looked startled somehow. Then Mark watched him shift not just his expression, the look in his eyes; somehow in just a second's time, Henry's whole posture changed. Mark watched him turn into a friendly, smiling son once again. \"Oh, Dad, Mom,\" he said, \"guess what? Mark was saying that he might like to move into Richard's room.\" Mark's jaw dropped. He hadn't ever said anything like that! Wallace considered this. \"You know, that's not a bad idea,\" he said. Mark watched Susan stiffen. In just an instant, he could see that putting Richard's room to any use was a big source of disagreement between Susan and Wallace. \"Darling,\" Susan said to Wallace, \"we've been over this before. You know why we haven't done that already.\" \"Which is all the more reason why we should be considering it now,\" Wallace said as gently as he could. \"Mark seems to like it in there,\" Henry put in, as if to add fuel to the fire. \"But- that's not true-\" Mark stuttered, but suddenly he felt a sharp jolt of pain as Henry's foot shot out and kicked him under the table. \"Come on, Mark,\" Henry said with a sly smile, \"Don't lie.\" Mark's mouth opened, but no words came out. He was flabbergasted by this latest scheme of Henry's. Why was he doing this? It didn't make any sense. Henry had been saying he wanted to be friends with Mark, but here he was, lying and stirring up trouble just for the fun of it. At the far end of the table, Susan and Wallace were deep in a discussion that was bordering on becoming a full-blown argument. Mark had a sure feeling that this was just what Henry had been counting on to happen. \"Honey, I really think you should give it some thought,\" Wallace was saying to his wife. \"We can't keep the room like it's been; not forever. It's turning into a museum, and I can't see how that's good for the kids.\" Mark could see that Susan was barely keeping it together; she was struggling to maintain control of her emotions. Clenching a napkin tightly in her hand, she stared over at her husband. \"I never said it would be forever,\" she insisted. \"I'll change the room when I'm ready.\" She turned to Mark, who felt both terrible and confused- terribly confused- over having any part in making her feel so bad. It didn't change anything that this was all because of a lie Henry told. \"Mark,\" Susan said. \"There's a nice room on the next floor you can use.\" \"But Henry's making it up-\" Kick. Again, Mark turned to see Henry staring innocently back at him, but now with a fiercer look in his eyes. Shut up , the look said. Just can it and ride this out, if you know what's good for you . Regardless, it didn't seem like anyone besides Henry had heard what Mark said. \"Listen to me, honey,\" Wallace said. \"If Mark moved in there, it could help. That room needs to be lived in. I'm not saying you should throw any of the toys or other stuff away.\" Susan was on the verge of tears. \"I really don't want to discuss this right now,\" she said tightly, indicating she'd said all she had to say on the matter. But Wallace wouldn't let it go. \"I know you don't want to discuss it. But we've got to face it. We can't keep trying to forget about it.\" Chair legs scraped the floor as Susan abruptly stood up. She was trembling, visibly fighting back tears. \"I am facing it!\" she cried. \"I face it every day. You're the one who's forgetting.\" All eyes were on the Evans elders now, but Mark's eyes drifted back to Henry. The blonde kid had brought a hand to his face, and Mark was the only one who saw. Henry was smirking. It was like he was enjoying this; like Henry got a kick out of seeing others in pain. Mark was stunned; he had never seen someone Henry's age act like this before, ever. Mark considered jumping up and yelling that Henry was at fault here; that he'd been the one who started the whole thing. But just as soon as the idea occurred to Mark, he rejected it. They'd never believe him. Plus, it would infuriate Henry, who no doubt loathed tattle-tales, even if they had a point. Perhaps especially if they had any valid point. Susan started to walk out of the room. \"Please don't walk away from this,\" Wallace said, rising halfway out of his chair. \"Susan, please.\" But Susan had left the room, and they could hear her footsteps hurrying up the stairs. It was obvious she wasn't coming back. \"Oh, Christ,\" Wallace muttered, sitting back down and putting his head in his hands. For a moment the room was silent. Nobody moved. Mark could hear Susan's footsteps as she reached the second floor and started down the hallway above them. Wallace also looked up; everybody in the dining room knew she was going to Richard's room. Mark looked around the table. Wallace looked sad, and even Henry had managed to shift his expression to one appropriate for the moment, appearing dismayed himself. Only Connie looked puzzled, as if she still didn't understand what had happened. \"Daddy?\" she asked. Wallace looked over at her. \"What is it, honey?\" \"What's a vermin?\" Connie asked. Mark felt for Connie; the poor kid was so young and innocent. She really did not understand what was going on. Then Mark looked across the table, curious to see how Henry had reacted to the question. Henry again had covered his mouth with his hand. He looked like he was holding back laughter again. Susan pushed open the door to Richard's room and stepped inside. She felt a tear roll out of her eye and down her cheek. It was sad to think about, but she'd realised long ago that Wallace would never understand the way she felt. It hurt to think that he didn't feel the same way, but they were, after all, two different people. Everyone had a different way of dealing with grief. Wallace internalized it, compartmentalized it and sectioned it off in his brain. As an Air Force PJ for eight years, he'd had to. Sometimes the people you went out to rescue- or the ones who went out to rescue them with you- didn't come back. In his own way, Susan was sure Wallace felt the pain of Richard's loss as deeply as she did. He just dealt with the pain differently. Susan sat down on the bed and gazed around the room. Standing on the night table was a small toy mirror. Richard had gotten it on his second birthday. The frame was the face of Donald Duck. Susan picked up the frame, gazing into the mirror silently. Then she saw something that took her by surprise. In the mirror's reflection, Susan was startled to see Henry standing in the doorway. She could tell that he wasn't aware she was looking at him, or that she even knew he was in the room. On his face was the oddest smile. It was almost contemptuous. Almost a smirk. Startled to see such a look on her son's face, Susan spun around. Henry looked surprised for a moment. Then the startled look passed, so quickly it was like it had never been there. Now the look on Henry's face was one of the deepest sympathy. So fleeting had been the look of surprise- and the one of contempt- that Susan could only assume she'd been mistaken about the earlier look on Henry's face. Her son stepped towards her, putting his hand on her shoulder. \"Don't cry, Mom,\" he said softly. \"Don't cry.\" He's such a dear boy , Susan thought. So sweet and thoughtful . At times almost more so than her husband. Almost too good to be true, Susan sometimes would say of Henry. But this was one time she was glad it was true. Susan took Henry's hand and pressed it against her damp cheek. \"Thank you, Henry,\" she whispered. \"Thank you for understanding.\" And Henry looked down at his mother; for a moment, while she looked up at him, the expression of sympathy was there. But just as soon as he knew she wouldn't be looking up again all that soon, Henry looked down at his mother with an expression that was almost perfectly blank, a very dark something dancing behind the look of bemused contempt that again appeared in his eyes.[Chapter 8] Chapter VIII- After Dinner Mark was left deeply unsettled by Henry's actions at lunch; he made a point of avoiding Henry for the rest of the day. Henry didn't much seem to mind; whenever Mark saw him, his cousin seemed preoccupied with thoughts and tasks of his own. When Henry set about the business of doing something, he was very no-nonsense about it. All afternoon, Mark watched from Henry's room as his cousin came and went from the shed out in the backyard. What fascination it held for Henry, Mark wasn't sure. But it was obvious his cousin used it as a workshed of some kind; Mark had seen that when he'd gone in there to meet Mr. Highway. Dinner came and went pretty quietly; the Wallace elders managed to patch up the difficulties of earlier in the day, and the final meal of the day was conducted with a pointed refusal to acknowledge that anything had gone wrong earlier in the day. Everyone already knew, so there was no point in bringing it up. After dinner, though, Mark decided he'd about had enough. He didn't like what Henry had done earlier, and he felt like he'd done something wrong by not telling anyone about it. He didn't like feeling as if he was Henry's accomplice; not if Henry was going to do these things and tell him nothing about it. When Mark got upstairs, Henry was at his desk, humming to himself and looking at a model submarine in his hands. It looked hand-carved, expensive- the stand it normally held it, also made of wood, read HMS Vanguard . Mark decided to take a leaf out of Henry's own book. He would not be hesitant, he would not be subtle. He would just storm right in and let Henry know just how displeased he really was. Henry was still sitting at his desk, pausing a moment to switch on his desk lamp, when Mark strode rapidly into the room. Henry turned, smiling a little in greeting. \"Oh, hey, Mark.\" But Mark wasn't in a mood for casual greetings. He grabbed Henry, who squawked in surprise as he was hauled up from the desk, the model submarine dropping from his hands. For just an instant, Mark wasn't sure what he was going to do. He had a feeling his cousin was stronger than him, had a better idea of proper hand-to-hand fighting. But Mark still held the element of surprise, and was determined not to waste it. Recalling some action movie he'd seen once- or something- Mark swiftly brought up his left knee, right between Henry's legs. \"Oof!\" Henry gasped, and Mark dropped him. Henry collapsed to his knees, doubled over and grimacing in pain. But after a moment, he startled Mark by starting to laugh. \"It… ah ! It feels… good… Mark.\" Henry managed to force the words out; Mark stared down at his cousin, stunned. Was Henry absolutely crazy? Did he actually like getting hit like this? About a full thirty seconds passed before Mark spoke. Still angry, he hissed, \"That was real mean, what you did at lunch. Don't you dare do those things; not without telling me first!\" Henry just laughed again, that strange sound of a boy clearly in pain but somehow liking it. \"I guess I deserved that,\" Henry said, struggling back to his feet. Mark just tossed his head as if to snap at his ear, looking at Henry with annoyance and contempt. \"Yeah, you did,\" Mark hissed, and Henry grinned. Pain suddenly exploded in Mark's lower half; with a startled grunt he dropped to the floor, painfully landing on one of his elbows. Agony rolled up and down Mark's stomach, and he curled up into a fetal position without even thinking about it. Hey, the pain seemed to be saying, how ya doin'? I'm gonna be hanging around for about a good five minutes at least; that's the big show. But I'll be around in some form for the next half hour, that much at least. How's that sound? Pretty darned bad? Great! Above him, through the haze of pain rolling around in his balls, Mark could hear Henry laughing. He was still bent over slightly, grimacing a little at the pain Mark had caused him, but was vastly amused at the return fire he'd given his cousin. \"You didn't know I could do that, did you, Mark?\" Henry all but crowed. \"Ha ha ha! Wrong. You don't wanna fuck with me, Mark. Ever.\" Mark looked up; Henry still looked amused, even sounded like it- but an edge of steel had come into his voice at those last words. Henry meant what he said at these moments. After a while of sitting there on the hardwood floor, gasping like a fish as waves of pain hit him, Mark finally said, \"Help me up.\" Henry laughed. \"Why?\" \"We're supposed to be friends!\" Mark gasped. \"And? You just kneed me in my special place! My tender bits!\" Henry said with mock indignance. \"Well,\" Mark managed to force out, still curled up on the floor, \"We're even now, right?\" Henry folded his arms, considering this. Finally, he reached down and helped Mark stand, walking him over to the second bed on the other side of the room. Henry flopped down on his own, still shaking his head at Mark and laughing. \"You really didn't know I could do that, huh?\" \"Where'd you learn that?\" Mark asked, once he'd recovered enough to talk normally. Henry shrugged. \"At school. Some of the bigger kids wanna mess with me at school, Mark. I'm faster than they are.\" Mark sighed, staring up at the ceiling, grateful the pain was starting to fade. \"Obviously,\" Mark said, and Henry chuckled. The heat of the moment eventually passed, as did the pain Mark and Henry managed to cause one another. Mark was still startled by the fact that Henry seemed to not only enjoy seeing others in pain, but even to feel pain being done to himself. He asked Henry about it, but the boy just shrugged. \"I like it,\" he said, almost in a voice that said he didn't himself understand why. Mark persisted, asking Henry about it, but Henry just smiled and shrugged. \"I'll show you what I see sometime, Mark. Not today, though.\" Finally, Mark gave up, and conversation shifted to other things. Henry talked about tanks and artillery, of the Minuteman III missile and the Trident missiles carried by nuclear submarines of the United States and Britain; missiles that carried warheads that, if used in enough numbers, could destroy civilization around the world. Henry's eyes grew bright as he talked of the damage those weapons could cause, of the ability they gave a few select men to destroy entire cities, to kill millions at the turn of a key. For just an instant Henry's voice took on a hint of a savage, twisted greed- of an insatiable hunger to one day hold that power for himself. Mark shivered in spite of himself, and he went to sleep that night thankful he'd chosen, so far anyway, to remain Henry's friend. Henry Evans, more and more, seemed like a boy who made a very bitter enemy. But not for very long.[Chapter 9] Chapter IX- The Lake Mark opened his eyes. He was lying on the bed in a room filled with light. An emerald green wool blanket covered him. For a moment, Mark wondered where Henry was, and then with a surge of irritation realised Henry had probably just gotten up earlier, and left Mark where he was. Again. Then it all came back to him in a rush. Henry causing that bitter argument between Susan and Wallace at lunch yesterday, and Mark rushing upstairs to show Henry what he thought of that after dinner. Then Mark remembered how Henry had almost seemed to enjoy being in pain, and had recovered with surprising swiftness to inflict even greater pain on Mark. Mark remembered being thankful he wasn't Henry's enemy. But he swiftly got up, resolving as he headed for the bathroom that however dangerous Henry might be, Mark would not live in fear of him. He was not going to turn tail and run just because Henry was a swift sucker-puncher. Or kicker. Making his way down the hall after brushing his teeth, Mark noticed Connie's room was also empty. Suddenly Mark felt very alarmed. A sudden panic gripped him; where was she? Mark was a moment from dashing out of the room when he heard a young girl's voice coming from outside. Mark stepped to the window at the end of the hall, looking down outside. Connie was wearing her pink snowsuit and talking cheerfully to herself as she built a snowman in the backyard. Mark smiled to himself, feeling a wave of relief. Connie was all right, for now at least. A little while later, Mark went down the stairs, pulling on a blue sweater as he went. He intended to grab a quick bite of breakfast and then go outside; the pretext of helping Connie with her snowman sounded convenient. Mark got to the bottom of the stairs and started for the kitchen; he thought he could hear voices. Strained, emotional voices. Through the doorway to the kitchen Mark could see Wallace with his arm around Susan. Susan's head was bent, and her voice was sad. \"I can't explain it,\" Susan was saying. \"Is it Richard's room?\" Wallace asked gently. \"That's part of it.\" \"Look, I don't care about the room,\" Wallace said. \"If it helps you somehow to leave it the way it is, that's fine.\" Susan looked up at her husband. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes,\" Wallace said. \"But there's more to this than that. You've got to stop blaming yourself for Richard's death. It wasn't your fault.\" \"But I left him alone in the tub,\" Susan said, sounding pained. \"In six inches of water,\" Wallace said. \"It was a freak accident. He was sitting there in the tub and the phone rang. You did what anyone would have done. You told yourself no two-year-old could possibly drown in six inches of water, and then you went to answer the phone. I would have done the same thing.\" \"But you didn't,\" Susan said. \"I did.\" \"It was a freak accident,\" Wallace repeated. \"Honey, you can't go through life blaming yourself.\" \"I do,\" Susan said. \"No matter how I try to forgive myself or rationalize it, I still do. I just can't forgive myself for doing it.\" \"You've got to,\" Wallace said, firmly but gently. \"Look what it's doing to us. We can't even have lunch on a weekend without risking some kind of fight in front of the kids. It's not right for you, or for them.\" \"I know,\" Susan said, leaning into him and pressing her forehead against his shoulder. \"I'm sorry, I really am. I don't mean to be like this. I don't meant to push you away… It's just so difficult.\" \"I know it is.\" Wallace slid his arms around her and looked up at the kitchen clock. \"Sweetheart, I have to go.\" \"You sure?\" Susan grabbed the sweater he was wearing and held it tight. \"You know I wouldn't go if I didn't have to,\" Wallace said, giving his wife a hug. \"I love you.\" \"I love you,\" Susan replied, her voice a strained whisper. From down the hall, Mark watched Wallace turn and leave. Six inches of water, he thought. That's what Richard drowned in. He tried to imagine what a two-year-old looked like. They weren't really babies anymore; people called them toddlers instead. They walked pretty certainly, and had almost complete control of their bodies. Mark had heard stories about how little water it took to drown in- and how short a height it took to fall and be killed when you hit the ground. Maybe a baby could drown in six inches of water; a baby would have a hard time pushing itself back up to a sitting position. But a toddler? Henry. Mark tried to shake the thought from his mind. It was a terrible, awful thought; but it wouldn't go. And somehow, it also seemed to fit. If there was anyone in the world who could drown a two-year-old that was also their brother... not only do it, but live with themselves afterwards… it was Henry. Mark walked slowly toward the kitchen, hoping that Susan would have had time to pull herself together. She had turned away and now faced the kitchen sink, her head still bowed. Mark stopped, then made a few steps deliberately louder, to warn her he was on his way. Susan's head snapped up. She turned and looked at Mark, a smile coming to her lips so quickly it was a little too obvious it was forced. \"Good morning, Mark.\" \"Good morning.\" \"Want some breakfast?\" Susan asked. Mark nodded; he probably had some time for that. \"What would you like?\" Mark shrugged, consciously imitating Henry's nonchalant manner. \"Whatever's best this morning,\" Mark said. Susan laughed, seeming genuinely cheered by the flawless imitation of her son. She set to work making some scrambled eggs, pouring Mark a glass of orange juice as she worked. Before long, the eggs were ready, and Mark gratefully began to eat while Susan busied herself around the kitchen. \"You sleep okay last night?\" Susan asked, and Mark nodded. \"Good. I hope things are all right with you and Henry. If you really do need to move to another room, we can probably arrange something.\" Mark thought about that for a moment, but ultimately shook his head. There wasn't any need for that; not really. Henry was Henry, and even if he slept in another room at night, Mark would have to deal with him regardless. And Henry seemed like the type of boy who almost owned the night. He had no reason to fear the dark because he had embraced it. Mark wanted to know more about that. He thought of Henry's words to him earlier: he was tired of being scared. Mark just shook his head. \"Everything's fine,\" he said simply. Susan looked at him curiously. \"Are you sure, Mark? You can tell me if there's something you need to say.\" Mark paused, uncertain now as to what he should do. Should I tell her ? Mark wondered, but immediately realised he had no idea where to start. None. How was he supposed to tell Susan who her son Henry was turning out to be, what he was really like? How, indeed? \"It's about Henry,\" Mark began cautiously. \"Henry?\" Susan seemed confused by that. \"You two seem to be getting along all right.\" She paused, then added, \"Well, you can say what you want to- Henry's not in the house.\" The second's worth of relief Mark felt was followed quickly by sudden apprehension. \"Where is he?\" \"He went out with Connie.\" Mark quickly went to the window and looked outside. The snowman Connie had been working on was now standing by itself; two pieces of coal for eyes while a short, crooked branch stood in for a nose. \"Out?\" Mark said, fighting a rising feeling of panic and not doing so well at it. \"Yes,\" Susan said. \"Actually, Henry was very cute about it. He said they weren't spending enough time together.\" Oh, God! Mark thought. His heart began to race. \"I think he's a little jealous that you and Connie-\" Mark raced back over to Susan, cutting her short. \"Where'd they go?\" he asked desperately. \"The lake a few miles down the road. It freezes over in the winter and people go ice skating there.\" Susan looked at Mark, puzzled. \"Why? What's wrong, Mark?\" Mark couldn't explain; there wasn't time. \"Where is the lake? How do I get to it?\" \"Go to the end of the driveway and make a left,\" Susan said. \"Follow the road about a hundred yards and then make a right down Chamberlain Lane. You'll see it soon enough.\" \"Thanks,\" Mark said, bolting from the kitchen. \"Hold on!\" Susan called after him, now genuinely startled. \"What's the rush?\" Mark had no time to answer. He had his boots and jacket on in seconds, and moments later was racing outside. The air was cold, and Mark ran with great plumes of vapor trailing behind him as he panted, running hard through the snow and slush. He quickly found Chamberlain Lane and started down it, soon coming to a path through the woods where the snow had been trampled down hard. A dozen yards ahead of him, three girls in brightly coloured parkas walked along with ice skates thrown over their shoulders. Mark dashed past them in a big hurry. Ahead, through the bare brown trees, he could see a rise that led to a ridge. With his heart beating wildly, Mark ran up the incline. At the top he halted, catching his breath. Below him there was a wide lake, covered with a sheet of ice that must have gone down for well over two feet below the surface. There must have been a hundred people, mostly kids, skating on it. Mark strained his eyes for any sight of Henry and Connie, but there were too many kids in pink snowsuits and white hats. It was impossible to tell which one was Connie. But he had to find her; Mark had to find Connie and warn her before it was too late. He had a horribly certain feeling that he knew what Henry was going to try to do. \"Connie!\" Mark shouted, starting to run again, making his way down the hill and towards the lake. \"Connieeee!\" His shouts were lost amidst the many voices and laughter below. Mark ran onward, hurrying down the slope towards the ice. As he got closer, the bodies gliding along the ice became clearer, more distinctive. His eyes began to pick out young couples and older boys skating with younger girls. \"Connie!\" Mark shouted. The frantic run was exhausting him; he had to stop and rest. Mark staggered over to a tree and leaned up against it, gasping in the chilly air. Where was Connie? Was he already too late?[Chapter 10] Chapter X- On Thin Ice The lake was long and broad, with a slight bend in the middle. Most of the skaters were to Mark's left. But now, he saw a pair break away from the main crowd; a boy, wearing a black cap, a tan jacket, pale blue winter jeans and silvery-green hockey skates was pulling someone smaller. Someone in a punk snowsuit and a white cap. They were still too far away for Mark to see their faces, but he knew. He just knew. \"Connie!\" Mark shouted at the top of his lungs. \"Connie, wait!\" There was no sign she had heard him- or that she even could. The boy- it just had to be Henry- was pulling her with one of his hands while she held on with both of hers. It was as if she was water-skiing. As they left the crowd of skaters, Mark could see that Henry's head was down and his free arm was swinging as he strained to pick up speed. \"Connie!\" Mark launched himself off the tree trunk and started running again. The downhill slope became steeper as he veered off the beaten path and crashed through the unbroken snow, blundering through trees and underbrush with one hand over his face to protect himself from the branches slashing at him. \"Eeeeeeeiiii!\" Now Mark could hear Connie's screams, a mixture of delight and terror, as Henry raced faster and faster, pulling her towards the bend in the lake. Ahead, a line of tall, old trees prevented Mark from seeing what was on the other side. \"Oof!\" Mark crashed through some branches and suddenly found himself flung out onto the ice. \"Hey!\" \"Look out!\" \"Interference!\" A dozen voices were yelling at Mark all at once. Mark found himself in the middle of a group of about a dozen guys, all of them with hockey sticks. He'd stumbled into a hockey game!\" \"Sorry! Really, sorry!\" Mark gasped and propelled himself forward on the ice. The soles of his boots slipped and slid, never meant for use on this kind of surface; but slowly, Mark picked up speed. He had to get around the bend. He had to see what was on the other side. Far out on the ice, Henry had started swinging through a long, arching curve. Connie was bent at the waist, as if it took all her strength to hold on to her brother's hand. \"Connie, let go!\" Mark shouted as he scrambled farther out onto the ice. Now he could see what was out there, what he'd been unable to see earlier; there was a thin wooden barrier painted red and white, warning skaters of thin ice ahead. Henry was skating in a wide curve towards the barrier. As he started to curve around, Connie sung to the outside of the arc. Suddenly, Henry heaved her forward and let go. Like a slingshot, Connie rocketed forward, straight toward the red and white barrier, her small body wobbling back and forth. Her arms flailed in the air as she tried to keep her balance. Connie crashed through the barrier and fell forward on her stomach, but kept on sliding. Her arms and legs were splayed out in all directions, but there was nothing to hold onto. Nothing to stop her. Ahead of Connie, Mark could see how the ice was a dull gray instead of the solid, thick white that preceded it. He could even see a thin layer of water on the surface of the dull gray, thinner ice. Connie slid toward the gray… and then disappeared. \"Oh, my God! Connie!\" Mark screamed. He tried to run faster, but the result was like you'd always see in a cartoon; the faster Mark's legs spun beneath him, the slower he went. Out beyond the white barrier, Connie's head, still covered by the white cap, bobbed to the surface. \"Connie!\" Mark screamed again, and now heads did start to turn his way. Their frenzied, scared tone and persistence was getting attention at last. Now, other skaters began to point at the broken barrier. People started to shout. \"Look! Someone's fallen in!\" \"Get help!\" In an instant, the entire crowd had stopped skating and was either racing in Mark's direction, or had halted to watch what was going on. To Mark's surprise, Henry was skating back towards the spot where Connie now bobbed in the freezing water. Henry stopped, bent down, and began to crawl on his stomach over the ice toward his sister. Now the skaters who were advancing were closing in on the barrier. Once again, Mark was left behind and had to stumble over the ice to catch up. What is Henry doing ? Mark wondered. Was he really trying to save her? The skaters had started to venture beyond the barrier. Henry turned his head, looking back over his shoulder at them. \"Don't come too close!\" he shouted at them. \"The ice is breaking!\" Mark saw Connie's head disappear from sight. Suddenly, Henry's head whipped back toward the hole in the ice, and he crawled right up to the edge, getting just as close as he dared. \"I can't find her!\" Henry screamed. \"I can't find her!\" Mark was still trying to make his way forward; things were made more difficult by a crowd now starting to form, blocking his progress. Suddenly, there were shouts behind him. \"Out of the way!\" \"Make way!\" Mark spun around and saw two men skating toward him. One was carrying a long metal ladder, the other a sledgehammer. Suddenly, there was a loud crack! beneath everyone's feet. \"What was that?\" someone shouted. \"The ice!\" someone else yelled. \"It's cracking!\" \"We got too much weight in one place!\" the man with the ladder shouted. \"Get back, all of you! Get back and spread out!\" The crowd instantly began to back away and spread out. The two men continued, heading out onto the thin ice. The man with the sledgehammer gave it to the man with the ladder. \"It's too thin!\" he yelled. \"You'll have to go it alone!\" Now the last man continued across the ice toward Henry, carrying both the sledgehammer and the ladder. It's taking too long ! Mark thought, still working his way through the watching skaters. Finally, he reached the broken barrier and started through it. Suddenly, a hand landed on Mark's shoulder, halting his forward progress. Mark turned and saw the man who'd been carrying the sledgehammer. \"I have to help,\" Mark gasped. \"You can't go out there,\" the man snapped. \"But she'll drown!\" \"So will you.\" Out on the ice, the other man had dropped down on his knees and slid the ladder towards Henry. The crowd around Mark had been murmuring, but now it quieted. On the ice, Herny turned and saw the man was on the ladder, crawling toward him. \"She's not there!\" Henry shouted. \"Go back!\" the man shouted in turn. \"But…\" \"Go back along the ladder, now !\" Henry started crawling away; the crowd was stunned when they saw Henry was trying to go in the other direction. The man scurried out towards Henry on his hands and knees, though, and taking hold of Henry's collar, threw him back towards the thicker ice. Henry grunted as he landed hard near the ladder, but grabbed onto it and headed back towards the barrier. Still on his hands and knees, the man with the sledgehammer crawled as close to the broken ice as he could get; just as Henry had, he went as close as he dared. \"What's he doing?\" someone near Mark asked. \"Looking for her.\" \"But she's not there.\" \"She went under. She could be anywhere.\" In the distance, Mark could hear an ambulance siren approaching, His throat felt constricted. His heart beat like mad. No , Mark thought desperately. This can't happen. Not to Connie, not like this . Suddenly the man out on the ice grabbed the sledgehammer and swung down hard, White chips of ice flew through the air as the head of the sledgehammer sank in. Tossing the sledgehammer to one side, the man threw himself on his stomach and reached down. His arms disappeared under the ice. A moment later, a white hat appeared. Then he pulled Connie's limp, wet body out. \"He's found her!\" someone yelled. Some of the skaters actually began to cheer. Meanwhile, the man out on the ice bent over Connie and began to give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. \"Was she under there too long?\" someone near Mark asked. \"Wasn't more than a minute,\" the man holding Mark said. \"Does that mean she has a chance?\" Mark asked, desperate for hope. \"Yes,\" the man replied, \"A chance.\" \"Emergency Services is here!\" someone shouted. Mark turned and saw a man and woman hurrying toward the edge of the ice, carrying a stretcher and an oxygen tank. The man out on the ice with Connie saw them. He lifted Connie in his arms and, still giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, skated quickly toward the shore. The crowd watched as the man handed Connie to the Emergency Services people. They quickly strapped her to the stretcher and put the oxygen mask on her, then hurried back down the path they'd followed through the woods. \"They've stopped the CPR,\" someone said. \"They're giving her oxygen. She must be breathing.\" Mark felt a weak wave of relief sweep over him. Around him, some people started skating again. Others had had enough excitement for one day and headed for shore. Henry , Mark thought. He looked around and saw a small crowd of people surrounding someone on a rock on the shore. As he walked in that direction, he replayed in his mind what had just happened. Had anyone else seen Henry pulling Connie toward the barrier? Yes, but they'd probably thought it was just two kids fooling around. Even to Mark, Henry's actions were hard to decipher right now. It looked so much as though they were just having fun, as though Henry had simply been pulling Connie along for fun and had simply lost control near the barrier. Had it been any other kid, Mark would have assumed it was an accident, and given thought to no other possibility. But it wasn't any other kid. It was Henry . Now Mark knew why Henry had gone back to the hole after Connie had fallen through. The more he thought about it, the more certain he became. Henry hadn't gone back to save her. He'd gone back to watch. Memories flashed through Mark's mind: the way Henry had stared at the dead dog. The way he'd watched the accident after throwing Mr. Highway off the bridge, raising his arms and shouting in triumph. The way Henry had asked Mark if he'd seen his mother after she'd died. The way he'd said he'd taken a good look at his brother Richard when he'd died. Henry liked to watch terrible things happen, especially if he had caused them. He liked to see death. As Mark neared the small crowd, he could see that Henry was at the centre of it. Someone had thrown a blanket over his shoulders, and someone else was crouching down in front of him and talking. Henry's head was bowed, and he nodded every once in a while. What a great actor , Mark thought. It took all his self-control not to push through the crowd and smash his fist into his cousin's cherubic little face. Mark stepped closer. Now Henry looked up and spotted him. For a moment the two boys just stared at each other. Mark could almost see the crooked, knowing smile. But it wasn't on Henry's lips. It was in his eyes.[Chapter 11] Chapter XI- Visiting the Hospital Susan had been in the living room. She'd been standing by the piano, looking at the photograph of Richard. He'd been a strong boy for his age, already steady on his feet. How could he how drowned the way he did? It was a question she'd asked herself almost every day, almost every waking hour, since the terrible thing had happened. There was still no answer; none she had so far come up with seemed to completely fit. She, Henry, and Richard had been in the house that day. Wallace had taken Connie to the store, and Susan had left Richard sitting up in the tub, playing with his bath toys. When she came back, he was facedown. In six inches of water. And that left Henry… Susan shook the thought from her mind. No, she mustn't think that. She mustn't. It was an awful, terrible thing to think- and it simply could not be true. Susan hated herself for even considering it. No, Richard's death had been an accident , just like Wallace had said. In six inches of water. And then the phone rang. It was Wallace; he'd been in town when someone he knew grabbed him and told him what had happened at the lake. Connie had fallen through the ice while skating, and the Emergency Services people had taken her to the hospital. From that second on, Susan hadn't stopped moving. She'd grabbed her coat and catapulted herself out of the house. The still close-to-new Grand Voyager the family owned received some of its roughest treatment yet that day; a dead-cold start in the midst of a harsh Maine winter, followed by a frantic ten-minute race to the hospital in nearby Rockbridge. The van had gotten her to the hospital; that was all Susan knew or cared about. Had the Plymouth been twenty years old instead, and broken down halfway to the hospital, Susan would have only taken note of this for an instant. Then she would have walked. Susan parked in the first space she found at the hospital; she ran across the parking lot, dashed up the stairs, and burst through the front door, her coat flying behind her. The entire time, all Susan could think of was one thing. Not again . Oh, please, God, don't let it happen again. She'd cursed the elevator for its slowness all the way up to the fourth floor, then ran out and flew down the corridor, dodging patients on walkers and in wheelchairs. Ahead, Wallace stepped out of a room, talking to a doctor in a white coat with a stethoscope hanging around his neck. Hearing the rapid approach of her footsteps, he turned. For a split second Susan stopped, desperately searching his face for news. Oh, please, God, please! A small, grim smile appeared on Wallace's face. \"She's going to be all right, Susan.\" Susan's knees turned to Jell-O. Suddenly weak with relief, she crumpled into her husband's arms. Thank God! The man who'd stopped Mark from crossing the barrier gave him a ride to the hospital. Mark had explained that he was the cousin of the girl who had almost drowned. The man knew Henry because he had a son the same age, and they'd been on the same soccer team the year before. The man politely refrained from telling Mark that most of the boys on Henry's team didn't really like him; he was a skilled and determined soccer player, but… cold. He just didn't seem to be able to rub most any of the boys quite the right way. The man also would have refrained from telling Mark- had the man known this- that his son was absolutely terrified of Henry, who had once held the boy's grapes hostage with a boxcutter, grinning maliciously at the man's son's terrified whimpers, and the desperate, frightened look in his eyes. What the man did tell Mark was the truth, regardless: he was impressed with Henry today. What some of the boys at school thought of Henry was one thing; what had happened today was quite another. \"He was a mighty brave boy,\" the man said as they pulled into the hospital parking lot. \"Yeah,\" Mark said, nodding. He wasn't sure what else to say, beyond \"If only you knew\", and Mark knew that wasn't an option here. Nobody would get it. By the time Mark got to Connie's room, Wallace, Susan and Henry were already there. Mark assumed that one of those sympathetic people who'd comforted his cousin had brought him to the hospital. He just hoped that Susan and Wallace would be so distracted by what had happened to Connie that they would never think to ask why he and Henry hadn't come together. The door was open, but Mark knocked lightly anyway. Wallace looked up. \"Come in, Mark,\" he said. Mark entered the room. Henry was sitting close to Susan; she had her arm around him. Connie lay in her hospital bed, her eyes closed, fast asleep. Near her a small green monitor emitted bleeping sounds as it tracked her heartbeat. \"She's okay?\" Mark asked. \"Yes,\" Wallace said, \"She's going to be fine.\" \"Great.\" Mark felt relieved. He sat down in an empty chair in the corner and gazed at Connie. She'd been lucky. Very, very lucky. But he should have been there sooner. He should have never left her alone with Henry like that. \"Mark?\" Mark turned and saw Susan was looking at him. \"Yes?\" Mark said. \"You went to the lake, didn't you?\" An apprehensive feeling swept over Mark, but he nodded steadily enough. \"Did you see what happened?\" Mark's lips parted, but he said nothing. He couldn't think of what to say. \"I don't think he got there until later,\" Henry said. Mark knew it was the wrong time to say something; or to do something. Susan reached up and smoothed Henry's hair appreciatively. \"What you did was very brave. You saved your sister.\" Mark watched as Henry smiled, drinking up his mother's adoration. Had he been a cat, he'd have purred like a lawnmower. Mark watched helplessly, knowing this was just the sort of thing Henry lived for. He was furious with his cousin; Mark wanted to reorganize his cousin's perfect little face. Maybe blood it up a bit. Hatred, sudden and violent, surged through Mark. He was startled by the feeling; so much so, in fact, that he had to almost physically restrain himself from jumping up and attacking Henry right then and there. Later , he told himself. Soon . Susan, for her part, felt strangely uncertain about the day's events, and even the nagging question of Henry and his role in things kept coming back. After enough time feeling that strange uncertainty, an odd, implacable feeling of fear, Susan gave up and went back to the hospital a few hours later. Suddenly, in fact, the urge was overwhelming. She just had to go back and be with Connie. She didn't want her daughter to be alone. Bleep! Bleep! Bleep ! The only sounds in the dark hospital room came from the heart monitor and the breaths Connie took in her sleep. The only light came from the thin green line on the monitor that jumped with every heartbeat. Susan sat in the corner behind the door, just listening. She knew she had to be there, but she wasn't so sure of why. Strange thoughts ran just below the surface of her consciousness, like fish in a dark sea. She knew they were there, but she couldn't see them. Or was it that she didn't want to see them? Suddenly the door cracked open, letting in a shaft of light. Susan almost said something, but she felt a sudden urge to remain quiet and still. The door opened farther. In the light from the hall, Susan saw Henry step into the room. Without turning on the light, he walked quietly toward his sister's bed. What's he doing here ? Susan wondered. Why hasn't he turned on the light ? Her hands gripped the arms of the chair tightly as she watched Henry walk to the side of the bed and hover silently over his sleeping sister. Then he slowly turned and gazed at the heart monitor. The reflection of the bleeping light was like a line of war paint across Henry's darkened face. He even seemed aware of this himself, silently drawing a line across his face, his eyes tracking the light the monitor was reflecting towards him. Susan felt very strange about all she was seeing. Why is he staring at it like that? What strange fascination does it hold for him? Henry's intense stare shifted now and then between the heart monitor and Connie. His pale hands gripped the railing of Connie's bed tightly, and his eyes were bright and intensely alive… but cold. They looked like gleaming black diamonds, able to reflect brightly but cold as the heart of a blizzard. Suddenly, Susan felt afraid. \"Henry?\" Henry spun around, perhaps a little more quickly than he meant to. Or rather, more quickly than he would have done, had he known beforehand he had an audience. Henry's surprised expression was caught in the light of the lamp Susan had just switched on. For just a moment, only an instant, he looked like a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming car. But then he quickly recovered his composure, and smiled his most charming, boyish smile. But the smile disconcerted Susan. \"Mom,\" Henry said, \"I didn't see you.\" \"Shh, don't wake your sister.\" Susan brought a finger to her lips and quietly got up. \"What are you doing here? I thought you were home with Dad.\" Henry turned back to the bed and gently brushed a strand of hair out of Connie's eyes. \"I was worried about Connie,\" he said softly. \"Did she wake up yet?\" \"She was up for a little while before,\" Susan said. \"She seemed very confused.\" \"About what?\" Henry said, and a sudden shift in his eyes said he'd realised he'd asked the question a shade too quick. It was as if he was worried about something. Susan reluctantly registered her son's reaction, but responded regardless. \"About why she's in the hospital,\" Susan said. \"I don't think she remembers much about what happened.\" Was it her imagination… or did Henry's face appear to sag slightly with relief? \"That's good,\" Henry said, nodding as much to himself as to Susan. \"It's probably best if she forgets the whole thing.\" Susan watched him closely, a feeling of extreme discomfort percolating just below the surface. \"Henry, what did happen at the lake?\" Henry looked puzzled. \"I told you, Mom, it was an accident.\" \"Of course.\" Susan nodded and forced a slight smile on her face. Henry's face suddenly became sad. \"I know I've always treated her like a bratty little kid sister. But until today… I don't think I realised how much she meant to me.\" Susan regarded her son for a moment. She'd seen him act this way before. So sweet, so earnest, even remorseful. Sometimes he had truly seemed too good to be true. Now she found herself starting to wonder. There was the other day when he'd come into Richard's room. Susan remembered well the glimpse she'd gotten of Henry in that little mirror, before Henry knew she'd seen he was there. It was a glimpse of a different boy. The same boy she'd just seen slip into the hospital room, believing he was alone. Was it possible that he was acting? That this was all an act? A slightly sickening sensation threatened to invade Susan, and she chastised herself, finally, for ever letting herself think this way. No, that couldn't be so. She was just imagining things. Henry was her son. And yet… \"Does Dad know you're here?\" Susan asked. \"No, I sneaked out,\" Henry said. \"Guess I should have told him, huh?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, I better get home before he notices,\" Henry said. \"You coming?\" \"In a while,\" Susan said. \"You run along.\" Henry turned toward the door. Susan felt the questions still nagging her. It all just didn't add up. \"Henry?\" Susan asked. \"Yes, Mom?\" He spun around and faced her. Was there something guilty in his movements? Something overly self-conscious? Or was she just imagining it? Henry gave her an open, innocent look. Susan changed her mind. It couldn't be; no twelve-year-old could be that evil and conniving. It just wasn't possible. \"Never mind,\" Susan said. \"I'll see you back at the house.\" Henry nodded, taking one last look at Connie. \"Tell her I was here, okay?\" \"I will.\" Henry smiled and left the room. Susan could hear as Henry headed back down the hall, whistling to himself as he went. Perhaps a minute later, there was a crashing noise, and two boys cried out down the hall. One voice in surprise, the other in anger. Startled, Susan jumped up and ran to the door, looking around in the hallway. Springing out from a janitor's closet left open, Mark had tackled Henry while the blonde was on his way back to the elevators. Even at this distance, Susan could see a furious fistfight beginning; Mark, having gained the edge with the element of surprise, was quite literally beating the hell out of Henry. Crying out in alarm, Susan raced down the hall toward the boys. Neither of them seemed to hear her, or notice she was there. As she got closer, Susan noticed something very strange. Henry was getting hit viciously; for some reason Mark was beyond mere anger. He was landing blow after blow, and with one well-placed punch, Henry's nose was spilling blood down his face. But Henry wasn't fighting back. Susan sprinted down the hall now, shouting for them to stop. But as she raced to pull Mark off her son, Henry's blue eyes suddenly darted over towards Susan. \"No, Mom!\" Henry shouted, so suddenly she stopped short. Then, she watched as Henry's eyes flicked back to Mark, who had a fist pulled back and aimed straight at his cousin, his face contorted in fury. \"Go on, Mark!\" Henry shouted, his voice strained. \"I deserve it!\" Just as suddenly as Mark's anger had come, though, it was gone. The fist he had drawn back fell limply, and Mark rolled off his cousin and lay beside him, both boys panting hard. A nurse, drawn by the noise, raced over towards them, looking between the boys and Susan. \"What happened? For the love of- what happened to these two?\" Susan just stared; she really had no idea. \"I'm not too sure.\" But it was Henry who answered, coughing and spitting, spraying a fine mist of blood on the floor in front of him as he rose to his feet. \"I should've looked out for my sister better,\" Henry said, his voice laced with bitterness. \"Mark was just reminding me of that.\" It took well over an hour to get the boys cleaned up, and assess that no serious damage had been done. Henry's nose would be rather delicate for a few days yet, and he'd received many minor and some more significant bruises, while Mark mostly just got a set of sore knuckles. Even so, the boys wandered out of the hospital easily enough, and though they rode home in silence, they sat side-by-side in the second row captain's chairs of the minivan. Both Susan and the chief nurse-on-duty had tried prodding all manner of answers out of Mark and Henry; neither ended up having much to say. Mark just said, \"I was mad,\" and Henry kept saying it was over the fact that he hadn't protected his sister properly. Susan might have thought the responses strangely rehearsed; but it wasn't that. Instead, Susan wondered if Henry and Mark hadn't had conversations about this before- and perhaps, Mark had today come to feel that Henry was very wrong in ignoring him. Susan drove back to the house feeling very confused; Henry was rather strong for his age, lean and in excellent shape. He never took anything from anyone; yet tonight he'd let Mark basically beat him up and done nothing about it. The two boys seemed more tired than anything else; in fact, by the time the Grand Voyager was back in the driveway, they were sleeping on each other's shoulders. Susan smiled when she saw that; things couldn't be bad, not if something like that was possible. She woke the boys and got them inside, and got to sleep that night more easily than she'd first expected.[Chapter 12] Chapter XII- Making Plans It took about two days for Henry to fully heal up again; he spent most of the first day applying small bags of ice to his face, moaning now and then about how he hoped there'd be no permanent damage. \"I'm too pretty to die,\" Henry would say, which brought amusement to both his parents; they could tell when Henry was putting on a show for them. Mark, after putting a little time into nursing his bruised knuckles, kept to himself for most of the first day back, but remained in the same room as Henry, and talked with him from time to time. Both boys spent time alone, withdrawing into their own worlds and thoughts. Finally, once it was confirmed Connie would have about a week to spend in the hospital- that much at least, while the doctors made sure she completed a full and proper recovery- Henry talked to Mark after the lights were out, three days after the incident at the lake. Mark stared up at the ceiling, his hands folded behind his head. His shirt was off; though he still wore wool pajama pants at night, Mark had taken to imitating his cousin and slept with his upper half bare. He had gotten to like doing it, even after trying it only once or twice; just like Henry, Mark found that for some reason, he just liked doing it. \"You have to get comfortable with yourself, Mark,\" Henry told him seriously when Mark asked about it again. \"Look at it this way. If you don't start getting used to having your shirt off now, how will you know how to get the babes to dig you? That's just a couple of years off.\" Mark was startled by that comment from Henry; at twelve years old, Mark had barely given the idea of girls- and wanting them to look at his body- had hardly crossed his mind. Henry, as with so many other things, was different. But tonight, three days after Henry's awful plan nearly succeeded at the lake- and the two managed to somehow patch things up yet again- Henry had something else on his mind. He wanted to show Mark the greatest thing he'd ever seen- something neither of them would ever, ever forget. He had to make sure Mark was ready first, though. It would do no good if, after all this preparation, Henry ended up having Mark just run off and chicken out on him. It would not do to have Mark go back to Arizona, just the same straight-laced sissy he was before. Not at all. \"Have you ever seen a mansion, Mark?\" Henry asked, also staring up at the ceiling, upper half bare, with his hands folded behind his head. Mark looked over, uncertain. \"Yeah, you mean a big, expensive house, right?\" Henry sniggered. \"This is a big, expensive house, Mark. Mansions are like castles. You don't see 'em often- but when you do see one, you know what it is.\" At that, Mark fell silent briefly. There were people in Arizona with big houses; some of them very big. But they were all new; certainly, new relative to the hundreds upon hundreds of years of history that European immigrants had invested in the new life they'd made in America. Some families living on the East Coast had been there for going on three hundred years. None of Arizona's rich had that kind of history, and there weren't really massive, imposing old estates like the East Coast had. Finally, Mark shook his head. \"I don't think so, not like you have here. Arizona's not as old as Maine.\" Henry took that comment with a smile; he seemed to enjoy being reminded of the fact that his home state had older houses, older families- more tradition and a lot more history. Probably those things just made Henry feel that much more superior to the people in states west of the Mississippi River. Henry seemed to like anything that made him feel superior, for any reason. But after thinking for a few moments, Henry asked, \"Would you like to?\" Mark thought about it a moment, but ultimately nodded. \"Sure.\" Henry smiled. \"Tomorrow, we're gonna go on a long walk, Mark. But I know where we'll be going.\" \"Where's that?\" Mark asked, becoming intrigued by his cousin's mysterious talk in spite of his efforts to resist. Henry just kept that smile, his eyes gleaming in the dark as he realised he had Mark's full attention. \"There's this huge old place, way out on the other side of town. You'll know it's a mansion when you see one, Mark.\" \"What's it called?\" \"Fleetwood Hall.\" Mark thought about that for a moment. \"Does anyone live there now?\" Henry seemed to hesitate, as if trying to find the best way to explain what he was going to have to say next. \"No. My family's actually distantly related to the one that built the place; used to be some of the richest people in all of Maine lived in that house. But nobody's lived there for years.\" \"Why's that?\" Mark asked, curious. \"People think it's… haunted,\" Henry said. \"It's a big, big house. Helen Whitmore was the last member of the family still there, back in the 50's somewhere. She just disappeared one day, and the family had no money to pay the servants, so they all left.\" Henry paused again, his voice took on a hint of real interest- more than that, fascination- as he spoke. \"They did tours for a while… but then one day, someone died.\" Mark gasped a little, in spite of himself. \"How- how did that happen?\" Henry stared up at the ceiling, his eyes gleaming in the moonlight. \"Nobody knows, Mark. She just left the group at some point. Then, two days later, the cops found her purse. Ripped and bloody. But they never found her.\" Mark felt frightened at the idea of it. Vanishing into a massive old house; the way Henry made it sound, this house was huge enough to occupy its own zip code. In truth, Fleetwood Hall was not quite that size… but it was close. But it was also fascinating. Mark had never known houses could be so interesting; in Arizona, all the houses were newer, and didn't have as much history to them. Somehow, it seemed like the more history a house had to it, the more lives that it had seen come under its roof, the more life the house took on itself. But this house didn't sound like that. Mark had never heard of a grand mansion that was abandoned, untouched for decades, because people believed it was haunted. And tours in old houses didn't normally come back one person short. Putting some of his unease to words, Mark asked, \"Do you think it's safe, Henry- I mean, to just go in there?\" Henry shrugged, his pale shoulders moving up and down in one simple movement. \"It can be. You just gotta be careful, like with anything else.\" \"This doesn't sound like anything else.\" Henry smiled, looking over across the room at his cousin. \"It'll be fine, Mark. I've snuck in there plenty of times; nobody will ever know we were there.\" Finally, Mark sighed. His cousin was, when he chose to be, the meanest boy Mark had ever met. The fierce, hateful look Henry would sometimes get in his eyes made Mark wonder if, facing the blonde boy with the blue eyes, even one of Hell's demons might not think twice. As long as Mark was with Henry, nothing in some moldy old house could touch him. Right? \"When are we gonna go there?\" Mark asked after being silent for a minute or so. \"Tomorrow.\"[Chapter 13] Chapter XIII- The Other Side of Town Built in 1909, the largest and most bizzarely-constructed mansion in the northernmost state in New England had been plagued with bad luck and strange occurrences from the start. Fights occurred among the work crews; a foreman was killed by a sheet of falling glass. Even when the initial work was finished, the mansion- soon known for its imposing size and near-priceless grandeur all over the country- the house just seemed… strange. That strangeness had taken on new form in the Thirties, when Preston Whitmore's granddaughter, Elizabeth, had vanished in the house without trace. Only her doll was recovered, left just where she would keep it, in the grand entrance hall at the front of the house, sitting on one of the decorative, hand-carved wooden chairs. The male Whitmores after Preston I had never liked the house much; it seemed to make all of them uneasy, in ways few of them could ever explain in words- but all of them felt and knew. The women, on the other hand, were very different. They were drawn to the house, intrigued by it; and no one loved the house more than the woman it was built for; Eleanor Whitmore, Preston Whitmore's wife. Long after her husband's quirky ideas and designs for the house were all satisfied, she continued writing out new additions, new changes- sometimes rearranging whole halls of rooms and designing a whole new building or wing. The many acres of land the Whitmores owned gave the family plenty of room to work with, and Eleanor made good use of it. The family's falling fortunes after the decline of Preston Whitmore's business empire in the late 1940's didn't slow Eleanor down a bit. Long after her husband's sudden- very sudden- death by falling from the tall clocktower the house featured, Eleanor took to writing out new changes for the house with a vengeance. It became her purpose in life, her obsession. The Whitmore family's immense fortune was gradually spent away as the properties of the family fell into neglect, business obligations and debts were ignored, and Eleanor kept on writing out new designs and plans. Finally, the remaining other Whitmores had enough, separating themselves and more or less leaving their elderly grandmother to her own devices, paying just enough to maintain a skeleton crew of servants, keeping up the house- and its sole devoted resident. After Eleanor Whitmore was seen walking down the Corridor late at night- a hallway so long it was rumoured to appear, or perhaps even be, a half a mile in length- by a maid, the staff cleared out in a hurry when she did not appear again, not even after they searched the house for her for a full day. That night in 1958 was the last time she was ever seen, and for a few years the remaining Whitmores were happy enough to pretend the house- and the iron-willed old lady- had never been there in the first place. At the suggestion of a few hungry members of the local historical society, though, the house was opened as a historical tourist attraction for visitors to Rockbridge, Maine in 1963. The cavernous, outrageously expensive house drew historians, young and old, from all over America- some, even, from over in Europe. Few mansions anywhere had ever been constructed with such a complete disregard for cost, practical use or function, or any adherence to a specific type of architecture. But the tourists slowly thinned in numbers- people would go home and confide to those they trusted, and even then only once, that they felt like the house knew they were there. Knew, and was not happy. The tour guides, busy conducting their charges about the gigantic house, often seemed immune to this feeling- but one quietly told a friend that he felt like the house was watching him. The tours kept going for some twenty years, until Susan West had wandered off from her group in 1982, drawn off for some reason, far off into the nearly-endless depths of the house. At first, the Rockbridge Historical Society had tried to hold out, merely suspending the tours while a search was conducted. Finally, though, when Susan West's handbag was found, torn and splattered with blood that was soon confirmed to be hers, even the most die-hard historian on the RHC's board threw in the towel. The cold, drafty halls of the house, that dark wood paneling that seemed all the more laced with a hidden, quiet hate for its immense beauty, had become a little too obvious to ignore. But the mysterious, troubled history of Fleetwood Hall continued to fascinate, though, and certain historical groups offered the RHC donations merely to leave the house alone. Those few living descendants of Eleanor Whitmore wanted nothing to do with their elderly matriarch's strange, bizarre old mansion. It seemed to have inherited her powerful, brilliantly intelligent presence- but also her deep-running, simmering hatred for men, and for all who did not live up to her lofty standards for conduct in a distinguished family. Eleanor Whitmore was not a nice woman by the time she was last seen, passing a hundred on that June evening in 1958. The house had, it seemed, taken on her spirit- and resolved to continue her work. As they walked across town the following day, Henry explained all this to Mark, telling the tale in bits and pieces- every bit of it fascinated Henry immensely. Mark could tell this had been a subject of great interest to Henry for years. What was strangest to Mark's ears- and surely to anyone's- was that the house didn't always seem to adhere to the blueprints. It was a phenomenon that had first been noticed in the 1940's- Preston Whitmore II had noted in his journal a deep sense of unease as he wandered the halls of the house, especially at night. It seemed like the house sometimes liked to 'change'; that is, change things up. Do things differently. Rooms you'd never seen before- and were nowhere on existing blueprints- would appear, and doors would vanish. The Reversal Room, a perfectly-copied 1930's business office designed to be completely upside-down, was once in a while seen the right way up. The cavernous Mirror Library, its entire floor made of mirrored, reflective glass, would appear one day, and be impossible to find the next. This last fact frustrated historian visitors immensely, as the Mirror Library, with tall bookshelves ringing the circular wall of the room, had one of the most valuable and unique book collections in New England. But, Henry had noted with a smile, folks lost their courage after Miss West made her disappearance. She was not the first to disappear in the house- in fact, if the rumours had any truth, Susan West had merely joined a crowd of more than ten. Mostly Whitmores, but visitors and even a Hollywood socialite had also vanished in the vastness of Fleetwood Hall. Mark felt a strange coldness take hold of him as they walked, in a way that had nothing to do with the weather- in fact, it was actually a relatively warm day. No- it was that house. Mark walked beside Henry readily enough, but began wondering if he might not just let Henry go on in while they got there. Hull Street ran far out on the edge of town; opposite of the area where Henry's family lived, Fleetwood Hall stood imposingly on a sloping, tree-lined hill. Twin brick columns bearing the Whitmore family crest flanked the twin, wrought-iron gates. More than twelve feet in height, the gates stood shut and locked- just as they had been for years. Through them, Mark got his first glimpse of the house- that massive, breathtaking house. Fleetwood Hall. Its exterior built chiefly of brick, the house's massive front loomed imposingly some hundred yards back from the front gate. Countless dozens of tall, dark windows let Mark stare curiously into the house from the gates- though, looking past the massive, long-dry stone water fountain marking the centre of the front of the driveway, Mark distantly wondered if the house wasn't also staring back at him. Henry, standing beside his cousin, could have plucked the thought from his mind. \"It is, Mark; it is,\" Henry said quietly, almost with a reverence. \"What?\" Mark asked, though he knew perfectly well what Henry meant. Henry had no smirk or grin to offer now; even he, it seemed, was feeling some measure of apprehension, of fear. He just said, \"The house, Mark. It sees us. It knows we're here.\" \"Uh… okay.\" Mark felt very nervous. Now Henry did smile; he dropped to his knees, then lay out flat on the ground, slowly crawling sideways towards the gate. Mark watched, fascinated, as Henry slipped under the tall, black iron gates and stood up, brushing himself off and facing Mark. \"Come on, Mark,\" he said, beckoning and starting to walk up the drive toward the house. Mark hesitated; this was against his better judgment. It was early afternoon; Henry had promised his parents they'd be back before dark… but now Mark wondered. Henry looked back and saw Mark still standing on the other side of the gate. He smirked, motioning again for Mark to follow him. \"Are you sure it's safe?\" Mark asked, suddenly wanting an excuse not to go with his cousin. For some reason, he really had doubts that just walking into one of the hugest and creepiest houses in America, a house whose interior seemed to have a life all of its own, was all that good an idea. But Henry just smirked at Mark's nervousness. He cocked his head at Mark, a mocking smile on his face. \"Oh, now Mark. Don't tell me we're gonna have to go through this again. You gotta stop being scared, Mark. Just come on, I want to show you what I found here.\" Finally, Mark sighed. He could always refuse to go in the house, even if he went under the gate. After crawling under the gates in imitation of Henry, Mark stood up, brushed himself off, and stood facing his cousin. But suddenly, Mark was startled to see Henry wasn't there; he was up at the front door, standing before the house, looking up at it with a look of awe on his face.[Chapter 14] Chapter XIV- Fleetwood Hall A/N: Throughout the chapters dealing with Fleetwood Hall, I drew a lot of inspiration for the history, nature and appearance of the house from Rose Red in the TV miniseries by that name; \"Stephen King's Rose Red\". Also, other aspects of these next few chapters additionally draw inspiration from Stephen King's short story \"Gramma\". If you've seen the miniseries and read that short story, you'll know what I'm talking about. If not- just read on. Mark reluctantly walked over to stand beside his cousin; a gust of wind came up the drive then, scattering a thin sheet of snow towards them from one of the drifts nearby. Mark winced, but Henry didn't seem to notice. He just kept looking up at the three panes of tall glass, part of some room directly above the entrance hall. That was probably what passed for the second floor, but it was hard to say- how many floors Fleetwood Hall possessed, as well as how many rooms, depended on who you asked and on what day of the week it was. \"Come on, Evans- you really think I'm gonna believe you don't got five bucks on ya? There better be some dollars today.\" \"I do-don't have anything…\" Cruel laughter. \"Bullshit.\" Mark suddenly gasped, looking around. Where had that come from? The voice of Sean Walters, of himself just a year ago- where had any of it come from? Was his mind just replaying old, none-too-pleasant audio tapes of memory, influenced in its own way by this strange, old house? Looking up at the imposing form of Fleetwood Hall, Mark shivered. Every imported French window was perfectly etched and placed, its frame carved and assembled by hand. Every brick looked just like the next, and yet- also produced with special care- they all looked slightly different. But there was not one mistake in measurements- no brick, window, or roof shingle was even vaguely out of place. The house loomed above Mark, an imperious mix of an English lord's home outside of London and a Gothic cathedral. It drew off multiple styles of European architecture, and somehow, in drawing cues from all the great nations of Europe, it created a type of rich man's house that was uniquely American. At the start of the 20th century, anybody who was somebody had a house that looked like this one. Except ten people hadn't disappeared in most of those houses, never to be seen or heard from again. That was not an especially common trait, even among old estates. Mark didn't like the house, he didn't like how cold it was out here in the yard, and he didn't like the way his cousin seemed so awed by it, almost entranced. He glanced at Henry, who was still gazing up at the house, a distant look in his eyes. \"I don't like this; I think we should go.\" Henry spoke those words suddenly, distantly; it didn't even sound like him, somehow. Mark stared at his cousin, so shocked he could barely think. Those were the exact words Mark had been getting ready to say. Suddenly seized by an urgent need to act, to break this weird moment before it went any further, Mark reached over and shook Henry by the shoulder. \"Hey! Come on, man!\" Henry blinked, looking over at Mark. \"Huh?\" \"You were just staring up at the house.\" Mark pointed, \"Up at those windows. It was kinda creepy.\" The blonde looked back at Mark, then up at the windows. \"Oh. Did I say something?\" \"Yeah,\" Mark said uneasily, \"You said, 'I don't like this. I think we should go.\" At that, Henry laughed. \"I think you're a little out of it today, Mark. Why would I walk you all this way up here, just to say that?\" Mark just looked back at his cousin, unsure of what to say. Now did not seem like a time to mention that Henry's words had been the exact ones Mark had been about to speak. Finally, Henry just shook his head, shaking off whatever had just happened. \"Come on,\" he said, and Mark reluctantly followed as they walked up to the huge, decoratively-carved front doors. Made of heavy white oak, they were solid enough to withstand far more than a winter wind's howls. As Mark eyed them, he guessed somebody had thought to make sure the front doors could stand at least a few hits from most battering rams. Why? No reason. Just in case suddenly Fleetwood Hall needed to be defended against an invading army using Medieval technology. The brass doorknobs were big; round and shiny, they themselves weren't special, except for some reason they looked just a little too big. He couldn't say quite how, or why- but he was sure of that somehow. Somehow. Henry set a hand on Mark's shoulder, looking at him reassuringly. \"We'll be fine, Mark.\" Mark said nothing, but held in place as Henry began to look over the doors. \"What are you looking for?\" Mark said after a few moments, unable to keep quiet about his curiosity. \"Ah!\" Henry gasped; he had set a hand on the right doorknob. It was the same sound Henry had made when Mark had kneed him in the balls a few nights ago- it was as if Henry was in pain, but somehow enjoying it. Mark set a hand on his cousin, trying to shake him out of whatever he was going into again. This whole thing was creeping him out, and for a moment Mark was nearly seized by a crazy urge to just turn and bolt for the gates. Let Henry do whatever he damn well pleased; Mark didn't have to be a part of it. Suddenly, Mark gasped, almost as surprised as Henry had sounded. Henry, he could feel even through the winter coat, was trembling. His entire body was vibrating, as if channeling a current of electricity. Or perhaps something else. Memories of painful blows to the stomach; a bigger boy's face, standing over him after school. \"Come on, Evans. You hit like a girl. Get up and fight like a girl some more.\" Mark, trying to stand again- and being cut down once more, just the same. Walking home that day, wishing Sean Walters would break a leg or something. \"Ah! Damn!\" Henry gasped again, and suddenly his right hand, gripping the doorknob, jerked to the right with a sudden flick of his wrist. The right door swung open. Henry, either not seeing or not caring about the fearful, bewildered look on his cousin's face, walked inside without hesitation. \"What was that?\" Mark asked as they got inside. It was cool in the house, and the entrance hall was indeed cavernous; a family of twelve could have set up complete living quarters here. It was also grand, just as Henry had said- paintings of great age and worth hung on the walls, which were paneled with extremely expensive wood carvings almost everywhere. The old lamps hanging on the walls almost had to be gas; this house might not have a single electric light, not if the Whitmores last to live here had preferred gas lighting instead. A massive staircase, made of dark, polished wood set over a stone base, stood directly before them, at least fifty feet away. Mark marveled at the fossils he could see encased in the black tiles of the floor; this room had enough space that the entrance hall could easily have functioned as a ballroom. Perhaps that had been the idea. Everything about Fleetwood Hall had clearly been designed to impress. Mark was unsure of just how, or in what way- but impressed he was. Henry, gazing around the hall, said quietly, \"It's beautiful, Mark. Isn't it?\" Mark looked back at Henry. He was starting to get a very bad feeling about this whole thing… Finally, Mark repeated his question of a moment ago. \"What was going on earlier? Just there, outside?\" Henry looked back for a moment, seeming to be confused. Then he shrugged. \"Oh, I got you. I dunno, Mark. I guess I'm just kinda tired, you know? We stayed up kinda late last night.\" He paused. \"Besides,\" he swept a hand around the cavernous room, \"I just can't believe my great aunt really built this whole place.\" Mark went very still, staring in amazement. \"You mean- we're related to the Whitmores?\" Henry nodded, his voice taking on a hint of anger. \"They changed the name. Hoped it would break…. I dunno. The family bogies?\" Henry held up his fingers, wiggling them and moaning like a ghost. In spite of himself, Mark laughed. \"So what're we here for?\" The blonde seemed to consider this for a second, as if he had to make up his mind on it. \"I think we'll go see the old library, Mark. The house has several, but we'll go see the coolest one. I found it up on the fourth floor last year. Come on!\" And with that, Henry raced towards the front stairs, ignoring Mark's shouts for him to wait up. He didn't even slow until he'd reached the top of the stairs, then turned and watched with amusement as Mark hurried to catch up. Mark glanced down at the carpet beneath him; it was thick, and like everything else in the house, very expensive. To his left and right, a hallway stretched off into the distance. No lights were on, and with there being few windows in the hall itself, Mark could barely see the end. Henry was heading to the left, walking casually down the hallway. It was dark that way; at best, the light was dim in most areas, and the shadows stood strong and black. \"What have we gotta go that way for?\" Mark asked, nervous and eager not to start wandering off into the darkened depths of the house. Henry turned back, shrugging. \"The stairs up to the fourth floor are down this hall. You scared, Mark?\" Mark glowered at the mocking smile on his cousin's face; Henry was clearly daring him to chicken out and run for it. Fraidy-cat, fraidy-cat, chicken-guts fraidy-cat! The thought leaped into Mark's mind, unbidden, and he defiantly set his jaw and started down the hallway himself. Be damned if he was gonna let Henry get the best of him this easy. Fleetwood Hall was just a big, empty old house. With a very weird architect behind it, and a bit of a penchant for eating people. The Evans Family House of Horrors! Mark thought crazily, and a nervous laugh escaped him before he could clap a hand over his mouth. \"What's funny?\" Henry asked, glancing at his cousin strangely. \"Oh, nothing,\" Mark giggled. \"Let's just go.\" Henry gave Mark another odd look, but walked on into the house. Now and then they would pass a room, and behind its closed door Mark could see the sun shining in, and the wind howling outside. It had definitely picked up speed since they had gone in. At the very least Mark was grateful for that; it was quite a few miles back to Susan and Wallace's house across town. \"Mark, why do most people feel bad when they do things- like, hurt somebody?\" Mark slowed his step, looking curiously at his cousin. But Henry's eyes held no mockery, no contempt- this was, quite possibly, the first time Mark had heard Henry ask a question and be genuinely interested in hearing the answer. \"What do you mean?\" Mark asked, not quite sure of what Henry was getting at. Henry responded, \"Well, I mean, like if something happens to your brother… if he gets hurt… you're supposed to be sad, right?\" Mark walked along, nodding a little. \"Yeah, of course. That's a terrible thing.\" Henry nodded, seeming a little lost in his own thoughts. \"Yeah,\" Henry said after a few moments of silence, \"Real terrible. Real sad.\" Then he glanced over at his cousin, that curiosity coming back into his eyes again. \"So why don't I feel sad, Mark?\" Now it was Mark's turn to stare. \"Huh?\" Henry shrugged, for once having trouble finding the words. \"I- well, I don't know. I just don't feel sad very much.\" Mark was intrigued by the statement; Henry seemed almost as if he was trying to explain something he didn't fully understand- and it clearly baffled Henry that such a thing was even possible. So smart, so sure of his own wit and ability, Henry reacted with a sort of baffled fury whenever something surprised him or defied his understanding. \"Well, what do you feel?\" Mark asked after a moment. It was a good response, as good as he could come up with right now. Henry walked along beside his cousin, looking a little shy as he dropped his eyes to the floor. \"Not much.\" Mark looked at his cousin, unsure of what to say. This was a lot to take in at once. What was Henry trying to say here? Was he just revealing something, and not really making any special point at all? Henry often seemed to have little specific goal in things he did. He just… did things. Because he felt like it. Suddenly, as they continued walking the length of the seemingly-endless hallway, Henry glanced over at his cousin again. \"What's love, Mark?\" Mark looked sharply at Henry, trying to see if he was being made fun of, but again, Henry gazed back with that curious look on his face. He really wanted to know. \"Well,\" Mark began slowly, \"It's hard to explain. You feel very emotional about somebody, but it's in a good way. Because you really, really care about them.\" Henry continued walking down the hallway, and for some reason Mark was grateful for the conversation. It made him feel less afraid, less inclined to think he'd made a mistake by even entering the house in the first place. Whatever presence the house had- if indeed Mark wasn't just imagining it- it seemed to weaken, draw back into the darker shadows, when Henry and Mark were talking, both their minds off the house and its bizarre history. For a few moments, Henry was silent, apparently deep in thought. \"Hmm. You know what's strange, Mark?\" \"What?\" \"I've heard that before. I can say the words; I mean, I can say 'I love you', but they're just words to me.\" Mark found this hard to believe; even Henry, strange as he could be, had to be able to understand things like love and sorrow. They were just part of the normal range of human emotions; everybody had the capacity for them. Or- maybe some didn't. Maybe some people had something… missing. Like Henry. \"You mean you can't feel love?\" Mark asked, finding this incredible. It was a lot to take in, and Henry was being so calm, so dispassionate about it. It was like he was reading from a textbook, slowing now and then as he became frustrated over not knowing the meaning of all the words. Not truly understanding. Henry just shrugged. \"I don't know, Mark. Maybe I don't. But,\" he went on, \"I don't worry about it like I used to.\" They walked; the hallway just went on and on. Mark glanced behind him, and nearly tripped over his own feet when he saw how far they'd gone. The start of this hallway looked like it was a hundred yards away. Suddenly, Henry halted, turning to his right and lifting a painting off the wall. It was a large, golden-framed illustration of some very old, very big- and of course expensive- roadster. The car had a two-tone paint job of maroon and silver, with a long hood that no doubt concealed many cylinders. Henry grunted as he lifted the picture, carefully setting it down against the wall. Mark recoiled, briefly seized by a terrible certainty that he did not want to see whatever was under there. In any other house, he'd expect just more wood paneling and wallpaper. But here… All there was, though, was more wallpaper, a slightly paler green-gray. There was a square metal door covering something, though; it resembled a very old fuse box. Or maybe it was the master switch for the house's lighting, whatever powered it. Henry went to work on the switches, flipping some and ignoring others. Mark briefly wondered how in the hell the lights were supposed to come on if the power bill probably hadn't been paid in years, but with a quiet growl-hiss sound, gas lamps flared to life along the hallway. Shutting the door covering the switches again, Henry smiled at Mark and bent to pick up the picture. After replacing the painting, he motioned to Mark, and onward they went. \"How'd you know that was there?\" Mark asked, amazed- and much more at ease, now that he wasn't steadily walking into a darker hallway. Henry just shrugged. \"I told you I've been here before.\" \"Doesn't this place bother you?\" Henry looked at Mark oddly, as if he really had no idea what his cousin was talking about. \"What? Why would it?\" Mark just looked back at Henry, shrugging uneasily. \"It's big, and dark, and creepy. This place would be a great haunted house.\" Henry just laughed. Before Mark could say anything else, though, Henry suddenly spun to the right, putting a hand on one of the many doors lining the hall. \"What's along here?\" Mark asked, glancing up and down the hall curiously. The wood paneling and wallpaper was tastefully done, and had held up well over the years. But with so many doors- and no windows- what purpose did this incredibly long hallway serve? It was even bigger than the largest hotel Mark had been to. Half the town he lived in back in Arizona could have stayed on this hallway, were the doors all to bedrooms. Henry glanced back at Mark. \"Oh, lots of things. Bedrooms, storage closets, drawing rooms, painting rooms, an extra kitchen.\" Henry paused, amusement twinkling in his eyes. \"Some of the doors go absolutely nowhere.\" Mark stared, incredulous. \"Nowhere? At all?\" Henry nodded. \"Great-Aunt Eleanor wanted it that way. She wanted things to be… more than they appeared.\" Henry considered. \"Or less.\" Mark paused; a very important question had suddenly occurred to him. \"Why didn't your parents ever talk about this place?\" Henry shrugged. \"I'm not sure.\" Mark had a feeling his cousin was lying. For the moment, though, he put that aside. Mark looked at the door Henry had taken an interest in. \"I wanna get going here. How about that door?\" \"Yeah,\" Henry said, \"This one goes somewhere.\" Henry swung the door open slowly, dramatically, grinning a little in… anticipation. Of what? Before Mark could even question that, Henry swung the door wide open- it was almost completely black in there, but Mark could see the outlines of a spiraling staircase, going up and up into the darkness- and shoved Mark inside. Mark shouted in surprise, but he spun around too slow, and the door slammed shut, cutting off the sound of Henry's laughter.[Chapter 15] Chapter XV- Quiet Hallways Mark pounded furiously on the closed door; he was angry, furious even. Henry had tricked him- again! If he ever caught up to him… Mark yelled and pounded, pounded and yelled- but nothing happened. If Henry could hear Mark, he was ignoring him. And there was always the possibility that Henry couldn't hear him at all- these heavy old doors were far from cheap. Finally, Mark turned around, groping about and wishing for his eyes to hurry up and adjust to the dark. His hands, after a few moments, felt the stairs, found the railing. He looked up- distantly, far above, Mark could make out the outline of the top of the staircase- or maybe that was just as far as his eyes could see. If this staircase went as far as the fourth floor, Mark could believe it. It looked like the stairs went a lot farther than that. Standing there in the dark, Mark grew very still. He could hear things. Nothing specific- nothing you could put your finger on, not at first. But if it was 'just the wind' as people liked to say, now and then it sounded like the wind had learned to talk. If you listened, you could almost hear the words. Mark froze at the base of the stairs; he could barely even tell how big a room this was. Where was he? He tried the knob of the door he'd been pushed through, but couldn't get it to turn. Suddenly, a hand fell on Mark's shoulder. Mark could have jumped ten feet in the air, easily. He screamed, spinning around. A flashlight suddenly flicked on, blinding him. \"Aah!\" Mark cried, and Henry's mocking laughter answered him. \"Hey, come on! This isn't funny!\" Mark yelled, but Henry just chuckled as he lowered the flashlight, aiming it down at the floor. \"Funny?\" Henry's voice was lazy, amused. \"What do you think this is, Mark? A game?\" Then the light was off again, and as Mark stumbled around, trying to follow Henry with his eyes now completely blinded to the dark, he could hear his cousin racing up the flights of stairs. Grabbing hold of the railing, Mark raced after him, tripping and banging his knees or even his chin more times than he'd have cared for. \"Henry!\" Mark cried, both scared and furious. \"Wait up!\" \"Come on, Mark!\" Henry called back, now sounding eager- so eager, in fact, that he just couldn't wait up at all. \"Come on, the library's up this way!\" Mark cursed furiously, but kept staggering up the spiraling flights of steps after Henry. He passed a landing, carpeted of course and with a single door facing him. Opposite that door, there was another landing that led to a blank stretch of wall. This process was repeated, over and over, until- Mark, so focused on his fast climb up the stairs, never even looked up after he got used to it. Suddenly, he smacked into something as he reached the third landing up. Or was it the fourth? Regardless, Mark rebounded, just barely catching himself on the railing. Had he missed it, he might have rolled back down the steps for a very long time. \"Watch it there, Mark,\" Henry's voice said, lazy but admonishing too. \"Gotta be careful. Seems like the lights don't work in here.\" Making his way up onto the landing and sitting down to catch his breath, Mark glared up at Henry. \"Where'd you get that flashlight? How'd you even get in here?\" Then he jumped up, and shoved Henry hard. \"And don't you ever throw me in a dark room like that again!\" Henry just smiled. \"Good, Mark. You wanna be the one in charge, huh?\" \"Damn right I do!\" Bitter and angry, the words were out of Mark's mouth before he could even think about it. He paused, briefly startled. He'd never talked like that before. Henry turned to the door near them. \"That door's a fake,\" he said. \"Try it.\" Glowering at Henry still, Mark rose and walked the ten feet or so across the carpeted landing. Confidently, he set his hand on the doorknob- the brass device turned easily, functioning well even nearly a hundred years later. Mark pulled back the door- -and saw wallpaper. Stunned, he looked back at Henry, whose face was lit from below by the flashlight he had aimed at the floor. It made Henry look even creepier than he normally was. \"Surprised?\" Mark shook his head. \"So where's the real door?\" Henry walked across the stairs, over to the blank wall. He ran his hands along it, searching for something. \"There,\" he said, pointing at a seemingly ordinary section of the wallpaper, pointing with his finger. \"Push that with your hand.\" Mark walked over, glancing at the wall. \"It's just wallpaper,\" he said, really starting to wish he could just bail out of this whole thing. But they were a long way into the house now. If Mark decided to leave, he might not do so well getting out. No, he was probably going to have to see this through. Henry motioned at the wall again, tracing a circle with his finger. \"Go on,\" was all he said. Finally, Mark did as he was told. He set his left hand within the spot Henry had pointed to, giving it a good, solid push. Chunk! The 'wall' swung back, revealing a disguised section that was the true, functional door. Mark didn't know whether to be terrified or amazed. This house had been built by someone whose imaginative powers far exceeded the ordinary. It was as if Dr. Seuss had been able to design a house, one that in no way had to make sense or be practical. And yet… on the outside at least, it did. Another long, stretching hallway; this one, dimly lit by the gas lamps, had a different twist from the last. All the lamps were on the floor, and the carpeting was on the ceiling. It was a perfect reversal of an ordinary hallway- even the paintings hung upside down, and a few marble statues were held to the ceiling somehow. \"Wow,\" Mark said, awed in spite of himself. \"Yeah,\" Henry said, stepping into the hallway, his winter boots scraping on the maroon-painted 'ceiling'. \"Come on,\" Mark said, \"Let's hurry up and see this library of yours.\" Suddenly, Mark stared right at his cousin. \"Doesn't this place scare you?\" he said suddenly, shivering in the musty, cool air. He could imagine, with startling certainty, that even the individual molecules of air had stayed right in the same place in so many of these rooms and hallways. Somehow, Mark was very sure that all this and more had been- and yet, somehow, the house did not feel like a dead, empty place that had lain untouched and motionless for decades. It felt more like a person would, as they began to wake up from a long nap. Henry shook his head. \"I never learned how to be afraid, Mark. It doesn't get me anything.\" They walked down the reversed hallway, rounding a corner where suddenly everything was right again. As they walked, Mark suddenly began growing very nervous again. The further he went into these darkened halls, the harder it would be if he suddenly had to get out. Whether or not the Glass Library was truly down this way, Mark had an eerie feeling that Henry knew exactly where they were, knew that Mark on his own would be hopelessly lost… and was counting on that. For what? Just as Mark was about to turn and head for the stairs- perhaps right now, he could still find his way back out- Henry set a hand on Mark's shoulder. \"Mark!\" he said, his face lit with excitement. \"I found it. We're here!\" Henry turned to his right and set his hand on a door, flanked to either side by dimly flaring lamps. He turned the knob and pushed- Mark gasped. The Glass Library was through the opened door, and it was one of the most beautiful rooms Mark had ever seen.[Chapter 16] Chapter XVI- The Glass Library A/N: Remember that the final part of this chapter, in particular, is based off of what happens to George in Stephen King's short story \"Gramma\". Also, note that Henry is still the same kid he's always been, both before the events of this story and after. The way I looked at it, Henry- being a born sociopath- is more than mean enough for Fleetwood Hall's standards. Because of how cold and ruthless Henry is, the house is not a hindrance to him like it is for most people. If anything, the house just makes Henry a little stronger. In spite of his fear, in spite of his unease- and a quiet voice, telling him to back out now before he made a terrible mistake- Mark was awed. The library's floor was entirely reflective glass- mirrors. A white, dome-like ceiling arched high overhead, and white marble lined the walls. High above them, electric lights ringed the ceiling, hidden from sight at the start of the dome's base at the top of the walls of marble. And the books- bookshelves, made entirely of flawless, naturally-dark-green glass, lined the walls, running from Mark's left and right to the far side of the room. Strangely, there were no chairs or sofas anywhere in sight- maybe this library had been designed with visual impressiveness being the highest priority, and practicality taking backstage. Perhaps you were supposed to read the books you found here- there had to be over a thousand- in another room. Henry and Mark walked into the library for a time, gazing down at their own reflections and up at the ceiling, high above. Glancing back, Mark could see Henry had for some reason left the flashlight in the hallway, just outside. \"See,\" Henry said calmly, \"Now was this worth it? Was it really so bad getting lost in the dark for a minute?\" \"Tell me about Richard ,\" Mark said suddenly. His voice was harsh, commanding- he surprised himself even by speaking it. Henry blinked; he hadn't expected this. \"I heard your parents talking,\" Mark said, \"They said he drowned.\" Henry stared back. \"He did.\" \"In six inches of water?\" Now Henry's gaze was turning icy. \"I guess so. I wouldn't know, Mark- I was downstairs playing.\" Suddenly, Mark decided he'd had enough of Henry lying to him. He was done with this nonsense, and he was through with getting lost in this house without even a trail of breadcrumbs to follow back. But before he got out of here, he would see that one question answered. Mark grabbed Henry, seized hold of his winter coat, that pretty tan thing with the nice, white fur lining on the inside. \"Quit lying to me, Henry!\" Mark snapped. \"I wanna hear it. Did you kill Richard?\" Now Henry stared back flatly, his eyes like those of a shark- deadly, cold, and utterly remorseful. Dark, cold things swam beneath the surface of those eyes. Henry's lips began to move, and in a voice hardly above a whisper, he gave a tiny shrug and said, \"What if I did?\" Mark suddenly felt very afraid. His head seemed to clear, and in that instant Mark realised he had made a terrible mistake coming here. He didn't like Henry, and didn't want to be like him. He could already tell his choices, going along with Henry, had really screwed things up. But maybe there was still time! The dark-haired boy let go of his cousin, turning and bolting for the library's door. Henry called after him, but Mark refused to listen. He refused to stop. Beneath his feet, Mark's feet were slowly gaining grip, as if the floor was growing soft. He glanced down, and saw with dawning horror that- somehow- the mirrored glass was turning fluid; his feet were forming ripples as they hit, and sinking in a little more each time. \"I'm gonna give you a head start, Mark,\" Henry's voice called after him. It was lazy, almost unconcerned- like he knew Mark was gonna do this. Maybe he had. By the time Mark finally staggered over to the door, he was sinking into the mirror floor up to his knees. He had to fight for every step; the floor felt like a thick, thick paste. It felt vaguely cold, and yet vaguely warm- as if it was alternating, pulsing with some strange life of its own. The doorway! Mark reached it, hauling himself up and panting hard, grateful to have escaped the horror-show that library had turned out to be. Wasting not even a second, Mark snatched up the flashlight- glancing back for just an instant to see Henry, his hands twisted into claws and a horribly eager look on his face, starting to sprint after him. Mark slammed the door hard and bolted down the hall; he felt a sudden jolt of horror when he realised that, for Henry, the floor was still solid. Henry's run had started out just fine, his boots smacking hard on the smooth mirror floor. But there was no time for thinking about the how and why of that. In fact, there was quite literally no time at all. Mark switched on the flashlight as the gas lamps- of course- cut off, the house turned traitor against him, even though no one could have possibly reached even the switch for this hallway. He sprinted down the hallway, rounding a corner and going back the way he'd come. Fear raced through Mark; as he ran, he had a sudden certainty of why he'd been brought here, what was going to happen if he didn't get away, and get away soon. Henry had discovered something here years ago; an already cold boy had found a way to embrace his coldness, and now wanted a playmate who had the right stuff. Like preparing a chicken to be cooked, you had to prepare the playmate first, test him and ensure he had the right basic criteria. After all, a chicken whose meat was bad would always be that way. Simply putting it in the oven wouldn't quite fix everything. But Mark knew Henry had figured out what would fix the issues his would-be best friend currently had. He didn't feel like hanging around for the final step of the process. Mark ran. His feet pounded down the hall, and he ran faster and more desperately than he'd ever done in his life. He knew what was going to happen, what he just had to do. He would run. He would flee, he would bolt straight through every door that he had to and get out of this awful house. He would run straight out into the approaching night- he and Henry had spent hours in here by now- and run back across Rockbridge. It would be hard, yes- Mark would not have an easy time getting away. But he had no choice. He had to try. Mark had to try because if he didn't, if he stopped or slowed up now, and Henry caught up to him… Terror gripped Mark at what he thought about next. He was not going to die here, and neither was Henry. Somehow, Mark was just very sure of that. If Mark failed, if he did not get away from his cousin now, the two boys would still return home tonight, and Mark would be alive, and Henry too, oh, yes… but Mark would have developed a sudden taste for cigarettes. Cigarettes, crossbows that fired railroad bolts… and never feeling the need to actually say sorry- and mean it. Footsteps behind Mark, thumping hard on the carpeted floor. Mark could see the door the spiraling staircase just ahead of him, perhaps twenty feet away- on this side, illuminated in the flashlight's shining beam, the door was just a door. Mark tried to pour on the speed, tried to dig in his heels and run even harder, but already he was going faster than he'd ever known he could. Sweat poured off him in beads, and he knew even as he closed in on the door- ten feet- that he'd never get his hand on the knob. Wham! Mark's feet suddenly flew out from under him, and he saw stars as he struck the floor and his head hit the flashlight, sending it rolling away. Mark rolled over, gasping and panting hard. Above him, he could see Henry's pale face, flushed from the brief run- but hardly exhausted. Henry had just been getting started. Barely able to speak, Mark tried to crawl backwards, but Henry straddled him with his legs, pinning him down. \"Let me go!\" Mark shouted, pulling in air and renewing his fight. \"Let me go! I'm getting out of here!\" Henry grinned, a warm, angelic smile of a boy who always went to church and looked both ways before he crossed the street. A good son, who had long ago figured out what adults most liked and wanted- and how to look the way he needed to in order to go unnoticed in their world. Only children could easily sense something was off- a thing or two missing, an item out of place. Maybe Susan would have listened, had Mark told her. I should've tried , Mark thought desperately. I should have tried harder. Henry leaned down over Mark, hooking his hands into claws and setting them firmly about Mark's throat. \"You'll get out of here, Mark,\" he whispered, \"But I have to show you the way.\" Mark flailed his arms with fury, striking at Henry as hard and as fast as he could. But none of it seemed to make any difference; none of it seemed to have any effect as Henry began to squeeze, his hands bands of iron around Mark's neck.[Chapter 17] Chapter XVII- The Second Face They had come back late that night; Susan had been growing frantic with worry, and Wallace did his share of yelling once the boys returned, berating them about the importance of coming back on time. It was enough that Connie was in the hospital, and it was more than generous of Wallace and Susan to allow Henry and Mark such freedom in the first place. Wallace was angry- and disappointed- that they would put their family to such worry and abuse it. Henry and Mark took the stern lecture Susan gave them- and Wallace's angry tirade- with bowed heads and quiet apologies, making no effort to argue or protest. Both of them seemed tired, dazed; as if the day's adventures had quite exhausted them, and they had no energy to spare for arguing with parents. Mark was quiet through dinner, but when asked questions he responded clearly, and with confidence. For once, when telling the tale of the day's events came up, Mark did more of the talking than Henry, who looked especially worn out. They'd gone sight-seeing all over town, Mark said, and had even gotten into a few snowball fights. No mention was made of seeing any houses- nothing was said of any huge, old house once owned by somewhat distant relatives. Susan and Wallace made a note to not let the boys wander so far in that direction on their own anymore- but everything seemed fine. Tired as they were, Mark and Henry got along well enough at dinner, and seemed to have even patched up their earlier differences. Henry and Mark both asked about Connie, and appeared relieved when told she was doing fine. The next day, Connie's fifth day in the hospital and closing in on her return home, Mark and Henry calmly assured Wallace and Susan that everything would be fine while they left for dinner. They would remain in the house, keeping an eye on things, and understood that the restaurant's phone number was on the fridge's door. Wallace and Susan left for their first dinner outing in quite a while, feeling very grateful that Mark and Henry were both so at ease with the situation. They were accepting, even eager- perhaps to prove that they could, indeed, be left alone to be in charge. \"They're such good boys,\" Susan said, and Wallace agreed. \"We're lucky to have them.\" Once his parent's car had pulled out of the driveway and its red taillights vanished into the growing darkness, Henry jumped back from the blinds in the living room. \"Come on, Mark!\" he cried, racing upstairs. Mark followed him, interested but curious. \"What?\" Henry reached the main hallway upstairs and pulled down the blinds at the far end of the hall. He looked at Mark, smiling warmly. \"We gotta toughen you up, Mark,\" Henry said. \"I gotta teach you how to fight.\" Mark nodded; he had few reservations about that idea. He'd learned about the karate classes Henry had been taking, and about how Henry could now even beat up bigger kids at school if he wanted. Henry was fast, smart, and mean- and yet if he felt like it, he could be kind and generous. Mark had been feeling a little odd since he'd passed out in that big house earlier in the day- Henry said he'd tripped and hit his head on a flashlight- but he felt better, too. His throat was sore- Mark guessed it was because of all that cold he'd been exposed to. A fierce Maine winter could do all sorts of things you hadn't experienced before. Henry stripped to his khaki pants, and Mark did the same. Facing each other in the hallway, each boy bowed elegantly to the other. Then they advanced, and the fists flew. Mark only knew rough, improvised schoolyard fighting, and even then not much of it. He landed some good blows now and then, but Henry was advancing fast and hard. His fists, clenched just right, struck in calculated blows; as Mark took hit after hit in the chest and ribs, it sounded like Henry was chopping wood. Henry soon drove Mark back towards the window, slamming him up against it. Suddenly, Mark lashed out and caught Henry in the throat; the blonde recoiled, coughing and gagging, and Mark struck out again with a blow to the stomach, chopping Henry to the floor. Mark stood over Henry with a grin on his face. \"Round one, Mark,\" he said, smiling. They went straight on to another five rounds. Henry was a fast-moving, hard-hitting fighter, but Mark could strike out with surprising force. All he needed was to know what he was trying to do. He had to wade into a fight wanting to not just hurt his enemy, but kill him. Henry coached Mark all through their hand-to-hand duels, showing him all manner of moves and tricks. There were feints, acts of deception, and ways to counterattack. Always, Henry urged Mark, keep moving. \"If you stop in a fight, you're dead,\" Henry said simply, shrugging. \"You have to keep going.\" They were on round seven- it was 3-3, much to Henry's surprise- when the Evans elders got home. Mark, sweating furiously, had driven a panting Henry over to the top of the stairs. He had knocked Henry down, and planted a foot on his cousin's chest. \"I could break your nose now,\" Mark gloated, somehow delighting in the fact that he'd knocked his superior, high-and-mighty cousin down yet again. It felt good to be winning fights for once. It felt good to be learning how to do it. Henry just shrugged. \"Go ahead,\" he said calmly. \"Smash my nose. You gotta stomp pretty hard, though. There's gonna be blood everywhere.\" He almost sounded like he wanted to see it. Mark grinned, thinking about indulging his cousin's request. \"Mark!\" \"Henry!\" Wallace and Susan had just come in the front door, and were looking up from the base of the stairs. To say the least, they looked very shocked. Immediately, both boys stopped what they were doing. Mark helped Henry to his feet, and both boys came down the stairs, smiling sheepishly as they came. \"I'm sorry, Mom,\" Henry said, looking suitably abashed. \"We were just fighting.\" Susan looked stunned. \"Just fighting ? Henry, when did I ever -\" \"It's okay, Aunt Susan,\" Mark said, setting an arm around his cousin's bare shoulders and squeezing a little. He smiled warmly, and Henry smiled back. \"Henry was giving me some karate lessons,\" Mark said. \"The hallway upstairs had room.\" Finally, Susan and Wallace sighed, mostly out of relief that the two had not been actually trying to beat each other up. \"Not so rough, okay, fellas?\" Wallace said. \"And if you want to practice like that, I got some boxing gloves in the basement. Both of you were probably gonna have bruises tomorrow.\" Susan added, \"And no fighting anywhere but the basement, in the carpeted play room down there. We don't need you breaking anything up here, and on these hard wood floors, one of you could get hurt.\" Mark and Henry nodded, almost in unison. Wallace and Susan couldn't help but smile a little; it was nice to see them clicking so well. In the past day or two, especially, the two had started doing so much together, they seemed to be acting like brothers. And Henry, for his part, no longer seemed jealous of any extra attention Mark or Connie might get. With Mark for a friend, he seemed content with everything- and, as Susan recalled, he and Mark must have had some very pointed discussions about Connie before now. Mark, somehow, had set Henry straight on a few things. Henry even took some time to come down to the living room that night- now in his pajamas, back to being fully clothed- to apologise for the accident a few days ago, and for not doing more to keep Connie safe. Wallace and Susan were surprised, but pleased, to hear such calm, mature talk from their son. Henry was explaining what he felt he'd done wrong, and promising to do better in the future. Both his parents thanked Henry for coming to talk to them, and sent him back upstairs feeling much better about things. Even Susan felt her recent doubts starting to slip away- Mark was such a wonderful boy, and he was clearly showing Henry, already a good son, how to be better. Maybe that was it- perhaps that was the issue all along. Maybe Henry had just needed someone his own age to show him how to care about his sister. Susan was startled, though, when she got upstairs later that night and saw Mark standing at the far end of the hall, leaning against the doorway to Henry's darkened room. It was a little odd that Mark was still up, but what was stranger still was the look she spotted on his face when she first looked at him. There one moment and gone the next, the look so surprised Susan she went to bed that night sure she'd imagined it. She'd been seeing things with Henry, maybe- but even that didn't seem to be true. No way could anything like that be possible with Mark. But in that one moment, that single instant before Mark realised Susan could see him, he had the strangest smile on his face, the oddest gleam twinkling in his eyes. It was almost contemptuous. Almost a smirk. ","Summary":" CHAPTER I- The Bridge Henry crossed the road behind him. \"Aw, Mr. Righteous Goody Two-Shoes.\" Mar"},{"Movie":"Good Son","Title":"The Evil Angel","Author":"90TheGeneral09","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9216162","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter I- Brothers Parting It was 3:55 in the afternoon; Mark Evans was supposed to have left his Uncle Wallace and Aunt Susan's house at 3:00, when his father Jack had gotten here. There was a very simple reason why they hadn't left yet; Mark was stalling. These two weeks had just gone by too fast- it was unfair. Mark hadn't felt so cheated by Father Time in years, perhaps in his whole life. Consumed with grief- and self-doubt and blame- over the passing of his mother after months of illness, he'd had to see his father leave too, going off to Japan on a business trip he couldn't put off or avoid. But things had changed. Mark, alone and quite miserable, had experienced a wonderful thing. He'd made a friend. Henry Evans, Mark's blonde-haired, ice-blue-eyed cousin from Rockbridge, Maine, was a boy who took some getting used to. He was wise and insightful far beyond his years, strong due to his love for regular exercise. Henry could be kind and generous if he chose, but he was harsh and unforgiving to anyone who crossed him. Early on, Mark had begun to worry about Henry, not at all comfortable with the views he began sharing with Mark- or the way Henry liked to have fun most of the time. He was meaner than hell when he wanted to be; Henry was like no other twelve-year-old boy Mark had ever met. But he didn't worry about that, the way he used to. Mark wasn't quite sure what had happened; Henry said Mark fell and struck his head while they were exploring the cavernous interior of Fleetwood Hall, a titanic estate that stood alone and ignored in the gentle foothills at Rockbridge's western outskirts, Rockbridge itself being part of the outer Portland area. Mark figured he must have taken a pretty good fall; even now he remembered next to nothing of the experience. But Mark did know that Henry had taken care of him; when Mark woke up, they were back in the grand entrance hall, Mark propped up on an ancient leather couch off to one side of the enormous room. Henry was sitting on the floor, arms crossed and held tight to his chest as he shivered, watching Mark; the darker-haired of the two cousins had been lying there on the couch for some time, wearing both his and Henry's winter jackets. They'd made their way home soon after that, Henry brushing off Mark's thanks rather shyly. Slipping under the imperious wrought-iron front gates just as they'd come in, Henry and Mark began the hour-long walk across town to get back home. During that walk, they'd walked and talked, gradually coming to feel such warm companionship that they barely noticed the cold. Henry kept asking Mark if he was all right, and Mark at least once had to ask that of Henry; his blonde-haired cousin had looked unusually tired, almost drained by the experience. He brushed it off when Mark asked, but the dark-haired boy ended up assuming that Henry had been forced to carry Mark all the way back to the front doors from the Glass Library on the fourth floor of Fleetwood Hall. That certainly explained it; carrying someone over your shoulders that far would tire anybody. The two boys got home well after dark; Henry didn't say just how long they'd been at the house, or how long Mark had been out- but he did say \"a while\", and the way he said it, Mark got a sense the delay had been more than thirty minutes. Wallace and Susan were both up, pacing the living room floor and anxiously waiting for the boys' return. When the two had knocked at the front door, Wallace had been angry enough that he yelled at Henry and Mark for making their parents- and aunt and uncle- worry so much. The two boys had hung their heads, said their apologies, and true to their word never been late like that again during Mark's visit. That last week had gone by so fast. Mark hadn't had so much fun in years, and he felt closer to Henry- more like one of the brothers Henry had said they could be- every day. They would spend hours going places together- visiting the rail yard that passed through town, going down to the nearby district of Rockport and watching the fishing boats go out and come in, smoking cigarettes where the adults couldn't see them, and so much more. Mark and Henry even went to work on the treehouse out back with a passion, finishing it and even setting up plans to install removable plastic 'windows' and perhaps even a door. It took many hours of hard work out in the cold, but it was worth it. It was the best damn tree house Mark or Henry had ever seen. They might not be using it much in the coming years; the boys would be turning 13 soon, and it would all just be uphill from there. No more playing childish games or smoking in the treehouse; they'd be in the big leagues then. Driving, drinking, fucking, shoving nerds out of their way in the halls- the more Mark and Henry talked about it, the more they looked forward to it. All they needed to do was wait. They had no reason to believe they'd be any stronger or faster than the boys around them at school; no way of knowing just when puberty's changes would begin. But there was always a way of getting what you wanted; Mark understood that now. Henry had told him all about it, proving yet again how knowledge truly was power. But today was the end of Mark's stay at his cousin's house; the end of something very good. He felt like he'd only just truly met Henry, and now he had to leave. It just wasn't fair. Mark sighed as he zipped up the duffel bag he was taking with him; Henry, using his persuasive skills to the fullest, had convinced his parents to take them out shopping; Mark now owned a whole set of new clothes, the best he'd ever owned. While Mark had stayed at home to watch Connie another afternoon of Mark's final week in Maine, Henry had gone out with his father to get Mark's presents for Christmas. Mark was of course not allowed to see what had been found for him, but Henry promised Mark he'd get a real present from his cousin before leaving. That time seemed to have come. Mark was just finishing zipping up the emerald green sports duffel bag when Henry tapped him on the shoulder; his cousin was superbly dressed in a ruby red sweater and khaki pants. He was smiling warmly. \"Here,\" he said, handing Mark a small wooden box. \"I got two of 'em. So we can be brothers.\" Mark smiled as he took the box Henry was holding out; he remembered that moment, too. Henry had given him a white plaster mask when they'd first met, telling him those very words. It amazed Mark how in just two weeks, those words already rang true. \"Well, go on,\" Henry chuckled, seeing Mark space out a bit as he thought back and remembered. \"Open it.\" The darker-haired boy did, taking the cover off and gasping a little as he saw what lay underneath. \"Early Christmas present, Mark,\" Henry said. \"Merry Christmas.\" \"Merry Christmas,\" Mark breathed, barely above a whisper. Inside the box, lying in imprints made in a rectangle of dark, velvet-like padding were two identical black-handled knives. Henry adroitly snatched one up, pointed it away from himself and pressed a small button; with a sharp snick a blade that had to be six inches in length snapped out. Mark stared, entranced; the blade's steel gleamed like a mirror. There wasn't a spot or a flaw to be found; Mark had never seen anything so beautiful. Henry wisely folded his up and pocketed it, then placed the cover of the box back on Mark's; he could hear somebody coming up the stairs. Small feet, light and bounding; Henry frowned in annoyance. Connie. \"Henry! Mark!\" Connie chirped, halting at the doorway. \"What?\" Henry said neutrally, moving towards his sister as Mark placed that last item in his bag, zipping it closed again. \"Dad says Uncle Jack's ready to go; you guys need to come down soon!\" \"We're coming,\" Henry said dismissively, already turning away. Connie paused uncertainly; these two had been stalling for a while now, and Jack really did need to get going. Maine to Arizona was a three-day drive at the very least; not something you wanted to start at the end of the day. \"Make sure Mark and Henry get down here,\" was what Wallace had said. And yet it looked like the two boys were gonna try to stall for time again. \"But Dad said-\" Connie said, starting to object. Henry cut her off. \"Listen,\" he said, an edge of steel coming into his voice, \"I said we'll be down there. Just wait.\" Connie crossed her arms and pouted. \"We've been waiting!\" \"He said, wait! So wait !\" Mark snapped, looking over at her impatiently. The blonde-haired girl stared; Mark had never talked like that before. She looked from one boy's face to the next, from Henry's cold blue eyes to Mark's gray-blue ones, which held a sternness she'd never noticed before. She glanced from one boy's face to the other, and for the first time realised she couldn't tell which was which. The eyes were similar in colour, held the same ill-concealed look of annoyance, and their expressions were set to match. \"Fine!\" Connie said, turning and bounding back down the stairs. She'd come up there and told those two what she was supposed to tell them. Let them get in trouble with Mom and Dad if they wanted to! Back in Henry's room, Mark's cousin sighed. \"I guess we better go, man,\" he said reluctantly. \"Dad's gonna have a fit if we're up here much longer.\" \"Yeah,\" Mark nodded. \"Guess so.\" Then he smirked a bit. \"Can't have that, right?\" \"No indeed,\" Henry replied, that same sly smile on his lips. He enjoyed these moments between himself and Mark; it was like they understood each other so well these days, words were sometimes just a formality. Neither of them much cared if the adults downstairs got annoyed at their delaying or not; neither Mark nor Henry had expected they'd enjoy these past two weeks so much, but all things had to end. Unfortunately. Finally, Henry started for the stairs, picking up Mark's backpack as his cousin hefted the duffel. \"Come on, brother ,\" Henry said with a smile. \"Let's go. They're waiting for us.\" As they made their way down the stairs, Henry turned slightly to Mark, eyeing him and judging the distance carefully- then he kicked his cousin behind the left knee, letting out an almost theatrical \"Whoops!\" as Mark toppled and fell on the duffel bag. But Mark, not to be outdone, threw himself into a roll, tumbling right on down the stairs and towards Henry, pulling the surprised blonde down with him. \"Mark! Henry!\" Susan cried, hurrying towards the stairs and then backing away as the tangled mess of boys and luggage came tumbling down the stairs towards her. Jack and Wallace, having been sitting across from each other in the living room nearby, turned their heads at the sound, then jumped up and hurried over. They stopped abruptly, though, and in spite of themselves couldn't help but smile. The two boys were rolling around on the landing, wrestling amidst Mark's dropped bags and laughing. \"See, Jack?\" Wallace said quietly, smiling a little. \"I told you a few weeks here would do him some good. He's doing fine.\" Jack gazed down at his son and nephew as they wrestled on the landing; alternately growling with mock fierceness and laughing, they hadn't been bothered by the fall down the stairs a bit. There'd be a few bruises later, perhaps, but neither twelve-year-old seemed to mind. They were boys, and right now held a passing resemblance to a couple of wolf cubs. Jack found the comparison startling; Mark had always been so gentle and passive. Now he looked like he was enjoying the playful physical battle with Henry. It wasn't a side of Mark that Jack was used to. But maybe this was a result of Mark's stay with Henry, who Jack remembered was a bit more of a fighter, a boy who sometimes liked trading punches as a show of affection. Maybe meeting Henry and spending time with him had brought that out in Mark; in any case, it was something Jack was glad to see. Mark was laughing like he did years ago; before Janice had started her slow, steady decline and finally- just weeks ago still- passed away. It had been a terrible blow to Jack, and to Mark, and Jack had seen it troubling Mark enough that he had truly wished that he didn't have to leave on his business trip to Japan. Two weeks later, though, Jack saw his son, lively and cheerful, tumbling down a flight of stairs with his cousin and wrestling with him playfully at the bottom. They had probably been having the time of their lives these two weeks; just like Wallace had said. Jack felt a rush of gratitude towards Wallace and Susan- and to Henry, for so eagerly befriending Mark and doing so much to bring his old self back again. Not even that; Jack could have sworn his son was actually somehow more than he was before. Stronger, more alive. Maybe it was just the stark contrast of the subdued, withdrawn way he'd been two weeks ago after the funeral to the way he was now. Jack was very glad now he'd taken Wallace and Susan's offer; clearly, in leaving Mark with them, he'd done the right thing. \"All right, boys,\" Susan said, moving in and gently but firmly separating them. \"What'd I tell you? Not so rough! You're going to have bruises tonight, Henry! Mark; you, too!\" The two boys stood, still laughing a little. \"Sorry, Mom,\" Henry said, promptly becoming contrite. \"We were just having fun.\" Mark nodded, grinning and panting. \"Let's do that again!\" Susan shook her head, trying hard to be stern but letting a smile through even so. \"Boys,\" she said, and Henry bowed elegantly. \"We are, Mom. And just think! We'll be teenagers soon.\" All three adults in the entrance hall of the house groaned in perfect unison, making the two boys just smile wider. \"Don't remind me,\" Wallace said with a mock-pained expression. \"When Henry was eleven he wrecked my best camera. Pretty soon he's gonna be wrecking my car .\" \"Wallace,\" Susan said, \"Do you wanna give them ideas?\" \"What?\" Wallace said, feigning confusion. \"Did I say something I shouldn't?\" Mark turned and hefted his bags; Henry again insisted on taking one, now slinging the heavier duffel bag over his shoulder and standing ready to take it out to his Uncle Jack's car. Mark looked towards Jack. \"I'm ready to go, Dad.\" \"You sure?\" Jack asked; Mark looked like he didn't quite want to leave. But Mark nodded, and he appeared remarkably sure of himself. Like he didn't want to leave- but knew he had to. \"Yeah,\" Mark said, and Jack began his goodbyes. \"Wallace,\" he said, \"Susan, I can't thank either of you enough for stepping in and helping me and Mark at a… at a time like this.\" Jack had some trouble continuing there; even thinking about his wife still greatly troubled him; it hadn't even been a month yet. The wounds hadn't yet had time to heal. But Susan and Wallace were the picture of understanding. \"It was our pleasure,\" Susan said, meaning every word. \"Mark's been great.\" \"You needed us, Jack,\" Wallace said, looking at his brother with sympathy. \"You and Janice would have done the same for us; I know it. I just wish we could've done more.\" Jack shook hands with his brother. \"Believe me,\" he said with a smile and a glance at Mark, \"I think you've helped plenty. Mark seems to have had a great time.\" \"He sure did,\" Susan smiled, \"He's welcome back anytime.\" Both boys looked very pleased to hear that. \"Connie!\" Jack called, looking at the six-year-old girl in the jeans and sweater who'd been standing next to her mother, observing the proceedings in silence- and throwing Henry a dirty look when she thought nobody was looking. She hurried over to her Uncle Jack, though, who swept her up and hugged her. \"Thanks for looking after Mark, Connie,\" Jack said. \"Welcome, Uncle Jack!\" Connie chirped. She glanced at her mother while Jack held her. \"Mom, can we go to Arizona sometime?\" \"We might,\" Susan said. She glanced at Jack. \"Of course, Uncle Jack and Mark are always welcome to visit us.\" Jack smiled, gently kneeling to let Connie down. \"I think we will sometime,\" he said. Finally, the moment arrived. \"Come on, Mark,\" Jack said, turning for the door. \"Let's get going. Arizona's quite a drive away.\" Jack was a little surprised at how Henry so promptly trailed out the door after them, lugging Mark's duffel bag with the occasional grunt as the three walked to Jack's tan Jeep Wrangler. \"Thanks again for helping Mark pick out all those clothes, Henry,\" Jack said as they went. \"That was real nice of you.\" \"I was glad to,\" Henry said. He seemed to really mean it. Jack shivered at the biting cold, in spite of his winter jacket; as he unlocked the back door of the Wrangler's narrow cargo area, he marveled again at his brother's choice of residence; Maine was a tough place to live in the winter. Arizona was a world apart from it. The two bags were promptly stowed, and Jack took out the Jeep's keys again, jingling them a little as a subtle way of letting the boys know that time had finally come. Mark and Henry faced each other by the back of the Jeep, locking eyes and regarding one another solemnly. Henry smiled warmly, putting out a hand. \"See you, brother.\" Mark took Henry's hand- and pulled him forward, gripping him in a tight bear-hug. Henry followed suit, and the two boys stood that way for some time. Jack, standing nearby, found himself fearing for the boys' ribs. Finally, the two separated. Henry took of his tan winter coat, the one lined with white fur on the inside. It was his favourite, and he was handing it to Mark now. \"Here,\" Henry said. \"For the trip back.\" Surprised and pleased, Mark smiled back. \"Thanks!\" \"Henry,\" Jack said uncertainly, \"Are you sure about this?\" Henry nodded. He was sure. \"I can get another one,\" he said. Finally, they could delay no longer. With one more tight, bone-crushing hug, the boys said their farewells. Mark climbed into the passenger seat of his Dad's Jeep, looking back to wave at Wallace, Susan and Connie, who had come out on the front porch of the house. Then he looked back at Henry, amazed as his cousin stood on the layer of snow covering the lawn, the wind whipping around him and undoubtedly slicing clean through his gray wool pants and Ruby red sweater. Henry must have been freezing out there, but he stood rooted to the spot as his Uncle Jack started the Jeep's engine and drove away, waving from the driveway until the very last moment, when the Jeep finally disappeared from sight. Driving back down Chamberlain Drive and towards the interstate, Jack largely stayed silent, as he was preoccupied with making sure he got his directions right. The drive back to Arizona would take long enough as it is, even if Jack didn't miss any of the key highway and route entrances and exits. But Jack did look at Mark now and then; he hadn't seen him for two weeks, and after leaving him in Maine to go on that business trip to Japan, Jack wanted to make up for last time any way that he could. Much like he'd been on the trip up to Maine two weeks ago, Mark didn't say much, seeming rather withdrawn. But the Gameboy he'd buried himself in for half the trip out to Maine was in one of his bags, stowed away and uncalled for. Instead, Mark gazed out the passenger window, watching the snow and ice-covered Maine landscape pass by, as if committing it to memory. \"How we doing, Mark?\" Jack said as they turned onto the highway entrance ramp. If nothing else, he wanted to see how Mark would respond. Two weeks ago, Mark probably would have grunted or muttered some noncommittal response. But today, he just gave a slight shrug, glancing over at his dad and smiling a little. \"All right,\" he said. \"Have a good time staying up here with Uncle Wallace and everybody?\" Now Mark really did smile, a warm and cheerful smile that easily reached his eyes. \"Yeah,\" Mark said, thinking of his cousin, his new friend Henry. \"Yeah, I had a great time.\" \"Great,\" Jack said, grinning back, so pleased was he at the look of calm and contentment he saw on Mark's face. Today he'd been taken aback by seeing Mark laughing and playing with Henry- after losing Janice, Jack had begun to worry if he'd hear Mark laugh ever again. But Mark had been laughing- and it was real laughter, the sound of a cheerful, happy boy. The things Jack had seen today brought him a great deal of peace; a sense that, in a way, maybe leaving Mark for these two weeks had been just what the both of them needed. Jack's business was doing better than ever, the deal with the Japanese firm solidly in hand. Wallace had confided over the phone that he was doing some damn good deals on the stock market lately; before long, Wallace said, he would have as much as a 5% stake in Chrysler Corporation. With the bold, dynamic leadership of new CEO David Parr, Chrysler was really headed somewhere, starting to put real emphasis on quality again and leaving the misguided choices of the 80's behind them. The two men of the family were doing just fine; both Jack and Wallace were moving up steadily in their business careers. Well, really, Wallace had about all he needed; he was just advancing things a little at a time, ensuring a permanently prosperous future for his family. Jack- he was on his way to that. He could tell. And Mark? Jack's thoughts came back to his son in a hurry, but surprisingly, as they began the drive back down the interstate and on to Arizona, Jack didn't feel very guilty for letting his mind drift towards his and his brother's business careers. The Evans brothers had both suffered tragedy, suffered loss. Just weeks ago, Jack had lost his wife; Wallace, two years ago, had lost his son. But now, things were going right again. And Mark… Jack cast a glance at Mark, who, seeming a little worn out by his battle with Henry and the two weeks he'd spent exploring a whole new world- for that's what Maine was to Mark- with his cousin, had leaned up against the doorframe and fallen asleep. He was comfortably wrapped in Henry's beautiful and expensive winter coat, using the fur liner of its concealable hood as a pillow. A few strands of Mark's wavy brown hair hung over his face, which looked calm and fully at peace. He's doing great , Jack thought happily, adjusting the Jeep's heater a little and keeping two steady hands on his driving. My son's doing fine .[Chapter 2] Chapter II- Back Home The drive back to Arizona had taken about three days, just as Jack had figured; it was an impressive pace given how many states they had to pass through, just like before. Mark didn't seem to mind much. Throughout the drive, he asked about museums along the way, about landmarks and tourist attractions he hadn't seen before- and might not get to see again. The trip had been the same number of miles, taken the same amount of days and hours, more or less. Yet somehow, Jack returned home to Arizona feeling like they'd done it in half the time. The difference was not in the mileage driven, or the hours passed; Jack had even taken pretty much the same route back that he'd taken up to Maine in the first place. The difference wasn't in any of those things. Mark was back. That was the difference. Jack observed Mark over the first week they spent back, marveled at how he had taken such strides in putting his mother's passing behind him. It would not have surprised or even bothered Jack had his son been in mourning longer- Jack knew it would be far more than two weeks before he'd make any real progress with putting Janice's passing behind him. But Jack had no complaints about the steps Mark had made. He had no objections to having a lively, cheerful Mark back again. No , Jack thought more than once, No complaints there. That's just fine with me . But then the day came; it had been four weeks- one month to the day- since Janice Evans' death. The time came for Jack and Mark to go place flowers at Janice's grave. Mark didn't want to go. Jack was quite surprised at that; he knew Mark had made some progress in dealing with his mother's passing, and was thankful for it. Mark had been worryingly depressed over it before; now he displayed an almost equally worrying reluctance to go out with his father to pay respects to his mother. He'd been at the funeral, of course- Mark wouldn't have missed that for anything. But when Jack asked if he'd like to come along to the cemetery to leave the flowers, Mark sort of stiffened up, saying he'd rather not. Those had been his exact words, in fact; \"I'd rather not\". Mark hadn't spoken the words in a harsh or cold way; nor did he sound indifferent. Reluctant, if anything, but that didn't fit perfectly either. What Jack ultimately decided on was \"distant\". It made sense, actually; and it explained, in a sense, how Mark had made such progress on dealing with the loss of his mother in so short a time. Mark, Jack concluded, was still feeling grief over losing his mother. Enough of it, in fact, that he was trying to distance himself from the whole thing. Going out to Maine had put enough literal distance between Mark and his mother's grave that he'd found some chance to focus his mind on other things. The two weeks in Maine, Jack realised, had given his son time to start healing his wounds, but those wounds were only just starting to heal. Perhaps Mark felt like he needed to stay away for now; maybe he was afraid of losing what ground he'd gained if he did or saw anything too directly. It made sense, if that was Mark's approach. Not only was it actually a somewhat healthy way of dealing with things, Jack figured, but it also explained why he'd talked so much less about Janice since getting back. It wasn't- couldn't be that Mark didn't care anymore. It had to be something else. Maybe all Jack's son needed was that distance. Distance… and time. Jack made up his mind over it that first week back; he forgave Mark readily, talking it over with his son a little, and nodded internally when Mark's responses more or less matched up with what Jack had figured on. Mark just needed distance, and time. That was all, and Jack understood. He headed out to the cemetery himself, and placed the flowers alone. He knew Janice understood. The two Evans cousins must have gotten along quite well; Henry, it seemed, had made quite a friend for Mark. Susan and Wallace had both confided to Jack that the two boys had gone through some rough patches that first week; the overall feeling between them was mixed those first days, as far as any of the adults could tell. But after that? Roses all the way. The boys had bloodied each other up fairly well after Connie's accident on the lake; hearing about that fight they'd had in the hospital that night was quite a shock to Jack. But in a way, each of their actions made sense. Mark had been furious, blaming Henry for Connie's near brush with death. Henry, for his part, had just lain there and taken it, letting Mark beat him up right there in the hallway of the hospital. Jack had shivered when Susan had told him the story, talking in the living room while the boys were getting Mark packed upstairs. \"Go on, Mark!\" Henry had yelled. \"I deserve it!\" And Mark, snarling furiously, had nearly kept on going… but his aggression, it seemed, had gone soon after. The boys had ridden home in Susan's van. They must have patched things up on their own time, though, because gradually, the boys had gotten along better after that. Maybe that's all it had taken; Henry had been too careless about Connie's safety, and Mark, already irritated by other disagreements with Henry, had done something about it. What made Jack feel rather odd was the tale of Mark in that encounter; he had leapt out of hiding and ambushed Henry in the hospital hallway, having clearly planned his actions out in advance. And that anger, the rage Mark had clearly displayed… Jack had never heard of Mark acting that way before. He'd never attacked a boy in his life. Or anyone, for that matter. Susan and Wallace were sure the boys had talked things out on their own that night, though- or perhaps the night after that. Besides some minimal effort to suggest Mark be given Richard's room, a suggestion ultimately turned down over the anguish it still caused Susan, Henry and Mark had made no attempt to request that they stop sharing Henry's room. This, in particular, led the adults of the house to believe the boys were working things out their own way. Many times they saw them talking on their own, going places together. By the end of the second week, of course, they were not only getting along steadily, but Henry had been giving Mark impromptu karate lessons. And that led right into Jack's next observation about the new Mark. And that seemed to be the most appropriate term; Mark, sometimes, seemed like a different boy now. He was still Jack's son, and there was no disputing that in the older man's mind. But Mark was different. That, too, was indisputable. Jack recalled, now, hearing from Wallace what an independent boy Henry was; he was always working on something on a work bench, out in the shed- Henry was good with his hands and liked being alone at times. Mark had shared some of Henry's somewhat-introverted nature even before Janice had passed away, so that in itself wasn't entirely unusual. What was, instead, was another side of Henry Jack now recalled hearing about- Henry had a certain preoccupation, to say the least, with violence. So many of the models, pictures and posters decorating his room had a military or war-related theme, and Henry loved the martial nature of soccer and was a devoted student at his karate school. More than once Wallace, who had enrolled Henry on his own initiative but been surprised at how fast Henry had gotten to like it, had suggested Mark, too, be enrolled in a karate school. Jack had given that some consideration, but he never asked Mark- his son just didn't seem to have much interest in such things. Jack had wondered about that; why Mark seemed rather shy when Jack had tried testing the waters by talking some about the common ground Henry and Mark had in playing soccer, and mentioning how Henry did karate lessons, too. That shyness, that hesitation; whatever it was, it certainly was gone now. Two weeks after returning from Maine, Mark had surprised Jack by approaching him one evening. Of all things, Mark had been the one to start out by bringing up Henry's karate lessons, and stated- and that was the way he'd done it, too, Jack realised; not so much asked as stated- that he be enrolled in karate lessons himself. Jack had promised to look into it, and meant it; but his business work, though going well, kept him very busy. Thus, Mark had surprised Jack yet again by coming back to Jack's home office a couple of days later, repeating his desire to attend karate classes like Henry- in fact, he'd almost demanded it this time. Mark's forwardness in wanting to attend self-defense classes the way his cousin did was startling to Jack; Henry must have not only gotten Mark interested in physical, even violent activities like karate, but also taught him some things about confidence and self-assurance, too. Mark was showing signs of self-confidence, of an ability to hold his ground, that he hadn't before. He still gave the impression of a boy who would rather not get in a fight- but once or twice Jack wondered if, the way he acted sometimes now, Mark wouldn't stand his ground if a fight was to happen. Regardless, even, of what his prospects for winning were. Again, though, Jack had no complaints. If Henry had imparted some of his cool, intelligent self-assurance to Mark, that was just fine. Mark was hardly a weak or incapable boy before, but he was at the very least more… independent, now. More interested in taking care of himself, of taking charge of his own affairs. Talking on the phone with Wallace or Susan now and then, Jack was unsurprised to learn that Henry indeed was much the same way; confident, yes, and unusually independent for his age. No complaints from me , was Jack's common refrain. What was there to complain about? Mark was growing up, and if Henry had helped him to really start doing it, taught his cousin some things that, after all, really were worth knowing… what was there to complain about? What, indeed? So, finding no reason to object- and agreeing with Wallace's assertion that the lessons would be a good thing for Mark to focus his mind on, keeping him in his current direction of starting to move away from his mother's death, and move on- Jack had enrolled his son Mark in karate lessons. There, through just the first two weeks, Mark had surprised people- not the least his father- yet again. He'd either been harboring some long-hidden ability in physical combat- Mark was a better-than-average soccer player, after all- or those improvised lessons with Henry had really given Mark a good start. Perhaps both. Whatever the reason, Mark was ranked as a green belt before anybody but his instructor knew it- and Mr. Jennings had told Jack one day how impressed he was with the boy. He didn't see younger students who learned this quickly, or were so eager to learn more, very often. Those two changes were plenty to get used to, by themselves. And Mark, something of a creature of habit much like his father, had never seemed like somebody who would make so many significant changes, so quickly. And Mark had a bit of a clever streak Jack also hadn't noticed before; when asked about these changes, about how long he'd been harboring his interest in karate for example, Mark just smiled a little and shrugged it off. It was almost like he knew why Jack was asking, but figured he'd rather dodge the question anyway. Jack let it go. Again, it was likely all just the effect of two things; Mark adjusting to life after his mother's death, and his new- and strong- friendship with his cousin Henry. And the two were nothing if not good friends; it wasn't long before Jack noticed either Mark or Henry was calling the other on an almost daily basis. When Susan called on Christmas Day, Mark talked with everyone at the Evans house in Maine- Susan, then Wallace, and even Connie- but he was on the line with Henry for what had to have been an hour. This phenomenon not only continued into the early days of 1994, but if anything intensified. Jack's phone company must have liked him a great deal, Jack figured; why wouldn't they, when Mark and Henry were conspiring to be some of their most loyal customers? This latest development Jack couldn't pass off as easily, not when it started affecting the numbers Jack so prided himself on keeping straight. Normally, he wouldn't have minded, especially since Mark- and Henry, it was safe to assume- was so clearly enjoying the conversations. But while Jack appreciated the beneficial effect it had for Mark- clearly, his son had indeed made a friend back in Maine- the phone bill's increase was a little difficult to just pass off. It wasn't a small number. On January 10th, Mark returned to school; having finished the 6th grade the previous year, Mark had entered his second year of junior high- 7th grade- this past fall. His first year in junior high would be finishing in just a few months, and Jack was glad to see Mark return to school readily and without much trouble. The phone calls kept up, though, which led to Mark and Jack's first serious fight on the 11th. Mark got a call after dinner that day, and was on the phone for nearly an hour. Jack, elbow-deep in work in his office in the house, didn't mind- much. Mark needed a friend right now, and if letting Henry be that friend meant paying the increased phone bill, then so be it. But once Mark finally hung up and went back to whatever he'd been doing, Jack got a call from the office. One of his employees at work was on the line, not in a panic yet but definitely worried. Jack, picking up on this right away, asked what was going on and began to walk the employee through it. An emergency had come up at the office; one of the contractors Jack's firm had planned on hiring to bring in the new sets of printers, computers and so on had messed up good, somehow only delivering half of the ordered equipment. The contractor was promising to have the other half of the shipment brought over to Jack's company within a week, but the employee stressed they couldn't wait a week. It was a bad choice or a worse one; pay the contractor the original price and wait, or find somebody else to do it in a day or two and pay them a lot more. There was no perfect choice that evening; in fact, there wasn't even a good choice, or a decent one. Jack made the choice he knew he had to, though; he told the employee to pay the contractor for what was delivered, but cancel the rest and order it through another company. They'd have to pay that extra for the upgraded delivery time, but Jack's company had to have those office electronics. The call ended up taking a tense twenty minutes; Jack nearly forgot to ask, but damn near hit the roof when he asked the employee- Sean Henderson, his second-in-charge at the office- how long he'd been trying to reach Jack. \"An hour, at least that long,\" Henderson said. \"The line was busy.\" Finally, Jack decided he'd drive out and meet Henderson at the office- at the very least, to personally thank him for trying so hard to get the problem solved today. Jack had to show appreciation for that. \"All right,\" Jack said, standing up as he looked around for his keys and coat. \"Just stay there, Henderson. I'll make it up to you; we'll get this straightened out.\" The delay in that news reaching Jack had nearly been disastrous; when these moments came up, every minute counted. Henderson had already stayed late at the office trying to reach his boss at home; another ten minutes, and he'd have had to give up, go home, and wait till morning. Delays like that were unacceptable- and all the more so because Mark having been on the phone that whole time had been the only reason. As he threw on his coat, getting ready to head out, Jack called Mark down to his office, and when Jack asked who he'd been on the phone with, the almost insolent expression on Mark's face told him the answer before Mark even spoke. Then he said, \"Henry called; I was talking to him,\" and Jack hit the roof. \"I just got a call from Henderson at the office, Mark!\" Jack exclaimed, too shocked to be truly angry at first. \"It was an emergency. He said he was trying to reach me for an hour ! You know I sometimes have to take business calls at home, don't you? What were you and Henry talking about that whole time?\" Mark, leaning in the doorway, just shrugged; a strange look, hinting at anger just waiting for something to spark it and set it off came into his eyes. \"Stuff, I don't know,\" Mark said, as if the answer was obvious. \"We were talking.\" Jack stared. \"Mark!\" he exclaimed, \"Didn't you hear the call coming in? Did you even check to see who it was?\" \"No,\" Mark said, \"I was talking to Henry,\" in a tone that implied Henry had a similar importance in Mark's mind to the Pope. The insolence in his voice- something Jack would have sworn before a court he'd never heard from Mark in his life- nearly made Jack explode. \"I can't have calls from my office not getting through!\" Jack yelled, tired and frustrated. \"Every time something comes up, every time there's an emergency- I need to know ! I can't have your calls to Henry getting in the way of that!\" \"I'm going upstairs,\" Mark said, pushing off the doorframe, his voice frosty. Jack sighed, exasperated. \"Yes, fine. I've got to go out to the office; Henderson needs my signature on a thing or two. I'll be back in a while.\" \"Okay,\" Mark said, already keeping his word and heading around the corner, down the hall and upstairs towards his room. Jack thought about calling after him, but didn't. He turned and headed out the door; this situation at the office needed to be resolved today. As Jack drove out to his office, though, he found himself very unsettled by the argument he'd just had with Mark. Neither of them had ever yelled at the other before; he didn't care for how it made him feel. Half an hour later- it was about 7:40 then- Jack returned to the house. He parked the Wrangler in the driveway, sighing as he turned off the engine. He had taken care of the situation his company had run into- even with the deal with the Japanese signed and sealed, it seemed like a new crisis came up every day or every week. But Jack knew that didn't excuse getting so fired up. It didn't excuse yelling at Mark- the first time in his life he'd ever done that. I've got to make things right, Jack thought as he got out of the Wrangler, shut the door and walked up the walkway and into the house. I need to say something to Mark. Jack made himself take action on that right away, just as soon as he got inside and closed the door; he wanted to let Mark know he felt badly about earlier, while it was still fresh on his mind. \"Mark?\" Jack called from the front door of the house. The house had two floors; he wasn't sure if Mark could hear him up there. Or if his son was even listening. Silence was the only response, but Jack knew his son could hear him. He hung up his coat and made his way upstairs, turning left and heading down the hall to his son's room. \"Mark?\" Jack called again cautiously; he hoped he hadn't upset Mark too much earlier. Jack knew he shouldn't have let his temper get the better of him; never, ever could running his company become more important to Jack than his son. That was a mistake too many men had already made before him- and one Jack vowed he would not make himself. \"Yeah, Dad?\" Mark answered from his room, and Jack felt a certain relief; Mark's voice sounded a little cautious as well. Like he, too, regretted his earlier words and actions, and just hoped they hadn't carried things too far. Jack reached the doorway to his son's room; opposite from the doorway was a window with a dresser sitting beneath it, and another window at the end of the room, off to the left. Mark's bed sat in the corner along the same wall as the wooden dresser, and a closet was directly opposite of that. Like most of the house, Mark's room was lined with gray-white, soft and thick carpeting. Mark was lying on his bed, holding up a model submarine and gazing at it; it was a model of the Royal Navy ballistic missile submarine HMS Vanguard . Jack, had he known more of Henry's fondness for such symbolic instruments of power, would have known Henry had an identical, hand-carved model in his room. Mark had received the duplicate for Christmas; Henry's persistence in trying to lavish his cousin with gifts for that holiday was a pleasant surprise for everyone involved; Henry had never shown more than minimal interest in such things before. Mark put down the submarine model, sitting up and moving to the end of his bed to replace it on the stand atop his dresser. Brushing at his wavy brown hair, Mark looked at his father expectantly. He looked like he wanted to say something, but Jack decided he'd better say something first. \"I'm sorry about earlier, Mark,\" Jack said without preamble as he stood in the doorway. \"Running a business is a tough job; I know that, but I shouldn't let it get to me. I didn't mean to get so upset earlier.\" Mark got up and wandered over towards his father, his expression rather difficult to read. He then surprised Jack by throwing his arms about Jack's waist, hugging him tightly. \"I'm sorry, too, Dad,\" Mark said in a somewhat muffled voice. Surprised and moved, Jack hugged his son back, then after a time gently separated them again. Mark looked up at his father, looking almost mournful. \"I didn't mean to cause a problem, Dad,\" he said. \"I just really like talking to Henry. Can I still call him sometimes?\" Jack looked down at his son, hugging him again and then giving the only answer. \"Of course,\" Jack said, feeling all the more ashamed of his earlier anger. \"Of course you can. You guys really did hit it off those two weeks, huh?\" \"Yeah,\" Mark said, smiling as he remembered. \"We sure did.\" He hugged Jack again, then looked up at him and smiled a little. \"Thanks, Dad.\" The two talked for a few minutes more, and Mark surprised his father yet again- he was getting very good at that these days- by asking more than once if everything was all right at work, if the crisis that had come up at the office was now abated. Jack said yes, everything was fine, and Mark readily agreed to Jack's request that he make sure to at least check who it was if calls came in during the future while Mark was on the phone. Jack went to sleep with remarkable ease that night in January; he felt, yet again, like he was not only getting his son back, but beginning to see a better, more resilient Mark than he'd ever known before. It was a truly wonderful thing to see. Mark, that night, felt weary. Once he finally said good night to his father- they'd had some popcorn and talked for a while in the kitchen- Mark wandered back to his room, feeling nothing if not worn out. He couldn't quite explain why; perhaps today had simply served to illustrate how important Henry's friendship had become to him. And how much he missed being with his cousin, his friend- or maybe, to use Henry's assertion upon meeting Mark, his brother. Mark stripped to his jeans and lay down on his bed; in further imitation of Henry, Mark also dropped to the floor and did 10 pushups before actually lying down for the night. In just 18 days Mark would be thirteen years old; in countless cultures the world over, that- not age 18- marked a boy's passage into the beginning of the years of manhood. Mark found himself excited these days when he thought of those times to come. High school- getting to drive, maybe smoke or drink… and girls! Mark liked that idea a lot. He wasn't at that point yet… but soon. For now, Mark went to sleep easily enough- but not before wishing he really was Henry's brother, and that he instead lived with him back in Maine.[Chapter 3] Chapter III- New Ways School resuming meant Mark seeing his old friends and teachers again; one of the better of the former was Alan Parks. He and Mark played together on the school soccer team, and had gotten along well in elementary school, too. Alan had also been sincerely sympathetic towards Mark when he'd heard his mother had first been sick, then passed away; Mark remembered that, and appreciated it still. The two had met again at school shortly after the start of the spring semester, and Mark had greeted his friend as just that. Before long, they were going to soccer practice and hanging out again, just like old times. One Friday afternoon, Mark went to the school office to call his dad at work, briefly asking if it would be all right if he rode the bus home to Alan Parks' house that afternoon. Jack, glad to see Mark spending time with his friends again, had no trouble saying yes. Mark took Bus #39 home that afternoon, instead of #826, the one he usually rode. For most of the remaining daylight hours, Mark and Alan braved the cold to play some soccer outside, keeping up a brisk enough pace that the chilly air- balmy, in fact, after Mark had spent those two weeks witnessing the vicious winter of Maine- that the slowly retreating winter didn't bother them. Towards dinnertime, though, Alan asked the logical question; why not just stay for dinner- and, if Mark wanted, go ahead and stay overnight? Mrs. Parks, the sole authority in the house with Mr. Parks- an attorney with Levritt & West- out of town on a case, told Mark he was welcome if he wanted to stay the night. After calling one more time to notify his father and make sure it was all right, Mark accepted Alan's offer and did so. Mark and Alan had known each other for years; in fact, more or less since kindergarten. They hadn't been friends that whole time, but since the second grade was pretty close. Like so many other people back in Arizona, Alan Parks was sure he knew Mark. Or he had been, before he'd gone out to Maine during Christmas Break. Mark said he'd stayed with his aunt, uncle and two cousins while his dad had gone on a business trip to Japan for two weeks. Alan remembered how Mark had been while his mother was dying; tense, withdrawn, and understandably worried out of his mind. Mark was different now. For one thing, he talked more in class at school, chatted readily with people in the halls, and was generally more keen to step up and argue if another kid disagreed with him. It startled Alan sometimes, witnessing examples of this newer, more assertive attitude Mark had somehow gained. Even more mystifying was its apparent source; most notably, there hardly seemed to really be one. Mark had either gone through some significant changes on his own initiative over Christmas Break, doing so in the process of dealing with his grief over losing his mother, or someone else had gained influence over Mark in a way no one ever had before. Who? Alan had been a friend and teammate of Mark's for years, and none of this made sense to him. Certainly Alan had never held any ability to affect such drastic change in Mark, but neither had he tried. He couldn't think of anyone else at school, and Mark's dad, while still in mourning to some extent, was nonetheless recognizably the same man. Well… there was that cousin of Mark's. Henry Evans; Alan Parks had never even heard of him before. Henry was one of Mark's two cousins over on the East Coast, living up near Portland in Maine. Mark had mentioned he had family there once or twice before, but Alan had never met any of them, and Mark didn't seem especially concerned with those faraway relatives one way or the other. But now? To hear Mark tell it, he had a long-lost brother living in Maine rather than a cousin. It confused Alan to no end. Who was Henry? Why did Mark seem to draw such powerful inspiration from him, like those karate classes he now was so enthusiastic about? It was a sharp contrast to his past attitude towards such things, which had been indifferent at best. But in spite of the differences between Mark now and when Alan had last seen him, Mark was still in many ways the same person. Losing a parent was a drastic change; Alan had no trouble understanding that. It was possible, even, that between dealing with that and meeting a cousin he really happened to like, Mark had simply made a friend in Henry and wanted to be like him. In a sense, it was only logical. Mark still regarded Alan as a friend; certainly, Mark didn't seem to think anything had changed between them, and in spite of his wariness at times, Alan felt like he almost had to reciprocate. The sleepover hadn't gone too bad; not at first, certainly. They'd passed the time doing many of the things that had once allowed them to freely spend an evening and a night away, with hardly a care in the world. Alan had a certain feeling things would be changing; these boyhood traditions of staying up late just to prove you could, playing board games and watching movies- it wouldn't go away once they became teenagers, but things would change. It'd be all about cars and girls and whatever before long; in a way, Alan preferred being 12, when you were counted as one of the older boys but didn't yet have to worry about trying to be one of the men. Mark didn't seem to feel quite the same way. It wasn't anything in particular, nothing that Alan could put his finger on. But as the two roamed from one past-time to another, Mark just seemed grow restless, to get bored a little more quickly than he would have in the past. \"What is it?\" Alan even asked at one point, while they were sitting on the couch and Mark was channel-flicking after they'd finished watching a couple episodes of the old Phil Silvers show \"Sergeant Bilko\". It was an old TV show from the fifties or sixties, a comedy-type show that both Mark and Alan liked. Mark had enjoyed it well enough, laughing now and then along with Alan while those handful of episodes were on. Now, though, he was flicking through the channels, visibly bored again. He just didn't seem content. It was like Mark was thinking, \"I could be doing X instead.\" What, then, was X? \"Oh, I dunno,\" Mark said with a shrug in response to Alan's question. \"Come on, man,\" Alan said, not trying to push too hard but hoping for a better answer. \"You can talk to me.\" \"Haven't I been?\" Mark asked, putting on a look of mock innocence. \"Sorta,\" Alan said; now it was his turn to shrug uncertainly. \"Come on,\" he said, trying again. \"There's gotta be something you wanna do.\" It was 9:30, but neither of the boys was quite ready to go to bed just yet. In the spirit of so many other 12-year-old boys, they still had a certain inclination to believe that simply staying up past 8 or 9 in the evening was a great act of daring and rebelliousness. Mark sat silent on the living room couch for a few moments. Thinking. Finally, he seemed to make his decision, and glanced over at Alan, his cool blue eyes locking with Alan's green ones. \"Your dad still smokes, doesn't he?\" Not quite following this, Alan nodded. \"Yeah, sometimes.\" He gave Mark a curious look. \"Why?\" \"Oh,\" Mark said, glancing across the living room towards where Alan's mother had gone upstairs an hour ago, \"I just kinda felt like a smoke. You know?\" The offhand way Mark said this was kind of surprising, to say the very least. Cigarettes? Where on Earth had this come from? When Mark noticed his friend sort of just looking back at him, he hopped up from the couch, wandering into the kitchen where the light over the sink was on. Mark's memory was impressive; without even asking for confirmation, he looked through a couple of kitchen drawers and found one of Alan's dad's spare packs of cigarettes. They were tucked away at the far end of the drawer, out of sight unless you knew they were there- but Alan's dad was actually pretty casual about it. He knew Alan wouldn't take any of the cigarettes; his son didn't seem to care much for tobacco anyway. The same- at least in the past- had been true of Mark. Tonight, though, Alan Parks watched in amazement as Mark Evans easily snatched the pack out of the kitchen drawer, tucking it in his pants pocket and- with another furtive glance back towards the stairs up from the living room- headed downstairs to the basement. \"Dude!\" Alan hissed, hurrying down the stairs after him. \"Mark! What're you doing?\" \"Come on,\" Mark said. At first, he couldn't even tell why Mark was going down here. The basic, utilitarian layout of the basement included concrete floors and bare stone-and-wood walls. There was a general storage room with the washer and dryer, the garage- and a bathroom with an indoor-to-outdoor fan. Oh . \"Mark,\" Alan said uneasily as they stood in the basement hallway, \"You can't be serious, man. Are you crazy ? My dad finds out you took those, he's gonna freak !\" Mark just gave him a look, one of a kind he'd never given his friend before. \"What're you so afraid of, Alan?\" \"What?\" Mark just shrugged a little bit, then gave his friend an affectionate light punch on the shoulder. He smiled as they stood by the stairs, the light from the kitchen reaching the two boys and providing a dim light in the otherwise dark basement. \"Come on, Alan,\" Mark said, hoping to sway his friend. He opened the pack, taking out a cigarette and placing it between his lips with ease. It was how casually Mark did it that surprised Alan the most; Mark looked like a boy who was fast learning a new lifestyle, not just a kid who was trying it out and perhaps gaining a habit. Mark looked at Alan again as he opened the bathroom door and reached to flip on the fan's switch. \"What's there to be afraid of, man?\" Mark asked, that smile still on his face. He motioned for Alan to follow him into the bathroom with his head, still holding out the second cigarette. Some quiet, small part of Alan wanted to. For just a moment, he felt a strange, somehow terrible temptation to just go in there and smoke the whole goddamn pack. But it was a feeling only, and didn't last. Alan backed away, shaking his head. \"No, man,\" he said. \"No thanks. I'll stay out here.\" \"Not gonna tell on me?\" Mark asked, a little wary. Alan had to shake his head, though; his parents would probably not notice a missing cigarette, and Mark was his friend. \"No,\" Alan said. \"I'll wait.\" \"You sure?\" Mark said, taking out the lighter he'd brought with him. \"Yeah,\" Alan said, still uneasy about yet another new, unexpected change in Mark. He'd hated cigarettes the last time they'd talked. Mark just shrugged, not bothered in the least. \"Suit yourself,\" he said, flipping open the golden Zippo and turning inside the bathroom, closing the door. A moment later the fan began to hum, steadily venting the air and shipping it outside. Inside the bathroom, Mark took his first drag in a month, closing his eyes and holding the warm, acrid smoke in his lungs before letting it out, breathing it towards the fan. Alan had been a good friend to Mark for years; why was he being such a killjoy now? Mark understood Alan's hesitation, that worried look that had come over his face when Mark had so brazenly proposed a secret breaking of the rules. It was the look of a boy well-conditioned to be obedient, a good little boy who followed the rules and did what he was told and let the adults run his life \"until you're ready\". That was who Mark knew he'd been before going up to Maine. He was different now, and thankful for it. Henry had set him free. Taking another drag and letting it out after a few moments, Mark remembered how Henry had once made him that same offer; and how he, Mark, had looked just like Alan at the time. He'd been afraid… just like Alan Parks clearly was now. Alan wasn't a coward, but just like Mark had once done, he spent too damn much time being scared. If there was one thing Mark had learned from his cousin, it was that it just wasn't worth it. Life was scary; guys like Alan needed to wise up and get used to it. Have a smoke once in a while and don't worry about it so much. After maybe five or six minutes, Mark had burned the cigarette almost down to the filter. Wishing he could just sit in here and burn up half the pack, Mark took one last drag and tossed the butt in the toilet, flushing it and waiting another minute or two before turning off the fan. He'd been careful, always sending the smoke right towards the fan and sitting near it. Leave the door open and let the central air of the house take its course, and there'd be no smell left at all by morning. True to his word, Alan was still out in the basement hallway when Mark returned, fidgeting nervously with his bowl-cut of flaming red hair. \"You missed the fun, man,\" Mark said, trying and not quite succeeding to suppress a smirk. Alan's unease over this was kind of funny when you looked at it his way. Alan just shrugged, looking rather uncomfortable. \"Can you put the pack back where you found it?\" Mark nodded, not wanting to make this too difficult for Alan- and, though he didn't particularly care if Alan got in trouble, Mark could see no way letting that happen would benefit him. He headed up to the kitchen and placed the pack just where he'd found it. \"Happy?\" Mark asked, a bit sarcastically, but Alan nodded. It was getting towards 10; having passed the evening by and now with bedtime the next priority, the two boys headed upstairs to Alan's room. Alan had shared a room with his older brother Calvin for a few years, but the Salamander Incident had largely changed that. Calvin was over in the Midwest now, attending the Kemper Military School. Not a whole lot seemed to have changed- in the past year, Calvin had proved he hadn't learned much by then committing the Noodle Incident, an act that Alan- and many of Calvin's classmates at school- had thought absolutely hilarious. The Parks elders, however, had not been so amused. Calvin's one year tour of duty at KMS had been upgraded to two. Even had Calvin been at home, he still wouldn't have shared a room with his younger brother; one of the Parks' spare rooms had been given to Michael once he started turning fourteen and fifteen, and the shared room with its bunk beds started getting a little small. The beds were fine for Mark and Alan, though; growing boys they certainly were, but though closing in on thirteen, the beds that had fit them as children were still good enough for them. Mark headed quietly down the hall to brush his teeth, using a new one Alan gave him for today, then Alan went. When he got back, Mark was settled into the lower bunk, the covers coming up to his bared middle. He had his hands folded behind his head, looking up at the underside of the upper bunk, looking calm and content- quite so, indeed, now he had that nicotine racing through his system. Mark was amazed he hadn't noticed that before; but then again, because of his boyish fears, there had been more than a couple of things Mark was unwilling to try. Alan stared for a moment, then flushed and made a point looking away. \"Dude,\" Alan said awkwardly, \" Dude - are you naked or something?\" Mark shrugged, his pale shoulders going up and down slightly. \"Yeah. So?\" The other boy rubbed the back of his neck uncertainly, then noticed Mark's clothes- every stitch- folded and neatly stacked at the end of the bed. \"Well-\" Alan stammered, trying to find the words, \"Well- it's weird!\" Mark laughed a little, the sound almost contemptuous. \"Does it really make you that uncomfortable?\" he glanced at Alan, noticing the expression on Alan's face seemed to say yes. \"Whatever, man,\" Mark said, sighing resignedly. \"I'll get dressed in the morning. Don't worry about it.\" Alan sighed too, giving up and shaking his head. Changing into pajamas for the night, he climbed up to the top bunk. The two boys talked amiably for perhaps half an hour; both had a certain liking for that habit boys have of only speaking of certain subjects late at night, when nobody else was around to hear. They speculated about what it would be like to be teenagers; Mark expressed disappointment that their favourite sport- soccer- was not as popular in America as it was in Europe. \"Over there,\" Mark said, \"we'd be rockstars.\" Alan laughed at that, feeling a bit more at ease; that was something he and Mark could still agree on, and it was nice to have a reminder that was still possible. Sometimes, lately, Alan wondered about him and Mark in the future. Sometimes, as you grew up, he heard that friends simply got to liking different things, and didn't see as much of each other anymore. Alan liked Mark even with their newfound differences; he hoped they could avoid such a fate. Eventually, the talk between them ceased as both boys grew tired; they bade each other goodnight and began to go to sleep. In the lower bunk, Mark thought again of Alan, of how his reaction to something new Mark did had twice mirrored his own, when he'd first seen that action displayed by Henry. Alan had been confused, repulsed- much as Mark had been. It annoyed Mark now; that sort of thing was just so childish. So Mark liked sleeping naked sometimes- they were both boys, and last time he'd checked, neither he nor Alan was homosexual. So who the hell cared? It felt good, and Mark found he liked going shirtless when the weather was good, sleeping naked when possible. Henry, with a sly smirk, had remarked that it helped to remind a boy he had something to show off. Something that- in just a few years- the girls were gonna be begging to see. That was another thing Mark liked about Henry; a visionary, he was often- perhaps always- looking to the future. Back among the classmates he'd known before he'd gone up to Maine, Mark sometimes felt like he was a steadily growing boy- in maturity and in form- and his so-called 'peers' were a lot of little children. Some were better than others, but overall… Mark wished he had Henry around. Henry was, just as the phrase went, too cool for school.[Chapter 4] Chapter IV- Force & Change Mark knew he was a different boy now; he walked, talked, and acted in ways he never had in the past. It wasn't anything instant or so obvious that literally everyone could see the new boy Mark had become… but in a way, everyone could. In PE class- a subject many boys, Mark among them, had once been so-so at best in- Mark was engaging himself with gusto, enjoying the chance to run, do pull-ups and pushups, and try out new sports every week. He wasn't the strongest or fastest of the boys in his class- not yet- but Mark's new enthusiasm for physical education surprised everyone. Mark held his head higher these days, and as much as losing his mother had bothered Mark, he knew it was something he now had behind him. There was a time for mourning your losses, but there was such a thing as too much. Mark had been headed for a lengthy session of mourning; perhaps he'd never have gotten over it, period. Henry, on the other hand, had showed Mark how vital it was to take blows when they came, but to always come right back and keep going, always keep going. You always had to be moving forward. The change in Mark was gradual, but steady, and Henry was cheerful and encouraging whenever Mark called. When the two had been standoffish and distant- at times even unfriendly- during that first week, Henry had been cold and arrogant. He was warm and generous to those he liked, but had a brutal sarcastic streak, and was very cold to those who angered him. But none of that applied to Mark; having accepted Henry's offer of friendship, Mark was now reaping the benefits. He could always call the house in Maine to speak with his cousin for advice, or just to talk about how things were going at school and at home. Henry was always making time to talk to him, and called Mark regularly himself. What surprised Mark the most was one day, shortly after his birthday- which Henry had of course called on and sent presents for- when Mark called. Henry had been out in the shed in the backyard, working on some project or another he had out there. Mark, when told this by Aunt Susan, had smiled at the memory- he remembered Henry's \"laboratory\", all right. Mr. Highway and the crossbow that fired railroad spikes had both been created there; Mark hadn't asked Henry what he'd been working on there lately, but it could be safely assumed it would be of similar- better- impressiveness. Mark's cousin had come inside around 6:30, an hour after dinner and perhaps a minute or so after Mark had called. He was traipsing through the kitchen in search of a warm snack- a good boy, Henry had made sure to leave his boots and coat in the entrance hallway- when Susan noticed him and told Henry Mark had called, and was still on the phone. Henry had quite literally dropped what he was doing- Mark had heard some bundle of things go crashing to the floor- and raced over to the phone. \"Hey! Hey, Mark!\" Henry said, sounding a little breathless and more than a little excited. \"What's up? How's my teenage- uh, cousin?\" he said, briefly casting a glance at his mother. He wasn't sure if he wanted his mother knowing about his bond with Mark, how the two really just called each other cousins so as to avoid questions from curious adults. Of course, the world- absolutely no one- could ever know how closely bonded the two really were… and, in his own thinking, Henry wasn't sure himself. He understood a lot about Great Aunt Helen's estate home across the suburbs, enough that he'd been willing to take a tremendous risk and lure Mark into the Hall and force him down, drag him back to the Glass Library… and let the house change him. Henry wasn't quite ready to admit it- not quite yet- but he was beyond thrilled at how well the whole thing had worked. On the other end of the line, Mark chuckled. \"What?\" Henry asked, frowning in confusion. \"What's so funny?\" \"You,\" Mark laughed, stifling rising laughter. Henry was silent for a few moments, trying to figure out if he was being made fun of. Finally, though, Mark heard him start to laugh, too. \"I know you didn't just call to make fun of me, loser,\" Henry said with mock disdain. \"True,\" Mark agreed. \"I saw roadkill the other day, and that squirrel still looked better than you.\" \"Eat me.\" Henry said. \"Only your intestines.\" \"With ketchup.\" The two boys laughed again, pleasantries now having been properly exchanged. They talked amiably for a few minutes, the range of subjects loosening up some as Susan headed elsewhere in the house and no one was around the kitchen to listen. Henry was almost green with envy that Mark had turned thirteen first; he was looking forward to being a teenager in a big way. High school was said to be the best years of somebody's life, and Henry had every ambition of forcing that statement to come true for him. Once he had wandered upstairs with the wireless set, Mark asked how Henry's \"projects\" had been going since he'd left. He could almost see Henry's face brighten at the question, and his voice lifted as well, showing his enthusiasm. \"Oh, man!\" he said. \"I'm doing all kinds of stuff! Making a squirrel trap, for one thing. That's gonna be fun!\" Knowing just what use Henry planned on putting that trap to, Mark snickered. \"Sounds fun, all right.\" \"Yeah,\" Henry said, his voice turning wistful. He lowered his voice a little, glancing around to make sure nobody was listening. \"It'd be a lot more fun if you were still here.\" Henry hit that nail on the head; Mark felt a deep pang of regret, a hope that he and Henry having the exact same wish at this moment could somehow help make it come true. \"Yeah,\" Mark said, wishing he could say something else. \"I know.\" But Henry, as always, had an answer; he made himself cheer up a little, knowing he needed to. For his cousin, even if not for himself. \"Well, it's okay,\" Henry said. \"We could never be done, Mark. We're brothers, and brothers look out for each other.\" Mark had to clear his throat a few times before speaking; he felt something gripping his chest, restricting his ability to speak. He missed Henry. Missed him so much it hurt. \"Listen, Mark,\" Henry said gently, \"I'm really glad you called.\" \"Yeah,\" Mark said finally, \"Me, too.\" Then, suddenly, Connie bounced into the kitchen, chirping something at Henry and then bouncing off into the house about how Henry was on the phone with a girl . \"Connie!\" Henry exploded, turning his head and only just remembering to avoid shouting into the phone. \"Don't you ever-!\" Then Henry remembered he was still on the line with Mark. \"Listen,\" Henry said, \"I gotta teach another lesson. Talk to you later, okay?\" \"Sure,\" Mark said, \"You just set her straight.\" He liked Connie well enough, but intruding- and perhaps listening in- on other people's conversations was rude. Connie needed to learn that now so she wouldn't make a bigger mistake later. Henry chuckled warmly- or coldly, depending on who you were. Connie doubtless would not have appreciated Henry's laughter at that moment in time. \"Oh, you know it,\" Henry chuckled softly. \"You know I will.\" \"Hang loose,\" Mark said, wondering where he'd even heard that, then hung up. He could almost see Henry tearing out of the kitchen, speeding through the vast white house and hunting down Connie for her transgression. Doubtless he would do something effective but harsh, and doubtless he'd get in some measure of trouble with his parents for it. But, also doubtless was the knowledge that Connie would indeed learn her lesson- and would never trifle with Henry like that again. Not when he was on the phone. In their conversations, Mark sensed something else about Henry. His cousin was always in a good mood when talking with him, but Henry's tone of voice gave the impression of somebody who was improving to a good mood- and perhaps hadn't been in one before. More than once did Henry mention how he had done this or that, gone here or there, and found it would've been a lot more fun if he hadn't gone there himself. He really missed Mark, and that night on February 5th, admitted it openly. Mark took that as a great compliment- one he could easily reciprocate. But Henry seemed to be particularly short-tempered with people lately, like gaining a friend and then just losing him two weeks later had made his overall tolerance lower. Mark understood that easily enough. One of the people Mark could barely stand even allowing in the same school as him- let alone the same room- was Sean Walters. Somehow naturally gifted as one of the strongest, fastest-growing boys in his class, Sean was the iconic, mean-spirited bully. He was tall, strong, and had a messy mop of black hair under which beady dark-brown eyes peered suspiciously, searching out weaker kids to establish his superiority over. Mark had given up his lunch money more than once in his early days at junior high; Sean had a way of finding him, it seemed. Once or twice he'd even endured a light beating- and that meant sitting there and being the kicky/punchy bag for a couple of minutes until Sean got bored. But Sean wasn't bothering Mark much these days. There'd been no direct moment of truth, no confrontation that showed Sean and all the school who Mark really was now. But Sean, seeing Mark the first day he'd come back, had started to move in as the smaller kid was at his locker, talking with that twerp Alan Parks- and Mark, somehow, had easily seen him coming. Mark hadn't done anything in particular, said nothing to Sean- but gave him such a hateful, venomous look that Sean suddenly altered course and just headed off to class. He'd thought about that moment for a week afterwards; never had he seen a look like that from a scrawny kid like Mark Evans. Never . Alan Parks, on the other hand- he was different. Sean beat him up a little after gym class one day- just a little playful slapping around, a few punches to the stomach and one to the nuts as a finishing touch- and the ginger-haired boy did just what the weaker kids always did. He tried to hurry for an exit without admitting fear and running, and didn't make it. He wisely gave up any effort of resistance, as that would've failed miserably and given Sean reason to let the beating really earn the name. And he tried to hold back, but just like all the others ended up crying anyway. Sean got bored and left him there before long, sniveling and curled up on the locker room floor. He'd made extra certain that Mark Evans had indeed left class early that day- the infirmary had called him up for some reason or another; a great stroke of luck as far as Sean was concerned. Last of all, Sean warned the Parks boy not to tell Mark Evans; dark look or no, Sean knew he could still take them both in a fight if he wanted, and it would be much worse for Alan Parks if he squealed, to Mark or the administration. If he did that, Sean advised, Alan Parks would never, ever again want to be alone. Not where Sean Walters could find him. Sean knew there were some kids who were just tough customers- or thought they were. Some eggs took more effort to crack. That was what Sean's pocket knife was for. He didn't carry it often, or his brass knuckles- but he could if he needed to. Mark didn't hear about the incident from Alan directly; another player on the soccer team observed Sean moving a little slower than he should have during practice the next day, and when a ball bounced off his chest- no big deal at all normally- Alan visibly winced in pain. Noting these things, Mark had approached Alan during a break and asked if everything was all right. The vehement, evasive way Alan said yes immediately made Mark suspicious; at the end of practice, he all but dragged Alan into the baseball field's dugout and threatened to beat Alan up himself if he didn't talk. Alan cringed visibly at Mark's sudden fierceness; for the first time in his life he was really afraid of his friend. \"Wh-what's wrong with you?\" Alan asked, scared and confused. Mark's fierce, tense expression softened somewhat, but not a great deal. \"Look,\" he said quietly, \"You need to tell me. I gotta know what's wrong, because if someone messed with you, I gotta go kick their ass.\" Alan just sat down on the dugout bench, clutching his bruised middle and wishing all the weirdness would just stop. That Mark and everybody else- or just Mark, really- would go back to the way they'd been. He didn't get his wish, because Mark just stood there, arms crossed over his sky-blue soccer jersey and the number 12 in white. \"Sean,\" Alan said finally, staring at the dirt on the ground. A dangerous fire lit in Mark's eyes, and instantly Alan felt afraid- this time not for himself, but for- of all people- the school bully. Well, one of the school bullies. Sean wasn't exactly alone in his role, not at a junior high school. \"Take off your shirt,\" Mark said, and it wasn't a request- it was a command. Too tired from the beating yesterday and practice today, Alan pulled his #9 jersey over his head and waited. Mark drew in a sharp breath as he looked over his friend's pale, lean chest and belly, now spotted unpleasantly with some well-placed bruises. \"Okay,\" Mark said finally. \"Put your shirt back on. Let's go.\" Alan asked- even begged- Mark to say no more about it, to not even tell anybody else on the team. Mark finally agreed, though he had to resist giving Alan a disgusted look as they walked back from the soccer field. What was Alan even doing; demonstrating teenage Stockholm Syndrome? Sean Walters was the biggest jerk in their class; what did Alan care what happened to him? But Alan was adamant, and Mark assured him everything would be fine. He meant that in a somewhat different way than Alan understood it, though. For a whole week after that Mark and Sean kept on ignoring each other, and Mark's standing among the hundreds of junior high students went up a small notch. He was no longer a victim, and that meant he could- perhaps- start to be taken seriously. The system was arbitrary and hypocritical about who it favoured, but some of it did have logic to it, however flawed it might have been. Simply enough, someone who looked like prey probably was. Girls- and guys- overall would not grant respect or popularity to someone like that. It was the boys who stood on their own two feet who got respect, and Mark was starting to earn some of that. In early February, though, right around the 7th, the weather warmed just enough that some of those students who could began walking home instead of taking the bus. Nobody at Duvall Junior High was able to drive yet, but with the teenage years beginning to make their mark, the school bus just wasn't all that cool anymore. So Mark was pleased to learn that Sean did indeed live within walking distance of school, and that his neighborhood was even fairly close to Mark's. The two happened to leave school at different enough times that neither had really noticed this before, but Mark noticed Sean heading out back and starting the walk home after school one day, just as he and Alan were getting ready to go. That Friday, when it was again sunny and Mark figured Sean would again be walking home, he made sure he and Alan were getting ready to go when Sean was. They headed out back, the one boy and the other two, one not quite aware of the others as he climbed the wood steps going up the tree-covered hill behind the school, planning to pass through these woods, head up a street and down another, and then be at home perhaps ten minutes later. Not far behind him though, and walking quicker than usual, was Mark- and not only was Mark madder than hell… he had a plan.[Chapter 5] Chapter V- The Fight \"Hey!\" Mark called, once he was twenty or thirty feet away from the bully's back. They were well into the woods now; plenty of distance between themselves and the school. Just right. Sean turned, blinking in surprise when he saw who it was. \"Hey!\" Mark said again, his eyes locked on Sean's. \"Yeah, idiot! I'm talking to you!\" Sean stared for a moment; the Parks boy beside Mark looked uneasy, almost a mix of fearful over what might happen if Mark lost, and eager to see the result if Mark won. But Mark? He was pissed. His blue eyes flashed angrily beneath his wavy brown hair, and he tossed his backpack down beside a tree like it wasn't there. Once they closed within ten feet, Mark grabbed his crotch suggestively. \"You even got one of these, big boy? Or are you the ugly girl of the family?\" \"Okay,\" Sean said quietly, tossing his own bag down too. \"Okay, wise guy. You want it, you're gonna get it.\" \"Only in your fucking dreams,\" Mark Evans snarled, raising his fists and advancing with his eyes narrowed to slits. Alan Parks just backed away. This was Mark's fight. Sean began to move forward, but for just a moment he felt a tremor of fear. A feeling that, perhaps, he'd messed with the wrong kid when he'd set his sights on Mark Evans. But the feeling passed, and certainly Sean wasn't about to back down now. He was half a foot taller than Mark, that much at least, and these two lanky soccer sissies didn't stand a chance against him. Not on any day of the week, angry or no. Sean moved in for the kill. It would be best to make this quick; he was looking forward to making Alan Parks' life a rolling sea of pain. Multiple kicks to the nuts would be the start this time. Just the beginning. Mark advanced too, and when Sean tried to punch him, the leaner boy blocked the blow with one arm, smirking grimly as he forced Sean's opening attack aside. The bigger of the two boys was surprised, but did not even entertain the notion of backing away. It'd be all over school tomorrow if he let that happen; these two little dorks would no doubt see to that themselves. So Sean attacked again, and the two boys traded blows for a minute or so; Mark fought back with surprising strength and speed, doing much better at holding his own than he would have just a month or two ago. Mark took a glancing blow to the left side of his face, barely noticing; he smacked aside another of Sean's punches and swiftly kicked him in the guts. Sean bent over, the air barfing out of him in a rush. Mark started laughing. Sean, on the other hand, began trying to back away, suddenly losing interest in the whole thing. He was doubled up, gagging and coughing. Mark, still laughing, moved around behind him and punched Sean twice in the ribs, then got right behind Sean and kicked him in the ass. The bigger boy fell over, still trying to catch his breath. He rolled to his side, got up and lashed out blindly, hoping more to force some distance between himself and Mark than to beat him. Sean's fist hit Mark on his left shoulder, and Sean was surprised again; the Evans boy might have been lean, but he sure was mean. And strong; those arms of Mark's had more power than Sean had ever expected. He didn't seem like such easy prey anymore. Mark took the blow to his shoulder easily, then sent out a lightning-fast blow to Sean's face, hoping to break something. He didn't, but the fist that struck Sean's nose with judiciously-calculated force did its job well; Sean backed away again, blood flowing freely from his nose. Mark attacked again, punching Sean in the mouth; the other boy tasted copper. Then Mark kicked him in the guts again, and Sean collapsed. \"Jesus,\" Alan Parks yelled, finally having seen enough. He ran towards Mark as his friend- still laughing- advanced on Sean Walters, his fists balled and stained with Sean's blood. \"Jesus,\" Alan cried again, grabbing hold of Mark and pulling him back. \"Stop it!\" In an instantaneous, reflexive act, Mark drove his right elbow backwards and slammed it into Alan Parks' stomach. Stars and black dots filled Alan's vision, and he stumbled backwards, clutched his middle, coughed hard and puked. He dropped to his knees, vomiting and gasping for air alternately. Sean Walters was down for the count; he was lying on the ground in the woods now, moaning in what had to be some of the most real pain he'd felt in a while. For just a moment Mark stood over the bully, his former tormentor, sweaty and breathing hard; in that instant Mark knew that for the first time in his life, he was truly tasting victory. He gloried in the moment and felt the power of his new way of life; clearly saw the gift Henry had so generously given him. The thought occurred to Mark again; Henry set me free . Then Mark became aware of another boy near him; he heard the coughing and spitting as Alan Parks finished rejecting the last of his lunch, grimacing horribly at the taste and still bent over on his knees. Mark stared, surprised; had he done that? Mark hurried over to Alan, putting an arm around the red-haired boy's shoulders and helping him stand. \"Oh, God, man,\" Mark said, stunned at how hard he'd hit Alan without even realizing it. He'd only been dimly aware of the person grabbing at him from behind; having forgotten about Alan Parks quite completely, Mark had assumed it was one of Sean's friends, ambushing him from behind. He'd just struck back, taking advantage of the fact that his opponent was clearly more hesitant than him. Alan stood slowly, then shoved Mark away. \"Get off of me! Let me go !\" he shouted, then staggered over to a nearby pine tree, setting a hand against it and gasping still. \"What?\" Mark said, surprised. \"I'm sorry, all right? I didn't mean to do that! I'm sorry!\" \"Just leave me alone!\" Alan snapped, then hunched over for a second. \"Oh, God ,\" he moaned, \"I think I'm gonna be sick …\" You already were , you weak little runt , Mark almost said, but bit the comment back at the last moment. \"Look,\" Mark said, \"You shouldn't have grabbed me like that! I thought one of Sean's friends was here!\" \"And wouldn't that have been too bad!\" Alan shot back sarcastically. \"You were getting ready to kill him!\" \"And so what if I had ?\" Mark snapped, surprised that Alan even cared. \"He's pushed us both around for years , man! He beat you up just the other day! You should be happy!\" \"I'm not!\" Alan shouted, scared and angry now. \"I never wanted you to fight him for me, okay? I don't want anybody hurt!\" \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" Mark said, sarcastic now when he said that word. \"I didn't know you cared about fuckers like him!\" Alan Parks stared at Mark for a moment, shocked beyond words; this was a day he'd never imagined he'd see. The Mark Evans he'd known for years was a nice kid, plain and simple. Just a nice kid. He always played fair, never started fights, and had a great regard for what was right and what was wrong. The Mark Evans that Alan was looking at now looked like a boy who'd just been trying to kill somebody. He had Sean's blood on his hands from some of the most vicious blows he'd inflicted, having turned his karate green belt knowledge into an offensive weapon. And if Alan could put a guess out there, Mark looked like he was happy about it. \"What's wrong with you, man?\" Alan yelled, angry now as well as scared. It was like he didn't even know who Mark was anymore. He had the same name, same face; but at the drop of a hat, he now acted in ways he'd never, ever done in the past. It was like at least half of him was gone, replaced by another person. A much meaner one. \"Since you got back,\" Alan went on, \"you've been acting weird! Real freakin' weird !\" Seeing the insolent, irritated look growing in Mark's eyes, Alan spat it out again. \"What's wrong with you?\" \"There is nothing wrong with me, understand ?\" Mark yelled, his hands held rigidly at his sides, balled into fists. \"Have you got four pounds of provolone where most kids got brains ? That jerk has picked on both of us for years ! He's the problem! Ask what's wrong with him !\" \"It doesn't make this right!\" Alan yelled back. \"He picked on us both for years !\" Mark repeated. \"The difference is, I'm acting like a man! I'm doing something about it!\" He crossed his arms, staring at Alan with contempt he didn't even bother to hide. \"You wanna spend the rest of your life being scared, Alan? Like a little mouse?\" \" Fuck you, man!\" Alan barked, snatching up his backpack and storming off towards the school; there were other ways to walk home. Ones that didn't require going with Mark. Alan stalked off, shaking his head. \"Screw this,\" he snapped. \"I'm gone.\" \"You'll thank me tomorrow!\" Mark shot back, then sighed and let Alan go. He knew he was right. He'd done what he had to do; and Alan would be grateful someday. One of these days he'd wish he could be strong and brave- just like Henry had taught Mark to be. Mark suddenly remembered Sean Walters, instinctively raising his fists and looking around; but Mark's former tormentor was nowhere to be seen. In the shouting match between Mark and Alan, he'd evidently grabbed his own backpack and made a swift and quiet escape. Mark swore violently, using some choice words Henry had taught him before they'd had to part. After a few moments, Mark grabbed his own bag and headed quickly onward, taking his usual way home through the woods and through a few neighborhoods that bordered directly on the rearmost edges of school grounds. All that yelling might have been heard by somebody, and sticking around to be seen would not be likely to pay off. The walk home normally took about ten minutes; Mark, walking at a fairly slow, casual pace, made it more like twenty. He passed through a neighborhood park on his way, following an asphalt path paved around the lake years ago. Memories of the recent fight came back to him, and Mark smiled sweetly as he remembered. Beating the hell out of someone he hated, getting revenge for his friend and for himself- it had made him feel powerful. It had made him feel strong . Clutching one strap of his backpack with a hand as he walked, Mark suddenly laughed quietly, remembering the strangely funny sounds he'd heard in the background while beating up Sean, after Alan had tried to grab Mark and Mark had elbowed him in the stomach. It had sounded- well, like Alan's stomach was squeezing his lunch back up. Apple, sandwich and all! Mark chuckled. For some reason, he didn't feel bad about hurting Alan like that. Alan had tried to interfere with Mark's revenge on a bully; thus, Alan had paid the price. And the sound of that vital organ in the other boy's belly, that sound as it had forced Alan's lunch back up and deposited it on the ground with a series of wet, pulpy smacks? Mark laughed again as he remembered that. The noise had been just too darned funny to forget. Mark savored, most of all, the feeling he'd had when he'd dropped Sean to the ground, stood over the now-helpless bully with victory in his hands. Had Alan not distracted him, had no one else been around… Mark might have killed Sean Walters, strangled him. Just too see how it felt. Even coming close… having the chance . That alone had felt great . Then suddenly, Mark remembered something else. Something very important. It had begun with Mark reflectively thinking how great it had been to continue the karate lessons Henry had begun to teach him, reminding himself to thank Henry for it- those lessons had sure paid off today. Then it hit Mark; he remembered. Henry! Mark had kicked some ass today; he'd put the pain on not one, but two boys who'd tried to get in his way and it felt great ! Grinning at the thought, Mark broke into a run and jogged steadily the rest of the way home. As he ran, he was sure of at least one thing. Henry's gonna love to hear about this.[Chapter 6] Chapter VI- Olden Days It was the same cat. Looking down the sights of the homemade crossbow, through the hood ornament of a 1985 Buick Riviera, Henry was sure. It had the same black-and-white pattern of fur, the same stupid tinkling bell attached to its collar, and the same habit of hanging about that stone wall on the far edge of the Evans property, down by Chamberlain Road. The downhill slope was scattered trees and some large rocks, providing Henry with plenty of cover from which to shoot. His blue eyes flicked up now and then, scanning what he could see of the road a few yards off, making sure he could duck out of sight fast if it looked like a car might see him. Unlikely, given how scant the chances were of a driver coming around the curve and looking uphill to where Henry was, but you still had to consider that. It was stupid crap like that- forgetting the little things- that could get you caught putting a rusty screw or bolt in the neighbor's cat. It was probably one of Mrs. Hess's cats- she had to have about twelve. Henry smirked. One won't be missed . He considered. Much . The cat was no more than twenty meters away; it was a point-blank shot. And Henry had been working hard to perfect the crossbow's firing mechanism and sights since Mark had visited. It had taken a few months to make the crossbow in the first place- much of that was due to the obvious need to carry out the work in secrecy. Had Henry been able to just ask his dad for manuals on home-made weapons and such, get a ride to the hardware store for the tools, things would have been a lot easier. But that wasn't possible, and wishing was useless. If you wanted something, you had to get out there and take it. Henry understood that very well. It was you or him, take or be taken. And Henry loved to take. The crossbow's sight had been off before. Nothing complex, really; just that the Buick hood ornament had not been lined up right. Henry had spent a few hours in the shed in January, adjusting the sights and testing each adjustment on aluminum cans behind the shed. The latest tests had gone well, and the indications they gave were positive. Henry smiled coldly now, the grim smirk of a magician about to release a flock of doves from his hat. For that was the kind of magician Henry was- he dealt in no single dove or rabbit, but would produce just as many as he liked, whenever he liked. And right now, Henry could hear himself humming some tune, smiling as he dropped a railroad spike down the crossbow's barrel. Kitty-cat wasn't gonna feel a thing. The cat paused on the wall, licking one of its paws; it was blissfully unaware of the danger. Henry cranked the spring back with the handle he'd fixed to the right side of the crossbow. Smile for the camera, dumbass , Henry thought with a cold smile, and squeezed the trigger. Ka-chunk ! The crossbow fired, releasing the heavy railroad spike and sending it flying through the air. There was a brief whizzing sound as it flew, then suddenly the cat on the stone wall was swept clean off it. The bolt slammed into the tree just two feet from the wall, taking the cat with it. It meowed in what must have been terrible pain for just a few moments, then was still, hanging limp where the spike had pinned it to the tree. Small trails of blood began to stain the white portions of its fur, as well as the bark of the tree. Henry grinned for just a moment, feeling that sense of accomplishment and triumph he'd known and loved for years. It was a special feeling, one Henry had first felt when he'd killed Richard years ago. It had been easy, really. He'd been upstairs, building the Porcelain Tower with a mountain of Lego's, trying hard not to listen to the occasional squeaking of the rubber duck as Richard played with it in the bathtub down the hall. His mother was there, cooing to Richard and just showering him with attention… Henry had to remind himself not to listen too hard that day, but his mind kept going back. His mother's attention, the duck. It was mine before it was his . Then, like a gift from heaven, the phone had rung downstairs. Susan had gotten up to answer it without much thought. After all, what was there to worry about? Henry was down the hall in his room, and there was just six inches of water in the bathtub. Richard was a toddler by then; he'd be fine. It was mine before it was his. That bitter, coldly furious thought had spurred Henry into action that day, more than two years ago now. He'd liked that rubber duck, and he'd very much liked being lavished with his parents' affection. Then Richard had shown up and started taking it away. Henry remembered what he did that day fondly- it was the first time he'd really enjoyed much of anything, besides people giving Henry attention and being nice to him. But Henry also remembered that day vaguely, like it had all happened in a dream. He remembered getting up, walking down the hall and pausing just short of the half-open bathroom door. Listening. Henry had listened carefully, checking for two things- his mother, talking downstairs with some friend of hers, and Richard, squeaking the duck now and then as he sat calmly in the water, splashing occasionally and waiting for his mother's return. Go. Henry had walked swiftly into the bathroom, slipping in without even touching the door. Richard, perhaps two years old, noticed Henry only vaguely. It was the other boy of the house; the bigger one, the one that didn't seem to like him very much. Richard squeaked the duck and gnashed his teeth absentmindedly for a moment. If the big boy was going to come in here to bother him, Richard resolved to bite him. That would show him. It had worked before. Richard was so busy thinking of his plan of action, and thinking himself quite clever for coming up with it, that he didn't see Henry standing there with a look of cold hate on his face, his hands clenching and unclenching in the shape of fists. Kill. Ten-year-old Henry had sprung forward on that thought, going to his knees as he neared the bathtub. Without ceremony, he set his hands on Richard's damp, chubby little shoulders and forced him forward. Richard squawked in surprise and then began to flail his little arms in fear; even he had been able to tell something was very wrong when those hands had shoved him under the water. To his credit, Richard had put up quite a fight; Henry's heart raced with fear, and he had been so worried his mother would hear something and come upstairs. If she had, that would have been the end, there and then. Henry would be living out his days in a padded room of maddening white, drawing KILL RICHARD on the wall with a crayon held by his toes, because his hands would have been bound in one of those lovely jackets \"those places\" had. But Henry's mother hadn't come up. Susan had stayed on the phone for the minute or so more Henry needed to keep Richard down, grab the younger boy's arms and stop the splashing… and then leave, taking the duck with him. By that time Richard was still. The six inches of water had been enough. It had taken a minute, seemed like an hour, and made Henry feel a sense of exultation and power he'd never known before in his life. He had taken back what was his, gotten rid of something that was useless to him… and he had killed. Ever since that day, it had been one of the only things that Henry truly felt he understood and enjoyed. Most people loved learning to paint, playing the violin or something. Henry could do all those things, and do them well. But he never enjoyed anything, before or since, as much as killing something. Taking a life. It made Henry feel like his own life became more powerful, more meaningful and significant, each time. Briefly, Henry exulted in the cold February air, grinning even as the cold stung his face and bit his bare hands. There was some pain from that, yes, but Henry liked it. Pain kind of felt good, somehow. Henry didn't question such things too much; he was a boy who trusted his instincts, his animal instincts, and knew that to contradict them was folly. Henry's sense of triumph, his sense of elation at having both perfected the crossbow and having achieved a kill with it, suddenly fell short, though. Normally, such a victory would leave Henry smiling for the rest of the day. It put him in a good mood every time, and made him feel like he'd really accomplished something. Today, though, things were different. Henry's smile slipped suddenly, fading as he realised. This would have been a lot more fun if Mark was here. It was surprising to think of, but it was also true. Somehow, Henry was just sure of it. Being alone had been fine before; after all, Henry had been alone all his life. For all his charm, all his skill at saying the right things and approaching adults just the right way, Henry had pretty much fallen flat with the other kids. He had few friends, and none he valued. Most kids didn't like Henry. They thought he was strange . Something about Henry just seemed to repulse them, no matter what he did. Admittedly, Henry hadn't always tried all that hard. He could have spent more time with the others on the playground, could have tried harder to be like the rest of them, play all their childish little games. Henry did, sometimes. But most of the time he didn't. The truth was he just didn't give a shit. But Mark? From the minute he'd shown up in Maine, he'd changed things. Right away Henry had liked him; even before Mark had shown up Henry had sensed things were about to change for the better. He'd heard from his parents that his cousin would be coming shortly after the funeral was over. Henry was fascinated by death but repulsed by funerals- he'd stayed back in Rockbridge with Connie, under the care of a family friend to avoid having to go. But when his parents returned and told Henry and Connie that their cousin Mark would be coming to stay in just a few days, Henry had practically sprinted upstairs to his room. Over the next day, he found the needed materials around the house and set to work. By the time Mark arrived, Henry had what he wanted- two plaster masks, each with a small elastic strap around the back. \"Here,\" Henry had said upon meeting his cousin for the first time. \"I made two of 'em. So we could be brothers.\" For quite some time- almost all of that first week, in fact- Mark had probably doubted Henry's words, questioned the sincerity in them. But whether or not he'd understood it then, Mark probably could see it now: Henry had meant what he'd said. He'd really sensed they could be best friends, blood brothers. And he'd wanted to be Mark's friend from the start. It had taken time, yes, and Mark had very nearly failed the series of tests Henry put him to. The whole thing was a little tiresome; Henry almost wished he could have just dropped the charade and asked Mark if he wanted to go kill something for fun. But the old Mark, while he'd had the right stuff- and a much hotter temper than Henry, the blonde sensed- had been too… nice. Too moral . And that was where the house had stepped in. Fleetwood Hall hadn't done all that much. It hadn't introduced anything that wasn't already there. Much as Henry had figured, Mark- like so many people- had it in him to be as cold a killer as Henry. All the house did- Henry was somewhat guessing here- was just rub out the stuff that made him such a pious sissy. Basically, that was it. Henry thought back to the last time he'd taken a shot at the cat that now lay dead by that tree. Mark hadn't even been aware Henry's miss really was a mistake. Then there was the time Henry had killed that jerk of a dog that lived in the area. Henry had never once feared that big, fierce dog. He'd never been scared by it like Mark was, and in fact the one time Henry looked that dog straight in the eyes, the dog had stopped barking, put its tail between its legs and walked away. Henry had forced the dog to blink- and then he'd killed it. Oh, how Mark had carried on then! Will we get caught, won't we tell somebody ? It had been all Henry could do to stop from just kneeing Mark in the balls and leaving him out there in the cold, with that fuckin' dog they'd killed. But Henry had resolved to be kind to Mark- to pity him, and try his hardest to build Mark up from the wuss he was then. So he had. Now? Henry shook his head bitterly. Mark had opened up a door in Henry's life that had seemed destined to forever remain closed. He'd given Henry a clear vision of hope- hope that he might one day soon have more than just a friend, but a brother. And Henry, once given that vision, could never let it go again. He'd cursed the second week for going too fast, exactly the same way he'd cursed the first week for going too slow. Mark had come into Henry's life and shown Henry what he'd been missing- how much more he could do, if he had one more buddy to do everything with. Just imagine! That time at junior high, when Henry had caught that sissy Bradshaw in the locker room after practice and pulled his pants down, grinning as he pulled a pocket knife and threatened to cut the trembling, silently crying boy's privates off… Mark could have been there, laughing in appreciation of the show his brother was putting on. And he'd have enjoyed reaping the benefits of that event's aftermath- George Bradshaw had paid Henry his lunch money on demand, any and every day of the week, for the rest of last year. Unfortunately, he'd also suffered a bit of a breakdown- just a bit, and Henry had nothing to do with that- had to drop out of soccer and ultimately left for another school. But the point was that Mark would have been there, enjoying Henry's handiwork instead of being repulsed by it like everyone else. Once in a while it bugged Henry, though he never let it show. Why did the other kids not like him? He was just doing what he knew he found fun, what he knew felt good and he liked doing. It was what any other kid was expected to do. And now? Henry had a feeling that had Mark been here today, there would have been no more \"Why'd you do that?\" or \"You're sick\" or any of the rest of that nonsense. No, the Mark that Henry knew now would have cheered. He'd have high-fived his blonde cousin over the kill- maybe even insisted on taking the shot himself, just to find out how it felt. It was ironic. Henry had found somebody who made his life more interesting and fun than ever- and when that person left after just two short weeks, it had made everything Henry had been doing before seem so much the duller. It was frustrating, the annoyance only made worse by knowing what the cause of it was. Nothing seemed all that fun anymore, not even this; all Henry could seem to think about was how much more fun things would have been, had Mark only been here. Suddenly Henry sprang up from his position on the hill. This latest, sobering thought, dampening his normal sense of victory and accomplishment, almost made Henry forget the cat was still pinned to the tree, and while it was on the side facing away from the road, this would be something Henry would not want to just leave lying around. People tended to think it odd if they found dead cats stuck to trees, especially with railroad spikes in them. And if somebody noticed the dead cat was pinned to a tree that just happened to be on the Evans property… why, that would be odder still. And if in asking those questions adults always did at such moments, someone thought to question Henry and perhaps search the shed… The white room. That's where that chain of events would end. It wasn't something Henry wanted to see happen. The very thought made a tremor of fear run through Henry; he rarely even let his mind wander towards the chance of him getting caught, ending up as he surely would in \"one of those places\". It was something Henry was afraid of- one of the only things that truly made Henry feel fear. He'd much rather die than go there- he'd rather be dead! But for now everything was still okay. No one had seen him. All Henry needed to do was get that dead creature off the tree. Get rid of the evidence. But thinking about the white room was more than enough to give Henry a sense of urgency. He hurried downhill, hopping over the stone wall and gripping the cat, centering his grip around where the railroad spike was. It was a big piece of metal, and had sunk into both the cat and the tree nicely. Henry was neither fearful of this thing he had killed, nor was he squeamish; in fact, Henry wanted to squeal with delight as he worked the railroad spike free of the big oak, and the railroad spike free of the cat. Oog , Henry wanted to yell for no particular reason. Oog! Oog, blood ! A car was coming! Henry could hear it. He grabbed the cat and the spike, the cold doubly stinging his hands now that blood coated parts of them. He darted uphill, making it behind a nice round boulder and back to the crossbow as the car rounded the corner, passing by on the road. Henry sighed a little, knowing he'd escaped. But there was work that still had to be done. Henry traipsed back uphill, making his way through the woods with the crossbow in one hand, the cat and the railroad spike in the other. Finding a burlap sack in the shed and putting the 'evidence' plus some well-placed rocks inside, Henry wandered up to the cliff edge, perhaps a five or ten minute walk from the house. Walking out on the jutting, triangular ledge that his mother sometimes stood on while thinking about things- like Richard- Henry paused for a moment, looking down. Then he threw the sack over the edge without ceremony, watching as it vanished beneath the waves below, the many jagged rocks and white breakers soon hiding it from sight. For perhaps a moment, Henry stood there on the cliff, not entirely sure of what to do. Then he walked right to the edge, the very narrowest point where both his feet could still stand. Henry spread his arms wide, tilted his head back and felt the sun warming his cold face. The wind whipped around him, freezing his hands and threatening to throw him off the cliff with one big gust. One wrong move, one good push from the wind, and over Henry would go- down there, to the waves whose deathly, remorseless cold matched what Henry guessed someone who knew the truth would say lived there, deep in his heart. But Henry doubted that sometimes. Especially these days. He was bored out of his mind much of the time, and angry at the wily, cheating cleverness of fate for bringing him a brother- a real brother- and taking him away again. But sometimes, Henry actually felt good. Like if he did go over the cliff edge now, he could go without a care. Because he'd had that two weeks; fourteen days where he hadn't been quite so fucking lonely. Henry hadn't had any idea just how lonely he really was- and that it could even bother him- until Mark showed up. Mark had given him something Henry didn't even know he was missing. Henry knew moments like this didn't change much. He knew that if one of those dorks at school showed up now, he'd throttle the kid without a second thought. If Connie showed up, he'd chase her back to the house vowing payback if he caught her. But nobody showed up- so Henry kept his head tilted back, his arms spread wide, and after a few moments closed his eyes. Thoughts- memories- ran through Henry's head, and he could almost hear Mark beside him, standing there beside Henry, right at the edge of the cliff. He could almost hear the voices of the two cousins. Not brothers yet, but soon. And to Henry, at that moment, they were already there. \" Close your eyes,\" Henry said. \" Why?\" Mark asked. \" Because it's a great feeling.\"[Chapter 7] Chapter VII- Something About Henry It was almost dinnertime when Henry finally got back. He had no idea how long he'd stood out there on the edge of the cliff. Maybe an hour, maybe ten minutes. For a time, Henry thought of how boring things were now, how short his temper seemed to be. It was getting difficult to explain some of the 'incidents' he was involved in at school, or the fight or two he was in almost every month now. Henry's temper- and his record- were starting to slip. Lying wasn't going to be enough soon if he wasn't careful. But. He. Was. BORED. For a time Henry even leaned forward slightly, thinking of something he'd said to Mark some time ago. Or something like it. If I let myself go… do I think I could fly ? Maybe, maybe not , Henry's mind answered him, But it would be a great feeling . Henry had suddenly leaned forward, started to feel the weight of gravity pulling him towards those deadly, jagged rocks waiting hundreds of feet below… Then he was falling backwards, his feet backing up and stumbling backwards. His mind might have been going for the cliff edge, but his feet snapped to and said \"Not at all, sir!\" Henry crashed to the ground, landing hard. His head struck the hard, barren ground and Henry saw stars. He jumped up, ran a few feet from the cliff, stumbling every few feet until he tripped and fell again. Henry had drawn himself up, hugging his knees and trembling. Now and then, he'd cast a glance at the cliff edge and shivered. I almost did it. God help me, I almost did it . Then Henry got up and began trudging back to the house. A bitter, cold thought occurred to him. Yet another indication of how restless he felt these days- how nothing seemed to matter, and he gave even less of a damn about his life than usual. Who cares ? Only Mark, and Mark wasn't here. He'd gone back to his old life, his old dad- and that meant being cousins again. Seeing each other once or twice a year, if they were lucky- and if not, perhaps not at all. When Henry got back to the house, he made sure to make his way straight for a bathroom. After taking a few minutes to carefully wash off the dried blood on his hands, Henry gingerly touched the back of his head and found his blonde hair was matted and stuck in a spot there; it was sore to the touch. Henry was trying to figure out just what this meant when his mother came by with a basketful of laundry to carry downstairs. She gasped a little, her eyes widening in shock and concern. \"Henry!\" she exclaimed, \"What happened ?\" It didn't take long for Henry to put two and two together. He'd taken a good blow to the back of his head, all right. Shrugging in apology, Henry said, \"I was outside for a while. I slipped on some ice- fell down, hit my head.\" Henry spent ten minutes in the kitchen for that one, holding a bag of that jelly-ice stuff wrapped in a damp towel to the back of his head, listening as his mother lectured him on how important safety was in the winter. And what had he been thinking, going outside with no gloves or hat? Was he trying to get sick out there? The pain feels good, Mom , Henry wanted to say, and even started to say it. But he knew he'd better not, even though it was what he meant to say. Henry was indifferent to things that harmed him almost all the time. He could exercise any kid's normal sense of self-preservation, and truth be told minded his steps well almost all the time. But sometimes, if danger, pain or even death stared him straight in the face, Henry just wanted to shrug and say, So what ? But he knew this was not the time. Listening to Mom lecture him on how he could've really hurt himself today, and how he'd better be more careful in the future, Henry bit back that reply he wanted to give. He'd learned very early not to speak such things aloud. It was what Henry understood to be normal, sure. But everybody else? Saying things like that would make them think Henry was weird; that he was sick, unnatural ! He got enough of that from some of those dorks at school. Creepy Henry , they called him, and sometimes they laughed. Then the whispers had gotten around about Henry threatening to cut off George Bradshaw's special parts. After that nobody was laughing. If Henry wanted to make the most of high school, he knew that \"Creepy Henry\" would have to go away. He couldn't just go on threatening kids for fun and letting the fear the rumors inspired- rumors, because he never got caught- keep everyone in line. He'd have to start playing their game, pleasing the kids as well as the adults. How else was he supposed to be the cool kid, the one all the guys wanted to hang with and all the girls wanted to be with? How, indeed? But Henry couldn't make sense of anything right now. Nothing seemed to fall in place like it used to. He knew all the old games, and could play them better than anybody. He was getting better at his old tricks and finding new ones. But he couldn't take his mind off how much better things would be, if only Mark were here. So finally, when Susan let Henry go after receiving his shy, bashful apology with dignity and grace, Henry wandered into the living room, sprawling out in the new, dark brown overstuffed leather couch Wallace had bought. God, he wanted a cigarette. But Howie Snyder, the bagboy at the Federal Market who sold him cigarettes while he was on break, was out of town right now. Henry couldn't remember why, mostly because he didn't care. He wanted to swear, too, but Susan would probably hear him. Henry had been fighting the urge to come home and test out new swear words on Connie every day since last year, when he'd gone into the sixth grade. Now, in the seventh, Henry knew plenty of dirty words. He'd cleaned up his act a little, enough that he had *some* friends at school now. He was a tiny bit cool these days- but only a tiny bit. Henry flicked on a lamp on an end table beside the couch, returning to stretching himself across the couch- not even caring that one of his feet was up on the couch itself, and in the Evans household that was not allowed. Who in hell cares? Henry thought smugly. Not me, no sir. I'll worry about it when Dad gets home. After he buys the rest of Chrysler . As Henry turned on the colour TV and began flicking through the channels, he paused at one. A car commercial was on- it was for the '94 Eagle Premier, that \"unsellable\" import from somewhere in Europe that Chrysler had rebadged as one of its own. Chrysler was trying a little harder these days, no doubt partly because of Wallace's many helpful suggestions as a rising stockholder in the company. Eagle was the American Import now, the exotic brand that came right from the good old USA. People were starting to make some sense of that now; Henry just grinned when he thought of all the dollars the new value of Chrysler stock would soon bring his way. Well, Mom and Dad's. But that meant Henry, too. And Connie. Where was she? Henry wanted to give her another rugburn like he'd done after Connie had interrupted his phone call the other day. Oh, how she'd cried. Henry had taken the merciless tongue-lashing that earned him from his father easily. It was worth it. Henry went on with his channel surfing, finally locating what he wanted; the History Channel. It was a documentary about that German war machine, the Tiger tank. Henry's eyes almost seemed to glow with some unholy light as he listened to the announcer talk about the tank's creation, how it had been crafted by the visionary, over-the-top and fear-no-enemy mind of Adolf Hitler. He'd wanted a tank bigger, better, best of any and all in the world. He had commanded, and Germany had followed. The announcer said all of this very matter-of-fact, but Henry saw right through it. Watching black-and-white footage of a Sherman tank's turret popping off like a cork as a Tiger shot it point blank with an 88mm shell, Henry knew even the narrator was awed. I could blow up the whole fucking world in that tank , Henry thought with a distant smile. \"Henry, Henry!\" Connie sang, bouncing into the room like she always seemed to do when she had something to say- especially something that was backed by one or both of her parents. That, she and he knew, made it a lot harder for Henry to override or ignore her. \"What?\" Henry snapped, trying to act like she was just some tacky little lamp that had learned to talk. Noticing right away that Henry was trying to ignore her, Henry bounded in front of the TV. \"Mom says I can watch 'Leave it to Beulah' before dinner tonight!\" Henry's eyes briefly flicked to the clock. It was close to dinner; about 5:00pm. They'd be having dinner at 6. Usually that show was scheduled earlier in the day, but sometimes it ran at night, or did an extra episode around or after dinnertime. It was almost like the programmers were trying to give the annoying little sister an excuse to stay up. \"Really?\" Henry said, making a mock face of delight. \"That's neat!\" \"It is !\" Connie said, putting her tongue out. \"And Mom says I can watch it today, so you can't stop me!\" Henry finally sighed, vowing to get the cassette tape for this documentary on the Tiger when it came out. That was just too awesome not to watch all the way through. \"May I have the remote?\" Connie asked with exaggerated courtesy. Flicking off the TV, Henry dropped it to the rug. Connie scowled and moved to pick it up, then looked at Henry reprovingly. \"Mom says you can't have your feet on the couch.\" \"Really?\" Henry asked, his voice light and mocking again. \"Do you think so ?\" \"Yes,\" Connie said, then turned around and plopped down on the rug, turning the TV back on and searching for the channel she wanted. She found it, and after ten minutes or so of some other program Henry could have cared less about- an avid Anglo-and-Francophile, Henry hardly ever watched any kids' TV shows from his own country. It was all condescending trash anyway, whereas Europe seemed to take its children just a little more seriously. The show- \"Leave it to Beulah\" started, a series from the fifties still being shown, much as \"Bewitched\" and \"The Twilight Zone\", along with \"Leave it to Haskell\", the latter two being Henry's favourites. But none of them were on right now, and Henry started clenching his jaw as Connie began singing quite badly, going along as the theme tune of the show started. Christ , Henry thought with venom, Am I really supposed to put up with this ? After perhaps half a minute, Henry decided he couldn't take it anymore. \"Connie,\" he said, his voice rising in warning, \"That's enough.\" Connie went right on singing off-key, like she hadn't heard. Henry's eyes narrowed dangerously as he stared at the back of his sister's head, and in an instant he was on his feet, lashing out with an expertly-placed kick that shoved Connie a foot away and knocked her over. \"Ow!\" Connie cried out, \"Hey!\" \"You don't ever ignore me when I'm talking!\" Henry barked at her. \"Not now, not ever! Never ! When I talk, you listen!\" Briefly, Henry remembered the last time he and Mark had talked, a couple days ago. Their last words to each other had mostly been about Connie. Mark had said, \"You just set her straight\", and Henry had chuckled warmly. \"You know I will.\" Well, he was certainly doing that now. \"I'm telling!\" Connie wailed, jumping up and running from the living room. \" Mom !\" Oh, boy , Henry thought, watching her go and then reluctantly following. In the kitchen, Susan had halted her work on preparing dinner and was already listening to her daughter's latest tale about big, mean Henry. Knowing he would soon be a wanted boy if he didn't show up on his own, Henry made his way towards the kitchen. This was gonna take a while. As a matter of fact, it took more than twenty minutes. For ten of that, Henry was sternly told to go to the kitchen table and just sit. Nothing more than that; Connie was calmed and sent back to the living room, and Henry sat there in silence. Finally, Susan sat down at the dining room table with two mugs; each held a fresh serving of hot chocolate. Carefully setting one down near Henry, Susan sat down with hers. She regarded her son seriously. \"Henry,\" she began carefully, \"You've been in a lousy mood lately. Dad and I think you're kind of grumpy, and you've been getting in a little trouble at school. And Connie?\" Susan looked at Henry with real curiosity. \"She watches that show all the time! You must have listened to her sing like that a dozen times before.\" Henry just gripped the warm mug with one hand, staring at the table and not saying anything. He was awfully close to telling the truth. And while that might not always be a bad thing for him to do- if only for virtue of its novelty- Henry wasn't sure what would happen if he just opened his mouth and let the truth come spilling out. The truth about what ? That was the problem with it. When Henry lied, he could craft it his own way, string everything together and set events up the way he wanted them known. Lies had to make sense. All the truth had to do was happen. \"Henry,\" Susan said, gently setting a hand on her son's, meeting his cool blue eyes with her hazel brown. \"Yes, Mom?\" Henry asked, keeping his voice even. \"What's wrong?\" Finally, Henry sighed. \"I think I miss Mark.\" Susan thought about that one for a moment. In a way, it actually explained a lot. Henry's behavior had been altered even before Mark's presence, during that two weeks mostly for the better. Afterwards, he'd grown short in temper and sullen in mood. Thinking about it, Susan realised that perhaps this was the result of Henry meeting his first real friend. It had taken years, and he'd never liked anybody as much as Mark before. During her meetings with Henry's teachers over the years, Susan had seen so many ways of trying to gently hide from a parent that their child, for whatever reason, was odd- and not well-liked. That was the view of his classmates, anyway, while Henry's teachers liked him just fine. Maybe Henry had just not been sure how to make friends. \"I guess that makes sense,\" she said after a few moments of silence. \"You two really seemed to click after that first week.\" \"Yeah,\" Henry said with a small smile. He took a sip of the hot chocolate. \"So you miss him?\" Henry nodded. \"Well,\" Susan said, \"I understand that, Henry. That makes a lot of sense. But you can't go taking it out on Connie. She likes Mark, too, but she isn't being mean to anybody because he's back in Arizona.\" Henry just nodded again, and said, \"Yeah, I know. Just wish he could be around more.\" \"Uncle Jack says they might visit in Easter,\" Susan said as she drank some of her own hot chocolate. \"Maybe you'll see him then.\" Her blonde-haired son's eyes lit up at that, and he looked across the table at her, the hope rather plain on his face. \"Think so, Mom?\" he asked, and Susan nodded. \"Don't see why not.\" Henry nodded a little, and visibly relaxed a little more. \"I'm sorry about being mean to everybody, Mom,\" he said in apology. \"I-I just miss Mark. I'm not sure what to do sometimes.\" \"Next time he calls,\" Susan suggested, \"Let him know how you're doing. I'm sure he wouldn't want you getting in trouble here because of how you miss having him around.\" Henry nodded after a moment, considering that. \"You're right, Mom,\" he said simply. Susan smiled a little. \"Of course I am. Now, I want you to go up to your room. Stay up there until dinner; Dad will be home by then. Make sure you apologize to Connie when you come downstairs before dinner.\" \"Yes, Mom,\" Henry said obediently, and after finishing his hot chocolate headed upstairs as he was told. Those two really did click , Susan thought again, and once more it occurred to her: Henry's never had a friend like that before . She'd never seen her son act quite like he had before or after Mark's visit; it was like Henry's cousin coming to visit had stirred a lot of things up in Henry's life, and now that he'd left again Henry was unsure of what to do now that Mark was absent. But Henry apologized very nicely to Connie, enough so that even his sister seemed a little impressed. He explained that he'd just been kind of grumpy lately, starting off a little uncertainly. Connie had greeted that first effort with a contemptuous huff, but Henry overlooked that- though with some visible effort- and went on to say he really liked having Mark around in December, and missed him now. He said he hadn't been thinking clearly today, and asked that Connie forgive him. She finally gave him a neutral look, warily remembering how upset he'd made her an hour earlier. \"You should be nice,\" Connie said finally. \"Like Mark.\" It was tough to suppress the smirk Henry felt coming when he heard that. One day soon, Connie might be in for a rude awakening. Mark wasn't quite such a momma's boy anymore. Dinner went fairly well- Connie and Henry treated each other with civility at least, and Wallace, who would find out about the incident between Henry and Connie later when Susan told him in their bedroom, seemed to sense nothing amiss. He talked with interest of his stockholding work, of how the market had been doing very well lately. Peugeot was talking about returning to the United States, possibly partnering up with Renault, Citroen and SEAT to do it. The French Big Three, and the chief carmaker of Spain teaming up to sell cars to the Americans. Hey, why not? Stranger things had happened. A call came for Henry after dinner, around 7:30pm. It had to be two hours before that in Arizona, perhaps just after dinnertime for Mark. Naturally, he wanted to talk to Henry- and while she usually liked to talk to Mark some too, Susan let this one go. It seemed like Mark was eager to talk, but only to Henry. That was fine, Susan figured as she called Henry downstairs and gave him the phone. The boys had a right to their own conversations sometimes. Her son promptly found one of the wireless sets and wandered into the living room, sitting calmly across the couch from his sister, who had fallen asleep watching \"Gilligan's Island\". Susan tried not to pay too much attention to Henry as he sat in the living room, but she cast a glance in there now and then as she passed by, carrying out various errands around the house. Mostly Susan just wanted to make sure that if Connie were to wake up the two wouldn't start fighting. But Henry didn't seem to be paying attention to her at all. Henry had his mind focused on Mark. This time around, though, the lively conversation that was taking place was mostly one-way. On this occasion, Mark had called because he just needed Henry to listen. And listen Henry did; it impressed Susan more than a little as she noticed what a good listener her son could be, if he only wanted to. He would say \"Yeah,\" or \"Really?\" now and then, the latter with noticeable interest. Finally, he spoke with such calm, even smug satisfaction Susan could all but see the smile on Henry's face. \"Good,\" came his voice from the living room. \"Very good.\" Henry wandered into the kitchen after a twenty-five minute call, visibly cheered and in a much better mood. \"Mark had a great day today,\" was all he would say, but got evasive when Susan tried to ask why. Returning to putting away some of the loaves of fresh imported French bread Wallace had brought home, Susan finally had to smile. Those boys and their secrets. Who knew what it was? Mark was thirteen now, working his way into the second semester of seventh grade. Maybe he'd met a girl. Upstairs that night, Henry lay in his bed and looked up at the ceiling, listening to the wind howl and the snow softly patter against the window outside. He could feel the cold radiating in from the nearby window; even in February, the nights were little different from December. This was Maine, after all- those weaklings in Georgia might expect the cold to go away by March or April, but in Maine the cold owned the winter the way South Carolina bowed to its summers- completely. The heat of Dixie and the cold of New England came and went when it liked. Henry was naked under his warm, soft covers, and now and then he shifted a little, delighting in the way the blankets and sheets felt to his bare skin. He was in great shape for twelve- he was one of the fastest, strongest boys in his class. Even the budding group of athletic, popular boys- and girls- couldn't ignore Henry's athletic talent, fit body and good looks. He might have been a bit on the weird side, but Henry had the right stuff to be popular. Most anybody could see that. But this wasn't about Henry. Not about him- not today. What kept Henry cheerful tonight- and would do so for the next day at least- was the news Mark had told him over the phone. Mark had been so excited, so thrilled at his success, he'd hardly stopped to let Henry get a word in. Normally, Henry hated that- it meant someone besides him was in control of the conversation, and for obvious reasons that just wouldn't do. But Mark, like with so many other things, was the exception here. Henry didn't mind listening if that was what Mark needed. Anything for a brother, right? And his brother had done particularly well back at his home in Arizona, on this particularly fine February day. He'd done himself- and his blonde cousin- proud. Sean Walters, who Henry recalled was an enemy of some kind to Mark, had been put solidly in his place today. Mark had beaten him in a fight- shut him down cold, one-on-one. Bloodied him up good, and socked a friend of his- Mark's- who'd tried to interfere. Elbowed him in the stomach so hard the other boy had puked. Two boys had displeased Mark, and both had paid the price. And Mark wasn't sorry at all. Well, nearly. He seemed to have some regret over elbowing his friend Alan Parks- enough that he called it an accident, anyway. And Henry thought it very strange that Mark said he'd picked this fight with the bully Sean Walters over a beating Sean had given Mark's friend Alan a week before. Henry wanted to ask why Mark even gave a shit, but decided not to- out of respect for Mark. Even so, he was rather curious about that. Mark had clearly enjoyed the day's events, was elated at the hurt he'd put on those two boys in some man-to-man combat. And he now recognized that both the bully and his friend were weak. Neither had what it took to see a fight- a real fight, and not some schoolyard pushy-pushy bullshit- through to the finish. Mark did now, and suddenly he was too much for these dorks. And as for curious little things like Mark still giving a shit about some friend of his? Leftovers, afterthoughts. Mark had come a long way since December 1993, but he still had progress left to go. What mattered to Henry, though, as that it seemed quite certain Mark would make it the rest of the way. Henry fell asleep with the covers tucked nicely around his neck, his blonde hair smoothed out neatly above his head as always. Conditioned and shampooed regularly, Henry's hair was getting to be rather high-maintenance, one of his silent indications that he really was starting to care- in some ways- about the opinions of others. Susan stopped by Henry's room at the end of the hall as she was coming upstairs for bed around 9; she was surprised, right away, by how calm and peaceful Henry looked. His face was calm, his eyes closed and his breathing deep and regular. Once he smiled, as if recalling something that made him very happy. He must have been tired, too- Henry normally was a bit of a light sleeper, somehow almost always able to tell if someone was watching him as he slept. But tonight, he had tucked himself in and conked out. Seeing that look on his face- the iconic look of a 12-year-old boy, worn out after a long day- Susan remembered last December. After that fight they'd had in the hospital, Mark and Henry had ended up not only riding home side-by-side in the van, but had within five minutes fallen asleep on each other's shoulders. They'd looked so calm, so unconcerned. From the moment she'd seen them in the rearview mirror to the moment she'd had to wake them at home, Susan had cursed herself for not bringing the camera. It was understandable as to why; with what had happened to Connie that day, her near-miss brush with death on the lake, it made a lot of sense that Susan did not have her camera. But had she known she'd see Henry and Mark like that, so clearly trusting in each other they were asleep with their heads on each other's shoulders, Susan would have had her camera. The best moments in life seemed to deliberately wait until cameras were out of film, in the shop, forgotten at home or in the car. Henry and Mark had just looked so sweet, so adorable- being boys, they would have squirmed under the seats had they heard a camera wind its shutter open. But Susan hadn't had her camera, so the issue hadn't come up. It really was too bad. That would have been a picture worth keeping, all right. Back in his room, Henry shifted in his sleep now and then, his thoughts a pleasant haze and his feelings warm and peaceful. He was getting some of the best sleep he'd had in days, and he knew it was due to Mark. His cousin- no, brother- had won a great victory today. He'd stood up to a bully and told him that he was no longer going to be a victim. He would never, ever again be caught defenseless. It had made Henry smile with pride then, and he smiled again in his sleep now. Great work, Mark , Henry thought at one point in a dream, where he saw himself at a soccer game in Arizona, listening proudly as Mark was cheered on to a crushing victory over the other team. Great work. Miss you, man .[Chapter 8] Chapter VIII- Playing Games Mark returned to school the next day in a remarkably good mood. He'd won his first fistfight- won it against a bully, hands-down. And he'd taken care of Alan Parks, when the lanky ginger had tried to get in the way. It was unfortunate- sort of- but Mark had done what he had to do. And as he arrived at school that Thursday, Mark found himself looking for Alan with a calm, expectant feeling as he made his way through the milling crowd of kids on the bus ramp. Alan rode a different bus to and from school, but they shared a table at lunch. Mark would surely see him then. He even had it all made out in his mind, just how things would go. Alan, having gone home and had some time to calm down and think about things, would approach Mark sometime today. Maybe in one of the classes they shared, perhaps at lunch. But before 3:45pm today, Alan Parks would thank Mark for the help he'd been yesterday. Mark, of course, didn't mean to hold this over Alan- much- or to expect any sort of compensation for his generosity- yet. For today, all he wanted was to hear those two simple words: \"Thank you\", and Mark intended to behave with magnanimity as he heard them. He would nod, smile a little and shrug. It was no big deal; after all, what were friends for? Mark also watched for Sean throughout the morning, and was pleasantly surprised to find he didn't show up. What he was able to gather through questioning certain other students was that Sean had apparently stayed home today; the story was he was sick or something. The attitude he sensed, however, was that many disbelieved this- jerks like Sean seemed blessed with remarkable good health, in a way not unlike a cockroach. He was just too resilient to be kept home for such a reason. Skipping was another matter, but his two best friends, Eric and Chad, were about as puzzled as anyone else- that possibility looked unlikely this time. Gradually talk also circulated that Mark, who was looking a little rough around the edges despite some good sleep and a shower, had something to do with Sean's absence at school today. No one from the administration came to question Mark about it, and Mark was grateful. Given his complete lack of concern over Sean's condition, Mark might have said something flippant if asked about him. Something hilarious to him, but the school brass might not have shared Mark's sense of humor. Nothing specific was said to Mark at all about these rumors; but some girls and guys of all three grades at junior high gave Mark a new once-over, as if re-evaluating him and the status he was to hold at school. If the rumor really was true- if some of the clues and details being put together by the school grape-vine runners were accurate- Mark was due a promotion. He was starting to walk, talk and act like a boy much more deserving of people's attention- and if he'd won a fight with someone as big as Sean Walters, that attention might well be deserved. The day didn't go quite like Mark had expected, though he certainly liked being the new cowboy on campus for a day. People paid more attention to him in class, in the halls- some with fear, some with respect. Mark didn't mind any of that- but he did mind the treatment he got from Alan Parks. The two normally sat near each other in their morning science class, and in history just before lunch. But in each class, Mark was more than surprised to see Alan come in without a word to him, then take a seat across the room and ignore him throughout the class. Mark tried to catch him after history class, but Alan just shook him off and hurried away. The pattern continued at lunch, where Mark saw Alan head to another table, one a few tables over from the group he and Mark normally sat with, and stay there throughout the 20 minutes of lunch. Mark was not only baffled, he felt insulted. What did Alan think he was doing, snubbing Mark today of all days? And friends of theirs noticed it, and were rather puzzled- Mark started to get irritable when they gave him a bit of a ribbing for it. He was being ignored by a friend who, like it or not, owed him something- at the very least, owed Mark those two words of thanks. This was not funny. Wesley, on the other hand, certainly seemed to think so. A lanky boy with a head of wavy, hazel-brown hair that hung low over his eyes in strands, Wesley was an energetic boy and the self-established joker of Mark's group of friends. He was well-liked by most students at his school, but like many jokers, Wesley was sometimes hampered by an inability to tell when his humor was not only failing to amuse, but starting to cause anger. Once in a while he would get pushed or yelled at, and the puzzled look on his face that followed was one of real, true confusion. But Wesley bounced back, always- and if he found someone was not in a good mood that day, or didn't like his jokes any day, he simply noted it and avoided them. Mark was really in no mood for Wesley's jokes that day, and when Wesley sat down he knew what was coming. Wesley, however, did not- he wasn't really aware of the new Mark he was dealing with now. \"Hey, hey !\" Mark looked up from his tray, where he'd been a corn dog nugget at some ketchup he had on the paper plate. Sitting down across from him was Wesley; the class joker was wearing his usual jeans and striped t-shirt with ABERCROMBIE or whatever written on it. He was fond of those brand-name, stereotypical-teenager-t-shirts. Mark found that kind of annoying- but noted that perhaps he ought to start paying better attention to the arbitrary school fashion trends that guys like Wesley were, somehow, so well in tune with. \"Hey, Wesley,\" Mark said, hoping the other kid would just take his seat, eat his food and pay attention to somebody else. \"Hey, big man!\" Wesley grinned, sitting down and tossing a nugget from his plate to Mark's. When the other boy, he with the piercing blue eyes and the auburn hair, looked at him questioningly, Wesley just went right on grinning. \"So you don't hurt me . I don't want the new school badass beatin' me up, you know?\" Normally, Mark would have laughed at this, or at least smiled in appreciation. Wesley never mocked out of cruelty or for kicks, but he did have a great gift for poking fun at people. Mark was not happy about being snubbed by Alan, and he had a sense this wasn't just going to be for today. This might take a week or more to blow over. \"Come on, Wesley,\" Mark said, trying to ignore him. \"Give it a rest, man.\" Wesley just giggled, batting his hair out of his eyes. The joke was he would sometimes almost walk into lockers, cars, trees and plenty of other things- but it was a small price to pay for that lovely haircut. \"I hope you give Sean a rest, dude. Man!\" Wesley said, chuckling and looking around at the other guys at the table. \"I didn't know you were the type , Mark! What happened, man? Your dick grow a few inches?\" Mark wanted to nod in the affirmative, but frankly that hadn't become much of a concern yet. He was thirteen, yes, but his body was mostly under the belief he was 12 years old still. Mark was sure- somehow- that when the time came, Mother Nature would be quite generous to him below the waist. That, however, was none of Wesley's damned business- and Mark did not at all care for the way Wesley was asking. It sounded, to say the least, like he was skeptical of that possibility. \"Well, wouldn't you like to know, Wesley?\" Mark said indifferently, hoping his tone would cause the other kid to lose interest and bother someone else. But Wesley was cheered by the appreciative guffaws of some of the other guys at the table. He suddenly got a wide-eyed, clearly theatrical look of surprise on his face. \"Woah!\" Wesley exclaimed, as if noticing the fading bruise on Mark's right cheekbone for the first time. \"What happened to your face, man?\" What happened next- most importantly why- was almost anyone's guess. There was a sudden scraping sound as Mark stood up from his chair, and a crashing sound as Wesley's was thrown out from under him. With remarkable speed, Mark grabbed the other kid as his chin banged down painfully on the table, yanking him back up by two handfuls of his shirt. He pulled the lanky boy across the table until their noses almost touched. Wesley was breathing hard, panting rapidly almost like a hamster. \"Is something the matter with my face?\" Mark snarled, daring the other boy to keep up his stupid act. Now Nicholas Wesley really did look surprised. In fact, looking at Mark's coldly furious eyes, dragged across his own tray with ketchup and spilled milk decorating his front, Wesley got a little scared. \"N-no! No, y-y-you look fine!\" \"You sure ?\" \"Yes!\" Mark pulled Wesley a little closer; many pairs of eyes outside of his own table were silently watching. \"What's my name, asshole? Is it man, or dude? What?\" Panting even more like an overexcited gerbil, Wesley almost froze. \"It's Mark,\" he said, and the other boy threw him back in his seat. \"Try to remember it sometime,\" Mark snapped, sitting back down. He soon became aware of the many eyes still staring at him, and got up. Before turning away, though, he looked at Wesley, who was staring at him, wide-eyed, sprawled out in his seat. \"Fucking clean this shit up,\" Mark said, waving a hand dismissively at the mess of spilled milk and smeared ketchup on Wesley's tray. He then turned and grabbed his backpack, shouldering it and walking away. Behind him, he could hear Wesley say in a shaky voice, \"Mark's a sensitive man, guys.\" Mark's mind could offer only one answer to that. Fucking-A . The next couple of days were similar, but at the same time very different. Mark's friends were definitely more respectful around him now, and Wesley was very cautious about including Mark in any of his jokes. The lanky boy sat at the other end of the table now, and was grateful that Mark left him alone as long as he wasn't included in any jokes. It made Wesley nervous, though, and a little sad- he remembered Mark as somebody who liked his sense of humor, and didn't mind being poked fun at once in a while. Maybe he was just having a bad week- or, if some of the things Wesley was hearing were true, a bad month. Or two months. Mark was generally a bit more short-tempered these days. He wasn't with everybody; for example, more than one kid had noticed the jocks at school giving Mark an easier time in PE class. He was doing better these days, holding his own in more than just soccer. The end of the week wasn't long in coming. That whole time, Alan and Mark performed this awkward game of avoiding each other, or when they couldn't just pretending the other didn't exist. Mark noted with some pleasure, however, the fact that Alan was avoiding him; he, Mark, sat at the same table, occupied the same seat in classes they shared. Alan was the one moving and trying to avoid him. Mark was annoyed, and vowed not to forget Alan's failure- thus far- to thank him for taking Sean Walters out of their lives for a day. By Friday, Sean had been back for a few days, but he kept away from Alan and Mark, and overall didn't bother kids as much as he usually would have. Many of the school's downtrodden rejoiced, and Mark gained some hero status in the eyes of many of the smaller boys. When he became aware of this, Mark smiled and nodded, accepting the newfound adoration of these weaker boys- but inwardly starting to wonder if Sean didn't have the right idea. Not in the way he did it; Sean was a rather stupid boy, relying too much on what muscle he possessed and not enough on real finesse or skill in fighting. He also lacked vision. Sean was just interested in making weaker kids fear him, in putting them down so he felt bigger and better. The only thing he gained, aside from that, was small amounts of money when he shook a kid down for his lunch money. Mark, instead, accepted the thanks and secret admiration of these weaker boys. For one thing, they might not always be weak forever, and even if Mark chose to beat a kid or two up now and then- something he would have never even considered before meeting Henry- he would still have the admiration of his junior high school's weak boys. Just so long as he was, overall, better than Sean, they'd pick Mark any day of the week. And with the end of the week came the first game of the spring season. The Calvin A. Harris Junior High School soccer team was in the off season now, with only a handful of games to play before the end of the school year. Today's game was against the David Panning Middle School's Tigers. The Wildcats of Harris Junior High had good prospects for winning; they'd been training steadily even in the off season, and they had a great team, with no small number of boys who played for love of the sport and had a clear future with it. Coach Gates was a competent coach, good at discerning the best and fiercest of his boys, and bringing their talent to the forefront. Today, on this balmy February Friday, Mark Evans was one of those boys. He'd been hitting the field lately as if he was training for the World Cup, and came awfully close to getting a foul called on him during more than one practice. In the locker room, more than one of the guys razzed Mark about his newfound spirit- and for the new firmness and strength he was gaining about his arms, chest and stomach. There wasn't much fat on Mark ever, but he was just beginning to turn truly muscular for the first time. Mark, smirking at the compliments he knew he was being given, just shrugged it off and took it all in stride. His workouts at home, in the quiet of his room at night before going to bed, were starting to pay off. Henry had advised him it was something both of them would want to start paying attention to; fitness and strength was important for many reasons, and in more than one way junior high was just that- the training ground for the real thing. Less petty bullshit, more cars and parties. More independence . That was when stuff really got interesting, but junior high was a good way of getting ready for that. Before the game, Mark bantered back and forth with the rest of the boys, enjoying the new status he was starting to hold. The team's stronger, more popular players were taking him more seriously now, and Alan Parks couldn't do much besides watch. In the past, he and Mark had both been defensive players; now, Mark was on the offense. The tall, black-haired Jake Schwarz had liked Mark's new aggressiveness, and even half-jokingly suggested that Mark tip things in the Wildcats' favour by taking the risk of a foul to hurt somebody. Mark had grinned at that suggestion while the boys talked and joked in the locker room, in a way Alan Parks very much didn't like. Whereas most boys would have just laughed the suggestion off and left it at that, Mark for once looked like he wanted to do it. Mark's new dedication to all things physical paid off well on the soccer field; he started the February 15th game on the field, initially a midfielder but soon shifted to full-time offense as a forward. Mark was casting a cold grin or two at the opposing team the game got started at 4:30pm, a full forty-five minutes after the end of 7th hour. His heart sang as the adrenaline began hitting his system, as he sprinted about all over the field, shifting forward and backward with remarkable ease. A fine sheen of sweat soon coated his body, and Mark's heart pounded as he battled the Tigers for possession of the ball for a full twenty minutes. There was a brief time out as both teams talked strategy with their coaches; Coach Gates was quite pleased with Mark for having scored their first goal of the game in the first ten minutes. It had been too easy, really; Mark just worked with Jake to break through the Tigers' defense, sending it rapidly back and forth between the two of them. Then, taking a pass from Jake, Mark had broken out into the open and sent the ball on to the goal with such speed the goalie hesitated, considering diving out of the way. His hesitation meant the ball got in easily, and they resumed the first half with Mark's team in the lead. Typical of junior high students, most of CHJH's student body didn't care too much about the soccer team's game today. They headed home when classes ended, indifferent to the outcome of the game. But some stayed to watch, and plenty of parents of boys from both teams were there in the stands. Jack Evans was there, always determined to show support for his son. For once, though, Mark seemed to have no need for it; though he was sweating and breathing hard, Mark seemed to keep driving himself harder and harder, blasting through the defense countless times during the first half. He scored one more goal during the first forty-five minutes, sweat soaking his auburn hair as he yelled with joy, slapping sweaty palms with the other offensive boys and pumping a fist in the air. Up in the stands, more than just parents were watching Mark's new, fiery and relentless drive on the field with interest. A few girls from his grade- or the 6th and 8th- were watching, noticing as if for the first time how cute the Evans boy was. He was no pillar of teenage might- not yet, it might have been better to say- but he had finesse, skill, and damn if he didn't have fire. Mark played like he was trying to drive the enemy clear off the field, to break their spirit and make them call it a day. More than once Coach Gates had to caution him, to urge him to scale back some of his aggressiveness; the referees had come awfully close to calling a foul on him more than once this game, the first time even that had happened for Mark. That ended up happening in the final moments of the first half. Mark was pursuing Number Nine, one of the better offensive players for the Tigers, as the boy lead an effort to push through the Wildcat's defenses and even up the score. The two were right near each other, practically running side by side. Mark, knowing there was a fifty-fifty chance he'd get caught, took Jake's advice. He deliberately crossed his right leg in front of the Number Nine boy's left, and it worked about as well as he could've hoped. Nine went down hard, crying out in pain as something unpleasant happened to his left knee. Mark made sure to go down too, but he rolled, recovered, and was on his feet and away just as the whistle blew. Pointing at Mark as the boys all halted, one of the refs took out a yellow card and held it up. Mark shouted in protest, as did Jake Schwarz, who secretly was thrilled at the pained wail he'd heard from the other team's player. That boy was probably going to have to sit out the game, and while he wasn't their best player, he was a long way from their worst. Mark had done the Wildcats a good service today- and to hell with whether it was fair. Jake Schwarz played to win. In the stands, Jack almost forgot about the score, nearly forgot all about being pleased that his son was doing well on the field, scoring goals and really making a difference for his team. As the first half ended, Jack was just stunned. Mark had gotten a foul. He'd gotten a foul ! It might have been an accident that he tripped that other boy; after all, they'd both gone down together. But Mark had gotten up awfully quick, and seen that his team retook possession of the ball with a single-mindedness that made Jack wonder if he'd even noticed the injury he'd caused to the other player's knee. It wasn't severe- probably just a strained muscle or something similar- but Number Nine of the Tigers limped off the field at the end of the first half, and didn't look likely to come back this game. Mark, meanwhile, was heatedly discussing the end of the first half with his buddies on the team- many of them new buddies apparently, as Jack had been unaware Mark and Jake Schwarz were such good buddies before. Another person was at the game, watching Mark with no small amount of interest. Sean Walters, Eric Parker and Chad Few were all watching the game, making sure to stay off to the side and away from where Mark might look up and see them. Sean had talked Chad and Eric into this; he was sure that Mark would want to walk home on a balmy day like this, and that he'd very likely go alone given the sudden rift between him and Alan Parks. It was a setup, too good a chance for payback to be believed- or to pass up. And Mark would be tired, worn out from the game- between that and the simple fact that it was one on three, there was no way at all Mark Evans could win. Sean felt pleased as he watch that little auburn-haired twerp run himself ragged all over the field as the second half began, charging the enemy's defense like George Patton was his coach. Number Thirteen on the Wildcats was really giving it his all today, and Sean noted this with a smile, knowing it would mean he would have less to give later. However, something about Mark's manner made him pause, just the same as it did for Jack Evans and a few others. Mark was sweating hard, breathing hard, playing hard- but he didn't seem to be getting all that tired. The more worked up he got, the harder he played, and his reserve of energy seemed endless. Nobody had ever seen Mark so lively before; he was not one of the lightweights like he'd been. He was out there, hitting the field with the best on either team, not even caring about the two penalty kicks he handed the other team because of his play in the second half. The refs didn't like this Evans boy at all; he seemed like he was just aching to come right out and be insubordinate, instead of just secretly smug and insolent. He seemed to think every penalty he earned was a compliment- a signal, perhaps, that he was doing his job well. Even so, he walked the line carefully enough that the yellow card he got was it, the only major foul he committed all game. Mark cheered and yelled at the game's end; it was a near-shutout, with a final score of 50-20. The boy with the smooth auburn hair and the piercing blue eyes was the most hated- and loved- player on the Wildcats' soccer team that day. The Tigers went home cursing his name, but Jake Schwarz and his boys praised it all the more. Alan Parks avoided taking part in much of the celebrating that followed in the locker room, Mark's playful fighting with Jake and the other 8th grade boys just reinforcing Alan's feeling that Mark Evans was very possibly turning into a jerk. Outside in the bleachers, Sean and his buddies got up and left as the game ended, carefully noting the conversation the Evans kid seemed to be having with his dad. Mark was elated at having won, and even more so at having achieved a new personal triumph by scoring three goals- the most he'd ever done in a game. Mr. Evans was proud, impressed at his son's performance- but perhaps, also concealing a bit of unease over Mark's newfound aggressiveness. Mark didn't seem to know this was just a middle school soccer game, not as clearly as he used to. If he played, he played to win, and that was it. There wasn't anything wrong with that philosophy, per se- but it was not one Jack Evans was used to seeing in Mark. Regardless, as Sean, Eric and Chad hung back to observe the conversation, hidden at a distance among the departing crowd, they soon saw what they wanted. Jack headed off to his Wrangler in the parking lot, and Mark returned to the locker room to shower, change and most importantly of all, walk home. That had been just what Sean was waiting for. As he and his two friends walked across the grassy lawn surrounding Calvin Harris Junior High, heading for the woods out back where Mark would likely go, Sean gingerly touched a hand to his nose. Mark hadn't broken anything during that fight early this week, but he had bruised a lot. And where Sean's nose was concerned, Sean had a feeling that Evans kid had come close- even now his nose was still sore. Plenty of time to pay him back for that , Sean thought. \"Dude,\" Eric said, \"you sure he's gonna go this way?\" \"Yeah, man,\" Chad added, \"What if he doesn't show?\" \"He'll show,\" Sean said, shifting his backpack on his shoulders as they headed for the edge of the woods. \"Look, after Tuesday-\" \"After he kicked your ass,\" Chad said with a smirk, as Eric sniggered. Sean's face heated some, but he kept his voice level as he continued, \"After Tuesday , that dork Evans thinks he's got me scared of him now. You've seen him. He's walking around like he's got a ten inch cock all of a sudden.\" \"Yeah,\" Chad said with a nod, remembering his own observations of the past week. \"It's pretty fucking annoying.\" \"Twerps like him need to mind their place,\" Eric said. \"Well,\" Sean said with a smile, \"today we're gonna fix that for Mark. We're nice guys, really. We wanna help him.\" Sean's mind turned suddenly, though, to another side of the situation he was facing. Three-on-one odds made victory certain, and Mark Evans would surely be taught a lesson in humility today. One he'd never forget. But while Chad and Eric didn't much like Mark Evans either, and had readily enough agreed to help Sean beat him up after school, Sean knew he hadn't heard the last of them on this one. They'd give him grief over it for the rest of this year for sure- maybe for longer than that. Sean didn't like that idea- these two were hard enough to keep in line as it was. But Sean also knew that the help he had today was necessary. As much as he hated to admit it, he no longer felt safe taking on Mark Evans by himself. So he'd arranged for some help, and was willing to pay the price that came with it. Anything would be worth it, just as long as the beating Mark Evans got today convinced him to stop strutting around school like he was Clint Eastwood. Anything at all.[Chapter 9] Chapter IX- Round Two \"See you, Jake,\" Mark called, shouldering his backpack as he walked out of the soccer field's locker room. He cast a glance at the two 'victory cigarettes' he and Jake had smoked after the others had left; tough and mature beyond his years, Jake was one of the only boys Mark knew on the team who really seemed to like it as a habit, rather than as some bullshit façade to impress friends with. Jake, setting off for the parking lot and his home a few blocks away, waved back. His green eyes were alive and cheerful beneath his buzz-cut of black hair, and he smiled, genuinely pleased with not only Mark's performance today, but the new kid he was becoming. Some of the older, more popular boys were really starting to wonder about Mark Evans now. If, perhaps, they hadn't been wrong about him before. In past years, Jake had laughed at Mark sometimes. Never directly pushed him around, but he hadn't stopped any of it either. Mark was a nice kid, smart- he had potential. But he was too moralistic, too cautious- in short, too much of a wuss. Not many of the cool kids wanted to hang out with somebody like that. But now? Mark was starting to become somebody Jake really liked. The older boy's eyebrows had gone up more than a little when not only had Mark taken part in the celebratory play-fighting and roughhousing after the game, but he'd been the one who suggested to Jake that the team captain and star offense player have a smoke after the game. \"I didn't think you were the type, Mark,\" Jake had remarked with a smile. The Evans kid had just shrugged at that, a casual gesture with a slight smirk on his face. \"I'm learning the habit,\" he said. And indeed, so he had- the two had just sat there in the locker room, towels around their shoulders, breathing the tobacco in and out nice and regular. Jake tried not to admit to himself that he was studying Mark's chest and shoulders, but here after the game, he was again impressed- Mark Evans wasn't such a wimp anymore. He really was starting to look like somebody to reckon with. Thus far nobody had seem him in the weight room at school or in any gyms around the area, but a determined individual could make a fair amount of progress all by himself. That certainly seemed the case with Mark. As Jake headed home, he made a note to include Mark on his team of jocks next time there was a game in PE class. Mark looked like he might be up to their standards now. Meanwhile, Mark ground out the cigarette butts and tossed them in a trash can, then shifted his backpack over his shoulders and began the walk home. He wasn't entirely sure why he wanted to walk home himself today; maybe it was just so he could smoke another cigarette out in the woods. Mark did like the feeling of being a rebellious kid, a rule-breaking teenager, that doing that gave him. He also liked the feel of the nicotine, and of course, the connection it gave him with Henry. Both boys secretly smoked a cigarette now and then, and Mark's first smoke had been with Henry. It was an odd way for the two of them to begin to bond, but Henry didn't do things like most boys. And, these days, neither did Mark. Walking steadily and calmly, Mark took a deep breath as he walked across the grassy field behind the school, glancing up at the white clouds scattered around the blue sky. That cigarette had felt good; so had smoking it with Jake Schwarz, captain of the soccer team and one of the coolest kids in school. Mark had felt very nervous taking out his pack and lighter as the other boys began to head home, offering Jake a chance to hang back and smoke. But Jake, though visibly startled, had accepted- and talked with Mark casually, in a way that Mark felt like he was really gaining a chance to step up and have some cool friends. Guys like Wesley and Alan Parks might not suffice for much longer. Even if Alan Parks did get around to thanking Mark- an act that would soon be a full week overdue- he was still a sissy. Mark, walking past the edge of the treeline and into the woods behind the junior high school, couldn't make sense of it. All he was doing was repeating the process of what Henry had done for him. Break down the old barriers, teach him to forget that old fearful and cautious nature. It just wasn't worth it. You had to take risks if you wanted to live any sort of life worth talking about. Alan hadn't learned that yet. If he would only open his mind and listen, he would learn it from Mark- just as Mark had learned from Henry. Mark felt real gratitude towards his cousin when he thought of his impatience with Alan's fearfulness and hesitation. Had Mark ever really been that much of a wuss? Henry must have been holding onto his patience with both hands sometimes. But Henry had resolved to be patient, to stick with Mark and not quit on him. Mark, meanwhile, decided he'd at least give Alan another chance. He'd try to help Alan, get him moving along the path towards real manhood. But if Alan refused? Well, Mark might just find a new punching bag. He smiled savagely at the idea; the memory of Alan Parks puking his guts out a few days ago was kind of funny. Mark was so preoccupied with his thoughts about Alan Parks, about Henry, and about Jake Schwarz and winning the soccer game today, that he hardly even noticed the kid standing there was he passed by one particularly large tree. \"Mark, my man,\" Sean Walters said in a casual, cheerful voice. \"What's up?\" \"I thought I smelled a bitch,\" Mark said, trying out one of the new words Henry had taught him in their back-and-forth phone calls as he turned around. Sean normally would have flushed in embarrassment, or anger- he was not used to the scrawny dorks of this school talking back to him like that. But nothing that little wiseass Evans said was gonna bother him. Not today. \"Hey, Mark,\" Eric said, stepping out from behind another tree- he'd stayed out of sight behind it as Mark had passed by. Chad came into view from another tree, and now the three 8th grade boys formed a triangle around Mark, still some ten feet away but closing slowly. Each wore that same lazy, confident smile- like the fight was just a formality and the three of them had already won. Ignoring Eric and Chad, Mark turned back to Sean, who stood back with his arms crossed and a grin on his face, savouring the moment. \"Three on one, huh?\" Mark breathed, his voice growing tense as he prepared for the fight to come. \"Those odds don't sound stacked enough for you, Sean. Why don't you just run home to your mommy ? We both know you want to.\" Now Sean's grin vanished, and his face did flush in embarrassment. He'd had enough of this. Gesturing furiously at Mark, Sean yelled, \"Get 'im!\" and both Chad and Eric waded in with raised fists. After a moment, Sean moved in himself. For just a moment or two after Sean gave the order, Mark was still. It seemed like he had just frozen in place, somehow unable to movie. The three boys around him smiled, taking this as reason for encouragement. Perhaps the little Evans twerp had frozen out of fear, and all he could really do well was talk a good game. And play soccer, which to good old, all-American boys like Sean, Chad and Eric was a sissy's game anyway. Chad began to laugh as he moved in, amazed at how Mark was still not moving. He was still laughing when Mark spun around, lashing out with a backwards kick at Chad and slammed his palm into Eric's chest. Both boys were thrown back, hitting the ground hard and gasping for air- and wondering what the hell had just happened. Sean, meanwhile, wasn't playing any games this time. His eyes widened in fear when he saw Mark strike out against two opponents at once, but that was just more of his fancy karate gimmicks. Sean had muscle, and fists plenty big enough to teach this Evans kid some manners. He was stronger than Mark; all Sean needed to do was close in and prove it. Mark turned around after a glance at Sean, suddenly very interested as Eric and Chad struggled to get up. \"All right, jerkoff,\" Sean snarled, grabbing Mark in a headlock. \"There goes your ass!\" He was gonna strangle this little dork. Beat him up, stomp him good in the nuts, choke him unconscious- and then just leave him out here, and let him sort out the mess after Sean and his buddies dumped his backpack out and tossed its contents all over the woods. Suddenly, though, just as Sean got an arm around Mark's neck, he whipped an arm back, driving an elbow into Sean's stomach. Blinding pain filled Sean's vision, and he gasped hard, staggering back and trying hard not to puke. Suddenly, a figure charged into his field of vision, and in an instant Sean was slammed backwards, thrown to the ground. A foot planted on his chest, and Sean looked up to see Mark Evans, standing above him with a flushed, sweaty grin of triumph on his face. \"I could break your nose now,\" Mark taunted, exulting in the power he now wielded in hand-to-hand fighting. He hoped he could get in a fight like this every day. Mark considered, raising his foot. \"Too bad, Sean,\" he said, knowing just how to hit the kid's face and break his nose. \"That was such a handsome nose.\" Sean, stunned by the vicious blow his head had taken when he hit the ground, struggled to rise, but Mark just slammed him down again and lifted his foot a second time. \" Yaaaaah !\" Chad flew in from the right in an expert tackle, grabbing Mark Evans about the legs as the two crashed to the ground. The younger boy began to struggle fiercely, and Chad yelled at Sean and Eric. \"Come on, guys!\" he shouted, \"Get over here!\" \"Get your hands off me, mother fucker !\" Mark yelled, fighting to break free. He rocked from side to side, trying to throw Chad off; sitting up and pinning Mark down, Chad held on with grim determination. If Mark broke free now, anything could happen. This kid was a fighter. After just moments, though, Sean got to his feet and hurried over, breathing hard as he drew back a shoe and slammed it into Mark's head. The younger boy shouted in pain and anger, but Sean just kicked him again, grinding some dirt in for good measure. Mark kept up his fierce battle for freedom, but Eric came over then. His freckled face was flushed and angry, and he barked, \"Pick him up!\" at Sean and Chad. Sean almost refused; he was the boss of this group! But he had a good feeling about what Eric wanted to do. Kicking Mark in the ear yet again, Sean was pleased to note the repeated kicks to the head had stunned Mark a little, disoriented him somewhat. He wasn't fighting quite so well now. Grabbing one of his arms, Sean and Chad forced him to his feet. Without any witty comment or pause for effect, Eric shot out a foot and kicked Mark Evans between his legs. Sean and Chad let go and laughed as the Evans kid collapsed, curling up reflexively and clutching his privates. \"Not so tough now , are ya?\" Sean breathed, and kicked Mark hard in the ribs. \"No more funny jokes? No more big talk?\" Sean kicked Mark again. He grunted in pain, struggling to rise, but Eric just stomped on his leg, pinning it down. Chad kicked him in the stomach, and from there the melee began. Get up, asshole ! Mark could hear his cousin's voice in his mind. So clearly, in fact, it was like Henry was yelling in his hear. He remembered their first sparring match, the first time Henry had told Mark he needed to toughen him up, teach him how to fight. You have to keep moving , Henry had said. In a fight you have to keep moving, never stop moving, otherwise you're dead . The auburn-haired boy fought to get up, but blows came at him hard and fast, soon from every direction as the three 8th graders circled him, kicking and punching at will. The pain rolling around in his balls was excruciating, and Mark just couldn't make any effort to stand get anywhere. As soon as they saw his legs moving, trying to get his feet standing flat again, the older boys just pinned his legs down and kept going. Keep moving ! Henry's voice yelled, but Mark balled up and put his hands over his head, feeling rage and humiliation as he cowered there in the dirt. He wanted to fight back, to keep moving because to stand still in a fight was to know death. It was what he had to do… yet Mark couldn't. He balled up, shielding himself from the blows as best he could. Eventually- finally- they stopped. There was a zipping sound as each one of the compartments in Mark's backpack was opened, and it was promptly turned over and dumped out on the ground. Eric and Chad began tossing notebooks, textbooks and writing utensils to the four winds, but Chad grinned as he picked out a golden-cased Zippo and a pack of Camels. He knelt by Mark, who was still balled up in the dirt, taking care to grind a little more of it onto the boy's upturned, bleeding right ear with his shoe. \"Thanks for the cigarettes, asshole,\" Sean said. \"You got a nice lighter.\" The other two boys laughed, and after a time they got bored and left. Mark waited a few minutes, just breathing and letting the pain fade, before he stood up. He groaned as he did so, and it took some real effort to stand upright- that blow to his special place had caused a special agony that faded slowly, reluctantly, and did not look like it was leaving anytime soon. Every inch of Mark ached; he had dirt all over him, and he could tell he was probably scratched, bruised and bleeding in more than a handful of places. Mark wanted a cigarette, but then he remembered his pack was gone. And his lighter. And his books and everything else were scattered all over the damn woods now. Mark swore violently as he gathered his things, brushed off what dirt he could and began to limp home. This day had gotten shitty real fast. At home, Mark paused at the door. He knew his appearance would give away what happened. There was dirt all over his jeans and t-shirt, and his face was grimy. His left ear was sore, probably with blood still drying on it. Any fool could tell Mark had just been in a fight, and lost. Mark made his way inside quietly, hoping he'd be left alone. Unfortunately, after today's win, it was enough that Jack had let his son walk home- he'd been rather surprised at that, but allowed it since Mark did sometimes like walking. Jack had been working in his office, waiting for his son to come home. When he heard the door shut, Jack got up and hurried over to the front door. Mark was late getting back- as much as half an hour later than Jack had expected him to return. Maybe he'd just liked t take his time- or maybe something had come up. In any case, Jack made his way to the front door, and was shocked by what he saw when he got there. The boy with the auburn hair, Number Thirteen on the school soccer team, was a mess. His red t-shirt was caked with dirt on the front, and his jeans were mottled with it as well. Mark's face, grimy and dirty with dried blood on his right ear, was grim. He wore a sullen, bitter expression, and upon seeing his father really had very little to say. Nothing at all, in fact. He just stood there, having already guessed he had missed his chance to go upstairs to his room, unmolested. \"Mark!\" Jack exclaimed, rushing to him. \"Mark, what happened ? Are you all right, is everything okay? What happened ?\" \"Nothing,\" Mark lied. But Jack just shook his head, not fooled for a moment. \"Mark,\" he said seriously, \"Something obviously happened. You're half an hour late getting back, and anybody could see there's a reason why.\" Mark just stared bitterly around his father, avoiding his eyes. \" Nothing happened,\" Mark repeated, wishing his dad would just drop it and leave it alone. Jack suddenly got an idea, and an angry look sparked in his eyes. \"Was it that bully again? Sean Walters?\" Mark said nothing, which to Jack was just as good as a \"Yes\". Kneeling in front of Mark and setting his hands on Mark's shoulders- they were getting a little stronger every day, it seemed- Jack looked right at Mark, right into those blue eyes that were so intently avoiding his. \"Mark,\" the elder Evans said seriously, \"This is serious . If you keep letting these things happen, no part of it's gonna do you any good. I mean it.\" \"I can take care of myself, Dad,\" Mark said tersely, looking him in the eyes for the first time since he'd come inside. Jack shook his head. \"There's nothing wrong with asking for help on this, Mark,\" he said. \"This kid is gonna hurt you if you don't put a stop to it.\" I'm trying , Mark thought angrily, and he very much intended to put a stop to it. But Mark knew his way- Henry's way, before that- was not going to be something Jack would want to hear. He would call that fighting fire with fire, playing the bully's game. Mark thought that just fine, but knew his father wouldn't. When Mark didn't say anything else and just went on standing there and looking angry, Jack stood up. He was resolved that something be done about this. \"I'm gonna give the school a call tomorrow, Mark,\" Jack said. \"We're gonna put a stop to this. Sean's gonna have to leave you alone for good.\" \"I can take care of myself !\" Mark exploded, his eyes flashing in anger. \"I'm thirteen years old! I don't need you calling the school! I don't want you calling the school! Just-just let me alone! I don't need any help!\" \"Mark!\" Jack exclaimed, shocked beyond words. \"What's gotten into you? Don't you realise I'm on your side? I'm trying to help you!\" \"You can help by leaving me alone !\" Mark shot back. \"I'm thirteen now- stop treating me like a kid !\" \"You don't have to fight your battles by yourself, Mark!\" \" I want to !\" Mark shouted, his temper rising fast. Abruptly, he turned and stormed upstairs, leaving an angry and frustrated Jack to stand there in the entrance hallway. This was strange. It was more than that- it was bizarre, and Jack didn't like it one bit. Why was Mark acting like this? He was playing harder at soccer now than he'd ever done in the past ten years. He was on a constant short-fuse, it seemed, and the only one he really seemed to want to talk to was Henry. And what was this fierce insistence on fighting his own battles? Why did that suddenly matter so much to Mark? Jack sighed, walking back to his office and deciding to just wait it out. Maybe this was the onset of Mark's teenage years; Jack had hoped to avoid all the short-tempered, needless arguments and newfound rebellion against authority. He'd been hoping to help Mark navigate through adolescence easily, and to see him come out unscathed. Perhaps, like so many other parents before him, Jack was just going to have to do this the hard way. While Jack attempted to return to some of his end-of-the-day work and wait for Mark to calm down so they could go pick up a pizza or something, his son wandered out into the upstairs hallway, picking up the wireless set that sat on an end table near the upstairs bathroom. Dialing a number he knew well by memory, Mark wandered back into his room, flopped down on his bed, and waited to hear his cousin's sweet, oily voice. Boop…boop… \"Evans residence, Henry speaking,\" the blonde boy stated in his best diplomatic voice. \"Henry,\" Mark breathed, more a sigh of relief than anything. \"Henry, where's everybody else?\" \"Huh?\" Henry said, puzzled- and beginning to sense something wrong. There was just something off about Mark's voice. He didn't sound all that happy, and he normally did when they talked, if only because he was talking to Henry. \"Mom and Dad took Connie out to get some new clothes and stuff for school. Why, what's going on?\" \"Henry,\" Mark began again, running a hand through his hair and feeling a renewed rush of anger when he saw dirt fall out of it. Turning his attention back to his cousin, Mark said without preamble, \"I got my ass kicked today.\" There was a pause; for perhaps a second or two, Henry said nothing at all. Then Mark heard a clunk as the phone dropped, and a loud crashing sound. Like Henry had kicked over a chair in his room or something. And with that noise came a furious scream, the sound of a boy who wanted very much to retaliate against his brother's enemies but was powerless to do anything about it. \"SON OF A BITCH !\" Henry screamed, with such force Mark feared for his cousin's vocal cords. After a few more moments- and another kicked-over chair- Henry picked up the phone again, sighing as he tried to control his elevated breathing. \"Mark,\" Henry said with effort, \"You still there?\" \"Yeah,\" Mark said, startled and touched at the same time by his cousin's fury on his behalf. \"All right,\" Henry said, his voice steadying as he got an idea. \"Listen.\"[Chapter 10] Chapter X- Hitting Back For that whole weekend, Mark took his time. He slept in on Saturday, getting up around ten in the morning instead of his usual seven or eight. He did his usual range of exercises that morning, and would do them again at night. Then came his karate practice that afternoon; Mark had a special plan for this weekend as far as that went. While there at the dojo, Mark threw himself into the lessons with a passion, always being the first to volunteer whenever sensei Mr. Jennings needed someone for a demonstration. During sparring matches, Mark had more fight in him than any other boy in the class; more than once he had to be reminded these were only sparring matches, and that full-contact moves were not allowed. They weren't aiming to hurt or kill anyone here, and with some reproach sensei Mr. Jennings had to remind Mark of that. \"You're just sparring, Mark,\" Jennings told him during a break, after Mark had won yet another match that day. \"Just try to remember that.\" But the auburn-haired Evans boy just smirked a little, shrugging in his white training uniform. \"Thinking like that,\" Mark said, \"is exactly why Mike lost.\" It was a difficult point to counter- especially since Mark and Mr. Jennings both knew that most if not all real-world uses of the hand-to-hand skills dojos like Mr. Jennings' taught were in circumstances where the danger was real and the opponents held little back. But Mark Evans sought victory single-mindedly, whether he was training on some move individually or practicing in a match with one of the other boys. He fought to win, plain and simple, and had no sense of 'play', no matter how you tried to explain it. The other boys were rather mixed in their opinions of Mark Evans. Some respected him, a few even admired him. Just about all of the boys at Mark's age and below, to a boy, were afraid of Mark. He was aware of their fear and admiration, and didn't seem to mind either. The boys in his class were starting to figure out, though, that whenever they partnered up against Mark Evans, they were almost always fated to lose. Some lasted longer than others, but pretty much every boy who fought Mark on the mat ended up hitting it a few minutes- or moments- later. When Jack Evans arrived to pick up his son at three in the afternoon that Saturday, February 11, Mark greeted him cheerfully as always. Jack was grateful to see this form of Mark back, the cheerful, well-mannered boy rather than the grumbling, surly teenager. A few appearances of that side of Mark had been made already, and Jack wasn't eager to see any more. Today, though, Mark had an interesting request: he wanted some weights. Nothing major- at least, not yet- but ankle and wrist weights, and a pair of basic ten-pound dumbbells. \"Mark?\" Jack asked, kind of startled at the request. He'd seen indications of this now and again in the time since last December, but it was still surprising. Mark was such an enthusiast about physical fitness all of a sudden; previously, a liking for soccer had been about as far as he'd gone in that direction. Of course, Mark was thirteen now, and went to school with boys a year older- by 7th or 8th grade, nearly all boys began changing their behavior and thinking as puberty began to make its impact. Being a teenager would mean wanting to run, do pushups, building up that body for the days on the beach yet to come- days when the \"cute\" boys would start to become \"hot\" ones in the eyes of their female classmates. Maybe it made plenty of sense that Mark should want to start building himself up physically; it made Jack want to smile, thinking that his Mark wanted to impress the girls. Of course, there was another angle to it- maybe he really was serious about what he'd said on Friday. Maybe Mark really did want to start taking charge of his life, solving things his own way- and that would include wanting to have the strength to defend himself against guys like Sean Walters, next time that problem came his way. Jack supposed that made sense, too. Mark couldn't rely on the system to do his fighting for him forever, and especially not if he had serious ambitions of being one of the cool boys at his school. The popular boys got things done themselves. They didn't need to go to the principal with their problems- in the attitude of most American teenagers, Jack knew, such methods as that were in the past, the stuff of elementary school. More importantly, in the eyes of the American teenager, nothing was more laughable than a tattle-tale, and no individual was more loathed than the snitch. Lastly, Mr. Jennings happened to come over to speak with Jack, remarking again about how well Mark was doing in class. Mark had not only talked with Mr. Jennings about his wish to get some weights to work with at home, but after some clever maneuvering had actually come close to convincing Mr. Jennings it was the sensei's idea. \"Mark really could make good use of a basic set, Mr. Evans,\" Jennings said as the two men talked, watching while Mark talked amiably with Jake Schwarz as he and a group of older boys arrived for the next class. The two were clearly retelling the story of their team's victory on the soccer field Friday; Jack found Mark's indignance over the foul he'd been given both amusing and unsettling. He was good-natured about it, having that frustration all athletes did with decisions referees made that they didn't like. But at the same time, Mark had hurt that other kid- and didn't seem to remember that at all. \"Mr. Evans?\" the karate instructor said, looking at him curiously. \"Oh, sorry,\" Jack said. He hadn't realised he'd been spacing out a bit there. Finally, he considered both Mark's request for the basic set of weights, Mr. Jennings' opinion in favour of the idea, and Jack's own thoughts about why Mark was asking. Everything seemed to point towards Mark getting the weights. \"I'll see what Wally World has next time I'm by,\" Jack said with a slight smile, referencing that nickname Wal-Mart had acquired somewhere over the years. The rest of Saturday passed by easily enough. Jack a delighted Mark by Wal-Mart to get his first set of weights, and Mark promptly spent the next hour after dinner that evening lifting the two ten-pounders, stripped to the waist and pausing now and then to admire his slowly- but steadily- growing biceps. Jack passed by once in the upstairs hallway and noticed this, and couldn't help but be amused- and in a way, proud. Mark was growing up, all right. By Sunday, the worst of Mark's bruises were starting to recede, and he seemed to have already started to leave whatever had happened on Friday behind him. When Jack carefully tried to ask what Mark planned to do- especially since Sean could always just come back and do it again- Mark had just shrugged a little, saying \"I don't think he'll do it again\". He mentioned that Sean had also been bothering Alan Parks and more than a few other boys lately; he'd move around, pick on somebody else. And Mark promised he'd talk to the principal's office if he had to- but only if he had to. Truth was, though, Mark just said that to keep his dad calm. Neither of them had officially acknowledged that Sean Walters had fought Mark and won, but both of them had a good sense the other knew it. Sunday night, though, was what Mark was really waiting for. He'd talked things over with Henry and knew just what he was going to do. It was a good plan; simple, easy to remember, and with one clear purpose in mind. Tonight, after his father went to bed… Mark was going to get out of the house. He was going to make his way out of his neighborhood, about a mile up Falconbridge Road, the two-lane street that connected most of the neighborhoods in Mark's area. Mark would then make his way to 4677 Kingsmere Road, a house that conveniently stood parallel to Falconbridge itself. 4677 Kingsmere had a basic picket fence backed by wire- just enough to mark the boundaries and keep the household cocker spaniel inside. The plan was simple. Mark was going to kill that fucking dog. He heard Sean was rather fond of it, and one thing Henry made sure to emphasize was that if you wanted to get to somebody, you had to hit them where they lived. Mark's instinct- something he had mentioned to Henry in their conversation Friday- was, if he lost a fight with his fists, to come back with a knife. If he lost the fight with a knife, he'd come back with an aluminum bat. \"And if I lose the fight with the bat,\" Mark said in a heated voice, \"The guy I'm fighting had better kill me. I'd better be fuckin' dead. Because if I'm not, I'll come back with a gun.\" \"I'd cry at your funeral, Mark,\" Henry had said with a mix of humor and reproach in his voice. \"Don't get me thinking about that.\" He sounded like he was kidding, but beneath it Mark could hear a twinge of sadness; like Henry couldn't bear to hear Mark's death even joked about. \"Sorry, man,\" Mark had said, trying to keep a smile in his voice- but feeling real regret over having joked over so serious a matter. \"And let me tell you something,\" Henry said, his voice a deadly calm to make even a howling Maine winter wind go still. \"Nobody's ever gonna hurt you, Mark.\" \"Why?\" Mark remembered saying, although he already had a good idea of the answer. Henry didn't talk like that much… but when he did, when that tone came into his speech, Henry never joked. He meant what he said. \"Because if they do,\" Henry had almost whispered, \"I'm gonna find 'em. Wherever they go, wherever they are, I'll find them… and I'll fucking kill them. I'll do it if it takes me twenty years.\" Mark had shivered in a way that had nothing to do with the weather outside, or the perfectly even temperature of his room. Suddenly he had a vision of his sudden death, perhaps at the hands of either Sean Walters or somebody like him- the result of a fight, maybe, one that went too far… And in that same moment, standing in the dark of his room as the sun went down, Mark saw Henry Evans, that handsome blonde kid with the icy-cold blue eyes just vanishing. Literally disappearing, gone from all knowledge and ability of any man to locate. But everywhere and nowhere in the world simultaneously- everywhere shadows and dark places existed- Henry Evans would exist. For a week or two months or thirty-five years, he would hunt the dark places of the world, the places where few dared tread… he would pursue Mark's killer with a fury even Hell's demons couldn't overcome. And in the end, no matter how far he had to go or how much trouble it took, Henry would avenge his brother. There was absolutely no doubt. \"I know all that,\" Mark said quietly, controlling his voice against the emotion he felt. \"Yeah,\" Henry said, and the two of them laughed nervously as the powerful emotion of the moment passed. So after that, the topic of conversation had shifted to The Plan. Again, it was a simple and efficient one. Hit Sean Walters where he lived- kill his fucking dog. Henry said he understood Mark's hot-tempered desire to hit right back the fastest and most pleasurable way. He understood it- but sometimes discretion really was the better side of courage. Henry pointed out that the ultimate goal in these situations was to make a point. Bullies were sadists, and Henry said the only way to get one to stop was to hit back so hard, he'd never want to come near you again. Beating him up already had been tried, and killing him outright would be difficult given that Mark would be a prime suspect. Even if Mark got off, being questioned about the murder of one of his biggest enemies at school would do a lot to shake his otherwise stellar reputation. And, as Henry was careful to remind his cousin, not only Mark but both of them very much needed a good reputation. It was more than worth its weight in gold. But the point definitely had to be made. This Sean Walters, Henry said, needed to get hit so hard he'd never, ever come Mark's way again. Having agreed on what was to be done, on that Friday night Mark and Henry had then turned to discussing how. Again, the matter was simple. Mark knew enough about the area he lived in- Phoenix Park was a nice, perfectly average suburb just outside of Phoenix itself, and Mark had lived there for years- to know where more than a couple of his classmates lived. He'd known where Sean's house was for some time, and now and then passed by- on foot or in his dad's Jeep- wishing he could do something with that knowledge. Now he had the chance. Mark had to admit, the thought was exciting. He'd never done anything like this before… but he was looking forward to it. Mark stayed up well past his usual bedtime of 9:30pm; it was part of the plan, as Henry suggested he wait until at least 10. Excited like he hadn't been in years, Mark could feel adrenaline coursing through his system as he lay awake in his bed. He couldn't have gone to sleep if he wanted to. Finally, at 9:40, Mark got out of bed and crept over to his closet. Sliding one of its doors open, he began sorting through the set of still-folded winter clothes Henry had gotten him. They were all name-brand sweaters, pants and jackets- more expensive than anything Mark had owned before. Mark had of course taken all of the warmer-weather clothes from the pile and arranged them neatly in his dresser; he definitely at least looked more like he was part of the 'in' crowd these days. But the cold weather clothes he had stored in the closet, rightly thinking he'd only need the lighter ones for quite a while to come. Henry, however, had suggested Mark take another look at the layered stack of winter clothes. There was something special in there, Henry said. After they ended the phone call and hung up, Mark had spent perhaps ten minutes Friday night looking through the winter clothes in his closet. It took a little searching, a little patience, but Mark found what he was looking for. A black sweater, a thin black shirt, a pair of black sweat-pants, and a ski mask. Mark had smiled when he'd found them on Friday, and as he carefully took the clothes out of the closet tonight, he smiled again. It was just like Henry, to slip something like this in with a whole bunch of ordinary stuff. To make sure Mark would get something he would before long not only want, but need. When he'd come back from Maine, Mark had not quite understood his new views, his new lifestyle, enough to know he'd end up wanting to do murder at night. But Henry had. He'd sensed Mark had people who bothered him at home in Arizona, and that his patience with those morons wouldn't last much longer. Mark had already thanked Henry, who had of course been smug and pleased at the same time. But even so, Mark resolved to thank him again. He was coming to like Henry more and more these days. He didn't like the word \"cousin\", because that did not seem to any longer reflect the relationship the two boys had. \"Brother\" seemed far more appropriate. Mark prepared to leave the house; he knew getting in and out would not be a great challenge. One side of his room had a window that faced the backyard; an extension to the dining room meant a section of roof jutted out just under his window, with a dogwood tree conveniently nearby after that. It would be a simple matter to slip out of his window onto the roof and close the window again, then creep across the roof and climb down the tree. The reverse would be no harder; Mark could hardly have wished for a better setup for an entry and exit. The auburn-haired boy stripped bare and folded his ordinary jeans and dark green t-shirt with obsessive neatness, placing them under his bed and out of sight. Then he looked over the black boxer-briefs, black ski mask, thin black shirt and black sweats he'd laid out for the mission. Mark grinned in the dark of his room, lit only by the eerie light of the moon. This was gonna be awesome. As Mark held up the black shirt and prepared to put it on, he glanced down to see the moonlight playing over his pale body. Briefly distracted, Mark looked over his arms, shoulders, chest and legs- he smiled, pleased. He looked pretty buff. He looked good. All that exercise- the weights had promptly been added starting Saturday night- was really starting to pay off. Briefly, Mark took out the switchblade his cousin gave him, striking a martial pose in his room. He flicked the blade open once, grinning at the six inches of moon-drenched steel. It took only a minute or two for Mark to dress. By 10:15 he had left the house, slipped out the backyard and was down the neighborhood's road, keeping low and always to the shadows. Mark's neighborhood was set on a slight incline, with one road entering, circling the length of the neighborhood uphill, and coming back around as it went down the same incline again. Few cars traveled this road at night, and even Falconbridge was only a secondary road. There would be little traffic to hide from, and the moon was only half-full, with clouds obscuring it from time to time. There were plenty of shadows to hide in, many trees and bushes; this area had been mostly forest before developers had reached it, so many trees remained still. Mark stayed off the road on his way up Falconbridge, instead staying under the cover of the trees but within sight of it. Now and again he would dart behind a tree and go prone, remaining absolutely still as the white headlights of a car passed by. Mark felt thrilled like he'd never been in his life, but he also felt very scared. He had committed no crime- not yet- but a thirteen-year-old boy out this late, especially in all-black clothes and a ski mask with a six-inch switchblade on him, was not going to be looked on without suspicion. If Mark got caught at all, it would be far better to have it happen while he was still on the way there; if he got caught after the act… he'd be done. There could be blood on the knife, his excitement at the completed act of revenge might show on his face- and the death of Sean's dog would soon be reported and very likely connected to Mark. But Mark didn't get caught. Instead, while it took him close to an hour to get the mile or so up the road he needed to go, he'd made it. Hiding in a large bush- or maybe it was a stubby pine tree- Mark could see his target. That was the Walters house all right, and sure enough, in the dark the auburn-haired boy could spot the doghouse. The weather had been good lately, and winters in Arizona were nothing- absolutely nothing- like the unforgiving, vicious cold of Maine. The cocker spaniel was asleep outside, just where Mark needed it to be. His heart pounding, Mark crept up to the edge of the Walters' backyard, finding the point on the fence where the moon touched the least. Confirming his concealment was best here- and that he was farther into the woods and not too close to the road- Mark slipped up to the wood fence and over it. The boy with the auburn hair made no sound at all- none- as he crept low across the yard. Briefly, he paused near the doghouse, cocking his head slightly as he gazed down at the sleeping dog inside. \"TRIXIE\", the upturned tag on the collar said. Mark smiled coldly under the mask; wasn't that a nice name. The moment had come; Henry had been particularly adamant when he told Mark not to hesitate. \"It's you or him, Mark,\" Henry said. \"Just get it done.\" Yeah, Mark thought, I got that. Come on, come on. I can do this. Mark crouched down, reaching into his right pocket and drawing the blade. He pressed the chrome button on its obsidian-black handle, and six inches of Italian steel jumped into the night with a sharp snick. Looking down, Mark gripped the cocker spaniel under its muzzle, jerking its head up so he had a clean shot at its throat. Understandably, the dog woke up, and briefly yelped in surprise. But only briefly- Mark's terror at being caught- and his fiery hate for Sean and lust for revenge- had reached a fever pitch. Mark placed the blade right where it looked like the throat should be- thankfully, it wasn't so different from people- and slashed. The rush of blood that followed told Mark he'd done it right; the surprised dog's struggles and yelps soon halted, and were never especially loud anyway. Mark moved his hands back and dropped the dog quickly, but even so he feared there might be blood on his clothes- it was impossible to tell in the dark. The dog was still. Briefly, Mark debated adding a final touch to it. Henry said- and he agreed- that the point here was sending a message. But what about a coup de grace, a finishing touch to make sure the point was well and truly made? There were so many options. Mark could leave the dead dog on the Walters' back porch; he could stay here for a few extra minutes and see if the switchblade could cut off its head. But one thing Mark worried about was staying here too long. This was some dangerous shit he was doing. Exciting, even thrilling- but dangerous. It was probably best just to bug out now; the cocker spaniel was dead. Sean Walters would find it, and even he would surely sense it was done as an act of revenge. The best part, though, what really made Mark smile, was that although Sean would likely realise Mark Evans had done this, he'd have a hell of a time trying to prove it. Mark's trip back went just as uneventfully as the first. Well, almost. He was riding on the most extreme adrenaline high he'd ever known in his life; Mark felt like he could see everything hiding in the shadows, hear every car coming long before it was in view. He felt like his senses were elevated well above normal levels, even if only for a short time. He was hyper-vigilant, though, and no doubt very nervous. Mark kept jumping and twitching at unusual sounds, and nearly screamed once when he snapped a twig as he crept behind a few trees. Close to home, though, as he reached the edge of a clearing where the road crossed over a small creek, Mark realised something. He had to pee. No, piss- little kids had to pee. The big boys unzipped their flies and pissed. Whatever you called it, though, Mark needed to go and go bad. How hadn't he noticed this before? Why couldn't his bladder have rebelled while he was still in the house? Cursing this development, Mark crouched low and darted for the creek, grateful for a large cloud obscuring the moonlight as he ran. Turning left, Mark ran along the edge of the creek and ran into the short, perhaps twenty-foot tunnel that let the creek run under the bridge. Pulling the sweats down, Mark urinated into the creek, sighing gratefully and smiling. God, did that feel good. Never had Mark enjoyed a piss quite so much. It wasn't merely how bad he'd needed to go; it had just as much to do with tonight. Mark had killed tonight. He'd deliberately taken the life of another living thing, done it because he wanted to- because he could. And he didn't feel bad- not at all. Mark urinated into the creek, wishing the surface of the water was instead Sean Walters' face. Finally, he tucked himself back in his pants. A brief, irrelevant thought occurred to Mark. He'd heard girls did things for boys- that you could get one to drop your pants for you and give you some \"affection\" down there. That sure sounded exciting. The only thing that could make this night better, Mark decided, was if he had a hot girl with him right now. Oh, well. This was more than good enough. His business done- and his bladder very relieved- Mark left the creek and soon returned to his own neighborhood, avoiding only two cars along the remainder of the way. Before he knew it, he was climbing the dogwood tree, sliding open his bedroom window and slipping inside. Mark pulled off the ski mask and collapsed to the carpeted floor, sweaty, tired, and grinning. He hadn't felt such satisfaction in a long while. He lay there for perhaps twenty minutes before his pulse slowed to anything like normal, then stripped and carefully hid his dark clothes in the closet again. This time, though, he hid them under a set of extra blankets- if those clothes did have blood on them, Mark did not at all want them getting it on any of his nice, name-brand winter clothes. After all, he might be going back to Maine soon. Mark wanted to stay there. Pausing again to admire himself in the moonlight, Mark soon slipped naked beneath the covers. He felt good about what he'd done tonight, and couldn't wait to tell Henry about it. There wasn't anything to feel bad about; he'd done what he had to do. And he had every right to enjoy it. Mark was asleep before long, the sweat on his body drying slowly as he slipped away into dreams.[Chapter 11] Chapter XI- The Dream Mark didn't get a lot of sleep that night. It was difficult to explain why at first- after all, he was asleep not even two minutes after his head set down on the pillow. And he stayed asleep most all of the night, even, so that wasn't it either. What it seemed to be- what Mark guessed it was, once he got up Monday morning- was that the sleep Mark experienced had been much too intensified by that dream. It came to Mark quickly, unexpectedly, and took on such form and force that it was hard to believe it wasn't real. That he hadn't somehow been taken from his bed, moved to this strange place, an open sunny field and a forest encrusted in snow and ice. It was unbelievable, impossible- but that was no reason to believe it hadn't happened, or that it hadn't in some way been real. Mark opened his eyes to easily the most bizarre scene he'd ever witnessed. A warm breeze blew his way from the left, coming from a warm and sunny field- one Mark recognized from his travels in Arizona. The sun shone brightly, and the breeze was temperate and gentle. From the right, though, came a harsh, gusting wind of freezing air- and that Mark remembered too. Beside him, this time to the right, Mark could see a stretch of woods, blanketed in snow and encrusted in ice. It was Maine in the deepest part of winter, and it was indeed a bleak and depressing scene. No warm and sunny fields there- indeed, hardly any sun to be spoken of at all. Whereas only handfuls of white cotton-puff clouds dotted the sky on the left, a thick, oppressive blanket of gray snow clouds covered the sky in every direction on the right, hiding the sun from view and blocking much of its light. Mark noticed as he looked around that he stood on a path. A simple, dirt path, probably worn out of the ground more by the passing of many feet over the years than by any deliberate effort by the city council. Looking behind him, Mark could see a thick forest, neither frozen as the one scene ahead was, and not especially warm or inviting as the one on Mark's left was. The path wound backwards and far into the trees, leading Mark to wonder how he'd ever gotten out of there in the first place. A gust of cold wind blew in from the right and struck Mark; instinctively, he clutched himself and shivered, but soon found it did no real good. With a shock, Mark realised he was no differently dressed in this dream than he had been some unknown time ago when he'd gone to bed. Mark was naked, and his increasingly-buff form did him little good here. Looking down, Mark could see he stood at a fork in the path. One side of it headed left into the golden warmth of the field, white clouds dotting its picturesque blue sky. The other was carved out of several inches of snow, leading uphill past rocks and trees and into a harsh and cold land. There was no room for the weak or unfit in that hard, frozen place- only those who truly understood the dangers there and were equipped to meet them had a chance of survival. Mark twisted and turned, wishing he could take refuge somewhere- or just as importantly, find some clothes. How had he gotten here? Why was he dressed- or undressed- just the same as he'd been when he'd gone to bed? What was this place, anyway? And just as importantly, where was it? Someone was calling him. \"Mark? Mark, can you hear me?\" His pulse quickened, and Mark jumped where he was, looking to his left. There- coming across the field towards him! It was his mother! Mark looked around, trying to get a better look at her. He flushed suddenly and covered himself with both hands; he was naked, wherever this was, and now he was standing here in front of his mother! But Janice Evans didn't seem to notice. She didn't seem to care. Far more important things than that mattered here. Mark had been lost in those woods behind him for some time, and he'd been coming to this point all along- whether he knew it or not. A choice had to be made. Janice, however she had come here, appeared to be gripped with a terrible sense of urgency. She appeared afraid for Mark, even sad. \"You've been lost, Mark,\" Janice said, looking distressed like he'd never seen her. \"You have to find the way again.\" \"Mom!\" Mark shouted, overjoyed. This was his mother! And she looked well! Not weak or wasting away from illness, but lively and strong. She was well again! Mark wanted to leap for joy. He wanted to run to her- he wanted to tell her he was glad he could see her again, wherever this was. He was glad his mother was here. Mark noticed he had one foot on both ways the path's fork took it. He instinctively began to turn away from that cold wasteland on the right- who would want to go that way anyhow, with nothing out there and his mother on the left?- when another voice called to him. This one was also immediately familiar, and came from the snowy, ice-encrusted Maine landscape to the right. \"Hey, Mark!\" Mark turned sharply. A boy dressed in gray wool pants, a black wool cap and a tan camel's hair coat was making his way downhill out of the snow; he reached the path after a few moments and stomped some of the snow from his boots. \"Mark!\" Henry called, his blue eyes locked on his cousin. Mark flushed; he didn't like looking like this in front of his cousin. But Henry's eyes never wavered from Mark's, and the fact that Mark was naked never seemed to cross the blonde boy's mind. Just like Mark, he ignored that completely. It didn't matter. Instead, he remained there on the path, there on that very gently sloping hill. Henry's eyes were fixed on Mark's, and something about his expression conveyed a sense of terrible urgency, of great intent. Henry was powerfully focused on something, and it seemed that something was Mark. \"Come on, Mark!\" Henry called, motioning. \"We need to go.\" \"Henry!\" Mark called. \"Henry, what's going on?\" Henry looked puzzled, uncertain- Mark was startled, for he'd never seen Henry like this. Henry, in fact, looked about as surprised and confused about being here as Mark was. Mark wondered again if- somehow- all of this wasn't real. \"I-I don't know, Mark,\" Henry finally admitted. He motioned toward himself. \"Come on, Mark. We can't stay here, we have to go.\" Mark didn't understand that. What was Henry talking about? Why were Henry and Mark's mother so worried, so gripped with a sense of urgency? Mark, clearly, was at the center of it. \"What's happening?\" Mark asked, feeling more confused than ever. \"You're lost, Mark,\" Janice Evans said again, looking worried and sad. She stood on the dirt path some fifty feet away now, dressed in the jeans, short-sleeved shirt and wide-brimmed straw hat Mark always remembered she liked to wear on sunny days, working in the garden. \"Why-why am I lost, Mom?\" Mark called back. Janice pointed at the foot Mark had in the wintry scene; he shivered as he looked, noticing the cold coming up from that frozen path. He wanted to lift his foot from that place, plant both in the warm field- it was human instinct. Yet he couldn't. Mark couldn't make himself move. \"He did this to you,\" Mark's mother said, and Mark right away sensed she was talking about Henry. \"Mom?\" Mark said, confused and startled. \"Henry's my friend!\" \"No,\" Janice said, shaking her head with absolute certainty. \"He's no friend, Mark. Not all sons are good like you, Mark. Some are bad. Henry's not your friend.\" \"Why?\" Mark asked. \"What did Henry do?\" \"You were meant to follow a path, Mark. You're a good son. He's been leading you away from that path- Henry is lying to you.\" Mark felt deeply troubled, and he felt a need to go to his mother. To ask her what was happening, what had happened- to help him make sense of his life, to be there for him and make things right again. Perhaps Mark did more than just want to take a step towards her. Maybe he did move, because Henry yelled at him then. \"Mark! Don't fucking do this!\" The boy with the auburn hair froze where he was. There was real urgency- even fear- in Henry's voice. Mark turned, planting both feet back on the ground again. He still stood with one foot on the path to the sunny field, one in the path leading into the wintry, frozen hill. His decision hadn't been made yet, but Mark knew he'd have to make it soon. Henry stood on the path in the snow-covered landscape, the wind whipping around him as he looked at his cousin. His eyes were wide and fearful, and he stood closer to Mark than before; clearly Henry had taken some steps toward his cousin, afraid of what might be happening. The blonde wasn't just worried; he looked distraught. Perhaps even literally panicked over what he feared was happening. \"Henry,\" Mark said quickly as he gestured at the field, \"Come with me! It's warmer this way!\" But Henry just shook his head. \"I can't go that way, Mark.\" He looked sad, regretful- but there was no arguing with that statement. He would not- could not- go and join Mark in that Arizona field. \"Why?\" Mark asked, growing more puzzled all the time. \"Not in the cards,\" Henry said, clearly reluctant to talk about it. Suddenly, Henry took another step forward. \"Mark,\" he said, his voice taking on a pleading tone. \"Mark!\" he cried as he stepped closer again. Now it was a cry for help. \"Mark,\" Janice Evans called, \"You're a good boy. A good son. Don't listen to someone who isn't.\" Confused beyond words, Mark hesitated and looked at his mother again, feeling an indescribable sense of sadness and longing. He wanted to go to her, see his mother one more time- yet Henry's pleading reached his ears again. \"Mark,\" Henry cried for a third time, and Mark turned to see Henry looking at him with tears in his eyes. \"I can't go that way, Mark. Don't do this to me! I-I hate being out here. Don't make me stay out here alone!\" \"He's leading you somewhere somewhere, Mark. Somewhere you don't want to go.\" The auburn-haired of the two boys glanced at his mother again. He heard her words, knew she meant them- but suddenly he stared in shock, any words he had been getting ready to speak vanishing in an instant. Janice Evans was standing in a grassy field, and he could see the field behind her. He could see the field through her. His mother was still dead. \"You're like my brother, Mark!\" Henry cried, not even bothering to hide his desperation. \"You are my brother, and I'll never leave you- not for anything! I need you, damn it! I need you!\" \"You're different from who you were, Mark,\" Janice said. \"You're not the boy we all knew. You know what's happening? He's doing it. He's changing you.\" Mark now turned to his mother and asked her the same question he'd asked Henry moments ago. \"Can't you come with me?\" he asked, gesturing at the winter landscape where Henry stood. Janice Evans just shook her head, though. \"No, Mark. Where your cousin is I can't be.\" So it was impossible, then. Neither one of them could go where the other was. Mark's mother and cousin both seemed to be ignoring the other- perhaps they couldn't see the other, or simply had no words to spare. Their focus was completely on Mark- he was all that mattered to either person. \"Did you really want to change, Mark?\" his mother asked, and Mark stared at her in shock. What- what was she talking about? \"I'm stronger now, Mom,\" Mark said with a calm that surprised him. He didn't know what she meant about whether he'd wanted to change or not- that part didn't make any sense. But he did know that once the changes had started to happen, the effect they had was hardly a bad one in Mark's mind. He was faster, stronger, tougher and smarter today than he'd ever been before. Guys were starting to take him seriously at school, and girls were calling him 'cute'. He had so much he'd never had before- and he had gained a very good friend. All that Henry Evans had given him. And he had promised before- was promising now- to always be there. To never leave. Janice Evans just looked at Mark sadly, like she sensed she was slowly beginning to lose the battle but still refused to give up. \"Don't be someone you're not, Mark. Don't let him lie to you.\" Mark didn't understand what his mother meant. He was himself today, as much as ever. And sure, he'd resisted the new way Henry had pointed out to him at first- any two boys with such differing backgrounds and viewpoints would have. But in time, Mark had come around to Henry's way of thinking. He liked who he was today, and was touched by Henry's generosity towards him. Still more touching now was Henry's appearance now. Glancing at him, Mark could see his cousin blinking away tears, his face tinged pink by the cold. Most would have said those tears were caused by the harsh wind stinging Henry's face. Certainly the wind was there, but Mark knew better about Henry's tears- his cousin was more than scared of losing Mark to that field in Arizona. He was terrified. For a time all three fell silent, two of the people present letting the third- Mark- do some thinking himself. Both had said what they could- Mark was clearly taking some time to think, trying to make up his own mind. Mark wanted to see his mother again. He still cared about her, even if she was gone. But Henry was here too- Mark didn't know where either place was, or how such a perfect, ruler-straight line could so cleanly divide these two opposite environments. All of this was impossible, every bit of it. Yet here they were, all three of them. Mark thought about Henry. Not anybody else, just Henry. The blonde was as cold as the winter scene around him- briefly, Mark wondered if the environment his mother and cousin stood in didn't symbolize something about them. Henry was a cold boy, mean and ruthless. Suddenly, Mark was very sure of that. But then he hesitated. How was that true? Henry had never been anything but warm and generous to Mark, seemed to be practically falling over himself at times to show his friend kindness. And however much Mark missed his mother, however much he loved her, he could tell something about the path she stood by already. Janice Evans was gone, and that was a tragedy. But she was gone, and that meant that if Mark chose to take her path, he would walk it alone. His mother would never be with him, except in Mark's dreams. He couldn't do that. Henry had come into Mark's life just as his mother left, the biggest loss and deepest sadness Mark had ever known. Henry had shown up like a gift from Heaven, a warm smile on his face and a hand held out in friendship. He'd kept his word about them being brothers, and had been there for Mark every day ever since they'd met. What more evidence did Mark need? What else could he ask for? Henry said they could be brothers. The blonde was no liar; he'd kept his word to Mark every time so far. Mark had never seen Henry so emotional before; it moved Mark powerfully to see his cousin be so engaged in this contest of wills over him. This issue clearly meant the world to Henry. He needed Mark, and had just said so. And Henry was alive. That, ultimately, was what set Mark towards making his decision. He looked down, working up the will he knew he'd need to put both feet into that frozen, wintry land. Maine in the winter was not for the uncertain or poorly committed- you had to have your mind made up about things if you wanted to have any chance at all. Mark suddenly looked to his right; he could hear footsteps crunching on the frozen ground. Henry was walking towards him, his face written with concentration- as if it was taking him real effort to do this. His eyes kept flicking fearfully towards the sunny field to Mark's left as Henry approached. Henry could see it, then. Could see it, and was for some reason afraid of it- as if going that way would not only be difficult for him, but perhaps even harmful. It was literally impossible for him to even attempt it. Henry was now within arm's length of his cousin. He did not cross the boundary, and still stood some five feet away- but Henry was very close now. He had calmed himself somewhat, perhaps having sensed things were not so bad as they'd at first seemed. Henry held out his right hand, and Mark saw Henry had forgotten his gloves. Or perhaps just left them behind. \"Come with me, Mark,\" Henry said, holding his hand out as close as he dared to reach. Mark could reach out and touch Henry now. But if he did… there was a good chance that would be making his decision. \"Come with me, Mark,\" Henry repeated, a little calmer this time. \"I can take you with me.\" Mark gazed off into the snowy Maine landscape. He and Henry had made their way through all that snow well enough when dressed in so many layers of winter clothing, but Mark had none of that. He'd surely freeze in an hour's time at most if there wasn't shelter near. \"It looks cold out there,\" Mark said, shivering again as he felt the icy chill. \"It is,\" Henry said without hesitation. There was no point lying, not to Mark- and certainly not about that. \"But you won't be alone out there, Mark. I'll be with you.\" Henry smiled a little, and the warmth in that smile made Mark feel better somehow. Like things really weren't so bad after all- and perhaps the decision he needed to make had been made already. Perhaps there wasn't much to worry about. Maybe everything was gonna be all right. Finally, Mark made his choice. There was no point in delaying any longer, and Mark knew in that one instant that he could only make the one choice, take just one of the two paths. Mark missed his mother, and always would. But Henry was alive. Henry was there and had been ever since they'd met. Mark had already lost his mother. He could not- would not- lose Henry. Mark turned to his cousin, meeting the blonde's cool blue eyes and gripping his outstretched hand. He stepped over the border into the winter landscape, briefly turning back for one look at his mother- only to see the other two scenes, the forest that had been behind him and the sunny field both, were gone. They had vanished, and only the cold, snowy hill, rocks and trees remained. The cold wind blasted at Mark, and he shivered as he stepped forward along the frozen dirt path, dark with soil that was saturated with cold, cold water. Mark let go of his cousin's hand and again placed both hands over his groin; he feared for what was down there most of all. If frostbite got him there, that would be worse even than losing an arm. It was cold out here. You could say that a thousand times and still not get it. The cold was so intense, so relentless, it numbed the mind. Standing there, Mark almost felt like lying down and just letting the cold take him. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad. Surely if he pressed on into this wasteland, shivering and freezing slowly all the way, he'd just die tired. Somebody was putting a coat around his shoulders. The coat was very fine, lined with camel's hair and the fur of some other animal- something from a much colder climate. Mark gratefully took the coat, slipped it over his shoulders and put his arms into its sleeves. It fit him perfectly. Mark turned to see who his benefactor was, and was surprised- yet somehow not surprised at all- to see it was Henry. The blonde was standing there in clothes almost identical to what he'd been wearing when Mark had last seen him. Those gray wool pants, which Henry bragged were imported from Germany. Mark had received a pair from Henry's dresser before leaving, he now remembered. He wore the same ruby red sweater, and Mark was briefly surprised to see Henry's black cap was gone- but then saw Henry reach forward, gently pulling it down over Mark's own head. Mark's feet still could feel the bitter cold of the ground, but his head and upper body were much warmer. He buttoned the coat closed, and felt much warmer now. But Henry had to be freezing- that sweater, even when accompanied by good German wool pants, could not be meant for weather like this. \"I'm f-fine,\" Henry grinned with some effort, seeing the look of concern on Mark's face. \"I'll be okay. Come on.\" He started walking forward along the path, into the bleak landscape that lay before them. \"We've g-got a long way to go.\" \"Where are we going?\" Mark asked, walking with Henry as the blonde put an arm around his shoulders. \"I'm not really sure,\" Henry said, looking uncertain again for a moment. \"Well,\" Mark said slowly, \"How do we know when we get there?\" Henry didn't even flinch as the icy wind hit him again. It chilled him to the core, but Henry didn't care. He felt so much better now. So much better. It was more than words could ever say. \"We'll know,\" Henry said, and somehow he was sure of that. And somehow, so was Mark. \"You'll stay with me, right?\" Mark said, suddenly desperate for that reassurance. He'd chosen to take this path, to make the insane choice of walking into this bleak and frozen land. With Henry he might have a chance. Without him there was no chance at all. Henry spoke just one word in reply, and right away Mark knew he was telling the truth. \"Always.\" Mark remembered very little of what happened in the dream the following morning. He overslept, and barely got up in time for school. He was tired and irritable throughout the day- only with Jake and some of the other big-shots on the school teams was he even halfway friendly. When Alan Parks- having heard about Mark's beating at the hands of Sean Walters and those morons Eric and Chad- tried to come over and apologize for being so distant, Mark told him not to bother. \"I think I'll be fine,\" Mark said shortly, and after a few minutes Alan gave up and left, wondering how he'd managed to say the wrong thing, and feeling that he was losing- or maybe had already lost- a very good friend. The auburn-haired boy didn't care. As a matter of fact, he was disgusted. A pitiful, weak and skinny boy like Alan Parks, coming up to him- him! - and saying he felt sorry for him? Sympathy from a worm like that, somebody so far beneath Mark he deserved not even to be under the treads of his shoe, was worse than getting beaten up again. Mark wanted no pity from somebody like that. He nursed his bruises and sores throughout the day, barely even noticing when somebody told him Sean Walters was skipping school again today. Supposedly, he was overwhelmed with grief. Somebody had killed his dog. Sitting with Jake Schwarz and some of his buddies from the basketball, soccer, and football teams, Mark just shrugged and asked the soccer team boys present if they wanted to hang back and have a smoke after practice today. His indifference was obvious, and the other guys let it go at that. It surprised some of them, though, at how easily Mark turned his back on the issue. So a bully's dog was gone. So what? Jake, for one, was impressed- this hard-charging, Camel-smoking, I-don't-give-a-damn Mark Evans was almost too cool to be real. He exchanged all the same banter with the guys as Jake did, and clearly liked being given a chance to sit with Jake and his buddies for a day. The whole thing was really just a test of sorts- Jake had been trying to convince his friends he wasn't crazy by hanging out with Mark Evans after that game Friday. Jake had told his buddies Mark was changed, that he wasn't such a goody-two-shoes dweeb anymore. Hell, he was kind of a badass. Even the athletes at school didn't beat up dudes bigger than them every day. Or lose to three guys in a fight and just shrug it off like it was nothing. So half skeptical, half intrigued, Jake's table and team-mates had allowed it. Fine, they said, let the dork sit with us. We'll see how cool he is. They were fairly impressed so far, and more than a little surprised. This could not be Mark Evans. The one they knew by that name was a dork. This guy was kind of cool. Two thousand miles away in a suburb called Rockbridge, just outside of the city of Portland, Maine, Henry Evans woke up with a terrible headache Monday morning. How and why was a mystery to everyone, especially Henry. But he found he could get out of bed easily that morning, and before long had a little spring in his step. Henry even found himself whistling Sousa's \"Semper Fidelis March\" as he came downstairs for breakfast, not even caring that it if anything made his painful headache worse. Henry somehow felt like that was just fine, like it didn't matter- something much more important had been accomplished. Somehow, Henry was sure of it. I was there when Mark needed me , Henry thought once on Monday the 13th, and found the thought brought him great calm, a sense of real satisfaction. He was tired and drained throughout the day, though, and could remember nothing from the previous night. He had the oddest feeling he'd seen Mark- or had spoken to him somehow. None of it made sense- but Henry knew these thoughts were occurring to him for a reason. Henry went to bed early that night, worn out like he hadn't been in years. The thought, the feeling, that he'd somehow been there at a moment when Mark had needed him occurred to Henry once again on Monday, as he was getting ready to go to sleep. Right after that thought came another, this one a question. Will I be there the next time he needs me ? And right on the heels of that: Always .[Chapter 12] Chapter XII- Moving Along By Tuesday, Mark Evans had gained enough standing with Jake Schwarz and his buddies to sit with them again if he liked. And of course, Mark did- these guys were a whole world away from the dorks he'd sat with before. They were cool, they were confident- and like Mark, they looked at the rules as something that was there to be broken. Jake Schwarz and his guys believed the laws of the adult world to be subject to their teenage whims and interests, rather than the other way around. It was nice to see some boys at this stupid school- a few, at least- would perhaps have been worthy of meeting Henry. Mark tagged along with Jake to the classes they shared now- \"tagged along\" might not have been the best word, though. He was making sure that Jake and his buddies knew that while Mark liked them and wanted to hang out with them more, he didn't need them. Being like that- needy and desperate- only made you more of a loser in the eyes of the people who already saw you that way. But the alternative? That could work very well. Napoleon himself had once said, \"France has more need of I than I of France,\" and yet that had only made France adore him more. Word was getting around that Mark Evans was one of the cool guys now. Not everyone was convinced- not yet- but at lunch on Tuesday, something happened to clear up a lot of doubts. John Hendricks, a lanky but tough and good-looking kid on the football team, came by the table- he usually sat with another table of athletes and some preppy kids- and objected to Mark's being there. Mark stood up and told John to get fucked; the football player stared for a moment, dumbstruck. Then his eyes narrowed in anger and a fight looked like it was going to happen; only Jake standing up and speaking to the both of them stopped it. \"Guys, guys!\" Jake said, keeping his eyes on both of them. \"Come on. What class do we have next period?\" \"PE,\" John Hendricks said, still angry but now also confused. \"Why?\" \"Can't we just play dodgeball? Pummel the losers together?\" Mark abruptly burst out laughing. \"You fuckin' asshole, Jake,\" he said, sitting back down and forgetting about John Hendricks entirely. John stared again, looking down at the chuckling Mark. He looked around at the other guys at the table- his friends, who for some reason had accepted this runt, who was not so worthy of the term anymore- into their midst. \"Since when did the Evans kid grow some balls?\" John said, startled at Mark's casual use of bad language. It wasn't something John had expected to hear out of him. \"Oh, I turned thirteen, John. Hit puberty. You know how it is.\" \"Yeah, man,\" John said, giving up and sitting down. \"Whatever, dude.\" Jake got a gleam in his eye as he looked at Mark again. Picking up a chicken nugget, he asked, \"Mark- whaddya say we play my kind of dodgeball?\" Jake Schwarz's version of dodgeball- because that was the game they were playing in PE today- turned out to really just be the same as normal dodgeball, but with a special focus on hitting other kids' heads. You just aimed for the head, throwing as hard and as fast as you could. The more you disoriented your victims, the better, and bonus points if you made them fall over. PE class had easily been Mark's least favourite class in the last year-and-a-half of junior high school. Right away in sixth grade, Mark learned that Physical Education certainly lived up to its name, but not the way it was supposed to. Only on the rarest of occasions did many boys or girls learn much that was useful in the gym- most often it was a time of day the ordinary boys in particular learned to equate with embarrassment. The athletes just showed off, always picking each other for a team anytime a sport was played and easily beating everyone else in the class. Easily one of the most degrading things in PE was the social aspects of it. The people who were cool in the hallways and classrooms were still cool in their gym uniforms, and the ones who weren't still weren't. Perhaps the most dreaded moment for the weaker boys was when the sport or game of the day was announced, and the coach picked team leaders who then picked everyone else. It was perhaps even worse than embarrassing yourself trying to play the chosen sport, because all the not-so-popular kids could do was sit there and wait until one team or the other grudgingly picked them because all the cool and talented kids had been chosen. For most of his time in junior high, that was what PE class had been like for Mark. He'd managed to avoid most of the worst of the razzing and mockery, in no small part due to his budding athletic talent. He only really took interest in soccer, though, which some of the more \"macho\" American boys mocked as a sissy European sport. These days, though, Mark played soccer the hard way and was tossing the basketball and football around in PE class with some increased interest. The result of this was that PE class was steadily becoming one of his more favourite classes during the day. It was a great time to relax, shoot the shit with the guys, brag about who could lift more weights and show off for the girls in class. The rather homoerotic nature of the locker room time before and after class no longer bothered Mark; instead, he found it kind of fun, chatting with the other athletes and making fun of the skinny boys who tried to slink by unnoticed. Mark was also becoming quite the authority in his class when it came to cigarettes. Most of the boys were just experimenting, trying it out or hoping to impress their buddies by breaking the rules. Mark regarded those boys with calm contempt, only really sharing his cigarettes with the guys who were doing it because they liked it. Mark was good at chatting up the older high school kids and college guys in his neighborhood; his ability to come up with cigarettes whenever he wanted them awed some of the boys at school and impressed plenty of others. So it was hardly surprising that on Tuesday, Mark was chosen to be a part of the \"jock team\" in class. The athletes naturally grouped into one team, effortlessly winning whatever game was being played that day and reminding everyone else why the school was theirs. Athletics were glorified in America, from the Superbowl on down- small surprise, then, that countless junior high and high schools worshipped their athletes, no matter how mean and insensitive they could be. Once he was standing over by Jake's group, the taller 8th grade boy gave Mark a glance. \"What about him?\" he said quietly, pointing at Alan Parks. \"No,\" Mark said. \"We don't need losers like that.\" Jake laughed a little, surprised at the flat, cold voice Mark spoke those words in. \"All right,\" he said, and passed over Alan Parks again and again, easily replacing him with another member of the soccer team. Coach O'Malley blew his whistle, and the first two teams faced each other on the gym floor. Jake quickly began directing his jocks' fire, and Mark quickly picked up on the special type of dodgeball they were playing today. Jake nearly always went and visited Coach O'Malley early in the day, the better to know how he was going to remind the ordinary boys how much better Jake was than them. Mark was soon laughing his ass off, slapping palms with Jake or John each time one of the other team's guys was hit. \"Headshot!\" Mark shouted joyously as he watched this one kid's glasses fly off when the foam ball hit him in the side of the head. He noticed the look of disgust Alan Parks gave him, but didn't even care. So what if Alan Parks didn't like what he was doing? Mark was one of \"the boys\" now, or at least well on his way towards that. \"Yo, Mark!\" John Hendricks called. \"Get down, man!\" Mark turned to look where John's eyes were aimed, barely managing to sidestep the ball Alan hurled at him. The shot was thrown in anger, but plenty well-aimed; Mark's surprise as the ball whizzed past him lasted only a moment. Picking up another ball that had landed nearby, Mark tossed it up and slammed his palm into it, sending the ball rocketing towards Alan Park's face. It hit him hard and he sat down with a grunt. Mark made extra sure that Alan, when he sat up, saw the sneer on the auburn-haired boy's face. Jake saw the whole thing and burst out laughing, high-fiving Mark and carrying on the game until O'Malley called the next two teams in. Sitting off to the side in the bleachers, Mark noticed Coach O'Malley overseeing the game. A beefy, heavyset man, Coach Thomas O'Malley had played football for Florida State and to this day retained an old-fashioned belief about pain and suffering, and the role a little humiliation played in the making of men out of boys. He oversaw the second two teams of boys with his arms crossed and a stern look on his face just the same as before, taking no action as the young teens enthusiastically pummeled each other. \"Does he always do that?\" Mark asked Jake, looking at Coach O'Malley. It amazed him, now that he was thinking about it, that the coach hadn't noticed Mark's take-down of Alan Parks when he was clearly observing the games with such interest. \"Yeah, man,\" Mike Hayworth said, chiming in before Jake could respond. \"O'Malley thinks we're making men out of those dorks.\" \"Fat chance,\" John laughed. \"Yeah,\" Mark chuckled. \"Take a lot more than that to make a jock out of a nerd.\" \"Man,\" Jake snickered, \"When did you get some nuts, Mark?\" Mark, gazing off towards the girls in the class, sitting at the other end of the bleachers, was looking at Megan Baker's cheerleader legs. Thank God for gym shorts . \"Dude,\" Mark said distantly, \"I have such a boner right now.\" \"Wow,\" Mike said. \"No way did we need to hear about that.\" \"Nice,\" Jake laughed. Catching sight of who Mark was looking at, he said, \"Aiming high, huh, dude?\" \"Fuck yeah,\" Mark said, matter-of-factly. \"Impressed yet, John?\" Jake said, looking up at John Hendricks with a smirk. \"Yeah,\" John admitted. \"A bit.\" Actually, he was very impressed. Mark Evans had truly done an about-face since last year. Before long he was gonna be shoving nerds into lockers. It was a funny thing to imagine. After practice, Mark and Jake again hung back after the others and smoked a cigarette in the soccer field locker room. Nobody else was out here, so there was nothing to worry about. All through practice Alan Parks had ignored Mark, while the auburn-haired boy had if anything relished the chance of a confrontation or fight. Word was getting out that the two were most surely not friends anymore. Word was also going around that Sean Walters was again missing from school because of his dog; Alan Parks and Mark Evans were being talked about, as the school grapevine was wondering if one of them hadn't done it. Mark, though- he was one of the cool boys. For many kids that ruled him out, then and there. But Alan Parks- he was quiet, reserved- no one seemed to know what he did with his anger. And after getting picked on by Sean Walters for all this time, he had plenty of reason to be angry. Nobody was saying anything, not yet… but there were always rumors. On Monday evening, Mark had spoken briefly with Henry. The call had been short, as both boys were quite worn out. But Mark had told Henry what he'd done Sunday night, and as tired as he was, Henry had grinned and told Mark \"Congratulations\". Mark could almost see the smile on his cousin's face. \"How did it feel?\" Henry had asked, genuinely curious. \"Do you feel bad about it?\" \"No,\" Mark had replied. \"No. I… it felt good . And I'm not sorry. Not at all !\" \"Great, Mark,\" Henry had said in a quiet voice. \"You're a man now, like me.\" The blonde paused. \"Well, except I'm all handsome and educated. Smart. You're kind of a faggot.\" \"Bite me.\" \"I know you want to.\" Turning serious, though, Henry had warned Mark to be careful. The cops would definitely be called on this one, and Mark would surely be named as a suspect. All Mark needed to do- just as long as no one had seen him do it- would be act like any other kid. Just act dumb, act like he had no idea what was going on. It was very important that Mark be that wide-eyed, ordinary kid who'd never done a thing wrong in his life when the cops came to call. If he laughed, for example, when the officer told him that someone had killed Sean Walters' dog, that might prompt him to ask more than just a few questions. Unwilling to give up his beautiful tools, Mark had washed his own laundry and hidden the black clothes away again and tucked away the cleaned-up switchblade. If he gave the police reason to search his room, they might find the black clothes and the blade- and that would be very bad. Sure enough, an officer from Phoenix Park's police department came to visit just after dinner Tuesday night. Jack was surprised when he saw the black-and-white Caprice pull up to a stop outside his driveway; he could count on his fingers the number of times the police had spoken with him in the past ten years. But the officer didn't just want to talk to Jack. He also wanted to talk to Mark. Standing out on the front porch with the officer and his dad, Mark was the picture of childish innocence, hesitant to speak with the policeman and reluctant to say much at all. He had a dazed, wide-eyed look about him, clearly afraid he'd done something wrong. This was much more like the Mark that Jack remembered- the good kid who'd never done a thing wrong in his life. The officer asked the questions he felt he needed to. School officials had stated that Sean Walters was a bully of sorts, though they were reluctant to come out and say it. He was the kind of kid who might make enemies- perhaps even the kind who'd do something like this. \"We weren't enemies,\" Mark said carefully, reluctant to meet the officer's eyes. \"I just hoped he'd leave me alone.\" Jack was asked if Mark had any weapons to speak of- anything that he even could have simply lost, inadvertently providing the real killer with a weapon. Shaking his head, Jack said Mark had never owned a weapon in his life- least of all a blade deadly enough to kill someone's pet. He shook his head again at the idea, disgusted and dismayed- who was sick enough to do something like this? Least of all a kid! Bullies were one thing, but no pet deserved to have the squabbles of people taken out on it. The officer also asked about Mark's whereabouts at the time- late Sunday night- of the event. Answering for his son, Jack said Mark had never left the house. The officer gauged both the actions and reactions of the boy and his father throughout the conversation. They were pretty much always in agreement, but not in any particularly organized kind of way. Their stories just coincided, that was all. And the kid looked startled, scared- that was normal. People, especially kids, had a tendency to feel like they'd done something wrong when the police paid a visit. In fact, that was the sort of thing Patrick Johnson and his comrades in the Phoenix Park Police Department expected. It was when people didn't instinctively become nervous that an officer became nervous. And while a million holes could have been poked in either the father or the son's stories, the true ones tended to look that way. It was the alibis that looked like suits of armour that Johnson worried about. And lastly, simply put, the father looked like he was telling the truth, and he had no reason to lie. Finally, Johnson had asked all he'd come to ask about, and didn't think much of the odds that the station would send him to this address again on this one. He did ask one more question, though. \"Enemies. Has this kid Walters got any? Anybody you can think of, might have a grudge against him?\" Jack couldn't think of anybody, not at first. But then Mark spoke up, in a small voice- one that said he could hardly believe he was really saying this. \"Alan Parks,\" Mark said, appearing not to notice his father's look of astonishment. Mark just shrugged a little. \"Sean… he used to pick on the both of us a lot. I don't think Alan did this but… you might wanna go talk to him.\" Officer Johnson left soon after that, not confirming or denying that the Parks household would also be spoken to- but making a note to that effect one a pad he carried with him. It would do to at least pay the same visit he'd made to the Evans household, given how sure the Walters family had been that Mark Evans had something to do with it. Both father and son breathed a collective sigh of relief as Officer Johnson's Chevrolet pulled away from the curb. For a moment, neither of them said or did anything. Jack opened the front door, though, and Mark followed him inside. \"I'm gonna go upstairs and work out,\" Mark said with remarkable calm given what had just happened. \"Might call Henry later.\" Calling Henry and working out. That was about all Mark seemed to do around the house anymore. Jack felt weary thinking about it sometimes. Mark was a growing boy, getting stronger and more confident every day. His grades were the best they'd ever been, and he was fast recovering from that fight he'd lost last Friday- which he was still unwilling to talk about, or even say who did it. It was like Mark had said- he wanted to solve these things on his own. As Mark turned to head upstairs, though, Jack happened to see him looking back out the glass portion of the front door, watching the red taillights of the black-and-white Caprice vanish into the approaching darkness. For just a moment Mark grinned, and in the odd lighting reaching the stairs from the door he looked very much unlike the scared kid Jack had seen when talking to the police officer. Jack considered saying something, but didn't. He'd been turning away to go back to reading the newspaper, and didn't think Mark had seen him. He soon put the event out of his mind, figuring Mark was just reassuring himself that everything was all right, that he wasn't a suspect- and perhaps looking forward to working out in his room and calling his cousin. But briefly, Jack wondered if his natural instinct to protect his son hadn't somehow been misguided. If by covering Mark, he hadn't somehow done the wrong thing. Sean Walters never returned to his old junior high school. Mark nearly sprayed milk all over the lunch table when he heard that the former bully had been abruptly transferred to a junior high school across town. Word was he'd left a broken boy- defeated now in spirit as well as in form. Nobody could confirm much of anything, and even to Jake and his new- and much more popular- friends, Mark refused to confirm or deny anything at all. But talk gets around, and the word went out to all the kids at Calvin Harris Junior High to ease up on Mark Evans. He wasn't a kid to be crossed.[Chapter 13] Chapter XIII- The Coming of Easter The days left in February passed by quickly. Cheered by Sean's departure from Calvin Harris Junior High School, Mark started hanging around with the new friends he was making on a regular basis. Jake Schwarz was one of those good-looking, popular boys who seemed to know everybody at school worth knowing. The rich kids, the outgoing and athletically talented- he knew them all. Mark liked his new friends much better than his old ones. These were the school's premier students, the best of the best. They could get away with a lot, and the hours of the school day were something they enjoyed, looked forward to- Mark hadn't liked school this much since he'd been in the 5th grade. A week after Sean Walters walked out of Calvin Harris JHS, Mark was invited to tag along with the football team- which Jake Schwarz also played on- and hang around with the guys while they all lifted some weights after school. The soccer team didn't have practice, and Mark wanted to keep up his new manner of always being \"one of the guys\". He was Jake's resident authority on cigarettes now- both on which ones were best, and who to talk to about getting them. Many of the boys just played it safe and paid Mark to take care of it for them- a process he was glad to do for friends and teammates, but would just laugh off if anyone else asked him. Mark's old friends now found him acting like he didn't know them, and perhaps even as if he never had. It was puzzling beyond words, yet it was happening. Neither Alan Parks nor any of the others understood it. The days and weeks passed, February giving way to March. Henry and Mark, gleeful beyond expression at Mark's successful first kill- the culprit had still not been caught, apparently- were soon counting down the days until March 29, 1994- the day before Easter, when Mark and his father would arrive in Portland on a flight from Phoenix. They'd only be staying for that weekend, but it didn't matter. The boys were just thrilled to know that soon, they'd be seeing each other again. On March 1st, Mark was coming back to the locker room with John Hendricks just as Alan Parks was leaving. The two boys entering the room had stayed in the gym a little after class had officially ended, throwing a few hoops and bullshitting about how much of \"it\" they were getting and which girls they liked. Both were lying, and kind of had fun knowing that they both knew it. But soon- soon, they wouldn't be. They were popular boys, and it was easy to get most anything they wanted. Mark and John both looked forward to that. Mark and John wandered back into the locker room chatting amicably, a basketball under each boy's arm. At Mark's suggestion, they decided to take a few extra minutes and head for the showers. Why not, Mark said, when Mr. Jost never notices if we're there half the time anyway? John agreed, and the two boys stripped off the sweat-darkened shirts of their dark green gym uniforms, each making joking complements about the new \"guns\" the other was sporting. They were so busy talking to each other, neither one noticed Alan Parks until he literally walked into them. \"Woah!\" John said, backing up in surprise. \"Watch it, man!\" \"You watch it,\" Alan muttered, trying to make his way past. \"Uh-oh!\" Mark said, a mocking smile on his face. \"What was that?\" Alan just glared at him. \"What the fuck happened to you, man? You're turning into the same fuckin' jerk Sean was.\" John gaped in surprise for just a moment; handsome but far from the sharpest tool in the shed, he tended to assume anyone less popular than him knew not to speak disrespectfully in his presence, to him or to his friends. Apparently this ginger kid didn't. Mark, on the other hand, just glared. Apparently he didn't like hearing this. Handing his gym shirt and basketball to John, Mark promptly grabbed Alan Parks by the scruff of his polo shirt and the handle on top of his backpack. Without a word he threw Alan a few feet back into the room; he rebounded off some lockers and hit the floor with a grunt, shrugging off his backpack and getting to his feet. His jeans had some dust from the floor scuffed on them; Mark wanted to see better than that by the time he was done. He moved forward, and Alan raised his fists. \"Thanks for sending the cops to my place,\" Alan snarled as he shoved Mark in the chest. \"I appreciate it.\" \"Anytime,\" Mark laughed, then shoved one hand against Alan and knocked him back into the lockers again. \"Now gimme your fuckin' lunch money.\" \"Uh, Mark?\" John said hesitantly. \"Are you sure this is a good time? I mean, what if Coach O'Malley hears-\" \"O'Malley ain't gonna hear shit ,\" Mark said without even looking away from his red-haired former friend. \"Even if he's still in his office, he'll figure we're building this dork some character in here.\" John looked like he wanted to argue, but Mark was pissed- the surprisingly fit build he had now was obvious, every growing muscle on his upper body standing out in sharp relief. He was tense and angry, ready to take and throw back anything and everything Alan Parks threw at him. \"It's after lunch, jerkoff,\" Alan replied insolently, and Mark just slammed him against the lockers again. \"I want tomorrow's in advance, then,\" Mark said. \"Let's go, you girl . Come on!\" Alan shoved Mark hard, trying to push him away and get some time to escape. John moved back towards the way he'd come in, though, and the other exit was at the far end of the locker room. Alan snarled angrily and lowered his head, head-butting Mark and knocking him backwards. The two crashed to the tiled floor and began to fight. Contrary to what most might have thought, Alan Parks was not an especially weak boy. He was not really a jock, not by the standards of guys like Jake Schwarz or John Hendricks, but he wasn't in bad shape, either. He managed to give Mark a few good ones to the stomach and chest, even knocking his head against the hard tiled floor once. But then Mark landed a punch so hard Alan's head snapped back. As it struck the floor he saw stars. Mark kicked Alan off him an instant later, and soon Alan was the one pinned on the floor. For the next minute or two after that, Alan struggled furiously while Mark steadily beat the hell out of him. Eventually, handed a good black eye, some bruises on his ribs worse than Sean had ever done, and a split lip, Alan gave up. \"All right,\" he gasped, just as Mark socked him in the stomach again and his lunch began to really start fighting its way back up. \"All right!\" \"Where's my fucking lunch money, loser ?\" Mark snarled, grinning savagely. He knew he'd won, all right. \"In my backpack,\" Alan said with real effort. It hurt to talk. \"In the little pouch, up top.\" Mark got up and grabbed Alan's backpack, unzipping the specified pouch. He carelessly tossed aside an assortment of pens and pencils until he found what he wanted, and turned to Alan, holding it up. \"This?\" he growled, thoroughly disappointed. \"Five fuckin' dollars is all you got, Alan?\" The auburn-haired boy cringed as Mark Evans moved towards him, an angry, ugly look on his face and real contempt in his eyes. He had one fist balled up, ready to pound Alan again. The red-haired boy cringed, unashamed- he could no longer pretend he was anything but afraid. He wished Mark Evans would go away. All he wanted was for this to end. Cowering before his former friend, Alan said, \"No, it's really all I have! It is, I swear!\" After a moment Mark let his fist down, and Alan relaxed a little. Maybe this would be over soon. It wasn't entirely, though, because when Mark stood up he kicked Alan hard in the stomach, causing him to barf out all the air in him just like Sean had. Alan lay on the locker room floor, curled up and gasping for oxygen like a fish. Meanwhile, Mark Evans stood up, went to his locker and stripped as John Hendricks had already done. Taking a towel with him, he wandered off to the showers, laughing with John about how he was gonna buy a slice of pizza for Megan Baker tomorrow, speculating what that might get him on Friday night. John said dream on, but Mark just laughed right back. And so on. After a few moments of listening to the two jerks talking in the shower room, Alan snatched up his backpack and bolted out of the locker room, out of the gym and off to class. He refused to say a word about why he was late, and accepted his teacher's criticism without a word. Anything was better than pissing off Mark Evans. He had learned that much already, along with the sincerest wish he'd ever made- that he and that awful, mean and horrible boy with the auburn hair had never met. On March 10th, Mark kissed Megan Baker at John Hendricks' birthday party. She said she'd always thought he was cute, and running a slender hand down the growing muscles on one of his arms, she asked very sensually how many of her he could press on the bench. Mark, winking, said just as many as you like. Things continued going well for Mark at school, and he was in excellent spirits as he and Henry both anticipated Mark's coming visit towards the end of the month. Mark bragged of his recent romantic accomplishment, proudly informing his cousin of his having reached \"first base\". Henry was green with envy. He didn't even bother making anything up to counter Mark's accomplishment; for some reason, Henry didn't enjoy the idea of lying to Mark like he did with everyone else. Instead, Henry just vowed he'd one-up his cousin soon, to which Mark laughingly replied he wasn't so sure. Jake Schwarz soon was publicly treating Mark Evans as one of his best friends. All of Jake's friends- male and female- knew him now, and Megan Baker was seen regularly flirting with Mark in the hallway as March progressed. More than one girl was envious of the attention she was getting- word was Mark hadn't been past a kiss yet, but with the looks those two were giving each other something more couldn't be long in coming. Megan Baker was an attractive girl, one truly blessed by the figure she was gaining with the onset of the teenage years. She was actually an 8th grader, just like Jake- but he'd already lost interest in her, and Mark was just too cute to pass up. Megan, talking with her friends one afternoon at her house, laughed as they talked about how Mark might take it if she asked him to unbuckle his pants sometime. Boys were always so excitable and jumpy the first time around, with anything. Especially if it involved \"alone time\" with girls. It was probably going to be fun to see. On March 20th, though, a Friday exactly nine days from the big day, disaster struck. The day had gone well- Mark had gotten in trouble for making out with Megan Baker next to his locker that morning, and had made plans to see her at the movies this weekend. The movie theater was dark, Megan pointed out with a coy smile. Maybe if the movie wasn't so good, Mark could get her a hot dog. Mark had flushed beet red when she'd said that, an act Megan and a couple of her friends nearby thought terribly funny. It made Mark excited beyond words, though. You had to interpret these things correctly, but Jake assured Mark he knew what Megan meant. Mark eagerly asked for details, but Jake just smirked. \"Just take her to that movie Saturday. You'll find out what she means soon enough.\" Arriving at home close to four- Mark had stayed after to lift weights and smoke a bit with Jake and the guys- Mark was in the best mood he'd been in for months. Everything was going just like he wanted, and Mark really had no complaints. He'd even killed a squirrel recently- cut off its head after stunning it, knocking it down from a tree with an expertly-thrown rock. Both parts of the squirrel had been disposed of in a nearby creek, and the switchblade Mark still did not own was cleaned thoroughly and hidden away in his room again. Up in his room just after dinner, where Mark had maintained a courteously bored conversation with his dad, Mark eagerly returned to his weight-lifting. What he did at home now was really just recreational; he liked getting the heart-rate up and watching his strengthening upper body take form. Maybe it was a bit homo-erotic, comparing muscles and bragging in the weight room with the guys- but the hell with it. Mark didn't care. This was a key part of getting girls, being the big dog in high school. You had to be in shape, plain and simple. Mark had been trying his best to keep things civil with his father lately. All he really concerned himself with these days, as far as his dad went, was just keeping him in the dark about things and maintaining the usual appearance of normalcy. Henry was the expert on that- as far as Mark could tell, he'd been doing it all his life. But even after just a few months' practice at realizing it was okay to lie, cheat and steal, Mark had to admit he was getting fairly good at it. The big thing was to stop thinking about it as if you were doing something wrong. If you put yourself in a frame of mind where you believed the lies you told as you told them, remembered that everyone was a damn cheat these days, and told yourself you had every right to take what you wanted from those who couldn't keep it… well, as long as you did all that, you'd be fine. So Mark was more than a little surprised when his father's footsteps, echoing down the hallway, didn't head left from the top of the stairs and disappear into the carpet of the master bedroom. Instead, Mark heard them continue down the hall towards his room. So what? Mark thought after a moment of confusion, and went on lifting the dumbbell in his one arm. He liked working shirtless in his room like this, one arm at a time- it wasn't so much about the actual exercise as it was about just looking at those damn beautiful muscles he was acquiring. Mark liked studying the shape of his arm as the biceps grew when he lifted the weight up, then relax again as he lowered it down. These arms had beaten Sean Walters, killed Sean's dog, and beaten Alan Parks just for the hell of it. Mark was a new boy now. He wasn't weak anymore. He was strong. Jack Evans came into the room, dressed in his usual jeans and plaid t-shirt. That was how he was dressed after work, of course- Jack seemed to have a secret wish to be a lumberjack instead of a computer and electronics expert. That was none of Mark's concern, though. He just went on lifting his weights, increasing his upper body strength one arm at a time. \"Hey, Mark,\" Jack said with a slight smile, obviously a little uneasy. \"Hey, Dad,\" Mark said, puffing a bit as he curled his arm slowly at the elbow, going from hanging straight down to fully curled against his bicep. Jack Evans had to pause for just a moment to take all this in; his thirteen-year-old son was standing there in a pair of black exercise shorts, and he looked very buff for his age. His chest, stomach, arm and shoulder muscles all stood out in remarkable relief- Mark's new friends were definitely a physically-talented bunch. And it wasn't just Mark's upper body that was different, formidable as it was coming to be. Looking around the room for a moment, Jack felt a jarring sense of distortion. Like things should have made sense, seemed to- yet didn't. Not at all. Mark's karate gi and green belt were folded neatly on the cushioned wooden chair at his desk. The polished, hand-carved model of the HMS Vanguard was sitting prominently atop his dresser, its many missile silos standing ready to open their caps to the sky and in minutes fire warheads that would cause the death of millions. The walls were different, too. Now instead of soccer teams Mark liked or sports cars he favoured, there were posters of a Marine in dress blues, a B-2 Spirit bomber- indeed, if there was one theme the room's decorations had now, it was warfare. Briefly Jack hesitated, unsure of how to proceed. This looked like somebody else's room. Was this really his son? Where had all these new interests, hobbies, fascinations come from? Jack supposed that many parents before him had gone through realizations like this. When boys started thinking of themselves as young men all of a sudden, you had to expect some changes. Sometimes even drastic ones. Jack just never expected this out of Mark, though. He'd never imagined Mark's teenage years would manifest in this way. \"Mark,\" Jack began carefully, \"I wanted to come up here and talk to you a few minutes. That all right with you?\" \"Sure, Dad,\" Mark said, gripping the weight tighter as he slowly raised and lowered his right arm. \"Well,\" Jack said as he stood near the dresser, \"I just feel like we've been growing kind of distant lately. Drifting apart a bit. I didn't want you to get so upset that one day; I understand you're a teenager now. Things have to change- you want to be a young man instead of a kid now. There's nothing wrong with that. I can accept that, even support you in it. You really have done some growing up, Mark, and I can tell you want to start taking charge of your own life. That's great. It is.\" Jack paused, and Mark kept lifting, shifting the single dumbbell from his right to left hand. He nodded, though, to show he was listening. \"The thing is, Mark, I'm still your father. You're still my son. I left you in Maine for two weeks because I had to, and I'm never going to leave you again. Having you is a great help to me, Mark. And as you get older, go into high school and college, I want you to know I'm behind you all the way. Wherever you go, whatever you do, I'll be there to help you. I'm here for you, Mark. And I always will be.\" Mark huffed a bit, raising the weight in his left arm again. He had really been only half-listening, and there was a fine line between not listening and not caring anyway. Mark liked to think he walked that line every day in his life. \"Thanks, Dad,\" Mark said after a few moments. \"I appreciate that. I really do.\" They were the right words, but they seemed a little contrived. A little forced. They sounded only vaguely like the words the old Mark would have said. Jack had always known Mark to be a boy who was very plain about his emotions; if he was moved by something, you could see it and he was quick to tell you so. This Mark, though, was very different. He was distant at times, often difficult to read; more than once lately Jack had wondered if Mark wasn't making his face a mask- one that hid what he was really thinking. Not at all a tactic Mark had ever even shown interest in using in previous years. Then Mark went and just happened to bring up the very thing Jack was going to have to talk about next. Lifting the weight in his left arm and admiring the way his bicep visibly bulged now, Mark wished he could drop to the floor and start doing some pushups, really shake up his routine and start working himself into a sweat. Dad was here right now, though, so it seemed inappropriate. If only Megan could see me right now, Mark thought, and wanted to smile when he realised she probably soon would. She was so totally into him. I'll work up a sweat with her, all right, Mark thought absently. After a moment, though, Mark's mind returned to more important matters- the only one, really, that mattered more than getting to the next base did. Mark said calmly, \"Still going to see Aunt Susan and Uncle Wallace on Easter, right?\" Jack hesitated, and right away Mark paused in his lifting, sensing something was wrong. He made himself continue, but now really was paying attention. Unlike before, there now could be no doubt at all. Mark was very interested in what his father was going to say. \"Mark,\" Jack said carefully, already sensing his son was not gonna like hearing this. \"Something's come up with the company. I've got this deal I'm working on right now, a contract with this firm over in Maryland. It's pretty intensive work right now, and I can't risk taking even a couple days off until I know more about which way this is going. We'll need to stay here for Easter.\" Abruptly, the ten-pound weight hit the floor with a crash. The auburn-haired boy was instantly facing Jack, his eyes blazing furiously. \"What?\" Mark yelled, as if he'd gone deaf. Oh, shit, Jack thought with dread, sensing another argument coming. Why did he have to deal with this, after he- and, to be fair, Mark- had already been through so much? \"We can go to Maine for Christmas,\" Jack said, hoping that would help. But instead, Mark just got angrier. \"Henry and I have been looking forward to this for months, Dad!\" Mark yelled, the veins on his neck standing out like cords. \"Months! What am I supposed to tell him now? We're just putting it off until the end of the year? How do you know- how do you know something won't come up then, too?\" Mark's voice was steadily rising in pitch and volume, and every one of his growing muscles seemed to stand out, tensed to the maximum as he yelled in fury. He was a strong-looking boy now. Jack was still considerably taller and probably stronger, but Mark was not a kid anymore either- Jack did not like seeing his son this angry. Not at all. \"You can tell Henry we'll be there in December, Mark,\" Jack said, keeping his voice level. \" Fuck December!\" Mark screamed, furiously slamming a fist into the side of his dresser; the model submarine teetered on its stand but didn't fall over. \"Mark,\" Jack said, his voice rising, \"I'm not doing this on purpose! You know these things come up sometimes!\" \"I don't care!\" Mark yelled, getting angrier every second. \"I don't fucking care!\" \"Mark!\" Jack exclaimed, shouting now himself. \"I understand if you're disappointed, but don't you ever swear at me again!\" \"I'll do a lot better than that, Dad!\" Mark shouted, hurling one of his weights across the room. It crashed into his bookshelf, causing the whole thing to shake with the force of the impact. For just a moment the two stood there inches from each other, each shocked and angry with the other. Mark was so furious he didn't know what he might do if he let loose; Jack was hardly a weak man in a fight, but even so felt a tremor of fear at the strength of this teenage son of his. Mark was staring at him with a look of not just dislike or anger, but hate- Jack had never seen his son so angry. Never in either of their lives had an argument gone this far. Suddenly Mark lunged forward; Jack took a step back, fearing things were about to go even farther. Instead, Mark yelled in anger and shoved Jack out of the way, bolting out of his room, down the hall, and down the stairs, taking them two at a time. He tripped and fell close to the bottom, banging his elbows and knees painfully, but rolled to his feet and kept going. He could hear his father calling after him, hurrying to the top of the stars, but Mark didn't care. He threw the front door open, slammed the door behind him, and sprinted down the front lawn and into the neighborhood street. He bolted out and away from his father's house, running downhill and vanishing from sight quite rapidly. Sweat gleamed on Mark's bare upper body now; between his workout, his furious argument with his father, and now his headlong sprint down the street and towards the end of the neighborhood, he was finally working up that sweat he'd wished for. Briefly, Mark noticed that while his legs were pumping, his heart pounding and his lungs taking in air just as fast as they could, he was nonetheless running faster than he'd ever done in his life. He was in truly excellent shape, and getting better all the time, just like he'd figured. Here was the proof. In not even a minute Mark had run outside his neighborhood, and there finally slowed his pace. His senses came back to him a little, and Mark realised some of the neighbors may have seen him. Perhaps they'd noticed something unusual about it. Mark didn't usually run topless like this- he loved admiring himself and his growing muscles these days, but showing off the results of his hard work was not something he usually included on runs. After a few moments, Mark shrugged, setting his pace at a steady jog. It was fairly warm out, and Mark was known to many now as a boy fond of physical exercise. Aside from his father, who would no doubt be trying to find him even now, most anyone else would just assume Mark was a boy out on an evening run. That's just what he wanted them to think. Mark ran. He jogged, really, but periodically increased his pace, even sprinting at certain points. Just to shake things up. Normally he would have taken some real pleasure in this, enjoyed the good exercise and what great shape he was in these days. But today was different. Mark's explosive fury remained with him still, and he periodically growled and swore violently, bitterly disappointed. He wasn't going to see Henry this month. Or the next month. Or all summer. He'd have to wait until the end of the year- and Mark had promised Henry he'd be there for Easter. Henry sounded a little lonely these days. He was trying to hide it, of course, and in fact was doing so good a job anyone besides Mark probably wouldn't have even noticed. But Mark was different- he probably understood Henry better than anyone else alive. Henry was trying to be strong for his cousin- his brother- but was a hurting kid nonetheless. As much as he tried to hide it, he had no real friends besides Mark- you could take one look at Henry and know that for a fact. And Henry clearly didn't know how to be \"one of the boys\" like Mark was doing so well these days. Mark resolved even as he ran that he would change that- teach Henry not only how much being \"cool\" mattered, but how to do it. None of that changed the current situation, though; Henry was alone, and Mark could do nothing to help him. Mark didn't even want to imagine what this would do for Henry, having to wait so many more months all of a sudden, when just days ago he'd been sure Mark would be in Maine in a matter of days. It would be a bitter disappointment for Henry- Mark knew it was for him. But Mark didn't even consider not telling Henry about it. Not for even one moment. Henry was his c-brother, and brothers told each other the truth. So Mark jogged clean up Falconbridge, taking in an admiring glance or two along the way. Some older folks working on their garden nodded in approval- here was a handsome boy if they'd ever seen one, working hard to keep himself in shape. After all, he was clearly already there. And Mark winked at a pretty high school girl out on a run as they passed; the sophomore was a little surprised, but took in the auburn-haired boy's cute looks and firm, strong form and gave him a second glance. Who was that? Did she go to school with him? All of this was just surface appearances, though. Mark knew now what his focus was, and beneath his outward calmness worked towards it with a single-minded sense of purpose. He eventually exited the area of neighborhoods he lived in entirely, turning left to head up a major road with two lanes going either way. After some time heading along this road, Mark saw the brightly-lit parking lot and glowing sign of a 7-11. They would have payphones there. Glad at least for the chance to speak to Henry- nothing mattered more right now than informing him of the news- Mark jogged up off the side of the road and into the 7-11's parking lot. It was after dark now, and those people present were a little confused at so young a boy out so late like this. Mark didn't care. He wanted to piss on their cars, just to show how much he didn't care. Mark really didn't give a shit. Finally dropping his pace to a walk, Mark sighed, panting a little- he'd finally worn himself out. He didn't sit down to rest, though, but instead patted his mesh pockets, praying that his wallet- which Mark kept with him at all times- hadn't been lost during the trip. He sighed in relief after a moment, finding its reassuring shape in his left pocket. Mark took the red-brown bifold wallet out of his pocket and searched it for change; he closed his eyes in relief when he found he had just enough quarters for the call he was gonna have to make. Dropping the coins into the slot of the first payphone he found, Mark stood there off to the side of the 7-11 parking lot, praying for somebody at Henry's house to pick up. \"Hello?\" Henry ! \"Uh, Henry?\" Mark said, still trying to take back his breath a bit. Damn cigarettes. Would he give them up, though? Never. \"Mark!\" Henry said, sounding pleased. \"How's it going?\" There was no other way to do it. Mark owed Henry the truth. \"I'm not coming over for Easter,\" Mark said in a dead voice, damning his father for this with every word. Henry's tone changed abruptly. He was confused- shocked. \"What?\" he said sharply. \"Wh-why?\" \"Dad has this business deal going on,\" Mark said, hating himself for the pain he was no doubt already causing Henry. \"He needs to stay here.\" For perhaps a full minute- it seemed like a lot longer- Mark just heard silence on the line. Nothing- just a vague hum of background noise. Then Henry spoke, his voice calm and eerily detached. \"I'm gonna kill myself.\" Mark felt like something heavy had just been dropped on his head; he teetered as he held the corded phone, feeling as if reality itself was swaying before him. Oh, God, please no . For not even one second did Mark believe Henry was kidding. He knew the blonde too well for that. This was Henry Evans after all. Henry, who thought playing on the train tracks to be a great idea of fun for the weekend. Fear and Henry were not well acquainted, not by any stretch. Mark knew very few things scared his cousin. Henry liked to see death too much for it to hold any real horror for him. Mark held a suspicion that Henry often had toyed with death in the past, merely so the thrill of that extreme danger would bring some kind of excitement into his life. If he did anything now, though… Mark didn't think Henry would be backing off this time. Normally he always would- it was just a game. This next time Henry went to stand near the edge of the cliff near his family's home, or picked up rail spikes by the tracks and a big, heavy diesel came along, the blonde might not come back. No ! Mark thought furiously. If I was there, he'd be fine! I could save him! If he stood to close to that cliff, I'd pull him back if he started leaning forward. If he wouldn't get out of the way when that huge diesel locomotive came onward, threatening to run him down, I'd tackle him. I'd save his life. But then, Mark realised, if he was there, Henry would never be doing this thing in the first place. Suddenly, Mark noticed Henry was talking; some vague, disjointed question about who would cry at his funeral. If anyone did. Abruptly, tears began forcing their way into his eyes, and Mark barked out a desperate \"No!\" that was halfway a sob, attracting some strange glances from a guy coming out into the parking lot. Whatever he'd been saying, Henry stopped just as suddenly as he'd started. \"Huh?\" he said, sounding almost comically surprised; like he'd broken out of a trance. \"No!\" Mark cried again, wanting to yell that again and again until Henry had heard it enough. Until Henry was safe. \"You said we were brothers, Henry,\" Mark said, struggling to keep from breaking down entirely. \"You said we were brothers ! That we'd never be done, that we'd look out for each other!\" He sighed, sobbing a little and sniffling. \"Please!\" he said, pleading now. \"We'll see each other before Christmas, I promise ! If-if I gotta fucking walk to Maine, I'll do it! I swear I will! I don't care what I gotta do, Henry, just please - don't say what you said!\" \"I'm all by myself up here, Mark,\" Henry said in that flat, detached voice. \"I'm lost.\" Mark understood just from those words the extent of what his co-brother was going through. Henry had never had any use for either of his siblings- he'd been unfortunate on that front, not given a true brother who he could trust. Instead all he got was Connie and Richard, annoying brats who stole his parents' love and attention. Henry was strong and brave, though, and had lived life well on his own for twelve whole years. Then Mark showed up. That changed the game- changed everything. Now Henry had a friend, a pal- a brother. Someone he could talk to, confide in, have fun with. Someone who made life infinitely better than it had ever been before. Henry had gained something he hadn't even known he was missing- and then after just two short weeks lost it again. He had probably been trying to keep up hope this whole time, hold his morale up and soldier on, if only for his brother Mark. But even the strong had limits- even Henry could only endure so much. Henry's will had broken when he heard Mark was not coming this month like he'd been wishing for, hoping for. To have it taken away so suddenly, just at the last week before- it was too much. Henry was done. His endurance had reached its end; he'd just had enough. But Mark couldn't give up. Every inch of him was pained beyond words at the thought of losing Henry. He had absolutely no doubt now, standing there in his shoes and exercise shorts outside a 7-11, that if Henry died suddenly, Mark would also. One boy's death would be followed shortly by the other. Mark simply could not bear to have that happen. \"Henry,\" he pleaded, \"I'll walk to Maine. You hear me?\" He started crying, not even ashamed of himself for it like he otherwise would have been. \"I'll walk until my feet bleed . Then I'll keep walking, until I'm there .\" Mark paused, taking in a breath and composing himself a little. \"You believe me?\" There was a silence, and briefly Mark felt a surge of panic- he feared he was now talking to a dead line, already too late to stop his cousin's suicide. But after a few moments, Henry almost whispered back, \"I believe you, Mark.\" \"Then promise me you'll be okay,\" Mark pleaded. \"Just - stay there , okay? I promise I'll see you before Christmas. We'll figure something out.\" Henry sighed and was silent for a time. He no longer had that eerie, frightening calm about him- that cold, detached manner he knew how to do so well. Now Henry just sounded tired when he spoke, and odd as it might have seemed, that made Mark feel a whole world better. \"I promise, Mark,\" he said. \"I'll be okay. Let's-let's figure something out, all right?\" \"We will,\" Mark said with forced firmness. He had no plan at all- not yet- but he refused to let Henry know that. His cousin had been through enough lately. He needed something to reassure him, give him hope- Mark was even willing to lie if it meant giving Henry that something. \"I'll be here,\" Henry replied quietly. The two boys talked for only a minute or two longer, both sounding like what they were- emotionally drained, tired beyond words. But when Mark hung up, exhausted as he was, he felt better. Henry had been informed, and while the worst had nearly happened- Henry had nearly gone over the edge over that one and perhaps literally at that- Mark had talked him down from it. Mark had perhaps saved his cousin's life tonight, and he had a feeling that it was going to come to mean a lot to the both of them. Exhausted and too damn tired to even get up and walk home, Mark just sat down on the curb at the 7-11 and waited. He'd seen the county patrol car pulling in across the parking lot a minute or two ago, probably here by coincidence but perhaps here because of a call from his father. On the lookout for a thirteen-year-old boy with auburn hair, blue eyes and nothing on but running shoes and black exercise shorts, perhaps the officers riding in the Caprice had noticed someone matching that description as they arrived at the 7-11, and instead cautiously waited and watched while they also radioed in. Whatever the reason, Mark's thoughts ultimately turned out to be correct. The two sheriff's deputies cautiously approached him soon after he hung up, and upon seeing he wasn't going to run asked if he was Mark Evans. Sure enough, Mark nodded that he was. They were careful about it- Mark was a runaway kid, not some hooligan or criminal- but Mark was cuffed and put in the back of the big Caprice all the same. He took all this with total indifference. He was just too damn tired. None of this crap mattered to him now. As he rode in the back of the county police car, on his way back to his father's house after all, Mark's eyes took on a dark, hateful look. Anger- no, hate- surged into him, and suddenly, for the first time, Mark truly realised that he hated his father. Mom had passed away not suddenly, but gradually, and Dad had done nothing about it. Henry had come into his life and gladly given Mark everything he wanted and needed, and Mark's dad had just taken all that away. When I get home , Mark thought with a dark look in his eyes, I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch . Maybe not tonight, maybe not tomorrow- but soon. And that was all that mattered.[Chapter 14] Chapter XIV- In Search of Answers It was damn cold outside. Arizona might have already been well on its way to being out of the winter, but Maine was a long way from that point. It was the middle of Saturday afternoon, and it couldn't be any more than twenty or thirty degrees outside. When the wind chill kicked in every now and then, the temperature dropped quite close to freezing, and at night it just got colder still. Henry didn't care. He liked the cold. The warm, milder summers that Maine typically had stood in sharp contrast to its cold, brutal winters. Most Americans had little conception of the kind of cold you dealt with here, this far north from the warm climates of Florida and Georgia. Maine was a harsh place in the winter, and Henry had lived here all his life. He rather liked the cold, though, and not just because of the discomfort and pain it caused- which, after all these years, he was more than used to. Henry liked the fact that Maine was a state that demanded much of its people, forcing them to become hardy and strong and able to adapt to the harsh changes brought on by the winter. Maine was not a state for the foolish or weak, and its climate meant that there were no out-of-state retirees flooding in and overrunning the state's original culture, something that was indeed the case with the state at the extreme southern end of the East Coast. Maine was no place for the weak. You had to change, adapt- and learn to overcome. Henry liked that, and liked very much to think that a life of growing up here had helped make him strong, like he was today. But Henry was bored. He was tired, bored and now very upset. He felt sad, lonely, lost- a kind of emotional turmoil he'd never even experienced before. How had this happened? Where had all of it come from? Was this all because he really missed his good friend, his blood brother Mark? There was a good chance that was so. Both boys, when they'd talked yesterday, had agreed to try to come up with a plan of some kind, some way to ensure that they would indeed see each other before December of this year. Henry was normally the one to take care of these things, but so far he had nothing. He'd withdrawn into himself lately, so preoccupied he'd even left Connie alone. And most of the boys at school that he normally picked on- or picked fights with- he was ignoring too. Henry had just been drifting through the days, not really noticing much difference from one to another. Today, though, Henry vowed he would come up with something. Anything. But he had to help Mark- and perhaps help himself. Henry felt so indifferent to whether he lived or died these days- a state of mind that was more heightened for him than usual anyway- that he feared to even toy around with death like he sometimes did. Stand in front of the train and jump away at the last second, stand near the edge of the cliffs- Henry didn't trust himself near those places now. He was afraid of what he might do if he went near there. Henry was often busy wishing time could hurry up and get to his birthday in August so he could be thirteen like Mark was. Henry wanted to be cool like his cousin, kissing girls and hanging out with the guys. He was good-looking- and knew that to be more than just his own opinion- in good shape physically, smart, wealthy, and a talented soccer player. Henry had all the right stuff to be \"one of the guys\", yet so far only Mark had achieved it. He'd been telling Henry all about it in their last few calls, bragging about lifting weights with the eighth graders and sharing cigarettes with the soccer team captain Jake Schwarz. It made Henry turn green with envy. But Henry just didn't know how to do what Mark was doing. Mark gave a shit what those dorks around him thought, that was the difference. Or it at least seemed to be. Mark hung out with these losers around him, made friends with people to whom he was greatly superior. Why? Henry didn't understand it. He hated those idiots he had to call his classmates, and sometimes was fifty-fifty on whether he would rather kill a girl or date her. Mark didn't seem to see the kids around him any different, not the way he talked to Henry- but he seemed to genuinely like hanging out with \"the guys\". Henry knew Mark understood this stuff better than he did, and wanted to ask him about it- but there were far more important matters to consider right now. Like how to help Mark. How to overcome the difficulty that his father's idiotic business deals had thrown into the situation, blocking the reunion the two cousins had been anticipating for months. It was a disappointment that had nearly broken Henry's spirit, and saddened both boys beyond words. Something would have to be done. Henry made his excuses around 2:30pm and commenced a walk across town, into the hills and towards the imposing form of Fleetwood Hall. The tall, aging brick mansion was a mess these days; its once-glorious gardens were now overrun with weeds, the original plants now either dead or messy and unkempt. Vines and other climbers grew all over the outside of the house in the warmer months, and in the winter the grounds were covered in snow and ice. But the house had been built to last, and so it had. The high brick wall that surrounded the entire property had withstood the years intact, and the house itself had withstood well more than thirty years of neglect. This was where Henry was headed today. He typically visited Fleetwood Hall once or twice a month, going there when he needed some space, time to think- or just a chance to explore, wandering without fear in the ghostly old mansion his great-aunt had owned ever since it was built. Preston Whitmore had ordered it to be constructed in her honour, sure enough- but Helen Whitmore had been the one to become the house's chief designer, the one ordering most of its many odd features, additions and changes. She had spent millions on the house, making it far more extravagant than the Winchester House ever was- and Henry sneered at the notion that it was haunted. So what if it was? The Hall was bigger, grander, had many more odd and seemingly pointless features like the Perspective Hallway, the Glass Library, and the Reversal Room- the last of those three being a perfect replica of Preston Whitmore's office of 1947, but upside down. Desks and lamps were bolted to the ceiling, and all were real. Then of course there was the Clock Tower, from which Preston himself had allegedly jumped in the fifties. A shame, some said. A terrible accident. From what Henry could tell, Great Aunt Helen had never given much of a damn. The Hall was a huge place, possessing over a hundred rooms and- depending on where you were- more than half a dozen floors. There was a wine cellar still holding hundreds of bottles of wine- Henry had found it once, close by the kitchen. He'd considered drinking a 1938 bottle of French Chateau Latour, even going so far as to uncork it and sniff the wine inside. Henry didn't know much about wine, but looking at the dates and names of the bottles, the many countries and US states they came from, Henry figured the collection of wine alone had to be worth millions. Henry had lost his nerve, though, that day in the wine cellar. Sometimes he felt like the house wasn't as dead or empty as some supposed. He'd read an article by some psychology professor this past year, suggesting that Fleetwood Hall was a \"dead cell\", a house that was indeed possessed of some spiritual form or life- a house that had indeed taken on a life of its own, but after so many years of standing empty and alone had gone dormant. Perhaps even died. Henry was almost tempted to try contacting this professor, telling her that this theory she had was close to being right- but he'd rejected it almost as soon as he'd thought of it. For one thing, no university professor, uncommonly insightful or not, would care to listen to the words of a twelve-year-old boy. Secondly, Henry loved the old house, honoured always the memory of Great Aunt Helen. He was not about to reveal its secrets to anyone- especially a person who was closer to the truth than most. The blonde felt like he was sometimes not alone in Fleetwood Hall; there were odd drafts of cool air sometimes, unexplainable given the lack of central air and the fact that nothing should have been moving at all. The house was empty, yet Henry sometimes wondered if that were really so. He was a vigilant, alert boy, and sometimes looked up or peered back behind him, having that odd feeling that he was being watched. Never did his feelings to that effect bring him fear; Henry was sure, absolutely sure that the house was somehow alive, and that it bore him no ill will. He just felt strange sometimes, and knew that while his presence was permitted- in part due to his reverence for the Hall and Helen Whitmore, being that Henry himself was a blood relative- he was not entirely free to do whatever he wanted. He could more or less do as he pleased- but Henry had to be respectful. So Henry left the wine cellar alone, though he looked forward to returning one day. He had spent hours searching the house- at least a full day or two altogether, over the years. Henry liked the cool, slightly musty air of the Hall. He loved its cavernous rooms, its absolute contempt for \"what's the cost?\" in every inch of detail. The doorknobs on even the closets looked like they would sell for thousands these days. The library- there were two, the Glass Library on that rounded turret on the third floor, and the Grand Library on the second- contained thousands of books, many of them first editions, signed by the author. Henry had spent hours in the two libraries alone, reading over the collection and coming to have a secret fondness for literature. The Grand Library was different from the Glass Library because it was more traditional- high wooden walls, every inch of it lined with oak or mahogany. Tall glass windows lined the one side, but they were stained glass- like you would expect to find in a church. That way the light of the sun could be allowed in, but never could the outside world intrude or bother you in your studies. Henry felt more at home in the vast not-quite-emptiness of Fleetwood Hall than he did in his own house. He had once found one of the many bedrooms- one of the grand ones, perhaps reserved for Preston or Helen in their day- and napped there for perhaps an hour. He had felt daring, crawling under those obscenely expensive sheets and falling asleep in a bed that had once belonged to the house's former- or current- master. But nothing had happened- nothing bad anyway- and Henry still remembered that nap as the best damn nap he'd ever had. He had felt not just energized, but healed- as if the house had cleaned him up just a little, strengthened him in the time he'd slept. Perhaps it had been a feeling, and that only- but Henry had made some observations since then in his trips to the Hall, noting, for one thing, that his pesky habit of smoking at least a whole pack every month didn't bother his lungs as much as it should have. Henry was closing in on thirteen and already a regular smoker- but he didn't feel at all like he was suffering reduced lung capacity or overall weakened health because of it. All of those evil, nasty side effects he'd always been warned and warned about- Henry was sure his escaping those had something to do with his regular visits, spending hours breathing in that old air, preserved for all these years in Fleetwood Hall. So on Saturday, March 21st, 1994, Henry made his way across town, zipped up in his tan, fur-lined winter jacket, a black wool cap, and black leather gloves specially made for his young hands by a tailor Wallace knew. He was even wearing his gray wool pants. None of that made much difference, though- the cold bit and stung him all the same. Henry reached the wrought-iron gates after perhaps an hour of walking, as usual unobserved as he made his way up the hill. The road that Fleetwood Hall was set on had no real neighbors- those few other estates nearby, for this was a wealthy area on the outside of Rockbridge, were some distance off and quite content to act like the old, possibly-haunted mansion did not exist. Henry slipped under the front gates as a cold gust of wind hit him, walking steadily across the circular front drive, past the massive stone fountain and up to the front doors. Those tall, heavy doors had been locked for decades. Supposedly a caretaker or somebody came by once in a while, but Henry doubted it. What the guy probably did- if he even existed at all- was drive up to the front gates, make sure they were still locked, and drive off. That place gave everybody the willies. Well, everybody except Henry. The doors were set a few feet back from the drive, so brick hung overhead and to either side, stretching forward for some ten feet and shielding Henry from the wind rather nicely. \"Thanks, Great Aunt Helen,\" Henry muttered with a small smile, taking out the pack of cigarettes in his pocket and flipping open his Zippo lighter. He stood there for perhaps five minutes in the shelter of the entrance, inhaling the smoke, holding it in, and breathing it out into the wind. It didn't help much- but it calmed his nerves a little. It made Henry feel a little better, and that counted for something. Finally, Henry ground the cigarette out on the underside of his boot, tucking the butt away near the front door, remembering that he would have to come back for it later. Henry never, ever smoked inside Fleetwood Hall- he wasn't sure if Great Aunt Helen would approve. A massive painting of her hung in the grand entrance hall, and Henry would bow respectfully to it every time he entered before proceeding further. Henry didn't want to displease her by bringing that vice of his into the house. Henry reached out and set a hand on the doorknob. Just like usual, his body suddenly tensed up, thrumming with energy as his eyes stared blankly open. Henry concentrated on one thought- one specific request- letting the house know who he was, and asking respectfully that he be allowed to enter. The house knew his touch well, and after only a few moments the odd connection made by the doorknob was broken. Henry was released from that strange trance, gasping a little as he released his hand. The doorknob always felt hot as he let go at that moment, like it had zapped him with a few volts. Henry reached out again, though, and the doorknob was cold from the outside air. Perfectly normal. He turned it, and the brass knob turned easily enough, swinging one of the two heavy front doors open and letting Henry in. He soon closed it again, grateful to let Fleetwood Hall shield him from the harshness of the world outside. The Corridor- for that was the name of the massive, unbelievably-long hallway that ran the length of the house on the second floor- was for the most part dark, and as always quiet. Having hung up his coat, hat and gloves in a closet near the front door, Henry ascended the dozens of steps of the grand staircase and turned left, heading down the Corridor and for the stairs he knew would take him to the Glass Library. It took many minutes of wandering- Henry never allowed himself to panic or become rushed, as that seemed to invite the hostility or aggression of the house- but he made it sure enough. Henry swung open the door to the Glass Library, and the massive, priceless English chandelier again glowed with light, illuminating the tall, wide dome of milky, marble-like glass nicely. The floor- a massive circle over two hundred feet across if you looked straight down on it- was made of glass also, this time the same kind you found in mirrors. The bookshelves, lining the room's marble-white glass walls, were a dark green- the natural colour of glass. Only a brick housing and dark slate roof on the outside broke the room's impression of being made entirely from glass- and with no windows in this library, you could not tell that from inside the house. Not at all. Walking into the room, Henry was impressed as always, even awed. This room had to be capable of holding a hundred people easily, perhaps more. There was smooth, cool glass everywhere- Henry loved it. This was just the kind of thing you'd expect to find in a palace of ice, but with none of that harsh, awful cold. Instead, it was simply cool- the cold of the winter without its deathly chill. Henry liked it. Curiously walking the room in silence, looking down at his image in the floor or gazing up at the ceiling, Henry thought about his cousin- his brother, his good friend Mark. Not far from this room, just down the hall, going on a year ago Henry had taken care of business quite nicely. He'd led Mark deep into the house- too far for him to ever get out on his own. Especially not if you were a problem- Henry knew he was only able to walk the house like it was an ordinary mansion because it liked him. If it didn't- or perhaps if it was just feeling mischievous, whoever you were- the Hall had a way of changing things up. The architecture you saw yourself rarely ever matched up with the blueprints- Henry found the only way he could ever stay oriented, ever have a chance of finding what he'd come for, was to focus his thoughts on one place or room as he searched for it. To a concentrated, well-organized mind, the house seemed to respond with some measure of respect. Of course, Henry was blood. That made a world of difference. An outsider with a whole team of help, even, would be in serious trouble here. Henry tried to remember what had happened that day. He knew Mark had run out of the room in a panic, and Henry had watched in awe as the mirror floor of the Glass Library became porous for Mark, rippling like water at his steps and starting to let him sink in like it was very thick syrup. Mark had escaped the room- just barely- but Henry had taken off running by then, and had caught up to his cousin around the next corner, as Mark fled down the hall and back towards the stairwell. Henry had overwhelmed his cousin's efforts to fight back, and had throttled him into unconsciousness. It had tired Henry, that effort, as had the process of heaving Mark up and over his shoulders and carrying him back to the Glass Library. From there Henry's memory was vague; he had really just been operating on intuition from them on… or perhaps, taking guiding hints that the house gave him. Henry had put Mark back in the Glass Library; he knew that much. In his past explorations, the blonde had rightly sensed that this room was somehow a particularly strong place for the house. He'd once passed by here and seen a dead body hanging from the chandelier; a group of college boys had once broken in here for a prank or something, perhaps on a dare. That was what the story said. At any rate, they had gotten lost, and only five of the six had ultimately made it out. The sixth was still in here somewhere. That body Henry had seen- it looked like some kid in his twenties, and Henry had nearly screamed when he'd seen it hanging from that chandelier, a rope about his neck. He'd been dead for a while. But Henry had darted out of sight, as if afraid the body would open its eyes and see him, and when he'd dared to look back inside the Glass Library, the rope and the body were gone. So what had happened? Henry had a hard time trying to remember. He frowned in concentration, but couldn't come up with much. He had a vague memory of laying Mark out flat on the floor, knowing that was… was what needed to happen. It would begin the process of changing Mark. Fixing him. Making the stronger boy he wanted to be a reality. Henry took a few more steps that were oddly slower, softer- he looked down and saw the floor actually ripple around his foot a little, patting down softly on its surface. It wasn't turning to quicksand or anything- nothing at all like it had done to Mark- but the change was there, however slight. The blonde boy felt very tired now; truth be told he'd been tired all day. The sleep he'd gotten after staying up so late last night, thinking about the new problem and when he was gonna see Mark next, had not been very complete. Maybe I should lie down , Henry thought distantly. Yes, lie down and rest, a voice seemed to answer . You'll feel better . So Henry did, lying out flat on the shiny, mirror-glass floor of the library. He folded his hands on his taut belly, over that warm red sweater he liked so much. Then Henry made himself close his eyes, calming himself and slowly forcing all worries and anger from his mind. Soon he began to breathe deeply and regularly. What happened next Henry wasn't really sure. He must surely have fallen asleep, because it had to have been the strangest dream he'd ever experienced. He saw himself last December, breathing hard as he carried Mark back into the library and set him down. Henry saw himself standing near Mark, panting as he stared down at his unconscious cousin. Then it happened. Mark disappeared into the floor, slowly sinking beneath the mirror-glass surface. Henry exclaimed in surprise and hurried to the spot, staring down at it. The glass was not so completely reflective now; Henry could see his auburn-haired cousin beneath it, floating slowly along as if he was underwater- much like Connie had done when Henry had put her under the ice at the lake. Dark water ran down there under the glass; it seemed to flow and twist around Mark, but never actually touched him. He floated slowly along, gradually travelling from the center of the room to one side. Henry followed along, staring down in absolute fascination. Never, ever had he seen anything like this. A vague, yet fascinating, incredible thought reached Henry. I want to touch it . No, better yet, stick his head under it. Like you did with a pond or lake if you wanted to yell at the mermaids to stop banging on their conches and go to sleep. You know, if you lived by a lake that had mermaids. Regardless, Henry very much wanted to put his head under that glass and open his eyes. Surely it would be possible. The floor held his weight now, but it felt slightly soft, as if it was not really the glass floor it pretended to be. Henry dropped to his knees, gazing down at his cousin as he moved slowly along under the floor, his eyes closed. Henry slowly lowered his face to the glass. Now seeing this memory through his own eyes at the time, Henry watched in fascination as he swayed oddly on his knees, gazing down at his cousin. His face was somehow raised from the floor again, but he hung over Mark- who for some reason the black liquid had stopped moving along for right now. Henry groaned, croaking oddly- it was the weirdest sound he'd ever heard, completely unlike a frog or toad yet somehow exactly like it. As if an electric shaver had learned to croak like a bullfrog. A strange, gray cloud of vapor emerged from his throat, hanging in front of Henry for a moment before descending down to the floor, towards Mark. Henry's cousin, meanwhile, had opened his throat, and a similarly-sized cloud of glowing amber emerged, rising out of the floor as the gray vapor descended. The two vapors passed without touching. The one descended to Mark, reaching him and turning jet-black as the dark liquid of the floor reached it. The amber vapor, meanwhile, glowing slightly, rose to meet Henry and soon vanished inside his open mouth. He felt a strange warmth, and suddenly felt like he didn't just know Mark- but was him. That feeling passed, though, and Henry abruptly jerked his face up from where it was, hovering low over the floor. He gasped, feeling incredibly tired and drained, and rolled to move away from sitting directly above Mark. Henry breathed, grateful for air- it seemed like during that bizarre few moments he'd forgotten how to take in oxygen properly. Sometime later- he had no idea how long- Mark was on the surface of the floor again. Henry, incredibly tired as it was, had known it would not do to have Mark wake up here. With superhuman effort- causing his arms and shoulders incredible strain- Henry lifted his cousin again, this time carrying him all the way back to the grand entrance room. There he had placed his winter coat around Mark, waiting patiently until he woke up. Henry suddenly opened his eyes- he blinked, sitting up and looking around. This was 1994, not late 1993. What he had just seen- that was the past. That had happened not quite a year ago, when Henry had saved his cousin from being a sissy for the rest of his life. What were those vapors he'd seen- what had been happening? It seemed like something from Mark- something- had come out, and gone into Henry. And vice versa. What did that mean? Were the two more alike now, because of that? Had Henry given something of himself to Mark- and Mark to him? Henry didn't know how the house worked- what it had done, exactly, to set Mark right and fix him. But perhaps… that was how it had been. Henry got up and began pacing the room again, thinking as he walked under the glass chandelier. He remembered what Mark had been like at first- so scared, so nervous and jumping at every shadow. And oh, how righteous he'd been. So pious and moral. But Mark had been a good kid at heart- Henry sensed right away he had the right stuff to be Henry's friend. The tests Henry had put Mark through- smoking a cigarette, shooting the dog, throwing bricks through the windows at the rail yard warehouse and tossing Mr. Highway off the bridge- had at times been quite tedious. Mark's whining and hesitation had come close to making Henry very angry. But Henry had been patient, and gradually Mark had come to like his cousin a little. And trust him. Finally, Henry had concluded that they had to take a trip to the Hall- only there, he was somehow quite sure, would Mark be set on the proper path for good. Only there could things be set right. The house had changed Mark somehow; altered him. In the past, Henry had theorized that Fleetwood Hall had forced out the weakness in Mark, removed the \"goody two-shoes\" part of him like a tumor or something. But maybe things weren't that simple. Maybe even so strange and powerful a place as Fleetwood Hall was not all-powerful, and had limits to what it could do and how it could do it. The house, perhaps, had been unable to force a change in Mark, who was too 'nice' for that. Not outright. Instead, the Hall had worked out a trade. To change Mark's character, it had to do… an exchange . A bit of Mark for Henry, a bit of Henry for Mark. That would make a hell of a strong bond , Henry noted. We really would be brothers after that, if that's what happened. We'd almost be telepathic or something, never truly apart and inseparable when together . Maybe that was what had happened. It certainly made sense, more so than Henry's other theories. Gradually, Henry began to recover from whatever dream-state he'd gone into. He paced the floor, realizing his new theory was probably correct as his thoughts became sharp and clear. Then he stopped suddenly, looking from one place to another on the floor. After a few moments, he was sure of it. He'd woken up more than twelve feet away from where he'd laid down. I just went under the floor . Henry felt excitement humming through him; he wanted to whoop for joy. He'd done it- he'd figured it out! Yet another discovery, one more piece of knowledge that was his. Henry soon headed out of the Glass Library, smiling happily and even whistling a little, calmly heading back for the entrance. Soon, he would begin the trip home. He'd be there just in time for dinner- good timing, as always. As he walked home, Henry hardly even noticed the cold. His mind was on his cousin, thousands of miles away in Arizona. Henry knew now what would have to be done- and he was equally sure, somehow, that Mark had reached the same conclusion. Jack Evans needed to be removed from the equation. Taken out of the picture. Plain and simple- he had to go. But how? It would be small help to Mark if Henry called and simply told him that. Mark would need the how of the question answered. There were so many options, so many ways- and too many were either too obvious as murder rather than an accident, or simply unavailable because Mark's house would likely not have the tools. But fires- they happened all the time. Bad wiring, a problem with the furnace getting out of hand- all kinds of things could happen. As he walked home, Henry briefly got a picture- a sight of Mark's house burning down, of Jack just not making it out. And Mark, barely escaping, struggling out as the sole survivor. The heroic boy who had now survived not just one but two lost parents. Henry broke into a run as he reached Chamberlain Drive. After dinner- just as soon as it was over- he had someone to call.[Chapter 15] Chapter XV- The Fallen Angel Mark lay naked in his bed, staring at the ceiling. The wireless handset lay beside him on the bed- his dad hadn't taken that away, at least. He'd been grounded, all day long, and would be for the weekend. Jack Evans had finally put his foot down. He couldn't call Alice Davenport, thank God- she was in Maine and in no position to come by and bother him. But Jack was talking about what changes would need to be made- things that would have to be done, for Mark's own good. They had a problem on their hands, and Jack wanted Mark's help in trying to fix it. Fat chance. Mark bitterly thought of his planned date with Megan today; he'd called her this afternoon and told her the bad news. She'd been disappointed, sad for him- all Mark told her was that he'd had a fight with his dad, and been grounded for it. That was all she needed to know. I could have gotten my first blowjob during a movie, or shortly afterwards , Mark thought bitterly. Instead I got to stay here . He'd jerked off, of course, shortly after talking to Megan on the phone. But obviously that wasn't at all the same. Mark wanted to go out today, see Megan and maybe do some kissing in the dark of a movie theater. Then maybe he could unbuckle his belt, unzip his fly, and they could do a lot more than just kissing. Megan was a great first girlfriend. Her voice, even, smooth and elegant, was quite a turn-on. She was a good-looking girl, and Mark wanted her the more he thought about it. He didn't care much about dating or any of the rest of that crap. But if it got him somewhere he wanted to go- fine. He'd go see movies and take a girl ice-skating and whatever. Whatever it took, he'd do it. But he was stuck here in this fucking house instead. He wasn't with Megan, or Henry, or Jake- or anybody else he wanted to be with. He was stuck here, and probably with an appointment to see another Alice Davenport. If that hadn't been done already, it would be soon enough. Mark hated therapy. He hated the very idea of it. Those people made so much money off a profession that was 9 times out of 10 bullshit. All they did was confuse you more, if anything- and certainly they didn't do much to help. In any case, Mark could only sneer at the idea of someone being so weak that they needed another person to tell them what to think and how to think it. Weak minds like that were how dictatorships got started, because too many people were too damn weak to make the decisions themselves. As it happened, though, Mark liked the idea of a dictatorship these days. It was a simpler process- streamlined, and efficient. Only the strongest men ruled in a one-party state, with the constant jockeying for power a way of making sure that the strongest of them all was always the one in charge. You got more done that way, with no petty squabbles between political parties and running for re-election getting in the way of things. Mark wanted to be a dictator one day, a strong, iron-handed man whom all would fear and worship. But he wanted to do that with his cousin. He didn't want to rule alone- he wanted Henry there with him. He couldn't bear the thought of living a life without Henry at all anymore. They were just too close for that; it was, perhaps, the only real weakness either of them had. Towards 3:45 Megan called, and Mark let one hand stray below his waist while he talked with her. They flirted, talking about all the fun they'd have next weekend- when Mark would get out and see her, no matter what happened. Mark told her that next time he saw her, he'd give her a kiss- and anything else she wanted. Megan laughed warmly and told him she had some ideas. Eventually, they hung up, Megan wishing Mark luck with getting off being grounded. Mark thanked her, then promptly finished up and cleaned up the slight mess he'd made on his bed. He was new to all this- everything that came with being thirteen and the changes it brought with it- but he was enjoying what he'd experienced so far immensely. Mark was getting a feeling he was gonna love- absolutely love- being male. You got to have all the fun and none of the inconvenient consequences or downsides. Boys didn't have to bleed on the toilet every month, or carry a child for nine months if some \"fun\" on a date or a weekend sleepover had some unintended results. They got to do the fun part, and weren't part of the process for anything else. Boys could lift weights, drive cars, screw girls- do everything they wanted. Girls, in Mark's mind, were really just there to satisfy the wants and needs of the boys. And what was wrong with that? Mark knew that whenever he dated a girl, he'd always treat her well. Generously, even. At least until he got bored, anyway. But how could anyone fault him for that? Going out with one girl for years had to be boring as hell. Mark felt like he'd rather move around, party a little- or a lot. Maybe date two girls at once, keeping one in the dark about the other. You could only do that if they were at two different schools, most likely, and even then it would be a challenge- but Mark liked challenges. Mark worked out in his room for a while, resting here and there- wishing he was 'working out' on Megan instead. His mind constantly focused in on his current situation, on his father- and how much he hated him. Mark knew he was gonna do something this weekend. He was done putting up with this bullshit. He was ready to go- ready to kill the one thing standing between him and his brother, and move on. He wanted to go to high school with Henry and just raise hell all four years. He wanted to party his ass off, and show Henry all the fine points of how to do it. He had a feeling his brother needed a bit of help there. But that was what brothers were for, after all. To look out for and help each other. But he wasn't going to see Henry until December. Not if the current situation was left unaltered. And even then, it was late December- almost the end of the year. Mark felt a surge of anger whenever he thought about it- he felt worse than let down, disappointed- he felt betrayed. For so many months he and Henry had together looked forward to March 30- the day when they would be reunited, for however short a time. For months that had been their hope, the thing that had kept each of them going. But suddenly, all that had gone away. The hope they'd been given vanished. And now Mark and Henry had a whole summer and fall to wait before even the hope of seeing each other again would resurface. Come to think of it, though, Mark wasn't so sure about that either. As he dropped to the floor of his room and did a set of 20 pushups, Mark realised he was not at all willing to believe in the promised visit at Christmastime. Oh, sure, Dad promised that they'd go- but he'd promised for Easter, too. How could Mark expect to know that this wouldn't turn out to be a false hope, too? How was he supposed to know that the trip to Maine for Christmas wouldn't be cancelled just like Easter was? He couldn't. That was the only answer. Mark kept working out, picking up the intensity and working himself into a sweat. He stopped counting the pushups, the jumping jacks, the sit-ups and curls with the dumbbells. He just did them, thinking furiously that something was gonna have to be done- and that he was in no way willing to wait long before he did it. Given how long-lasting the consequences of this weekend's fight were likely to be, Mark realised it might actually be best to act soon. To just hurry up and get things done rather than wait around about it. Mark was just starting to debate what kind of plan he would carry out- how he would go about doing what he needed to do- when the phone rang again. He glanced at his watch- it was 4:30or so. Pausing to pull on his boxer-briefs and a pair of jean shorts, Mark picked up the phone, pleased when he recognized the number. This had to be Henry! \"Hello?\" Mark said, and sure enough it was. \"Mark,\" Henry said calmly, sounding much more like his old self. \"Doing all right?\" \"Grounded,\" Mark said, sitting down on his bed. \"Sorry to hear about that,\" Henry said, with some measure of sympathy. Proceeding quickly to what he'd called about, though, Henry lowered his voice a little. \"I've got a plan, Mark,\" he said. \"So do I,\" Mark said evenly. \"You do?\" Henry was surprised, but pleased. \"What kind of plan?\" \"A good one,\" Mark said. \"Permanent solution is needed to a constant problem.\" Mark could almost see Henry grin on the other end of the line; Mark knew he was smiling as the two fell readily into a coded exchange of words. \"Concur,\" Henry said. \"Would AZ like suggestions?\" \"Would appreciate, ME,\" Mark replied with a smile. \"Persistent problems are like the cockroach,\" Henry said. \"Purge it with flame.\" He grinned a little at the last sentence; he'd always wanted to say that. \"What means is best, ME?\" Mark said, eagerly awaiting the answer. If he was following the conversation accurately, Henry was telling him to burn his own house down. To purge the problem he faced with flame- and make sure, obviously, that only he made it out alive. But this would have to be an accident. There had to be no doubt that Mark was the tragic victim, yet again. If anyone even suspected arson, Mark might not see Henry or anyone else for a very long time. And that was unacceptable. \"Accidents happen,\" Henry said with a shrug, though Mark couldn't see it. \"They happen all the time. Just ask my mom about-\" \"Mark!\" Jack called, heading up the stairs. \"Dinner in half an hour!\" \"All right, Dad!\" Mark called back, doing his best to sound pleasant. \"Thanks!\" \"See you in a bit,\" Jack said, heading back downstairs. \"Tell Henry I said hi.\" He'd considered revoking Mark's phone privileges as well as his ability to go out this weekend, but had ultimately decided against that. Mark was angry, sure, but in some ways he had a right to be. He was bitterly disappointed that he wouldn't get to go to Maine for Easter- Jack understood his son and Henry got along very well these days, but hadn't realised how close they'd gotten to be. Even so, that didn't excuse how angry Mark had gotten- a line had to be drawn on these things, for Mark's own good. \"Accidents happen,\" Henry repeated as Mark held the phone back up to his ear. \"I got it,\" Mark said. \"What kind of accidents?\" \"Well,\" Henry said, \"There's electrical fires- problems with the boiler. All kinds of stuff, Mark. You gotta be careful, though. Real careful.\" Mark understood what Henry meant- it was a twofold warning, telling him firstly not to get caught, and then secondly not to get killed. \"I'll be careful,\" Mark said solemnly. \"I'll see you soon, Henry.\" \"See you soon, Mark,\" Henry answered. He paused, then added again, \"Be careful. Really. Don't screw this up, please.\" \"I won't,\" Mark said. \"I promise.\" \"I'd better give you some details,\" Henry said solemnly. \"You need to know how to get this done.\" For perhaps ten or fifteen minutes, the two boys talked in a vague code, Henry relaying instructions on how to start a fire in the house, how to make it look like an accident- and how to make sure his father didn't make it out when he wasn't supposed to. Mark occasionally asked a question but mostly listened, taking care to write down what he was being told. Henry didn't know the layout of the house but had a decent understanding of electrical systems and typical furnaces used to heat homes; he told Mark everything he could but had to leave some aspects of it to him. The final act itself would have to be carried out by Mark alone. The full impact of what he was getting ready to do began to weigh on Mark. Not in any of the ways most would have expected- Mark felt no real guilt over what was coming. He was only doing what he had to do, after all- no more and no less. But this was an immensely important moment. He was getting ready to kill someone for the first time- not only that, but kill his father. That wasn't an easy thing to do. And if he failed- if he got caught- Mark would go away for a very long time. He'd get put in \"one of those places\", as Henry liked to call them. And if anyone found out Henry's involvement in the plan, Henry would go away too. They'd never see each other for years- if ever again, at any time in their lives. To fail would mean disaster, the loss of everything Mark and Henry had ever hoped for. Therefore, failure was not an option- as fucking clichéd as that was to say. It was simply not something Mark could allow to happen. He'd just have to get it done the first time, and get it done right- no other option existed. None at all. Finally, Mark hung up, again promising his cousin he would be careful- and that they would see each other again before Christmas. Henry sounded tense, excited- he might not get much sleep tonight. He'd be much too busy wishing Mark good luck- and hoping, praying, that everything would work out like they'd planned. Henry was good at planning- it was one of the things he truly did well, far beyond anyone around him. But no plan was more important than this one, and this one absolutely vital plan he could not be personally involved in. He'd told Mark what he could, given him the best instructions and ideas possible. Hopefully, if Mark was smart- and he was- he would succeed and make it look like the whole thing had been a tragic accident, in no way a deliberate act of sabotage. And murder. Mark went down to dinner at 5:30, while Henry, up in his room in Maine, put on the lower half of his white karate uniform and did sets of a dozen pushups bare-chested, hoping some exercise and a chance to admire his improving physique would distract him from how excited he was. Terrified, nervous, and thrilled beyond words. Henry was sure Mark was going to succeed- Mark was very smart, very clever. He'd understand what to do with the instructions Henry had given him. But there was nothing left to do now besides wait, and to do that Henry needed to exercise until he was too tired to do any more, and from there just go to bed and wait. Hopefully, Mark would figure something out tonight. His prayer for today would be that he and Mark would be set on the path to truly becoming brothers… starting tomorrow. Sitting in the dining room with his father, dressed in a white polo shirt and jeans, Mark found he could do a surprisingly good job of acting normal. Calm, complacent- not at all what he really was underneath. Mark was seething with anger, thrumming with excitement- one wrong twitch and he felt like he might explode. They were having chicken, mashed potatoes and refried beans tonight; Mark wasn't sure whether he hated refried beans or loved them, but they were around all the time. Jack Evans was quite a fan of the good old refried beans. \"Dad,\" Mark said as they sat down, \"I'm sorry about Friday.\" Jack looked at his son uncertainly, wanting to believe this but not quite sure what to think. \"Are you sure, Mark? You seemed pretty angry just yesterday. You ran off and everything- that was scary for me.\" \"I know,\" Mark said quietly, controlling his reaction nicely and dropping his eyes to the table. \"I just was really looking forward to Easter. That's all. When I heard we weren't going…\" Mark sighed. \"I don't know. I just got so mad.\" \"That you did,\" Jack said with a nod. \"I don't blame you for that, Mark. Not really. All I'm asking is that you learn to control your reaction on these things. Don't get so mad at me when something comes up- remember we're on the same side here. I'm trying to help you. And I always will be.\" \"Thanks, Dad,\" Mark said, and he really looked like he meant it this time. Jack and Mark turned to their dinner, both of them having a much better and easier time of it than they'd expected. They talked easily, Mark speaking excitedly of Henry, Jake and Megan- the three big figures in his life now, it seemed. Jake, Mike and John had taken the place of Alan, Wesley and David, and Megan was Mark's girlfriend. Plain and simple. Henry, meanwhile, was making good progress on getting in shape and staying there, just as Mark so clearly was. He was also doing well in his karate classes, ranked a green belt just as Mark was. Dinner took perhaps half an hour. Towards the end of it, Mark offered to help clean up the dishes once they were done, an offer made in just the same way he'd always done years ago. It was good old Mark, just as nice and well-meaning as you could ever ask for. After that was done, Mark thanked his father again for all he'd been doing, and told his father what he'd been thinking about a lot today. \"I was thinking about how much I love you and Mom,\" Mark said. \"I don't want to lose you, too.\" Jack looked at Mark, surprised and touched. They hugged briefly, and there was a gleam in Jack's eyes that might have been tears. Mark's eyes also gleamed with a seemingly-identical light, but to anyone who knew it was actually very, very different. Outwardly Mark appeared moved just as his father was, but actually he was holding back laughter. He really believes it . The fuckin' phony . Mark went to bed early that night; he had his watch set for 11:30, the time when he'd head downstairs to the basement and get shit done. Mark knew he probably would not sleep much in the intervening time, but he had to try. A lot of heavy shit was getting ready to come down, and he had to rest up while he could. Mark began to do his usual routine of stripping for bed; he loved the way that the covers felt against his body, and it was just another way of reminding himself of how he'd triumphed over so many of his past weaknesses. Mark had once been ashamed of being naked, afraid- now he just found it to be another reminder of how much he had to be proud of. Then Mark realised he was getting ready to set the damn house on fire. Wouldn't quite do to go outside naked- not if there weren't a lot of hot girls waiting to see him. Mark changed his routine for tonight; he would go to bed dressed. But not too dressed. Mark soon realised he was not going to go outside in his initial choice- his old blue-gray pajamas, a favourite of his since he'd gotten them at age eleven. He could hardly go running outside in his new 'bed clothes' as there were none, but upon attempting to put them on found they were too tight. Mark was at first startled, then frustrated- and then he started to grin. The clothes he'd first chosen didn't fit anymore because Mark had grown too muscular in the past months. Through his awesome gains in physical strength alone, Mark had outgrown his old clothes. What about the stuff Henry had got him? That might still work. Henry was always looking ahead- perhaps he'd anticipated that change in his cou-brother. Come to think of it, that seemed likely to be true- Mark remembered a lot of what Henry had given him had felt loose on the first try. Mark went to his closet- pausing as he so often did to admire himself in a mirror he had set up by his bed- and sifted through the clothes he had there, then to his dresser. Finally, he settled on a dark red t-shirt. Slipping it on after putting on a pair of boxer-briefs, Mark smiled as he realised the new clothes did indeed fit him just fine. They didn't feel so loose now. Oddly enough, Mark conked right out when he went to bed at 8:30. Perhaps all that exercise had tired him out; perhaps the constant adrenaline high was wearing on him a bit also. Whatever the case, Mark fell asleep for the next few hours, surprising his father when he came upstairs to check on his son- Mark usually was up much later than that these days. Maybe Mark was tired out after Friday's events; it would certainly make sense of he was. Jack went to bed himself at 9:00, not even once guessing that his son was awaiting the beeping of his watch in the next room, and that his own son had decided that he had not even another day left to live. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Mark sat up in bed, hurriedly reaching over and pressing a button on his watch to silence it. He had the strangest, most ridiculous fear that his father would hear the watch, and somehow through its sinister beeping discover his plan. Listening for a few moments, though, Mark heard nothing at all. The house was quiet. Just as it should be. Getting up and carefully moving out of his room, Mark crept down the hall barefoot. He moved silently, even making sure to breathe as quietly as possible. He slowed his pace even more as he neared Jack's room, but no unusual sounds could be heard from inside. Jack was asleep- just as he should have been. Mark turned and carefully made his way downstairs. His heart pounded now, and his eyes were alive and bright with excitement. He was getting ready to kill for the first time. He was getting ready to set events in motion that would reunite him with Henry. After all, what other option was there? Jack and Wallace were the only two children of their generation, and the Evans family was not a very large clan in any case. Some surnames could lose a while nuclear family and flourish anyway for generations; the Evans family relied on only a few descendants each time to carry on the family name. Mark did not know this for a fact, but was certain that if his father had written any kind of a will- given any sort of instructions for \"the unthinkable\" at all, it was for Mark to be adopted by Wallace and Susan. It was the most logical choice if something were to happen to Jack, and was a likely outcome anyway. It was a chance Mark was plenty willing to take. The problem with furnace fires was that they normally started in the winter. In the warmer months, they were obviously off more often than not- the only thing they were needed for then was hot water, and that didn't require as much constant running as heating the house did. Still, the furnace was in some way active year-round. All those pipes, all those wires; there was a good chance for something to go wrong there. Especially if some frayed wires had a few fluffy pieces of insulation fall from the walls down on them, and a blanket was lying nearby on the dryer… Mark knew what he had to do. Henry had given him all the details he needed, really, and as he found a few tools, arranged the scene in the basement, and prepared to go to work, Mark realised Henry's instructions had been more than good enough. He made a note to thank Henry later. Stripping the wires was the hardest part; Mark nearly electrocuted himself doing so. After a couple of good zaps, he went and found some rubber gloves and returned to his work. Then, there he was- standing there in the dark of the basement utility room, the rubber coating of a few copper wires nicely exposed for him to drop some insulation on. The brown paper that held it into the walls ran a little short at the top, and once in a while small bits of it would drift down to the concrete floor of the room. Never big puffs of it, but hey- accidents could happen. Just the same as that blanket lying on the top of the dryer could very well be left with some of it draped over the left side, well in reach of the wires if that pink insulation was to catch fire. And so it did. Mark wanted to go get something to use as an accelerant- the gas can for the lawnmower, kerosene- but Henry had specifically warned against that. If the fire department guys picking through the wreckage suspected arson at all, real investigators would be called, and Mark's problems would take a big turn for the worse. So Mark sprinkled some insulation on the exposed wires- Henry assured him the evidence of that would be burned away when the whole thing caught fire- and stepped back. After just a moment, it made \"zap\" noise and caught, the pink fluffy stuff catching fire and burning nicely. The blanket, meanwhile, was meant to be flame-retardant- but it was never claimed to be flame-proof. It began to burn too, and Mark moved a set of towels on top of the dryer, making sure they were just inches from the wall- and all that wood, paper and insulation. Much of the house was stone on the outside, but its insides weren't. In there were plenty of things to burn with. Paint, paper, rugs, so many hundreds of feet of treated wood. Insulation, plaster- everything, all of it, able to burn. Mark waited until he had a nice fire going in the basement before going anywhere. He briefly closed his eyes and tilted his head back, feeling the heat on his face and wishing he had a stick and a marshmallow. Then his senses returned as the fire blazed into life in front of him- it had found the basement wall. Mark darted out of the room and crept upstairs in a hurry. As he fled, he took a roll of string out of his pocket- light wool string, plenty capable of burning and never being found as evidence, but also quite good enough to trip a human being if used right. Mark stopped at the head of the stairs, working quickly, then left a few lines of string pulled taut across the top of the stairs and returned to his room. He briefly moved about in there, wondering if he should take anything. Could he? Certainly no more than a thing or two in his pockets; if anyone found Mark lugging all his junk out of the house before or after, that would look a little suspicious to say the least. By no means could any part of this look like Mark had been expecting it. So Mark took just one thing. His wallet- which everybody knew he kept on him all the time anyway, and no more. Mark wished he could save something else- anything else. The Italian switchblade, for example. It would have to be consumed in the flames. What choice was there? If anyone- anybody at all- discovered the blade on him afterwards, Mark knew he'd have a lot of explaining to do. There just was nothing for it. Nothing at all. Then Mark's eyes lit on the hand-carved, one-foot model of the HMS Vanguard , the pride of the modern-day Royal Navy and one of the world's finest ballistic missile submarines. Fuck 'em if they won't let me have that , Mark thought bitterly, and placed the submarine on the rug, just inside the door. His father would pass right by it if he came in here, looking for Mark- and Mark would return for it once he knew his father wasn't getting out. He'd flee out his window and onto the roof- just like he'd done when he'd snuck out to kill Sean Walters' dog. The fire must have found plenty to munch on down there in the basement, because before long Mark was sure he could smell traces of smoke drifting upstairs. The fire alarms should have been going off- but Jack, though well-meaning and diligent, was also at times forgetful. An alarm or two had mysteriously shorted out tonight- or perhaps its batteries just hadn't been replaced on time. The ones upstairs were working, but by the time they picked up what was going on it wouldn't matter for much longer. Mark streaked out of his room and down the hall, taking care to keep his movements quiet. He hid in the hallway bathroom, just across from the stairs. The second-floor fire alarms would be going off any second now. Any second now… and from there the strings at the top of the stairs would soon do their work. And if they didn't? If, perhaps, the job needed one more finishing touch? Mark was all right with that. It was what karate was for. Beep-beep-beep! Beep-beep-beep ! The fire alarm in the second floor hallway commenced its unearthly screeching, quite good at its sole job of making itself impossible to ignore for any sleeping inhabitants of the house. Mark resisted the urge to cover his ears, instead concentrating for the sound of his father once the man was up and on his feet. \"What on earth ?\" Jack said, cursing and stumbling out into the hallway. Then he smelled the smoke, and sensed instantly that this was no minor problem. He couldn't imagine how it had started, and was bewildered none of the downstairs alarms were going off- but Jack knew right away this was real. \"Mark!\" Jack yelled, hurrying down the hallway to the open door of his son's room. \"MARK!\" Mark wasn't in his room. Why wasn't he in his room? Maybe he'd gone downstairs for a midnight snack… maybe he was still there! Trapped in the kitchen, too terrified to move as flames crept up from the basement- for that was likely where the fire had started. Jack sprung into action, determined not to waste time questioning how and where this fire had begun- all that mattered now was that it had begun, and was going to kill Jack and his son very quickly if they didn't both get out, and get out fast. Jack sprinted down the hall, shouting Mark's name and praying for him to answer. He hurried towards the stairs, sure Mark was somewhere down there. He'd have answered by now if he was up here, after all- they had their disagreements sometimes, and more so lately than usual, but Mark had no reason to hide at a time like this. Rushing towards the way down to the first floor, Jack ran right into the lines of string. They gave way and snapped under the force of Jack's momentum, but not before they tripped him up, just like Mark had intended. Jack never even saw the string, believing he'd simply made a mistake in his hurry to get downstairs. He tumbled down the stairs the hard way, landing painfully at the bottom, finding it was difficult to move. Had he broken something, maybe? There was a good chance that was what had happened. That was all he needed right now. The front door! It was almost within reach. \"Mark!\" Jack yelled, knowing he still had a chance of getting out. Maybe he could get to the front door and open it himself, or perhaps Mark could get out from wherever he was and open the door for him. Either way, there was still a chance for the both of them to live. Jack could not- would not- give up on that. \"Dad!\" the cry came, and Jack was almost overcome with relief even as he noticed with shock how much smoke there was on the first floor, and caught sight of the growing flames down the hall. Then Jack realised something was out of place here. That cry- it had come from upstairs ! Mark had been upstairs the whole time ! Why hadn't he said anything? What did that even mean? \"Mark!\" Jack yelled back, \"I'm downstairs, near the front door! Come on!\" \"Oh, I'm coming, Dad!\" Mark sang, and Jack found that tone, that sound of almost mocking good cheer, to be beyond inappropriate. It was bizarre, almost wrong how happy Mark sounded. Why should Mark be happy , at a time like this ? After just a moment Mark's form appeared at the top of the stairs, and he bounded down them, darting towards Jack with such speed it looked like he was coming in- -to attack? Jack recognized it as Mark flew down the stairs, going into a flying leap as he reached the last four steps. It was one of Mark's karate moves. One he probably was not yet supposed to know, but had one way or another figured out regardless. Mark had an almost joyful expression of absolute focus and intent on his face; he knew what he was trying to do, and was happy because he was moments away from doing it. \"Christmas is coming early, Dad! At least for me!\" Mark cried, not even caring about all the smoky air he was breathing into say that. He wasted barely a second or two saying that, then sprang off the steps, landing squarely on Jack's torso and slamming a flattened hand into his neck. The attack was meant to be a killing blow, and it did its job well; Mark banged his knees horribly on the landing but saw Jack wasn't going to have to worry about his knees or anything else, ever again. His eyes looked towards Mark, glassy and uncomprehending as marbles were. It's done, then , Mark thought, then gagged and coughed as the smoke began to really reach him. The damn house was burning up! But Mark had made his decision. He was not leaving that goddamn submarine behind. It was enough that he was leaving everything else he owned to burn; Mark was not about to hand over that hand-carved, beautifully-polished model submarine Henry had given him. Forcing himself to his feet and ignoring the pain in his knees, Mark crouched low and sprinted back up the stairs. He threw himself into the bathroom, grabbing the wet towel and the one-foot model submarine, placing the towel over his mouth to shield himself from the smoke as he ran. Mark bolted down the hall and into his room, pausing just a moment to set both items down and force open the window in his room that looked over the backyard. Mark got out onto the roof, leaving almost everything he owned behind. Tying the towel about his neck, Mark took hold of the submarine model and hurried across the roof to the tree that stood near it. It was maybe a ten, maybe twelve-foot drop from here. Mark didn't want to risk breaking one of his legs. He gripped the submarine's conning tower in his teeth and jumped for the tree, grabbing one of its upper branches in both hands and swinging down to a lower one, then dropping down to the ground. The whole event had already pushed Mark's health towards its limits; he was grimy, sweaty, dirty and tired, and knew he'd inhaled more smoke than he should have. Damn cigarettes , Mark thought, and laughed crazily. Fuck giving up the habit, though. He'd chain-smoke a pack a week and fight his way out of a burning house every month before doing that . The fire was coming along very rapidly now, hungrily grasping for anything and everything that would light. Mark could see the neighbors coming out of their houses, and could hear the sound of fire engines racing down Falconbridge towards the neighborhood. He was exhausted, but forced himself to his feet. He had to continue, he had to make sure he got away. No point staying around to get killed- something that was still very possible, sitting here in the backyard. They spotted him first, the Johnsons. They lived across the street and were the ones to call 911, Mr. Nick Johnson having noticed the glow of the flames from his kitchen window while up for a midnight glass of beer. Now he and his wife saw the twelve-year-old kid Mark Evans come wandering down the lawn towards them, appearing to not even notice the flames and smoke consuming the house behind him. He was dirty and wore a tired, haggard expression- and he was stubbornly clutching a model submarine of some kind in one hand. A strange thing to do, but people grabbed the oddest things when running out of a burning house. Mark had chosen to save his model submarine, apparently. Mark Evans barely seemed to hear the cries of alarm from the neighbors around him, didn't respond to Mr. or Mrs. Johnson at all. Instead he crossed the street, sat down at the curb at the Johnson's lawn, and gazed over at the fire taking his house and everything in it. \"He'll be here,\" Mark said distantly, looking up at the Johnsons for a moment. \"He'll be here. He'll make it, he has to.\" After a few moments Mr. and Mrs. Johnson realised Mark meant his father. Jack Evans didn't show up, though. Only more flames did, and as quickly as the fire trucks arrived, by the time they got there and started getting the whole mess under control, the house was a total loss. Watching the whole scene, Mark was briefly forgotten by most as the firefighters battled the flames and the two next-door neighbors were evacuated from their own houses just in case. He breathed only with effort, coughing now and again as he fought to once again clear his lungs. He was tired, and knew he wouldn't sleep at all for a while yet tonight. He could hear the elder Johnsons urging him to get up, assuring him that he could wait for his father with them, that they would get him water and let the firefighters know he was here. Mark thought this was all well and good, and he allowed himself to be led away, remembering that soon it would be time to put his head in his hands and bawl. He was good at that. But as he headed across the Johnsons' lawn and towards the safety of their house, Mark looked back was just a moment and smiled.[Chapter 16] Chapter XVI- Means & Ends Wallace and Susan flew to Phoenix, Arizona just a few days before Easter. They'd gotten the call early in the morning on March 22nd, receiving the devastating news about the fire, and how lucky Mark had been to get out. Jack hadn't been so fortunate, and an inconsolable Mark was now at a local hospital, staying there while he tried to figure out what he was supposed to do from here. He'd lost both his parents. When he'd heard the news, Henry had not slept more than a single hour each night until they flew out to Arizona. He had not laughed, he had not cried. Henry had just stared at things- the wall, the floor, his parents when they spoke to him. It was shock, a reaction in many ways similar to Mark's. When he wasn't crying or sleeping, Mark was absolutely silent, staring at nothing at all no matter where he looked. Henry was only responsive about one thing- his demand to go with his parents to Arizona. Once that was agreed on, and the fact that Mark was alive and okay confirmed, Henry calmed down a bit. But the day before the flight, he barely slept at all. Wallace and Susan could tell because once they were on the flight, Henry went face-down in a bag of airline peanuts. He fell asleep for the rest of the three-hour flight, his face looking worn and tired- nothing like the lively, resilient kid he normally was. He kind of looked like hell- and it only made Susan and Wallace worry more. If this was how Henry looked, wasting away with worry over the death and near-death in the family… how could Mark be looking anything besides worse? Connie had wanted to go, too- she'd been distressed in the extreme over losing her Uncle Jack, and Mark's narrow escape was hardly any better. It had been Henry who told her; sitting at his desk staring at the wall for two hours straight, Henry had spoken the news when Connie showed up at his doorway. She didn't much like her older brother, and had the distinct impression he wasn't too fond of her. But even so, Connie sensed something was bothering Henry very much. He didn't just stare at the wall for no particular reason, and looked like he hadn't slept in a day. So Connie had asked what was wrong. Henry just said bluntly, \"You know Uncle Jack? He's dead. Mark's not.\" Henry's bluntness hadn't been all bad, in a way- it had spared his parents the trouble of trying to figure out how best to explain this to Connie. It would not have been easy; not by any stretch of the imagination. In a way Wallace and Susan were grateful to Henry for his blunt way of dealing with death; he cut himself off from his emotions, functioning on the absolute minimum of things. At least Henry could keep going, better than most. But the option of Connie going had been ruled out from the outset. She had always liked Uncle Jack a great deal, but the flight was booked very last-minute, and Wallace was lucky to get even three seats on the same flight like he did. Connie stayed with Alice Davenport while her brother and parents went to Arizona, with the promise that she would get to see Mark just as soon as they got back. It had been a given that Mark would be taken in by Jack's brother and sister-in-law if anything happened to him; those arrangements had been made years ago between the two brothers. Jack had been so lucky for so many years, done so well- and it had all suddenly come to an end. Wallace just didn't understand it. And of course there was Mark. The latest word Wallace had gotten when he got on the flight to go out to Arizona was that Mark was now refusing to eat; the hospital staff were debating over what to do about that, but said that Mark looked like he might get violent if they tried to force-feed him. That might not go well, and trying that wouldn't be good right now anyway, given how sensitive his throat and lungs were from the fire. There was no serious damage, not as far as anyone could tell- but anything that would strain his lungs or throat would be a bad idea right now. Bringing Henry turned out to be a better idea than anyone could have imagined. When the two boys were reunited just a day before Easter, both had looked like death warmed over. Gaunt faces, haggard expressions, dark circles under their eyes. They both looked like they'd been through hell. But when Henry caught sight of his cousin, his features lit up again for the first time in days, and so did Mark's. They rushed to each other in Mark's room in the hospital, hugging each other tightly and crying into each other's shoulders. Scared like they'd never been in their lives, both boys sobbed out their relief. He's all right, they both thought. At least he's all right. Everyone watching was grateful to see Mark come back to himself a bit. He was still pale and tired-looking, sleeping poorly and completely disoriented most of the time. Mark seemed to be having trouble remembering even where his room had been in the house, and he could offer next to nothing about what had happened. He'd just blanked out on the whole thing, it seemed like, and nobody was willing to push Mark on it. He'd been through a lot. The one thing that did seem to help was Henry. He was by Mark's side constantly after his arrival, doing whatever Mark needed done and constantly busying himself around the hospital on errands. His politeness and concern for his cousin impressed many on the staff working that floor, and Henry was well-known by the nurses and doctors dealing with Mark in his last two days there. Henry would not leave until he had to at the end of the day, and even then, back at the hotel room his parents had gotten, Henry would not go to sleep unless he was told Mark had. While visiting, he wouldn't eat unless Mark had started eating, and once or twice was suspected of simply handing his food over to Mark anyway. Henry's devotion to his cousin was touching, especially for Susan; she had never imagined just how much her boy cared. Mark was the one known for being caring and emotional, but clearly Henry could be that way if he wanted to. Perhaps he just wasn't especially good at showing it. Mark left the hospital the day after Easter, and Wallace got a two-bedroom room at the hotel so the two boys could share a room. Mark remained subdued for all his first day out; he said next to nothing and only really got up to eat and go to the bathroom, then just went back and slept some more. The funeral was on the second day in April, and Wallace was busy making the arrangements. It pained him greatly, but he knew there was no choice but to do it. Jack would have done the same for him. Then came the funeral itself. On April 2nd, 1994, the Evans family and an assortment of neighbors, employees, associates and friends said goodbye to Jack Evans. He was buried on the same reddish-orange hillside as his wife, on that barren cemetery grounds overlooking the open miles of desert. Many people came on that day in April, more than Wallace had expected. He was deeply saddened at losing his brother, and could hardly bear to think of what a tragedy it was, losing Janice and Jack in so short a time. They had been good, wonderful people, generous and considerate of others in a way that really was remarkable in the present times. Some families and some people seemed able to navigate the ages with relative ease, their honor whole and their values intact. They remained pillars of decency and strength in a time when such people were becoming all too rare indeed. And Mark, the son of two such people, was one of the nicest, most good-natured kids Wallace or Susan had ever met. It just made no sense that of all the people who had to go before their time, Jack and Janice should be the ones. Mark's parents were gone now, and he was clearly devastated. That was about as close or as accurate a word as Wallace could find; nothing else seemed to fit. Mark and Henry looked quite handsome in their black suits, identically made and tailored by a friend of Jack's for the occasion. He told Wallace he would accept no charge on this one- for Jack and his family, this was on the house. The two boys were inseparable from the day they reunited at the hospital, almost never leaving each other's side. During the funeral they both did a remarkable job of imitating the men around them- stoic and upright, they made their faces masks that concealed the grief they really felt. The women were allowed to cry- that was all right. But some unspoken tradition mandated that the men could not. Not now, at least- they were the leaders, the decision makers- they had to be strong. Wallace, observing the boys throughout the funeral, figured they were each making a real effort to hold up under everything that was going on. They had to be strong, needed to be- not so much for the adults around them as for each other. Henry was making himself hold up and keep going because Mark needed him, and Mark was doing his best to carry on because Henry needed him. They needed each other. Wallace, and Susan, resolved to give the boys their space during the event, both found themselves thankful for the close friendship Mark and Henry had so clearly established. Now, more than ever, strong bonds like that were needed to keep the Evans family going- and Mark needed friends like Henry more than ever before in his life. \"Mark has Henry,\" Wallace and his wife heard more than once, as people came to give their condolences and best wishes for Mark. \"At least Mark has Henry. You have that to be thankful for.\" Mark didn't cry at the funeral, and he did none of that during the day before either. He just remained silent, and when he wasn't quietly sitting in some corner he was sleeping. He was sleeping too damn much lately, and Wallace was starting to worry about it. Mark showed some signs of life, of some possibility that he might overcome even this and move on… but only when Henry talked to him. With everybody else he was in a daze. He didn't seem to know what to think about anything, or if anything he was seeing or hearing was even real. Susan spoke with Mark briefly at the funeral; he kept looking over at his father's coffin, then looking away and shuddering. But he kept looking back. He managed to concentrate enough on Susan to ask her what was going to happen next. \"What am I gonna do now?\" Mark asked, in a voice that said he was quite frightened at having no idea. He was lost in the world now; adrift without any parents left. \"What am I gonna do now?\" He said it again, amazed at how frightening it was to think about. The reality he was faced with now wasn't a pleasant thing. All through his life, even when he'd lost his mother, Mark had some idea of what was going to come next. But Susan had an answer for that, even if she couldn't answer anything else. Kneeling to give Mark a hug, she looked him right in the eyes. \"Mark,\" she said quietly, \"You'll be coming back to Maine with us. Your dad made sure that if anything happened to him, we could step in and take care of you.\" She paused, unsure what to make of that odd, unreadable expression in his eyes. \"You'll be all right, Mark,\" Susan said. \"We'll take care of you.\" Mark regarded Susan in silence for a few moments, then embraced her tightly, shutting his eyes against the tears forcing their way forward again. \"Thanks, Aunt Susan,\" Mark said quietly. \"Thank you so much.\" The funeral ceremony itself began, and Mark stood in silence all the while as the priest talked, and the black wood casket was lowered into the freshly-dug grave. Henry was as always by his side, but had nothing to say. He merely watched and waited, patiently observing everything and everyone around him. Of course, he paid close attention to how everyone had reacted to the news, the way that people were talking about the fire. No one- not anybody- suspected the fire had been started by a human being. It was an accident; an electrical fire of some kind had started in the basement and spread from there. The whole thing was an accident- tragic, and unforeseeable. No boy had played any part in creating it. None whatsoever. Henry was also interested in Mark. He stood by his cousin every day since they were reunited not just for public appearances- he wanted to play every role he could in making sure Mark was regarded as the sympathetic victim in all this- but also as a gesture of real devotion. Henry felt so close to Mark now it was like words, for them, had become obsolete. They understood each other so well, gestures and smiles or frowns could convey a whole conversation's worth of meaning. Mark was doing beautifully well- Henry knew it. He knew because when they'd been alone in an empty room of the funeral home during the wake, Mark had turned to Henry and turned the blonde to face him, a Cheshire-cat-like grin on his face. Quietly, Mark had whispered, \"We did it,\" and the two boys had embraced, hugging each other tightly. This was the happiest day of their lives- but they had no choice but to behave that it was actually the opposite. The crowd began drifting away, and Henry soon left with his parents to leave Mark alone for a little while. He stood over the open grave, gazing silently down at the black coffin. The wind blew in across the desert and pushed lightly at him now and then, but Mark didn't notice. Finally, once everyone had withdrawn to the cars or begun to leave, the boy with the auburn hair gazed down at the coffin with a tense, emotional look on his face. Was it anger, or was it sadness? Anyone who could have seen Mark's face would have found it quite impossible to tell. Mark gazed down solemnly. He had no words to say. After a few moments, he found one. Not a word or sentence of farewell, but a final goodbye all the same. Mark carefully spat down on the coffin and turned around, walking back towards Wallace's rented Eagle sedan and his waiting family- his new family- without so much as a backwards glance. Taking care of the last will & testament of Jack Evans and dealing with his various properties and loose ends would take a little time. The essentials, though, were done by the time Wallace prepared to take his family- including his nephew, whom he was now adopting as his own son on his brother's behalf- back to Maine. Wallace hated to admit it, but dispensing with what his brother had owned and settling his affairs was admittedly much easier with so much of it having burned up in the fire. It was a terrible thing to think, but in a way Wallace was grateful. At the very least, he was spared having to make a lengthy affair of this. He was able to set his brother's affairs to rest- and set Jack to rest- and just be done with it. Anything that would make that process quicker, Wallace was grateful for. No matter what it was. Mark and Henry continued to be supportive of each other as they prepared for the flight home; both wore black armbands on the trip home as symbols of mourning. Outwardly they were slowly picking up the pieces, struggling to reorient themselves and find a way to move on. Underneath, though, the boys were ecstatic. They wanted to jump for joy, so happy they didn't know what to do with themselves. They'd gotten what they wanted. They were brothers now- brothers until the end. When Mark Evans flew home with his new family on April 4th, 1994, he carried with him one suitcase- one suitcase, carrying all he owned. He'd managed to say goodbye to some of his buddies before going, and Jake Schwarz promised to give that sissy Alan Parks a good sucker-punch for Mark before the end of the year. Mark wished for the time to stop by Megan's house and pay her a visit for a while- Maybe a whole night if she's up for it, he thought with a smile- but it just wasn't possible. He called her and said his goodbyes, like he did with the rest of his friends. The flight home took some three hours, but Mark passed the time easily enough, napping beside Henry on the plane. Mark was wearing his jeans and white polo when he got off the plane at the Portland airport. Henry was in a dark blue sweater and khakis- he seemed rather fond of that combination- and had brought a replacement tan winter coat, fur-lined, to replace the one he'd lost in the fire. The ride home was quiet and subdued, nobody saying much. Mark began to ask about things like resuming karate classes, now in the class Henry was a part of, and also about perhaps resuming school before the fall. It would be a challenge to arrange so many things in so short a time, but neither Susan nor Wallace objected. They understood; Mark was attempting to reorient himself by restoring what things he could to their normal presence in his life. He'd been doing karate, playing soccer and going to school before- one way he could start making sense of things again was to begin doing those things again, now. When they got home, it was a mild day; cold, still, but noticeably the beginning of spring. The bitter edge of winter was slowly fading, and Mark didn't need any gloves or hat. Just the tan winter coat Henry had given him, the same kind as the blonde was wearing himself. When they pulled into the driveway, Mark gazed up at the big, impressive white house, with its three floors and a basement and plenty of extra rooms and bedrooms. He was going to be staying in Henry's room for right now, but he and Henry had already discussed hatching a proposal that Mark move into Richard's room before long. Maybe not this week, or next month- but within the next year or so. And it would likely happen. The years were steadily passing since the loss of Richard, and now another boy was present to liven up the house. Wallace's feeling that the room was turning into a museum would surely take hold for Susan, too- or at least, she'd soon have little choice but to repurpose the room as Mark's own, and move on. But that was for later. So was Mark returning to school, resuming his karate classes, and accompanying Henry's team to their practices and so many other things. All that would be happening soon, but not today. That was for tomorrow, for later. Mark would concern himself with those things soon enough. The two boys hopped eagerly out of the car, gazing up at the house and then bounding towards it, sprinting forward and playfully shoving at each other as they dashed through the slowly-melting snow. Wallace and Susan were a bit surprised to see the two of them laughing and playing like this, but found no reason to complain. Susan was struck by the sight of the two boys bounding up the steps of their house, looking almost exactly alike from behind. They were truly inseparable, those two. Susan had never seen two boys become such good friends so quickly- not in all her life. But it was a good thing that this was happening; a very good thing, indeed. Wallace and Susan let Henry and Mark into the house, helping Mark get settled back into Henry's room before heading out to go pick up Connie. Henry watched their car head away down the street, gazing down from the upstairs hallway window that overlooked the front yard. He returned to his room after a few moments, going into his dresser and plucking out the brand-new gold-plated Zippo lighter and fresh pack of Virginia-made cigarettes he'd been saving just for Mark. Turning around and handing them to the auburn-haired boy with a smile on his face, Henry said, \"Welcome home, Mark. We're brothers.\" The two boys hugged fiercely for a moment, Mark grinning and managing to force out, \"Good to be here. Brother.\" Then they separated, and Henry grinned as he gestured at the pack of cigarettes. \"Come on,\" he said, starting to head down the hall towards the bathroom. \"Let's go fuck up our lungs some more.\" Mark laughed and followed him, and within a minute they had the bathroom door closed and the fan on. I could get used to this , Mark thought with a smile. I think I like this just fine .[Chapter 17] Chapter XVII- New Beginnings The changes in the Evans household became evident right away. Mark and Henry were soon back to their old selves, laughing and play-fighting constantly like a pair of tiger cubs. They were the best of friends, and ceased referring to each other as cousins the day Mark returned to Maine. From that day on they were brothers, and would always refer to one another as such. Wallace and Susan talked about this in private once or twice. Were they embracing this new life too quickly- were they, perhaps, forgetting about Jack a little too soon? But that worry didn't last long for either of the Evans parents. Mark needed to live on, to take advantage of the life he had instead of focusing on his own near-death. There wasn't anything wrong with him making such impressive progress as this- nothing at all. It meant there was hope for Mark, and Wallace and Susan both agreed that few things ever to be found in the world were quite so beautiful as hope. Connie was delighted to see Mark return to the household, cheerfully welcoming him when she learned he was going to stay. Henry's previous shortness with Connie slowly vanished, and while he didn't suddenly strike up a friendship with his sister, Henry did leave her alone much more frequently. This only endeared Connie to Mark as her new brother more; she rightly attributed her older brother's better mood to the presence of her second big brother. Connie never entered Henry's room anymore, though, even with Mark present- her new brother was now supportive of her old one's policy. The kid sister was never, ever allowed in Henry's room- she was to stop at the doorway and go no farther than that. Mark and Henry soon were together clamoring for a set of weights, and before long were together working out in their room after school, almost every day. After some extended talks with the head of Henry's junior high school, Mark returned to classes starting his second week back. He and Henry were in the principal's office that Thursday; apparently a few boys had decided to try razzing the new kid, and together Henry and Mark had reacted in a very unfavorable manner. They both promised to stay out of such trouble in the future, though, and in any case the point was made. One area where the Evans brothers truly excelled from the start was in karate class. The sensei, Mr. Kenji, was amazed at how in tune the two clearly were; when they sparred other boys they always seemed a move ahead, and were some of the strongest boys in the class. When they sparred each other, they fought more fiercely than any of the other boys ever did, but only seemed to enjoy the competition. During Mark's second week in Maine, Henry confided during class that he had been hoping, wishing for a chance to get away with a full-contact attack. The sensei wouldn't allow it, he said, and Henry just wanted to show these dorks what he could really do. Just for once. So Mark and Henry talked about it, and before long they came up with a plan. During the Thursday class after school, Henry as usual volunteered to spar with one of the boys. It was the lean, athletically-built John LaFleur, the dark-brown-haired kid from Henry's school soccer team. He was a midfielder alongside Henry, and one of the only boys who had the courage to routinely face Henry on the mat during karate classes. Mr. Kenji was normally quite an attentive man, able to keep watch over all the goings-on in his dojo during a given class, but Mark Evans was one of the most talented students he'd seen in years. He kept asking questions Thursday afternoon, and each of them turned out to be one that was not only interesting to Mark, but also to the other boys in the class. Mark was making a good impression, it seemed; he was casual and outgoing, playing on his new-kid-in-town image and making the most of it. The boys in the class liked him, but were fighting to hide their astonishment that he was the brother of someone as odd as Henry. So it was quite a surprise to Mr. Kenji during class that day when he was busy answering questions and he heard an abrupt, sharp smack- John LaFleur flew clear off the mat he'd been standing on and over to the next, gasping hard and struggling to sit up. Henry had his fists raised and just finished lowering one foot to the floor when Mr. Kenji turned; he'd taken the momentary distraction of the sensei and the class to kick Johnny LaFleur just as hard as he could. \"Hey!\" Kenji barked, rushing over to the two boys. \"What's going on here? Did I say you could use a full-contact kick, Mr. Evans?\" \"No, sensei,\" Henry answered promptly. \"He said I could,\" the blonde added, nodding to Johnny, who was lying on the mat and recovering his breath. Mr. Kenji looked over at Johnny LaFleur, watching intently and making sure he was able to sit up. The boy with the brown-black hair looked up, but not at Mr. Kenji. He had his eyes locked with Henry's. The blonde gazed at him intently, his eyes a warning. Go along with it, Henry's eyes said. Just go with what I said. So John nodded. \"I wanted to see what it was like,\" he said simply. \"It's all right, sir.\" He wasn't about to contradict somebody who'd kicked him that hard; he felt ready to barf his guts up. How was Henry this good? John was one of the best boys in the class, but Henry was always in the lead. He was faster, stronger, and just plain better. He might not have realised it, but Henry was the envy of every boy in the class. They all wanted to be as good as he was- but none could understand why he was such a callous jerk. Try to ask him for anything, ask him to help you learn what he knew, he'd tell you to get fucked. What could you do but ostracize somebody like that? Henry enjoyed the opportunity to land a full-contact blow for the first time in his life, but Mark talked to him about it when they got home. Henry did well in karate, did well in soccer, was good-looking, in great shape, and dressed well. How, with all that in mind, wasn't he the most popular kid in school? What was stopping him? \"I don't know,\" Henry said, shrugging as he picked up a pair of fifteen-pound weights and began lifting them, working on the strength of his arms. \"I hate those dorks.\" Mark understood that flat, dismissive attitude; Henry felt the kids around him at school were less than he was. Therefore, he ignored them- that or push them around, not even bothering to hide his contempt. Mark didn't see the guys he'd gone to school with in Arizona any differently, but the difference was that he understood you couldn't hold yourself completely aloof, as Henry was doing. Not if you wanted to be hot shit in high school. \"I do too, man,\" Mark said as he lifted a couple of dumbbells himself. \"But you gotta play the game.\" Henry paused, looking at Mark uncertainly. \"What game?\" \" The game,\" Mark repeated, his face taking on a sly smile. He grunted as he worked through the repetitions; he was doing just a few more every week. Twenty was his average for every exercise- twenty each time. And he would sometimes revisit a given exercise during a workout, with the result that he would ultimately do forty or sixty pushups in total. It took effort, real effort- but he could do it. From the look of his upper body, Henry's zeal for physical exercise was no less sincere. He had ambitions of popularity himself, all right- as well as having an obvious interest in the many other benefits that came with being in shape. Being able to intimidate kids much more effectively most of the time, beating them up if they fought back some of the time- there was no shortage of benefits to being in shape for boys like Mark and Henry. \"All right, jerkoff,\" Henry said with mocking courtesy, \"What's this game? Henry likes games.\" \"Well,\" Mark said, setting down his weights and beginning a set of sit-ups, \"You know how you put a mask on, right? Talking to adults?\" \"Keep your voice down, man,\" Henry grunted, loving the bittersweet pain that came with pushing his muscles to their limits. He loved that feeling of soreness that often followed the next day- it meant he'd done a good workout, and would be that much stronger once the soreness had faded. \"You know what I mean, though,\" Mark insisted. \"Right?\" \"Yeah, yeah,\" Henry said. \"So what about that? Those idiots I-\" he paused, smiled a little. \"Those idiots we go to school with aren't adults. They're kids.\" \"But so are we,\" Mark said, and when Henry visibly bristled at that, Mark added, \"As far as they're concerned.\" He paused. \"You wanna be cool, don't you? One of those guys all the girls wanna, you know-\" \"Fuck,\" Henry said simply. \"We can say fuck, Mark. We're both guys here.\" \"Well, I know I am,\" Mark smirked. \"Whatever,\" Henry laughed, shaking his head and setting his weights down. Sitting down on his bed and looking over at Mark, he laughed again. It was getting close to bedtime; Henry walked over to the door and closed it most of the way. Wallace wouldn't permit the boys or Connie to sleep with their door shut, but it could be almost shut. That was fine, apparently, and Henry wanted to do the best he could to ensure there wouldn't be any unwanted listeners. There never were anyway; Connie knew better than to eavesdrop on either Mark or Henry, and Wallace and Susan trusted their son- sons- too much to bother. Henry and Mark matter-of-factly stripped and folded their clothes by the dresser, neatly and properly as usual. The process of doing this in front of the other didn't bother either Mark or Henry now; it wasn't like they were checking each other out. They were mature enough not to make some kind of a big deal about it. Lying in his bed with the covers pulled up over his waist- quite narcissistic these days, Mark loved admiring the strong, fit shape his body was coming to have- Mark looked over at his brother Henry, who was doing about the same. Still sleeping near the window, with that cold night air seeping in from the outside- but like before, it didn't bother Henry a bit. Mark decided now was a good time to continue what he'd been saying. \"Henry,\" Mark said, looking over at the blonde in the dark. \"Yeah?\" \"You gotta play the game, man,\" Mark said seriously. \"You can't go around threatening to cut off kids' balls anymore. That ain't cool, man.\" Henry made a face, then laughed. \"Oh, I'm sorry, Mark. I forgot you gave a shit.\" \"I don't,\" Mark emphasized. \"But people don't like that. Really don't like it. Even rumors about it are bad.\" \"So what?\" Henry laughed. \"It was funny .\" Henry wasn't getting it. \"I'm being serious,\" Mark said. \"You wanna be Creepy Henry all through high school?\" Even in the dark of the room, Mark could see Henry blush. He'd mentioned his childhood nickname before, and confessed his desire to one day be rid of it. The sooner the better, with eighth grade coming up next year and high school after that. \"What- no!\" Henry said, surprised. \"No, I wanna be hot shit in high school, man. I wanna have fun .\" \"Then you've gotta be cool, man,\" Mark said. \"You gotta play the game. You don't have to actually give a shit about any of these guys. Just do what we do with the grown-ups. Act like you care what they think.\" Henry was silent for a few moments, obviously considering that. \"Okay,\" he said, and all traces of humor were gone from his voice. Instead, there was just solemn thoughtfulness, and perhaps also a measure of respect. Henry was listening now. Mark, then, knew he had to take advantage of that. He needed to tutor Henry on this- for both their benefit. \"So,\" Mark said, \"Look at what I do. I say 'what's up' to the guys on the team, the cool kids and all of them. Slap hands, high-five- whatever. Play around with the guys on the team. Fuck around in the locker room, play-fight like you do with me. That sort of thing.\" \"Well,\" Henry said, \"Yeah. I guess that makes sense. So I'm just acting like I care what they have to say?\" \"Exactly.\" \"You should come to me with practice, Mark,\" Henry said suddenly. \"I'm one of the best guys on the team and everybody knows it. I just don't hang out with 'em.\" \"You should,\" Mark said. \"Make some friends. Do any guys at your school smoke?\" Henry laughed. \"Some. Most are fucking posers, though. Just trying to impress people.\" Mark snorted in contempt of such kids as that. Too many teenage boys he knew just smoked once or twice to impress somebody, or in an effort to be popular. He had no time for them. Some boys really did do it for fun, though; because they liked the feel of the nicotine in their system and just plain enjoyed breaking the rules. \"Some do it for fun, right? Some of the cool kids do it?\" \"Yeah,\" Henry said with a shrug. \"So share your cigarettes with them sometime,\" Mark said. \"Offer the guys on the soccer team a couple of cigarettes after practice or a game.\" Henry was silent again, clearly thinking about what Mark was saying. \"I want you to help me,\" he said seriously. \"I need your help here, Mark. A lot of the popular kids still think I'm Creepy Henry.\" \"We'll fix that,\" Mark said solemnly. \"I'll help you, I promise. Some of the kids at school already think I'm cool. They like me.\" Henry grunted in reluctant acknowledgement; his chagrin over his lack of popularity was not at all helped by the fact that Mark had arrived at school just this week and was already making a decent-sized splash in the social pool. \"Well, they do , don't they?\" Mark asked gently. \"Yeah,\" Henry said. \"Well,\" Mark said simply, \"I'm gonna make friends, and you'll move up with me. I'll make sure you do, and you'll learn. We'll do it together.\" \"All right,\" Henry said, sounding like he wanted to believe Mark but was reluctant to risk it. \"Listen,\" Mark said quietly. \"You're my brother, Henry. Just repeat after me.\" Henry was silent. Listening. \"I am Henry.\" \"I am Henry,\" the blonde repeated. \"I will be a fucking badass,\" Mark said. \"I will be a fucking badass,\" Henry repeated, laughing a little at Mark's choice of words. He still had a hard time believing how often he heard Mark swear these days. Mark just grinned up at the ceiling, happy and content like he'd never been in his years. Good times lay ahead; he was sure of it. So what if Henry wasn't such a cool kid right now? He had all the makeup to be one. He was good-looking, strong, a gifted athlete. Henry was a rich kid with good looks and steadily-growing muscles- what else did he need to worry about? And Mark knew of an especially good counter to almost every pitfall that might be found on the way to redeeming Henry's reputation. If one of the cool kids called him \"Creepy Henry,\" Henry could just retort with a decidedly unflattering rumor about them. Everybody had embarrassing moments or secrets. And some didn't even need to be real. Between guys, for example, Mark understood suggesting that a given boy had a tiny penis was always a great insult or comeback. It set him on the defensive, and would hit especially hard if it was at all true. And Henry was a great soccer player- it was something Henry often talked about, and he had no reason to lie to Mark. All Henry needed to do, really, was just be one of the guys. He needed to start being a team player for real- not just using his abilities for his own glory, but making it something that benefited the whole team. If he began to do that, started treating his teammates like buddies and having Mark do the same alongside him- how could the guys and girls at school not change their opinion of him, given a little time? \"Henry,\" Mark said with a smile on his face, \"Together, we're gonna change the world, man.\" Henry didn't say anything. He just smiled.[Chapter 18] Chapter XVIII- The Closed Circle It was a cool day out, Mark's second Saturday in Maine. It wasn't nearly as bad as he remembered December as being, but plenty cold enough. Both boys wore their tan coats, leather gloves- tan for Henry, black for Mark- and wool caps. But that was all really just for appearances; neither one of them much noticed the cold, or cared. They made the necessary excuses before noon and headed out just after lunch; both Mark and Henry wanted a whole afternoon to themselves before they needed to be back in time for dinner. They briefly stopped by the old cemetery on the hill, going by the well and laughing as they remembered how spooked Mark had been when Henry had shot the dog. \"You were such a dork then, man,\" Henry laughed. \"Glad you managed to man up.\" Mark laughed along with Henry, but shook his head in disbelief; Mark could hardly believe he'd once been so timid as he had been last December. \"Yeah,\" Mark said. \"Me, too.\" Henry gave him a look as they stood beside the well. \"How do you feel about it now?\" The auburn-haired boy just shrugged. \"It was just a dog.\" The blonde smiled; he was very pleased. \"Good answer, Mark,\" Henry said. Reaching inside the well and pulling out a tin box from one of the missing bricks, Henry opened it up to reveal two packs of cigarettes and a lighter- the very same, in fact, from several months ago. Henry promptly opened one pack and plucked out a cigarette, lighting it and taking a deep drag. \"Go on,\" Henry said, certain Mark would remember this moment from last December. And sure enough, the auburn-haired boy put on a look of unease, looking hesitantly at the lit cigarette. \"They give you cancer.\" Henry shrugged, enjoying the moment immensely but remembering to keep with the reenactment. \"So what?\" Henry said, \"You're gonna die anyway.\" \"Yeah,\" Mark said, dropping the act and plucking the cigarette from Henry's fingers. \"But not before somebody else does.\" He took a deep drag on the cigarette as Henry lit another for himself. Mark held in the smoke for a moment, then exhaled, breathing it out into the wind. Henry did the same, and for a few minutes the two boys smoked their cigarettes in silence, remembering all the events and changes of the months since December 1993, and feeling a sense of real gratitude that things had worked out so well. It had taken a lot of patience, a lot of planning and hard work- but things had come right in the end. Well, right for Henry and his brother Mark- and who else mattered but them? Finally, Henry tossed his cigarette down into the well; just like last time, Mark could neither see nor hear it when it hit the water down below. \"Come on, Mark,\" Henry said, putting away the tinned box and starting off for the road again. \"We got places to go.\" Mark tossed his cigarette down into the well too; he felt so damn cool when he had one of those, but knew it was time to get going. Time with Henry around was never wasted. As they commenced the long walk across town, heading for the hills and within them Fleetwood Hall, Mark found he was actually looking forward to this. He could distantly remember what it had been like last time he was here, listening to Henry talk about that creepy old mansion and the truly bizarre history it had experienced. His feeling about going all this way to see the place, let alone go inside it, had not been a particularly good one. Overall, back then Mark had felt like he was doing it against his better judgment. But now? Mark wanted to hurry up and get there. He wanted to see this old house again; it was just so fascinating to think about talk about. A vast, unimaginably expensive mansion, unchanged by time and untouched by whoever it was happened to own it these days. It sounded like something out of a fairytale; if the Wicked Witch of the West or the Queen of the Snow White story could have designed a mansion at the start of the 20th century, it would have looked very much like Fleetwood Hall. Henry and Mark talked easily as they made their way along the side of various roads, scurrying up over the side of big drifts of snow thrown aside by the plows as larger trucks passed from time to time. Mark told Henry all about his many exploits in Arizona over the past few months; Henry could only be impressed as he listened to his cousin retell so many stories and happenings, as if for the first time. And it was, in a way- hearing these tales from Mark firsthand was somehow very different from hearing them over the phone. It made sense; friendship by correspondence was simply not possible. You had to invest real time, real effort in it- and most importantly, you just needed to see the person once in a while. Even the best of friendships tended to fade without that. The blonde-haired of the two Evans brothers laughed a little as Mark retold his win in a fistfight against Sean Walters, and then later against Alan Parks. Hearing the way Mark had beaten Alan up and then taken his lunch money- the classic move of any schoolyard bully- Henry just chuckled. \"What? What's so funny?\" Mark asked, curious. He giggled a little himself, though; remembering how he'd made both of those sissies crawl and cry like girls was pretty funny. \" You , dork,\" Henry smirked, affectionately shoving his brother into a snowbank. Mark yelped in surprise and toppled over, then jumped up and snatched Henry's lighter out of his coat pocket. This was Henry's nice lighter, the one he carried with him just about everywhere. \"My Zippo!\" Henry wailed, acting like a boy in great distress. Mark chuckled, acting like he was going to throw the lighter- opened- into a snowbank and ruin it. But instead, glaring at a motorist or two who was giving them some strange looks as they drove by, Mark snapped the gold-plated lighter shut and tossed it back to Henry. \"Come on,\" he said, \"What was funny just then?\" As they resumed walking, Henry just shrugged a little. \"Hey, I just don't get it, man. You tell me it's not kosher to threaten to remove some dork's special parts once in a while- and then go around beating guys up like it's nothing. How's that make sense, dude?\" \"It makes sense,\" Mark said, \"because Sean Walters was a bully and he's fair game. And Alan Parks is a loser . Also fair game. But you can't go holding a knife to his balls and threatening to cut 'em off. I mean, come on, man. That's going a little far.\" Henry laughed. \"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.\" Mark tried to glare at his friend and brother for a few moments, having noticed the almost mocking tone of voice Henry spoke those words in. Mark knew what his brother was referring to; his own killing of his brother Richard, and to Mark's equally cold-blooded act in removing his father from the picture so the brothers could be together again. But before long Mark gave up trying to be mad at Henry. He just couldn't seem to do it. \"Just don't do something like that unless you're gonna kill him afterwards,\" Mark advised. \"And then you just make him disappear, or say it was an accident. Whatever.\" \"Accidents happen,\" Henry said, nodding, then at the same time the two boys said, \"Just ask my mom about Richard.\" Now it was Henry's turn to feign anger, an act which just made Mark laugh more. \"Wiseass,\" Henry said, glaring and attempting to look displeased. Mark just kept chuckling, though, and the blonde gave it up. \"Man, whatever. If I really want to, I'll cut some loser's balls off, and then I'll kill him.\" \"You fuckin' psycho,\" Mark laughed, shaking his head. \"Well, excuse me,\" Henry said with great sarcasm. \"You haven't exactly been a good Christian yourself.\" Mark made a face like he'd eaten something that disagreed with him. He shook his head disdainfully. \"Re ligion . If there was a God, Henry, he'd have stopped us by now.\" Henry shrugged. \"That or he's as crazy as we are.\" The auburn-haired boy looked at his brother as they walked, a little displeased. \"Oh, so we're crazy?\" Henry just shook his head. \"No, I mean by 'normal' standards.\" Mark huffed in disdain for such people. \"Dorks.\" \"Losers,\" Henry said, nodding in agreement. After a few moments of silence, Mark thought of something else. \"What about free will? Like, what if God lets people do whatever they want? Make their own choices?\" That actually made a lot of sense to Mark, now that he thought about it. When hadn't his decisions since last December been his own? Henry shrugged. \"Then there's no problem. Is there?\" They walked on, gradually entering the hills where Rockbridge's finest mansions could be found. After another ten minutes, the towering Gothic architecture of the imperious Fleetwood Hall began to become visible. In just a short minute or two, the boys were standing by the black, wrought-iron front gates. Henry waved invitingly to Mark. \"After you, brother,\" he said. \"Thank you, brother,\" Mark said with equally deliberate courtesy. The two boys smiled at each other briefly; each liked very much the newfound chance to use that word. It was no longer a term they had to keep secret, or avoid using around others despite the fact that 'cousin' had long ago become obsolete. They were brothers. So what if they had been born as cousins, and hadn't even met until they were 12? Nobody was going to bring that up now, not with Mark so clearly enjoying his friendship with Henry. The two boys were supporting each other through their strong bond; anyone could see that. If they saw each other as siblings in full rather than as adopted ones, nobody was gonna say anything against that. So Henry and Mark were brothers, in every sense that mattered. Mark ducked down and crawled under the gates. They were locked as always, but that posed no real problem. The two boys were slim and had lean, athletic builds- the progress they had made on improving them in the past months was a source of real pride for both of them. Henry slipped under the gates just moments after Mark, who was looking at the house, fascinated. Those darkened windows- somehow, they didn't look empty. \"I feel like it's looking at us,\" Mark said faintly. \"It is,\" Henry said from beside him. \"It is, Mark.\" Mark wanted to go inside. Suddenly, he really, really wanted to go inside that towering house. It wasn't just a simple whim or want; it was a pull somewhere inside Mark, a longing he couldn't describe in words. Mark didn't feel like he was going to some dusty old mansion, some creepy old place where he was just gonna end up frightened and lost. Mark felt like he was coming home. The boys walked across the icy, leaf-strewn front drive and up to the big double doors that guarded the entrance to Fleetwood Hall. This time when Henry stepped up to set a hand on one brass doorknob, Mark held out an arm. He wanted to do this. The auburn-haired boy gripped the old, ornate brass doorknob and closed his eyes, just as he'd seen Henry do the last time they were here. Abruptly- just as Henry had done- Mark felt himself seize up, and he trembled slightly as he stood there, concentrating on a single thought. Or rather two thoughts, similar and close together. I am safe here , Mark thought. I am home . Briefly Mark could have sworn something else was in his head; a cool, emotionless presence. If it was there at all, it was examining Mark- perhaps deciding if he was to be admitted as a guest or let in to be eaten as food. The thought surprised Mark, but it made sense. Henry had explained in detail how people tended to disappear in Fleetwood Hall- the house had a liking, it seemed, for feeding off death. Mark briefly made a note of this as he stood with his hand gripping the doorknob; perhaps the next time either of the brothers killed somebody, they could move the body here and leave it. The house, Mark sensed, would better appreciate a living body that died within its grounds- better food. Fresher that way. But dead was dead- and the Hall would remember its faithful. \"Ah!\" Mark gasped suddenly; he had apparently forgotten to breathe in the time he'd been holding the door. His wrist jerked left as if by instinct, and the door swung inward and opened easily. Henry was looking at Mark curiously. \"You all right, Mark?\" Mark nodded, quite sure. He felt very well indeed. \"Yeah, man. I feel great.\" He looked around, grinning as he surveyed the cavernous entrance hall as they walked in. \"I like this place. Feel at home here. You know?\" Henry nodded. \"Yeah. Sure do.\" The boys hung up their coats in a closet the size of some lesser houses' bedrooms, talking easily all the while. They headed back out into the grand entrance hall, heading for the gigantic, polished hardwood staircase. The two boys climbed the stairs, chatting amicably. \"Oh, Mark,\" Henry said, \"I heard Mom and Dad talking in the kitchen the other day. They mentioned Alice Davenport. Said it might be good if you had a little therapy. See if you're okay.\" Mark made a face, looking like his stomach was giving me trouble. \"Don't mention that old fart to me, man.\" \"Well,\" Henry said with a sly smile, \"I know how much you like talking to her.\" \"She doesn't believe in 'evil',\" Mark said savagely. \"Maybe I'll show her sometime.\" \"Accidents happen,\" Henry said with a grin. Mark looked at his brother, nodding as he understood, thinking about it a little. Accidents happen, all right. Maybe she'll have one herself soon, that Davenport woman. Maybe she'll figure out evil has many faces- some, even, are the faces of angels. But not the good kind. Not the nice ones . As they walked down the Corridor, heading along its vast length and admiring the fine wallpaper, carpeting, and many paintings on the walls, Henry and Mark each talked about their growing athletic prowess, bragging about how many pushups each one of them could do without stopping. \"You've done great the last couple months, Mark,\" Henry said with a smile. \"Just think what it's gonna be like when we're in high school. All the weight we'll be able to lift!\" Mark laughed, smiling as he thought about it. \"Man, I'm gonna sc- fuck a girl every Friday,\" he bragged. \"A different girl.\" Henry laughed, too, giving Mark a shove. \"Now you're dreaming , dude.\" Mark shoved him back. \"Who got to first base first?\" The blonde ducked his head and headbutted his brother; the two fell to the floor, punching and kicking and immediately engaging in a wrestling match. Henry was immediately surprised only at how strong Mark was, but at how both boys seemed to go at each other with everything they had, fighting playfully but fiercely by instinct. They were like lion cubs; not the big-shots in town yet, but well on their way- and even play-fighting was a time to prepare them for the real thing. Mark was a strong boy; he rolled on top of Henry once and gave him an affectionate punch in the mouth; Henry tasted copper and twisted fiercely, forcing Mark off him. This was insane! Henry's theory that the mansion had benefits for those strong enough to deserve them was definitely proving itself correct. Mark, it would seem, had gained quite a hefty boost on all fronts when Fleetwood Hall rewrote his mind. The auburn-haired boy wasn't just simply the old Mark with more spine; for once, for the first time in his life, Henry had met someone who was on every front his equal. Mark was as mean as Henry; he'd proved that when he burned down his own house, knowing perfectly well it would kill his father. He also no longer gave a shit that Henry had drowned his younger brother Richard, or about that dog Henry had killed. Mark had always been smart, but now he seemed to not only be able to follow Henry's complex, devious thinking but do plenty of it on his own. And Mark was in damn good shape these days. Henry, never a weak boy, had been working out steadily since his tenth birthday, and with his thirteenth coming up in August he'd really been stepping up his game. He'd been taking karate lessons for two years before Mark ever even considered starting, and yet here they were, battling it out in the Corridor as equals. After perhaps a minute or two, the boys battled each other to an impasse and suddenly halted, panting and sweaty. \"Truce?\" Henry asked, and Mark nodded. \"Truce.\" They got up and brushed each other off, heading on down the hall as if nothing had even happened. \"Mark?\" Henry said, speaking softly as they walked through the silent mansion. \"Yeah?\" Mark said, walking beside him. Mark couldn't understand his vague memory of being fearful, hesitant and ill-at-ease when he'd first come here last December. This house was amazing! It had everything he could want, the accommodations of a man so wealthy he could have shamed the King himself with his grandeur. Preston Whitmore's spirit had not been quite so enduring as his wife's, but he had done plenty well for himself. This house was the Versailles of Maine. It was abandoned, forgotten- but not decaying, and not dead. Just… sleeping. Why had Mark been so afraid to come here a year ago? He couldn't understand it. He couldn't make sense of any of his memories from last December and before. Why had he been friends with Alan Parks, for instance? Ever? Why had he put up with that dork Wesley and his stupid jokes, or that asshole Sean Walters and his short-sighted, pointlessly cruel bullying schemes? Mark didn't get it. It seemed, from his own memory and everyone else's- even Henry's, though he didn't mention it much- that prior to some point in December 1993, Mark Evans had been a timid, morally-righteous dweeb. A goody two-shoes who didn't like working out, never tried to visualize playing 'hide the sausage' with Megan Baker and- speaking of that- was probably not getting laid until college. At least. Where had this old Mark come from, and where had he gone? How had the new one come into being, and why? Not that Mark was complaining of course. He didn't just like who he was now; he loved it. He was an outstanding athlete, climbing a little higher on the social ladder every day. He was cool, confident, and in absolute control of himself and his life at all times. Never had Mark felt so good about who he was, or where his life was going. No, he didn't want to know why things had changed so he could go back and revert to who he'd been. Mark just wanted to know who was responsible for this change so he could thank them. Speaking of which, the most likely suspect was beside Mark right now, speaking with a small smile on his face as he threw an arm around Mark's shoulder. The two were dressed almost identically; Henry wore a ruby-red sweater, Mark a midnight blue. Both wore gray German wool pants, perfect for use in the winter. And their jackets, of course, were velvety tan fabric lined on the inside with fur. \"I'm glad we became friends,\" Henry said, and the hint of powerful emotion in his voice told Mark right away his brother was telling the truth. Henry was very honest with Mark, even if he lied impulsively to everyone else. It was a trait Mark was glad to mimic perfectly. \"Me, too,\" Mark said, reaching up and messing with Henry's nice cut of blonde hair. \"Hey, hey!\" Henry fussed, frowning. \"Watch the hair, man. The babes like my hair.\" Mark just laughed. \"Femboy.\" \"Faggot.\" A shoving match erupted then and the two almost began a second wrestling match, but just then Mark noticed a familiar door on their right. He knew which one it was because of that painting of a Duesenberg SJ they'd just passed on the right. That was where some switch or fusebox was, sitting behind the painting. As Henry by habit went to flip on the box- for some reason that almost seemed like a formality, since the gas or electric or whatever should have been off long ago- Mark headed for the door to the stairs. He turned to look at Henry as he set his hand on the door and began to open it; Mark had to fight back laughter at Henry's look of absolute astonishment. \"How-how'd you know that?\" Henry said, looking absolutely floored. \"You were lost as shit last time!\" Mark just snickered. \"Oh, a lot's changed since last time, Henry. More than you can imagine.\" Was that a flicker of fear he saw cross Henry's face? But Mark just took a step forward and hugged his brother a little. \"Come on, dork,\" he said affectionately. \"Let's climb some stairs.\" Seeing the genuine look of liking on Mark's face- it was such a relief, even now, to see that instead of Mark's constant fearfulness or suspicion of old- Henry relaxed. It sometimes took a little effort, a slight reminder, to remember Mark wasn't that self-righteous idiot he'd been last December. He was a new man now- aggressive, confident, and apparently right at home in Fleetwood Hall. His cruel, icy cunning was no threat to Henry- far from it. Mark's cruelty and anger were reserved for the foolish, the unlucky, and the weak. Henry was not only none of those things; he was Mark's brother. Mark would always be on his side. I gotta tell him what I did . The thought came out of nowhere- Henry had never had one like it before. But somehow, as the two boys began to climb the stairwell that led up to the third floor, Henry knew it made sense. Mark was a good friend to him, a brother. He deserved to be told the truth, even about the one thing Henry had sworn- as of last December- he would never tell Mark. He'd been afraid of losing what he'd gained. That if he told Mark what he did to him- what he gave Fleetwood Hall a chance to do- the old Mark would somehow come back. Henry would be forced to fight his brother, his friend- maybe even kill him. And then he'd be alone. But Henry owed his brother the truth. They climbed the stairs easily, the trek posing no physical challenge to either boy. They were some of the strongest 7th graders anywhere in their school, and with a full soccer season coming up in the fall, coupled with all those workouts they had to look forward to, Henry and Mark had every reason to expect to enter high school wearing muscle shirts, showing off the results of their hard work. Henry fretted a little about what he was gonna say to Mark, and how. At a few moments he worried more than a little. But as the two headed upstairs, climbing a stairwell lined with rich, dark wood paneling and elegant wallpaper- lit by gas lights Henry had somehow forgotten to turn on the last time- Henry told himself not to worry. Any conflict that might come up between the brothers as a result of Henry telling Mark about the house, about what he'd done and the change it had forced in Mark, would have happened anyway. It was better to get it over with now, with the house to back him up. Hopefully. \"Hey, man,\" Mark said, poking his brother in his left side. \"I got an idea for ya.\" \"What's that?\" Henry asked as they reached the third floor landing and Mark- who again had known to stop here- headed to the door and opened it. He wasn't even fooled by the real door that stood immobile against a blank wall, one of a number of false doors that Great Aunt Eleanor had greatly enjoyed designing. Instead, Mark went for the blank stretch of wallpaper on the opposite side of the landing, crossing the stairs and finding the little space of wall you had to press to make the real door reveal itself. As Mark did, and the door swung open to reveal another long, dimly-lit hallway, he answered his brother easily. \"You and me are gonna be friends with John.\" \"What? John La Fleur ?\" Henry asked, incredulous. \"Dude- you sure you're talking about the right guy ? Last karate lesson I kicked his ass into the middle of next week !\" \"I'm talking about the right guy,\" Mark said as they started down the hallway, the door- on this side a perfectly normal door, though in this house \"normal door\" meant hand-carved oak, pine or mahogany- swinging shut behind them. \"Look, he's an okay kid, isn't he?\" \"He's not weak,\" Henry said, thinking about it. \"But you still don't get it, dude. He ain't gonna want to be friends with me after I kicked him like that.\" \"Well,\" Mark said simply, \"I'll talk to him first, then. You remember those tests you put me through, back when we first met?\" \"Yeah,\" Henry said. He was hoping Mark didn't remember too much from those days… But Mark just went on, \"That's what I'm talking about, man. I'll just say he passed your test. Something like, 'My brother wanted to see if you were man enough to take a full-force kick and not tell Sensei about it, like a little girl. You did great'.\" Mark considered. \"I'll even tell him about the night we met-\" \" Gay ,\" Henry droned, and giggled like a kid at Mark's momentary irritation. \"I'll tell him about the night we first met,\" Mark went on with some effort. \"How you kicked me in the shin under the table, to see if I had what it took to be your friend.\" Henry was silent for a few moments as they walked down the hallway, heading for the entrance to the Glass Library, at the end of the long hallway- Fleetwood Hall had a lot of those- and just around the corner. \"That might work,\" he said. Then he smiled, throwing an arm around Mark's steadily-growing shoulders and ruffling his hair, just as Mark had recently done to him. \"That's why you're my brother.\" \"Just think about it, man,\" Mark said, trying to hide how pleased he was that Henry liked the plan. \"LaFleur's on the soccer team with you, right?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Think of him as your first real teammate. He'll be the first friend you make in school, and from him there'll be others. I'll be on the team in the fall, too. You and me will help him with soccer, help him with karate- he'll be so glad he met us.\" Henry just smiled, repeating his earlier words. \"That's why you're my brother.\" The Glass Library was huge, cavernous; as big as Mark was getting to be, it nevertheless made him feel small again. But not in a bad way. Nothing like that. Instead, Mark felt like the deeper he went in this giant house, the safer he was. The domed ceiling still stood arched high above, that priceless English chandelier hanging down from the exact center of it, casting a brilliant glow all over the room. The circular shape of the room, which had to have a diameter of at least five hundred feet across, was just amazing. Naturally-dark green glass bookshelves lined the walls, holding hundreds if not thousands of books. The wide-open empty space of the floor was mirror glass; Mark looked down and saw a perfect reflection of his own image, and Henry's beside him. The glass was flawless, perfect- like it had been cleaned two minutes ago instead of having lain essentially untouched for decades. Some parts of the house appeared dusty, preserved but in some ways aged. Not here, though. Not the Glass Library. Much of the house as a whole was perhaps resting, waiting for better, more vibrant times again. But the Glass Library was alive. \"Houses are alive, you know,\" Henry said reflectively, his voice taking on a strange, distant tone. \"Everybody knows it. It's news from our nerves.\" Mark just looked at his brother, too intrigued at the moment to interrupt him. Henry wandered slowly into the room, gazing up at the dome, the chandelier- looking around. The room was utterly silent. For just a moment, Mark was sure he heard the faintest whispers out in the hallway- like a phantom draft had somehow learned to talk. \"If we're quiet, Mark,\" Henry said softly, \"we can hear houses breathe. In the middle of the night, if you listen- you can hear them groan sometimes. Some houses hate normal people. Blindly hate our so-called 'humanity'. Only for a few can a place like that be called home.\" Henry turned to his brother, an odd gleam in his eyes. \"This house is home for us, Mark.\" Mark was fascinated. He was welcome here; he could feel it. He knew the history of Fleetwood Hall as well as Henry; this place had a blind, all-consuming hate for humanity that made it dangerous like no other place on Earth. In a normal mansion, the worst you could get was lost. In a haunted place, mansion or not, the commonplace disbelief in ghosts and supernatural things would serve you well, acting as a sort of protection. But not here. The auburn-haired boy could sense something about this house. It wasn't 'haunted' in any normal, cheap-horror-movie sense of the word. There was something very different here. But whatever it was, it didn't hate Mark. Or Henry. They were okay. They were strong enough to deserve the Hall's accepting their presence. Perhaps even embracing it. \"This house is alive, Mark,\" Henry said, his eyes bright with that strange, dancing light. He had spent years piecing together the knowledge he held now, taken months trying things out, experimenting- and now he was sure. \"You mean, it knows we're here? Like that?\" Mark asked, so fascinated he could barely remember his words. \"Sure it does,\" Henry nodded. \"It likes us, Mark. It likes you.\" Henry sat down on the floor, propping himself up on his hands as he leaned back. He reached over and patted some mirror glass beside him. \"Have a seat, Mark,\" he said, smiling warmly. \"Thanks,\" Mark smiled back, sitting down and leaning back with his hands propped up behind him. \"So, Mark,\" Henry said warmly, \"Did I ever tell you how I went under the floor a while back? When I was eleven?\" \"No,\" Mark shook his head. \"Well,\" Henry began, \"I didn't do it right off. When I was ten, I took a nap in the Grand Library once.\" \"That's the big one, down on the second floor,\" Mark said. \"Sure is, Mark,\" Henry nodded, again surprised at Mark's apparent knowledge of the house. \"I fell asleep in this really nice chair. Just a couple of minutes. I felt great when I woke up- I'd had a cough and all that, but it was gone the next day. So I went back again, and this one time after that I slept in one of the master bedrooms.\" Henry smiled at the memory. \"It worked really well. Somehow, Mark, I just felt even better. Like I wasn't wasting time on, you know, that weakness. That need to sleep. I felt like that nap- just an hour or two- helped me a lot. So I tried something else- a third test. This time I went all the way up here. Just thought, why not? I'll just sleep on the floor of the only library in the world with a floor of mirror-glass.\" Henry smiled a little. \"Who gets to do that, right?\" \"Only us,\" Mark smiled back. \"So I did,\" Henry continued. \"I just walked in here, looked around for a little while.\" Henry glanced up. \"Looked at that awesome chandelier.\" The blonde thought for a moment. \"Well, what I did was, I just lay down, like this.\" He lay flat on his back, calm and relaxed as you please. Mark looked down at him, mesmerized. Henry went on, \"I wasn't sure what happened, at first. I was even a little scared. But after a few minutes of me lying there, relaxed, my eyes closed… something happened. I went somewhere, Mark. And for a while, it was like I was in the house. Like it was in me. And I felt… good.\" Henry smiled wistfully, reliving the sweet memory of that awesome discovery. \"I felt strong.\" Looking at his brother, Henry had an expression of real seriousness- real intent. \"I'm sure about something, Mark. This house can help us. It can make us smart, make us strong- I think it even cleans out our lungs.\" Henry shrugged a little. \"How do you think we can go on lighting up a pack whenever we want?\" Then he grinned. \"Or packing on all that muscle like we're doing?\" Mark paused. This was… amazing . Like nothing he'd ever heard in his life. Had it been anyone else, Mark would have kicked them in the nuts for wasting his time with such a crazy story. But this wasn't anybody else; this was Henry. This was his friend. \"So,\" Mark said slowly, \"Fleetwood Hall can help us? Physically, mentally? That kinda thing?\" Henry nodded. \"Well,\" Mark began, \"What happens with the floor?\" \"You gotta lie on your back, Mark,\" Henry said, still doing so himself. \"You gotta relax, close your eyes- don't worry about anything. This floor isn't always solid.\" Henry added those last words with a sly smile, like he was sharing some secret just for the two of them. \"So…\" Mark said as he began to get the idea, \"We'll… go under the floor?\" Henry nodded. Suddenly, Mark sat up and looked at his cousin sharply. He'd figured something else out, too. \"Is that what you did with me ?\" Henry sat up too, his blue eyes wide and startled. \"Hey,\" he said carefully, \"don't get mad. I'm just telling you I like to investigate. It's scientific.\" But Mark was having none of that. He stood and grabbed Henry by two fistfuls of his nice, expensive sweater, hand-knitted by some overpaid fashion designer in New Hampshire. Forcing Henry to his feet so fast it made the blonde's head swim, Mark barked a demand in his brother's face. \"Is that why I was such a dork before?\" Mark asked. \"Is that what you did? Put me under the floor so this house could- do something?\" Henry stared back, wide-eyed and clearly afraid to answer. \"You fucking tell me!\" Mark yelled, then calmed a little, lowering his voice just a bit. But his next question was still a demand. \"Did you put me under the floor when we came here last time?\" The blonde stood inches from Mark, his face pulled close to his brother's. Terrified thoughts of losing everything he'd gained ran through Henry's mind. He felt his palms grow sweaty, and for possibly the first time ever felt like he was experiencing real fear. Death, injury, the cops- none of it really mattered. But what if some memory had come back? What if something about coming back here- about Henry revealing what he knew about Fleetwood Hall- had triggered something in Mark? What if the brother he'd worked so hard to gain was about to leave him forever? If that's what he does , Henry vowed silently, I'm gonna hang myself tomorrow . But if that was what needed to be done, Henry would do it. He had never been one to back away from the tasks that had to be accomplished. But for now, he had no way of knowing. Mark could just be demanding an answer so he had the information- and so he had just one more piece of proof that Henry would never lie to him. Or he could be reverting back to his old self. There was no way of knowing, and Henry knew delaying or lying when he gave an answer would only make things worse. \"What if I did?\" Henry asked finally; he noticed a quaver in his voice he'd never heard before. He was truly afraid of what Mark might do- of what might very well happen next. For a few moments, time seemed to stand still. Mark was still gripping to fistfuls of Henry's sweater, and that angry look was still there in his eyes. Henry barely had time to notice before Mark wrapped his arms around his brother, embracing him in a bear-hug so fierce Henry feared for the integrity of his ribs. His breath went out of him in a rush. \"Thank you, man,\" Mark said in a voice quivering with emotion. \"Thank you!\" Henry sighed with relief, surprised he had any air left to do it with. After a moment, he realised that sigh had halfway been a sob. Not a weak or cowardly one- it was a sob of relief. Of joy. \"Glad to help,\" Henry gasped, hugging his brother back. \"I was such a wuss,\" Mark almost sobbed. \"I was so afraid. You saved me.\" \"I'm so glad you're my brother, Mark,\" Henry said as his brother loosened his grip a little, remembering the blonde needed to breathe. \"It means a lot to me.\" Never, ever before in his life had Henry even known how to say that. Now not only could he find the words to say… he wanted to. Finally, the two boys lay down on the floor of the Glass Library, just a foot or two apart and directly parallel to each other. Henry lay on his back, his face up to the domed ceiling and his hands folded over his taut belly. He was developing a bit of a six-pack there. Nothing real impressive, not just yet- but getting there. With some small envy Henry realised Mark was probably farther along. The Hall had been kind to Mark, indeed- and Mark had done plenty of work on his own. Henry closed his eyes, able to hear the sound of Mark breathing quietly beside him. The floor became soft, like water. In just a moment, the two boys slipped underneath. It was hard, the first moment or two after you went under for the first time, not to panic. To instinctively freak out, wondering what the hell just happened- and if you weren't somehow in danger. Henry stayed calm, though, and beside him so did Mark. Henry didn't need to look or anything like that, didn't need to check. He just knew. As he entered that odd, wonderfully pleasant dreamlike state you went into under the mirror-glass floor, Henry felt the most incredible sensation about him. In moments it entered his nostrils, slipping in through his mouth and touching his lungs. It was the cool of a creek in the summer- the refreshing cold without the harshness or oppressive water that could make you drown. It was warm, at the same time- warm without being hot. And cool, without being cold. It was amazing- and Henry could feel how good it was for him, knitting strength and energy into his very bloodstream. It was amazing. And there was something else, too- something Henry had never felt before. There was someone else here- another presence in his mind. And at the same time, Henry felt like he was a presence in theirs. Like the two were… connected. Henry had a feeling who it was. And this time he had no fear- he wouldn't have it any other way. The blonde boy had hated his life, all those years he'd been alone. He hadn't realised it, but had that auburn-haired boy not walked into his life last year, Henry probably would have hung himself on his thirteenth birthday. Dead of boredom- and an utterly empty life. Someone had saved him from that. It was good… to finally have a friend. A brother. Henry had taken so many risks with Mark, gone to so much trouble he never would have even considered doing for anyone else. But he had - because, somehow, Henry had known it would be worth it. There was one more experiment to do for today. One more test to conduct, and Henry was sure he knew what the outcome would be. Reaching out to the other presence, to the other mind he felt nearby him, Henry asked- without speaking a single word- one sentence. You there, Mark ? A familiar voice answered him. Always . Notes: I'd like to give a special thanks to two users here. ComedyMonarchy, for posting that review or two that ultimately encouraged me to finish this story's predecessor, \"The Second Face\", rather than leave it unfinished or scrap it as I'd originally been planning to do. I had gotten hung up on the first story, unsure of how to deal with the issue of 'changing' Mark. He was so different a person he would have never joined Henry willingly. I got stuck on that long enough that I almost abandoned the story completely, but ComedyMonarchy's review made me think twice about scrapping it. I wrote on and so \"The Second Face\" was finished. The story almost ended there. I honestly was pleased at how my alternate version of \"The Good Son\" turned out, but had no ideas for or intention of writing a sequel. Again, a single user on this great website intervened. AM83220 posted a glowing review of \"The Second Face\", telling me in no uncertain terms that the story- and the ideas I'd come up with- had great potential for continuation. I then reconsidered on not writing a sequel. AM83220 acted as my sounding board, proofreader, and helped me immensely in getting through a story I would have probably taken forever to get done by myself. Instead I finished \"The Evil Angel\" in about a month. The Word document of it is 166 pages, the longest document I've ever written. I want to note AM83220 not only as a great help to me in my own writing, and someone who I really cannot thank enough for their help in writing this story. But AM83220 is also a writer on this website, with 6 stories of his own. I just finished reading \"And a Teenager Shall Lead Them\" and it's one of the best pieces of fanfiction I've ever read. My sincerest thanks and compliments to these two users. Without them neither \"The Second Face\" nor \"The Evil Angel\" would ever have been written. On a minor note, by two stories on \"The Good Son\" have both used an alternate title from the film's releases. The 1993 movie \"The Good Son\" was released in several countries besides the United States of America. These included France, Spain, and Germany. In Germany, the movie was titled \"Das Zweite Gesicht\", literally \"The Second Face\". I thought that title quite brilliant, since it no doubt refers to the two faces Henry has to show the world. In Spain, the movie had two titles, apparently. One was \"El Buen Hijo\", simply \"The Good Son\" in Spanish. But another name it had was \"El Malvado Angel\", translating to \"The Evil Angel\". I liked that title enough, too, that I used it as my title for my first follow-up story to the events of the original film. Any story I write after this will very likely be rated M, so keep that in mind. A teenage and later perhaps adult Henry and Mark would most definitely be something that would involve violent and sexual content. There is a lot you can do with a T rating if you're careful, but that would not make sense with a story about two child socio/psychopaths. Lastly, keep in mind that Fleetwood Hall as I depict it has many basic similarities to the Seattle, Washington mansion of Rose Red from the TV miniseries \"Stephen King's Rose Red\". That is the scariest damn haunted house I've ever seen. Some aspects of Fleetwood Hall, however, are entirely original- most notably its almost friendly attitude towards Henry and now Mark. Fleetwood Hall will be a hindrance and even a danger to most people, but that's because it's meaner than hell. If someone were to show up who is just as cold-hearted as the house, it doesn't mind as much. Plus, remember I noted that Mark and Henry are relatives of the Whitmore family- and in particular Helen Whitmore, for whom the house was built. Like Rose Red, Fleetwood Hall is always more welcoming to those it regards as family. Lastly, understand some things about the changes in Henry and Mark. Henry, being a born sociopath, has grown up incapable of understanding normal human emotions. Things like love, sorrow and regret are alien emotions to him, and the thrill of danger and selfish acts that bring him pleasure are some of the only things Henry truly feels. His early explorations in Fleetwood Hall only benefit him, as the house poses no threat to someone as cold and mean as Henry. The house can put some of its evil directly into Henry, because he's as mean as the Hall is. But Mark, being the true \"good son\" of the original story, never could have been corrupted that way. To change Mark and make him more like Henry, altering his emotional and mental state to make him incapable of feeling remorse or guilt and having a similar disposition to his cousin, Fleetwood Hall had to do an exchange. It took some of Mark's soul and placed it in Henry, and put some of Henry in Mark. The ultimate goal was to change Mark, and this was successful. But the house inadvertently changed Henry, too- he can now feel many of the same emotions Mark can. In some ways, his emotional blankness of the past has been fixed, but in a very limited way- he only feels any real concern or liking for Mark. ","Summary":" Chapter I- Brothers Parting It was 3:55 in the afternoon; Mark Evans was supposed to have left his "},{"Movie":"Good Son","Title":"Something About Mark","Author":"phorosz","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10183550","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: I'm certain that I'm not the first person to think of this (e.g., a complete role reversal for Mark and Henry), but here it is nonetheless: Chapter 1 - Mom December 1, 1993 For an instant, one circle eclipsed another. One was a fluorescent light that hung from the ceiling of the gym, the other an orange and black basketball. Twelve year-old Henry Evans caught his breath and positioned himself beneath the one that was falling. It landed in his outstretched hands with a dull smack. \"Go! Go! Go!\" \"Defense! Defense!\" \"Score!\" The shouts and cheers were coming from everywhere. They came from the bleachers, where well over a hundred parents, teachers, and fellow students watched, some standing stock-still, others – like the cheerleading squad – jumping up and down with great enthusiasm. They also came from Henry's teammates of Rock Harbor Middle School, now spread out beside him as he began to dribble the ball across the court. And they came from the opposing players – out of Biloxi Junior High in West Florida – yelling at each other to get into position. Of average height and well-built for his age, Henry was athletic and an able basketball player, so dribbling the ball was almost like second nature to him. His eyes scanned the court ahead, looking for a teammate to pass to or a foe to fake around. Two kids from the opposing team were now closing in on him, and Henry deftly passed the ball to his left. Dylan Connors, one of Henry's best friends and his team's small forward, caught it, faked around an opponent, and passed it back to him. As he dribbled across the midcourt line, Henry could see teammates to his right and left, and two nervous guards from the other team backing up. He knew a good clean basket when he saw it. He could almost see the ball sailing through the air and dropping through the net... But then a ref's whistle suddenly blew, halting the game. Henry stopped, puzzled, and ran his fingers through his sweat-soaked and badly tousled shaggy blond hair. He was certain his team wasn't offside, and hadn't seen anyone from his team commit a foul, either. Henry instinctively looked toward the bleachers. There, he saw something that made him freeze: his father on the sideline, holding his jacket and blue gym bag, his younger brother and sister standing beside him. Coach Mason was waving for him to come off the court. Eli Matheson would be substituting for him. Henry knew well the reason he was being taken out of the game had absolutely nothing to do with sports. It was his mother. For a time back in the game, he'd managed not to think about her. But now the thought sent a cold shiver down his spine, despite the stuffy atmosphere in the gym. He started to jog slowly off the court. And as Eli walked by, he patted Henry sympathetically on the shoulder, a solemn look on his face. \"Sorry, man.\" Everyone at school – and almost everybody in town for that matter – knew about his mother. Henry reached the sidelines. He was only half-aware of Coach Mason telling him he'd played a good game. Meanwhile, his father stepped toward him, holding out the gym bag and his jacket, while his sister, six year-old Connie, silently stood back with their little brother, four year-old Richard. Richard often reminded Henry of himself at that age. \"It's not...\" Henry couldn't get the words out. It couldn't be the end. Not yet... \"No.\" Wallace Evans shook his head. Wallace was a handsome man of above-average height in his early forties, with wavy blond hair that he normally combed back. He was wearing a light brown suit jacket and khaki pants that were slightly wrinkled at the knees and elbows. \"Then why?\" Henry asked as he slipped on his jacket. \"Dr. Callaghan thinks it might be soon,\" Wallace answered. \"He said you guys should come now.\" They started out of the gym and down the hall toward the exit. A loud blaring and then a dull roar went up from the gym behind them, but Henry didn't even consider turning around. Henry shivered as they stepped out into the parking lot. He was still wearing his basketball uniform, which was hardly conducive to warmth in the thirty-degree winter air of coastal Maine. They stopped to either side of the family car, an early model blue Ford Taurus with lightly faded paint. \"You aren't going to call the rest of the family now, are you?\" Henry asked as he opened the back door for Connie and Richard. Their father was quiet for a moment. Then he responded. \"Yes, Henry. I am,\" he said in a halting voice. So this was it. As he got in and buckled his seatbelt, Henry felt a pang of emotion deep within himself. His father had once told him that he wouldn't call anyone until the end was truly upon them. Ever since then, it had been that one question Henry had always asked. Wallace gunned the engine and drove from the parking lot. As long as anyone hadn't been called, there was hope. The hospital was of late post-war construction and had the overall color of dull gray concrete intermixed with red brick. It was surrounded by a few small gardens of gravel, pine and maple trees, and assorted bushes. Henry nervously counted the seconds that ticked by before the elevator came to a stop at their all-too frequent destination on the fourth floor. As they set out down the long corridor, the late afternoon sun sent yellow shafts of light through the window blinds and open doorways. The sun, as it always did at this time of year, seemed to be in a hurry to turn a fiery red and disappear behind the mountains and hills to the west. The hall smelled of medicine. Henry's heart beat a touch faster and he experienced the mixture of dread and longing he always felt when they came to the hospital. Ahead was his mother's private room, and as they approached, Dr. John Callaghan, wearing a set of green-blue scrubs and stethoscope, stepped out. The gray-haired older man looked over his bifocals at the approaching family. Sometimes in the past, he'd smiled when he saw them coming. Today he did not. Callaghan met them outside the room. \"Can we go in?\" Wallace asked. \"She's asleep,\" Callaghan said. He glanced quickly at Henry, Connie, and Richard. \"But I think this might be a good time for them to see her.\" \"Thanks, John,\" Wallace said. He and the kids started toward the doorway, but Callaghan put a hand on Wallace's shoulder. \"Wallace, could you stay out here a moment? There are a few things I think we should speak about.\" Now without their father, the children hesitated by the door. But Wallace Evans nodded slightly, letting Henry know that they should go ahead. Henry led his siblings into the dimly-lit room. The lights were off and the shade had been pulled down, allowing only a narrow shaft of yellow-red sunlight in. Susan Evans lay propped up by several pillows, her badly fatigued, shadow-ringed eyes closed and her mouth slightly agape. A nasal cannula ran from a tank of oxygen into her nostrils, while a rack with several semi-transparent bags of multi-colored IV solution hung off to one side of the bed and fed down through a long tube into the back of her hand. Henry felt a sensation of despair and Connie squeezed his hand. Their mother no longer possessed the aura of energy that had so long sustained her through life. He could all too easily remember the day that she'd told them what was happening to her. \"It's cancer,\" Susan said, her face a mix of emotion. Henry stifled a gasp and choked back tears in that moment, while Wallace did his best to keep a cool and level head about the news. Connie and Richard were still frightened as well, but, for the moment, were blissfully ignorant of the meaning of their mother's words. \"What do the doctors say, Sus?\" Wallace asked. \"They – they say it's inoperable, even by NCD standards.\" Wallace looked like he had taken a stab to the heart. \"Are they certain?\" Susan nodded solemnly in reply. \"Have – have they given...\" Wallace stuttered, barely able to form his own words. \"They're not entirely certain, but their best guess is six to seven months.\" It was at that moment Henry finally let the tears out and ran over to hug his mother. He hugged her tight and didn't want to ever let go. It wasn't long before Connie and Richard joined him. \"Oh, kids... I – I love you, too,\" Susan said, her voice quavering as tears began to spill from her eyes. Before now, Henry and his siblings had never doubted that their mother would somehow get better, but even though they had seen her in this worn-out condition several times, neither Henry nor Connie still couldn't bring themselves to believe it. Richard, young though he was, now reluctantly understood what was happening. Their mother was really dying. Connie and Richard sat in chairs beside the bed, while Henry dropped into a worn leather sofa in the corner. Out of a sense of pure curiosity and near-impossible hope, he glanced around at the equipment and the things on her night table, as if there might be something there that would indicate her condition was actually improving despite the grim look on Dr. Callaghan's face. But nothing was different. All the equipment necessary to keep their mother alive was still there. The vase of roses Connie had specially picked out was still on the night table, only the roses had started to wilt. Next to them was a photograph in a silver frame. It was a photograph of their mother in a long green dress, a broad smile on her face, walking with the three of them through a grove of dogwood trees in full bloom. It seemed almost impossible that the photo had been taken just the spring before. Henry reached into the pocket of his jacket and took out the crude wooden statue he'd made for her in shop class. His teacher, Mr. Sean, had, when he was younger, gone down the Amazon in a canoe and visited a remote tribe in the jungle. And he said that when someone in the tribe got sick, they would carve a wooden statue, to help take the sickness away. Henry knew it wouldn't really work. But at this point, even the smallest sliver of hope, no matter how impossible, was better than nothing at all, if only for Connie and Richard's sake. He walked over and placed it on the pillows beside their mother's head. After staring down at her for a time, Henry walked over to the window and peered through the blinds. He was greeted by a fierce glare of yellow sunlight that half-blinded him and carved a narrow path through the semi-darkness. Just as quickly, Henry closed the blinds once again. Susan Evans' eyes suddenly flickered and opened on the sight of her children. For a moment, they just stared at each other, and Henry got the feeling that she didn't know where she was. Then, she seemed to focus on him, and a small smile appeared on her badly chapped lips. \"Hey, you guys...\" She spoke slowly and with effort, but even in her debilitated state, Henry could still feel her love for him, for all of them, if only from a few short words. \"Hi, Mom.\" Henry sidled back up to the bed, and Connie led Richard over by the hand. \"Why didn't you wake me?\" his mother asked. \"We thought you probably needed the sleep.\" \"You know I'd rather see my kids,\" Susan said. \"I've been waiting. To talk with you.\" Henry stopped breathing for a moment, and Connie audibly gulped, while Richard clung tightly to his sister. They had all been dreading this. Did she want to say goodbye? Or tell him how he had to be strong for the rest of the family? Or talk about the things he'd have to do after she was gone? Henry couldn't bear it. He quickly tried to distract her by pointing out the carved statue on the pillows beside her. \"Look what I made for you,\" he said. Susan turned her head slowly, and Henry quickly regretted not getting the carving himself and holding it up to where she could see it. \"It's beautiful, honey,\" Susan whispered. \"Thank you.\" \"I made it in shop class. Mr. Sean helped me. He told me that when he was younger he visited a tribe in the Amazon, and whenever someone got sick they would make...\" Henry's words trailed off. He wanted to keep talking, to tell any old stupid story that would prevent his mother from saying what she wanted to say. What she had to say. But Susan slipped her hand over Henry's, and she motioned for Connie and Richard to come over. And in her eyes, Henry could see that she knew he was just trying to stall. \"Has your father told you everything?\" she asked. Henry nodded reluctantly, while Connie just stared at the floor, trying to fight off her tears, and Richard buried his face in his small hands. \"Yes, Mom,\" Henry whispered in a slightly trembling voice. \"Then you know there's going to be some difficult times ahead. You're going to have to be strong for your brother and sister.\" Henry nodded. \"How are we going to get along without you?\" Connie asked, looking up at her, her voice audibly trembling, tears rolling down her cheeks. \"Sweetie...You're my children. You've all been strong since the day you were born. Use that now.\" Susan took a deep breath. \"And don't worry. I'll always be with you. Always.\" Henry looked up at her curiously. The effort to speak had made her tired already. He could feel her grip on his hand weakening. He placed his other hand on hers and held it. \"I know,\" he whispered through his tears. \"You're not going to die, Mom, I promise you. I won't let you. You're not going to because I won't let you. I promise. It's my promise...\" He could tell that their mother was fading. The effort to talk had finally caught up with her. But for a brief moment, she looked back into each of their eyes, and he could have sworn she was agreeing with him. Her lips moved slightly, and it seemed she was repeating that word again. Always... She wasn't going to die. Not really. He wouldn't let it happen. He couldn't let it happen... Then her eyes fell closed. A sense of panic grabbed at Henry and Connie gasped. But then they saw the slight rise and fall of her chest, and relaxed. She was still breathing. Henry heard the door open and footsteps coming up behind them. Wallace stared at his wife for a moment and then turned to his children. \"Has she been sleeping?\" he asked. \"She was awake for a couple minutes,\" Henry replied. \"Did she say anything?\" Now Connie nodded in reply. Wallace waited for one of them to say more, but when everyone stayed quiet, he didn't press the issue. They all had to find a way of coping with what was about to come. They stayed for another fifteen minutes, just sitting in silence, listening to the faint noise of Susan's breathing. As they stood to leave, Henry leaned in over his mother and parted her straight brown hair before giving her a final kiss on the forehead, as did Connie. Then Richard kissed her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. They very well knew that this could be the last time they'd be able to do so. A/N: To help change things up a bit for this story, I will be using some plot elements and \"spoken\" text from Ian McEwan's draft of the film from July 1991. Disclaimer: I do not own TGS.

Check it out for a bit more background info on the world this takes place in.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 - Family December 2-5 About nine hours later, around 4 a.m., Susan Carter Evans finally gave up the ghost she had become. Nurse Janet Larson was on duty that night, and had the phone number Dr. Callaghan had left at the station in the eventuality that this happened. She had gotten to know Susan very well in the time since the woman had checked herself in nearly three months ago. Through Susan, Janet knew how important her family had been. That was why she now had slight reservations about calling them at this hour. Wallace Evans sat hunched over the desk in his study, the darkness all but embracing him, the old, dimming lamp in the corner of the room notwithstanding. He knew it wasn't fair to treat his children any differently than he did himself. But Wallace also knew they would need the strength for the coming day. His touchphone, sitting on the desk in front of him, suddenly flared to life. Wallace looked at the number: 207-555-8139 . So this was it. Wallace had known this was coming eventually, but knowing never made it easier. He let out a heavy sigh before answering. \"Wallace Evans.\" \"Mr. Evans, this is Nurse Larson at Rock Harbor General.\" Wallace's mind spun. \"Is she...\" \"Yes, sir I'm afraid so. Not ten minutes ago.\" \"Thank you, nurse,\" Wallace said in a polite, but quavering voice before hanging up. He leaned back into the desk chair, rubbing his eyes. The kids... Wallace stood from the chair, stalking out of the darkened study and up the stairs to Henry's room, dreading what he had to do next. Richard was curled up asleep amidst a pile of blankets and pillows in the far corner, while Connie had taken the extra bed. I know they need to sleep, but they'd never forgive me if I didn't tell them... He slipped quietly through the door and turned on Henry's desk lamp, almost knocking over a stack of CDs in the process. Wallace hesitated for a second before sitting on the edge of Henry's bed and placing a hand on the boy's shoulder. \"Henry...\" he said, gently shaking his son to rouse him. Henry stirred under the covers and his eyes flickered open. For a few seconds he gazed blankly at Wallace, but then a look of dread dawned on the twelve year-old's face and he sat up. \"Dad...?!\" \"Henry. I –\" Henry shook his head. \"No. No, I promised her!\" Wallace suppressed the urge to sigh. \"Son...\" \"NO!\" Henry cried, the tears spilling freely from his eyes. Henry's cries had woken Connie and Richard, and soon the room was filled with the sobs of three agonized children. Wallace simply remained silent, choosing to let them mourn in their own way. Over three-thousand miles and three time zones away, Jack Evans was jerked from his sleep by a loud blaring noise not three feet from his face. He looked at the clock – it was only 1:30, and his alarm wasn't supposed to go off until 6:00. It was the landline extension. Jack grunted and reached for the phone. Then he saw the area code. 207... Maine. He answered. \"Hello?\" A familiar voice fell on his ears. \"Jack. It's Wallace.\" \"Wallace. Is everything...\" Jack paused and sat up abruptly. \"Is it Susan?\" His brother hesitated, but only briefly. \"Yes. She passed a half-hour ago.\" Jack chose his words carefully. \"I'm so sorry, Wallace. We all know what Susan meant to you and the kids.\" \"It's – it's almost a relief to know she's not in pain anymore,\" Wallace said haltingly. \"How are the kids doing?\" Wallace hesitated again before replying. \"As well as can be expected, I suppose. Henry cried himself back to sleep. Same with Connie and Rich.\" Silence pervaded the call for what seemed like an eternity before Jack spoke up. \"I'll fly out first thing tomorrow, Wallace.\" \"See you then, Jack.\" \"'Bye, Wallace.\" As Jack dropped the phone back into its cradle, his wife, Janice, sat up in bed. \"Jack? Who was that?\" \"Wallace.\" Janice inhaled sharply. \"Oh Lord, no. Susan?\" Jack nodded solemnly. He got out of bed and threw on his bathrobe and slippers before heading downstairs to his study. Janice followed partway but stopped in the hall just outside their bedroom and leaned against the wall, head in her hands. A series of soft footfalls in the dark off to Janice's left briefly startled her, until she looked up and realized just who it was. \"What's going on? Is everything all right, Mom?\" he asked sleepily. Janice shook her head 'no'. She didn't want to tell him right now. \"Go back to bed, hon. You'll find out in the morning.\" He just shrugged and retreated back into his darkened room. Janice sighed in relief. She'd half-expected some kind of smart-aleck comment from him about how it was technically morning already. The next day, Jack flew into Falmouth and drove up, followed the day after by Susan's family, namely her parents from East Florida, her sister from North Carolina, and several of Henry, Connie, and Richard's cousins from Dakota. Since Susan's hospital stay began, and even before that, the once-respectable house – despite everyone's best efforts – had become an almighty shambles, with dirty clothes in all of the bedrooms, dishes piled up in the sink and slowly rotting leftovers in the refrigerator. Thankfully, someone called a cleaning service. The day of the funeral, everyone told Henry and his siblings how sorry they were and what a great person their mother had been, and how they wanted the kids to come and visit them during summer vacation. The funeral service was held in the old, white clapboard Methodist church the family attended once or twice a month. Then they all got into limousines and went out to the 'new' town cemetery, a large stretch of snow-covered ground, monuments, and headstones near the edge of the forest. It was late morning, and the winter sun was actually rather comforting in a way. But Henry somehow still felt cold in his heavy coat, black suit jacket and slacks. The branches in the trees around them rustled in a light breeze, and a flock of geese soared high above. Out beyond the wrought-iron fence that ringed the cemetery, wisps of snow crawled along the ground or blew into small whirlwinds. Henry felt his father's hand on his shoulder as he stared blankly at the open hole in the frozen ground and at the shiny, dark wooden casket beside it. A dozen or so yards away, two men in heavy green coveralls sat against a small backhoe and waited. One wore a red wool cap and smoked a cigarette. It seemed like a pretty ironic thing for someone who worked in a cemetery to do. A priest wearing a heavy coat, black slacks, and a white collar opened a worn, leather-bound Bible and began to read: \"I am the resurrection and the life, sayeth the Lord. He that believeth in me, though he was dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die...\" Shall never die... Henry repeated the words in his mind. Shall never, ever die... He looked over at Connie and Richard. Their faces were red and puffy from crying at the service. Henry had had his time to cry, and now, he had to be strong for them. He had to take care of them. Just like he always had, but now more than ever. Then he looked at the faces of his mother's relatives and all the family friends and was surprised to see that many of them were looking back at him and his siblings. As if somehow they were the center of attention and not their mother. Henry knew it was only because they felt sorry for them. The kitchen counters and table were covered in food. Their mother's family fussed and cut and poured for the crowd of people who had arrived in a surprisingly festive mood. It was somewhat perplexing for Henry, and especially Connie and Richard, none of whom had ever attended either a funeral or the after-service 'wake' before, to see the people who had been sobbing by their mother's graveside less than an hour before now talking, if not cheerfully, at least animatedly, in their living room. It seemed as if half of Rock Harbor had shown up to pay their respects. Even more perplexing, and equally as annoying, were all the people who wanted to hug, kiss, and rub each of them on the head and pat their shoulders and tell them how sorry they all were. Henry – though he couldn't speak for Connie or Richard – knew they meant well, but so many of them were people he hardly knew; and while he didn't want to be mean or rude, he wished they'd keep their hands to themselves. Finally, after over a dozen people had said how wonderful their mother was, it got to be too much. He led Connie and Richard out the back door and onto the porch. He shut the door behind them, and the voices suddenly faded away, replaced by the sound of waves crashing against the shore, and some kids playing out in the driveway. Henry walked silently, with an arm around Connie's shoulders, and he lightly tousled Richard's hair. New voices reached his ears. \"The opportunity won't wait forever, Wallace. I should know. For the sake of your company and your employees, you've got to go.\" Henry held a hand up for his siblings to wait and he came around the corner of the porch. He was surprised to find his father and his Uncle Jack sitting in wicker chairs near the study window, talking. As soon as they saw him, the talking stopped. \"Hey, Henry, what are you doing out here?\" his father asked solemnly. \"I just had to get outside for a while,\" Henry said. He figured it was best not to say he'd brought Connie and Richard out here, too. \"You all right, Henry?\" Jack asked. He was a few years younger than Wallace and had medium-length brown hair that was lightly grayed near the temples. \"Yeah, I guess,\" Henry said. It was obvious that his uncle and father had been talking about something they didn't want him to know. \"Uh, I'll catch you later,\" he said, and started back around the corner. \"You sure you're okay?\" his father asked. \"Yeah, pretty sure,\" Henry replied with a shrug as he set off around the corner. That was one of the few half-truths he'd ever told. Wallace Evans watched his son walk out of sight and, unsurprisingly, lead his little brother and sister down into the yard. Then he turned back to his brother. \"I can't leave them at a time like this, Jack. They need me.\" \"We're not talking about an eternity, Wallace,\" Jack replied. \"It'll be two weeks.\" Wallace shook his head. \"I just can't do it.\" \"It's not like you'd be leaving them with strangers. I'm your brother, Wallace. We're family.\" \"I guess that's why we only see each other at funerals,\" Wallace replied. Jack winced, and Wallace immediately regretted his words. Three years earlier, Jack had lost his two-year-old son, Matthew. The boy had drowned in the bathtub at Jack's home in California. \"I'm sorry, Jack,\" Wallace quickly apologized. \"I don't know why I said that. I know you're just trying to help.\" \"It's a bad time,\" Jack said. \"Believe me, I understand.\" \"How is Janice?\" \"You mean in terms of what happened?\" Jack asked. Wallace nodded. Jack sighed. \"She has good days and not-so-good days. It's something you never stop living with, something you never quite forget. You wake up in the middle of the night wondering if there was anything you could have done differently. I still don't have an answer.\" \"God, Jack,\" Wallace said, shaking his head. \"I don't know if I can say just how sorry I am that that happened to you. If something like that happened to me, I don't know what the hell I'd do.\" \"Hey, something like that has happened to you.\" Jack put a hand on his brother's shoulder. \"I've known you your whole life, Wallace. You've never had to face anything like this before. Believe me, this is the time when you have to let other people in. You've got to let us help you.\" \"I just feel that leaving Henry, Connie, and Rich now is the worst thing I could possibly do,\" Wallace said. \"I mean, they just lost their mother. Now their father's going to disappear, too?\" \"Henry's old enough to understand, and I'm sure he'll help out Connie and Rich,\" Jack said reassuringly. \"Janice and I'll take care of them while you take care of business. You can't put it off any longer, Wallace. Your company's on the verge of going under.\" \"I'm not sure I really care,\" Wallace replied, his tone distant and almost lost in the wind. \"We've spent almost half our lives building these companies,\" Jack said. \"Throwing yours away now won't make anything better.\" Wallace stared over the porch rail, past the rocky shore beyond and out at the whitecap-covered bay. \"I just wonder if it was all worth it. I mean, all the weekends I worked. All those late nights at the office. Maybe I should have taken a regular nine-to-five job and stayed home.\" \"Wallace.\" Jack put his hands on his brother's shoulders again. \"Susan didn't get cancer because you worked hard. One has nothing to do with the other. You still care about your future, don't you? You care about Henry, Connie, and Richard's future.\" \"Of course I do,\" Wallace said, a hint of indignance in his voice. \"Then make sure they have one. You said that if you close this deal in Hong Kong, it could turn the company around. We both know how this works, Wallace. God knows how many times I've done it.\" \"Maybe,\" Wallace replied. \"It's never a sure thing until they've signed on the bottom line.\" \"But it's the only chance to save your company,\" Jack urged him. \"You've got to try it.\" Wallace glanced back out into the yard, where Henry had started Richard and Connie on a rather lethargic game of tag. Could he leave them? Even for two weeks? \"Listen, it'll be good for them to be with other kids,\" Jack said as if he'd read his brother's mind. \"I mean, you saw Henry a few minutes ago, and just look at the three of them right now. It's pretty obvious that they're lost around all these adults. If they come out to California they'll have Mark and Chloe to play with.\" Wallace sighed heavily and gazed out at the bay again. His brother had made a number of good points. He hated like hell leaving the kids for two weeks, but if he tried to look past those two weeks, everything Jack said rang true. He glanced back at his brother. \"What does Janice say?\" \"You know Janice,\" Jack said with a slight grin. \"She told me not to come back to California without them.\" Wallace blinked. Something about Jack taking his kids back with him on an airplane didn't feel right. \"No,\" he said. \"I'll bring them myself. The Chinese can wait an extra week. We need some time together.\" \"All right, then,\" Jack replied. \"I'll tell Janice to expect you and the kids sometime next week.\"[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 - The Discussion What leftovers there had been were now in the refrigerator. Everyone who didn't live there was gone. It was just Henry, his siblings, and their father. Wallace had distributed mugs of hot chocolate amongst them, after their time outside, but the cups were still largely full. \"How are you guys doing?\" their father asked. He left the question open-ended. Connie shrugged indifferently and blew into her mug to cool it off. Richard stayed silent. Henry was the only one to audibly respond. His voice was strained, exasperated. \"For the third time this evening, Dad...We're all fine. Same as earlier.\" \"Okay,\" Wallace said with a nod. \"Hungry?\" All three kids shook their heads. Even Richard wasn't hungry. Wallace softly blew the steam away from his mug of coffee. \"Look, there's something I have to talk to you guys about.\" Their father's tone scared him, but Henry suddenly felt a dim light of recognition. \"It's what you and Uncle Jack were talking about earlier.\" Wallace nodded. \"How'd you guys like to drive out to northern California with me?\" Richard's eyes widened, and Connie looked up from her mug, but Henry frowned. \"Why?\" he asked. \"Because I have to go to Hong Kong for a couple of weeks. Jack said he and Janice would like to have you stay with them.\" He could tell that that had piqued Connie and Richard's interest, but Henry shook his head. \"No way,\" he said firmly. Wallace wasn't surprised at all. \"I didn't think you'd be interested, Henry, but I'm afraid it's something we may have to do.\" \"I don't want to go,\" Henry said. \"I want to stay here with you, Connie, and Rich... and Mom.\" The furrows in Wallace's forehead wrinkled. It seemed like an odd thing to say, but he knew better than to challenge his son on it. \"I have to go to Hong Kong, Henry. If I don't, the company's going to be in big trouble. And if that happens, we'll all be in big trouble, too.\" \"Then why can't we come to Hong Kong with you?\" Henry asked. \"You can't,\" Wallace said. \"First of all, it'd be prohibitively expensive to bring all three of you. Second, I'll be in meetings all the time. There'll be nothing for you guys to do all day.\" \"We could take walks,\" Henry offered. \"Or watch movies and TV in the hotel,\" Connie said. \"And order in for food.\" \"No, believe me, you simply can't come,\" their father said. \"Believe me, it's not that I don't want you guys to come. I'd love that. But you just can't. And if I didn't have to go, I wouldn't. You've got to believe me, Henry.\" Henry just shrugged and nodded. \"Now, I guess I could make arrangements for you to stay with one of your friends around here,\" Wallace said. \"And that would most likely be Dylan or Eli. But I think it would be better if you spent some time with your aunt and uncle. I have a feeling we'll be seeing a lot more of them from now on anyway. They've got a son named Mark who's around your age, Henry, and a daughter named Chloe who's a couple years older than you, Connie. They're your first cousins. You've seen pictures of them.\" They had all seen the pictures. Not that you could tell much from pictures, but at least the kids didn't look like dorks or anything. \"Besides, none of you've ever been to California,\" Wallace said. \"It'll be a good change of pace.\" Henry looked over at his siblings, both of whom were warming to the idea, and then he stared across the table at his father. Normally he wouldn't say what was on his mind. But this wasn't normal. \"I'm just worried that we'll be lonely without you.\" \"Don't worry,\" Wallace said with a slight smile. \"After almost a week together in the car, you'll all be glad to get rid of me.\" That elicited a giggle from Richard and a smile from Connie. Henry merely nodded. At that moment, it was hard to know what felt right or wrong, or what he really wanted. \"Oh, and one other thing,\" Wallace said. \"Make sure you each pack the warmest coat you've got. Even California can still get cold at this time of year.\" December 6 The next night, the one before they were to hit the road, Wallace stayed on his phone for hours, making last-minute arrangements for his trip. Henry and Richard watched TV for a while and then went upstairs to Henry's room. Henry sat on his bed and looked around. His duffel and computer bags, as well as Richard's were packed and standing by the door. Connie, on the other hand, had been out at a friend's house until a couple hours ago and was still packing her things. Thank God that cleaning service took care of laundry, too, Henry thought. Henry looked at the portable CD player on his desk and thought about listening to something, but then another thought came to mind. He was going away. He had to say goodbye. \"I'll be back in a minute, Rich. Will you be all right by yourself?\" Richard nodded from his nest of pillows in the corner. \"Yeah...\" he mumbled. Henry got up and left the room, walking down the half-carpeted hall until he got to the door of his parents' room. It might have been strange, but he hadn't been in there in months, not since his mom went into the hospital. He pushed open the door. The lights weren't on, but the room wasn't that dark, either. The shades were up, and the moon outside was full, filling the room with a pale, white light. Henry slowly walked around to his mother's side of the bed. Just past it was the vanity table and mirror where she used to sit up in the morning, brushing her long brown hair. Her brush and blow-dryer were still there, along with some small glass jars of nail polish. Henry felt a terrible pang in his heart. It's as if she never left , he thought. As if she was still there. Maybe she was. Maybe he hadn't let her die after all. The pain in his heart was awful. It just wasn't fair that his mother was gone. He looked up at himself in the mirror. His eyes glistened with tears that threatened to tumble out and roll down his cheeks. He tried to blink them back. Maybe she's still here , he told himself. Maybe she hasn't left. But where was she? He sat on the bed and faced the closet. He was surprised to see the only thing that hung there: his mother's green, silk dress. The one she'd worn that day this past spring for the walk in the grove. He still remembered it. How alive she was. How happy. Lit by the flickering light overhead, the dress almost seemed to glow with a special aura. Henry wiped the tears from his eyes and stared at it. Could it be? He began to talk aimlessly in a low voice. \"Guess what? Dad says that when we get out into the open country, he's gonna let me steer the van. And I'm only twelve. That'll be great. Do you know how far we're going? Three-thousand, five-hundred and eighty miles. It may be California, but it can still get cold out on the Pacific...\" His voice trailed off, lowering to a whisper. \"Just tell me...that you're here, Mom... Give me a sign, OK?\" No response was forthcoming. Only silence. And the sound of the waves outside. \" Please ,\" he begged. But the dress just hung there, unmoving. \"Henry?\" He whirled around, and for a split second thought that maybe it really was her. But it was just Connie.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 - Argument December 7 The road was a ribbon of black, snaking through the snow-covered fields and forests of south-central Massachusetts at midday. Through the windshield, Wallace could see waves of cold air ripple off the asphalt. They'd left only that morning and were already on the I-90 heading west, roughly fifty miles outside of Boston. The dashboard and floor had quickly become littered with maps, empty cups, and food wrappers. Wallace glanced in the rearview mirror at Connie and Richard, both of whom were sleeping, and then over at Henry, who was wide awake and staring blankly out the windshield, listening to music on his portable CD player, a pair of earbuds practically closing the boy off from the outside world. Except for an occasional grunt of yes or no to a question about food or bodily functions, Henry hadn't said a word since the trip began. All he'd done was listen to his music. How he could even hear to answer Wallace's questions in the first place was beyond him. They were coming into another area of tall, rolling hills. Typical for this area of the Northeast, but were they covered in snow, and besides, Wallace needed something to distract Henry. Wallace gave Henry a tap on the shoulder. \"Hey you, fellow passenger. If you ever get tired of blowing your eardrums out, you're missing some great stuff out the window.\" If Henry had even heard him, he gave no sign of it. His eyes remained blankly fixed on the road ahead. The only sound from his side of the car was the faint beats of music through the earbuds. Rock music, if Wallace's experiences in the '70s were anything to go by. \"Wow!\" Wallace gasped. \"I just saw a guy with a two-barrel chasing a talking rabbit!\" Henry glanced over at his father and worked up a faint smile, letting him know that the joke was appreciated. Then he resumed staring blankly at the road. Wallace knew he wasn't making any progress. Chances were he wasn't going to make any, either, unless he forced the issue. He pulled the van off to the side of the road, kicking up a cloud of snow from the shoulder that drifted past them. Another car shot by, its passengers staring at them curiously. Wallace put the van into park, shut it off, and turned to his oldest son. Even though Henry's eyes stayed glued to the ground in front of the van, Wallace could still see him tense in anticipation of a confrontation. \"Henry?\" Even now, Henry hardly moved a muscle. Even the fingers that had tapped lightly to the music were now stilled. His teeth were – almost painfully – clamped down on his lower lip. \"I'm know you're hurting, Henry,\" Wallace said. \"But please don't shut me out like this.\" Henry continued to ignore him. Despite his best attempts at remaining calm, rational, and understanding, Wallace could feel himself starting to lose it. Finally, he reached over, paused the music, and disconnected the earbuds before grabbing the CD player itself and dropping the thing into the side pocket on the door. It had taken great restraint on Wallace's part not to simply hurl it out into the road. \"Now talk to me,\" Wallace said. \"What?!\" Henry snapped irritably as he pocketed the earbuds. Wallace raised his eyebrows. It wasn't like Henry to be angry and defiant. There was obviously a lot on his mind. \"Getting angry won't help,\" Wallace said. \"Especially since I'm not entirely sure what you're angry about. Is it me? Is it life? Is it Mom? I think about her all the time, too, you know.\" Henry stared at his father for a long moment. \"I don't know why we have to go out to California,\" he said. \"I told you why,\" Wallace said. \"I've got to go to Hong Kong. There's no one back home to take –\" \"She's coming back,\" Henry interrupted, practically blurting it out. \"Henry...\" his father's voice trailed off. \"Maybe she's not going to come back as herself,\" Henry said. \"But she's gonna come back. She'll give us some kind of sign, then we'll know...\" Wallace could feel his sense of surprise turn into a sharp, agonizing pain. Maybe he'd overestimated his oldest child's ability to deal with this crisis. Maybe he'd been foolish to assume a boy of twelve could assimilate it. \"Listen, Henry,\" he said softly. \"I miss her too. But we have to accept the fact that she's gone.\" \"No!\" Henry shouted. \"Yes.\" The next thing he knew, Henry had opened the van door and started to run off down the shoulder of the highway. Wallace watched in amazement as his son took off down the side of the road. He stilled his first impulse, which was to jump out of the car and sprint after him. Instead, he blearily rubbed his eyes and contemplated his next move. Henry just kept running. He didn't know why and he didn't know where. He felt like he had to get away. Away from his father. Away from what had happened to his mother. Away from himself. But then, just as suddenly as he'd started to run, he stopped. Who was he kidding? There was no place to go. He stood for a while with his back to the van and stared out over the guardrail. Just like his father had said, there were snow covered hills and trees everywhere. Not that Henry cared. Not that he was going to turn around and go back. Maybe he'd just stand there forever. But if he did, he'd probably freeze his own hide off in a few hours. That wasn't even close to forever. And what about Connie and Rich? He was their older brother, and they often relied on him even more than their own father. What would they do without him? He had virtually taken over most duties involving his siblings since their mother had entered the hospital back in October. He couldn't just leave his poor father to take on those duties all on his own. Henry took in a deep breath of the cold air. He shivered as he exhaled, but not from the cold. It was just...the memories. And the knowledge that from now on, things would be different. Hopefully, for the better, too. Using that thought as his motivation, Henry decided to just let things play out, and started back towards the van. He saw that his father had hardly moved at all, and was simply staring out into space. Wallace noticed him coming back and gave a slight smile. Henry was grateful that his father had decided to give him the space and time to think on his own. As soon as Henry had pulled the door shut, Wallace began talking. \"You know, there's some people who just want to pull inside themselves, to hide from the world and let it all go. But if everyone did that, where would be all the fun in life? And then there are people like you, Henry. You just want to step out there in the wide open spaces and experience the beauty of the world. Your mother was like that. She loved going out in the middle of nowhere, pitching a tent, and eating burnt hotdogs and s'mores on sticks over a fire.\" Henry chuckled a bit and a smile played at the corners of his mouth. \"Yeah. That's just like her.\" \"I don't know if I've ever told you or your sibs this, but, a couple years after we were married – and a couple years before we had you – she talked me into hiking the Appalachian Trail. And in the fall no less.\" \"Really?\" Henry's interest was clearly piqued. Wallace nodded and smiled as he restarted the van. The near-silent electric engine of the V-2/E kicked in and low thrum ran through the floor. \"You betcha. We started out at the south foot of Mount Katahdin in mid-October, and we just kept on going for nearly two weeks. Nearly made it down to New York, too. Your mother had her goals, like making sure we kept a consistent pace, or being careful with our rations. She loved being away from civilization, the silence, and, having to rely on her own strength. So much like you...\" \"Do you think we could do that, sometime, Dad?\" Henry asked. His voice was a bit excited and he sounded eager. Wallace smiled as he pulled back onto the highway. \"Maybe one day, Henry. One day.\" His sense of adventure and interest clearly awakened from their long slumber, Henry eagerly plied his father for more stories about him and Susan, their earlier argument now forgotten. Connie and Richard both woke up some time later and eagerly joined in as well. They all listened to Wallace in rapt fascination, smiling and laughing aloud for the first time in what felt like forever as the van sped onward toward the approaching night. A/N: I hope you like the changes so far. Side Note : The family van, a 'V-2/E', is an all-electric DeLorean minivan. In this universe, the DeLorean Motor Company never goes out of business and greatly expands its' vehicle inventory in the late 1980s.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 - Travels & Introductions December 8-11 Their journey took them through the remainder of Massachusetts and into New York, passing directly through a pre-dawn Albany, then on to eastern Erie, where they stopped for a time to view Niagara Falls and visit the AN Tower in Yorktown. From there, they passed into Michigan, and in Detroit, they visited a car museum and admired its extensive and rare collection before crossing down into Ohio and heading west through northern Indiana. They soon reached Illinois, for a stop just outside Chicago and a visit to the first McDonald's ever built. Then they crossed the Mississippi River and into Iowa, where the kids saw more cornfields than they ever thought existed. Nebraska was much of the same, and the dozens of oil derricks there didn't offer much in the way of scenery, though it was also where Wallace let Henry drive for a few minutes, on a largely empty stretch of the I-80 west of the state capital. That was a moment Henry wouldn't soon forget. Cheyenne was where they finally got their first view of the majestic, snow-capped Rocky Mountains, somewhere west of Fremont, and it was also where they stayed in a motel reminiscent of old Western movies. Their biggest surprise yet was crossing Lake Bonneville in western Utah. The anchored floating bridge that spanned the lake amazed even Henry, and utterly fascinated Richard, while Connie was lost in gazing out over the azure waters that stretched to the northern and southern horizons. Northern Nevada was almost entirely a boring, mountainous desert. Reno was really the only thing worthy of mention, and that was giving the 'Vegas of Nevada' credit. By the time they reached northern California, the sun had begun to rise over the Sierras to the east, and casted muted reddish-orange rays of light across the foggy landscape of the Central Valley. It was a good trip for the family, and when they finally reached the California coast, Henry had long since dropped his defenses and allowed some of his long-dormant boyish enthusiasm to come out. \"Oh, wow!\" he and his siblings all gasped the first time the deep-blue Pacific Ocean came into their view. It was such a sharp contrast to the steel-gray waters of the Atlantic and Scotia Bay back home. They pulled into a small parking lot on the ocean side of the road. It was a windy and rather foggy day, and they grabbed their jackets. Once they got out of the car, despite their heavy coats, the kids were all shivering to varying degrees in no time. \"Okay, not so bad,\" Henry said as they stood at the guardrail by the side of the road. \"But it's this fog...\" \"I know. We may be further south than Maine, but the air's still pretty damp around here,\" Wallace said, pulling the collar of his jacket closed. \"Maybe we'd better get back in the van. Especially so Connie and Rich don't catch cold.\" But the kids all shook their heads. \"No, I want to see it.\" Henry stepped over the guardrail and walked a little way until he'd come to the edge of a low cliff. Below him the waves crashed against the base, throwing up clouds of spray. \"It's bigger than the Atlantic,\" Henry remarked, hugging himself and staring out at the ocean covered with whitecaps. \"I know,\" Wallace said, joining him. \"It's hard to imagine something you can't see the end of. The Atlantic is one thing, but the Pacific is more than twice the size and almost twice as deep.\" Henry already knew that, but he whistled in amazement nonetheless. Connie pointed west from her and Richard's position back at the guardrail. \"What if you had a boat and just kept going and going?\" she asked. \"You'd hit East Asia – probably Japan – sooner or later,\" their father replied. It wasn't much longer before the kids all got too chilled to stay outside. They got back in the van and Wallace talked about the value of wearing the proper clothing. He was more reminding them than anything else. Their route followed the winding coastal highway, and they soon came up to and passed a large, green and white wooden sign welcoming them to Castel, California, Population: 10,200. \"Is this where Uncle Jack lives?\" Henry asked, his curiosity growing. \"Yup,\" Wallace replied as they drove through the center of town. \"Pretty place, huh?\" Henry and Connie both nodded in agreement. They'd never seen anything quite like it. The buildings were a mix of Spanish-style wood/brick and concrete, modern, and some post-WWII construction, many of which were painted a variety of colors, namely red, blue, yellow, dark green, and most commonly white. The big picture window of the hardware store featured rows of gardening implements and a riding mower, while an auto shop was having a special sale on four-wheel dirt bikes. Then they passed several mission-style coastal hamlets. One even had a lighthouse attached. Off to the left of the road, a group of people holding large, handmade signs were walking down a sandy slope to an expansive beach far below, which was ringed on either side by relatively high cliffs. \"What's with all the people down on the beach?\" Connie asked. \"And all the signs?\" Richard added. \"Huh?\" Wallace was caught off guard by their questions. \"What kind of signs?\" Henry scratched the back of his head. \"I saw 'em, too. They said something about the beach, I think.\" \"Oh, that...\" Wallace said. \"Your Uncle Jack's been keeping in touch about that, and you'll all get an earful from your Aunt Janice soon enough.\" \"About what all those people are doing down on the beach?\" Connie asked. Their father nodded. It wasn't long before they had largely left the town behind. To their right, driveways wound down through the rocky hills to the road, but more often than not, it was virtually impossible to see the houses they led to. Finally, Wallace turned left, onto one marked Private . Same as their house. \"Uh, Dad, is Uncle Jack rich?\" Henry asked. \"Let's just say he's done well,\" Wallace said with a wry smile. \"Is he in the same business as you?\" Henry asked. \"Computer software?\" \"Sort of. Jack started up his company back in the seventies,\" Wallace said. \"The difference is, he purely focuses on computers.\" \"And yours?\" \"Mine deals more with trading stocks,\" Wallace explained. \"You've heard me explain it before, Henry.\" Henry nodded. He had, but most of it had long since slipped his mind. He merely agreed so their father wouldn't launch into a long-winded explanation that would leave Connie and Richard in the proverbial dust. \"So is Uncle Jack rich or not?\" Connie asked, basically reiterating Henry's original question. \"Let's just put it this way,\" Wallace said. \"Just like us, Jack's family is quite comfortable. They don't have many expensive things, but they could if they wanted to.\" Fortunately, Wallace held off on saying, That probably won't include us for much longer, though. Connie nodded. \"Okay...\" \"I gotcha,\" Henry said. The van rounded a slight curve in the drive and Jack's house came into view. Situated on a bluff overlooking the ocean, it was an ultramodern home, with huge, clear glass windows, and a black-and-white-painted concrete exterior mixed with rough, gray stones. There was a huge second story porch in back and a large, well-manicured lawn that backed up against the nearby woods, in addition to a well-maintained garden that surrounded much of the exterior. There was a single, gray-brick chimney that rose from the center of the house, and a thin wisp of smoke drifted from it, occasionally twisted into swirls by the wind. Wallace finally stopped the van near the end of the driveway, behind an older, green Ford minivan and a gleaming, black Audi sedan, both of which were parked under a detached concrete and metal carport. \"I though you said they didn't have very many expensive things,\" Henry said, eyeing the four-door Audi. Wallace shrugged. \"So Jack got himself a new car since the last time I was out here.\" They all got out and stretched. \"So, not bad, huh?\" Wallace asked, gazing at the house. The kids all nodded in agreement. There was something about the house that felt friendly. Even though it was pretty big, it wasn't too formal or foreboding. A few bikes lay in the front lawn – one red, one blue, and a smaller pink one – while there was also a backstop for baseball, a soccer net, and a tall basketball hoop by the edge of the driveway. Henry wasn't entirely sure what he'd expected, but he felt relieved all the same. The front door swung open, and Jack came out wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans and white sneakers. Following in his wake and clutching his hand was a young girl, who was probably seven or eight, and had dark blond hair that was pulled back into a ponytail. She must be Chloe. Jack was smiling and Chloe was laughing. Still, Connie and Richard both apparently felt a little shy and stood back and watched as their uncle and cousin came down to greet their father. \"Hey!\" Jack said, extending a hand. \"You made it.\" \"Oh, what a haul,\" Wallace said, shaking his brother's hand. \"Fifteen states in four days.\" \"Fifteen?\" Jack asked. \"Went through Erie, didn't you?\" \"Yeah, I thought it'd be more interesting for the kids. They hadn't seen Niagara Falls before, and they've never seen anything west of the Mississippi. At least as far as some of them remember,\" Wallace grinned down at his kids, and they all either shrugged or adopted confused looks, not having the slightest clue what their father had meant by that last part. Chloe began to fidget and tug at Jack's hand. \"Okay, okay, you,\" Jack said with a laugh, and he kneeled beside his daughter. \"Chloe, say hello to your Uncle Wallace.\" \"Hello, Uncle Wallace!\" Chloe shouted. Jack winced. \"Thanks, hon. That was right in my ear.\" \"Hi, Chloe, how are you?\" Henry's father asked, grinning. \"Okay.\" Now Chloe got shy and hid behind her father. Wallace smiled at his brother. \"She's beautiful, Jack.\" \"Thanks. Takes after her mother for sure,\" Jack replied as he got back up, grinning. Henry stepped forward and held his hand out. \"Uncle Jack. Long time, no see, huh?\" His voice had a sarcastic, playful lilt to it. Jack laughed and shook his hand. \"Henry. Yeah, it sure has.\" Then he gently nudged Chloe back out into the open. \"Chloe, this is Henry. Henry, this is my little angel, Chloe.\" \"Hey, Chloe,\" Henry said in a friendly voice. \"How are you?\" \"Pretty good,\" Chloe replied in a mildly timid voice, cracking a small smile. Connie and Richard soon came forward and, following their brother's example, introduced themselves to Jack and Chloe. \"How'd you guys like the trip?\" Jack asked. \"It was pretty cool,\" Henry said. \"The Rockies definitely put the Appalachians to shame.\" \"'Cept for the flat parts,\" Richard said. Jack chuckled. \"I'm afraid the Midwest doesn't really have much in the way of exciting terrain.\" \"It's real pretty around here, though,\" Connie added. \"Isn't it?\" Jack asked. \"The ocean and the shoreline. A lot of little coves and islands. Kind of reminds me of Maine, the warmer water and actual beaches aside.\" Chloe was now tugging at Jack's arm rather impatiently. \"Hey, what...\" he started to ask, but then he appeared to remember. \"Oh, right. Okay.\" He let Chloe go and she came toward Henry, took his hand and started to pull. \"Mom said I could show you guys the house. Come on!\" Henry scowled at Jack. \"Don't try to resist, Henry,\" Jack said with a laugh. \"She always gets her way.\" Wallace smiled and nodded at Connie and Richard. \"Well, go on. I'm certain she doesn't bite.\" That got a laugh from Jack. Connie led Richard by the hand toward where Chloe was already dragging Henry off, around the side of the house. \"Just watch out for the sprinklers!\" Jack called out, grinning. Wallace started toward the front door, but Jack reached for his brother's arm to stop him. \"How's he doing?\" Jack asked. \"Henry?\" Jack nodded. Wallace watched as Chloe pulled his son around the corner of the house, Connie and Richard following at their heels. \"Okay, I guess. It's kind of hard to tell.\" \"He doesn't talk about it?\" Jack guessed. \"Not much,\" Wallace replied. \"We had an incident the first day on the road. Henry keeps insisting that Susan isn't gone. That she's still here. I can't quite get a handle on what he means. Like, does he think she's still physically here? Or spiritually? Or is he talking about her living on in our memories?\" \"Think it's something serious?\" Jack asked. \"I don't think so,\" Wallace said. \"Probably just what a boy of his age does at a time like this. And, at the very least, I hope he doesn't spout off about it too much around Connie and Richard. Hearing something like that wouldn't be too good for them right now.\" Jack nodded. The two brothers stood quietly in the damp, northern California air. \"And how are you doing?\" Jack asked. Wallace shrugged. \"I'm best off when I'm feeling numb.\" \"You two had a good marriage,\" Jack said sadly. \"It's times like this that probably make you wish you hadn't.\" The mention of marriage reminded Wallace of something: \"You sure Janice is up to this? I don't want the kids to be a burden.\" Jack put on a forced smile. \"Believe me, they won't be. It'll be good for Janice to have a distraction. Come on, let's go in and see her. She'll be happy to see you.\" \"Oh, the kids noticed something about what's going on down at the beach while we were driving in,\" Wallace said. Jack sighed and groaned. \"With any luck, maybe they'll forget it by the time they meet Janice. Even if they don't, she brings it up at dinner almost every night, anyways.\" He and Wallace started toward the house. Ahead, they could see that the first thing Chloe had chosen to show Henry, Connie, and Richard was the yard. \"See how big it is?\" she asked, running through the grass in huge, looping circles to demonstrate. Henry jogged after her, while Connie and Richard had chosen to follow along at a more leisurely pace. Henry was surprised at how stiff his legs really were and how quickly he started puffing for air, but after over four days of largely sitting in a car, he shouldn't have been surprised. Finally, Chloe led them to the front door. \"Want to see my room first?\" Chloe asked, in a voice filled with childish excitement. \"It's upstairs. Nineteen steps.\" She pushed open the front door and they stepped into the entryway, where Henry, Connie, and Richard got their first impression of the interior of the house. The walls were painted white and covered in wooden-framed pictures. The gray carpet in a nearby room contrasted with the dark, polished hardwood floors. Most of the furniture Henry could see looked almost brand new and just as modern as the house. Before Chloe could pull Henry and his siblings upstairs, a voice called out, \"Chloe? Are they here?\" An attractive woman of slightly above-average height with shoulder-length golden hair and large green eyes, wearing jeans and a plain, loose-fitting t-shirt, stepped out into the hallway. As she walked toward them, her eyes met Henry's and they stared at each other as if in a trance of sorts. Henry suddenly had the strangest feeling, that, as if for that very short span of time, there was no one else there except her. He felt goose bumps run down his arms. It felt as if, in some strange way, they immediately shared something. Or maybe it was the feeling that they somehow already knew each other very well. Then Henry heard his father and Jack come up behind them and into the house, the heavy door closing in their wake. The spell was broken. Everyone gathered in the entryway together. The woman turned to Wallace and hugged him. \"Wallace,\" she said, giving him a light kiss on the cheek. \"It's been too long.\" \"Janice, you look great,\" Wallace said, returning the hug. But Janice was already looking back at Henry. \"Henry... I can't believe it's been ten years. Look at you,\" she said, gazing at the boy. Jack gave Henry a playful nudge. \"Better run,\" he said, grinning. \"I think she's going to hug you.\" \"Try and stop me,\" Janice said with a smile. Henry wasn't sure if Jack was joking or not about running. But the next thing he knew, Janice was reaching toward him. She took him in her arms. Henry had the strangest feeling when she did that. He didn't understand what it was, and it could have made him uncomfortable. But as if she sensed it, Janice didn't drag it out, either. \"And you two must be Connie and Richard,\" she said, bending down and giving Henry's younger siblings brief hugs as well. \"I half-forgot you'd never met them before, Janice,\" Wallace said. \"They're adorable, Wallace.\" Wallace nodded in acceptance of her compliment. Janice's next question was directed at Richard. \"And just how old are you, Richard?\" Richard held up four fingers. \"Four,\" he replied timidly. \"You remind me of someone at that age,\" Janice said playfully, looking back at Henry. There was a twinkle in her eyes. Now Chloe pushed her way into the group and pulled at her mother's shirt sleeve insistently. \"Mom, please , I have to show Henry and his sibs the house,\" she said, an air of importance in her voice. She held out her hand to Henry again, but before he could go with her, Jack grabbed her. \"Whoa there,\" he said with a laugh as he tickled her. \"Don't forget that Henry, Connie and Richard are members of the family now, too.\" Still holding Chloe, Jack turned to Henry. \"If anybody gives you guys trouble, especially this little monster, you come to me.\" Jack and Chloe started to roughhouse a little. Henry just stood there beside Connie and Richard and watched. He noticed that their father and Janice had backed away from the group and were talking in hushed tones. It wasn't any stretch of the imagination to guess that they were talking about him and his mother. \"How are they taking it?\" Janice asked softly. \"Pretty hard, I'm afraid,\" Wallace replied. \"Well, he doesn't show it, but mainly Henry is.\" \"Did Jack tell you about Maggie Goldblum?\" \"No.\" \"She's a therapist,\" Janice said. Wallace began to scowl. \"But she's also a friend,\" Janice hastened to add. \"We've known her for years. You'll like her.\" \"I'm going to meet her?\" Wallace asked, puzzled. \"We've invited her over for dinner tonight,\" Janice explained. It took Wallace a moment to sort it all out, but then he realized that it had been a subtle arrangement for Henry. \"You're not mad, are you?\" asked Janice, sounding mildly concerned. \"No, I don't think so.\" Wallace chose his words carefully. \"Let's see how things work out. But even if they don't, I want you to know how much I appreciate everything you're doing.\" Janice took his hand and squeezed it. \"Susan would have done the same.\" The atmosphere in the entryway was warm and friendly. Henry watched as Chloe roughhoused with her father, and Wallace spoke quietly with Janice. He was starting to think that maybe it would be okay here. He gave Connie and Richard each an affirming smile and a pat on the head. \" Ahhh! \" Connie suddenly screamed and pointed up the stairs. Everyone stopped what they were doing and stared. In the hall upstairs, leering out over the wall-like banister, a dark, cold face of some kind of creature stared back at them. It was surrounded by what could have been heavy green and brown fur. Connie and Richard squeezed in close to Henry. Richard whimpered in fear. Chloe, on the other hand, seemed surprisingly nonplussed about it and rolled her eyes. For one long, stunned moment, nobody spoke. Jack was first to break the silence. \"Very funny. Now come on down here, Bushmaster.\" Bushmaster...? Then Henry realized that the so-called creature's face was only covered in a coat of black and green face paint, and that the 'fur' was a ghillie suit. The boy wearing it was also of virtually equal height to Henry, and probably the same age, too. He must be Mark . Still fully-clad in the ghillie suit, Mark Evans howled like a creature of the night (and looked the part of one) as he bounded down the carpeted stairs and proceeded to jump from the bottom landing, skipping the last five steps altogether. He landed with a loud Thud! on the entryway floor. Suddenly pretending to have a terrible limp, he staggered toward Henry, making strange, incoherent sounds. Sounds like he's watched too many cheap zombie movies ... Out of the corner of his eye, Henry saw Janice's look of shock change to one of embarrassment and amusement. Connie and Richard still clung to Henry in fear. \"Okay, you. Hospitality,\" Jack said in a tolerant, if not mildly amused tone of voice. Mark pulled down the hood of the ghillie suit and took off the ball cap he had been wearing. He smiled through the heavy face paint, as if he were pleased with the effect he'd had on everyone present. He had blue-green eyes, crew-cut brown hair, a face that was quick to smile, and a presence that seemed to radiate energy. Then he handed something to Henry. Henry looked down and saw that it was a canister of specialized face paint. \"You put it on your face. Just like a football player,\" Mark said. \"Mark...\" Janice said, nodding to her son. \"Introductions.\" The boy looked to his mother, confused for a split second, and then his face brightened again and he looked back to Henry. \"Hi, I'm Mark.\" Henry offered his hand and Mark took it in a firm grip. \"Henry.\" \"You three attached, or something?\" Mark asked. \"Huh?\" Mark nodded to Connie and Richard. Henry laughed \"No. They're my little sibs.\" He ushered Connie and Richard out into the open. \"It's okay, guys. This is Mark,\" Henry said, smiling. \"Always glad to meet the family,\" Mark said. \"Why do you have fur?\" Richard asked Mark in a timid voice. \"It's not fur,\" Mark replied. \"It's something people use when they want to stay hidden in the outdoors.\" And then without prompt, with Connie and Richard's wide gazes still locked on him, Mark strode over to Wallace and offered his hand, a huge grin plastered on his face. \"Hi, Uncle Wallace.\" Wallace took the boy's hand and shook it, taking in the full extent of his nephew's getup. \"Mark. It's been a long time.\" \"Must be. I don't even remember the last one,\" Mark said, his eyes twinkling. Janice rolled her eyes and Jack shook his head in amusement. Henry then held up the can (or was it a bottle?) of paint that Mark had given him. \"How does this stuff work?\" Mark walked back over, took the paint from him, removed the lid, and sprayed some onto his fingers. Then he reached toward Henry and quickly rubbed two rough, black lines onto his face, halfway between his nose and ears. Just like a football player. Henry looked around at everyone. They laughed in relieved amusement. He could hear his father chuckling and his siblings giggling, too. Henry turned to face Mark again. Now with partially matching face paint, the boys shook hands again and clapped each other on the back in a show of friendship. \"Now we can be brothers,\" Mark said. Janice smiled and ruffled Mark's hair. \"As if one wasn't enough,\" she said to Jack before turning to Wallace. \"You may not believe this, but he's my darling, special boy,\" she said with a lighthearted chuckle. A/N: I hope you're liking it so far. And, at some point in the future, I may ask for some suggestions to help change up the plot a bit more. Specifics at a later time. Also, Cheyenne is this AU's name for Wyoming, and Fremont is our Cheyenne, the state capital.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 - A New Family The rest of the afternoon passed quickly. Chloe insisted on completing the tour of the house with Henry, Connie, and Richard. Henry was certain he'd never been in such a modern house. Everything he could see was state-of-the-art in some form or another. They covered two floors and the second story porch (which turned out to be attached to Jack and Janice's bedroom), skipping the attic and the basement. Then Mark joined them and they walked down to the backyard, which ended in a stone wall near the edge of a set of low cliffs. White gulls hung in the air above, letting out screeching cries that echoed through the air, while a cool sea mist drifted in from the water beyond. Fortunately, the fog had long-since burned away, though the sun was now behind a bank of gray clouds. Mark took the time in between throwing stones at the curling blue waves below to strike up some small talk with Henry, while Chloe went off to play with Connie and Richard. \"So, Henry... What's life like in Maine?\" Henry hesitated, but only for a brief second. \"There's some vague similarities to what I've seen of California, so I've been able to draw a few parallels. The ocean, for one.\" \"But...?\" Mark asked the question in an open-ended way. \"But, from what I can tell, Maine's got a lot more trees than California, and, it's generally...greener. Ever since Cheyenne and Nevada, I've seen mostly desert.\" Mark chuckled. \"That's what you think? Just wait 'till we go up north. Around Lassen and Shasta, it's all forest. And you'd be surprised what you can find around here, too.\" A cool, damp breeze blew past and Henry shivered slightly and rubbed his hands together. \"You all right, man?\" asked Mark. Henry shrugged indifferently. \"I've been through far worse. Try the big nor'easter this past March.\" \"The one they called 'the Storm of the Century?'\" Mark asked. Henry nodded before continuing. \"Dumped anywhere from six inches to four feet of snow all the way from Atlanta to Halifax, and thermometers dipped under zero. It wasn't terribly unusual for Maine, but then again, it was mid-March, so, yeah... Like I said, this is nothing. Count yourself lucky, Mark. Compared to us, you live in the tropics.\" Mark nodded. At that moment, Chloe strode up to Henry, a concerned look in her eyes when she saw him rubbing his hands together. \"Are you cold, Henry?\" she asked. Henry looked down into his younger cousin's eyes, shook his head, and smiled at her concern for him. \"Naw. In Maine, we're used to far colder than this.\" Chloe nodded, understanding. \"All the same, we should probably go back in now.\" He wouldn't admit it aloud, but Henry wholeheartedly agreed with her, and he started following Chloe and his siblings back toward the house. But a moment later, when he turned around to see if Mark was following, Henry caught a split-second glimpse of some odd look in the boy's eyes. He couldn't quite place it. Thankfully, they weren't outside much longer. When the kids got back to the house, they decided to cut through the kitchen, where Janice was starting to prepare that evening's dinner. Mark's mother was just setting a pot of boiling water on the stove when she noticed that Henry was rubbing his hands together. \"Are you cold?\" she asked. \"Not now,\" Henry replied as he slipped out of his jacket. \"If anything, being here for a couple weeks will probably soften me up. We're all used to pretty cold temps.\" \"In that case, your jackets might be a bit too much.\" Henry shrugged and answered for his brother and sister. \"These are the lightest jackets we've got.\" Having a light jacket or none at all verged on idiocy back in Maine, except in the summer months, that is. \"Then we'll have to let you use one of Mark's, won't we?\" Janice said, glancing over at her son, now seated on a barstool across the counter from her. Henry looked at Mark, and for just a second, he could have sworn he saw the coldest look pass over the boy's face. But just as quickly, it was gone, much like the one down on the beach. \"Hey, sure,\" Mark said, a warm and open smile. \"We're brothers. What's mine is yours.\" Henry smiled back and wondered about the look he thought he'd seen on Mark's face – twice now, too. Did it seem intensely dark and hateful? Henry mentally shook it off. He'd probably just imagined it. Janice then turned her attention to Connie and Richard. \"We can probably find light jackets for you two,\" Janice said. \"And, if it's all right with Chloe, maybe you can borrow one of hers, Connie.\" \"That's fine with me,\" Chloe said, shrugging. \"I haven't worn most of them in years anyway.\" \"Thanks!\" Connie exclaimed happily. She was glad to establish a friendly rapport with her cousin. \"That just leaves you, Richard. I think...\" Janice trailed off, with a wistful look in her eyes. \"You okay, Aunt Janice?\" Richard asked. His young voice was filled with worry. Janice nodded and quickly regained her composure. \"I'm fine, Richard. Thank you. I think I can find a light jacket for you somewhere, but if we can't you may have to use one of Mark's old ones.\" Richard wrinkled his nose. \"Don't worry, Richard. It won't be that bad, will it, Mark?\" Janice asked, turning back to face her son. For the third time that he could count, Henry saw a cold look pass over Mark's face, but just like before, it was gone in a split second. But this time, Henry knew he hadn't imagined it. It was strange... \"No problem at all,\" Mark said, smiling at his mother and Richard. \"I'll do anything I can for my little cuz.\" Once it started to get dark outside, the kids all headed into the dining room for dinner. They stood by a big, polished dark wood table in the center of the room, with a large beige rug underfoot. The side of the room that faced the ocean was entirely encompassed by a huge floor-to-ceiling window draped on either side by heavy green curtains. On the opposite side of the room, several rows of portraits hung on the wall. The AC system hummed in the background, while a small fire crackled in the stone fireplace. \"Why do they look familiar?\" Henry asked, gesturing to one of the portraits. He, Connie, Richard, Mark, and Chloe were the only ones in the room for the moment. Jack and Janice were in the kitchen, and Wallace was talking with a lady who'd just arrived. \"They're our dad's parents,\" Chloe said rather confidently. \"No, they're his grandparents,\" Mark corrected. So that was who they were. Henry knew his grandparents pretty well and that photo wasn't them. Then he realized where he'd seen it before – in an album his father had shown him and Connie a few years ago. Henry noticed, and not for the first time, that Mark often corrected his little sister and sometimes seemed very harsh towards her. Then at other times he seemed warm and caring. If he had had no siblings, Henry would have just figured that this was the way brothers and sisters were. But it wasn't. He'd never treat Connie like that. \"They built our old house,\" Chloe explained. \"Actually they had it built,\" Mark corrected her again, a tone of minor irritation in his voice. \"It wasn't like they built it with their own hands.\" Chloe glared at her brother. \"Know it all,\" she muttered under her breath. \"Okay, guys,\" Jack said as he came in carrying a big tray with a pork roast on it. \"Time to sit.\" Henry and his siblings all looked at the table with uncertainty. \"We sit at this end,\" Mark said, gesturing with his hand. \"The adults sit at the other end.\" Mark sat down at the far end of the table, while Henry sat catercorner from him, Richard sat beside Henry – in a booster seat – and Connie and Chloe sat across from Henry and Richard. Now Wallace and the woman he'd been talking to entered from the kitchen. The woman looked older than Henry's father, and nearly as old as his grandparents. Henry figured she was somewhere in her late sixties. Her hair was a mixture of gray and white, and she wore a loose-fitting red dress along with gold wire-rim glasses and had a kind smile. She vaguely reminded Henry of Miss Davenport from school. \"Kids, this is Maggie Goldblum,\" Wallace said as he sat down beside her. \"She's an old friend of Jack and Janice's.\" \"Hi, Miss Goldblum,\" Henry said with a polite nod, as if he were greeting a new teacher. Connie echoed his sentiment, while Richard opted to shyly wave at her. From the way she and Wallace had been talking, Henry sensed that she was more than just a friend of his aunt and uncle's. \"Hello, Henry. Connie. Richard,\" Maggie said, nodding to each of them in turn. \"Your father's told me a lot about you.\" \"All good stuff, I trust,\" Henry replied. Maggie smiled warmly. \"Oh, yes it was.\" Henry smiled back. He had a feeling this wouldn't be the last time he or his siblings saw Maggie while they were in California. \"Okay, then, Mark. You know what to do,\" Jack said as he began to slice the roast. \"Sure, Dad,\" Mark said before backing out of his chair and leaving the room. He returned with a bottle of red wine and four champagne flutes. Then he placed one by each of the adults' places and filled the glasses about halfway. Henry and Richard both watched him as he did so. Suddenly, Mark caught their gaze and winked mischievously. Then he lifted the wine bottle to his lips and pretended to guzzle from it. \"Daddy, look!\" Chloe squealed. Jack looked up and smiled in amusement. \"Okay, wise guy, very funny.\" He handed Mark a plate of food. \"Pass this to Henry.\" Janice came in from the kitchen and sat down. \"Okay, everyone, dig in.\" Wallace stared down at the thick slab of roast pork on his plate, surrounded by mashed potatoes and mixture of fresh vegetables. It was the first good home-cooked meal he'd had in five months. \"Something wrong, Wallace?\" Janice asked, puzzled. \"No,\" Wallace said with a smile. \"It looks... good enough to eat.\" The adults and Mark laughed, but Henry wasn't entirely certain what was so funny. \"No offense, Henry,\" Wallace added hastily. He gave his father a wry, understanding smile. \"None taken.\" Sometimes Henry had been forced to cook dinner on the nights they got tired of takeout, and when Wallace hadn't come back home yet. The best he could do was spaghetti, grilled cheese, mac & cheese, or even PB&J;'s, when it came right down to it. Connie and Richard had learned the hard way not to be picky eaters. \"Better load up then, Wallace,\" Jack advised his brother. \"This'll be your last home-cooked meal for a while.\" Because he was going to Hong Kong. Henry straightened up and blinked furiously. He'd almost forgotten that soon he, Connie, and Richard would be there alone with Jack and his family. Not that it upset him particularly. Especially since Janice and Jack seemed so nice. Chloe was okay, although Henry knew he'd have to wait to see if she turned out to be one of those clingy, leech-type sisters who had to follow you around everywhere. Fortunately, Connie wasn't typically like that. And that left Mark. So far he seemed okay, especially since he put out the whole 'brothers' thing. It had been fun talking with him and going down to the beach to throw rocks out into the water. But there was still something about Mark that struck Henry as a little strange. He could still remember those looks he'd seen on his face, first down by the beach while coming in, and then when Janice suggested that he and Richard borrow a couple of Mark's coats. Or like how he treated Chloe. And once or twice that afternoon, he'd looked at Mark and felt a strange, eerie sensation, as if something wasn't quite right. As if something was missing... Henry had shaken it off, telling himself he was probably imagining things. While still on the road, and while Connie and Richard were sleeping, he and his father had talked about what a stressful time it was, with his mother dying and Wallace having to go overseas. His father had cautioned him to take it easy and not take anything too seriously. Sometimes in stressful situations , he'd said, your perceptions can be clouded or impaired . Things might not always be as they seemed. \"It's a beautiful coast, really, it's almost magical,\" Janice was saying, and then she looked down to the kids' end of the table. \"I'll take you and your siblings there sometime, Henry...\" A groan from Mark briefly interrupted her, but she ignored him and continued talking. \"But these development people, they look at Cannon Beach up in Oregon and Harbor Falls down here in California – eighty thousand visitors in the summer months, spending money left and right. They say, ' Why can't Castel have eighty-thousand people, too?' Because apparently we don't have a big enough beach...\" \"We got huge, two-hundred million year-old rocks instead!\" Jack exclaimed. \"Do you know what they want to do? Blow it all up. Anywhere from forty to sixty tons of dynamite, Wallace. They're going to blast the beach...\" Now Henry could see what his father had meant earlier about getting an earful. \"It'll be great,\" Mark said. \"They ought to dynamite the town, too.\" Henry was a bit more nervous than he'd let on in front of Connie and Richard, and as a result, his ensuing laugh at Mark's sardonic joke was a bit louder than he meant it to be. A quick look from Wallace silenced him. \"Anyone who stands to make a dollar is all for it,\" Janice said. \"But the rest of us who don't want the fast food and retail chains moving in around here are fighting largely for our sanity.\" Maggie looked down the table at Henry. \"You're all going to hear a lot about our beach issue,\" she said. \"It's so boring, Mom,\" Chloe whined. Janice now noticed that Chloe was picking up the broccoli with her fingers. Even Richard was using his 'utensils', albeit with Henry's help. \"Use your fork, Chloe,\" Janice said. \"But my fingers get more,\" Chloe protested. \"Keep it up and they won't be getting any ice cream or pie after dinner, either,\" Janice replied. Henry sliced himself a piece of pork and began to chew it before helping Richard with his food. He sort of liked the way Janice could be strict and make a little joke at the same time. He also liked her style and instinctively trusted her. She reminded Henry of his own mother in some ways, too. He glanced again at Maggie Goldblum, wondering where she would fit in to all this. Thump! Suddenly Henry felt a sharp, throbbing pain in his left shin. It was the kind of pain he'd felt once when he ran into the edge of a heavy glass coffee table; or, to a lesser extent, from when he broke his right leg two years ago. He quietly lowered his fork and stared at Mark, who stared right back with an innocent, open look. Henry knew he might have looked innocent, but Mark was the only one sitting close enough to deliver a kick like that. Well, he wasn't about to let him get away with it. Keeping a casual face, Henry swung his left leg and connected with Mark's right shin. He thought Mark might at least grunt or even start a fight, but the kid just closed his eyes for a second as if he were letting the pain wash through him. Then, oddly enough, he smiled. Henry was surprised at his cousin's reaction, but he smiled back nonetheless. He felt as if he'd just passed a test. He'd proven he could withstand the pain. They were now even. Even better, it was their secret. Mark started to giggle. Henry watched him uncertainly, and then began to giggle as well. As the pain continued to diminish, it did seem a little funny. Here at this fancy table with these adults, they'd both delivered hard kicks to each other's shins and no one had even noticed! Well, Connie and Richard had, but neither of them paid any heed and just kept on eating. \"There must be a lot of money behind this whole thing,\" Wallace said, his interest now somewhat piqued by the beach issue. \"What do you think you can do about it?\" he asked. Janice eagerly delved further into her area of expertise. \"We're organizing public meetings – the occasional rally down on the beach, for example, talking to friendly politicians, getting signatures through online and paper petitions, and coordinating lawyers, naturalists, and engineers who are giving their services for free. Half of the time when we're not working, we're out on this at night.\" \"You too, Jack?\" Wallace asked. Jack nodded and smiled wryly. \"Yeah, I got dragged in, too. She's a real bully. Now I'm campaign secretary. Somehow, it seems as if I'm the only person between here and Washington State who can write a letter or an email.\" \"Hon, you're the only one who can spell everything right,\" Janice said with a laugh. As the giggles from Mark and Henry began to grow louder, Maggie took notice and put her hand on Wallace's shoulder. \"I think they're going to be just fine here, Wallace,\" she said in a low voice. Wallace nodded, a slight smile on his face. He'd been concerned how his sons and daughter would get along with Mark and Chloe, but it was becoming obvious that he had little to worry about. Henry and Mark seemed to be getting along very well. He had no doubt that everyone would settle in in their own way. Once dinner was over and everyone had had their fill of ice cream and Janice's delicious apple crumb pie for dessert, they all made their way out to the living room and sat in a semi-circle on the chairs and sofas that faced the baby grand piano. The living room was open and extremely spacious; a set of completely filled bookshelves was in the far corner by, what Henry presumed, were this house's very common floor-to-ceiling windows. There was also a large aquarium that made up part of one of the walls, filled with all kinds of tropical fish, and a half-dozen indoor plants scattered about the room. Richard had stared at the aquarium in rapt fascination for a time before Henry had refocused his attention on the matter at hand: Chloe's piano piece. For her age, Chloe was quite adept, albeit with some gentle guiding from Janice, and not without a few mistakes here and there. The piece was something Henry had heard in school countless times, but he had never quite been able to put a name to it. Once she had finished, Chloe curtseyed to the applause of everyone – everyone except her brother, that is. Mark was looking utterly bored. Wallace glanced down at his watch and grimaced. Then he cast a look at Henry and spoke aloud. \"I'm afraid it's about that time,\" he said, largely directed at his own children. Henry nodded, his mood now considerably subdued. \"You sure you can't stay any longer, Wallace?\" Jack asked. \"Unfortunately not,\" Wallace replied, rising from his chair. He and the kids then donned their coats and headed back outside to the van. It was growing dark and turning somewhat chilly, but the kids all felt warmed by the meal they'd had. They utterly hated the thought of their father leaving. Richard already looked a bit scared. Henry then asked what they were all thinking. \"You sure you have to go tonight? Can't you at least stay 'til morning?\" \"My plane leaves San Francisco at eight a.m.,\" his father replied. \"I've got to drive down to there tonight and stay in a hotel, time permitting. Believe me, Henry. I'd stay here if I could.\" Henry nodded quietly. They reached the van, and their father opened the door. But instead of getting in, he crouched down until he met his children at eye level. \"You all understand why I have to go, don't you?\" Wallace asked. They just shrugged or nodded silently. Their faces were all somber as Wallace pulled them close. \"I'm leaving you guys now... so that I'll never have to leave you again,\" Wallace said. \"I'll be gone two, maybe three weeks at most. Who knows, maybe less.\" Richard buried his face in Wallace's coat, while Connie looked away and into the growing darkness. Henry knew that their father had to go to Hong Kong to save his business. They'd all known for the better part of a week. The thing was, when it came right down to it, none of them wanted their father to leave. Not now, not ever. \"You're all worried I'm going to leave and not come back,\" Wallace guessed. He'd seen the look in their eyes. \"You're worried you're going to be left with no one.\" Connie nodded. \"Like what if your plane crashes or something?\" she asked. \"Planes don't crash very often,\" Wallace said. \"There are literally thousands of flights every day, and that's just in the United States.\" \"But with our luck...\" Henry couldn't help muttering. \"They say lightning never strikes the same place twice, Henry. I know it's hard, but we've got to start looking toward the future.\" \"Sure,\" Henry said halfheartedly. \"Something else bothering you?\" Wallace asked. \"What's with the Maggie lady?\" Wallace nodded slowly as if he'd expected the question. \"She's a psychologist.\" Henry cocked his head and shrugged. \"So?\" \"So, with me being gone at such a critical time, Janice and I thought it might be a good idea if you and your sibs had someone you could talk to,\" Wallace explained. After meeting Maggie and speaking with her, Wallace had come around to Janice's way of thinking. Maggie impressed him as a caring and sympathetic person who would be a good ear for Henry. Maybe Connie and Richard, too. \"But I don't even know her,\" Henry said. \"None of us do.\" Wallace couldn't help smiling a little. \"Sometimes that makes it easier.\" It might have seemed that way to Wallace , but not to Henry. \"Well, I can't speak for Connie and Rich, but I think I'd rather talk to you.\" \"That's not so easy,\" Wallace said. \"The time difference. When it's day here, it's almost night there.\" \"Then I'll wait until you get back,\" Henry said firmly. \"Henry, please believe me, going to see Maggie won't be such a big deal.\" But the thought shocked Henry. \"I actually have to go see her?\" \"Well, sure.\" It was becoming painfully obvious to Wallace that he had assumed too much about his eldest. \"Where? At her office?\" \"She has the office in her house,\" Wallace said. \"But it's not like going to the doctor. I mean, she's not going to give you a shot or anything.\" \"But I still have to talk to her,\" Henry said. Sure, it probably wouldn't be as bad as getting a shot, but it was darn close. \"You can do whatever you're comfortable doing,\" his father said. \"If you want to go in there and just stare at her for forty-five minutes, do it. But it would make me feel better knowing that you were actually going to go.\" Henry rolled his eyes. \"Hey, come on, you.\" Wallace forced a smile onto his face. \"Cheer up. It's winter break . Except for Henry going to see Maggie, you guys don't have to do anything but play with Mark and Chloe and have a great time until I get back,\" he said encouragingly. Henry knew that their father was only trying to make them feel better. It wouldn't do any good to make them feel worse. Besides, it was getting cold, and Richard was starting to shiver. That, and, Henry's hands were starting to feel cold. He'd always had poor circulation, and that was why he always wore gloves and thermal socks back in Maine whenever the temperate dipped below fifty degrees. \"Hey, listen,\" Wallace said. \"You guys are going to be okay. You know how I know?\" They all shook their heads. \"I know because I believe in my children,\" Wallace said. Henry and Connie nodded in reply and Richard shivered some more. Wallace saw that his youngest son was cold. He rubbed the material of Richard's jacket between his fingers. \"You okay, there, buddy?\" he asked. Richard nodded, but Wallace rubbed the boy's arms and shoulders anyway. \"It may not feel like it right now, but this is probably gonna be too warm for around here,\" he said. \"It's okay, Dad, really,\" Henry said. \"Aunt Janice said we could all borrow some of Mark and Chloe's stuff.\" Wallace sighed and felt a little disappointed in himself. \"Guess I won't be winning any Father of the Year Awards, will I?\" Henry and Connie both hated to see their father get down on himself, as did Richard to a lesser extent , but only because of his age. \"It's not your fault, Dad,\" Connie reassured Wallace. \"You're trying your best,\" Henry said. Wallace nodded, still not entirely certain as to the validity of that statement. Then he suddenly remembered something else. He reached into one of his inner jacket pockets and produced a gleaming new black and gray touchphone. \"I got this a couple months ago, thought I'd give it to you for Christmas. But now...\" He handed the phone to Henry, and the touch display came alive with a burst of light. Connie and Richard pressed in closer and all three kids looked down at it in wonder for a split second before looking back up to their father. \"Really?\" Henry asked. Wallace nodded again. \"Well, it's a share phone for all three of you, but Henry's in charge of it. I've already programmed in my cell number and that of the hotel I'll be staying at. So if you guys need anything, just call.\" Henry pocketed the phone. Then he threw his arms around his father's neck. \"I love you, Dad.\" \"That's right,\" Wallace said, hugging him back and fighting to keep the tears from his eyes. \"Make it worse.\" \"I didn't mean to.\" Henry tightened his hug, not wanting to let go of his father. Not wanting him, Connie, or Richard to see how close to crying he was. \"We'll be together again real soon,\" Wallace whispered. \"I'll be back before you all know it, I promise.\" He slowly worked his way out of his son's embrace and repeated the process with Connie and Richard. Wallace then slid into the van and pulled the door closed behind him. He looked one last time at his children. Then Wallace started the engine and began coasting slowly down the driveway. The kids watched the van roll away. \"Goodbye, Dad,\" they whispered as one. They didn't begin to move until the red taillights had at last vanished from sight. Only then did they turn and look back at the house. The front door was open and framed in the warm, friendly light was Janice, waiting for them. Henry trudged across the driveway, letting Connie and Richard go in ahead of him. They each shared a brief smile with Janice as she ushered them inside and shut the door against the wind.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 - Mark December 12 Henry watched TV with Connie, Richard, Mark and Chloe that night. Perhaps because she wanted them to feel comfortable, or because school was out until after New Years', Janice let them stay up late. Eventually, Mark got bored and invited Henry upstairs to his room, leaving Connie, Richard, and Chloe sprawled out on the sofas in the living room, watching cartoons, already half-asleep. Richard was totally out of it and sleeping on Connie's shoulder. As Henry followed Mark up the stairs, all the while lugging his duffel and computer bags, he caught sight of a row of framed pictures on the wall. The first he recognized as his grandparents – his father and Jack's parents – Dan and Amy Evans, the second and third as slightly younger-looking photos of Jack and Janice, while the last two were of Mark and Chloe, also looking slightly younger. Beyond that, there were no more photographs, but Henry could see a nail in the wall, where a sixth might have hung. \"Hey Mark?\" Henry asked. \"Yeah?\" \"There used to be another picture here, or something?\" Mark stopped and jumped down a couple of steps to get a closer look. He squinted and then seemed to realize just what Henry was talking about. \"Oh, that.\" Mark looked thoughtful. \"That was a photo of my kid brother, Matthew. He drowned in the bathtub three years ago. Having it here reminded my parents, especially my mom, of him too much, and they took it down. It's probably collecting dust in the basement now.\" Henry started. \"My God. That's awful.\" His cousin nodded and then continued up the stairs, Henry trudging along behind him. When they reached Mark's room, the light inside was off. But with a flick of the wrist, Mark threw the switch and a half-dozen wall-mounted lamps burst to life. Henry gaped as he walked in. He'd never seen quite anything like it. Tall, open wooden shelves that looked hand-crafted lined an entire wall and held all kinds of hunting equipment, from an old, well-used airsoft gun to a rack of specialized knives. Then there were smaller shelves, untidy and overflowing with books, some of them virtually new, and others yellowed by age. A pair of ghillie suits – one of them presumably Mark's – hung from the closet door, where there were also posters of a voodoo rite and a regional totem pole. But what really caught Henry's eye was a gleaming silver sword with a black hilt in a glass case, the curved, sharpened edge facing upward. It took up an entire shelf on its own. Mark saw what he was looking at. \"It's a katana , a Japanese samurai sword. Well, samurai used to use 'em – as far back as the 12th century, too,\" he said before launching into an explanation. \"Back in World War II, a lot of katana, old and new, were remounted or forged using non-traditional methods for mass use by the Japanese military. They still make them, but even these days there's restrictions. That's why they're so expensive.\" \"Really?\" Henry asked. He was clearly intrigued. \"How much?\" Mark shrugged. \"Easily a couple thousand bucks.\" Henry whistled. \"How'd you get it?\" \"My dad bought it on his business trip to Tokyo last year. Went to one of the best swordsmiths in Japan, he tells me.\" Henry nodded and continued looking around the room. Along another wall was a workbench covered in tools, scraps of wood, and partially dismantled electronics, namely an old desktop computer/monitor set. Above the workbench hung an old crossbow and two more, newer airsoft guns, their barrels crossed. In another corner of the room was a fully-equipped computer desk, with a state-of-the-art sound system and a small, laptop-style PC. Some of the more normal things Henry saw were movie posters – namely Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , The Hunt for Red October , Hogan's Heroes , and The Awakening – that filled the empty spaces on the wall. But if there was a singular theme to the room, it was combat. \"Wow.\" \"I know, right?\" Mark said, beaming at Henry. Henry finally dropped his bags on the floor. They had been getting heavy. \"Top or bottom?\" he asked. He hadn't noticed before: Mark had a bunk bed. Mark plopped down on the bottom bunk and then patted the top one with his hand. \"Have a seat.\" Henry gratefully scrambled up the ladder and dropped onto the bed. That was when he again caught sight of Mark's computer. It was smaller than his for sure, but not a whole lot thinner. Mark also chose that moment to retrieve it from the desk and demonstrate it to Henry. He opened it, his fingers dancing deftly across the keys, clearly honed by years of practice. Okay , Henry thought, not too much different than mine, just smaller . But then Mark surprised him yet again by detaching the screen from the keyboard. Henry's eyes bugged out of his head, while Mark grinned. \"A tabtop?\" Henry asked as he dropped to the floor, incredulous. Mark nodded and sat beside Henry on the bottom bunk. His index finger swiped across the screen, bringing up a highly customized desktop. Henry whistled, clearly impressed by the layout. Then Mark opened his MP3 playlist and began scrolling through it. \"Music. A ton of it, too. I've got several gigs-worth on here. But music's the least of what this baby can do.\" Henry spied something familiar as the playlist scrolled by. Was that... No, it couldn't be. He pointed. \" California Upstart ?\" Mark's face split into a huge grin. \"You too?\" \"Yeah, man,\" Henry replied, barely able to contain his excitement. \"Which song's your favorite?\" \" Hydro all the way. You?\" \" Fallen Away ,\" Henry said. \"I listened to all six songs for a while on the road back East.\" \"What'd you listen to 'em on?\" Henry rummaged around in his computer bag and subsequently produced his CD player. It seemed old compared to Mark's tabtop. Mark grinned and nodded in approval. \"Old style portable CD player. I like.\" \"Yeah,\" Henry said, \"Trouble is it likes to skip with the tiniest scratch on one of the discs. Fortunately, this one hasn't yet. That and I'm glad permanent marker doesn't affect burned CDs.\" \"Who do you think CU 's guys are, anyway?\" Mark asked as he went to put the computer back. \"Who knows?\" Henry asked, shrugging. \"For one thing, they're definitely not our age.\" Mark looked puzzled. \"How can you tell?\" \"For one thing, they'd sound all high-pitched and girly,\" Henry said, laughing. Mark smiled and laughed, too. At that moment, Janice poked her head in the door, smiling at the laughter. \"I hate to quash your excitement, guys, but you should probably get ready for bed.\" \"Sure thing, Mom,\" Mark said. Henry nodded to Janice. Mark's mother smiled at them before leaving the room. \"Goodnight, guys.\" \"'Night, Mom!\" Mark called after her. Then he turned to Henry. \"Feel like hitting the hay, cuz?\" Now that Henry thought about it, he really was tired. He nodded in agreement. Henry wasn't even certain he remembered the lights going out. The next morning, he woke up in a strange room half-filled with morning sunlight. For a moment, he sat up and looked around, not at all sure where he was. Then it came to him: he was in Mark's room. But where was Mark? Henry leaned out over the rail and looked around. Oh, wait. There he was. Mark was still asleep, sprawled across the bottom bunk, lying on his back, sheets and blankets twisted around him. Fortunately, he wasn't snoring, but he was breathing with his mouth wide open, drooling on his pillow. Henry suppressed an urge to laugh, and instead decided this was too good an opportunity to pass up. Touchphones did have cameras after all, atop their mildly pricy Internet connections, didn't they? Henry quietly slipped down to the floor, retrieved his phone from the nearby nightstand, and unplugged it. He turned it on, thankful he'd decided on 'silent mode' last night, and activated the camera. \"Say cheese,\" Henry whispered. The phone clicked and the camera lens flashed for a split second. Henry had it, and the photo would be priceless. Then he set the phone back down on the nightstand and leaned in over his cousin's bunk. \"You're dead...\" Mark muttered groggily, his eyes flickering open. Henry backed away and sat in the desk chair, grinning deviously. \"Couldn't help myself,\" he said with a shrug. Mark yawned and sat up. \"What time is it?\" \"About 6:45,\" Henry replied, taking a quick glance down at his phone. \"Though I'm more used to getting up around 9:45.\" \"9:45?\" Henry just shrugged. \"Maine. East Coast. You know.\" Mark snorted. \"That's gonna be your excuse for a lot of stuff the next couple weeks, isn't it?\" Henry shrugged yet again. \"Why not?\" And that was when he caught a whiff of something delicious. \"What's that?\" Henry asked, sniffing the air. \"That...\" Mark said as he slipped out of his bed, \"Will be my Mom's pancakes. And with any luck, bacon, too.\" Henry's face broke into a huge grin. \"Sweet!\" He hadn't had a breakfast like that in a long time. They both quickly changed into day clothes and breezed out of the room within five minutes. But just as they reached the top of the stairs, Henry saw something out of the corner of his eye that quickly grabbed his attention. He stopped and walked over to a door that was slightly ajar and peered inside. There, he saw a small child's bed, a bookcase filled with oversized picture books, and big plastic toys a toddler might play with. But what was so arresting about the room was how neat and untouched it was. Everything looked exactly how it should have been. Then Henry remembered whose it was. \"Matthew.\" Henry turned to see Mark, having suddenly appeared behind him. \"What?\" \"It was Matthew's room,\" Mark said, almost nonchalantly. \"Why's everything still here?\" Henry asked. \"I thought they took the photo down because it reminded your parents of him too much. If that's the case, then...\" \"Why do they still keep all his stuff out in his room?\" Mark said, finishing the sentence. He shrugged. \"No idea. Just one of those adult/parent things, I guess. Now c'mon, let's get downstairs before Chloe and your sibs eat all the pancakes.\" Henry turned away from the room and followed Mark down the stairs, taking them two at a time, their footfalls thudding on the carpet. They both burst into the kitchen at full tilt, skidding to a halt just before running into the table. \"Slow down you two!\" Janice said, smiling at them from her place at the table, a mug of steaming coffee in her hands. \"The food's not going anywhere. Help yourselves.\" Mark handed Henry a plate and began piling his with pancakes and bacon. Henry just stared at the food in wonder. Janice saw his expression and recognized it from Wallace's look at the roast during dinner last night. \"Haven't had a homemade breakfast in a while, have you, Henry?\" she asked. Henry nodded vigorously and quickly followed Mark's example. \"Well, get used to it,\" Janice said with a smile. As Henry poured himself a glass of orange juice, he began looking for the syrup. But there wasn't any. Then Janice passed him an opaque glass jar with a handle on it. Henry's eyes grew wide. He recognized this. \"Vermont maple syrup?\" he asked. Janice nodded. \"Wow,\" Henry said. \"I didn't think most people outside the Northeast used the real stuff.\" \"You're right. Most people don't. But your Uncle Jack grew up on it, and he got me into it after were married. That, and once I knew you, Connie, and Richard were coming out here, I bought some on my last trip to the store. I know how much your whole family likes it.\" Henry poured it over his pancakes and took a bite. Just as good as he remembered. \"Well?\" Janice asked eagerly. \"It's great. Thanks. I haven't tasted it in a long time.\" Janice held her gaze on him, and even from across the table, Henry felt as if she was hovering. When adults did that, it bothered him sometimes, but he had to admit there was something a little soothing in knowing someone cared about him. Then she got up, sat down beside him, and took his hand. She looked right into his eyes. \"Everything's going to be okay, Henry,\" she said in a comforting and soothing voice. \"You'll see.\" Instead of awkwardly looking away, Henry looked right back at Janice, right into her eyes. Just as they had the afternoon before, he felt an odd sense of kinship with her. The clatter of a fork on a plate interrupted his thoughts, and he saw Mark rise from the table, wiping his face with a blue cloth napkin. \"Hey, Henry, I've got something outside that I wanna show ya,\" Mark said. Henry looked back at Janice, who smiled and nodded. \"So much for breakfast,\" she said with a wink at Henry. \"I'll see you two at lunch.\" \"Thanks,\" Henry said. But just as he was about to leave, he turned back to Janice, a question practically written on his face. \"You said I could borrow one of Mark's jackets, right?\" Janice nodded, sipping at her coffee. \"There should be a dark green windbreaker on the far right of the coat rack by the front door. You can use that one.\" \"Thanks again.\" He jogged out into the entryway and narrowly avoided getting trampled by Connie and Richard as they bounded down the stairs. \"Whoa! Slow down, guys! There's still plenty of food for you. Have a good sleep?\" he asked. \"Yup!\" Richard said, eagerly bouncing on his feet. Connie nodded. \"You think we're gonna have some fun here?\" Henry asked. \"Sure do!\" Richard exclaimed. \"Definitely,\" Connie said. \"Chloe's really nice, and I love her room.\" \"That's great,\" Henry said, smiling broadly at them. \"Now go on and eat some good breakfast for once. Don't let me stop you.\" They eagerly ran off into the kitchen. Henry slipped on his boots and his borrowed jacket. He was halfway to the door before Janice called out his name. \"Henry!\" \"Aunt Janice?\" Janice strode out of the kitchen. \"Please. I'm not too big on formality with kids your age, Henry. Just call me Janice.\" \"OK. You want something?\" Henry asked. \"Oh, yes.\" Janice held something out to him and he took it. It was a slightly worn baseball glove. \"Mark wanted me to make sure you had this before going outside.\" \"Thanks.\" Janice stood in front of him and gave him a kind look. \"Are you all right to share with Mark? You could always have your own room, if you want. Just say the word. But I did think it might be more fun for you guys to share the bunk bed.\" \"I'm fine,\" Henry said, shrugging. \"You know, it's bound to be a bit strange for all of you these first few days. Don't be afraid to complain. I'm always open to constructive criticism.\" Henry nodded. \"I'm okay.\" \"And... if there's anything special that any of you want to eat...\" Henry shrugged again. \"As long as everything's as good as last night and this morning, I definitely won't have any problems. That goes for Connie and Rich, too.\" \"Well then, Mark's probably waiting for you. And watch out,\" Janice said playfully as she made her way back toward the kitchen. \"He's got a wicked curveball.\" Henry was soon out the front door and into the yard. The sun was poking through gaps in the clouds, a light breeze was blowing and the air was damp and cool. But where was Mark? \"Henry! Think fast!\" Suddenly something was sailing through the air towards him. Right at his face. Even with the reflexes of a minor athlete, Henry barely had time to put his hands up. Smack! A baseball slammed into the outstretched glove on his right hand. If Henry hadn't put it up when he did, the ball would've smashed into his face. Henry gripped the ball in the glove and looked around for his cousin. His sense of surprise was quickly turning into one of anger. Standing out in the middle of the yard was Mark, wearing a denim jacket over a maroon sweatshirt and jeans, with a backwards-facing ball cap on his head. He looked pleased with Henry. \"Hey, there! Great catch!\" he shouted, and then started to wave. \"Come on, hit me!\" Henry promptly heaved the ball back at Mark with a burst of strength. It sailed hard and low. \"Ooof!\" Mark gasped as he gathered it into his stomach with his bare hands. There was a split second where the boy grimaced, and while Henry waited to see if his cousin would get angry, but he seemed delighted and quickly waved Henry to go out for another catch. Henry started to run. It was like the kick the night before. Like some kind of test where he had to prove himself. Mark threw the baseball. Henry caught it far more easily this time, and tossed it back. Once again, the anger quickly faded. Tossing the ball back and forth, they made their way across the yard toward the nearby woods. As they entered a gap in the huge trees, Mark laid the baseball down on a nearby stump and waved for Henry to join him. \"I want to show you something,\" he said. They started up a surprisingly well-cleared dirt path into the woods. It was swept clean of leaves, twigs, or anything else for that matter, almost like someone had vacuumed the ground. Henry jogged alongside Mark, feeling good that he'd proved himself capable with a baseball, and that Mark thought he was important enough to want to show him things. \"What is it?\" Henry asked. \"You'll see.\" They suddenly stopped at the base of an enormous tree. Henry had never seen one so wide at the base or so tall. It practically soared into the sky. California did have some of the biggest trees in the country, after all, if not the biggest. Hammered into the trunk in somewhat uneven rows were cut-down two-by-fours, intended to serve as a makeshift ladder of sorts until a climber could reach the first branches. Lying on the ground nearby was a small bundle of planks wrapped and tied in a canvas tarp, and a metal bucket, holding a saw, a hammer, and a whole lot of loose nails. \"You any good at climbing trees?\" Mark asked. \"I'm OK,\" Henry said. \"Good.\" Mark pointed upward. \"See up there?\" Henry looked. Through the branches he could see something in the upper reaches of the tree. It looked like a small platform. He had once toyed with the idea of his own treehouse in the old elm back home, but school, basketball, and his mother had put that on indefinite hold. But Mark had actually gone and done it. He turned back to Mark, who was tying a length of cord around the bundle of planks. Then Mark slung the canvas wrapped planks over his shoulder, and tied off yet another length of rope around his waist so that they wouldn't slip. He finally grabbed the first steps and started to climb, the planks thudding against his back. \"I need some help up there,\" he said. \"Can you get the hammer and nails and put them in your pockets?\" Henry pocketed the hammer and as many nails as he could and watched his cousin climb the makeshift ladder. Given a choice, he would have rather stayed on the ground. When Mark reached the lowest branches at roughly fifty feet, or a fourth of the way up, he briefly stopped and called back down, \"Aren't you coming?\" Henry swallowed. It was another test. The last thing he wanted to do was to appear chicken. \"Sure,\" he responded, careful to hide the uncertainty in his voice. He stepped to the base of the tree, reached for one of the first two-by-fours and started to climb. Truth be told, he was nervous. Probably another good reason he'd shelved the idea of his own treehouse back home. Henry soon reached the branches and kept on climbing. It wasn't as hard as he'd imagined. The branches were pretty evenly spaced, and where there wasn't one, Mark had hammered in another two-by-four to serve as a step. Suddenly, he stopped and looked down, surprised at how high up he was. A stack of wood near the base of the tree looked hardly any bigger than Lincoln Logs. Above him, Mark had reached the platform and now lay on his stomach, looking over the edge back down at him. A few minutes later, Henry finally reached the branches just below the platform. He grabbed a branch and planted his foot on another, slightly smaller one that looked sturdy enough to support him. He was just about to pull himself up onto the platform when a loud crack! suddenly echoed through the air and the branch supporting his feet gave way. I'm falling! For one utterly terrifying second, Henry was certain he was going to die. In a desperate attempt to save himself, he threw up his hands to grab for something, anything. Just as suddenly, he felt two hands lock onto his wrists. He stared up and found Mark above him, arms extended down over the edge of the platform, holding him. His cousin was the only thing standing between Henry and certain death below. Henry's heart was beating so fast, he could feel it all over his body. Adrenaline and fear raced through him. He looked up into Mark's face, but the smile he was now used to seeing was gone. Mark gazed back at him with an empty, almost disinterested look. Henry grunted with effort and kicked his feet wildly, trying to find another branch. Looking down for another foothold on which to gain purchase, he saw for the first time just how sickeningly high up in the air he was. Even the old elm back home couldn't hold a candle to this tree. In a flash, Henry's head snapped back up as he stared pleadingly into his cousin's eyes. Then Mark's lips began to move. \"I could always let you go. If I did, do you think you could fly?\" What kind of a question was that?! \"No one would know,\" Mark added. He had to be joking, but at the moment, Henry was so terrified he simply couldn't get an answer out of his throat, even if he'd wanted to. He was completely at his cousin's mercy. The idea that Mark would let go was inconceivable, yet, at the same time, so terrifying that Henry wanted to yell out. Just then, Mark finally pulled him up after what seemed an eternity. Henry managed to get his hands on the edge of the platform, and though his legs were still swinging freely beneath him, as he pulled himself up, Henry could feel Mark grab his shoulders and help. A moment later, he pulled Henry up onto the platform, and they both lay sprawled on their backs, gasping for breath. Henry's heart pounded, the blood rushing in his ears, his whole body nervous with adrenaline. He couldn't believe how close he'd come. He didn't know what to think about Mark just letting him hang there and asking that crazy question. Once again, it made him feel angry, but when he looked over to Mark, the boy gave that charming smile. Then he began to laugh and took a swipe at Henry's knee, as if it had all just been a big joke. There was something infectious about that laugh, and soon Henry found himself laughing as well. He wasn't really sure it was all that funny. Maybe it was simply the relief of knowing he was safe. Or maybe he was laughing because he wanted to be accepted. \"But I didn't, did I?\" Mark said confidently. After a few moments, he rolled onto his knees and began to unwrap the bundle of planks he'd carried up. Henry rose to his feet and looked around. The view really was spectacular: the tops of trees surrounded them, and in the distance, he could see the tall white shape of a lighthouse, and a valley snaking through the rocky, tree-covered hills off to the east. When he turned to the west, Henry saw the ocean spread out before him, huge, blue, and endless. Henry took in a deep breath, as if inhaling the fresh, clean, northern California air for the first time. It was very different from Maine. He really thought he could come to like it here. \"You still got that hammer and those nails?\" Henry turned around. \"What?\" Mark waved him over. He was holding a plank against the trunk. Henry now saw that the reason Mark had carried the planks up was to expand the size of the platform. \"Is this going to be an observation platform?\" Henry asked as he steadied a nail and hit it with the hammer, driving it into the trunk beneath. \"A treehouse,\" Mark replied. That was what he'd figured, but it didn't hurt to ask. \"With walls?\" Henry asked. \"Walls, windows, a second floor, a roof, and a door if I have enough wood,\" Mark said. It seemed like quite an ambitious project to Henry. He might have doubted his cousin could actually do it, but he checked himself, remembering the workbench in Mark's room. It seemed as if Mark was quite capable of working with his hands. It took another ten or fifteen minutes to finish hammering the planks Mark had carried up. They stood back to admire their work. It was a good start on the second floor. They now sat down against the trunk to rest. \"You know,\" Mark said, \"I'm kinda glad you showed up. Even though I have to share my room with you.\" \"I could always take one of the other rooms,\" Henry offered, remembering what Janice had said earlier. \"Mom thinks that you'd be lonely,\" Mark said. Henry shook his head. \"Nah, I've still got Connie and Rich. We always hang out together.\" \"Really?\" Mark asked, his face a surprising mixture of jealousy and disinterest. Henry nodded. \"Yeah.\" \"Look, I don't care that you're in my room. Just don't meddle with my stuff unless I give the say so.\" He got a raised eyebrow from Henry. Mark continued. \"What I'm trying to say is that I'm glad you're here. Some things are a lot more fun when there's two people around instead of just one.\" \"Yeah? Like what?\" Henry asked. Mark lowered his voice, but ever so slightly. \"There's something I need your help with. Something amazing – truly amazing. But it's a secret.\" \"You can trust me,\" Henry said, a hint of eagerness in his voice. \"It's not ready yet, though. Maybe in another couple of days.\" Mark then got up and unwound a crank bolted to a heavy branch above, unspooling a length of rope out over the side of the platform until it dangled just above the dirt below. Then he locked the crank into position and climbed onto the rope, where he abruptly paused. \"There is another thing. Do you like explosions?\" Mark asked. Henry nodded, thinking back to the countless movies and TV shows he'd seen with some form of explosion or another in them. \"Yeah. They're great.\" Mark gave him a nod of approval. \"Good.\" Then he began sliding down the rope. Henry waited a second and followed him. Fortunately, it was a clear drop to the ground. When he got there, Henry saw that Chloe had arrived. Mark had started chasing his sister and was shouting at her. \"Chloe, drop that! Drop that right now! I mean it!\" \"But I'm not hurting it!\" Chloe yelled back at him, clutching the baseball in her hands. Henry started to follow them, and then he noticed the branch that had broken under his weight and almost cost him his life not twenty minutes ago. He picked it up and looked it over. Oddly enough, it appeared that part of it had been cut through cleanly, as if with a saw. No wonder it had snapped so quickly. Henry heard another shout and looked up, tossing the branch – and the thought – aside. Mark had caught up with Chloe and was holding her tightly as he pried the baseball out of her hands. \"I don't care what you're doing!\" he shouted angrily. \"I gave you a simple rule to obey, okay? If I've told you once, I've told you another thousand times: You never, ever, EVER touch any of my things. Whatever it is, if it's mine, you don't even think of touching it. Get it now?\" The ball fell from Chloe's hands and rolled into the grass, but Mark continued to clamp down on her wrists and wouldn't let go. \"I just hope that's not too difficult for someone like you to understand,\" he said in a sarcastic and condescending tone. \"Stop!\" she cried out. \"You're hurting me. Let go! Mom! MOM! \" Mark finally let go, and Chloe ran off toward the house, tears streaming from her face. Her brother picked the baseball back up and began impatiently tossing it into the air. Henry watched on as he strode slowly toward his older cousin, somewhat shocked by what he'd just seen. Mark had seemed a bit cruel toward his little sister. Apparently, he was very possessive when it came to his things. Not ten minutes later, that was all forgotten. Now the two boys were deep into the woods, in a large clearing, and emptying plastic garbage bags of dead leaves onto the ground, creating a pile that was taller than either of them. Once they were done, Mark got on all fours and adjusted something at the base of the pile. Then he leapt to his feet. \"OK! That's got it. Run!\" They both dashed away and moved behind the cover of a tree. For a few seconds, there was nothing but the sound of their breathing. And then a miniature thunderclap echoed through the woods, and the pile of leaves erupted in a flash of smoke, spewing them high into the air. \"Yeah!\" Mark let out a whoop and led Henry back into the clearing, where the leaves were raining down like snow. They both laughed and leapt through the storm of leaves. It was an oddly triumphant and exhilarating moment, even to Henry. He'd never done anything like this back home. He'd never done anything like this, period. For lunch, Janice had made grilled cheese, both plain and optionally with bacon. Henry chose one of each, as did Mark. There was also tomato soup to dip them in. Henry knew he was definitely going to enjoy the food while he was here. Hopefully Connie and Richard would, too. His own cooking had left a lot to be desired. He was pretty certain that Chloe had told her mother about what Mark had done earlier, but if Janice was angry about it, she didn't let it show at all. Once lunch was over, Mark wanted to go back outside again, this time to head into town. Just as they were heading down the walk, Janice came out onto the tiny front stoop. She was buttoning up an overcoat and had an underlying tone of eagerness to her voice. \"Where are you boys off to now?\" she asked. \"Just out, okay?\" Mark said curtly. His tone was cold. \"Want to walk down to the point with me? The one by the beach. We could show Henry...\" Mark cut her off. \"We're busy. C'mon, Henry.\" He started toward the driveway and turned briefly, waving to his cousin. \"C'mon!\" Embarrassed to be so blithely dismissing Janice, but not wanting to reject what Mark now had in mind, Henry held an awkward gaze on his aunt for a few seconds longer – catching her disappointed look in the process – and turned to follow Mark toward the main road. A/N: Films in this universe are more frequently based on novels (and stick far closer to their original plotlines). 'The Hunt for Red October' for instance, has a film based on it made in 1988 instead of 1990, and it is far more accurate to the novel. 'Hogan's Heroes' would be a 1990 action film based on the TV series, and 'The Awakening' is this universe's version of 'The Shining', but was written by a completely different, fictional author, and was published in the late '80s, with a film made after it in 1992. 'California Upstart' is a fictional precursor to Linkin Park, with a largely cult following. Touchphones are basically iPhone-style smartphones, but exist as early as the late '80s, as do laptop-tablet hybrids (what I've nicknamed tabtops), thanks to a leap in technology that started in the early 1900s, due in large part to Nikola Tesla.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 - Q&A;/Show And Tell Roughly half an hour later, they reached the outskirts of town and began walking along the main drag toward the waterfront. They soon passed an array of shops, and one of the owners that was out sweeping the sidewalk waved upon recognizing Mark, who promptly returned the gesture. Then they came across Maggie Goldblum, who was carrying a brown paper grocery bag under one arm. \"Morning, boys,\" Maggie said briskly. \"Morning, Miss Goldblum,\" Mark and Henry chorused. \"Having fun this fine day?\" Maggie asked. \"Making mischief?\" Mark nodded vigorously and he grinned impishly. \"Yep.\" Maggie chuckled. \"You sure as hell can't have one without the other. Now, Henry, when are coming to see me? You busy at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?\" Henry shook his head. \"No, ma'am,\" he replied. \"That's settled, then,\" Maggie said, and she kept walking in the opposite direction. \"Don't be late, and don't you go and bring that buzz-headed, brown-haired scallywag with you.\" Mark rolled his eyes at that and they continued on. No sooner had Maggie passed them by than an elderly seaman, dressed in khaki slacks, a red windbreaker and a blue cap pulled down over whitish-gray hair came strolling toward the boys. He also had a scruffy brown terrier walking ahead of him on a leash. \"Hello there, Mark!\" the man called out. He stopped in front of the boys and the dog sat obediently at his heels. \"Is this one of the young'uns that's staying with you?\" he asked. \"Morning, Captain Lawson,\" Mark said, and promptly laid a hand on Henry's shoulder. \"That he is. His name's Henry Evans.\" Henry shook Captain Lawson's hand with a firm grip. \"You're to be congratulated, my friend,\" Captain Lawson said to Henry. \"We have a fine community, and this here's a very special young man. Everyone will tell you that. You've chosen well.\" Henry quickly bent down to pet Lawson's terrier. \"Thank you, sir.\" \"Comet here seems to like you,\" the captain said. \"And he doesn't normally trust strangers.\" \"Well, I guess I'm just the trusting type,\" Henry said with a grin. \"I best be going. Good day, boys.\" And with that, Lawson and his dog went their way. Mark now visibly grimaced at Lawson's praise for him, while Henry barely suppressed a laugh. It instead came out as more of a guttural snigger. As they continued on their way, every now and again, one of them would stoop down and retrieve various pieces of junk from the ground. Such pick-ups ranged from a broken cellphone to rusted screws and bolts, and everything went into a burlap drawstring bag Mark was carrying. The expansive local boatyards were just starting to come into view. The sight was fairly similar to the boatyards back in Rock Harbor: assorted weather-beaten fishing boats with nets, coils of rope, and traps piled on their decks, and even a couple of small dry docks. There were currently some men at work unloading boxes from a trawler and carrying them into an enclosed boatshed. \"Did you see your mom when she was dead?\" Mark suddenly asked. The question was a little personal and somewhat painful, but Henry somehow felt compelled to answer. \"I wanted to, but no one would let me.\" \"I would have made them let me,\" Mark said. \"It's very important.\" \"Who says?\" Henry asked. \"Nobody actually talks about death. That's why you have to investigate it. It's scientific.\" The talk of death and his mother made Henry feel very uncomfortable. \"It doesn't feel like that to me,\" he said, hoping Mark would just drop the subject. Henry didn't like talking about his mother as dead. He didn't like thinking of his mother as dead. \"What did she look like last time you saw her?\" Mark asked. Henry winced visibly and looked into his cousin's eyes as they walked along. Mark looked right back with almost no expression on his face. He wasn't grinning or leering or anything. It just seemed like he was curious. Still, Henry wished he wouldn't talk about it. \"Kind of pale,\" Henry said reluctantly. \" Kind of pale?!\" Mark exclaimed. He sounded surprised. \"When Little Matty drowned in the bathtub, I took a real good look.\" Henry felt his eyes widen in surprise. \"What?!\" \"He was completely blue,\" Mark said. \"You should have looked at your mother's eyes and lips and touched her skin to see what it felt like. You know, hot... cold... dry, or whatever.\" Her eyes? Her lips? Her skin? Without warning, and without wanting to in the least, Henry pictured it for a second. His mother dead. Her open, glassy eyes. Her pale, bloodless lips. No, it was awful, too awful. He hurriedly shoved the thought clear out of his head, furious that Mark would talk of such things. \"Your mom will die one day, too, and then you can get out your tape measure,\" he snapped angrily. \"Leave my mother out of it!\" \"Hey, don't get all mad,\" Mark said, feigning innocence. \"I was just being scientific.\" Henry glared at him. \"Then talk about something else,\" he growled. They had stopped not ten feet from the men unloading the trawler, who were now glancing curiously in their direction. \"And if I don't?\" Mark dared. He wouldn't back down. Henry continued to glare at him. This simply wasn't open for discussion. His mother was off-limits, and wanted to make sure Mark knew that, too. \"If you get all 'scientific' about my mother again, I'll deck you,\" Henry threatened. Mark stared back at him, unwavering. \"I'm pretty strong, brother. Just you try it,\" he said. Several of the dockworkers had stopped what they were doing and watched with interest as the boys squared off against each other. Henry's emotions were now a swirling rage inside him. \"We'll see about that,\" he told Mark. They circled each other, fists raised, and preparing for a fight. They exchanged cold, silent glares that would have stopped anyone else in their tracks. When Henry looked into Mark's eyes, there was something just so still and empty about them. Then Mark suddenly dropped his fists and smiled sheepishly, turning on the charm. \"Hey, look. I'm sorry. That was real stupid of me,\" he said. \"I'm real sorry, Henry. I won't talk that way again, okay?\" Henry gave him a wary look. \"I really am sorry,\" Mark said emphatically. \"Will you forgive me?\" Henry watched as Mark extended his hand. Once again he felt his anger drain away. When Mark smiled and acted friendly like that, it was almost impossible not to like him. Henry unclenched his fists and offered a hand to his cousin. They shook. That earned a few boos and jeers from the workers, as if they had been expecting a real fight. \"G'wan, Mark! Hit him!\" one of them called out. That merely served to cement the boys' reconciliation and they both waved dismissively and went back along the pier. Suddenly Mark darted forward and stooped to the ground. \"Look! Here's two more.\" He dropped another two rusty bolts into his bag and pulled the drawstring closed. \"That should do it. Let's go!\" As they made their way back along the side of the road and toward home, Henry caught sight of Janice standing on a promontory near the beach that jutted out over the ocean, her hair blowing in the wind. He stopped. \"Isn't that your mom?\" Henry asked. Mark stopped, too. \"Yeah, she's always down here. She's really nuts about the place. Really boring, if you ask me. Come on, we've got some work to do.\" Henry cast a final glance at Janice, who was staring blankly out at the ocean, apparently lost in her thoughts. Henry wondered where Mark was going. They had gone back into the woods by the house, but now they were even farther than the clearing where they'd blown up the pile of leaves earlier. The trees here grew even closer together, and the ground was littered with thick layers of dead, brittle leaves, pine needles, and cones that crunched underfoot with every other step. Now he was beginning to wonder if Mark even knew where they were going. Henry barely had time to duck out of the way of a low-hanging pine branch that swiped through his hair, where, a split second earlier, his face had been. \"Whoa!\" \"You all right back there?\" Mark asked. \"Sure...\" Henry replied as he brushed some pine needles from his hair and continued following his cousin deeper into the woods. A couple minutes later, Mark finally stopped in a small, enclosed clearing and took a deep breath that sounded distinctly like a sigh. \"Do you actually know where you're going?\" Henry asked, staring at Mark. Mark gave him a grin and started toward the other side of the clearing. \"You'll see,\" he said. Henry sighed inwardly. Mark and his secrets... Mark suddenly stooped and seemed to lift a section of the ground aside, scattering another pile-worth of leaves. Henry's eyes went wide. His cousin had just exposed a narrow flight of worn and chipped concrete steps that led below ground level and down to a rusted set of double doors chained together with a padlock. What the...? Grinning like a fiend, Mark started down the steps and motioned for Henry to follow. Then he produced a key, undid the padlock, and removed the chains with a loud, metallic rattle. Mark shoved open the doors with both hands, exposing a dark room beyond. A slightly musty smell reached Henry's nose on a draft of cool air. A loud click sounded from behind him as Mark flipped a breaker switch and a string of bare light bulbs along the ceiling suddenly flickered to life. A low hum now filled the air as Henry gazed around the room and recognized what this was: an old bunker, probably World War II vintage, judging by the wear and tear on the concrete. On one wall was the California state flag, and on the other, the Stars and Stripes. Both looked surprisingly new. Canvas tarps lay draped across old folding tables, their contents a mystery to all but Mark, who was now standing beside a square table in the middle of the room. \"You like?\" Mark asked. Henry nodded. \"Found it a few years back when I was taking a walk through here. Darn near broke my ankles, too. Far as I can tell, it was some kind of ammo storage bunker for a nearby artillery battery in World War II. Any munitions are long gone, but it makes a good private workshop. Close the doors and we'll get started.\" A tiny bit of apprehension nagged at him, but his eagerness to find out what Mark had planned was his driving force at the moment. Henry swung the doors shut behind him and wandered over to the table where Mark was standing. Mark whipped the tarp away, revealing what lay beneath. \"Ta-dah!\" he said, taking a slight bow. \"What is it?\" Henry asked. He had never seen anything like it before. \"A pet project,\" Mark replied. \"You know what I mean,\" Henry retorted. Mark grinned and launched into a detailed explanation. \"It's kinda like a catapult. I got the base from an old stove, and it has all these holes that make things easier to mount. Then these two springs are off a big door. You can't even pull them back with your hands 'cause they're too powerful. You have to use this.\" Mark briefly held up a chrome ratchet before continuing. \"It takes a minute to wind them full out. I managed to get one of the guys down at the harbor to weld the springs onto the end of this block. The pin back here is the release mechanism – basically, the trigger. When you pull the pin, it releases the block, which then runs down this groove that I've oiled up.\" Then he laid his hand on a long metal tube atop the contraption. \"And this is the sight. Now, let's try one of those bolts...\" Henry retrieved the bag from the floor and fished around inside it. His hand emerged with several of the rusted bolts. He held up one that looked promising, but Mark shook his head. \"That one's too big,\" he said. Henry held up another. Now Mark nodded in approval. \"That's good... and that other one, too. Now for the big test.\" He hefted the device in one move and started toward the doors, with Henry carrying the bolts and the ratchet. \"Let's shoot it out into the water. Try and hit a rock or something,\" Henry suggested as they made their way out of the bunker and back above ground. \"Are you kidding?!\" Mark exclaimed. \"What a waste! We need a good target.\" Mark walked along slowly, lugging the heavy contraption all the way through the woods and until they came to the edge of the road, which was lined by a low stone wall. They then walked about a hundred yards further before finally stopping. Mark set the device down on the wall, sighing in relief. \"Okay, here,\" he said. Moments later, they were crouched behind the wall as Mark lined up the machine. \"Incredible, huh?\" he asked. \"It took me a long time to find all the parts.\" \"You mean you made this yourself?\" Henry asked incredulously. \"You better believe it, man,\" Mark replied. \"How?\" Henry asked. \"What do you mean, how?\" his cousin asked quizzically. \"Like, did you follow instructions from a manual or the Internet or something?\" Mark grinned. \"Yeah, but they came from up here.\" He tapped his head. It was difficult for Henry to believe that anyone his age could build such a thing out of nothing but spare parts. But he had, nonetheless, and not only that, it appeared to be something original, too. \"You still got that ratchet?\" Mark asked, holding out his hand. \"Yeah. Here.\" Henry pulled it out of his pocket and handed it to him. Mark attached the ratchet to a spot on the side of the device and began to work it back and forth. The ratchet made a clicking sound as Mark worked it back and forth. The catapult part slowly pulled back as the springs stretched and creaked. \"Now, when they're all the way back, you can load the bolts here\" Mark said. Henry slid one into the groove. So that was why they'd collected them. Mark adjusted the contraption, and Henry realized he was aiming at something across the way. Looking over, he saw a cat sitting on a rock on the other side of the road. Mark lined up the device and then pulled the ratchet a few more times until the springs were stretched back as far as they would go. The cat wasn't even aware of them. It was just sitting on top of the rock, contentedly licking its paws and sunning itself at the same time. Henry soon got a funny feeling in the pit of his stomach. \"You're not going to try and hit it, right?\" Henry asked. \"You're just gonna give it a good scare.\" \"Lock and load,\" Mark said. Once again, Mark kneeled behind the device and adjusted its position. \"Let's line it up here... like this...\" he whispered. \"You're not gonna hit it, OK?\" Henry asked in a whisper. Mark then pulled the trigger. In the space of a split second, there was an oily clunk and a high-pitched whine as the springs snapped forward and the device fired. Across the road, just inches above the cat's head, the bolt half-disappeared into the trunk of a large tree. The cat's head shot up at the sudden disturbance. It looked around for a moment, saw nothing to feel threatened by, and went back to cleaning itself. \"Cool!\" Henry shouted. He and Mark hopped over the wall, checked the road for cars, and ran across toward the cat. In a flash, the animal darted and scampered away. The boys reached the tree and stared at the bolt. Henry grabbed the end of the bolt and tried to pull it out. It wouldn't budge. It was embedded far too deep. \"Wow, look at that!\" Henry exclaimed, his mood almost giddy. \"Right in there! That's amazing, Mark. You did it! It's a beauty! And the speed of that thing – I didn't even see it go! I swear you ought to patent this thing.\" Mark stood behind him, quietly surveying the scene. The cat had stopped thirty feet away on the gravel shoulder and was staring back at them. \"The scope's not right yet,\" Mark said, shaking his head in disgust. Henry looked up at him and followed his eyes to the cat. \"You're kidding, right?\" he said. \"You weren't really aiming at it, were you?\" Mark turned to him, and a small smirk creased his lips. \"Come on, we've got more to do,\" he said. \"The day's not over yet.\" They spent the rest of the afternoon outside, climbing more trees, throwing more rocks into the ocean, and even shooting at lined-up empty beer cans with paintball guns. Every time Henry thought there was nothing left to do, Mark always came up with something new and fun. By late afternoon, the sun had begun to throw a yellowish light on the few clouds that hung in the sky. Mark had another idea and checked his watch. The tiny display blinked 5:07 p.m. \"Hey,\" he called out, \"it's time for the afternoon train!\" He began to run. \"We going somewhere?\" Henry asked, running after him. \"You'll see,\" Mark said. \"Got any pennies?\" \"I think so. Why?\" \"Just make sure they're handy,\" Mark said. They raced across a field of tall grass, then up an embankment, and through a hole in a rusty old chain-link fence. They came across some railroad tracks on an elevated bed of gravel. Henry looked in both directions, but there was no sign of a train. \"You sure one's coming?\" he asked. \"Trust me. It doesn't always come, but when it does, it's like clockwork,\" Mark said. \"Here, give me two pennies.\" Henry reached into his pocket and took out two of the copper-colored coins. Mark put one on each rail. Then he got down on his hands and knees and pressed an ear against one of the rails. \"What are you doing?\" asked Henry. \"Just like in all those Old West movies with John Wayne,\" Mark said. \"I'm listening for the train.\" \"Did you hear one?\" \"No, but let's wait for a bit.\" Henry took a step back down from the rails, but Mark just stood there beside the tracks. Henry knew Mark would have plenty of time to get away once he saw a train coming, but it still made him uneasy to see his cousin standing there. He glanced up into the sky. The few wispy clouds had gone from a pale yellow to a much darker orange, and in the near-absence of sunlight, he began to feel the surprising chill of the coming evening. \"Here it comes!\" Mark called out. Henry turned and saw that Mark had put his ear to the rail again. Henry looked far down the tracks but could see nothing. Mark really amazed him sometimes. He knew about all this stuff Henry had never even been aware of. As Henry stared down the tracks, he now saw the faint glimmer of a light appear. Mark was right: there was a train coming. Henry backed down from the railroad bed and stopped a safe distance away, but Mark stayed on the tracks. Again, Henry felt uneasy, but he knew Mark had plenty of time. Maybe he was showing off, or maybe he just felt as though he didn't have to get away from the tracks yet. Henry was tempted to say something, but he didn't want to seem like a scaredy-cat or anything, so instead he picked up a stone and threw it against the nearby fence. The train was coming closer and was now crossing the concrete trestle over a nearby ravine. Mark had still not left the tracks. What does he think he's doing? Henry wondered. Now the train was less than two hundred yards away and gaining quickly. A deafening blast of noise echoed from the whistle. Mark finally began to walk down from the tracks, but he took his time. The train's whistle blew again, and the pennies had begun to vibrate slightly on the rails. Moments later, the train rushed past, pulling a violent wake of wind along with it. Mark couldn't have been more than ten feet from the tracks when the train hurled by. Even Henry, standing nearly forty feet away, could feel his hair being blown to the side. He closed his eyes as the air was choked with a storm of dust and green slivers of torn leaves and pine needles. Henry peeked through the dust and saw Mark standing stock-still in the same position, his hair whipping crazily about his face, mouth open as if he were yelling, arms outstretched and fists clenched. It was a freight train, but not a long one. After the shiny, steel-gray locomotive, half of the cars were tankers, while the other half were open log carriers, probably carrying their cargo away from some logging grounds up north to a paper mill. The caboose had just passed when Mark scampered back up to the tracks and started searching around. In no time he'd found the two pennies, now both flattened paper-thin and shaped a bit like guitar picks. \"Here you go,\" Mark said, flipping one of the flattened pennies to Henry. Henry caught it and was surprised. Henry blew on his fingers. \"Whoa! It's hot!\" \"Yeah. It has something to do with all of the molecules getting moved around real quick,\" Mark said. \"I just thought it was one of those urban legends, you know, like the ones on the Internet?\" Henry asked curiously. Mark shrugged. \"Well, this ain't one after all. I just decided to experiment on my own one day, after hearing all the rumors at school, and voila! It worked like a charm. Heck, I even used it for a science fair project just last year.\" Henry grinned and pocketed the penny. He was amazed by some of the things his cousin knew. Then he and Mark each started to walk along separate rails, with their arms out for balance, like tightrope walkers. \"Hey, Henry.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Whoever can keep his balance the longest, and, can get back to the house fastest, gets first dibs on dessert tonight,\" Mark said. \"Deal,\" Henry said. \"Shake on it?\" Mark asked. \"You're just trying to distract me,\" Henry replied, not taking his focus off the narrow path ahead. Mark put on a wry smile. I guess that I can be a bit on the predictable side sometimes , he thought. Just you wait, Henry. Just you wait ... They were home just before dark, and had dinner with Jack, Janice, Connie, Richard, and Chloe. Henry found himself gradually letting his guard down. He was starting to feel comfortable with this family. Apparently Connie was, too, considering she'd spent most of the day either playing in the house or exploring town with Chloe. Richard had been left the odd one out (even though he'd gone into town with Connie and Chloe), and Henry felt bad for not spending any time with him. He resolved to change that tomorrow. And even though he and Mark had had some tense moments, Henry pretty much passed it off to a feeling-out process you had to go through with any new friend. After dinner (at which time Henry had gotten first dibs on dessert, much to Mark's ire), they again watched TV, this time until Janice told them all it was time for bed. Henry and Mark went upstairs, changed, washed up, and got in their bunks. They lay in bed for a while and discussed Mark's plans for the treehouse, with Henry adding a few pretty good ideas to the mix as well. Then Janice stepped into the doorway and flicked off the lights. The room went dark, except for a shaft of light from the hall coming through the doorway. \"Okay, you two. Time to sleep,\" Janice said. \"See you in the morning.\" She left the door partially open. Henry yawned. His eyelids felt heavy, and he did feel tired. It had been a long day, and he and Mark had covered a lot of ground, most of it new to Henry. He lay on his back, his head sinking into the soft feather pillow and his eyes drifted closed with a sudden wave of exhaustion. \"Hey, Henry.\" Henry's eyes flickered open. \"Yeah?\" \"You gonna keep the hideout a secret?\" \"Of course! I'm no squealer,\" Henry said indignantly. \"You can trust me, Mark.\" \"Good.\" It soon grew quiet in the room again. Henry looked over the rail at the dark silhouette in Mark's bunk below. \"Mark?\" Henry asked quietly. \"Yeah?\" \"Today was real fun.\" \"Yeah, it was, wasn't it?\" Mark said, agreeing. Again it was quiet. Henry started to drift off again. \"Hey, Henry?\" Mark asked. Henry looked back over the rail and stared through the dark at his cousin. \"Yeah?\" Mark spoke with an air of confidence, even at a whisper. \"Tomorrow's gonna be even better.\" A/N: For some time, I've been thinking of doing all or part of a chapter from either Connie or Richard's perspective (since we've largely seen from Henry and Wallace's perspectives so far, and only a bit from Jack, Janice, and Mark). Opinions as to which one I should do? Answer in a review, or message me about it.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 - Talk, Talk, Talk December 13 The moment Henry had been dreading had arrived. He and Mark had just finished a breakfast of waffles and sausage when Janice turned from the counter and said, \"I almost forgot, Henry. Maggie called last night.\" \"What did she want?\" Henry asked, his voice a bit uneasy. \"Just to remind you that your appointment's at two,\" Janice replied. Henry nodded. He was slightly embarrassed that Janice had brought it up in front of Mark. Having Maggie bring it up while they were in town yesterday had been bad enough. Janice must have sensed that, because she said, \"Chloe, Mark, why don't you two go off and do something for a little while, okay?\" Chloe got up and left right away, though Mark was slower to depart. \"Have fun,\" he said with a mild hint of sarcasm, waving to Henry. A moment later, Henry and Janice were left alone in the kitchen. \"Maybe we should call up and cancel it,\" Henry said, bringing his and Mark's dishes over to the sink. \"Why?\" Janice asked as she ran the garbage disposal. \"I don't know,\" Henry replied. \"I guess I really don't feel like I need it.\" Janice started to run the hot water and rinse the dishes before putting them in the dishwasher. \"Your father really wants you to go to this appointment, Henry. I know he does.\" \"But things have changed,\" Henry said. Janice looked surprised. \"They have?\" \"Well, sort of. I mean, I feel okay here. I don't really feel like I have to go talk to a stranger.\" \"I'm glad you feel that way, and believe me, I understand your reluctance,\" Janice said. \"But I know you promised your father you'd go. And I promised him that I'd make sure you did.\" \"Do I have to?\" Henry asked plaintively. His pleading manner earned a small laugh from Janice. \"Well, it's not like you're going to the doctor or anything.\" Henry rubbed his right leg. He could still feel the scar from where he'd gotten his AH injection, and he could almost feel the itch of the cast, too. Janice could tell that he was now uncomfortable. \"Are you all right?\" she asked. Henry nodded. \"Just some bad memories – it's nothing.\" He offered up a faint smile. \"At least Maggie's not going to give me a shot.\" Maggie Goldblum lived on the opposite side of town. Janice offered to give Henry a ride, but there was plenty of time, and Henry told her he'd just as soon walk. \"You sure you're going to go?\" Janice gave him a skeptical look. It was funny, but somehow it reminded him of a certain look his mother used to give him when he said he was going to do something and she wasn't certain he would really go and do it. \"Don't worry, Janice. I'll really go.\" Janice smiled at him. \"Okay then, Henry,\" she said. \"I suppose I'll have to give you directions.\" Several games and a few hours well-spent with Richard later, Henry rapped on the weather-beaten door that led into Maggie's house. Then he stood back and looked around her porch. Most of the space here was taken up by a set of wicker chairs that sat around a heavy, metal table with an opaque glass top. A loud buzz sounded from nearby and startled Henry. Then he realized that it was just an electronic lock, and Maggie was letting him in. He took a deep breath and strode through the door, emerging into a rather narrow entry hall. A pastel-green color adorned most of the walls as far as Henry could see, and even though he could tell that the atmosphere was meant to be bright and cheery, it had somewhat of a somber feel to it. He followed an arrow to a door marked 'Waiting Room', entered, and sat down in an old, padded wooden chair in the corner. The murmur of voices came from the next room and Henry looked to the door as they grew louder. Then the door opened and ever so briefly framed in the doorway was a cute, young redheaded girl – a teenager, judging by her looks. She and Henry exchanged a quick, awkward glance. Just as the girl was leaving, Maggie came to the door and gave Henry a friendly smile and a wave. \"Come in, come in. And, would you mind closing the door behind you?\" Henry stepped inside and closed the door. Maggie's office was a large room with a vaulted ceiling, and two of the walls lined entirely by overfilled bookshelves. There was a coffee table in the center of the room that was covered in well-used books, papers, and magazines, while a pair of overstuffed leather chairs and a worn sofa sat within an arm's length of it for easy access. The remainder of the walls and Maggie's desk were adorned by everything from watercolor paintings and hand-carved African sculptures to stuffed animals and small musical instruments. \"Hello, Henry. See if you can find a place to sit.\" Maggie gave him another smile. \"Now, my pretend name is Dr. M.A. Y for Yolante Goldblum, MD, PhD, FRS, but I can tell that you're a friendly sort, so you can just call me by my real name, which is Maggie. Now, you go here...\" Maggie motioned to the sofa, \"I'll sit across the way from you... and we can chat. Are you and your brother and sister settling in okay?\" Henry nodded as he sat down and removed his borrowed jacket. \"I'm glad,\" Maggie said, smiling. \"Mark's a real popular boy around here. You'll have to be careful that he doesn't take you over completely.\" Henry offered her a feeble smile. Then he steeled himself and looked into Maggie's eyes. \"Did they send me to see you because they know about me and my mother?\" he asked. Maggie raised an eyebrow almost imperceptibly at his question. \"Could be,\" she said, pretending to arrange a stack of papers on the coffee table in front of her and feigning ignorance. \"But I'd rather hear about it from you.\" A sigh escaped Henry's lips. \"So they do know. I thought that maybe they didn't.\" \"Why did you think that?\" \"It was just me, Connie, and Richard in the room with her. I didn't think anyone else could hear me...\" he trailed off. \"Do you think they'll send me to prison when I'm old enough?\" Surprisingly enough, Maggie maintained her casual tone. \"Oh, I don't think so.\" \"Oh, and why not?\" he countered. \"Well, for starters, what exactly have you done, Henry?\" Henry had, for a long time, tried to keep it in, but now the answer unwillingly slipped. \"I let someone die,\" he said, practically blurting it out. He couldn't believe he'd just said that. He wasn't even sure he'd ever thought of it precisely that way before, but as soon as he heard himself say it, he knew that it was true. That was how he felt. He'd promised. He'd told his mother he wouldn't let her die. Then he had. And he had let down his whole family by doing so. Maggie seemingly took his revelation in stride and leaned closer to Henry. \"Tell me how you did it, Henry. Tell me... how did you let your mother die?\" Before Henry could stop himself, the words came spilling out. The dam had finally broken. That night, several hundred concerned citizens packed the auditorium of Castel High School. As far as Janice knew, most were in favor of blocking the demolition and keeping the status quo, which was exactly what she wanted, too. And then there were those like restaurant owner Mike Hawkins. Janice couldn't understand how someone who had been born and raised here could even think of supporting this project. And she and Jack were merely 'adopted' citizens of this town. But they were loyal citizens. Janice cast a glance to either side of the stage. To her right sat Jack, and then on his right was Joan Michaels, a petite young woman in her late twenties, and beyond her were Chuck and Linnie Parks, parents of Mark's best friend Alan and longtime members of the town council. Mike Hawkins and three members of the corporation seeking to develop the beach sat behind the table off to their left. Unlike the men he sat with, all of whom were wearing suits, Mike was casually dressed. He displayed an air of confidence as he spoke. \"And what of the courageous folk who journeyed to our eastern shores nearly four hundred years back?\" he asked. \"Suppose it had been a group of Janice Evans and her friends.\" That earned him a few laughs from the audience. Janice rolled her eyes and began jotting down a memo on the pad in front of her. Mike continued. \"What would have happened then? I'll tell you what. They'd've been saying...\" He then began talking in a mockingly effeminate whine. \"...don't touch that tree. It's beautiful the way it is. Don't build that town – it'll mess up the pretty view. Don't build that bridge, or that dam, or that factory. Things are just fine the way they are.\" A few more laughs from the audience. \"And then what? Friends, I promise you, as sure as I'm standing here before you now, there would have been no civilization here, and the United States of America would not have become the greatest nation on earth!\" He was given tumultuous cheers and applause as he returned to his seat. This might be harder than I thought . Janice took a deep breath, stood to her feet, and walked to the podium. She then folded her hands and spoke into the microphone quietly but clearly, and with force. \"I've been teaching music at our schools for going on ten years now. I've taught your children and my own, and looking around, I see that I've taught quite a few of you here tonight. It won't be long before I'm teaching the children of our alumni, too. It's this kind of continuity that is now under threat. A hundred and fifty or four hundred years, it doesn't matter – that's only on the human timescale. Those beautiful rocks out on Jarman's Bay were formed two-hundred million years ago...\" The wind had kicked up around dinnertime and increased into the evening. Outside, tree branches swayed and creaked as the wind whistled through them. Henry twisted restlessly in his bunk, tangling the sheet and blanket around him. Someone was calling him. \"Henry? Henry, can you hear me?\" It was his mother! Henry looked around. He was in the woods, somehow dressed in the clothes he'd worn to the funeral. At last, Janice laid down the marker she had been using to illustrate her points about local wildlife and stepped back up to the podium to wrap up her speech. \"Those are just a few of the creatures that depend on our rocky shores. Against the immensity of the geologic and evolutionary timescale, we're the newcomers around here. And we're proposing to annihilate it all with explosives in barely a week, just to make a more tourist-friendly beach!\" That earned her a short round of respectful applause. \"What have they got up at Harbor Falls that we need here so badly? Traffic? Pollution? Drugs and alcohol? Last year they had a couple of murders. The big cities get enough of that in a single day. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not against growth, whatever Mike says... Let's grow. Let's grow the way this community has always grown for the past hundred and twenty years: steadily, and with mature consideration. Let's grow, but let's not explode!\" The auditorium erupted into a thunder of applause and scattered cheering. Some time later, the hum of fifty separate and simultaneous conversations filled the auditorium as the meeting began to break up. Janice pulled a sweater on over her dress as she weaved her way through the crowd, trying to find Jack. Surprise, surprise . Her husband was standing by the far doors, talking with Joan in an uncomfortably friendly way. And then, to make a point, Jack laid a hand on Joan's shoulder. Janice stepped forward and touched her husband's arm. Jack removed his hand from Joan's shoulder. \"We ought to be getting home,\" Janice said. Jack sighed, barely suppressing his irritation at being interrupted. \"Okay, okay. Just another few minutes, all right, Janice?\" Joan offered Janice a smile. \"It was a wonderful speech, Janice. We're lucky to have you around.\" \"Thank you, Joan,\" Janice said, a hint of ice in her voice. But her steely gaze immediately returned to Jack. It wasn't Joan she was angry with. \" Mom?!\" Henry shouted into the air. \"Where are you?!\" \" Here, Henry,\" came the reply. But now all he saw were trees moving, turning slowly as if inside a kaleidoscope. \" I can't see you!\" he shouted desperately. \" I'm here.\" But now even her voice was kaleidoscopic, coming from eight different directions at once. \" Which one are you?!\" he cried. \" This one... this one... this one... this one... this one...\" \" Which one?!\" he cried. \"Which one?! Which...\" Henry's eyes suddenly snapped open, his vision swimming. What now? Where were all the trees, and how had it gotten so dark outside all of a sudden? Reality hit him like a caffeine crash. \"Mom?\" he asked into the darkness. Outside, the wind whistled in response. Henry looked over the rail at the dark shape of Mark asleep in his bunk below. It had been a dream. Just a dream. Or was it? Henry heard a faint creak, and the door to Mark's room opened a few inches. A dim shaft of light from the hall spilled in. Who'd opened the door? Was it a draft? \"Are you there? Are you?\" Henry whispered. Curiosity and a vague sense of hope drew him out of bed and he quietly slipped through the door and into the hall. Henry looked both ways. The hall was empty. He padded over to the landing and stared over the banister. What he saw in the entryway below made him gasp. The figure of a woman in a green silk dress was slowly pacing the floor, her back to him as she stopped in front of a small table. \"Mom...?\" Henry whispered. He couldn't believe it. He started down the stairs gently and slowly, as if afraid to frighten her. As if a loud noise might cause her to bolt away like a startled rabbit. Just six steps from the bottom landing, one of them creaked. His mother whirled around, startled. Only it wasn't his mother. It was Janice. Henry was momentarily deflated when he saw his aunt's face. His legs gave out as he sat down hard on the steps. Janice rushed over to the foot of the stairs, a concerned look on her face. \"Henry? What's the matter, darling?\" Henry stared at her, his expression blank and guarded. This seemed to hold Janice back. \"Henry?\" Henry stared directly into her eyes and suddenly felt something. He could feel his lower lip tremble and his eyes begin to fill with tears. Maybe it was her. Maybe she'd just... changed a little. All those ways Janice was soft and nice and understanding to him and his siblings. Yes. Their mother was there, somewhere. Inside of Janice. \"You – you came back. I knew you'd come back,\" Henry said, his voice trembling. Janice looked confused. \"Of course I came back,\" she said matter-of-factly. It was too much. Just as the words had come spilling out to Maggie Goldblum that afternoon, now all the grief Henry had been holding inside came spilling out. Henry buried his face in his hands and began to sob. All the pain and misery of the past seven months, ever since his mom had gotten sick... It all came pouring out. For the most part, he had held it in for Connie and Richard's sake, but now, it was his time to cry. His time to mourn. Janice came up the steps and sat beside him, enveloping him with her arms. Henry knew it was happening, and in a way he was grateful for it, but at the moment, his aunt's presence made no difference. Nothing on the outside mattered. It was all on the inside, and it now was all pouring out. The sound of a boy crying brought Jack out of the den. He stood in the doorway at the end of the hall, not wanting his presence to be noticed. A look of sadness and knowing sympathy was etched into his face. Janice gently rocked Henry back and forth and lightly kissed him atop his head. It had been a long time since she had held her own son this way. Someone else watched them as well. Mark stood behind the banister upstairs, his hair tousled and clothes rumpled by an interrupted sleep, watching how his mother cradled Henry, and how his father stood watching silently in the doorway down the hall. It infuriated him. He narrowed his eyes and scowled. Why was his mother doing that? She was his mother, not Henry's. He wished she'd stop. A/N: Reviews (if any) are always appreciated. Coming up next will be 'Chapter 10: The Dog'. The 'AH' in AH injection stands for Accelerated Healing. In this world, with its more advanced technology, nanomedicine (basically, nanites used for medical purposes) is a major, leading branch of medical science. It's actually rather fascinating, though in reality, it's still years away from practical and widespread applications.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10 - The Dog December 14 In the morning, Mark's bunk was already empty. Henry was slow to get up. He hadn't gotten much in the way of sleep the night before. All those feelings... all that crying... Henry yawned and scratched his head. Just the memory of it made him feel tired. Finally he got up and went to the window. Rain spattered hard against the glass. For what he could see, there was no sign of Mark out in the yard. Still wearing his pajamas, Henry staggered out of the room and made his way downstairs. The strong smell of coffee and what could've been some kind of spice wafted from the kitchen. Janice was sitting at a barstool behind the marble-topped island counter, sipping a mug of coffee and listening to the morning news on the radio. She looked up and smiled when Henry walked in. \"Good morning, Henry.\" \"Morning,\" he mumbled, trying to rub the sleep from his eyes. \"I tried to save you some French toast. But your brother and sister ate it all,\" she said. Henry laughed a little. That was just like them. \"Where are they now?\" \"Exploring the basement with Chloe,\" Janice replied. \"As for Mark...he's out in this rain doing God only knows what.\" Henry nodded and went over to the table. He suddenly felt rather awkward and mildly embarrassed around his aunt and stared down at the table before him, trying to avoid Janice's gaze. Then he heard the scraping of wooden legs against the floor and the soft padding of her footsteps, and knew she was coming closer. He felt a hand rest gently on his shoulder. \"How are you feeling?\" she asked. \"Okay.\" Henry glanced up for a second. He saw caring and concern in her eyes and no longer felt quite so embarrassed. She cared. She understood. Just like his mom. Her hand left his shoulder as if she knew just how long he'd be comfortable with it there. \"I suppose you're hungry, right?\" \"Yeah,\" Henry said, nodding slightly. \"Do you want pancakes again, or are you gonna go with French toast?\" Henry thought about it for a moment and a smile began to turn the corners of his mouth ever so slightly. \"I'll have some French toast. If it's not too much trouble, that is.\" Janice gave him a big smile. \"French toast, coming right up.\" Henry was just finishing his second helping of French toast with more of the real Vermont syrup when Chloe suddenly burst into the kitchen, with Connie and Richard at her heels. \"Hey, Mom! Guess what?!\" Chloe exclaimed. \"What?\" Janice asked playfully, grinning. \"Look what we found down in the basement!\" Chloe's hands, which, until now, had been behind her back, held out a slightly dusty box containing a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle. The picture displayed on the front of the box showed a beautiful view of a lake nestled in a mountain wilderness, probably somewhere in the Rockies. \"Seems like a pretty big puzzle for you, Chloe,\" Janice said. \"You sure you're up to the challenge?\" Chloe nodded vigorously. \"Don't leave us out,\" Richard piped up eagerly. \"I second that,\" Connie said. \"Would you like to join us, Henry?\" Chloe asked, turning to face him. Her voice was almost pleading. Henry took a second glance at the puzzle. A 500-piecer . Sure, it'll be a challenge, but it's a good one, he thought. He nodded. \"Sure. I'll join you. Just gotta put on some regular clothes first.\" Chloe's face turned upward in a huge, ear-to-ear grin of delight. \"Awesome! We'll be up in my room.\" Not ten minutes later, Henry was lying on his stomach on the floor in Chloe's room, trying to get the puzzle pieces organized. \"We turn the pieces over first, right?\" Chloe asked. \"Yep,\" Henry replied. Another couple minutes later, their task was complete. \"What next?\" Richard asked. \"All the pieces with a straight edge,\" Henry replied, and he put several pieces together as an example. Chloe did likewise. But his brother and sister both frowned. \"What is it?\" Henry asked. \"It's too hard that way,\" Connie said. \"If it weren't for you and Dad, I wouldn't even know how to put my puzzle together, let alone this one.\" \"Okay, okay,\" Henry said, nodding. He shared a quick look with Chloe and shrugged. \"Then pick a color. How about the sky?\" Connie nodded, and they all started putting together the light blue pieces. She picked up a piece with some blue and some white in it. She seemed uncertain about where it would go. \"It's got blue in it, Conse,\" Henry said, gently encouraging her. \"So it has to be sky,\" Connie replied. \"But what's the white?\" \"Oh, I don't know,\" Henry said, grinning. \"Think of it this way, Connie. What's white, and in the sky?\" said Chloe. \"A cloud!\" Connie said. \"Right,\" said Henry. \"And it's got a straight edge...\" \"So it has to go...\" Connie's eyes raced over the puzzle. \"Here!\" \"Nice job!\" Henry said, beaming. \"Now, do you see any blue pieces with a straight edge?\" It was a general question. Chloe's hand hovered over a green and blue piece, and then she spoke up. \"You're all so nice,\" she said. \"Well, so are you,\" Connie replied. \"Thanks,\" Chloe said rather timidly. She now seemed to hesitate. \"Do you guys like living in our house?\" she asked. \"Absolutely!\" Connie said, her voice enthusiastic. \"What's not to like?\" Henry said, smiling. \"Sure...\" Richard mumbled. Chloe's face brightened considerably. \"Good. We're going to look after you real well. So none of you are sad.\" That caught Henry by surprise. He wasn't sad – at least not this morning. A slight rustling noise sounded from the doorway and Henry turned his head in that direction. Mark was standing there, wearing a camouflage jacket that was covered in a dark green rain poncho. \"Hey, Henry. I've got something I wanna show you.\" \"Outside?\" Henry asked. \"What? You afraid of a little rain?\" Mark asked, tone laced with mild sarcasm. Henry stood, walked over to the door, and stood face-to-face with his cousin. \"No,\" Henry replied, crossing his arms in front of him. A grin suddenly split Mark's face. \"Good.\" \"Don't worry. I'll help you guys finish the puzzle later. I promise,\" Henry said, as he started following Mark out into the hall. Chloe, and then Connie and Richard stood up and tried to follow. Mark held up a hand and planted it on Chloe's chest. \"Not you,\" Mark said tersely. \"But I'm his friend too,\" Chloe replied. \"Well, two's company. Five's way too much of a crowd,\" Mark said dismissively. Then he gave his sister a slight backwards shove. Chloe stumbled, but caught herself. She sent a scathing glare at her brother. Mark simply ignored it. Henry raised an eyebrow – this wasn't your typical brother-sister dynamic. There was something else going on here. And it wasn't normal. Chloe's eyes met Henry's, and he felt bad for her. He didn't mind playing with her when Mark wasn't around, but when Mark was around, it was no contest, really. He didn't want to leave his siblings alone all day again either, least of all Richard, who had no one else to share his interests. But once again, Henry found himself being drawn into the strange enigma that was Mark Evans. Henry followed Mark down the stairs. He was startled to hear the sudden pounding of angry footsteps in the hall above and Chloe came to the top landing, hands on her hips and face fixed in a mean scowl. \"I don't care about your stupid secrets, Mark!\" she shouted. \"I've got my own secrets, and I'm not going to tell you a single one!\" Henry stopped on the bottom landing and stared back up at his younger cousin. He was shocked by the sudden fury bursting forth from the eight year-old girl, who, just minutes ago, had been so happy and enthusiastic. Mark tugged at Henry's sleeve. Henry gave Chloe one last glance. After donning boots, a coat, and a poncho of his own, Henry followed Mark out the front door and into the pouring rain. Chloe sighed heavily and balled her hands into fists. Once again, Mark had found a way to trump her. She had hoped that maybe Henry was on her side, that just maybe he could stand up to Mark on her behalf. But just like everyone else, Henry had been drawn away by her brother's seemingly irresistible charm. She had long wondered why Mark was like this. Henry seemed so nice with Connie and Richard, and she didn't doubt his loyalty to them. But that loyalty had probably been forged through the shared pain of their mother's death. If not for that, they would probably be just like a normal, bickering trio of siblings. Like any normal brothers and sisters would do. Chloe had many friends at school with older siblings. Sure, those older brothers or sisters might treat them like brats or pick-on and tease them, but none of them had ever gotten the same cruel treatment Mark afforded solely for her. It was wrong, period. Mom and Dad don't believe a word I say about what he does. But one day, somebody will. Henry followed Mark through the woods toward the bunker and very nearly slipped on the muddy trail several times. Rain spattered down from the canopy of trees overhead, almost as if they weren't even there. By the time they actually reached the bunker, Henry's socks and the lower half of his jeans were soaked and his boots were caked in mud. He stepped inside and closed the doors just as Mark flicked on the fluorescent lights overhead. Where Mark's crossbow contraption had been the other day, now a sleek, jet-black quadrotor drone with red detailing sat in its place. It had four blades, with ducted housings that were fused to each other and the main hull of the drone itself. Henry whistled in amazement. \"Wow...\" Mark beamed. \"I know, right?\" Henry circled the table, admiring the drone. \"Where'd you get it?\" \"A hobby shop down in San Francisco last year.\" \"Why's it down here?\" \"Dad thinks I broke it this past summer. I don't really want him to know that I fixed it.\" Henry raised an eyebrow at that, but he merely shrugged it off and suddenly took notice that this drone wasn't ordinary. \"You modified it,\" Henry said, leaning in for a closer look. There was a grappling hook of sorts mounted to the bottom of it. \"Sure did,\" Mark replied, a hint of pride in his voice. \"What are you going to do with it?\" Henry asked. Mark stepped around the table and stood in front of Henry. \"Can you really keep a secret? This is very important.\" \"Of course,\" Henry said, sounding mildly offended. \"I want you to help me with it tomorrow. We're going on a little hike.\" \"Where?\" Henry asked just as Mark threw the light switch and again plunged the old bunker into darkness. Mark pulled the doors open and was silhouetted against the rain and dim light outside. He turned to Henry. \"Henry, I promise you something truly amazing. Something you'll never forget. OK?\" Henry gave him an almost imperceptible nod and followed him out of the bunker and back into the woods. December 15 The next morning, following a quick breakfast of cereal and milk, the boys headed back into the woods, this time, bearing Mark's contraption. They stopped behind a pile of old logs near the edge of the road and dug in for another session of target practice. \"Status,\" Mark asked. Henry put on a mock serious face and slid a bolt into the central slot. \"System armed and ready.\" \"Excellent.\" Mark hefted the device and set it up on a fallen log. Then he began to work the ratchet back and forth. \"Increasing torque. Be on the lookout for incoming.\" Henry scanned the blue sky with his eyes, punctuated here and there by a puff of white cloud. \"Torque at maximum,\" Mark announced. He pulled the hood of his ghillie suit up and over his face before crouching down behind the device and looking down the scope. \"Scanning.\" \"Try and hit that tree,\" Henry said. \"Negative,\" Mark replied. \"OK then...try and hit the wall,\" Henry suggested, pointing to the wall that shielded them from sight of any passersby's on the road. \"Negative,\" Mark said, and kept on scanning. Henry wondered what he was looking for. He didn't have to wonder for long. \"Great!\" Mark said. \"Target acquired.\" Henry looked up over the log pile. Trotting along the inner edge of the wall, completely oblivious to their presence, was Captain Lawson's scruffy brown terrier, carrying a rolled-up newspaper in its mouth. \"Oh look...it's Captain Lawson's nasty little mutt,\" Mark said in a mocking voice. He began to move the device in time with the dog as it neared their position. It seemed to Henry that he was aiming right at it. \"What are you doing?\" Henry asked, concern in his voice. Mark turned the contraption one last time and aimed the scope directly ahead of the dog. Just as it crossed his line of sight, he fired. In that split second, Henry heard the clunk and whine of the device, and the sudden, surprised yelp from the dog as it staggered against the wall but kept on walking. Henry breathed a sigh of relief. Mark hadn't been aiming for it after all! But then a small crimson spot appeared on the dog's side. Henry's breath hitched in his throat. The spot began to grow larger. And the dog faltered, but tried to keep on walking. \"Oh, my God!\" Henry gasped. By now, the red spot covered the dog's entire side, marring the brown fur. His legs buckled and folded beneath him. He struggled up, almost succeeding in getting back to his feet, and finally toppled down in a heap. A pitiful whimper echoed from his mouth. One leg pawed at the air and fell. Then the dog lay still. Henry was too stunned to say anything else. He turned and stared at Mark in disbelief. Mark had pulled the hood back from his face and was still watching the dog. His expression was one of rapt wonder and awe. Mark caught Henry's look of disbelief. Then Mark spread his hands innocently and said, \"I only wanted to scare it!\" Henry wondered just how sincere he was. They carried the dead animal by its' legs into a heavily wooded thicket, as far as possible from the house. After maybe five minutes, Mark had finished digging a shallow grave in the soft earth. He tried to pull the newspaper from the dog's now-stiff jaws, but it wouldn't budge. Henry took the dog's rear legs, while Mark took the front, and they dropped the poor animal into its' final resting place. Mark took a spade and began to cover the dog with the excavated dirt. \"Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust...\" Disgusted, Henry turned away, but as he did, he caught sight of nearly a dozen small mounds in the earth. \"What are those?\" he asked. Mark turned from his grim work and looked to where Henry was pointing. He shrugged. \"Dunno. Moles, I guess,\" he replied with a grin. Henry raised an eyebrow. Moles? Mark then started to blow a mock version of 'Taps' as he filled in the grave. Henry shook his head in disgust and simply walked away. Sometimes Mark could funny. And sometimes he wasn't – like right now. \"C'mon, Henry! Where's your sense of humor?\" Mark called after him in an oddly jovial tone. There was a weird smile on his face, too. Henry didn't reply and kept on walking. There was something wrong with this. He was starting to think his cousin was really sick. A/N: Hope you're liking it so far. Chapter 11 will be posted as soon as possible. I already know what I'm having Mark do with the mini-drone , but I wanted some opinions on what to do for the 'Blackout' chapter. In the original TGS, Mark has no siblings of his own to protect, hence why he so readily jumps to Connie's defense; but here, with Henry having Connie and Richard to protect, how will he handle the blackout? Will he also jump in to protect Chloe from Mark? Would he drag Connie and Richard through a darkened house to find Mark and Chloe? Suggestions and opinions are definitely welcome. As for the drone, picture one of those Parrot AR 2.0's. It's a real-life mini-drone/UAV you can control with a tablet or smartphone (typically iPads and iPhones). Reviews: Thank you, Comedy Monarchy. I appreciate the support. And, don't worry AM83220, you won't be disappointed. Mark's katana will be used later on.[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 - The Friend Once again, Henry was trying as hard as he could to avoid Janice's gaze. What he had just seen her son do... She would never believe him, and at this point, telling her, or anyone else what had happened would only get him caught in the middle. And for that reason, Henry bit his tongue and didn't say a word about this morning's incident. In fact, he hadn't spoken a word to anyone since. Unfortunately, his total silence was now drawing Janice's attention. \"Henry? Are you all right?\" Janice asked. Henry slowly looked up at her. He and Mark were seated on the bar stools behind the counter, and Janice was over by the oven, making their lunch: toasted chicken subs. Henry shrugged. \"Yeah...\" he replied in a mildly offhanded tone. \"Just drifted off for a sec there.\" \"Okay...\" Janice said uncertainly. \"I was just wondering, since you've been so quiet.\" But even after she had plated their food and set it in front of them, Henry just stared at it, while Mark quickly began to wolf his down. \"Are you sure you're okay, Henry? You don't seem like you're very hungry.\" Henry nodded. But he still couldn't get the memory of that morning out of his head. \"It's pretty unusual for a boy your age not to have any appetite,\" Janice said. Henry looked over at Mark. \"We stopped at Parsons' in town this morning. Henry had his fair share of the cookies there,\" Mark said in between bites. \"Ah ha,\" Janice said, nodding. There was a slight grin on her face. \"That explains it.\" Henry bit his lip. The temptation to let Janice know the truth about that morning was almost overwhelming. But then he briefly locked eyes with Mark. Neither of them even flinched. They just stared at each other. Just keep your mouth shut , Mark's eyes seemed to say to him. Not unless you want to get in trouble, too . Henry quickly broke off eye contact and finally took a bite of his sandwich. Dang, it really was good. Janice knew her food, that was for sure. Henry was barely halfway finished with his sandwich when a loud car horn sounded from the driveway. Mark's face lit up upon hearing the noise. He eagerly looked up at Janice, who nodded, a smile on her face. Then he turned to Henry. \"Hey, Henry – You mind coming outside with me?\" Mark asked. Henry was uncertain. \"Why?\" \"There's someone out there I want you to meet.\" \"Who?\" Henry asked. \"One of my friends from school.\" One of his friends ... Well, it couldn't be all bad, especially after what had happened earlier. With any luck, he wouldn't have to worry about Mark's friends doing anything strange, either. \"Sure,\" Henry said with an offhanded shrug. \"Why not?\" He took one last bite of his sandwich and rather wistfully left it on the plate to follow Mark. On their way down the hall, Henry was very nearly mowed down by Richard, who came bolting down the stairs, face eager. \"Is Daddy back?\" Richard asked excitedly. Henry went stock still for a second and he shook his head rather sadly. \"Sorry, buddy. We went over this the night he left, remember?\" Richard's face fell. The four year-old nodded dejectedly. Henry kneeled in front of his little brother and laid both hands on his shoulders. \"Dad's going to come back when he comes back, Rich. I miss him, too. But you've gotta be strong – show everyone how grown up you can be,\" Henry said, giving Richard an encouraging smile. \"Real-y? Me?\" Richard asked, blinking back tears. Henry nodded. \"You bet, little man. Maybe you can even show up your big sis, too.\" That brought a tiny grin to Richard's face. He sniffled. \"OK. I will do 'at.\" Now it was Henry's turn to smile. \"Atta boy, Rich. And don't worry – I promise we'll do something together later tonight, OK?\" \"Okeydokey, Henny.\" Henry had to grin at that one. Richard could pronounce almost every 'R' he spoke aloud, except for the one in Henry's name. He even heard a barely suppressed snicker from Mark. Henry ignored it. Then he wrapped Richard in a bear hug and growled in a low, throaty voice, eliciting a fit of giggles from the four year-old. \"Now go on,\" Henry said. He tousled Richard's hair and gave him a pat on the head before the little boy scampered off into the kitchen, probably to ask Janice for a snack or something. Mark gave Henry a strange look as they slipped on their shoes and jackets. \"What?\" Henry asked, raising an eyebrow. His cousin shrugged indifferently. \"Nothin',\" Mark replied as they headed out the front door, his voice all-too nonchalant. Sitting in the driveway behind the carport was a dark blue Chevy Suburban, engine idling. And as soon as Mark and Henry were outside, the engine shut off and a boy of near-equal height to both cousins hopped out and let out a deep breath, a contented grin on his face. Mark jogged over to the boy, not waiting for Henry to follow, hand outstretched. They shook and clapped each other on the back. As Henry strode down the walk to join them, he saw an older man, probably of his own father's age and roughly the same height leaning against the far side of the SUV. He was wearing a dark green windbreaker and jeans, and sported a head of average-length, medium-brown hair. The boy, on the other hand, though of equal height and presumably similar age to Mark and Henry, sported a head of shaggy, carrot-red hair. He wore white and gray sneakers, blue jeans, and a black hoodie emblazoned with the Los Angeles Rams logo. Then he saw Henry and offered a hand. \"You must be Mark's cousin from Maine. Alan Parks.\" Henry shook his hand. \"Henry.\" \"Kinda sucks that we all live in states or parts of states where you can get pneumonia from swimming half of the year, huh?\" Alan quipped. Henry smiled and laughed. He was glad to meet someone else his age with a more normal sense of humor. \"It's that way almost year-round in Maine. At least here you have some real beaches to speak of. Back home, what few beaches we have are all cold and gray. Not very exciting, as I'm sure you can well imagine.\" \"What say we head in and watch something?\" Mark said, suddenly breaking into the conversation. \"Preferably a movie.\" Alan chuckled as he hefted a sleeping bag and backpack out of the SUV. \"Always in a hurry, aren't you?\" he said. \"You have no idea,\" Henry said. That earned him a slap in the back of the head from Mark. \"Ow! What was that for?\" Mark just shrugged indifferently. Then he waved to the man standing behind the SUV. \"Hey, Mr. Parks.\" Chuck Parks nodded. \"Mark. How's things?\" \"Pretty good.\" \"Dad, didn't you say something about Christmas shopping on the way over?\" Alan asked, a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. His father sighed and chuckled as he got back in the SUV. \"I'm going, I'm going.\" The three boys stood off to one side as he carefully turned the huge vehicle around, and waved until he disappeared down the drive and out of sight. Then Henry and Alan followed Mark inside, where Janice was waiting for them. \"Hello, Alan.\" Alan nodded and gave Janice a goofy grin. \"Hey there, Mrs. E.\" \"You ready for tomorrow night?\" Janice asked. \"You bet,\" Alan replied, his tone confident. Mark groaned and rolled his eyes. \"Aw, Mom... You're not gonna make Alan practice, are you?\" Henry looked on in confusion. He had absolutely no idea what was going on now. Janice's tone was surprisingly patient. \"No, not right now, at least,\" she said, folding her arms in front of her. Mark's face suddenly looked downcast. \"I'm sorry if I came across as rude, Mom. I didn't mean to be.\" \"I know, sweetheart.\" \"I'll try to be more understanding next time,\" Mark said apologetically. \"I know,\" Janice replied. \"Now you three go on and have some fun. By all means don't let me stop you.\" As she returned to the kitchen, Henry scratched his head in confusion. \"Okay... Someone mind telling me what just happened there?\" Mark sighed. \"She's set up a benefit concert at the high school tomorrow night, for her beach thing. Chloe and Al-Park here are part of it.\" Henry raised an eyebrow. \"Al-Park?\" \"Alan Parks. Al-Park,\" Mark explained. By Henry's look, anyone could tell he still didn't understand. \"Watch it,\" Alan said. \"Don't go pulling that one out unless you want to be called Marky-Mark.\" A sigh escaped Mark's lips. \"Fine,\" he grumbled. Turnabout's fair play , Henry thought. \"Now, Mark. You still got those Nerf guns?\" Alan asked, grinning. The next few hours practically flew by. Following an hour-long Nerf battle in the upstairs hall, they watched Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade on the flatscreen in Mark's room, all the while eating popcorn and occasionally whispering back and forth. Once the movie was over and done with, Mark had practically begged Janice to order them some pizza. Now the boys were out in the driveway, with Henry and Alan engaged in a heated, one-on-one basketball game, all the while trying to teach Mark the basics of the game. In order to do so, Mark simply watched from the open tailgate of the van in silence as Henry and Alan each dribbled the orange and black ball around the driveway, with one occasionally faking the other out and trying to make a basket. They were quite evenly matched, from what Mark could tell. But the way they had connected almost instantly was what worried Mark. Why hadn't Henry connected so well with him at first? A feeling of jealousy began to grow inside of him. \"Mark!\" Mark was quickly snapped out of his train of thought. \"Yeah?\" he said, looking up. Henry looked at him quizzically. \"You paying attention here, or what?\" Mark shrugged. \"Sure.\" \"Then come on over, man,\" Henry said, waving to Mark. \"I shouldn't have to tell you, it takes a certain level of patience,\" Henry said. Sighing, Mark stepped forward and took the ball from Henry. \"I got it, cuz.\" At first, Henry was inclined to believe him. Mark was dribbling the ball, albeit a tad awkwardly, but he was doing it nonetheless. Henry nodded in approval. Not bad ... Then Mark tried for a basket. But instead of simply lobbing the ball up and into the net like both Henry and Alan expected, he tried for a slam-dunk. The ball simply ricocheted off the backboard, sending it flying twenty feet down the driveway, and rolling another ten. Mark didn't fare much better – after hanging from the rim for a few seconds, he fell flat on his rear end. Henry put his head in his hands and sighed. Maybe I spoke too soon . \"You all right, man?\" Alan asked as he and Henry ran forward to help Mark up. Henry's cousin grimaced slightly. \"Yeah. I'm good.\" He suddenly put on a cheesy grin as he raced off to retrieve the ball. \"He just never learns, does he?\" Henry remarked, sighing. \"Not really,\" Alan replied. Henry's face suddenly grew pensive. \"Alan?\" \"Yeah?\" Henry briefly glanced in the direction Mark had disappeared and lowered his voice. \"It may be nothing. My dad told me not to take anything too seriously.\" \"What is it, then?\" asked Alan. \"Have you ever noticed anything..., well, 'strange' or 'different' about Mark?\" The other boy sighed and bit his lip. \"So you've noticed, too, huh?\" Henry scoffed. \"Hard not to,\" he replied. \"Especially the way he treats Chloe.\" \"I just thought that was the way siblings typically were,\" Alan said, shrugging. Henry shook his head. \"Even at our worst, I'd never treat Connie like that. You don't know the half of it.\" Alan snorted. \"Oh, I think I have a pretty good idea. This one time he seems like he's actually in a good mood, I asked him if I can hold that Japanese sword, even just for a minute...\" \"Believe me, I know,\" Henry said. \"First full day here, I saw him practically twist Chloe's arms off just because she picked up a baseball we'd been tossing around earlier.\" \"There's something about him... I just can't put my finger on it.\" Alan said under his breath as Mark came jogging back up the driveway, the basketball under his arm, still grinning. \"So, how'd I do?\" Mark asked. Henry opened his mouth to respond when a strange car came rolling up the drive behind Mark, a lit sign atop it. Mark whirled around and broke into a huge grin as he jumped out of the car's path. \"All right!\" he shouted triumphantly. The pizza was here. \"Not bad,\" Henry said in reply to his cousin as they started trudging off toward the house. Mark was first up the walk and he quickly disappeared into the house. But Henry took Alan aside, letting the pizza guy past them. \"That something about him...\" Henry said, his words trailing off. \"Yeah?\" \"Does it feel as if...\" Henry hesitated for a moment. \"'Does it feel as if' what, Henry?\" Alan asked, getting slightly impatient. \"As if something's missing?\" A/N: I know, a bit of a filler chapter and I may have rushed it a tad, but it'll help set up some later parts of the story. And don't worry - this won't be Alan's only appearance. Chapter 12 - 'The Drone' is next, and I'll try to get it out ASAP. The action and tension will pick up in there, and in the next chapter. I guarantee it. And, sometime in the next few chapters, I'll try to include the first POV from Richard's perspective. As for the LA Rams reference, even though at this point it was a year before they moved to St. Louis in OTL, they'll still be in California through modern times in this universe. * Try guessing where Mark's nickname comes from. Reviews: Again, thank you for all the reviews and compliments, 90TheGeneral09.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 - The Drone Later that night, after Connie, Richard, and Chloe had all gone to bed, Henry suddenly found himself with nothing to do. And with Alan off practicing with Janice, and Mark up in his room, doing God only knew what, Henry now found himself alone, too. He wandered out into the living room. A bunch of framed photographs sat on top of the baby grand piano. Henry wandered over to it and struck a key with his finger. A note rang out, but it didn't sound right. Maybe it needed tuning? He began to look at the pictures. A lot of them were of Jack, Janice, Mark, and Chloe. Some were bright summer shots of them at the beach in light clothes; others were taken in the middle of a darker, snowy winter, probably up in the mountains. There were also photos of them with people Henry didn't know – obviously friends or other, more distant relatives. Then a mid-size photo in a silver frame caught his eye. It was of his mom and dad, standing on the front porch of their house back in Maine, his mother holding a small, blond-haired child. They were dressed warmly and had big smiles on their faces. His mother's hair was long and she looked very healthy. Henry turned the frame over. On the back, someone had written ' Wallace, Susan, and little Henry – Thanksgiving, 1983 .' Henry suddenly felt tears rise uncontrollably into his eyes. It was all so hard to believe. It was all so unfair. It made him feel so bad. Why did she have to go away? He turned the frame over again and looked down at the photo. A tear suddenly splashed against the glass. Then another. \"Henry?\" Startled, Henry spun around, accidentally knocking several of the photographs off the piano with his arm. They fell to the carpet with a muffled crash. \"Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry,\" Henry gasped, quickly rubbing the tears from his eyes and kneeling down. \"I didn't mean to...\" \"It's all right,\" Janice said, joining him. \"I'm really sorry,\" Henry said. He started picking up the pictures. So far none of them appeared to be broken. \"It's no big deal,\" Janice said dismissively. \"I swear it was an accident,\" Henry blurted. \"Really.\" Janice gave him a funny smile. \"I believe you, Henry. Anyway, nothing's broken. We'll just put them all back the way they were and everything will be...\" Her voice trailed off as she caught sight of the photograph Henry still held in his hand. \"Oh, Henry,\" she said softly and sadly. Henry stared down at the floor, unable to look her in the eye. \"Maybe I should have put that one away,\" Janice said. \"No, it's okay,\" Henry said softly. He looked down at the photo. \"Did you like my mom?\" \"Oh, yes,\" Janice replied. \"Everybody did.\" \"That's what everybody says . You're not just saying that for my sake, are you?\" \"No, of course I'm not. She was a wonderful person, Henry. And she loved you all very much.\" Henry gently squeezed the frame in his hand. \"Just someone in a picture...just anyone...and anyone could look at it...there's nothing special about it, really...\" \"Of course she's special, Henry,\" Janice said. \"She always will be. To you, your siblings, and anyone in their right mind who cared about her.\" \"The last time I saw her...she said she'd always be with me.\" \"It's true,\" Janice said. \"People may die, but they'll always stay with you. They never leave you.\" As she said this, she bent down and picked up one last photograph. It was of a boy with a head of shaggy, medium-brown hair, maybe two or three years old, wearing green pajamas and holding a toy rubber whale. Janice suddenly grew quiet. \"Is that Matthew?\" Henry asked in a somewhat hesitant voice. Janice nodded rather sadly, her eyes wistful. \"Your mother is alive in you,\" she said, looking into Henry's eyes. \"She'll always be a part of you.\" \"And Matthew in you?\" Henry asked. \"Yes.\" \"What was he like?\" Janice smiled and wiped a small tear from her eye. \"He was very inquisitive and even helpful for his age. Eager and full of energy.\" \"Sounds like Richard to me,\" Henry said, a smile turning at the corners of his mouth. \"I thought so, too,\" Janice said. \"From the minute I laid eyes on your little brother...\" Henry suddenly looked around. \"Where's Alan?\" he asked. \"I thought you were practicing something with him for tomorrow night.\" \"We finished a few minutes ago, and I sent him up to Mark...\" she suddenly trailed off as her gaze turned toward the hall. Suddenly Henry felt someone else in the room. He turned and saw Mark standing in the doorway. He didn't know why, but he had a feeling that his cousin had been standing there and watching them for a while. \"Oh, Mark. Hi, hon.\" Janice said. \"Hi.\" Mark's tone was flat and utterly devoid of emotion. It was different, almost disturbingly so, from the boy with seemingly boundless energy and no limits that Henry knew and had grown accustomed to. Janice stood and spoke to both of them at once. \"It's getting late. I'll come up with you, help you guys get settled for the night.\" As they started up the stairs, Janice talked over her shoulder. \"I've been meaning to ask you two – What are you up to out in the woods?\" \"Well, it's this –\" Mark sharply cut Henry off in mid-sentence. \"It's a surprise,\" he said. Once again, Henry was momentarily embarrassed, his loyalties torn between Mark and Janice. But Mark's mother simply laughed it off. \"A 'surprise.' OK, then. If that's the way you want it.\" Henry briefly exchanged glances with Mark, but the latter's icy stare kept him silent right up to the moment he fell asleep. December 16 The next morning, Alan's father arrived to pick him up right after breakfast, and Mark went out to the bunker. Said he had to take care of something before their big hike later. Henry didn't ask what it was, and frankly, he didn't really care. He'd had enough of Mark's 'secrets' for the time being. Once again, he found himself without anything to do. It was an aggravating feeling, to say the least. And that was what pushed him to go look into Jack's study. It was the one room in the house that Mark's father didn't allow him to go into unsupervised. From the second Henry peeked through the partly open door, it kind of reminded him of Maggie's office, with stuffed animal heads (the trophy kind) and curious watercolor paintings mounted high up on the wall. It was dark inside and the curtains were half-closed, letting in only a dim shaft of morning sunlight. \"Henry?\" At the sound of the voice, and a firm hand resting on his shoulder, Henry froze and spun around, in trepidation and fear of doing something he maybe shouldn't be doing. \"Uncle Jack?\" Mark's father stood in front of Henry, wearing a loose-fitting green t-shirt and jeans, not to mention a bemused grin on his face. \"I – I was just –\" Henry stammered. \"Easy there, big guy,\" Jack said, chuckling. \"You're not in trouble or anything. I was just coming in to get something out of my desk, but now that I think about it, I have wanted to talk with you, so, come on in for a minute.\" Henry's eyes widened, still thinking he was in trouble. \"Are you sure?\" he asked. Jack nodded and motioned for Henry to follow him as he went inside and turned on the lights. Henry took a few tentative steps once he was through the door and stopped just short of his uncle's desk. \"Go on. Sit down,\" Jack said with a laugh. \"I don't bite.\" That brought a slight grin to Henry's face as he dropped into one of the chairs in front of Jack's desk. \"I know it's going on five days that you've been here, but I just want to make sure you're all having a good time and settling in all right.\" Henry nodded. \"So far, so good, Uncle Jack. No complaints on my end.\" That was a total lie . He hated lying to his uncle, but saying anything to Jack about his son right now would probably meet with as much success as trying to tell Janice yesterday at lunch. \"You sure you're not homesick or anything?\" Jack asked. \"I'm fine, though you might wanna keep an eye on Rich – he thought Alan arriving yesterday was Dad coming back,\" Henry said. A slight frown crossed Jack's face. \"Poor little guy. That must've been a pretty big letdown.\" Henry solemnly nodded in agreement. \"I talked with him, tried to explain it.\" \"And?\" \"I told him to be strong and show everyone how grown up he could be. Even gave him an extra incentive by telling him he could try and show up Connie.\" Jack chuckled. \"That ought to do it. And I should know – there's nothing quite like the idea of showing up an older sibling.\" \"I don't exactly have that option,\" Henry said. \"Being the oldest has its' advantages and disadvantages.\" \"I think your dad might agree with that. On the one hand, he could boss me around, but on the other, he was responsible for me and had to do more than half of the chores on his own 'till I was old enough.\" \"I do what I have to,\" Henry replied. \"It's not much.\" \"Not much? Just last week, your dad told me you had too much on your plate.\" Henry just shrugged nonchalantly. \"I can handle it.\" \"Can you?\" Jack asked, concerned. Henry nodded. \"I have to. I promised her.\" \"Who? Your mother?\" The boy's silence spoke volumes. \"I know how you feel, Henry. When we lost Matthew... Look, you can talk to me, okay?\" When his nephew still didn't respond, Jack quickly changed the subject. \"Are you certain you and Mark are getting along all right?\" Henry grimaced and took in a sharp breath. \"Not entirely.\" Jack nodded. \"I thought as much,\" he said. \"I know Mark can seem a little...strange at times, but that's just the way he is. He takes some getting used to.\" No kidding , Henry thought. \"And, if it makes you feel any better, it took Alan a good while, too. Now, just look at 'em. They're like best pals. You two don't exactly see eye to eye on something right now – that much I can tell, but you'll be back to being best buds by tomorrow or sooner. I guarantee it.\" If only it were that easy, Uncle Jack ... \"Tell you what, as long as you're careful, I'll let you come in here and look around whenever you want,\" Jack said. Henry's eyes went wide. \"Really?\" Jack grinned. \"Sure. I could tell that you were pretty curious. And, I hate to say it, but I trust you in here alone more than I do Mark.\" Henry raised an eyebrow at that. Odd . He was a complete stranger in this house, having never been here before in his life, and yet his Uncle Jack trusted him more than he did his own son. \"Why?\" Henry asked. \"Mark can get a little too curious sometimes.\" Henry gave a silent nod of agreement. At that moment, a slight creeping sensation invaded the back of his neck. It was all-too familiar, especially after last night... Henry whirled around in his chair to see Mark standing in the doorway, wearing a short-sleeve plaid shirt and jeans, with a black ball cap partly obscuring his eyes. Good night! Did Uncle Jack ever teach him how to knock? \"Oh, hey there, Mark,\" Jack said. His tone was somewhat uncomfortable at the idea of Mark having heard even part of his conversation with Henry. \"Dad.\" Mark gave a slight nod, acknowledging his father's presence. \"Is there something you want, son?\" Jack asked. Mark nodded and looked to Henry. \"Henry, everything's ready. It's time to move out.\" Henry turned and gave his uncle a questioning look. \"Go on,\" Jack said, nodding. He had a slight grin on his face. Henry rose from his seat, took a few steps toward the door, and then stopped. \"What are you guys doing out there now?\" \"A special project, Dad,\" Mark replied cryptically. \"Special project, eh? What'd you do now? Go and join Stanford when I wasn't looking?\" Jack asked, chuckling. Mark gave his father a Cheshire grin. Henry still just stood a few steps from the door. Truth be told, he'd rather stay and keep talking with his uncle. \"Hey, Henry. You coming or what?\" Mark asked. Henry glanced back at Jack. \"Go ahead,\" Jack said encouragingly. \"Don't feel like you have to stay on my account.\" If only you knew , Henry thought. He reluctantly followed Mark all the way out the front door and into the woods. Out here, it actually felt a bit warmer than yesterday, enough so that neither of them even needed a coat. But the air was still relatively cool, giving the environment a rather pleasant feel to it. Not at all like the feeling of apprehension building in the pit of Henry's stomach. As they wound through the woods on their way toward the bunker, Mark suddenly turned and started talking. \"Look – I'm really sorry about the dog,\" Mark said, his voice earnest and surprisingly sincere. \"I honestly didn't even mean to hurt it, let alone kill it. The whole thing was an accident. Honestly.\" Honestly ? Honestly, Henry didn't really know what to think, so he just absently nodded and kept on walking. Mark suddenly stopped in the middle of the trail and nodded in the direction of the house. \"If it'll make you feel any better, cuz, I can always go back in and tell my parents about the dog. But it'll get us both into a whole mess of trouble neither of us really want.\" Henry let out an exasperated sigh. To be perfectly honest with himself, he had survived the day since the little 'accident'. No one's wrath had descended upon him. Lightning hadn't struck, either. Unfortunately, Captain Lawson's dog was gone, and nothing he said or did could change that. \"Let's just forget about it,\" Henry said. Despite feeling wary, he was glad to be relieved of the boredom he'd felt when he had no one to goof off with. \"So, are we going on this hike or what?\" Mark grinned. \"That we are. We're just making a quick stop first.\" They reached the bunker and Mark started to open the doors. Henry reached for his arm and stopped. Mark turned, surprised. \"What?\" \"Can I trust you?\" Henry asked. His cousin just stared back at him. He knew what Henry meant: he didn't want any more trouble. \"Hey, man, we're blood brothers, remember?\" Like that was somehow meant to say, ' Of course you can trust me .' Henry shook his head as Mark slipped through the doors and into the dark void beyond. There was just something about the way Mark affected him. On the one hand, he was worried about what his older cousin might do next, and on the other, he couldn't wait to find out what he had planned. It was strange. He stepped inside and closed the doors just as Mark flicked on the overhead lights. The drone was still resting right where it had been the other day, but now a pair of backpacks sat on the floor at the foot of the table. Acting all businesslike, Mark shouldered one and passed the other to Henry without a word. For looking so full, the bag was surprisingly light as Henry slung it across his back, but he could tell there was something in there nonetheless. \"What are we gonna do with it?\" Henry asked, gesturing at the drone. Mark hefted it off the table and held it under one arm before responding. \"We're going to be taking some flying lessons,\" Mark replied with a grin, his tone cryptic. Just like usual. At this point, Henry was going against his better judgment, which was telling him to back out. But what could it hurt to at least see what Mark had planned with the drone? At the first sign of trouble, he'd back out. Outside, a slight breeze had kicked up, and every now and then, the sun would be partly obscured by banks of white clouds, casting shadows through the trees and underbrush around the boys. Mark led the way through the woods until they came to the stone wall at the edge of the road. They both carefully vaulted over it and ran across the road, at which point they turned to walk alongside it, heading in the opposite direction of town. About five minutes on, the strange feeling in the pit of Henry's stomach returned. Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe he shouldn't have agreed to this so readily. Even worse, he'd basically agreed to it two days ago, before the incident with the dog, and before he'd truly had an indication that there was something about Mark that wasn't quite right. Now, here he was, trapped in one of his cousin's schemes. He could always back out, but he didn't want to leave Mark all on his own in the middle of nowhere. \"Where are we going?\" Henry asked after walking in silence for a few minutes longer. \"It's not much farther,\" Mark casually replied. Just up ahead on their right, a narrow gravel road cut down through the rocks and led up into a massive stand of evergreens. Mark veered off the main road and started up the incline, with Henry following. The trees up here cast deep shadows, with surprisingly little light getting through from above. The general feeling that it gave off was rather eerie. At least, that's the way Henry felt. They passed a slight curve in the overgrown, trail-like road, and not far ahead, their path abruptly ended at a rusted old guardrail. Just beyond was an overhang of rock that jutted out over a fairly deep ravine. Mark stopped and kneeled behind the guardrail before taking off his backpack. Henry did the same. Roughly a quarter mile to their left, an arched concrete bridge spanned the ravine. Every minute, cars would whizz by on it, either heading into or out of town. Henry watched as Mark opened his own bag and removed a medium-sized glass jar with a metal lid. It was filled with some kind of golden-yellow liquid. Mark then flipped the drone onto its back, opened the grappling claws on the underbelly, and carefully affixed them around the jar. \"What are you doing?\" Henry asked. His curiosity – and dread – was steadily growing. \"Like I said,\" Mark replied as he flipped the drone so that it now rested atop the jar. \"We're getting in some flying lessons today. Now, open up your bag.\" Henry unzipped his bag and removed a tablet from inside. It had been wedged between two pillows to prevent any damage. \"Isn't this part of your computer?\" Henry asked as he handed the tablet to Mark. \"Sure is,\" Mark replied. \"It's one of the only things that can control these quadrotors.\" Within seconds, he had the device up and running. With that, the drone suddenly buzzed to life, its' four small props quickly spinning up. \"What do you think?\" Mark asked, looking to over at Henry. Henry simply nodded in approval. With a deft touch of a finger to the screen, Mark had the drone hovering roughly five or six feet off the ground, though not without some effort from its' mystery cargo. Then the small craft took off over the ravine, heading for another stand of tall evergreens on the opposite side. \"Don't these things have cameras?\" Mark nodded and held the tablet so Henry could see. More than half of the screen was taken up by a surprisingly sharp and focused view from the perspective of the drone. Every second, the trees on the opposite side got closer and closer, until it stopped amongst them, blocking out its' view of the highway. \"What are you doing?\" Henry asked. Now he was just plain puzzled. For the better part of a minute, Mark didn't respond, and, he kept the drone hovering just inside the cover of the trees. This just kept getting stranger, almost by the second. And, Henry didn't like it. Not one bit. Finally, Mark began to maneuver the drone through the trees and back into view of the highway. What's going on now? Car watching? Henry got his answer sooner than he would have liked. Mark suddenly turned the drone in the direction of the bridge and angled it downward ever so slightly. \"What are you doing now ?\" Henry asked. Still, just like last time, Mark remained eerily silent. Henry's feeling of dread refused to go away, no matter how hard he tried. \"Lesson Number One,\" Mark said. \" Always know what you're doing.\" Henry cocked his head. \"What?\" With that, Mark opened up the throttle to full, and the drone shot ahead far faster than it had before. Too late, Henry had a flash of realization, and he could do nothing but watch helplessly through the camera as the drone barreled toward the roadway below it at full speed. The ground rushed up toward the small craft, seeming to embrace it, and then the display turned to pure static. A/N: I hope you all liked this chapter. Ch. 13 - What We've Done shouldn't take too long. Stay tuned. And keep the reviews coming! From this point on, Henry's trust for Mark will be virtually non-existent. And, any guesses as to what was in that jar Mark attached to the drone? You'll find out soon enough.[Chapter 13] Chapter 13 - What We've Done At a speed of very near a hundred miles-an-hour, the drone slammed into the roadbed of the bridge, and in the space of a split second, a brief, but intense red and yellow-orange fireball erupted at the point of impact. Horrified drivers slammed on their brakes, sending cars fishtailing and careening across both lanes of California SR 1. An oncoming car in the southbound lane collided head-on with one of the first cars that had swerved to avoid the explosion. Another car from the southbound lane swerved to avoid the first two cars, and ended up t-boning a fourth car in the opposite lane, completely blocking off the bridge. Henry watched from afar in frozen horror. Someone was going to be horribly maimed, or even worse, killed. All because of him. If only he had known... Out of his peripheral vision, he could see Mark staring at the unfolding carnage on the bridge, in an eerily similar and even more so disturbing fashion to when he'd killed the dog yesterday. He was enraptured, and worse, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying it. Another two northbound cars piled into the third, sending it skidding further down the bridge and eventually flipping onto its' side. Beyond that, two more cars had slammed into each other and for a time were locked in a weird, violent, skidding dance before finally crashing headlong into the guardrail. Next was a minivan that rear ended one of those two, sending the front end of the other smashing clear through the guardrail and leaving the front wheels spinning uselessly over empty space. Then came a pickup towing a powerboat on a trailer. Its' brakes locked and the tires squealed, burning a streak of rubber into the pavement. The trailer began to fishtail slightly as both it and the truck skidded sideways and careened into the growing pileup. One last unlucky car t-boned the truck at the joint with the trailer, snapping them apart and very nearly sending the boat flying. And then it was finally over. Eleven dented and mangled vehicles sat at all sorts of strange angles in both lanes of the highway, the sun glinting off millions of tiny shards of glass that now littered the asphalt. For a moment, everything was eerily still. The only sounds were the blaring of several stuck horns and steam hissing from sprung and crumpled hoods. Then another, far more terrible noise, distant and faint among all the others, reached Henry's ears. The sound of children wailing in fear. Was a child hurt? Or dead? Henry felt a chill, but it was not from the shadows of the forest that surrounded them. Rather, it was from a deep-seated feeling of guilt beginning to well up inside of him, and a suddenly sickness in the pit of his stomach. This was not what he had bargained for. Not at all. Mark had tricked him. Tears began to form at the corners of his eyes, clouding his vision. Then Henry felt someone tugging at the back of his shirt. It had to be Mark, but Henry simply could not look at him. People began to emerge from their wrecked vehicles, running to try and help others who were trapped. Wiping the tears from his eyes, Henry looked up and saw that cars had stopped in both lanes and were starting to back up as far as he could see in either direction. Those people in the cars closest to the accident had gotten out. Some just stood and watched on in shock, while others ran toward the battered and tangled mess of cars to see if they could help. \"Come on ,\" Henry heard Mark say as he tugged on his sleeve again, impatience audibly rising in his voice as he hurriedly began repacking their bags. But Henry remained rooted to the spot. What he was seeing... It was...awful. It was amazing, and even miraculous to Henry that, for the moment, no one appeared to be seriously injured. He was still concerned about whoever had to be in the car that had breached the guardrail and now teetered precariously over the ravine. Now several people who had seemed to regain their composure started toward the north end of the bridge, and the smoking pile of melted wreckage that had once been Mark's drone. Mark smacked Henry in the back of the head. \"Stop standing around like a window dummy and COME ON !\" he hissed angrily, shoving the empty backpack into Henry's arms. Then he took off running down the trail. Henry quickly shouldered the bag, and had no choice but to follow. As they ran, Mark jumped into the air with a voice of triumph and shouted, \"Did you SEE that?! Dozens of cars!\" He looked over at Henry. \"We did it!\" We?! Henry was filled with a miserable mix of remorse and dread. How had it happened? How could he have even been a part of it? Suddenly Henry felt a hand grab his arm and pull him to a stop, near where the tree line finally ended. Mark stood beside him stock-still, listening. At first, Henry didn't hear anything. All he was aware of was the cool darkness oppressively surrounding him. Then he heard it: the sound of distant emergency sirens, getting closer by the second, and a low droning noise that Henry couldn't immediately identify. Within seconds, he spied a brief flash of red and blue through the trees, and Mark's grip on his arm tightened in anxiety. \"This way!\" Mark gasped as he suddenly dragged Henry further along the trail, as if back toward the highway. \"Where are we going ?!\" Henry asked, his voice equally confused and fearful at the same time. Off to the left of the trail was a huge, weather-worn boulder. Mark dragged them both behind the giant rock and instantly crouched down behind it, while Henry just stood there as if in a daze. \"Get down!\" Mark hissed, yanking at Henry's arm and pulling him almost to the ground. The blaring sirens of the emergency vehicles, as well as that strange, low droning noise were both growing louder. \"I – I didn't know... I didn't... I couldn't have... why did you... what...\" Henry said, jabbering and stuttering in fits and starts, overcome by a heavy feeling of remorse. \"Just shut up,\" Mark hissed through clenched teeth. Moments later, two squad cars, a fire truck, and an ambulance went blasting by on the highway below, their wailing and pulsing sirens nearly deafening Henry in the process. He stayed crouched behind the boulder in miserable, stunned silence. How could this have happened? How? The whole thing was starting to spin out of control into an almost movie-level nightmare. Why did Mark do it? The bigger question is, why did he seem to enjoy it? Like with the dog ... His cousin had to be crazy, plain and simple. Anyone twisted enough to enjoy other people's pain and suffering had to be. The last of the emergency vehicles roared by on the road below, but that droning noise was now fairly loud in its' own right and seemed to be coming from right above. Henry sat down hard in the dirt and stared up into the sky as an oblong gray object that tapered to a small point at the front emerged into view above. It was a zeppelin, with markings that identified it as belonging to Mendocino County PD. As soon as the zeppelin had half-propelled itself, half-drifted out over the water and began heading in the direction of the 'accident', Henry felt a hand fall onto his shoulder. His head jerked up and to the side. He found himself staring into Mark's eerily calm face and that ever-confident, disarming grin. It was disturbing. Henry stared into his eyes, incredulous. \"Hey, relax, man,\" Mark said nonchalantly, his voice smooth and unperturbed. \"Nobody got hurt.\" \"As far as we know . But – but, that's not the point here,\" Henry replied. \"Wait – I didn't know that those drivers would react like that. I mean, they just totally lost it,\" Mark said, his tone and attitude suddenly filled with an all-too unlikely innocence. Henry's composure finally snapped. \"Do you know what you did?!\" he angrily cried out, his voice seething with suppressed rage. \"You just basically committed an act of terrorism!\" The smile on Mark 's face surprised him, but shouldn't have. \"What I did? Terrorism? Hey, come on, man. We did it together!\" A sudden wave of panic engulfed Henry. \"We – we could go to jail! The FBI's probably gonna be out here by tonight!\" he cried. Mark just shrugged and nodded. His tone was calm. \"Probably sooner, too. But will they have any evidence linking it to us specifically? No. I made absolutely certain of that.\" Henry's jaw dropped. \"Besides,\" Mark said, \"I thought you said that you liked explosions!\" \"I – I do, but n-not this kind!\" Henry stuttered. \"This could have actually killed someone!\" Mark nodded. \"Exactly.\" Henry just stared back at him, speechless. Mark finally stood to his feet and gave Henry a seemingly impenetrable grin. It was unnatural the way he acted. Reluctantly, Henry followed and walked out far ahead of Mark, trying as best as he could to ignore him. As they were walking along the road, back the way they had come, a series of tow trucks rumbled by, heading in the direction of the bridge. Not far behind the boys, a traffic jam was slowly and continually building. The blaring of car horns rose up in the distance, their drivers' curiosity seemingly replaced by impatience and annoyance. Unfortunately for them, and many other people, their wait would not be over anytime soon. So much hardship and damage and pain. And Mark thought that it was nothing but a big joke. For the rest of the afternoon and all through the evening, Henry was once again quiet. At dinner, he barely even touched his food. His stomach felt as though it were in a knot: a knot of guilt over what had happened, confusion over what to do about it, and fear of what would happen next. Specifically, what would Mark do next? What was going on in that twisted brain of his? When Janice noticed her older nephew's supposed lack of appetite, she asked if he was okay. Henry almost told her about that afternoon, but somehow, he simply couldn't bring himself to say it. He couldn't. Not to her, anyway. How would Mark react? He'd more than likely deny it. Instead, Henry made up a little story about eating some candy in town earlier that must have ruined his appetite. All through the meal, Mark seemed to stare at him. But it wasn't as if he was worried or scared that Henry might say something. Every time Henry glanced in his direction, Mark looked back with an almost bemused expression on his face. Almost as if he was daring Henry to say something. Not wanting to face Mark again after dinner, Henry decided to help Janice clean up. She was standing at the sink, rinsing dishes before placing them in the dishwasher. Henry sidled up beside her and began scraping leftover food from the plates into the disposal with a metal spatula. \"Oh, Henry... You don't have to help, dear,\" Janice said. \"It's no trouble. Besides, I want to,\" Henry replied. \"I can take care of this,\" Janice said. \"Why don't you go off and play with Mark or your sibs for a little while?\" Henry simply shrugged. Janice glanced over at him and frowned. \"Is something bothering you, Henry?\" When he didn't respond, Janice pressed another question, but gently. \"Is it because your dad hasn't called for a few days? Or is it Richard's little letdown yesterday afternoon?\" No. Neither of those was the reason. His father had called them after landing in Hong Kong, and had warned Henry that it might be difficult to call for the next several days. He'd be very busy. And, the time difference was such that even when he could call, Henry would probably be sound asleep. As for Richard, Henry still worried about him, like usual, but he'd given his little brother that good talking-to and hopefully, an equally good reason to keep his mind occupied until their father returned. Henry certainly couldn't tell his aunt the real reason as to why he had been so silent and gloomy since that afternoon, so he just decided to use his father as one. \"Sort of,\" Henry replied, shrugging. Janice nodded, her features and tone clearly sympathetic. \"I imagine it's not easy for you, Connie, or Richard.\" Henry nodded back. Strange... I completely forgot about everything with Dad . What with this new issue taking center stage and all ... Mark . By now, the temptation to tell Janice was almost overwhelming. But how could I? Just like yesterday at lunch, Henry realized just why he couldn't say anything. Despite how friendly his aunt had been, not to mention that strange connection he'd felt when they first met, he was still a stranger in this house. And, they hardly knew each other. Not exactly ideal conditions – as if there ever were – for telling a mother that her firstborn was a potential killer. \"Did your father say when he'd call back?\" Janice asked. \"When he had the time,\" Henry said. \"I understand that it's hard for him. He's got a lot to do while he's over there.\" Janice nodded and smiled slightly. \"It's good that you understand that, Henry. A lot of boys your age wouldn't.\" \"It kinda helps that I have a lot to do on my own, too,\" Henry replied, a knowing look on his face. His aunt then abruptly changed topics. \"Will you be ready to leave later?\" she asked. \"What for? The concert?\" Janice nodded. \"Don't worry about me,\" Henry said. \"I'll just need to make sure Connie and Rich are.\" \"I appreciate your support, Henry. It means a lot to me.\" Henry gave her a little smile. \"You're welcome. I know a worthy cause when I see one.\" Even after the dishes were finally done, Henry sat at the counter on one of the bar stools, pretending to surf the Internet on his phone. He was really just trying to avoid Mark for as long as humanly possible. Janice and Chloe were on the sofa out in the living room, with Chloe snuggled up against her mother, fully absorbed in the contents of her e-reader, while Janice absently kept her eyes on the news, with the volume muted. The TV out there was a huge 55-inch LCD with a top-of-the-line sound system, and consequently anything seen or heard on it was rather hard to miss. As Mark came into the room, he tripped over his own feet and fell to the floor, taking the TV remote with him and 'accidentally' turning the volume back on. He profusely apologized to his mother and kept on walking. Henry was reading an article on his phone about Sony's recently announced 'PlayStation' video game console, due out late next year, when he heard something about a suspected militia bombing and eleven-car pileup closing down a section of SR 1. Henry looked up from his phone and took a peek at the TV. What he saw on there made the blood drain from his face. The bridge, clogged with the wrecks of nearly a dozen vehicles. One lane on either end, with long, single-file lines of cars waiting for the road to reopen. The car that had breached the guardrail being pulled to safety by a tow truck. Finally, groups of people swarming over the scorched impact site. Probably the FBI. The TV crew must have shot the scene from an overflying helicopter or zeppelin. Now the scene on the TV abruptly switched from day to night, and the view changed to one on the ground. A woman with light brown hair then stepped in front of the camera. In the background, a string of light poles on either side of the road lit up the highway and cars occasionally flashed by. \"What you just saw was the scene over this stretch of the SR 1 for many hours earlier today. Traffic was backed-up in both the north and southbound lanes for many miles on either side of the bridge. But as you can see now, things are at last moving along at a normal pace. Sherriff Vincent of the Mendocino County Police Department says it was nothing short of a miracle that no one was seriously injured.\" The scene now jumped back to the studio, and the woman alongside the highway became a face on a newsroom monitor. A silver-haired man attired in a plain gray suit was sitting at a news desk and faced the monitor. \"Now, Jane, there hasn't been any official word from the FBI, correct?\" the man asked. The woman nodded. \"That's correct. But sentiments among some of the locals and victims of the accident are that this attack was the responsibility of one of the regional militia groups.\" Militia! Henry's grip on his phone tightened and he quickly shoved it into his jeans pocket. He suddenly felt sick to his stomach. That feeling only intensified when Mark strode out into the kitchen and retrieved a can of Mug Root Beer from the fridge. The boys locked eyes, and Mark gave Henry a knowing smile. Henry shuddered involuntarily and felt goose bumps run down his arms and a sudden chill race up his spine. He couldn't stand it! He had to get away from Mark. Now. Henry bolted from the kitchen and toward the stairs, nearly slipping on the floor in the process. He scrambled up the stairs, feet thudding on the carpet. Janice looked up and watched Henry disappear onto the upstairs landing. She raised an eyebrow, bewildered. What was that all about? Maybe he isn't all right, despite what he keeps claiming , she thought. But in any case, I should probably wait before talking with him again . Then Mark walked in, sipping from the can of soda. Janice turned to her son. \"Mark. Any idea what's going on with Henry?\" Mark shook his head. \"None. But now that you mention it, he's been acting kinda strange for the past couple of days. If you want, I can go see if he's okay.\" His mother gave him a smile. \"That'd be very nice of you, hon.\" Mark smiled back at Janice and started toward the stairs, his soda still in hand. Just out of sight on the upstairs landing, Henry heard Mark's footsteps ascending the stairs, and immediately made a beeline for Mark's room. He didn't know what he was going to do now. Only that he had to do something . This wasn't a game anymore. Mark was crazy, and now he had turned against Henry. As soon as he was inside Mark's room, Henry shut the door behind him. He was tempted to lock it. He turned on the lights. He had to think, had to figure out a way to deal with this. Henry walked over to one of the windows and stared out over the darkened yard, his gaze blank. A few seconds later, he heard footsteps in the hall. Then a slight creak as the door opened. \"Ah-ha. There you are,\" Mark said, as if he'd found some kind of prize. Henry stiffened involuntarily. His cousin was really starting to give him the creeps. More footsteps. Then the scuffling of wood against the carpet as Mark pulled out the chair in front of his workbench. Henry turned slightly and glanced out of the corner of his eye. Mark was sitting backwards in the chair, grinning like a Cheshire cat. \"So, Henry... I told Janice that I'd see if you were okay. Are you?\" Mark asked. Those words were underlain by a distinct tone of malice and mocking laughter. Henry's older cousin knew that he had won. This round. And 'Janice'?! She's his mother for crying out loud! Why would he call her by her name? Henry asked himself. No answer was readily forthcoming. \"Leave me alone,\" Henry muttered under his breath. \"Leave you alone?\" Mark asked in an amused tone, chuckling slightly as he downed the rest of his root beer. \"This is my room.\" Henry shook his head. Just ignore him , he thought. Wait until Dad returns, and then I can get Connie and Rich out of this crazy place once and for all . Jack's house had gone from a place where Henry could feel comfortable to just plain awkward and Mark had gone from being a friend to an undeclared enemy in less than twenty-four hours. \"Did you see the TV?\" Mark asked. Henry sat down in Mark's desk chair and stared over at his cousin. \"You could have killed people today,\" Henry muttered angrily. \"With your help,\" Mark replied. \"Wait a second. I – I didn't know you were going to do that!\" Henry protested. Mark raised an eyebrow. \"Really? I think you were kind of encouraging me all the way, Henry.\" Henry stared at him, dumbfounded. \"I mean, I didn't do anything like this until you came along,\" Mark said. Henry's jaw dropped so far he almost had to pick it up off the floor. \"But don't worry,\" Mark said, his voice casual. \"I won't tell anyone as long as you don't.\" At that moment, Henry stood up from the chair fast enough to send it spinning, strode over to Mark, and seized him by the arm. \"You're sick!\" Henry hissed through his teeth, now barely suppressing his rage. Mark spoke at him in an eerily calm voice, not inches from his face. \"Hey, I promised you something truly amazing. Something you'd never forget... where's the friggin' gratitude?\" Gratitude?! In the space of a split second, Mark tried to lever a hand under Henry's chin, and Henry spun away, dragging Mark with him. The boys were soon locked together in a fierce wrestling match, tumbling, rolling, and crashing around on Mark's floor. Several times, someone would pin the other down in an attempt to end the battle, but each time, someone else would regain the upper hand. It was just short of throwing punches. Now there was another set of footsteps out in the hall. Lighter ones. It was Chloe, and she now stood just inside the open doorway, wearing her school clothes and looking mildly uncomfortable. \"Guys, you should get dressed. Mom says it's almost time to leave,\" she said. The boys abruptly froze in mid-fight, with Mark having pinned Henry to the floor, an arm pressing down on his throat and a knee on his chest. \"Chloe?\" Mark said tersely, letting Henry go and standing to his feet. \"Yup?\" Chloe replied, nervously bouncing a little on her feet. \"What did I tell you about coming into my room?\" her brother asked as he advanced, glowering. \"But you weren't working on anything. You guys were just wrestling around on the floor.\" Mark cupped both hands and tightly gripped either side of his sister's neck. \"Ow!\" Chloe yelped. \"That hurts. Let go.\" Mark held tight while his sister squirmed in pain. \"Please, Mark,\" she cried. \"You're hurting me!\" \"You didn't answer my question,\" Mark said, completely ignoring her. \"So, I'll have to do it for you. You are not allowed in here. Not even an inch. This is not your place. You never, never, never, set foot in –\" He didn't get the chance to finish the sentence as Henry grabbed him by the throat and yanked him backward, forcing Mark to release Chloe. A look of surprise formed on Chloe's face. No one had ever stood up to Mark like this. \"Urggh...\" A gurgling noise came from Mark's throat as he tried to pry Henry's hands off his neck. Henry forced him across the room and slammed his cousin as hard as he could against the bunk bed ladder, briefly dazing Mark. Henry glared into Mark's surprised face. \"You're wrong...\" Henry said vehemently, once again, barely able to contain his fury. \"This is my room, too... and I say she can stay!\" Mark managed to pry Henry's hands away from his neck. The boys glared at each other. And as Henry felt his hands lose their grip, he quickly reached up, grabbed two handfuls of Mark's hair and pulled. Mark almost instantly did the same. They were locked together with their heads tilted down, like a pair of rams in battle, each with a grip on the other's hair. But neither of them was prepared to let go, or to give in and acknowledge the pain. \"Mom! Mom!\" Henry heard Chloe shout and run out of the room. The pain was agonizing, but Henry wouldn't let go. It felt as if Mark was trying to rip his scalp off. Unwanted tears forced their way from Henry's eyes, but he refused to give in to this certifiable nutcase who called himself his cousin. Both of their heads soon began to twist in opposite directions, faces red and contorted with equal parts' pain and determination. \"So, you like my little sister, do you?\" Mark asked in a low voice, his words now taking on an almost fiendish quality. \"Drop dead,\" Henry replied, practically spitting the words out. \"You like doing jigsaws with her, don't you? Well... isn't that a shame. Your sister likes playing dolls with her? Aah, the little dollies... Isn't it all just too sad? Such sweet little kids – I hope that nothing happens to either of them – it would be such a pity.\" Henry stared at Mark in growing horror. \"I bet that you'd be sad. Wouldn't you, Henry?\" From anyone else it would have been just another idle threat. But from Mark... who knew? It could very well be real. Why should he stop at killing dogs and almost killing total strangers? Besides, Henry already knew that Mark couldn't stand sharing things, either. Why should that stop at baseballs and jackets? Now it seemed to include Chloe, too, despite the fact that he essentially hated her. Even worse, Mark had included Connie as well. It made no sense. There were simply no limits with Henry's cousin. Mark did anything he wanted to do. \"You wouldn't dare!\" Henry gasped, as much from shock as the pain. The thought was incredible – that Mark would seriously try to hurt either of their little sisters. \"Hey, accidents happen,\" Mark said in a low, nasty chuckle vaguely reminiscent of Freddy Krueger. \"Just ask my mom about little Matty.\" Henry's eyes widened in surprise. Mark wasn't actually admitting that he... \"You're sick,\" Henry whispered back, his tone shocked. \"Mark! Henry!\" Janice's astonished voice startled them. The boys instantly let each other go and stood to face the door, where Mark's mother stood with Chloe behind her, staring at them. Janice was wearing her green dress and had her hair up in a ponytail. \"Are you two fighting?\" Janice asked, stepping into the room. Then she turned toward her son. \"Mark?\" Mark stepped toward his mother, and abruptly transformed himself from the crazy, malicious tormentor that Henry now knew him to be, into the smiling and ever-charming young boy who could somehow do no wrong in the eyes of his mother. He clasped his hands behind his back and stood in front of Janice, staring innocently up into her eyes. \"Aw... I'm sorry, Mom. We were playing this really dumb game – pulling hair to see who would say 'Ow' first. We weren't fighting at all. We were in it together... Weren't we, Henry?\" Mark asked, staring back at him. Henry could feel Janice's gaze land on him. He desperately wanted to say something, to tell his aunt the truth, but once again, he knew that she probably wouldn't believe him. He scratched at his head, and then looked over at Janice. \"That's right – it was just a stupid game,\" Henry muttered. Janice looked relieved. Mark's face lit up in a huge grin. \"We didn't really mean to upset Chloe, did we? Sorry, sis,\" he said, affectionately wrapping his arm around his sister's shoulders and giving her a little squeeze. To Henry, Chloe looked a bit uncomfortable, but she put on a forced smile nonetheless. \"I'm glad you feel that way, honey,\" Janice said. \"Just don't play so rough, okay? For a second there, I thought you two were trying to kill each other.\" If only she knew how close she was to the truth ... \"Now, you both should get ready to leave. Dress appropriately, but don't go too formal. We leave for the school at nine.\" \"Got it, Mom,\" Mark replied, giving her a thumbs-up sign. As Janice and Chloe turned and left the room, Mark looked back at Henry with a triumphant grin. Then as Henry glared back at him with a mixture of anger and fear, he suddenly remembered what Mark had said about Chloe and Connie. \"Don't you even think of doing anything to your sister – or mine . You got that?\" Henry said, growling. Mark just gave him a contemptuous smirk and walked out of the room with a smug air about him. This was all beginning to spiral out of control. And Henry had no idea of how to stop it. A/N: Keep the reviews coming! With this chapter posted, the story's roughly halfway finished. (I'm currently planning another twelve chapters or so, and then the epilogue). Stay tuned - Chapter 14: For Whose Benefit? is next up.[Chapter 14] Chapter 14 - For Whose Benefit? \"Where's Dad?\" Chloe asked Janice as they all headed out to the van. \"He went ahead to help set up,\" Janice replied, her voice mildly terse. Chloe's face suddenly fell. \"Did I do something wrong, Mom?\" Her mother was taken slightly aback at this question. Janice kneeled in front of Chloe and laid a hand on her daughter's shoulder. \"Of course not,\" Janice said. \"Why would you think that, darling?\" Chloe shrugged. \"I don't know... it's just...\" \"You did absolutely nothing wrong, Chloe,\" Janice said, her voice reassuring. \"I shouldn't have answered you like that.\" \"Then does it have something to do with Dad?\" Janice visibly stiffened, but said nothing. Chloe looked concerned. \"Mom, are you okay?\" Janice nodded and promptly ushered her daughter into the van. \"I'm fine.\" As the eight year-old buckled her seatbelt, she stared at her mother in bewilderment. This wasn't entirely new, but it still surprised Chloe nonetheless. Her mother's strange attitude had started roughly a year or so ago, around the same time as this whole beach thing. General irritability, especially a tendency to get angry over such trivial things as the garbage, had become an unfortunately common occurrence. But what really set Janice off was one Miss Joan Michaels, though for what reason Chloe couldn't quite discern. Ignorance was probably Chloe's only saving grace from being caught in the middle of what was going on between her and Mark's parents. And while for the most part, Chloe thought that the whole beach issue was boring, she didn't want to lose the beach itself and all the happy summer days spent there. As a result, she had decided to use her slowly growing talent for piano and put it to good use. If only Mark could have been a bit more supportive. Pigs would sooner fly ... she thought, inwardly scoffing at the very idea of her older brother doing anything nice on her behalf. There were a lot of people here. Richard fidgeted in his seat beside Henry, already not liking it in this school. And he didn't even go here, either. \"You all right there, buddy?\" Henry asked. Richard just shrugged, merely avoiding his big brother's gaze. Henry laid a hand on Richard's shoulder. \"C'mon... I know you, Rich. I know when something's up.\" \"Why did I have to come?\" Richard suddenly blurted out, causing several people to look in his direction. Henry ignored the glances of the other people and suppressed a sigh. \"I told you earlier, Rich. Aunt Janice couldn't find anybody to babysit you and Conse tonight.\" \"I'm not a baby!\" Richard protested, with his lower lip curling into a frown. \"I'm four!\" Henry brought a finger to his lips. \"Not so loud, okay?\" Richard crossed his arms and stared up into Henry's eyes. Easy for HIM to say! You're the big guy here, Henny. But Henry's answer hadn't been the one Richard was looking for. Why did he have to come at all? Why did Daddy have to leave them all for so long? Why did Mommy... Mommy ... Richard's pouting face suddenly broke and crumpled into a rather distinct expression of sadness, his lower lip trembling and tears brimming behind his eyes. \"Hey, hey... why are you crying, buddy?\" Mommy ... The four year-old suddenly sobbed and buried his face in Henry's shoulder. It was all too much! To make matters worse, people were starting to stare. Once again ignoring their annoyed looks, Henry put an arm around Richard's shoulder and wordlessly led him down the aisle between the chairs and out of the auditorium. They sat in a pair of worn, padded chairs just down the hall. Richard's shoulders heaved as he sobbed and clung tightly to his big brother. Henry gently rocked him back and forth in an effort to try and calm him, unfortunately, without much success. Henry didn't even have to ask why his brother was now crying. He knew why. And it wasn't coming here, to the concert. This had merely been the final straw for Richard Evans. \"Wh-why?\" Richard asked, his voice trembling and choked with tears. Henry looked at him curiously. \"'Why' what?\" \"Why d-did M-Mommy have to go away? And n-now Daddy's gone, too! It's n-not fair to us!\" Henry was left speechless. For once, he didn't know what to say, and now, he began to feel like Janice must've a few days ago when she had comforted him. Before, whenever Richard, or Connie, for that matter, were like this, they would have gone to their mother (and occasionally, their father) for support and kind words. Henry had both of those qualities, too, but he didn't quite know how to use them in the correct way. Frankly, he had been lucky that his talk with Richard the other day had gone so well. To make matters worse, Henry wasn't entirely over their mother's passing, but he knew that their father was going to come back, no matter what. Just how soon was, unfortunately, a whole other matter entirely. He'd just have to do his best, and hope for the right outcome. \"Hey, Rich – it's going to be okay, buddy.\" \"H-how do you know?\" the little boy asked, his tone almost accusatory. \"You wanna know how I know?\" Richard nodded, sniffling and wiping the tears from his reddened eyes. \"I know, because I know Dad – he promised that he'd come back. And , because I know you and Connie. When most people pass either of you on the street, all they see is just another couple of little kids. But what I see is my little bro and sis, strong and grown-up well beyond their years.\" \"R-really?\" Richard asked, his eyes wide. Henry gave him a little grin. \"You betcha. You've both handled everything in these past two weeks better than most kids your age would've. And I'm proud of you for that, Rich. I really am.\" \"Then how come you haven't shown it?\" Henry started, taken aback at the question. \"What on earth do you mean by that?\" \"How many times have you said that you'd play with me and Connie and you have not? Like with the puzzle.\" Henry should have expected this. All the times he had meant to play with Richard and Connie, and Mark had dragged him off into another misadventure every single time! Almost like Mark knew that this would happen. He took a deep breath and turned to Richard. \"Believe me, Rich. I meant what I said – but I guess I got a little too caught up in hanging with Mark. I'm sorry I haven't been there for you as much as I should have.\" The look that Richard gave him was his ' And you know it ' look. \"You know that if I did hurt you in any way, I never, ever meant to do anything of the sort. And I truly am sorry. Can you forgive me, Rich?\" Richard appeared to ponder over the question for a time, then he finally gave a slow nod. \"I forgive you, Henny...\" he mumbled. Henry let off an internal sigh. So close... But even a mumbled ' I forgive you ' was better than none at all, so he'd just have to accept it and leave it at that for now. \"Hey, Henny?\" \"What, Rich?\" Richard gave him a slight wince and suddenly squirmed in his seat. \"Can we find the bathroom?\" Henry chuckled at that and led his little brother in the direction of the bathrooms. While he waited for Richard outside the men's room, Henry did his best to sift through the many questions and thoughts that were now flying through his head. Man, where's Dad when you need him? What's gotten into Rich? Is my best not good enough for him anymore? Is that it? Well, you aren't a parent, Henry. Even you're just barely making do without one around right now, and Connie and Richard were hard enough for Mom and Dad to deal with, even when everything was just fine . Now, you're trying to fill two roles for them, and it's slowing you down . It's just like Uncle Jack said – you've got too much on your plate right now. Then I should probably take a step back . If taking on both Mom and Dad's roles right now is slowing me down, then I need to figure out which one best suits me, before I get so distracted that I don't notice anything else . \"Henry!\" someone yelled in his ear. Henry jumped to the side and threw his hands up in front of his face. Speaking of getting distracted ... It was Mark, wearing a grin that should have split his face wide open. \"Aghh!\" Henry growled, shuddering. \"Don't do that!\" Mark shrugged. \"And why not? I was doing you a favor, friend.\" Friend?! I'm not your friend ... \"A favor?! How in the world were you doing me a 'favor' by almost giving me a heart attack when I'm in the sixth grade?!\" \"Hey, I thought you were catatonic or something. Just trying to snap you out of it was all.\" Henry glared over at Mark. Ha. Yeah, I'll bet . \"So...\" Mark said, \"What's up with Richard?\" Henry scoffed. \"Why and since when do you care? He's not your little brother. And even if he was, you'd just do the same things to him that you do to Chloe.\" Mark raised an eyebrow and spoke in a dry, humorless tone. \"Oh, really? What exactly do I do to Chloe? Allegedly, that is.\" Allegedly?! \"You wanna go there? Fine. You treat her like she's lower than dirt and you brush her off like a bug when she says something you don't care for. Or how about when she picked up the baseball the day we climbed the tree? Or when she came into your room earlier tonight?\" Mark just shrugged and gave him a seemingly clueless look. \"Hey, she was the one who picked up that baseball without asking. And, she knows that she isn't allowed in my room, period. But... I have to tell her practically every week. I swear that she has short term memory loss.\" \"Maybe that's because you beat it all out of her,\" Henry remarked rather snidely. \"Prove it,\" Mark said, as if he were daring him. Knowing him, he probably is . Henry simply glared at him, while Mark put on his most annoying and cocky smile. \"Thought so,\" Mark scoffed, folding his arms across his chest and savoring yet another small victory. For the past couple of minutes, Richard had been standing stock still and silent just inside the bathroom door, listening to the conversation between his brother and Mark. All of a sudden, the two of them had stopped being friends, just like that. Not only that, they were being mean to each other. From what he could tell, they had been getting along great, and been like best friends, just like Henry was with Dylan and Eli back home. But there was something different about Mark. Something wrong. Something that most definitely set him apart from any of Henry's real friends – he was what someone might call a habit-u-al liar. Even stranger was the way that lying seemed to make Mark happy. He had heard Henny – no, Hen- ry , he had to remind himself – call it 'weird' before. Then, ever weirder was hearing Henry talk about him being Mark's little brother. I'm not Mark's little brother! Mark already has – or rather, had – a little brother of his own: Matt-hew, or, 'little Matty' . Richard had heard it both ways. But Matt-hew had drowned in his bathtub a long, long time ago, almost before Richard's own time. That was really sad. Richard felt sorry for his Uncle Jack's family, especially after seeing Chloe's sad face when she told him and Connie about it. She had also 'confided' in them about how Mark treated her. He was really, really mean to her, and was only nice to her when their parents were around, so he wouldn't get in trouble for it. Not only that, but whenever she had tried to tell her parents, they didn't believe her at all. Richard was starting to get the feeling that he was caught in the middle of a very big and very bad mess. \"Hey, Rich! You okay in there?\" Henry called out. Richard inhaled sharply, heaved the bathroom door open, and walked out. He froze and his eyes went as big as saucers when he saw the looks being exchanged between Mark and his brother. They were some of the meanest looks that Richard had ever seen. He was so scared right now that Mark and Henry may as well have been fire-breathing devils. Trying as best he could to be brave, he went over to his brother and tugged on his shirt, but Henry seemed to ignore him. Henry almost never ignored him. Maybe being a bit more insistent would work. It had worked with Daddy in the past. Richard took hold of Henry's hand and tugged on it, hard, but his big brother was still ignoring him, for whatever reason. What was going on here?! Richard was starting to get desperate. And, as I've heard Hen- ry say, 'desperate times call for desperate measures' ... With that, Richard head-butted Henry in the stomach. Henry wheezed and doubled over, gasping for breath. \"Rich... why... what did you do that for?\" he croaked. \"You were ignoring me, Henny. You was scaring me!\" Henry took in a sharp breath and kneeled in front of Richard. \"Don't you ever do that again, Richard. Would you have done that to Daddy?\" Richard shook his head, puzzled. \"No, of course not.\" Henry almost never called him by his full name. \"And why not?\" Henry asked, his tone stern. \"Because he's Daddy!\" Richard replied, his young voice indignant. \"And?\" \"Because it would be wrong – 'an real mean, too.\" Henry nodded. \"Now, what do you have to say for yourself, Richard?\" Richard's head dipped toward the floor, his eyes intently studying the carpet below. \"Richard...\" \"I'm sorry, Henny,\" Richard mumbled. \"I 'ill not do that again.\" Satisfied with the apology, Henry glanced over at Mark and saw that he had a hand over his mouth and an amused look about him, as if being the 'bad guy' with Richard had somehow been funny. Sick jerk , Henry thought. \"We should probably get back, Rich,\" Henry said, looking down at his little brother. Richard nodded rather slowly, took Henry's hand and let him lead the way back to the auditorium. When her number came up, Chloe rather nervously took to the stage all on her own, arranged her music on the small tablet placed in front of the piano, and began to play, just after introducing it as an entirely instrumental, piano version of ' the Star Spangled Banner '. Henry felt just a little embarrassed for not recognizing it the first time he'd heard her play it. His own nation's anthem... Anyhow, he sat there between Connie and Richard, enjoying Chloe's charmingly flawed rendition of one of America's proudest songs. One of Henry's siblings had already fallen asleep, while the other fidgeted like they had a spring or two loose. The applause from the two-hundred or so present was almost like a thundering roar when she finished, well enough to bring Connie out of her sleep and get Richard's attention, if only for a few fleeting moments. Chloe smiled and curtseyed in front of the audience before returning to her seat beside Henry. As soon as the applause died down, Henry gave his younger cousin a warm smile and a pat on the shoulder. \"You did great, Chloe.\" \"You really think so?\" she asked. Henry nodded. \"Absolutely. I loved it – so did everyone else. You're a hit!\" \"Everyone except Mark, that is,\" she whispered. Henry merely nodded in agreement. Ten minutes later came Alan's trumpet solo. \"I know I'm no Louis Armstrong,\" he said, trying to lighten the mood a bit, and eliciting a few chuckles from the audience, \"but I'm fairly certain that you won't be disappointed.\" And for the second time that night, Henry truly enjoyed what was being played. Alan was doing something that Henry could never hope to do without taking a gasp of air every ten seconds. That alone earned him Henry's praise. Finally, the entire school band came forth for the last performance about twenty after ten. As the conductor turned to face the audience, Henry could see that it was none other than Janice herself, holding a small baton in one of her hands. \"I appreciate everyone's support – and patience – this evening. But, since I know that a lot of you are probably wanting to get home at this late hour, our finale tonight will only be an excerpt, from Vivaldi's ' Gloria '.\" With that, Janice turned to the band, raised her baton, and they began to play. Later that night, with the music from earlier echoing in his head, Henry lay wide awake in his bunk, contemplating, for a time, the events of the past few hours. Mark, he had half-expected to do something strange. But Richard? What his little brother had done wasn't like him. Had he overheard them talking, and maybe misinterpreted something? That had to be it. But what could he say? For now, he left the next move to fate. But fate had absolutely nothing to do with what Mark had planned. Under the pretense of 'saying goodnight', he went straight into Richard's room and closed the door behind him. \"Mark?\" Richard asked, staring up at him. \"You want something?\" \"I just want to talk, Richard. Is that okay? I hope I didn't scare you earlier.\" \"To be hon-est you and Henny both scared me a bit.\" Mark nodded, giving Richard a look of understanding. \"That's understandable. Sorry about that.\" \"I forgive you,\" Richard replied, giving Mark an emphatic nod. \"So...\" \"So, I figured on telling you a little story. Give ya a bit of advice in the process.\" Richard nodded yet again. \"OK! I love a good story!\" Mark shrugged, but decided to proceed anyway. \"One time when I was younger – about your age, in fact – my dad went off on one of his faraway trips to some country halfway around the world. He promised me that he would be back soon, and my mom told me the same when I asked again.\" \"And?\" \"But, he didn't come back for a very, very long time – over two weeks. Do you know how long that is, Richard?\" Mark asked. Richard shrugged and shook his head. \"A very long time?\" he ventured. Mark nodded. \"Yes. A very, very long time for any four year-old to endure. It's not as bad when you've twelve, but I still remember what it was like to be your age.\" Gullible and/or naïve , Mark thought to himself. Too stupid to know how the world works. It's a cruel place to live in, kid . \"Parents and authority figures lie, Richard,\" Mark said. \"What's an 'authority figure'?\" Richard asked. \"Someone who isn't a parent, but they're just like one sometimes. Just like Henry is with you. You said he scared you earlier, didn't you?\" Richard nodded, his eyes briefly darting in the direction of the door. \"Henry lied to you Richard. You're never going home.\" \"Wh-what?\" Richard asked, his voice already trembling in fright. \"It's true, I'm afraid,\" Mark said, his face somber. \"Why else do you think Henry's been avoiding you lately?\" \"Henny would never do that!\" Richard protested. \"Daddy will come back! He will!\" \"I'm sorry, Richard. He left you, and now, Henry's doing the same thing to spend more time with me. I told him that he should spend more time with you and Connie, but he just wouldn't listen.\" \"I know him! I know Henny!\" \"You thought you knew him,\" Mark corrected. \"Henry's not the brother you've believed him to be, Richard. There's something wrong with him.\" Henry lay in his bunk in the now-darkened bedroom, just listening for when Mark came back, and pretended to be asleep when he finally did. What did he do now? Henry wondered. He had a feeling that he'd find out soon enough. The room was dark, and he could just make out Mark's silhouette. Henry watched the boy closely. Would he do anything? Try to hurt him in some way? Without a word, Mark changed into his pajamas and got into bed. But that didn't mean he'd stay there. What if Mark waited until the middle of the night, when he was certain Henry was asleep? What if he tried to do something then? Henry wondered how he'd get any sleep that night. He stared up at the darkened ceiling, thin shafts of pale moonlight from outside peeking through the curtains. He just didn't get it. He didn't understand how the kid could be that way. Mark had a perfectly healthy mother, and a father who was around a fair amount of the time. He should appreciate that, not throw it away. He should be a happy kid, not this cruel, insensitive person who delighted in causing others pain and misery. Yes, that was thing that troubled Henry the most. What he and Alan had talked about yesterday. Why? Why was Mark like this? A/N: How'd you all like the second Chloe and first Richard POV? This is where things start to get interesting. And how about Mark's twisted plan? Can you guess what he's trying to do? Keep your eyes peeled for the next chapter, ' Worries '.[Chapter 15] Chapter 15 - Worries December 17 Bright sunlight was streaming through the partly-open curtains when Henry awoke the next morning. Immediately, he leaned out over the edge and glanced down at Mark's bunk. It was empty and unmade, and a slight shiver ran through Henry. He'd stayed up for a long time last night, but obviously he'd finally fallen asleep. Just the thought of himself asleep and totally defenseless, in the same room as Mark, his greatest enemy, greatly unnerved him. Henry jumped down from the bunk and went over to the window, having to squint his eyes at the intensity of the blinding sunlight. Outside, it was a clear, bright day, with the sun reflecting off of the surprisingly calm, blue water. Henry pulled open the window and was greeted by a cool, gentle, and fairly pleasant breeze. An improvement over even yesterday's mild weather. Right now, Henry wanted nothing more than to go swimming in the Pacific and bask in the warm sunlight. But then the memories of last night came back in a rush. He remembered what he'd told Mark not to do last night. And just like kids their age, telling him not to do something would only make him want to do it all the more. No, he simply couldn't play today. There was something else he had to do. And he had to discover what Mark had done just before bed last night. He just hoped that he wasn't too late. Henry dressed quickly and hurried downstairs. He could somehow sense that Mark was not only out of his room, but out of the house as well. It was weird how everything felt different when Mark wasn't there, as if his presence somehow darkened the atmosphere and made it more oppressive. When Mark wasn't there, the house felt warmer and more inviting. Or maybe it was just his imagination. Henry went straight into the kitchen. Janice was standing by the sink, doing the dishes. It looked as though breakfast was already finished. \"Where's everyone else?\" Henry asked. Janice turned from the sink. \"Well, Chloe was here just a moment ago with Connie. Why do you ask?\" \"They didn't go out, did they?\" \"No, I don't think so. Is something wrong?\" \"Uh...\" Henry now realized that he should have been a bit more subtle. \"No, no. I was just wondering,\" he said with a yawn. Janice frowned slightly. \"You look tired. Did you get enough sleep last night?\" Henry shrugged indifferently. \"Hungry?\" Janice asked. Henry nodded and glanced around. \"Have you seen Mark?\" \"He went out about an hour ago,\" Janice said. \"Off on another one of his 'secret missions'. So, what would you like for breakfast?\" \"Oh, anything you've got,\" Henry replied, his voice distant. He walked out to the living room and looked around, hoping that he'd see Chloe or one of his own siblings there. For the moment, the room was quiet and empty of life. \"Looking for something?\" Janice called out. \"Eh, not really,\" Henry said with a shrug as he came back into the kitchen. In any case, if Chloe, Connie, or Richard were still anywhere in the house, he would hear them leaving. \"How do scrambled eggs and bacon sound?\" Janice asked. \"A-OK,\" Henry replied. He sat down at the table, but simply could not relax. He was too on-edge. Then Henry had a thought. What if the kids had already gone outside? And what if Mark was out there, waiting for them? If any other kid in the world had implied that they were going to do something bad to their younger sibling, or someone else's, Henry would have just ignored it. Why? Because any other kid would have simply been joking. But he wasn't dealing with just 'any other kid' here. This was Mark. And if he implied something, that meant he was going to do it, no matter the consequences. Just then, Chloe came running into the kitchen, wearing jeans and a purple windbreaker, her hair tied back in a ponytail just like her mother's. Connie followed closely and was similarly attired. \"Hey girls! Where are you off to?\" Janice asked. \"Mrs. Parson invited me and Connie to help her bake cookies today,\" Chloe replied, her face bright and eager. Janice smiled at this. \"That was very nice of her, wasn't it?\" \"Can we go now, Mom?\" Chloe asked. \"Of course,\" Janice said, laughing. \"I sure don't want to spoil your fun.\" \"Great! Thanks, Mom!\" \"Thanks, Aunt Janice,\" Connie said, grinning. The girls then turned to leave. At that moment, Henry realized something. Richard wasn't with them. He quickly turned to Janice. \"Where's Richard at?\" \"Richard? He went out with Mark earlier. Said that they were going into town.\" Richard? Alone with Mark? That was a disaster waiting to happen. \"Wait!\" he called out. His sister and Chloe both stopped almost halfway down the hall. \"What is it, Henry?\" Chloe asked. \"How'd you feel if I came with you into town?\" he asked. Chloe turned to Connie for a second, then shrugged and nodded her head. \"Sure.\" \"Great!\" \"We'll stop at the overlook by the beach,\" Chloe said. \"You can meet us there.\" \"No,\" Henry said hastily. Connie raised an eyebrow and Chloe scowled. \"What is it, Henry?\" Janice asked over the sizzling of raw eggs hitting a hot skillet. \"Well, I was just wondering if they would wait for me, that's all,\" Henry said. \"Why can't they go ahead?\" Janice asked. Henry had to think fast. \"Well, uh... I don't know how to get to the overlook.\" \"It's easy,\" Chloe said. \"You just go down the driveway, make a right, and follow the road until you come to a little parking lot near the beach.\" \"Well, I'd still like to walk there with you,\" Henry said. \"I mean, I won't be too long. All I have to do is eat breakfast and throw on my shoes and a jacket.\" Janice gave him a funny look, and then called out to the girls. \"Would you wait?\" she asked. \"But we're getting too warm in these jackets,\" Chloe replied. \"Maybe you could play outside until Henry is ready,\" her mother suggested. \"Okay.\" Chloe and Connie both smiled warmly at Henry. \"We'll see you outside.\" \"Great.\" Henry waved at them and then glanced back at Janice, hoping that the whole scene hadn't appeared too strange. Janice looked back at him. She cocked her head slightly to the side, puzzled. \"What is it, Henry? Is something wrong?\" she asked. \"Not really, no. I just feel like I spend a lot of time with Mark, and the girls get ignored too much. I thought they'd like it if I spent some time with them, too.\" Janice smiled. \"That's very sweet of you, Henry. You're a good brother.\" After a quick breakfast, Henry put on his shoes and borrowed jacket and headed outside to join the girls. Chloe had engaged Connie in a surprisingly heated soccer match, but they both immediately stopped once they noticed Henry. \"You ready?\" Chloe asked, tossing the soccer ball aside. Henry nodded. \"Sure.\" They then started down the driveway and eventually out into the side of the road. As they walked, Henry reveled in the cool, salty breeze and watched the blue waves of the Pacific lazily curl upward and crash against the base of the cliffs to their right. This was one of those moments where he could almost forget about the current situation. Almost. They continued down the road, eventually passing the old lighthouse and the mission-style homes that Henry had first noticed on the way in nearly a week ago. Wow... They'd been here that long already? Well, time flies when you're busy, I suppose ... It had started out as fun, but after the first few days, everything had gone downhill in a big hurry. First there was Captain Lawson's dog. Then crashing the drone on the bridge and causing the big pileup. Henry still hadn't quite figured out what exactly had caused the explosion. Something to do with that jar, maybe? And now there was Mark's threat against the girls. Everything was moving so fast that Henry wasn't entirely certain that he was capable of making the correct move, or if said move would have a desirable outcome. But when things hit the fan, he would have to make a split-second decision, and simply hope that it was the right one. Right now, he was simply waiting for Mark's next move, whatever that might be. And with him around Richard, that could be just about anything. Finally, Henry sighted Parson's Bakery ahead, as did his sister and Chloe, at which point they began to run as fast as their legs would carry them. Henry had to seriously work out to catch up. By the time they stopped, he was winded. \"Try to keep up next time, old man,\" Chloe teased. \"Hey! Don't you go calling him old!\" Connie scolded. Henry had to smile a little at that. At least Connie was still loyal to him. That was something. For the rest of the morning, Henry watched in mild amusement as the girls helped Joann Parsons bake several batches of cookies. He even got to try a few of each kind. Chocolate chip and peanut butter were his favorites. After a time, Henry excused himself to go outside for some fresh air. He sat at one of the tables on the small patio out front and watched townspeople go by on their daily business. Henry yawned deeply and rubbed at his eyes. Even now, he was tired, and dearly wished that he could take a nap – but he had to keep an eye out in case Mark and Richard walked by. And after last night, he knew that Mark made no idle threats. Henry was not about to let his sister and Chloe out of his immediate peripherals, either. And he was certainly not going to let them leave if Mark was on the loose. He was so focused on his thoughts that he failed to notice Maggie Goldblum until she was standing on the opposite side of the table. \"Hello there, Henry.\" Henry looked up, mildly startled. He suddenly remembered that at his first appointment he had agreed to another meeting with her. \"When you didn't show up, I called Janice and she told me you'd be here,\" Maggie said. \"I guess you forgot about our appointment.\" Henry looked away and stared out into the street. He couldn't believe that she had actually come and found him. What was she going to do now? Try to have a session out here in the open, in plain view of all these people? \" Did you forget, Henry?\" Maggie asked, her voice gentle. Henry shrugged. In a way, he kind of had forgotten. But there were reasons why he'd forgotten. One was that it was much more important that he protect his sister and Chloe, and do the best that he could for Richard. And there was another reason. \"Maybe I just didn't feel like talking,\" Henry replied. \"May I join you?\" Maggie asked politely. Henry gave her a surprised look. He didn't want her to join him, but he knew it would be rude to say no. So he gave her a slight nod of assent. Even after she sat down, Henry remained silent and he continued to stare off into empty space, his mind wandering. Some time later, though it was probably only a few minutes, Maggie finally broke the silence. \"So, I guess that you don't want to speak today,\" she said. Henry gave her a nearly imperceptible nod. \"Not a single word?\" Maggie asked. \"Talking helps, Henry.\" The boy stared at the ground, drew in a deep breath, and finally looked Maggie in the eyes. \"What do you think... what makes a person evil?\" he asked. Maggie's face grew pensive. \"Evil?\" Henry nodded. \"It's a word I don't have much time for, Henry,\" she replied. \"It's what people say when they've given up trying to understand someone. There's a reason for everything, if we can just find it. And that includes people's behavior. Unfortunately, the reason can sometimes be rather difficult to find. Why do you ask?\" Henry merely looked away and seemed to ignore her question. \"Do you think that you're evil, Henry?\" The boy remained silent, his wayward gaze unmoving. \"Is it because you think that you let your mother die? You know that's not true, Henry. We've talked about it, and we both know that it didn't happen that way. You know that, don't you?\" Henry finally met her gaze. He nodded. \"Yes.\" Maggie gave him a smile. \"Good. Then we're making some progress here.\" \"Can I pose a hypothetical question, Miss Goldblum?\" Henry asked. \"Sure you can, Henry. And please, it's Maggie, remember?\" Okay, then... \"Let's suppose that there was this kid – a boy...\" \"A boy about your age?\" Maggie guessed. Henry nodded. \"Suppose he did, or had done, these terrible things... The kind of things that could get people killed. And the only reason he did them was because he liked doing them. What kind of person could that boy be?\" Maggie pensively gazed off into the pale blue, cloudless sky for a few moments. \"I haven't known many people like that, Henry. Most I've never seen again.\" \"You said 'most.' And the others?\" Henry asked. \"Any others...\" Maggie's face grew tense and she trailed off. Henry could see this. \"Sorry if I said anything wrong, I –\" Maggie shook her head. \"No, no. You're perfectly fine, Henry. I suppose that I dwell on the past a little too much at times.\" Henry reached into his pocket for his phone, but it wasn't there. Must've left it back at the house. In Mark's room. Just great... He looked down at his watch. It was now just after 12 p.m. He then stood from his chair and headed for the bakery's front doors. \"Henry.\" He stopped and turned to Maggie. \"What?\" he asked. \"You don't know anyone like that, do you?\" she asked in return. She was dead serious. For a split second, he contemplated telling her, but quickly decided against it. It was best that he keep that part to himself for now. \"No.\" Henry kept his voice calm and flat out lied to her. Lying had become an unfortunately necessary 'evil' in the growing fight against Mark. Seconds later, as if on cue, Connie and Chloe burst through the front doors with their jackets tied around their waists and their shirts dusted in flour. Their faces were also fairly dirty, but they both looked as happy as Henry had ever seen them. Once again, Henry had to smile. Maggie turned from her seat at the table and waved to them. \"Hello there, girls,\" she said, chuckling a little. \"Hello, Miss Goldblum,\" Connie and Chloe chorused. Henry looked over to the girls. \"Good timing. I was just about to come back in and get you two. We should get going. Your mom's going to be expecting us back soon, Chloe.\" Chloe nodded and fell into step along with Connie and Henry. Just before crossing the street, Henry glanced one more time at Maggie, out of the corner of his eye. She was still sitting at the table, looking back at him with a concerned look etched into her face. Henry just as quickly turned away, took the girls' hands in his own, and led them across the street and back toward home. Maggie kept her eyes on them until they left her field of view completely. She thought carefully about what Henry had said to her. She had also gotten the distinct impression that he knew far more than he was saying. And far more than he was willing to tell. Henry's phone was ringing. Mark stopped in the upstairs hallway, just outside his room and glanced around, making certain he was alone. Then he went in and picked it up off the nightstand. \"Hello?\" For a split second all that Mark heard was loud, but distant noises in the background. Then a voice said, \"Hello? Henry?\" \"It's Mark.\" He was surprised the caller couldn't tell the difference in their voices. He either had to be calling from far away or it was someone who didn't know them very well. \"This is Wallace. I'm calling from Hong Kong.\" \"Oh... Hi, Uncle Wallace.\" Mark glanced out the door to again make sure he was alone. \"How is everyone?\" Wallace asked. \"Fine, Uncle Wallace. Just fine. How are you?\" \"Tired, but otherwise all right. I've been running like mad since I got here. But I wanted to call and say hello. Speaking of which, where's Henry?\" Mark opened a window and stuck his head outside. He could see Henry trudging up the drive, with Connie and Chloe in tow. \"Henry's not here right now.\" \"Oh, darn. What about Connie or Richard?\" \"Nope – they went out with him for a hike earlier,\" Mark said. \"They haven't come back yet.\" Outside, Henry and the girls were approaching the front walk. Mark had been wondering where they had been, and if they were together. Aw, how cute , Mark thought mockingly. \"Oh, well,\" Wallace said with a sigh. \"So, how are things going? You kids having any fun?\" \"We sure are. Lots of fun,\" Mark replied. Well, he certainly was. \"Glad to hear it,\" Wallace said. \"So, do you think that Henry and his sibs like it there?\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Mark said, watching Henry, Connie, and Chloe start up the walk toward the front porch, and finally disappearing from his view. \"I think they all really like it here. And we really like them, too.\" Well, that was at least a half-truth . That ought to be good enough. \"I'm glad. Well, do me a great big favor and tell your cousins that I called, okay?\" Wallace said. \"And give my best to your folks.\" \"Sure thing, Uncle Wallace,\" Mark said. He had no intention of doing anything of the sort. Why should such responsibilities fall to him, anyway? \"Bye, now, Uncle Wallace.\" \"Goodbye, Mark.\" Just as Mark hung up and set the phone back down, he heard the front door open, and the sound of Henry and the girls' voices in the entryway. He walked out of his room and stood at the top of the stairs, with his hands resting on the banister. Henry was just about to shut the front door when he saw Mark staring down at them from the upstairs landing and he froze with his hand on the doorknob. They locked eyes and stared at each other. Henry waited for Mark to say something, anything, but the latter remained completely silent. Shaking off the sudden creeping feeling at the back of his neck, Henry finally closed the door and locked it. Then he took the girls' jackets to hang on the coat rack while they went and washed up for lunch. When Henry looked up the stairs again, Mark had disappeared. A/N: Keep the reviews coming! Your feedback is appreciated. And if you've stuck with me for this long, hopefully you'll stick with me for a while longer. In this chapter, tensions have been simmering for awhile and thoughts have been brooding. The next chapter, ' Escalation ', will change all of that and throw the story into a higher gear. Side Note: Funny thing happened. When I went to go see the new X-Men movie, Days of Future Past , just over a week ago, I stayed for the post-credits scene. But in the credits themselves, I caught a rather familiar name to readers of this story and of TGS stories in general: Mark Evans. I know, 'Evans' is a relatively common last name, and 'Mark' is even more of a common first name. It was just interesting to see that full name in particular.[Chapter 16] Chapter 16 - Escalation Henry didn't see Mark again until lunch. Jack and Janice joined the kids and they ate in the dining room at the big, rectangular table. Henry sat across the table and as far away from Mark as possible. He didn't want to have anything to do with him, but he also didn't want to draw too much attention to their situation, either. Every time he looked over at Richard, who had now chosen to sit beside Mark, there was intense anger and hatred in the four year-old's eyes. What had Mark done to him? Henry now knew that Mark wasn't one to play fair. But making him look bad in front of Richard, his own brother, and then completely undermining their relationship as brothers was taking things a step too far. By every appearance, in less than twenty-four hours, Richard had lost all faith in his older brother. To Richard, whatever lies Mark had fed him probably seemed like the truth, and no matter what, he was still just a four year-old – and four year-olds were rather gullible. That is, they tended to believe quite a bit of what people told them or of what they heard, whether or not it was actually true. Henry was deeply hurt by this turn of events, and knew that he would have to act soon, or Richard would be even further onto Mark's side, and God only knew what would happen then... No matter what, this isn't going to end well , Henry thought rather grimly. \"So, what's going on tonight, Dad?\" Mark asked as they ate spaghetti with herb sauce and garlic bread made on Texas toast. \"There's that fundraising dinner at Italia's. And I'm the first speaker, too. So, since both your mom and I will be gone, it shouldn't be too much to ask for you characters to babysit yourselves, will it?\" \"Sure thing, Dad,\" Mark replied with his trademark smile. \"We'll try not to make too much trouble,\" Chloe added. \"Oh, boy!\" Connie said. \"It'll be fun!\" Fun? Henry thought. Sure, maybe for Mark ... Simultaneously, he felt a sickness rise in the pit of his stomach, but kept on eating nonetheless. The very idea of being alone in the house with Mark and their younger siblings deeply unnerved Henry. Who knew what Mark might try to pull when his parents weren't around? \"Can me and Connie stay up late and watch a movie?\" Chloe asked eagerly. \" Muppet Christmas Carol is on at 9:30.\" \"No,\" Mark replied, his voice flat. \"And why not?\" Chloe challenged. \"Because it might warp your impressionable little brain,\" Mark said dryly. If that thought hadn't been so scary, it might have actually been funny, Henry thought to himself. Imagine Mark warning his sister that a movie might hurt her, when she's living with a monster in disguise, one that could do her more harm than anything she might see on a TV . \"I don't have to listen to you,\" Chloe told her brother defiantly. \"You're not the boss here. Mom and Dad are.\" Mark narrowed his eyes and glared at his sister. \"Oh, really? I am too the boss.\" \"Yeah,\" Chloe said, \"When they're not here... and when Laura can't come over to babysit. You're third on the food chain, pal.\" A low, angry growl issued from Mark's throat. \"Little scum eater...\" he muttered under his breath. Janice's eyes widened. \"Mark Jordan Evans! We don't talk that way in this house, young man!\" she said sternly. \"What's a scum eater?\" Chloe asked, genuinely confused. \"Never mind, Chloe,\" Jack said. \"It's something your brother should not have said.\" \"And, it's something he'll never say again,\" Janice added, staring her son right in the eyes. Mark blinked, and Henry watched as once again, he transformed himself into a friendly, smiling son. \"I'm sorry. That was wrong of me. Forgive me, 'Chlo?\" \"No,\" Chloe replied. \"Chloe!\" Janice said. \"He apologized, and now you need to forgive him.\" Henry certainly wouldn't have blamed her for not doing so. \"C'mon,\" Mark said in a seemingly lighthearted tone. \"Forgive and forget.\" Chloe mumbled something under her breath. \"What was that, Chloe?\" her father asked. \"I forgive you,\" Chloe grumbled in Mark's general direction. That was as good as it was going to get. \"Oh, hey, Dad, Mom,\" Mark said, \"guess what? Henry's been saying he'd kind of like to move into Matthew's room.\" Henry's jaw dropped so far, he could have sworn he heard it hit the table. He'd never said anything like that! \"You know, that's not a bad idea,\" Jack said. Henry watched Janice start at the very suggestion. He knew that Mark using Matthew's room would be a big source of disagreement between Jack and Janice. \"Darling,\" Janice said to Jack, \"we've been over this before.\" \"Henry seems to like it in there,\" Mark put in, as if to add more fuel to the fire. \"That's not true,\" Henry protested. \"I don't want to move into that room. I never said that I wanted to.\" \"You don't have to lie, Henry,\" Mark said with a wink. He's one to talk! Henry's mouth opened again, but no words came out. He was flabbergasted by this latest scheme of Mark's. Meanwhile, Jack and Janice were engaged in a heated discussion that bordered on becoming a full-blown argument. Henry knew that this was exactly what Mark had wanted. \"Honey, I really think you should give the idea some thought,\" Jack was saying to his wife. \"We can't keep the room like that forever. It's turning into a museum. It's not good for the kids.\" Henry could see that Janice was barely in control of her emotions. Clenching a napkin tightly in her hand, she leaned across the table toward her husband. \"I never said it would be forever,\" she insisted. \"I'll change the room when I'm ready.\" She turned to Henry, who felt terrible for having any part in making his aunt feel so bad, despite the fact that it was all just another one of Mark's sick deceptions. \"There's a nice room just down the hall that you can use, Henry,\" she said. \"I never said anything about wanting to stay in Matthew's room. Mark's making it up.\" But it was if his aunt and uncle were deaf to his last few words. \"Listen to me, hon,\" Jack said. \"If Henry, or, maybe Richard, moved in there, it would help. The room needs to be lived in. I'm not saying you should throw the toys or any of the other stuff away.\" Henry could see that Janice was now on the verge of tears. She'd said everything she had to say on the matter. \"I really don't want to discuss this right now,\" she said. But Jack simply wouldn't let it go. \"I know you don't want to discuss it. But we've got to face it. We can't keep running away.\" Janice abruptly stood from the table, nearly tipping her chair over in the process. She was trembling and doing everything within her power to choke back her tears. \"I am facing it, Jack!\" she cried angrily. \"Every day. Every day ! You're the one who's forgetting!\" Mark lowered his face into his hands, as if he were somehow saddened by the argument he had caused. He obviously wasn't, since Henry now saw that he was smirking. As if deliberately starting a painful argument between his own parents was somehow funny... At that moment, now more than ever, Henry wanted to jump up from his chair and point a finger at the wretched kid. It's him! He wanted to shout aloud. It's Mark! He's the one who started all of this! But once again, Henry couldn't bring himself say it. They'd never believe him. Mark was their son, and he wasn't. Simple as that. Janice was now leaving the room at an ever-quickening pace. \"Janice! Please don't walk away from this, hon,\" Jack said, his voice desperate. But Janice had left the room altogether, and they could hear her footsteps hurrying up the stairs. It was pretty obvious that she wasn't coming back. At least not anytime soon. \"Oh, God...\" Jack muttered, sighing. Yet again, Mark had won. Henry was starting to lose count. Janice stood at the door to Matthew's room and took in a sharp, shaky breath. She hadn't been in here since... After trying to collect herself, Janice went into the room. As she looked around, a tear rolled down her cheek, and then another. Everything in here was all that remained of her baby boy. What did I do wrong? Janice asked herself. I was a good mother... Why did he have to die?! She sat on the floor beside Matthew's bed. At heart, Janice knew that she couldn't have done anything, but it still tore her up inside just knowing that. Jack probably did, too. And she couldn't fault her husband. It was sad, but she'd realized long ago that Jack would never understand the way she felt. It hurt to think that he didn't feel the same way, but they were two different people, and everyone had a different way of dealing with grief. Janice realized that. She was certain that he felt the pain of Matthew's loss as much as she did. Upon looking out of the corner of her eye, Janice was startled to see Mark standing in the doorway. She could tell that he wasn't aware that she was looking at him. On his face was the oddest smile. It was almost contemptuous. Almost a smirk. Janice spun around. Mark looked surprised for a moment. Now the look on his face was replaced by one of deep sympathy. Janice could only assume that she had been mistaken about the earlier look on her son's face. Mark stepped toward her and put a hand on her shoulder. \"Hey there... Don't cry, Mom,\" he said softly. He's such a dear boy , Janice thought. So sweet and thoughtful . At times almost more than her own husband. Almost too good to be true , she sometimes said to herself. But this time was one when she was glad it was true. She took his hand and pressed it against her damp cheek. \"Thank you, Mark,\" she whispered. \"Thank you for understanding.\" He hugged his mother tight, head resting on her shoulder like a loyal dog. What Janice thankfully couldn't see was the amused look on his face. As the afternoon passed, hour by hour, Henry felt a growing sense of dread over the approaching evening. He spent most of the time playing with, or at least, keeping an eye on the girls and Richard. Mark came and went, but the boys never said anything to each other. As the sun began to sink below the western horizon, the kids all ate a hastily prepared dinner in the kitchen. Connie and Chloe eagerly chatted about their day with Mrs. Parson, while Henry and Richard were both quiet, though for rather different reasons. Mark shot Henry a few taunting smiles, as if to say, Just you wait until tonight, when my parents leave ... After dinner, Henry sat on a pillow in the upstairs hall, pretending to read something on his computer. A few yards away, the girls played with Chloe's dolls, while further down the hall, Richard sat in a corner and pouted (though what about Henry had yet to discern). Henry suddenly heard the sound of leather dress shoes on the wooden floor of the entryway. Moments later, he heard the sharper click of high heels. It sounded as though they were coming from the kitchen. \"Come on, now, Janice,\" Jack said hastily. \"We're going to be late.\" \"I'm sorry,\" Janice replied. At that moment, Henry realized that they were about to leave. He jumped up and raced down the stairs in an effort to intercept Janice before she and Jack left. \"Janice?\" \"Not now, Henry,\" Jack said in a mildly irritated voice. \"Don't worry, Henry,\" Janice replied. \"I've left the light on in the kitchen in case any of you get hungry. There are plenty of snacks to go around.\" Henry remained silent and rooted to the spot on the downstairs landing, unable to properly articulate what he wanted to say. \"Is there something else you wanted to say?\" Janice asked. \"Sort of,\" Henry replied. Jack sighed. \"Janice!\" Catching on her husband's obviously growing irritation, Janice looked up at Henry. \"Can it wait until morning?\" she asked. \"Well... it's just...\" Then he stopped speaking. Explaining this would take far too much time. So he simply nodded in reply to Janice's question. It'll have to wait . Don't really have a choice, unfortunately . \"We'll talk tomorrow, Henry,\" Janice said. \"Now you and Mark are in charge, OK? The number of our restaurant is right by the phone just in case you need anything. Lights out for the girls and Richard by nine-thirty at the latest – I'm sure you and Mark know what to do.\" I know I do. It's Mark that I'm worried about ... Jack quickly herded Janice through the front door and exchanged a grimace with Henry. Then he slammed it shut and locked it from the outside. The pounding of eager footsteps from above quickly drew Henry's attention, and he was surprised to see Richard coming down the stairs, looking like his energetic old self. Henry looked up at his little brother. For now, the angry fire was gone from his young eyes. \"Henny! Henny!\" Richard cried out, flying past him. \"Guess what? We are gonna play hide 'n seek!\" he said, bubbling with childish excitement. Hide and seek? In an instant, Henry imagined a whole myriad of ways such a game could go wrong with Mark supervising. It was a disaster in the making, and he knew it. Mark started down the stairs, grinning. He shrugged helplessly. \"It was his idea.\" Ha! Yeah, I'll bet ... No sooner had Mark reached the bottom landing than Henry ran after Richard, hoping to intercept the four year-old before he found a clever hiding spot. In no time at all, Henry had found his little brother, trying to sneak behind the sofa in the living room. \"Slow down there, Rich! I just wanna talk to you, buddy.\" \"What about?\" Richard snapped. There was that anger again. Out of nowhere. What did Mark do to him? Henry had just opened his mouth to respond when another voice seemed to come out of thin air. It was hollow and scratchy, filled with static. The angry fire left Richard's eyes in a hurry, replaced by fear. \"Darkness...\" the voice said. \"It is my light... and my ally...\" Henry could taste bile in his throat. He had a very bad feeling about this... And now Richard had scooted closer to him as well. The voice continued. \"And in the beginning – before light, there was darkness.\" That's Mark's voice! Seconds later, the lights went out, plunging the room, and the entire house, into darkness. A/N: I hope this chapter doesn't seem too rushed, but it is a pretty good intro for the next chapter, which comes next. Read on! Kudos for guessing where I got Mark's middle name from.[Chapter 17] Chapter 17 - Blackout Now seeming to forget his anger, a trembling Richard instinctively clung to Henry's leg in terror. Placing a comforting hand on his brother's shoulder, Henry did his best to take stock of this latest turn of events. What could have happened? Was there a power failure of some kind? He looked out one of the front windows and toward the road. No, the streetlights were on, and another house farther down the way had lights, too. Mark must have turned off the power! A series of rapid footsteps coming down the stairs quickly put Henry on alert. Then there was a sudden yelp and a loud thud as whoever it was tripped and fell. \"Stay close, Rich,\" Henry whispered. He took Richard by the hand and began tiptoeing out into the front hall. But Richard shirked back in fear. Henry gently tugged his hand. \"C'mon, Rich,\" he whispered. \"Would you rather be with me, or all alone?\" Faced with those two choices, Henry knew which one his little brother would pick. Richard decided to stay with him. With that small crisis over, they moved on to the next one. The mystery person who had tripped on the stairs was Connie. She lay sprawled on the bottom landing, clutching her ankle, and was in obvious pain, but she wasn't crying. Instead, her teeth were clamped down on her lower lip, enough to draw a tiny bit of blood, and, she was whimpering. \"Connie!\" Henry cried out in a hushed voice. He kneeled over her, while Richard clung to the bannister. \"Where does it hurt?\" he asked. She motioned almost imperceptibly at her ankle. Henry nodded. What am I supposed to do now?! With Connie now partially incapacitated, his options for hiding her and Richard from Mark had shrunk considerably. Where could they go? Where? He was on the verge of panic. And then it came to him. \"Hold on, Conse, I'm gonna get you outta here. Rich, stay close.\" In a single deft motion, Henry lifted Connie into his arms and gingerly carried her through the darkened halls, with Richard at his heels. After what seemed like an eternity, they reached Jack's study. The one place Mark isn't allowed ... Henry gently laid his sister on the floor behind Jack's desk, and brought Richard in close. He spoke in urgent, hushed tones. \"I need you two to stay right here.\" \"Wait, where you goin', Henny?\" Richard asked, his voice trembling with fright and uncertainty. \"I'm going to find out what's going on. You both have to be as still and quiet as possible. And, if Mark finds you, just shout for me as loud as you can. OK?\" Connie grimaced in the dark, but Henry still caught her nod of assent. Richard was slower to respond, but he agreed nonetheless. With that, Henry left the room and quietly closed the door behind him. \"Chloe!\" he called out into the darkness. \"I'm ready!\" a voice replied. \"Come and get me!\" It sounded as if Chloe was somewhere upstairs, but exactly where, Henry couldn't easily discern. The only thing he knew for certain was that he had to find his younger cousin before Mark did. Henry quickly moved over to the foot of the stairs, and was startled at the sight of a dark figure standing at the top. In a split second, the figure abruptly vanished, an eerie laugh trailing in its' wake. Mark ... Disturbed, but still not deterred, Henry raced up the stairs, and looked down the hallway in either direction. The hall itself was empty, but it was a bit lighter here, and that light cast shadows that seemed to waver every few seconds. Henry was starting to hate the shadows in this house. Then he noticed that a door at the far end of the hall was slightly ajar. He cautiously moved toward it and pushed it open. \"Chloe...\" he whispered. \"Chloe?\" Little to no light illuminated this room, rendering it pitch black. Henry could just barely make out a set of heavy curtains that covered the window. Were they moving ever so slightly? He couldn't tell, but Chloe could very easily be hiding behind them. Henry rushed in and swept the curtains aside with his hands, but no one was there. Then he caught the reflection of something in the window. It was the glint of a pair of black eyes, staring straight at him! He spun around in a flash of panic, ready to defend himself if need be, but then he realized just what those eyes belonged to: A life-sized teddy bear, slumped over in the corner of the room. Henry breathed a huge sigh of relief and strode back into the hall. Just as he did, a slight creaking noise sounded from nearby. Cocking his ear, he listened for the noise again, trying to pinpoint, or, at least generalize, its' source. There it was again. It was coming from the side hall: the one that led to Chloe's room! Henry quickly rounded the corner, but the split second he did, a bright light suddenly burst on, blinding him. Italia's was one of the finest restaurants that Castel had to offer, if not the finest. The menu very much reminded Janice of some of the big-city Italian places, but the food was easily half the price, and tasted just as good. Not only that, but it had plenty of space to offer as well, which made it the perfect venue for their fundraising dinner. At the moment, Janice and Jack were seated at a large table near the center of the main room, along with Joan Michaels and Chuck and Linnie Parks. The air was abuzz with a dozen conversations as Jack got to his feet, a microphone in-hand. He cleared his throat, and most talking ceased. \"Thank you for being here, and I hope you're having a good time. Tonight, we're all going to hear the voices of sweet reason. You're going to hear an eminent botanist tell us what we stand to lose. And, we'll also be hearing from the head of the marine ecology group at UC Berkeley...\" Janice had tried her best not to let it show, but that strange conversation with Henry was beginning to nag at her. And for some reason, it was making her rather nervous as well. What was it? Maybe it was the way that Henry had talked. He did seem a bit on-edge about her and Jack leaving. But he had said that whatever it was, it could wait until morning, right? She quickly downed half a glass of white wine, in an effort to try and calm her nerves, but it did no good. Deep down, she was worried about leaving the kids alone for the night. It was a strange feeling, but she somehow knew that something wasn't quite right. But there was nothing she could do about it. Or was there? Trying to be as discrete as possible without attracting too much attention, Janice retrieved her cellphone from her purse and began slowly edging out of her chair. Out of the corner of his eye, Jack caught her leaving, and registered this with a feeling of disapproval, but he continued nonetheless. \"You'll hear from specialists in pollution control, environmental services, traffic planning, and federal law. And while you're listening to this expert testimony, generously given to us free of charge, I'd like you to reflect on what you might be hearing from the other side. Only one sound – the sound of money. Self-interested, greedy money...\" His words quickly faded into the background as Janice strode through the front doors and onto the empty patio outside, her phone already in-hand and dialing the number for home. The ringing of the extension phone in Jack and Janice's room barely registered in the back of Henry's mind as he threw his hands up to shield his face from the sudden, blinding light in front of him. \" Ahhh! \" Henry gasped in surprise and stumbled backward, just barely keeping his balance in the process. As his vision cleared, he saw that the source of the light was actually on the floor, and pointed upward. Right into Mark's creepy, deadpan face. The kid just stood there, ramrod straight and totally still, holding his katana in a two-fisted grip, the blade facing outward. For a second, Henry had to wonder whether or not Mark had somehow turned into a statue. \"Mark...?\" Henry asked, his voice quavering ever so slightly. His cousin refused to respond, or even so much as bat an eye. It was eerie. He'd certainly do well at an interview for Buckingham Palace guards ... And then, in the space of a split second, Mark had leveled the sword at Henry and pointed it straight at his throat. The light at their feet glinted off the silver blade, giving Henry an unpleasant reminder of the thing's lethal beauty. His mind racing, Henry stumbled backward and quickly found himself trapped as Mark advanced, face still deadpan and strangely emotionless. In a flash, Mark had him pinned to the wall with one arm, while the other held the edge of the katana against Henry's throat. Was this how it was all going to end? Henry had typically imagined himself dying of old age. He gulped and then winced ever so slightly as the cold blade traced its' way across his neck. \"L – Look, Mark,\" Henry stuttered nervously. \"It – it doesn't h-have to go down this way...\" This time, Mark finally responded. \"And who says so?\" With that, he inverted the blade and pricked Henry's throat with the tip of it. Henry flinched and his hand instinctively flew up to his neck. It came away with a tiny smear of blood across his fingertips. He looked up at Mark, stunned. \"Here's a bit of a riddle for you, Henry,\" Mark said, as if completely oblivious to what he had just done. \"An obedient boy is a good son, while the perfect boy is the better son. So, answer me this – now, mind you it doesn't have to be right away, either, give it a while to simmer in that ol' brainpan of yours – which one of us is the better son?\" Henry simply stared at him, dumbfounded. In the blink of an eye, Mark flashed the light in his face, briefly blinding him. When Henry opened his eyes, he found himself once again standing in the darkness, with Mark nowhere to be seen. For another few moments, Henry couldn't see as his eyes fully adjusted. But he still heard footsteps as Mark raced ahead. He started to race after him, and then stopped abruptly. What if it was a trap? Henry decided to proceed slowly. He inched his way forward in the dark, listening carefully for any sound that might give him a clue as to what lay ahead. \" Ahhhh! \" A sudden, piercing scream sent a shiver through Henry. He froze in terrified confusion. It sounded like Chloe, and it seemed to have come from that floor, too. But where? \"Chloe!\" Henry shouted desperately. \"Where are you?!\" \" Ahhhh! Stop it, Mark! \" This second scream raised the hairs on Henry's neck. Mark had gotten to her first! What was he doing to her? \"Chloe!\" Henry called out again, the anxiety audibly rising in his voice. He bolted toward the noise and forced his way through another partly open door. Here, the flashlight lay abandoned on the floor. Henry snatched it up and aimed it in the direction of the scuffle. Over by an old wardrobe, Mark had his sister pinned to the floor, and was tickling her mercilessly. Henry let out a sigh of relief. Chloe was all right. They noticed Henry and both got up. Chloe had a big, goofy smile on her face. Mark was also smiling, but his was one of victorious contempt. He knew he'd scared what was left of the living daylights out of Henry. \"That was fun, guys!\" Chloe cried. \"Let's do it again! Henry, it's your turn this time...\" Henry shook his head and took a quick glance down at his watch. It was just after nine. \"It's bedtime, Chloe,\" Henry replied, his voice gentle, but firm. Mark nodded. \"Yeah. And I'm gonna read you and your little cousins a story.\" Chloe frowned and shook her head vehemently. \"Uh-uh. I want Henry to read us a story.\" In the pallid shadows cast by the flashlight, Henry could see Mark's eyes narrow into menacing slits. Just like a snake. In a marathon session that lasted over a half-hour, Henry read as many as three stories of varying lengths to Chloe and his brother and sister. Somewhere near the end of the first story, the lights finally came back on, and Henry switched the flashlight off and set it aside. They were all curled up on the sofa in the living room, and everyone except Henry had started to doze off by the time he reached the third story, the one by Edward Lear about little colored people going to sea in a sieve. \"And when the sieve turned round and round, and everyone cried, 'You'll all be drowned!' they called aloud, 'Our sieve ain't big. But we don't care a button, we don't give a fig!'\" Chloe suddenly looked up and jumped a little on the sofa beside Henry. Henry stopped and followed her gaze. Standing in the middle of the room was Mark, grinning like he had just won the lottery. He was quick to adopt a rather facetious, sing-song voice. \"Quarter to ten. Time for lights out, kids.\" Henry glared at him. \" I'll turn them off when I'm done.\" Mark just gave him a smile and left the room. Henry then cleared his throat and finally resumed the story. \"'In a sieve we'll go to sea!' Far and few, far and few are the lands where the Jumblies live; their heads are green, and their hands are blue, and they went to sea in a sieve.\" Chloe's eyes now drifted shut, and she let out a contented sigh, as if letting go of the memory of that day. If only it were that easy ... Henry set the book down on the coffee table, and gingerly laid blankets over Chloe, Connie, and Richard's sleeping forms. He then turned off the lights and walked out to the kitchen to retrieve a soda for himself. As he opened up the refrigerator, Henry suddenly found himself face-to-face with Mark, who had seemingly materialized out of thin air. \"That was a darling story, Henry,\" Mark said, a smirk creasing his face. Henry immediately tensed and felt Mark move away from him. Toward the living room. Henry's arm reflexively shot out and seized Mark by the elbow. \"And just what do you think you're doing?\" Henry asked, his voice icy. Mark winked at him. \"I'm just going to check on my little sis and cousins. Make sure they're okay sleeping down here.\" \"They're perfectly fine where they are,\" Henry replied tersely. \"Eh... we'll see, now won't we?\" Henry quickly stepped into Mark's path, but Mark faked to his left and went right around Henry, who instantly turned and followed his cousin back into the semi-darkened living room. I guess he must've learned basketball a little better than he let on ... Mark stood by the coffee table and stared down at Connie and Richard before focusing his attention on his own sister. Chloe had fallen asleep with her head tilted to one side, leaving her neck vulnerably exposed. Henry tensed as Mark reached out to touch it. \" Aww ... Such sweet little things,\" Mark said, his tone filled with mockery and laughter. He straightened up and turned toward Henry in the half-light. \"Do you really think I would hurt her? Or any of them, for that matter?\" They stared into each other's eyes. Henry nodded slowly. \"Yes, I do,\" he said. He thought perhaps Mark would get angry, but the kid just smiled. As if he was proud of that fact. Chloe stirred and muttered something unintelligible under her breath. Both boys turned and looked at her. Henry felt Mark's hand on his shoulder, and it squeezed uncomfortably. \"Are you going to stand watch over them?\" Mark asked. \"All night?\" Henry slapped his cousin's hand away and turned to glare at him. \"Yeah, if that's what it takes, I will.\" Mark just stared back at him with those empty eyes of his before simply shrugging and leaving the room altogether. And judging by his footsteps, he was going back upstairs. That was a small mercy. Henry stood there in the middle of the living room and looked around. He sighed. It looked like he was going to be spending the night on the sofa with the kids. Carefully edging around the coffee table, he retrieved a fallen pillow from the floor and placed it behind his head as he sat back on the sofa. This was going to be a long night. This was the last straw for Janice. First there was Jack's poorly concealed displeasure with his role in this little campaign, and then there was his thing for Joan. He obviously thought that his own wife was blind to his indiscretion, but Janice wasn't stupid. Another thought suddenly reemerged: The kids hadn't answered the phone last time she had called. Maybe they would a second time. Besides, it would give her an excuse to get away from Jack for the moment. She stood up from her seat and stalked toward the front door, cellphone in-hand once again. \"Janice!\" Jack Evans' protest rang hollow in his wife's ears. Yet again, the shrill blaring of the landline rang out, but this time, someone actually did answer. It was Mark, and he had retrieved the phone from his parents' room. His mom was on the other end. That much was obvious. \"Hello? Mark, is that you?\" \"Hi, Mom. Yeah, it's me,\" Mark replied, a small laugh in his voice. Janice breathed a sigh of relief. \"That's great, hon. I was worried when you didn't pick up earlier.\" \"Sorry about that. And don't worry about a thing, Mom,\" he said, trying to keep his voice as soothing as possible. \"Everything here is fine – just fine.\" Two hours later, a loud click and rattle echoed in the entryway as a key was turned in the lock and the door thrown open. Janice burst through and switched on the hall light. She looked around rather anxiously, but saw nothing out of place for the moment. But there was a strange feel to the atmosphere. Out of the ordinary. Behind her, Jack was carrying on the argument they had been having in the car on the way back from the restaurant. \"...which makes it all so completely insane! You get jealous, you walk out on my first – and only speech – and to top it off, you get these crazy ideas about me and Joan. You think I want to spend my evenings doing this stuff, Janice? Huh? Well, this was the last time. From now on, count me out...\" Janice registered this with a feeling of disappointment, but she more or less ignored him for now. \"I'm going to do some reading. Don't wait up for me,\" Jack huffed angrily. With that, he stalked off down the hall to his study and slammed the door shut behind him. Once Jack had isolated himself in his study, an eerily oppressive silence descended upon the house. Janice rather absently hung up her jacket and went into the living room. There, she was somewhat surprised to see Chloe, Connie, and Richard all curled up asleep on the sofa and wrapped in blankets. But what puzzled Janice the most was to see Henry asleep on the sofa as well. To one side, his arm lay on Chloe's shoulders, while the other lay protectively across his siblings. It seemed a little odd, but Janice smiled nonetheless. This was a rather precious scene here. Intent on capturing the moment, she quickly took a picture with her phone and then shoved the device into her pocket before retrieving an afghan from the back of the rocking chair. She carefully draped it over Henry and gave him a slight, gentle pat on the head. A moment later, she left the room and made her way up the stairs to Mark's room. The door was slightly ajar, with dim light from downstairs and outside showing her son's form beneath the covers on his bunk, his back facing her. She stood there for a moment and gazed at him. He appeared to be fast asleep. Satisfied that her fears had been unfounded, Janice quietly shut Mark's door and headed into her own room for the night. Little did she know that her son was as far from sleep as one could possibly get. It was true that he lay still in his bed, but had Janice been able to see his face, she would have known that his eyes were open, pupils wide and as black and cold as the darkest night. A/N: Well? What'd y'all think? Please, keep the comments and reviews coming. Was Mark creepy enough here to surpass the original Henry of TGS? And as you can see, I finally found a use for Mark's katana sword. It'll be making one final appearance sometime in the last few chapters. As for Richard's seeming reversal to Henry's side, unfortunately, it's only temporary. Richard's fear of the dark temporarily surpassed that of his anger toward Henry. What happens next? Mark's plan for Chloe is put into motion, with a ripple effect than will be felt for the rest of the story. Stay tuned.[Chapter 18] Chapter 18 - Chloe December 18 Henry opened his eyes. He was lying on the sofa in a room filled with light. It was finally morning. A blue afghan blanket covered him. For a moment, he wasn't certain what he was doing there. Then it all came back to him in a rush. The memories of the night before... He sat up and blearily looked around. And that was when he realized that his brother and sister were gone. So was Chloe... Consumed by an overwhelming panic, Henry tossed the blanket aside and bolted up from the sofa. He hurriedly went over to the windows and looked out into the front yard. There was no one there. Now in full-blown panic mode, Henry ran from the living room and into the dining room, hurriedly checking the windows one-by-one to see if Chloe, his siblings, or even Mark for that matter, were outside. It was a fruitless search. Just as he was heading in the direction of the kitchen, he heard voices. Strained and emotional voices. Peering around the corner, Henry could see Jack, with an arm resting on Janice's shoulder in a comforting way. Janice's head was bent toward the floor, and her voice was choked with tears. \"I can't explain it,\" she was saying. \"Is it Matthew's room?\" Jack asked gently. \"That's part of it.\" \"Look, to be honest, I don't care about the room,\" Jack said. \"If it helps you somehow to leave it the way it is, then that's fine.\" Janice looked up at him, eyes pleading. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes,\" Jack said reassuringly. \"But there's more to it than that. You've got to stop blaming yourself for Matthew's death. It wasn't your fault.\" \"But I left him all on his own in the bath,\" she said. \"If it makes you feel any better, I would have done the exact same, Janice. It was a freak accident and nothing else. And it was what any good parent would have done, too. You told yourself that there was no way a two year-old who was as steady as he was on his own feet could possibly drown in six inches of water.\" \"No one else left him to answer the phone,\" Janice replied. \"I did!\" \"Hey, hey...\" Jack wrapped an arm around his wife. \"That's no way to talk, Janice. You can't go on thinking it was your fault for the rest of your life. It's not healthy for anything.\" \"I know,\" Janice said. \"But – but no matter what, I still blame myself. I – I can't help it...\" \"You've got to,\" Jack said. \"Just look what it's doing to us. We're at each other's throats half the time now.\" Janice nodded and buried her head in Jack's shoulder. \"I'm sorry about last night, Jack. If I seemed a bit too distant and distracted...\" \"And I'm sorry if I came across as a bit of an ass,\" Jack replied. \"When we get angry, we say things we don't really mean. That's just how last night was, I guess.\" \"You know that I didn't mean to ignore you and push you away like that. We need to protect the children we have left, and sometimes it's difficult.\" \"I know it is,\" Jack replied. He touched foreheads with Janice and then looked up at the clock over the stove. \"I have to go now, sweetheart.\" \"Are you sure?\" Janice asked. \"You know I wouldn't go if I didn't have to,\" Jack said. Now that sounded familiar to Henry. Jack hugged his wife. \"I love you.\" \"I love you, too,\" Janice replied, her voice a strained whisper. From the dining room entryway, Henry watched his uncle turn and leave. Henry mulled over what he had just heard. So, six inches of water... he thought. That was what Matthew had drowned in. At that age, Richard had been very steady on his feet, too, and surprisingly well-coordinated for a two year-old. If Matthew had been anything like Richard – and, judging by what Henry had just heard from Jack and Janice's conversation, he had – the very idea of him accidentally drowning himself in the bathtub bordered on absurd. Consequently, Henry had a rather hard time believing that it was true. But how else could it have happened? Mark. Henry tried to shake the thought from his mind. It was a terrible, awful thought. Yet, if there was anyone in the world who could do it, it was Mark. And what he'd said about Matthew last night, then back at the docks last week. He'd actually seen his little brother dead? The thought was sickening. He slowly walked from the dining room, hoping to give Janice a chance to compose herself. She had turned away and now faced the kitchen sink with her head bowed. Henry coughed twice, to alert his aunt that he was on his way. Janice whirled around and looked in his direction. She smiled at him, but Henry could tell that her heart wasn't in it. \"Good morning, Henry,\" she said halfheartedly. Henry nodded in reply. \"Do you want some breakfast?\" He shook his head. \"I'm not really that hungry this morning, Janice. But thanks for the thought.\" Janice looked thoughtful for a moment. \"Then if you're not too busy, would you like to help me make some bread? I can usually make it by myself, but having an extra pair of hands speeds things up.\" Henry nodded. \"Sure. Maybe I'll learn a thing or two about cooking in the process.\" \"Have you ever actually made bread before?\" Janice asked. Henry shook his head and followed her over to the island counter, where an amorphous gray lump sat in a silver mixing bowl. \"Well, then you're in luck. I always like to do it on an open day, when I have nothing else to do. Your job will be to knead the dough. That takes a lot of strength. Now, you'll need to wash your hands first.\" As Henry washed his hands, and then dried them off on a kitchen towel, he noticed an inactive tablet leaning against the side of the refrigerator. He took it in hand and turned it back on. Whoever had been reading it last, they had been looking at the news, and prominently displayed was the headline ' A New Threat ? ' with the picture of an all-too familiar stretch of the SR 1 below it. Trying his best to shake the memories of yesterday from his head, Henry returned to the mixing bowl to help Janice. \"Use your knuckles and push it in as far as you can,\" she was saying. Without saying a word, and now totally focused on the task at hand, Henry did just that. \"That's it,\" Janice said, smiling a little. \"Now, turn it over...\" After a few minutes of kneading and pounding the dough with his fists, Henry finally screwed up his courage, determined to let his aunt know the truth. \"You know that big accident out on the main road...\" \"Why'd you sleep on the sofa last night?\" Janice suddenly asked, inadvertently cutting Henry off and catching him off-guard. \"You could have gone back upstairs anytime.\" \"I was reading stories to the kids and, well... I guess I must've dozed off. We had a pretty big night last night. Wore ourselves out real good.\" \"I should say,\" Janice replied. \"Mark told me all about it.\" For a second, Henry held his breath. \"Hide and seek can wear a person out like none other,\" Janice said. Henry nodded in agreement. \"I haven't played it with Chloe for a long time,\" she continued. \"Speaking of which, Chloe that is, you've been spending a lot more time with her and Connie lately. Is it because you and Mark aren't getting along? Or is it the way Richard's been ignoring you? One of those must be the reason you wanted to talk with me last night before we left.\" Henry took in another deep breath and prepared to start his initial conversation over again. Janice might've given him another opportunity here, and he was certainly going to make the most of it. \"Well, no, I'm not really getting along with either of them right now...\" \"Is Mark being a little hostile?\" Henry took in another breath, gave a slight nod and continued kneading the dough. It was sometimes rather difficult to keep up with the pace of an adult's reasoning skills. Janice, meanwhile, was simply content to be getting to the heart of whatever was going on between her son and her older nephew. \"You see, Mark pretty much had things to himself before you and your sibs got here. Chloe was hardly a rival. But you're good for him, Henry. Competition. I know he respects you. He'll come around – you'll see. Don't worry.\" Don't worry ... Easier said than done. Henry bit his lip and tried again. Janice seemed to be getting away from where he wanted their conversation to go. \"He doesn't like the girls. He hates –\" \"Hey now... That's putting it a bit strongly, don't you think? Kids your age don't typically dote on little sisters and girls in general. You're an unfortunate rarity.\" She then walked up and stood close to inspect his work. \"You're doing a good job there...\" Janice said. Henry paid her comment virtually no heed. \"But now look what's happened. You pay Chloe and your sister some extra attention, perhaps just to be a good friend, or because you're angry with Mark and want to make him jealous. So, to show everyone that he's the real big brother around here, he took Richard and the girls down to the beach...\" Henry's fingers suddenly clenched into the dough, his mind now locked in a state of panic. \"No, no, he went alone...\" \"Uh-uh. That's what I mean when I say you're good for him, Henry. Besides, it might be the last time they get this chance to go out there. The beach will be gone before New Years', despite everything that we've done over the past year...\" Registering this news with a small measure of disappointment, Henry began backing away from his aunt, who was facing away from him and scrubbing dishes in the sink. \"He thought it would be a good idea to take the kids along. He's always seen younger girls, Chloe especially, as nothing but a little nuisance. Now he wants to take her – and your sister – swimming. A transformation...\" She then noticed his sudden absence. \"Henry? Henry! Where are you going?\" In the time that she'd been talking, Henry had backed out into the hall and made his way over to the door. In a daze of fear and urgency, he practically jumped into his shoes, threw open the front door, and ran like a madman down the driveway in the direction of the road. \"Henry!\" Janice cried out, running to the front door. She continued calling after him, but her voice slowly faded into the background while Henry sprinted as fast as his legs could possibly carry him. Barely halfway down the road into town, Henry's lungs were already burning, and his breath came in short gasps, but he pushed onward. Not far ahead of him, a trio of girls wearing brightly-colored bathing suits walked along with towels wrapped around their shoulders, rather busily talking amongst themselves. They were so involved in their conversation that they barely noticed Henry in time to jump out of the way as he ran pell-mell past them. Just around the next curve in the road, he finally spotted the promontory where Janice liked to go, the one by the beach. And there was a din of noise coming from that direction as well. He was almost there. His heart beating wildly, Henry raced up to the edge of the promontory and stopped at the guardrail to catch his breath. Below lay the beach, with well over a hundred people either scattered along the water's edge or farther back from the shore, sunning themselves or napping under umbrellas. Henry scanned the mass of humanity below, desperately searching for any sign of Mark, Chloe, or his own siblings, but there were far too many kids to tell one from the other. But he had to find them, and warn them before it was too late. If it wasn't already... \"Chloe!\" he bawled at the top of his lungs. \" Connie! Richard! \" But his cries were lost amidst the noise of people below. Henry now continued his run through a nearby parking lot and started down the slope to the beach, stumbling every so often in the soft sand and dirt underfoot. \" Chloe! Connie! \" As he got closer, he could start to distinguish individuals from the crowd, but many of their faces were unfamiliar to Henry. \" Richard! \" Exhausted, and too focused on scanning the crowd, Henry suddenly slipped and fell on his rear end. Not only that, but his momentum carried him the rest of the way and he slid down to the beach, flat on his back. His fall dazed him for a short time, but as soon as he regained his footing, he once again raced ahead, now more desperate than ever to find his siblings and Chloe. Off to his right, he saw a small, blond-haired boy sitting on a towel under an umbrella, wearing neon orange swim trunks and a ragged white t-shirt that appeared several sizes too big for him. That has to be Richard! No other kid wore clothes like that to the beach. Henry dashed forward and dived onto the sand in front of the umbrella. The boy let out a little yelp of surprise. Then a look of recognition dawned on his face, and he glared at Henry. \"Henny! What ya do 'at for?\" he asked in a pouting voice. Henry sat up and blinked a few grains of sand from his eyelids. Then he looked over at his little brother. \"I didn't know where you were, Rich. You shouldn't go off without telling me first!\" \"But Mark wanted to take us! And you were still asleeping, Henny. Besides, you don't let me do any-thing anymore!\" Henry resisted the urge to sigh. Unfortunately, Richard still seemed to hold a grudge against him, as if last night hadn't even occurred. But, he'd have to deal with this later. \"Richard, where's Conse? And Chloe?\" Henry asked. Just then, a shadow fell across Henry and he looked up to see Maggie Goldblum standing over him. \"Well, hello there, Henry,\" she said in a friendly voice. Henry nodded. \"Maggie.\" \"You come out to join us on this unusually fine day?\" Maggie asked as she kneeled down into the sand and sat under the umbrella near Richard. Henry shook his head. Then he decided to ask her what he'd asked Richard. \"Have you seen the girls?\" he asked. \"Girls? Oh, you mean Chloe and your sister?\" \"Yes! Have you seen them?\" Maggie nodded, smiling. \"Oh, yes. They're out in the water with Mark...\" That was all Henry needed. He scrambled up and began running toward the lapping surf, leaving a bewildered Maggie behind. He frantically weaved through clusters of people before finally reaching the water's edge. There were dozens out swimming, enough that he couldn't immediately distinguish any distinct faces. And then he saw them: A brown-haired boy, swimming farther out than anyone else, hand-in-hand with a younger girl. That had to be Mark and Chloe. But where was Connie? Henry darted forward into the water, ignoring the slight chill that it gave him. It was a good thing he'd worn shorts last night. He was just about waist-deep when he finally spotted Connie. His sister was halfway between him and Mark, swimming and diving almost like a pro, but she still sported bright pink water wings on either arm nonetheless. \" Connie! \" he called out. \"Conse! Over here!\" Connie stopped, hung in the water for a few seconds, and began paddling toward her brother. When she finally caught up with him, she was out of breath, but had a grin on her face to beat the band. Her long brown hair was pasted to her head and she wore swim goggles over her eyes. \"Henry! I was wondering when you'd finally get a mind to join us, sleepyhead!\" Henry took his sister's hand and began pulling her in the direction of the beach. \"Henry!\" she protested. \"What are you doing? I was havin' fun out there!\" \"Conse, I need you to go back to where Miss Goldblum and Richard are.\" \"Why?\" \"Can you please do that for me? OK?\" Connie pouted. They now stood back up on the sand, mere feet from the water. \"Please, Connie,\" Henry said, laying a hand on her shoulder. He was now pleading. \"I wouldn't tell you if it wasn't important.\" His little sister finally nodded, but just as she started to walk away, a loud, strangled cry went up from the water. Far out. That sounded like Chloe! Henry whirled around and stared hard in the direction he had last seen his cousins. He could just make out Mark, wildly floundering in the blue water like a fish on dry land. Then he abruptly went under. Seconds later, he bobbed to the surface a fair distance away, spluttering and coughing water. \"Chloe!\" Mark screamed in seeming desperation. \" Chloe! \" Once more, Henry took the plunge and frantically set out for Mark's position. Mark's cries now began to draw attention. People out in the water were swimming toward him, and to where Chloe had disappeared. Others back on the beach were milling about at the water's edge, their eyes locked on the unfolding scene nearly a half-mile distant. Now Mark yelled at those swimming in his direction. \"There's an undercurrent out here! Get back!\" His words instantly stopped over a dozen swimmers, all potential rescuers, right in their tracks. But not Henry. He kept on going without abandon. He had to save Chloe. He had to. \"She went under!\" Mark was screaming. \"I can't find her!\" Just then, a pair of strong arms grappled around Henry and held tight. He flailed his arms and legs to no use. He ceased struggling and turned to the person who had stopped him. It was none other than Chuck Parks, Alan's dad. \"I have to get out there, Mr. Parks,\" Henry gasped. \"You can't, Henry. It's too dangerous.\" \"But Chloe! She'll drown!\" \"And so could you!\" Alan's father snapped. Henry realized that whatever happened next was, unfortunately, beyond his control. Moments later, another swimmer practically flew past, darting through the water and kicking up a wake behind them. Unlike Henry, no one stopped this person, who was soon in the general area of where Chloe had disappeared. In a flash, they dived under the surface of the water. For one long, agonizing moment, nothing happened. In the distance, the wailing of emergency sirens reached Henry's ears, and drew ever nearer with each second that ticked by. No ... This couldn't happen again. Not to Chloe! Would death forever haunt this family? Suddenly, a figure broached the surface, clinging to something for dear life. It was Chloe's limp body. Then, with some effort, the mystery rescuer began dragging her toward the shore. \"He found her!\" someone yelled. Several of the swimmers began to cheer, and now moved in to help. \"Was she under too long?\" Henry asked Mr. Parks. The man shrugged. \"I don't know, Henry.\" \"But she still has a chance, r-right?\" Henry asked, his voice desperate. \"Yes,\" Chuck Parks replied. \"A chance.\" Then Henry felt him let go. He immediately bolted toward the shore, where a crowd was gathering around Chloe and her rescuer. Henry pushed his way past the grouping and saw for the first time that the mystery rescuer was none other than Alan Parks himself. At the moment, he was doing his best to give Chloe CPR. Henry kneeled down beside him and stared at Chloe's prone form in shock. Her arms lay limp, her light brown hair was plastered to her face, and her eyes were closed. Even worse, she didn't appear to be breathing. Henry felt tears begin to well up in his eyes. No. She couldn't be... But just as he was ready to begin mourning a family member once again, a loud coughing and spluttering noise, along with a copious amount of water, escaped Chloe's mouth. She was alive! Henry wept in relief. \"She's okay!\" someone cried out. \"Make a hole!\" someone else shouted. \"EMS is here!\" Henry and Alan backed up, and the crowd parted to admit a man and woman with a stretcher and an oxygen tank in tow. The man quickly laid the stretcher out on the sand, while the woman put an oxygen mask over Chloe's mouth. Acting in concert, the EMTs lifted her onto the stretcher, strapped her down, and carried her back up the beach to where an ambulance was waiting. They hurriedly bundled her onto a gurney in the back, the doors slamming shut in their wake. Another uniformed man thumped his fist on the doors, and the ambulance took off in the direction of town, lights pulsing and siren wailing. Henry rubbed the tears from his eyes and turned to Alan. \"You saved her,\" he said. Alan offered him a slight smile. \"Well, they didn't give me a silver medal at the state swim meet for nothing. Strange thing, though. Mark said that there was an undercurrent where he and Chloe went under, but when I got out there, there wasn't one.\" Speaking of Mark ... Where was he? Henry quickly excused himself from Alan's company and went in search of his cousin. Not ten feet away, another crowd – smaller, this time – had gathered around someone else, someone who was sobbing rather loudly. With each step, the sobbing seemed to grow louder in Henry's ears. He edged his way up to a gap in the circle of people and saw that Mark was seated on a towel in the middle of it. Another towel was clenched tightly about his shoulders, and he was shivering like a leaf. Mark's head was bowed and his body was wracked by sobs. A middle-aged woman was kneeled beside him and had a comforting hand on his shoulder. If only everyone here knew that it was nothing but an act on Mark's part. He ought to be in films ... Henry thought. For a brief second, Mark looked up, and the boys' eyes met. Henry knew that look in his cousin's eyes. There was absolutely no sorrow or shame in them, despite the tears that they let out. What Henry saw there was the look of a long-expected victory. Then Mark bent to his sorrow once again. Henry simply turned away and walked off in disgust. A/N: Obviously, no ice-skating. I hope I handled the replacement well. And how about Alan Parks' return? And now for a sneak peek at the next chapter: Will Henry finally get to tell the truth about Mark, or will fate intervene yet again? Stay tuned for Chapter 19: 'Accusations' .[Chapter 19] Chapter 19 - Accusations Janice was out in the living room and sitting at the piano, waiting for the bread to bake. At the moment, she was playing Chloe's rendition of ' the Star-Spangled Banner ' from the concert. \"O, say can you see...\" But even as she sang the lyrics, Janice's mind continued to wander, and she gazed over the photographs sitting at eye-level, a wistful and solemn smile on her face. That day at the beach two summers ago. Chloe and Mark had been so happy then. \"...by the dawn's early light...\" Then there was last December, and that visit to Mammoth Mountain. There, Chloe had face-planted in the snow while skiing, and somehow Mark had gone right past her without ever slowing down or even noticing. Now that Janice thought about it, it did seem a tad strange. On the plus side, they'd all enjoyed the chair lifts. At the time, Chloe had been reminded of an amusement park ride. \"...What so proudly we hailed, at the twilight's last gleaming...\" As the seconds went by, Janice's mind wandered even further, but to a more recent time. Specifically, that morning. What was going on with Henry? His behavior had become somewhat erratic over the past few days. First there was him running upstairs like a bat out of hell the other night, the night of the concert. \"...Whose broad stripes and bright stars...\" Then there was last night. He'd quite obviously had something on his mind, but couldn't seem to verbalize it. Whatever it was, it had to be the source of his behavior. It had to be. Now this morning... She had almost been able to get Henry to come out of his shell and talk about it, but then he ran out of the house right in the middle of their conversation, right after her explaining part of Mark's recent and quite sudden transformation. \"...through the perilous fight...\" For a minute, Janice inadvertently thought back to her conversation with Jack that morning, and once again began thinking about Matthew. How had he drowned? And why? It was a question she'd asked herself almost every day, almost every waking hour, since the terrible thing had happened just over three years ago. Janice had been alone in the house with Mark and Matthew that day, while Jack had gone to pick Chloe up from a friend's. She had been helping Matthew get a bath when the phone rang. The closest extension being in her and Jack's room, she had left Matthew sitting by himself in the tub while she went to answer it. After talking with Linnie Parks – Alan's mother – to arrange a sleepover for Mark and Alan later that week, Janice had returned to the bathroom, only to find Matthew, her baby, facedown and unmoving. In six inches of water. Had he somehow stood up in the tub and slipped? No, she would've heard him fall, and cry out, too. But what other possibility did that leave? Mark? No! Janice quickly banished that thought from her mind. It was so horrid that she admonished herself for even daring to think it. Such ran contrary to her instincts as a mother. At that moment, her cellphone rang, abruptly jolting Janice out of her thoughts. It was Jack. She answered. \"Jack? What is it?\" Her husband's voice was filled with emotion and a healthy dose of panic. \"Janice, you need to come down to the hospital right away!\" \"Why? What's happened?\" \"It's Chloe, Jan. She and Mark got caught in an undercurrent at the beach. Mark's perfectly fine, but Chloe...\" Janice rose from her seat at the piano, a sense of fear and apprehension rapidly building within her. \"Well?!\" Jack struggled with his words. \"Chloe had to be... revived. She's in the ER right now, but she's been unconscious for over an hour.\" Janice's breath came in short, sharp gasps. From the moment she hung up the phone, she didn't slow down, or even stop moving, for that matter. On the way to town, she probably broke a half-dozen traffic laws. By the time she got to the hospital, a large, single-story building that everyone called 'the Clinic', the van's engine was on the verge of smoking. Not even stopping to lock it up, Janice raced across the parking lot and crashed through the front doors, desperately searching for a sign of her husband's presence. She ran down the corridor and looked in either direction, all the while focusing on a singular thought: This can't be happening again! Was her family cursed, doomed by fate to die off in horrible accidents one-by-one? Far down the corridor off to her left, Jack was standing outside a small room, conversing with a young doctor dressed in green scrubs that Janice only vaguely recognized. Dr. McCann, wasn't it? As Janice ran closer, she could see the kids, all seated on chairs just outside the room. They were unusually quiet. Even Richard, normally filled with a barely-containable energy that reminded Janice so much of her Matthew, was somber and huddled up against Mark, his small body almost completely hidden inside a huge blue beach towel. Henry sat off to their side and had a comforting arm around a shuddering Connie. When Jack saw his wife running toward him, he reached out his arms and embraced her. Janice was babbling. \"I can't believe it... I can't... Oh, God! Jack, hold me... Chloe's...\" \"Chloe's going to be just fine, Janice,\" Jack said, a grim smile on his face. \"She's going to make it!\" Janice cried out in relief. \"Then she's fine, and-and if there's not any damage... She's going to be all right... But they'll probably want to do some tests... Even though she's... I couldn't... Oh, not again... not again...\" She buried her face in Jack's shoulder and wept openly. For the first time in a long time, Janice heard her husband cry as well. Dr. Scott McCann stood nearby, patiently waiting for them. He was all smiles, but, as discreetly as possible, he raised a hand to his face and wiped tears from his eyes. Chloe Evans would be all right. The girl lay on her back in an oversize hospital bed, eyes closed and presumably still unconscious, an IV feed and heart monitor attached to her arm. Jack, Janice, and Mark stood over her, while Henry and his siblings sat on a second, empty bed opposite from them. Janice had her arm lovingly wrapped around Mark's shoulders and drew him in close. \"I should have tried harder...\" Mark was saying, his voice filled with shame. Janice shook her head and squeezed her son's shoulders. \"Don't talk like that. What you did was brave, and it was everything you could have done, Mark. And we're both proud of you. Right, Jack?\" Jack silently nodded in agreement and gave them a little smile. \"You know that, don't you?\" Janice continued. \"You're my brave little one...\" Henry was currently lost in thought. He hadn't seen everything that had gone on earlier. Consequently, he couldn't be a hundred-percent certain that Mark had purposely tried to drown Chloe. Maybe there really had been a current out there that'd dragged them under. Maybe it had simply dissipated, or something, before Alan got out there. But logic refused to offer a different answer. His own mind was trying to make up excuses for Mark, and it disgusted Henry. But it was, unfortunately, a part of human nature to do so, whether it was for oneself or not. Even though he hadn't seen it directly, and didn't know exactly how, Henry knew that Mark had tried to drown his own sister that day. He simply couldn't let this stand any longer. Janice had to know the truth, before Mark tried something else. Before that something turned truly deadly... December 19 The following day, well after breakfast and just before lunchtime, Henry took a walk along the road heading into town. He was out here to clear his head, but was more specifically following Janice, who had gone out on a walk of her own just after breakfast was over. On his way to the promontory where Henry knew she would be, he passed a couple of construction workers putting up a large metal sign just beyond the guardrail. The sign itself was a bright, yellow-orange color with bold black lettering, announcing the intended development of the beach in the near-future. The weather seemed to match his mood as well. The sky was significantly grayer than yesterday and clouds scudded across the horizon, while the wind drove waves against the shore with frenzied, tumultuous crashes, sending spray high into the air. Just ahead, he could see Janice standing out on the promontory, staring down at the beach below. But she suddenly turned around and watched him slowly approach. Was it intuition, or did she know he'd been following her? Without a single word passing between the two of them, Henry walked up beside Janice and joined her near the end of the point. In barely a day, the beach had been utterly transformed, and it wasn't a pretty sight to behold. Rolls of wire fencing were piled along one side of the slope while a row of white pickup trucks were parked off to the other. Men in orange vests and hardhats were already swarming all over the beach, and had recently finished setting up a modified office trailer, around which they had begun setting up a fence topped with razor wire. Other men were unloading large boxes from a nearby Jeep and carrying them into the trailer. \"Aren't you supposed to be at Maggie's?\" Janice asked, not turning to face Henry when she spoke. He shrugged, but nodded ever so slightly. \"Yes.\" Even after hearing that, Janice didn't really seem to care. She just kept on staring down at the beach. \"All of this will be gone soon. All of it.\" Henry nodded. \"Sometimes I think the whole world is going mad,\" Janice said. \"Yes,\" Henry replied. Now Janice finally turned to him. \"What's wrong, Henry? You've been hovering around and following me. There is something, isn't there?\" \"Yes,\" Henry said, and then his voice suddenly grew uncertain. \"Well, I mean, I'm not really sure...\" \"What was going on yesterday?\" Janice asked. \"You ran from the house and came down here. And what about the other night, when you slept on the sofa? Something was upsetting you.\" She then took his hand in hers and looked him in the eye. \"You can speak to me, Henry. We trust each other, don't we?\" Henry then drew in a deep breath. This was his chance. It was now or never. \"I don't know anything for sure. I mean, I didn't really see anything...\" \"Tell me,\" Janice said, encouraging him to go on. Henry stuttered ever so slightly. \"I – I don't think that what happened yesterday was an accident.\" His aunt raised an eyebrow. \"What are you saying?\" \"No one else was that far out. Mark said he and Chloe got caught in an undercurrent, but when Alan went out, there wasn't any. Mark might've deliberately...\" \"Henry!\" Janice backed away in astonishment. But Henry kept on talking at an ever-increasing pace. \"He said that he hated her. You don't know who he is. No one will believe me. He made this device in an old hideout of his in the woods. He used it to...\" Now Janice held up a hand to cut him off. The look on her face was one of incredulity and downright disgust at what Henry had been saying. \"Slow down and tell me simply. What exactly is it that you're trying to say?\" Henry sighed. \"I've told you, and now I'm telling you again. You don't know Mark – you don't know who he is and what he's capable of. Chloe didn't go under by accident. Mark tried to kill –\" At that same moment, Janice delivered a violent and stinging slap across his face that sent Henry reeling backwards in pain and shock. \"How dare you talk to me like that!\" Janice snapped angrily. \"It's nothing but nasty, vicious jealousy! Do you think you can get between Mark and me? That's what you're trying to do here, isn't it? Haven't we all given you enough?! Do you think that you can take everything now?\" Shen then turned and stalked away, not even bothering to look back at him. Henry gingerly rubbed at his now-sore jaw and reddened cheek. For the second time in the past twenty-four hours, he was on the verge of tears. This time it was not out of sadness, however, but betrayal and total rejection. Until this moment, Henry had considered Janice his strongest ally. Now, he had probably driven her away for good. For the moment, he was totally speechless, and had no idea of what to do next. A pair of young, well-used hands held a steel file in their grip, and began applying pressure to the piece of dull golden metal before them, which was clamped tightly into a vise. A recognizable shape soon began to emerge as the work progressed: A key. \"That's what I'm telling you, Wallace,\" Janice said into the phone, her voice brittle and impatient. \"Henry's been saying that?\" Wallace asked, slightly incredulous. \"Yes,\" Janice replied. \"I thought that you should know what's been going on here.\" \"Janice, is he there?\" Janice quickly passed the phone to Henry, but didn't move a single inch and remained where she was. \"Henry, what's going on?\" Henry wasn't sure at all what to say. \"I... I don't know...\" he stuttered. \"What are these things you've been saying about Mark?\" his father asked. Henry glanced up at Janice uncertainly. He badly needed to confide in his father, but his aunt remained a close, angry presence. \"It's... No one believes me, Dad. You've got to come quickly. I want you to help me. I can't do this on my own...\" Henry cringed and whimpered ever so slightly when he saw Janice glowering at him. \"Henry? Is everything all right?\" Wallace's voice grew even more concerned when his son didn't answer. \"Henry?\" \"Hurry, Dad. Please...\" Henry whispered. Then he dropped the receiver onto the table and fled upstairs. Janice quickly retrieved the phone and continued her conversation with Wallace. Her tone was terse and angry. \"You see what I mean, Wallace? You've got to come back,\" she said. That evening, following a dinner from which Henry was conspicuously absent, Jack, Janice, and Mark sat on the sofa out in the living room. Mark sat between his parents and had his arms around his mother's neck in a loving way. He spoke softly and tenderly, using the full power of his calming charm to try and put her at ease. \"You know how before he came, you would always tell me that it wasn't going to be easy, that he and his sibs might be a little weird sometimes, and when that happened, I had to remember what they had been through..?\" Janice nodded ever so slightly. \"Please don't send them away, Mom,\" Mark pleaded. \"Especially Henry. He loves it here. I know he does. And I really want him to stay...\" A heavy sigh shook Janice's whole upper body. It was obvious that she would take very little persuading to give in to her son's request. She took Mark's hand in hers and squeezed it tightly. \"He's right, honey,\" Jack said. \"Henry's family has just suffered the biggest conceivable loss, and everything he says – and does – has to be seen in that light.\" \"Mom, please let him stay,\" Mark said. He was quite emphatic. For a few seconds, Janice appeared lost in thought before she finally responded. \"I just can't have him saying things like that about you, Mark. And, I just can't handle it, Jack. I never thought that it was going to be so difficult. But... I know you're both right. You're such a forgiving boy, Mark...\" \"Chloe will be home soon,\" Jack added. \"And this will all be behind us. Wallace might be back soon, anyway. He'll let us know, when, exactly. In the meantime, try and speak to Henry when you can... ah, here he is now.\" Henry stood out in the hall, too nervous to enter. \"Come on in, Henry,\" Jack said, waving to him. The blond-haired boy walked stiff-legged out into the middle of the room and glanced uncertainly at the trio on the sofa. Mark scooted closer to his father to make room for Henry, and Janice held out her arms to her nephew. Henry sat down and embraced her. \"I'm sorry, Henry... I'm sorry that I was so angry. It's all right now, it's all right...\" Henry was glad to put this behind him, and he quickly submitted to his aunt's reconciliation. But he also remained silent and uneasy as he closed his eyes and buried his face in Janice's shoulder. He was smart enough to know that this wasn't over yet. Not by a long shot. Beside them, Mark snuggled close with his father, smiling up at him in quiet triumph. Some time later, those same young hands removed the key from the vise, their work finally complete. They felt along the grooves in a delicate manner, as if admiring their work. This key would soon fulfill its' purpose, whatever that purpose might be... A/N: From here on out, I'll be using more from the 1991 draft, though some parts will still be my own unique ideas. As for the key, it's purpose will be revealed in time. And as always, reviews are greatly appreciated. Guest reviews are also welcome. On to Chapter 20![Chapter 20] Chapter 20 - Undermined December 20 All through that night, Henry's sleep was plagued by nightmares. Nightmares about Mark terrorizing him in various, indescribable ways. The only one he would later recall was one that took place at the railroad tracks where they had flattened pennies together not a week ago. He was trying to fight past Mark to get to Connie and Chloe when Richard suddenly intervened on Mark's behalf. Stunned by this betrayal, Henry nevertheless outflanked his little brother and his cousin, and finally got to the girls, who were both lying at odd angles between the metal rails, completely unconscious. To make matters worse, a train was bearing down on them at full speed. Using what precious time he had, Henry scooped up Connie first, and then Chloe, hauling them both to safety as far from the tracks as possible. But just as he thought everything would be all right, he felt a sudden, sharp pain in his back. Henry collapsed, his arms and legs totally paralyzed. Now completely helpless, Henry could do nothing but watch in horror as Mark dragged him back over to the tracks with surprising ease, and stood a 'safe' distance away, watching in sick amusement as the train continued to bear down on his cousin. Even worse, Richard was standing beside Mark, just staring at Henry in absent fascination. \" NO! \" Henry screamed. He wanted to reach a hand out to Richard, to beg him for help, but he couldn't even lift a finger. Literally. As the train closed in, the rails began to vibrate beneath Henry, shaking his body. Simultaneously, a loud rumbling noise filled the air around him, and the light from the train grew brighter with every second. \"Mark! Richard!\" he cried out. \"Someone, please!\" Neither of them even blinked. \"Henry!\" another voice shouted. That was Connie! \"Connie!\" he yelled. And then the train was upon him, the light, noise, and vibration at a fever pitch. \" NOOOO! \" Henry screamed in mortal terror. Henry's eyes flashed open. His clothes were drenched in sweat, and his sheets were tangled into a mess around him. The nightmare was finally over. Or was it? He could still feel a vibration of sorts from beneath him, and the rumbling noise still filled the air. Henry half-expected the train to come crashing through the wall at any moment, but at the same time, he realized that he was completely awake, and that what he was experiencing was real. Was this some kind of trick? Perhaps Mark was shaking the bed? Seconds later, when objects began toppling from the shelves around the room, Henry knew that this was no trick, either. In the dim early morning light, he watched a stack of DVDs crash onto the floor, followed by an entire shelf of books. And that was when Mark finally chose to wake up. He looked around in confusion for a few seconds, and then seemed to realize what was happening. He leapt up from his bunk, seized a flashlight, and ran from the room. \"Mom! Dad! Earthquake! \" he yelled at the top of his lungs. Henry's eyes widened. Earthquake? Like pretty much every American outside California and the West Coast, Henry only knew about them from the news and science classes at school. His only real memory of any significant quake was the one down in San Francisco four years ago, during the '89 World Series. But he had never actually been in one himself. Henry scrambled down from the bunk, nearly falling in the process, and ran out into the hall, walking almost like a drunkard. Acting on instinct alone, he immediately made a beeline for Richard's room and threw the door open. Surprisingly enough, the little boy was sound asleep in spite of the din around him. Henry launched himself inside and was just barely in time to shield his brother from a virtual wall of books that came crashing down from a nearby shelf. Richard suddenly awoke with a start and shrieked in terror. Fortunately for him, Henry took the brunt of the blow from the falling books. After another few agonizing seconds that seemed like an eternity, the shaking stopped, and the rumbling began to die down into nothingness. Henry released his death-grip hold on Richard, but still kept a comforting arm around the terrified little boy's shoulders. Richard was whimpering and, even in the dim light, Henry could tell that he was also on the verge of bursting into tears. Henry hugged his little brother close. \"It's okay, buddy. It's okay. It's all over...\" \"Is everyone all right?!\" a voice called out, just before the hall lights flickered on, casting shadows around the room. It was Jack. \"Uncle Jack!\" Jack stood in the doorway. \"Henry? Is that you?\" \"I'm with Richard! We're both fine.\" Their uncle breathed an audible sigh of relief. Henry's thoughts then flashed to someone else. \"Connie!\" he called out. After a few seconds, a tearful Connie came flying into Richard's room and threw her arms around Henry's neck. \"Oh, Henry!\" she cried. \"There, there, Conse,\" Henry replied, his voice gentle and reassuring. \"You're okay. It's all over now.\" \"I – I was so scared!\" \"I know,\" Henry said, a little smile on his face. \"So was I.\" \"Really?\" both of his siblings asked in unison. Henry nodded. \"I sure was. And, you both handled this better than I would have at either of your ages.\" \"Really?\" Connie and Richard both asked again, wiping tears from their eyes. \"Absolutely.\" In an unexpected move, Henry pulled both of them close and mercilessly tickled them, eliciting a fit of giggles from his siblings. For now, everything was just fine. \"...which measured this morning's quake at 5.7, centered roughly ten miles offshore Mendocino County. As of this hour, there are no fatalities in the affected region, though minor power outages have been reported as far north as Eureka...\" With that, Janice turned the radio over to a classical music station. That got an audible groan from Mark, but she simply ignored it. \"Do you think Chloe's all right?\" Connie suddenly piped up. Jack nodded from his seat beside Janice at the other side of the table. It was well after nine, but he wasn't going into work today. He was staying home to help clean up and perform damage assessment. \"The hospital is probably the sturdiest building in town. Chloe's just fine.\" When Henry looked over at Mark, he caught a strange look in his cousin's eyes. Was that disappointment? Like he'd been hoping she had somehow died! It was sickening. One positive side-effect of this morning's 'event' was that Richard seemed to be on much friendlier terms with Henry. Saving one's life tends to do that, even for a four year-old . Those falling books had made a bruised mess of Henry's back, which was still rather sore, but not to the point where it was debilitating, though he hadn't been of much help when Jack and Janice had been cleaning up the broken glass in the kitchen earlier. As he stared down at the table and twiddled with his thumbs, Henry thought back to yesterday. For reasons that were rather obvious, Janice didn't believe him about Mark and what he'd done. And if she didn't believe him, then maybe Maggie would. It was worth a shot, at least... Henry quickly excused himself from the table and went upstairs to Mark's room, to retrieve his phone, which he promptly used to call Maggie. She answered on the fourth ring. \"Hello?\" \"Miss Goldblum... Maggie – it's Henry. Henry Evans.\" \"Oh, hello there, Henry,\" she replied, sounding a little out of breath. \"Are you all right?\" Henry asked, raising an eyebrow. Maggie sighed ever so slightly. \"I'm fine, Henry. Thanks for your concern, but I've just been rather busy this morning, cleaning up after that big shaker.\" Henry bit his lip. Should he go over right now? Especially if she was too busy. Then another idea popped into his head. \"Maybe I could come over and help,\" he suggested. \"I'm not doing much right now, anyways.\" Maggie seemed to contemplate this for a second before replying. \"Come on over. I could use the company, and, I've got a lot to clean up.\" Henry nodded and was just about to reply when he heard a sudden click. \"Maggie? Are you still there?\" he asked. Had she hung up on him? \"I'm still here,\" Maggie replied. Henry breathed a sigh of relief. \"Oh, good. I thought you hung up on me for a sec.\" \"Why... Oh, never mind,\" Maggie said dismissively. \"Just come over as soon as you're able to.\" \"I'm just about to leave right now.\" The whole way out to Maggie's, Henry kept feeling like he was being followed, but every time he looked back, there was no one there. He just hoped that he wasn't becoming paranoid. When he finally got there, Maggie was waiting for him on the front porch, dressed in an old t-shirt and jeans and sipping from a glass of water. She quickly ushered Henry inside and set him to work in the living room, where he helped retrieve books scattered about the floor. His back protested ever so slightly, but Henry ignored it for now. He had to talk with Maggie. Reconsidering, for any reason, simply wasn't an option. It took him another few minutes before he was finally able to work up the nerve to talk openly. \"Maggie?\" \"Yes, Henry? What is it?\" Henry took in a deep breath. \"Could we talk?\" he asked. Maggie nodded and sat down in a nearby recliner. She gestured for Henry to sit as well, but he was far too nervous to do so. \"Okay then. What exactly did you want to talk about?\" Henry starting pacing the floor. \"It's Mark.\" \"What about Mark?\" A sigh escaped Henry's mouth. This was it. \"He's been doing these... things.\" \"What kind of things?\" Maggie asked. \"I thought it was nothing at first, but...\" \"But what, Henry?\" She was surprisingly patient. \"He hurts Chloe,\" Henry replied. \"He built this device that shoots steel bolts – he killed Captain Lawson's dog with it.\" Maggie frowned, but said nothing. \"And you know that explosion out on the main road? The one that caused that big pileup on the bridge?\" Maggie nodded. \"You see, Mark had this remote-control mini drone. He put something on it and deliberately crashed the thing into the bridge. He caused the entire pileup on purpose. Then, the other day, at the beach, what happened to Chloe wasn't an accident. I think Mark tried to drown her. On purpose. Now I don't know what he's going to do. He might go after the rest of his family – or mine.\" Maggie's face remained deadpan as she mulled over Henry's rambling speech. Then she began talking, her words smooth and seemingly unperturbed by this revelation. \"So he did all of this, but you couldn't speak to me about it until now?\" Henry remained silent. \"Hmm?\" Henry now averted his gaze and stared down at the floor. Maggie sighed. \"Now he's after the rest of his family. And it's all down to you to stop him?\" It was impossible for Henry to ignore the sarcasm in her voice. He now turned and began walking toward the hallway. Maggie hurriedly followed and laid a hand on his shoulder. \"You don't think I can help you?\" she asked, her tone now a bit softer. Henry looked up at her, his face grim and determined. He was starting to think no one would believe him. \"First you have to believe me,\" he said. Then he took off down the hall. \"Wait!\" Maggie jogged after him, but it was no use. The last she saw of Henry that day was him crashing through her front door and running outside. \"Dammit!\" Little did Henry know, as he ran down the sidewalk away from Maggie's house, he was being watched. Normally, he would have known this almost instantly, but his mind was preoccupied at the moment. He had only one option left for getting someone to believe him, and it was a long shot at that, but he had little choice now. Henry ran down Main Street as fast as his legs would carry him. He stopped at the bottom of a flight of stone steps and leaned on a nearby railing to catch his breath before resuming his march. He paused just outside the main doors into the police station to let two patrolmen past. They stared at him curiously as he ran inside. The duty officer, a balding man in his late forties, looked up and scowled as Henry approached the reception desk. \"What do you want, kid?\" he asked in a rather gruff voice. Henry placed his hands on the desk. \"I want to report a murder – before it happens.\" At that, the officer stood up from behind the desk, seized Henry by the arm, and began dragging him away. He opened the front doors and showed Henry out. Henry immediately rounded on his heels to protest, but the officer quickly dismissed him with an angry gesture and went back inside. For the longest time, Henry simply stood there, staring at the closed doors, his shoulders slumped in defeat. A/N: Once again, a bit of a short filler chapter, but it also provides better insight into later installments. The title here, Undermined , basically means that all Henry's efforts to get the truth out have now failed, more or less. Side Note: I might as well ask now, so you all have time to think this through. What kind of Good Son story would you like to see me write next? A). A story set in the primary TGS universe. or, B). A continuation for Something About Mark ? PM me with your choice.[Chapter 21] Chapter 21 - Know Your Enemy Once again, that creeping sensation invaded the back of Henry's neck as he trudged down the main drag, head bowed in defeat. He had absolutely no idea of what to do now. Unlike when he'd left Maggie's earlier, Henry knew that someone was following him this time. He took a quick peek over his shoulder, but still, he saw no one there. It was eerie. Nevertheless, he was determined to put a stop to it. After taking yet another peek over his shoulder to make sure the coast was clear, Henry put on a quick burst of speed and ducked into a nearby alleyway. He stood with his back to the wall, ready to ambush his pursuer. He didn't have long to wait. A dark-haired figure emerged into his line of sight, but didn't seem to notice Henry. Good. He swiftly grabbed the person's arm and yanked them into the alley. A surprised squawk issued from their mouth. Henry roughly shoved his pursuer up against the brick wall and pinned him by the shoulders. Surprise, surprise. It was Mark. \"Why were you following me?\" Henry demanded, glaring at his cousin. For the moment, Mark was speechless. That was a first. \"What's the matter?\" Henry quipped in a rather snarky tone. \"Cat got your tongue?\" His cousin blinked at him and raised an eyebrow. \"Or should I say 'dog'?\" Then Mark finally responded. \"Whatever,\" he scoffed. \"You're one to talk. You keep stuttering at my mom and she wonders what's going on with you. Then you start telling lies about me to her, and now to Maggie.\" Henry froze. He knew about him talking with Maggie? How? He'd probably been following him ever since leaving the house earlier. But for now, the how didn't really matter. What did matter was how Henry was going to deal with the problem that literally stood before him, wearing a cocky grin on its' face. \"And d'you know, I thought it was kind of cute, the way you and my mom were cuddling last night,\" Mark said, his tone underlain by a hint of laughter and mockery. Henry simply narrowed his eyes at him. \"Did you now?\" he replied. \"It was also kind of sad, really,\" Mark said, his grin curving into a mournful frown. \"Oh, yeah?\" Henry challenged. \"How?\" \"I mean, she's not your mother, is she?\" Mark taunted. \"It was sort of pathetic if you ask me.\" Henry's face went rigid and he gritted his teeth. Mind games , he reminded himself. That's what he does. So do it to him. Henry put on a smile and spoke with disarming confidence. \"You're wrong about that. The fact of the matter is, she is my mother.\" Mark stared at him, somewhat confused. Then he shook his head before replying. \"Sorry, pal. Your mom's a popsicle, soon to be a maggot's dinner.\" \"Yes, she died. But then maybe she came back, too. She gave me this sign, you know? She chose your mom as a way of coming back. I guess you wouldn't understand that, would you? It's tough for you, maybe, but that's the truth, plain and simple. She's my mother.\" For the moment, Henry could see that his tactic had worked. Mark laughed nervously, put out by his cousin's unexpected confidence. \"Very scientific! No wonder you're seeing a shrink.\" Then Mark quickly regained his own confidence and stared Henry in the eye. \"Makes no diff either way. My mother, your mother, what the hell... We'll both miss her.\" Henry gulped. \"What did you just say?\" he asked. \"Hey! Don't get all upset,\" Mark said, shrugging rather nonchalantly. \"If you try and do anything to Janice, I'll kill you first,\" Henry threatened. He didn't really mean it, but he badly needed a way to intimidate this kid. Mark suddenly shoved Henry backwards and planted a finger in the middle of his chest. \"You're so violent, Henry. So disturbed. You know, they're going to have to put you away, don't you? For the rest of your life.\" Delighted with himself, Mark grinned broadly. \"She's my mom, Mark,\" Henry said with a confident grin of his own. \"That's just the way it is.\" Mark's smile abruptly disappeared, and an uncertain scowl replaced it. Henry quickly edged past him and began walking back toward the street. \"Hey, Henry,\" Mark said, briefly falling into step behind him. \"What?\" Mark's voice was cold and dead serious. \"I can tell when someone's messing with me, and this is one of those times. My advice? Don't. Fair warning if you do, you'll be taking this where you don't want to go. All bets are off.\" Henry simply gave him the most charming smile he could and walked off, leaving Mark on his own in the dark alleyway. Knowing him, it was right where he belonged, too. Roughly halfway back to the house, a convoy of heavy equipment and construction vehicles on flatbeds roared past Henry on the road, heading south, in the direction of the beach. The boy was suddenly reminded of Janice, and Mark's threat against her. He once again set off running. With any luck, he could get back to Janice and keep a close, but discreet eye on her before her son could. Provided he wasn't already too late. When he finally got back, Henry burst in through the front door, anxiously looking around for any signs of his aunt. At the same time, he noticed that strings of small, yet bright, multi-colored light bulbs were hung along the edges of the ceiling in the entryway and that a large, green wreath now graced the inside of the door. They sure cleaned things up fast ... Henry thought. \"Henry?\" He looked out into the living room and saw Janice on the sofa, a laptop sitting in front of her on the coffee table. \"Oh, hi, Janice,\" Henry replied. \"Sorry about running out like that earlier. I was helping Maggie clean up at her place.\" Janice smiled at him. \"That was very nice of you.\" \"What's with the lights?\" he asked rather abruptly. His aunt laughed. \"At this time of year? What do you think, silly? Christmas is only four days off.\" Wow ... With all that had been going on in the past week or so, Henry had completely forgotten about Christmas. Now that he thought about it, Alan had brought it up the night of the sleepover. And, his father had been meaning to give him the touchphone for Christmas as well, but with the trip and all, there was still a very real chance that he wouldn't be back in time. \"Come on in here,\" Janice said, waving to Henry. Henry cautiously entered the living room and was left gaping in wonder. Sitting in a gap between the piano and the sofa was a tall, well-lit, and partly-decorated Christmas tree. A real one, too. The scent of fresh pine filled the air here and brought back the many happy memories of years' past. For a time, Henry was lost in thought. At long last, a break. A break from the constant running and counter-scheming of the past few days. But inevitably, his thoughts wandered back to his mother, which somehow led him back to the current situation. Then he got it in his mind to do something else. Henry abruptly turned on his heels and went upstairs to Mark's room. Fortunately, its owner was nowhere in sight. He scanned the room, searching for some clue as to his cousin's latest intention, or some sign of mischief. Unfortunately, there was nothing out of the ordinary. Henry began rummaging around in his duffel bag for something. Then he noticed one of his shirts lying on the floor near Mark's bunk. Strange. He could've sworn that one was clean. Henry picked it up and sniffed at it. He wrinkled his nose and frowned slightly at the odd smell that met his nostrils. For now, he set the shirt aside and continued searching through his duffel until he finally found what he was looking for: The wooden figure he had carved for his mother. Henry stared hard into its' eyes, as if expecting it to look back. \"This time, help me,\" he whispered. With that, Henry clambered up the ladder to his bunk and carefully concealed the statue beneath his pillow. Normally, he wouldn't have placed his faith in luck and wishful thinking, but right now, it was all he had. No one in any position of authority believed him. He wasn't even certain if his own father did, either. Janice had obviously made up her mind, and Maggie was probably going the same way now, too. The police probably thought he was crazy, while Jack was a wild card. Henry didn't know his uncle's standing on the matter, but it likely wasn't a helpful one. While they didn't know the whole truth of the matter, Henry knew that Connie and Chloe were on his side. Neither of them fully trusted Mark, which was enough. Then there was Alan. At the very least, he had suspicions about Mark, and would probably come to the same conclusions that Henry had sooner or later. And as for Richard... At the moment, Henry had no idea of where his little brother's true loyalties were. Of course, this whole matter was probably terribly conflicting for Richard, who was used to seeing things in a much more simple light. To him, it had all been black and white, and now, he was seeing gray for the first time. Even Henry, who was at the forefront of it all, was at a loss, and just as confused as anyone else. Things would, however, become clear in time. That evening, just before dinner, Henry took his phone out into the backyard. He had decided to call his father. Maybe, just maybe, there was still hope. He dialed the cell number his father had entered into his contact list. Strange beeps sounded in his ear for the longest time. Henry was just about to give up when a groggy male voice answered. \"Hello?\" It was his father! \"Dad! It's me – it's Henry.\" Wallace's voice cleared dramatically in those few seconds. \"Henry?\" \"Look, I'm sorry I woke you, Dad, but I needed to tell you the truth,\" Henry said. In spite of the loud crashing from the nearby ocean, Henry kept his voice down. \"Is this the same 'truth' you tried to tell Janice the other day?\" Wallace asked, now sounding slightly irritated. Henry drew in a deep breath. \"She thinks I'm crazy, Dad. But what I said about Mark is the truth. He's not what everyone around here thinks. He wants to destroy things – he's evil.\" \"Evil's a big word, son,\" Wallace replied. \"Tell me something that he's done, in your own words.\" \"You may or may not have heard, but there was a really big accident on a bridge just outside of town a few days ago. It was caused by an explosion – an explosion that Mark set off on purpose.\" \"What exactly did he do, then?\" Wallace asked, his tone now rather grim. Henry spoke quickly, and in a low voice. \"Mark had this mini-drone – one of those quadrotors. He put some kind of jar on it. I'm guessing that whatever was in the jar set off the explosion. Now the FBI is investigating it as an act of militia terrorism!\" Wallace sighed. \"Those are some serious accusations there, Henry. You'd better be certain.\" Henry nodded ever so slightly, even though his father wasn't there. \"I am.\" For a few moments, the line was silent. \"Dad?\" \"Yes, Henry?\" Now for the hundred-thousand dollar question. \"Do you believe me?\" The silence on the line was answer enough for Henry. But the boy persisted. \"When have I ever lied to you, Dad? Ever? You know me.\" Surely that got his father thinking. He knew very well that his own son had never lied to him. But instead of answering, Wallace said, \"Just hang in there for a little while longer, okay, buddy? I'll be back as soon as I can.\" Just then, Janice leaned out the back door and called his name. \"Henry!\" \"I've got to go now, Dad. Just promise me you'll hurry back.\" \"I promise, Henry,\" Wallace said. \"I miss you,\" Henry said. \"Rich and Connie miss you, too.\" \"So do I, Henry. Give everyone my best. I love you.\" Henry swallowed back his emotions. \"I love you, too Dad.\" They both said goodbye and hung up. Henry could tell that his father wasn't entirely certain whether to believe him or not. But just like Mark with Jack and Janice, wouldn't Wallace choose to believe the word of his own son over someone else? Footsteps moved stealthily across the ground, picking their way through the dark surrounding their owner. The faintest of clicks sounded as the homemade key turned and opened the padlock that held a chain-link gate in place. Seconds later, yet another homemade key was inserted into the lock of a door that stood mere feet beyond the gate. That door swung inward on creaking hinges, exposing a near-impenetrable darkness beyond. Obviously prepared, a hand extended a flashlight inside, revealing the contents as heavy-duty technical equipment. That hand set the flashlight aside, reached to the top of a shelf, and pulled down a roll of thin electrical cable. It was soon followed by a heavy wooden box, whose lid was quickly pried open The flashlight now illuminated an evil, gleaming grin that could've lit up the building all on its' own. Outside, the roll of cable was unwound over a long stretch, then cut and partially buried. At the base of a cliff, a pair of hands labored to complete their task. Loose rocks were overturned and replaced, and crevices in the cliff face were judged and selected one-by-one until the entire work was finally complete. A satisfied sigh of relief was barely audible over the sound of the nearby waves crashing against the shore. Whatever had just been done would serve its' purpose. A thief would be put to justice, and his treasure would either be reclaimed for its' true owner, or destroyed forever. Thunder rumbled and lightning flashed in the distance. A storm was coming. A/N: Another shorter than normal chapter, but don't worry - the next ought to be well above-average. Henry has finally gotten to Mark, and Mark doesn't like it. Not one bit. If you've read up to this point, please don't forget to make your decision on what kind of Good Son story I should write next. Either something set in the regular TGS universe, or a sequel to the current story. Up next: Chapter 22 - ' You Don't Know... '. Tensions finally boil over, and the groundwork for the final confrontation is laid.[Chapter 22] Chapter 22 - You Don't Know... Sheets of rain pounded with an unabated fury against the roof and the windows of the house, while the wind drove it even harder into the ground, turning every inch of dirt into mud. Somewhere out in the woods, a tree toppled to the ground with a great crash, but that wasn't what suddenly jolted Henry from his sleep. Neither was it the massive thunderclap that shook the windowpanes. It was the feeling of something amiss. Henry sat up in his bunk and looked around the darkened room with rising apprehension. Just like earlier, nothing seemed out of place, but then again, he couldn't really see, either. There was also something missing. That was a feeling of oppression. Normally, Henry would have been relieved to be rid of this feeling, but right now, it was anything but good. He leaned out over the rail and looked down into Mark's bunk. It was empty. Henry suddenly felt sick to his stomach. One thing was certain. That boy was up to no good. Henry slipped down from his bunk as quietly as possible and went out into the hall. He looked either way, but saw no one. Muted orange rays from the faraway streetlights provided the sole illumination in the house at present. Streaks of rain also dulled and refracted the light, helping to further distort the already eerie shadows that seemed to waver and dance about on the walls like ghostly apparitions. Henry felt a twitch of genuine fear at the darkness that surrounded him. Swallowing his fear, he decided to check on the rest of the family first. As he walked down the hall, the shadows seemed to follow him. Henry barely kept his fight or flight response in check. Now he began to wish he were back in bed, but he knew he'd never sleep properly, not with Mark on the loose. He peered through a slight crack in the door to Richard's room. Fortunately, the little boy was sound asleep, and nothing in this room seemed out of place. Henry breathed a small, quiet sigh of relief and fully closed the door. Next, he went to Jack and Janice's room. Henry stood just outside for a moment and listened. Nothing. He cautiously and quietly opened the door. It was pitch black inside, but a quick flash of lightning showed Henry the sleeping forms of his aunt and uncle beneath the covers. Janice breathed in a relatively quiet, steady rhythm, while Jack snored like a hibernating bear. Henry quickly felt reassured that nothing was amiss in here, either. Last, but not least, he moved on to Chloe's room. Janice had brought her back that afternoon and she'd quickly returned to her old, little girl-self, playing and laughing with Connie and Richard and fighting with Mark as if the awful trauma of two days before had been forgotten. Both girls lay peacefully curled up in their beds, and were fast asleep. If not in anyone's room, just where was Mark? Heaven only knew what that kid could do unseen and on the loose. The thought alone was enough to send chills up Henry's spine. Just as he was closing the door to the girls' room, he heard a slight squealing noise. He went to the landing at the top of the steps and listened. For a time, Henry heard nothing but the noises of the storm: the hissing of rain against the ground, and the loud booms of thunder that shook the air. Then he heard that strange squealing noise again and instantly recognized it. It was the sound of metal against metal. And it was coming from outside. Henry started down the stairs and stopped at the bottom landing. He was surprised to see the front door partly open, held in position by what he assumed was a cinder block. Wind whistled through the gap, while Henry could see a trail of rainwater on the floor that was rapidly coalescing into a puddle, which, every few seconds, grew as another burst of rain would fly in. Dodging the ever-expanding pool of water, Henry threw on his old tennis shoes and raced through the door without abandon. He barely remembered to close it in his wake, and completely forgot his poncho in the process. He was almost instantly reminded, as his pajamas were drenched within seconds and the rain drove hard into his face, very nearly blinding him. Henry blinked rapidly to clear his eyes and set off through the darkened yard, his shoes sinking a half-inch into the muck beneath as he went. With each staggering, hunched step, Henry began to wish more and more that he'd never gotten out of bed. As he rounded the side of the house, a wide beam of sickly yellow light came into view, and illuminated in it was a figure dressed in a hooded rain poncho and squatting behind a set of bushes and potted plants. Henry couldn't make out the person's face, but he knew who it was. Mark. But what he was doing remained a mystery until Henry got closer, and, with stunned horror, he realized what it was. Mark was kneeled before the dull green-painted gas meter that stuck out the side of the house and ran deep into the ground below. He had a wrench in hand and was doing something to one of the main pipelines. Oh, God! Henry thought. What was he going to do? Funnel the gas inside and kill everyone in their sleep? \"What do you think you're doing?!\" Henry shouted into the din. Mark looked over and grinned fiendishly as he continued to work the wrench back and forth on one of the giant steel nuts that held two of the narrow pipes together. A flash of lightning further enhanced the boy's sinister features. \" NO! \" Henry cried out. He ran forward and tackled Mark like a linebacker. The wrench abruptly flew from Mark's hands and disappeared into the nearby bushes. Both boys tumbled into the mud and slid a fair distance from the side of the house before stopping. \"What do you think you were trying to do?!\" Henry yelled angrily into the wind as they stood to their feet. \"Me?! What do you think?\" Mark asked with faked innocence. \"Oh, I get it: you think I was going to do something to the gas line, don't you?\" \"Weren't you?!\" Henry asked. A blinding flash and earsplitting thunderclap very close by left Henry's ears ringing and drowned out Mark's response. \"What did you say?!\" Henry shouted. \"I said, 'Do you really think I'd do something like that?'\" Mark asked, his voice laced with menacing sarcasm. Henry did. \"Yes,\" he replied in a surprisingly quiet voice as the wind briefly died down. \"Fine, then.\" Mark suddenly shoved Henry back into the mud and kicked some into his face. Then he proceeded back over to the gas meter, where he had already pulled out another wrench and resumed his work. Henry scrambled up and half-walked, half-slid over to Mark and attempted to seize him by the arm. But this time, Mark was ready for him. The boy turned on his heels faster than Henry could have thought and punched him in the right eye, temporarily blinding him. Henry grunted and staggered with the force of the blow, but he still managed to grab Mark by the shoulder and yank him backwards. With a loud yelp, Mark toppled off his feet and fell flat into the mud. Now he just looked plain angry. Mark leapt back up and angrily swung at him again, but Henry ducked the wild blow and landed a right cross in his cousin's left eye. Now they had matching bruises. How on earth would he explain to Jack and Janice how both of them had nearly identical black eyes? But Mark wasn't content with evening the score. He wanted to win, no matter what. With that, he suddenly put Henry in a headlock and began dragging him in the direction of the patio, knocking over a row of the potted plants with a loud crash in the process. Henry gagged and gasped for breath, and clawed at his cousin's arm to no avail. Once they got to the back, Mark slammed Henry into the house with enough force to stun him, and promptly gave him an uppercut to the nose. It connected with a sickening crunch and Henry howled in pain. He collapsed to the ground, clutching his nose as blood began to ooze out and mix with the rainwater. Sparks flashed in front of his eyes – he was seeing stars. Mark grinned down at Henry triumphantly. Henry took that split-second opportunity and swung his leg in an arc, again taking his cousin's feet out from under him. Mark fell flat on his butt. Hard. \"Got any more tricks up your sleeve?\" Mark asked spitefully, glaring at him in the dim light. Henry responded with a punch to his mouth, splitting Mark's lower lip open. Now he was bleeding, too. Mark spat a trail of muted crimson onto the bricks. It was quickly washed away by the driving rain. \"Not anymore,\" Henry replied, just as the outside light flickered on, briefly blinding both of them. A sleepy-looking Jack stumbled out the back door in a raincoat and boots, while Janice stood at the window, staring out at them, her mouth gaping in disbelief. \"What the hell do you two think you're doing?!\" Jack yelled angrily, examining each of the boys in turn as they rose to their feet. They both had matching black eyes and were caked from head to toe in mud. Henry was clutching a bleeding nose, while Mark's lower lip was split and partly swollen. The biggest difference, however, was that Mark was wearing a hooded poncho over his clothes and Henry was still dressed in just his tennis shoes and now-ruined pajamas. Honestly, Jack was so shocked, he didn't even know what to think. Despite what Henry had said about Mark, there had been surprisingly little tension between them. At least, as far as he and Janice could see. But neither of them would have guessed that it could possibly go this far. Even me and Wallace hardly ever got into a scrap like this when we were kids , Jack thought. Despite being a few years apart, they had gotten along pretty well, for the most part. \"I don't want to know – hell, I don't even care – who threw the first punch,\" Jack said, heading the boys off. \"But you're both in trouble. Get back inside and get cleaned up.\" He pointed toward the door. \" Now ,\" he said sternly. Henry staggered up to the back door and initially struggled to open it, but found it much easier when Janice helped from the inside. He shivered at the sudden blast of cool air and stood in the back of the dining room, water-soaked and muddy pajamas sticking to his skin. Henry was eager to put this whole sordid incident behind him, and to get changed into dry, clean clothes. Though it did feel good to finally put Mark in his proper place. And for once, the kid wasn't completely innocent, either. They were both in the same position and equally shared blame. Henry would gladly accept a shared punishment of any kind, just so long as Mark didn't shirk his half of it. \"What happened out there?\" Janice asked as Henry slipped out of his mud-caked shoes. \"And why?\" Henry mulled it over for a moment, but opted against telling his aunt. She'd just tell him he was crazy. \"I'd tell you, but you won't believe me. So what's the use?\" Henry said, a hint of anger in his voice as he stalked away. Janice bit her lip. Despite his seeming forgiveness the other night, Henry probably still harbored some anger from her hitting him. Maybe she'd been a little too hard on him initially. But it simply wasn't his place to talk about Mark like he had, accusing her own son of such terrible deeds. \"Dad...\" she heard Mark whine as they came inside. \"You think you can work your way out of this one?\" Jack said. \"Forget it, pal. Like I said, I don't care who started it. But the fact is, you're in trouble here, mister. For God's sake, just look what you did to Henry. You could have broken his nose.\" Mark put on his best apologetic face. \"I'm sorry, Dad. But Henry...\" Jack held up his hand. \"Don't.\" He shut the door behind them and pointed toward the entryway. \"Go upstairs and get into some dry clothes.\" \"Do I have to sleep in the same room as him? He scares me now,\" Mark said, his tone frightened. Jack's anger wavered and he glanced at Janice questioningly. \"I'll go and check on Henry,\" Janice said. \"Where will we put him up?\" Jack asked her. Janice rubbed her eyes. \"The room down the hall from Chloe's,\" she replied, barely stifling a yawn. Jack nodded and gave Mark a gentle nudge toward the stairs. The boy followed Janice into the entryway and up the stairs, massaging his jaw. Just as they reached the top, Henry was coming out of the bathroom, now wearing dark sweatpants and a white t-shirt emblazoned with the logo of the Falmouth Atlantics, an NAHL hockey team from Maine. He glared at Mark as he slumped down onto the carpet. \"Go get changed into some clean clothes, Mark,\" Janice said, laying a hand on her son's shoulder. Mark warmly smiled up at her and went into his room after grabbing a towel from the linen closet. Janice bent down in front of Henry to inspect his injuries. The crimson flow from his nose seemed to have stopped, but everything from his hair down to his chin was covered in either dried blood or dirt. She went into the bathroom and wet a warm washcloth under the sink to wipe it all from his face. He tried to shrug her off, but Janice cupped his face in her hands and looked him in the eyes as she dabbed the blood and dirt away with the cloth. \"What happened out there?\" Henry scoffed. \"Like I said. Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me.\" A sigh escaped Janice's lips. \"Please, Henry,\" she begged. \"Just tell me.\" Now it was Henry's turn to sigh and he hesitated for several long seconds before finally letting out the answer. He didn't have anything to lose at this point. \"He was doing something to the gas meter. He was trying to kill all of us.\" His aunt's face abruptly fell. She looked sick at heart. \"Oh, Henry... Why – why would you say that?\" She didn't understand. No one did. And again, he wasn't certain that his own father believed him, either. In any case, for now, Henry was more or less alone in this. As soon as Mark was done changing, he came out into the hall for Janice to check his injuries, too. Henry took that opportunity to get his things from Mark's room, including the statue from under his pillow. Janice looked surprised. She hadn't told him anything about moving for the night. \"Henry?\" A few minutes later he emerged into the hall, a pillow, sheet, and blanket under one arm, and a pair of bags in his free hand. With one last glance at Janice, Henry disappeared around the corner. Odd. Like he already knew where he was going. \"What did he say?\" Mark asked, sounding curious. Janice didn't know whether or not she should tell him. After all, she didn't want to add any more fuel to what already seemed a raging fire. December 21 The next morning, after patching up the boys' injuries, Jack and Janice decided to visit Maggie and get her opinion on the matter. As they sat on the old sofa in her office, Janice barely suppressed a yawn before voicing her thoughts about Henry's behavior. \"I know he and his siblings all miss their mother. I know that Henry's suffering, Maggie, but what he's doing simply doesn't make any sense to me.\" Maggie kept her voice calm as she sipped from a mug of tea. \"He's found security in a second mother. Why should he lose her again? And why shouldn't it all be his fault, just like last time? He sees himself as the only one who can keep you alive, Janice. It's a very powerful fantasy.\" \"But he has these crazy ideas about Mark,\" Jack said. \"That's where it hurts.\" \"I know, it's difficult,\" Maggie replied. \"There's a lot of anger in a child who loses a parent – most of it directed against his or herself. Perhaps Henry sees Mark as another version of himself, an alter ego, if you will. All of these wild accusations allow Henry to express hostility which is really meant for his own self. Mark is Henry's safety valve: everything he fears and hates he puts on Mark's shoulders. But none of this is good for Henry's siblings. They're both probably finding themselves trapped in the middle of all this.\" Janice frowned slightly. \"It all sounds too theoretical. It doesn't feel true and it just doesn't add up.\" \"Then what are we going to do?\" Jack asked, his voice exasperated. \"The boys damn near tore each other apart last night.\" \"By all means, don't go telling Henry that he's crazy,\" Maggie said. \"Be loving. Encourage him, take him seriously. Listen to him and see what you can find out. For the moment, that's all I can really suggest.\" Jack and Janice exchanged uncertain glances. They didn't hold out much hope. Determined to follow Maggie's advice, Jack brought Henry into his study for a quiet chat. But Henry was getting agitated, anxious and uneasy at leaving Janice alone in the kitchen with Mark. As subtly as possible, he started edging toward the door. \"I really ought to go now,\" he said. Jack quickly took notice of his nephew's efforts to sneak off and guided Henry into a chair. \"Henry, sit down right here. Janice is in the kitchen. No one's going to do her any harm out there.\" \"You don't know that,\" Henry weakly protested as Jack sat in the chair next to him. \"Okay, fella, let's try and think this through, all right? You thought he was trying to gas us or blow up the house. Obviously neither of those things happened. So what next? How does a twelve year old kill an adult, or anyone, for that matter, and get away with it?\" \"He doesn't think like that,\" Henry said. \"He doesn't care what happens. He just does what he wants.\" Once again, Jack was forced to gently restrain the boy and prevent him from leaving. \"Take it easy there. Let's keep talking, see if we can get one step ahead of all this...\" Mark was sitting at the kitchen table, cleaning something with a dark, oily rag. Richard sat on a stool at the island, watching with distracted interest, while Janice stood over by the sink, cleaning the dishes from that morning's breakfast. \"They've announced that they're going to start the demolition day after tomorrow,\" she was saying, her voice sad. Mark scoffed ever so slightly. \"Yeah, I know. It's gonna be great...\" At seeing how distraught his mother was, Mark softened his tone. \"Hey mom?\" Janice looked over at him. \"What, Mark?\" \"Do you want to come down there with me, tomorrow? For one last time, and maybe we can bring Henry along?\" His mother smiled at him and nodded her head. \"Sure, I 'd like that...\" Just then, she noticed what her son was cleaning out on the table. It was his bolt-shooting contraption, only she didn't know that. And, it was loaded. \"Honey, what is that thing?\" she asked. Mark looked up at her, appearing somewhat confused for a split second. \"Oh, this? It's a kind of catapult that Henry invented. I said that I'd clean it for him.\" \"How are you two getting along? Especially after last night?\" \"Not very well at all, I guess,\" Mark said. \"He's kind of disturbed. I've tried to help him, but... we definitely don't talk as much as we used to. Hardly at all, in fact.\" \"Why is that do you think?\" Janice asked, turning back to the sink. Mark suddenly let out a deep sigh. \"Do you know what, Mom?\" \"What?\" Her son suddenly pulled a chrome ratchet from his jeans' pocket and began pulling the heavy springs backward with it. Janice paid the sound no attention whatsoever. \"I sometimes get the feeling that Henry doesn't like me,\" Mark said in a seemingly disappointed voice. Janice turned from the sink and Mark paused his work with the ratchet. \"Whyever not?\" she asked, sounding deeply concerned. Mark shrugged cluelessly and turned the ratchet another click. Back in Jack's office, his conversation with Henry was progressing at a rather tedious pace. \"Let's just take it all step by step,\" Jack said. \"Let's put ourselves in Mark's position –\" Henry shook his head, frustrated. \"You don't understand! He isn't like us!\" His uncle resisted the urge to sigh. \"I'm trying to help you, Henry. I'm gonna keep on going 'till I've seen this thing through with you –\" \"But you can't because you don't believe me,\" Henry interrupted. \"If you did, we wouldn't be sitting here.\" The kid was perceptive. Jack had to give him that much. \"He's sort of distant,\" Mark was saying as he continued to wind the ratchet back and forth. \"Almost as if he's mad at me for some reason... and sometimes, I think he blames me for what happened to Chloe.\" \"You did everything that was humanly possible,\" Janice said reassuringly. \"Yeah, well, maybe I'm just imagining things...\" The device's springs were now wound back to their fullest extent, and Mark set the ratchet aside, his finger resting absently on the release pin. \"You know how it is,\" Mark continued, \"when you worry about something, you get it all blown out of proportion...\" \"Okay, Henry. I'll be straight with you,\" Jack said. \"There's been too much tiptoeing around this. I don't believe you. Janice doesn't believe you, and neither does Maggie. No one believes you. It's a complete fantasy, Henry. Has it occurred to you to wonder why Mark didn't try to 'eliminate' all of us before you came along? And...\" Jack suddenly trailed off. The expression on Henry's face – a twitch of fear – was enough to make him pause. \"Henry?\" \"I – I think he...\" Henry stammered. But he didn't know quite what to say. \"Well?\" Jack asked. Henry remained silent, unable to voice his suspicions about Matthew's death. A moment of tense silence hung over them before Jack continued, this time in a far more gentle tone. \"I know this is a hard one to take on at your age, but don't you think that what you've been through might affect how you see things?\" Henry got to his feet and vehemently shook his head. He remembered what his own father had told him before leaving, about grief potentially clouding his judgment, but this was way, way beyond that now. Henry knew beyond a shadow of a doubt who, and what, Mark really was. \"You don't know him! You don't know what he is!\" he cried out. In another instant, Henry ran from the room. It took Jack a split second to register this before following. Henry stopped just inside the kitchen. Mark looked up as he walked in and they briefly caught each other's gaze. Henry saw what was out on the table, and he knew that look – his cousin was daring him. Challenging him. Time seemed to pass in slow motion. Henry dived forward and slammed into the table, knocking it backward. His back screamed in protest. At the same time, Mark hit the release pin on the device. The bolt flew past Janice's face in a blur and shattered the kitchen window. Glass shards dropped into the sink with a crash, while Richard emitted a loud shriek of fear and very nearly fell from his perch at the counter. For the longest moment, a stunned silence hung over the kitchen. Then the sound of footsteps thudding urgently on the floor above. Jack stood in the doorway, while Henry picked himself up off the floor, groaning. Janice was left gaping, trying to find the right words to say. \"Henry, that was a very dangerous thing to do,\" she finally said. \"Mark, goddammit! What the hell were you doing with that thing in here?!\" Jack yelled angrily as Connie and Chloe came running full tilt down the stairs. His son's face was a mask of shock and shame. \"I was just cleaning it for Henry, Dad. I didn't know it was loaded, honest. I'm really sorry.\" For the moment, Henry was speechless. Not an hour later, he was on his phone once again. \"He's going to do it real soon. He's going to kill her. He told me so himself. There isn't much time at all. Please believe me and do something about it – no one else will listen...\" Maggie was on the other end of the line. \"Henry, come on over to my office and we'll talk about it.\" But there was no time for that. Henry spoke in a hushed voice. \"I can't let him out of my sight. Ms. Goldblum, I'm not ill or anything, I promise. So please help me.\" With that, he hung up. Wallace was barely an hour into the flight, and already his nerves were on edge. He couldn't stop thinking about what Henry said Mark had done. He knew his son, and Henry wasn't one to blatantly lie or make things up. As far as he'd known, Mark was a good kid, just like Henry. There wasn't any reason to believe he could do such things. But now there was, and Wallace had to wonder: Why? He had heard of kids doing such things, but that was usually because their parents abused them. Jack and Janice would never do that. Never . So what would make Mark want to kill Chloe? No explanation was readily forthcoming, and he would likely ask himself over and over again for the next seventeen hours. Seventeen hours, Lord willing, and he could finally see his children again. It would be an eternity to Wallace. A/N: Review and opinions, please! What'd you all think? I hope this was a good replacement for the whole refrigerator scene from the film. Another three chapters, and then the epilogue. Almost done! The next chapter, ' Reconciliations ', will be largely a filler, but it will be an important one, as Henry finally gets to the source of Richard's anger towards him. Stay tuned. Side Note: The NAHL, or North American Hockey League, is this world's version of the NHL, while the Falmouth Atlantics are the sole professional sports team in a much larger Maine. The Atlantics are based out of Falmouth, which is basically our world's Portland, ME.[Chapter 23] Chapter 23 - Reconciliations Richard still didn't know what to think about what he'd witnessed earlier. First, his big brother had gotten in a big fight with Mark outside just last night, and they seemed to have hurt each other as well. In the middle of that scary storm no less. Now Henny had a big white bandage on his nose, a black eye that made him look half-raccoon, and a slight bruise around his neck. Though he sported a black eye of his own, Mark's only other visible wound was a scabbed and swollen lower lip. That means Henny tried to fight back, he thought. But Mark had still managed to beat Richard's big brother to a pulp. That wasn't fair at all, and it was mean. Not two hours ago, Mark had been cleaning a big machine on the table in the kitchen, a machine that he'd said Henny had invented. Then Henny had come flying into the room and crashed right into the table. At the same time, the machine had gone off, and somehow broken the window right over the sink. That had been really scary. And he still didn't know why. This house was going crazy. \"Richard!\" Richard's head shot up at the sound of someone calling his name. There was something familiar about that voice. \"Hello?\" he responded. \"Anyone there?\" \"Here...\" the voice said, seeming to echo. Where was it coming from? The stairs! Richard bolted from his room and stood on the top landing. \"What are you waiting for, sillyhead?\" the voice called out. There was a playful lilt to it now. Richard's heart thudded in his chest. Only one person had ever called him 'sillyhead'. He ran down the stairs as fast as his little legs would carry him and skidded right into the kitchen. Only this wasn't his aunt and uncle's kitchen. His surroundings had suddenly transformed, and he was back in his own house. And, standing in front of the stove, making pancakes on a griddle, was his mother. She was back! \"Mommy!\" Richard cried out and ran toward her. His mother turned and smiled at him warmly. He hugged her leg and held on for dear life. Susan chuckled. \"Are you all right, sweetie?\" \"I missed you so much!\" Richard sobbed. \"Don't go away again!\" His mother gave him a curious look. \"Where would I have gone?\" she asked. \"I – I thought you d-died!\" Susan ushered him over to the table and sat beside him, wrapping an arm around his shoulders. \"It was just a bad nightmare, baby. Nothing more.\" But Richard continued to babble. \"Daddy had to go s-somewhere faraway. We had to stay at Uncle Jack's place... and Henny... Henny had some trouble with Cousin Mark... Mark was really, really mean and nasty. He got me to turn on Henny... I should not've, but I – I was so mad at him... and now I d-don't know why!\" He buried his face in his mother's shoulder and cried until he just couldn't cry anymore. Then Susan gently pulled him away and looked directly into his eyes. \"I know you're scared, Rich,\" she said. \"And believe me, I understand.\" \"You do?\" Susan nodded. \"And there's nothing to be ashamed of. When we fear something, we can forget what really matters. Who really matters.\" Richard screwed up his face in confusion. \"What's 'dat supposed to mean?\" \"You were afraid that your big brother wasn't telling the whole truth, and that gave Mark an opportunity to plant a seed of doubt in your heart.\" \"What?\" \"Trust Henry,\" his mother said. \"He loves you, and he knows what's best for you. No matter what, he will always love you. Always...\" Richard suddenly felt a twinge of recognition and fear. She had said something similar the last time he'd ever seen her. \"Mommy?\" Susan gave him a sad smile, and then began to fade into the background. \"I love you, Richard...\" she said. Richard lunged forward, trying to reach for his mother's hand, but in that moment, she vanished into thin air. \" NO! \" he screamed at the top of his lungs. Then his surroundings began to blur and twist in on themselves. Richard threw his arms up over his head and cried out in mortal terror. \"Richard, wake up!\" Richard pried his eyes open, and found Henny sitting in front of him, a scared look on his face. He was confused for a split second, and now realized what he had just gone through was the dream. This, unfortunately, was real. \"You all right, buddy?\" Henny asked. \"I heard you screaming in your sleep.\" Richard blinked a few times, and then threw himself into his brother's arms. \"I'm so sorry, Henny!\" he cried. Henry was suddenly confused. \"What are you sorry for, Rich?\" he asked. \"M-Mark... He told me you lied. S-Said that Daddy was never comin' back, and that he left us forever!\" Henry shook his head sadly. \"Why?\" he asked. \"Why'd you believe him?\" \"I don't know!\" Richard wailed, his sobs now coming every few seconds. Very shortly they turned into loud, choked hiccups. Henry hugged him close and gently rocked back and forth. \"I should not've given up on you, Henny. I know you love me, just like Mommy and Daddy. You are my big brother. You keep me safe.\" Henry blinked back a sudden rush of tears and emotion at hearing this. It touched his heart. \"Thank you, Rich...\" Henry's voice was choked and trembled slightly. \"I was starting to doubt if I was really being a good brother at all...\" At that, Richard suddenly burst into a fresh round of sobbing. Now it was Henry's turn to start crying. He hugged his little brother tight. \"Oh, Rich...\" For the next few minutes, they sat there on Richard's bed, hugging and crying, finally letting out all of the pent-up emotions from the past few weeks. \"I miss Mommy so much...\" Richard sobbed. Henry gulped and nodded. \"Me too, Rich. Me too.\" \"Henry? Richard?\" They both looked up with red, streaked faces and saw Connie standing at the door along with Janice and Chloe. \"What is it?\" Henry asked, hastily rubbing the tears from his eyes. \"Are you okay?\" Janice asked. Henry nodded and smiled, hugging Richard in close to him. \"It is now,\" he said, swallowing back a fresh round of tears. Just as he said this, he caught sight of Mark, standing in the background, his eyes dark, cold, and filled with a mixture of anger and jealousy. But for once, Henry didn't care. He had Richard back, and not even the monster that called himself their cousin could ruin the moment. Richard's mind had somehow worked its' way past and seen through Mark's lies. He was far stronger than Henry could've believed. Mark was fuming. He'd manipulated Richard into turning against Henry, and for a while, it had worked like a charm, with the youngest Evans' hardly even talking to or acknowledging his older brother. It had been a terrific advantage and divided Henry's attention at several critical moments when he could have ruined Mark's plans. But now his scheme had backfired, and somehow driven Richard right into Henry's arms, with a whole lot of tears, to boot. He inwardly scoffed. Tears... For the most part, Mark saw no use for them, except for when they served his purposes. Hell, he didn't actually know how to cry. Half of the tears that came from his eyes were ones from yawning. The rest were totally fake. In any case, he saw crying as a sign of weakness and vulnerability. And right now, Henry was weaker and more open to attack than he'd ever been. But Mark decided to let the moment pass. Henry would get what was coming to him soon enough. Then little Richard would know what loss truly felt like. A/N: Probably the shortest chapter yet, but it's still a very good one, nonetheless. A bit of a tear-jerker, huh? I almost considered merging it with the previous chapter, but I felt that it deserved a chance to stand on it's own. With Chapter 24, Wallace returns, and along with this will come the beginning of the end for Henry's battle with Mark. Only two chapters and the epilogue remain. With any luck, I'll be finished by this time next week. So stick with me. We're almost there... Side Note: General consensus so far is in favor of a regular TGS story, and that's where I'll be heading next. As for which one I should do, I'm currently leaning toward my TGS/Fringe crossover idea, but nothing's definite yet.[Chapter 24] Chapter 24 - Point Of No Return December 22 Henry awoke the next morning with a smile on his face. And with good reason. Just yesterday, he had scored his first real victory by helping undo whatever Mark had done to turn Richard. And he'd spent a second night out of Mark's room. Already he was getting a better sleep, especially without having to immediately worry for his own safety. Henry didn't really hold out too much hope, but maybe, just maybe , today would be different. And in a good way, with any luck. As he ate a breakfast of cold cereal, he noticed that Janice was in somewhat of a strange mood. From what he could deduce on his own, she was subdued, sad even, with an underlying hint of confusion thrown into the mix. \"Are you okay?\" Henry asked. Janice looked up from the mug of coffee in her hands, startled ever so slightly. \"Hmm?\" Henry repeated his question, and his aunt finally nodded. \"Thanks for your concern, Henry, but I'm fine.\" Henry nodded, satisfied with her answer. \"It's just that today is the last day I'll get to see the beach the way it was intended to be,\" Janice continued, \"not the way man has decided it should be.\" \"I'm still a little confused as to how this all went downhill so quickly,\" Henry said. \"So am I. One day we're at the fundraising dinner, the next, we get a call saying that the development is going ahead, despite the fact that most people around here oppose it for one reason or another. But there are, however, a critical few who don't, and that largely includes the senior-most members of the town council. I'd held some hope that we could get things done without their approval... but they're not a group to be trifled with. Hall's had them in his pocket since the beginning.\" \"Who's had them in his pocket?\" Henry asked. His aunt let out a poorly disguised snort of contempt. \"Stanley Hall. He owns the company that's developing the beach. Cares more for money and power than anything else, the stupid son of a –\" She held off finishing the sentence in front of Henry. But he had heard enough swearing from his father and grandfather to know what she would've said next. \"I'm sorry for that,\" Janice apologized. \"Sometimes I just get a little carried away and start rambling for no good reason.\" Henry nodded again, understanding perfectly well where she was coming from. All too often in recent days he'd found himself in the exact same position. \"Anyhow,\" Janice said, \"going out this afternoon will be like saying goodbye to the way things were, and finding a way to accept what they're going to be.\" Henry most certainly knew what that was like. He had said goodbye to his mother those three weeks past, but in that time, he still hadn't become any more confident of accepting her loss. He began to wonder if he ever truly would. \"And, I was hoping you'd come with me, Henry. I'd enjoy the company.\" The boy hadn't shown it, but he was somewhat surprised that Janice was being so nice to him. After all, he'd been accusing her own son – though rightly so – of committing crimes well beyond the purview of a typical twelve year-old. Were he in a similar position, Henry probably would've reacted in the same way. Maybe Janice was more forgiving than he'd given her credit for. In any case, things seemed to have calmed down since yesterday, but it certainly wouldn't hurt to keep an eye on Janice, either. So he accepted her offer. Just then, Richard came bursting into the kitchen, breathless and looking a little unkempt. \"Slow down there, Rich!\" Henry said, laughing. \"The world's not going anywhere without you.\" \"Can you come outside, Henny?\" Richard asked, his voice anxious and excited. \"We got a game of tag going there.\" Henry exchanged a knowing smile with Janice and then nodded to his little brother. \"Sounds like fun,\" Henry replied, taking Richard's hand and silently excusing himself from the table in the process. Richard bounced on his feet like a loose spring the whole time Henry was putting on his shoes. \"C'mon, c'mon!\" As soon as they were outside, Henry could see their sister and Chloe standing out in the middle of the yard, watching them with expectant looks on their faces. Richard looked up at Henry and grinned. Then he jerked his hand out of Henry's grip and tapped his big brother on the arm. \"Henny's it!\" Richard cried out and took off running. In near simultaneous motions, Connie and Chloe began running across the yard and screaming gleefully in mock fear. Wait... What? For a second, Henry stood still, confused. Then he was quick to adopt a huge, goofy grin and promptly joined in the game. He had always played the part of 'it' in tag fairly well, but no matter what, Richard was nigh uncatchable. But here and now, Henry vowed to change that, and to upset the status quo once and for all. At first, he faked a move at Connie, and she squealed as soon as she saw he was onto her. But then he abruptly changed directions and went after Chloe. He chased her in a looping, zig-zag pattern that wound every which way across the yard. On one final zig, instead of continuing into the expected zag, Henry headed straight for Richard. Richard's eyes widened in surprise and he bolted like a frightened rabbit. Henry put on an extra burst of speed and ran for all he was worth, but even then, Richard was just barely out of reach. Darn it. Then he decided to play a different tactic. Henry suddenly fell to the ground and lay flat on his back, still and unmoving. The kids abruptly stopped and stared over at him in uncertain fear. Richard hurriedly trotted over to where Henry lay and kneeled beside him. \"Henny!\" he yelled, urgently shaking his big brother's shoulders. \"Wake up!\" In the space of a split second, Henry's eyes flashed open and he pulled Richard to the ground beside him. He tickled his little brother mercilessly, eliciting a fit of giggles and squeals of delight from the four year-old. \"Gotcha!\" Henry said triumphantly. This was the most fun he'd had in ages. Little did any of them know, Mark was watching from one of the upper windows, staring down at the scene below with growing contempt. Why hadn't they invited him to come out with them? He was still a kid, after all, and, he was only human. Mark clenched a fist, his knuckles turning white. It's almost over , he reminded himself. Let Henry have this small victory . In the next few hours, Mark would have his final victory, and justice would, at long last, be served. Wallace's plane landed in San Francisco just after Henry woke up. The second his feet hit the gangway, he hadn't stopped moving. It was hard not to. He knew he'd feel the jet-lag later, but at the moment, he was running on pure adrenaline, and the thought of seeing his children. Of holding them each in his arms and hugging them tight. He had tried to convince himself otherwise, but the past eleven days had seemed more like eleven years. He never wanted to leave his kids again. Wallace completely bypassed luggage claim and left the terminal. All he had was his briefcase, laptop bag, and a duffel filled with dirty clothes. Thoughts of his days in high-school track surfaced as he made a run for the van. It was just the way he'd left it in long-term parking, a shaft of midmorning sunlight glaring off the windshield. After throwing his bags in the backseat and starting up the engine, Wallace suddenly heard a loud bleep from his phone. He reached into his pocket. The display read: 1 Missed Call & 1 New Voicemail . He listened to the voicemail. The caller was all too familiar. \" Hey, Dad, it's me .\" When had Henry called? \" Look, I don't know if, or even when you'll get this message. I don't know whether or not you're back in-country or still over in Hong Kong . I don't even know if you believe me about Mark . But I believe you . When you make a promise...you keep it, right? \" Of course I do , Wallace wanted to tell him. But it was just a recording. \" And you promised you'd be here. I need you, Dad. Please...come back .\" A click sounded as Henry then hung up. Wallace almost felt like crying. He missed his son so badly. Taking a few seconds to gather his emotions, he rubbed a couple of nascent tears from his eyes before settling into a mood of determination. He would get back to Castel before the afternoon was out, come hell or high water. He gunned the engine and sped out of the parking lot, heading toward the highway as fast as he could. Henry was tired, but happy. With well over an hour outside playing with his siblings and Chloe under his belt, it was time well-spent. After taking a quick shower, he went back into his room to rest for a little while before going on the walk with Janice. But as he lifted his pillow to remove the wooden figure from its' hiding place, what instead greeted him was the sight of his statue, chopped into pieces. And beneath that was a large, plain white booklet covered in dirt stains, labeled simply 'T3687'. Henry stared at the statue in dismay. He quickly put all of the pieces into a pile and tried to fit them back together. But it was no use. They were too badly damaged. He then picked up the booklet and stared at it curiously. The first page inside was covered in various diagrams and words that went way, way over his head. \"Sorry about that,\" a mocking voice said from behind him. Henry turned on his heels to find Mark lounging in the doorway, his face as deadpan and serious as ever. \"But it's for your own good,\" Mark continued. \"I heard you talking to that thing the other day. Not healthy. Not scientific, either.\" Then he took notice of the booklet in Henry's hands. \"I'll take that,\" he said. \"Too technical for you.\" As he handed the booklet over, Henry noticed that Mark was using a t-shirt over his hands to handle it. And the second it was in his possession, Mark made a beeline for his room, with Henry reluctantly following. Once they were there, Mark carefully set the booklet aside – on the top bunk, and shoved the shirt deep under the mattress. Henry walked up to him and laid a hand on his cousin's shoulder. He was getting tired of this, and wanted it to end. Maybe they could reestablish the friendship they'd had at the beginning of all this. \"Mark, I'm not... I'm not trying to take anything away from you,\" he said, his voice imploring. Mark just gave him that broad, charming smile, the one that nearly everyone had fallen for. \"Do you know what they're saying about you?\" Mark asked. \"I've heard them. You lost your mom and you've flipped. You're crazy. Don't you know that you're crazy? Are you so far gone that you can't even feel it?\" Henry drew his hand away from Mark, recoiling. \"You're disgusting,\" he replied with as much contempt as he could muster. But Mark kept on talking. \"You've got it in your head that you're going to lose another mother!\" He scoffed openly. \"Wow! Wouldn't that be sad?!\" At that moment, Henry's temper finally snapped. The katana was lying on the workbench, a closed bottle of polish sitting next to it. Henry seized the sword in one hand, and in the other, he took hold of Mark's shirt. \"I could kill you now,\" Henry threatened, holding the edge of the sword against his cousin's throat. To Henry's surprise, Mark offered absolutely no resistance. Instead he smiled and tilted his head back, pointing to the most vulnerable part of his throat. \"Come on then, put it right there, right where my finger is. You might have to push a bit, though. The blood'll go right across the room. You'll love it. Go on, go on!\" Henry stared at his cousin in growing horror. The sword trembled in his hand. It was as if Mark wanted Henry to kill him. Mark's voice was oily with contempt, and he laughed. \"Ha, ha. You're gonna have to do better than that,\" he said. Just then, Janice called up the stairs. \"Mark! Henry! You both ready to go?\" she asked. Henry let the sword drop back onto the workbench with a clatter and stared at Mark, bewildered. But like usual, Mark just seemed to go with the flow. \"We're going to the beach now. Coming?\" Not ten minutes later, Jack heard a loud knocking on the front door and left his study to answer it. There was no way Janice and Mark were back from their walk already. And why would they be knocking, unless Janice lost her keys? Jack opened it to find his brother standing there. \"Wallace! We didn't expect you back until tomorrow!\" Wallace shrugged. \"The advantages of being a good businessman, I suppose. That, and I caught an earlier flight.\" \"The kids will be excited to see you,\" Jack said. \"Where are they?\" Wallace asked, surprised that he hadn't already been trampled over by his children. \"Richard's down for a nap upstairs, and Connie's out back making chalk drawings on the patio with Chloe. And Henry went over to Maggie's,\" Jack said. \"Come on in and wait,\" he offered. But Wallace shook his head. \"That's okay. I'll go and pick him up.\" With that, he headed back down the sidewalk to the van. As he stood with his back to the door in the narrow, pastel-green hallway, Wallace watched as Maggie emerged from the gloom off to his right. Wallace looked at her questioningly. \"Where's Henry?\" \"He was due here half an hour ago,\" Maggie replied. \"He phoned this morning and said that he wasn't coming over today.\" \"Why not?\" Wallace asked, confused. \"He thinks that he's...\" She sighed loudly. \"What is it, Maggie?\" \"Look, why don't you step into my office?\" Maggie suggested. \"I need to talk with you.\" A/N: This was a lot faster to write than I expected. With only Chapter 25 and the epilogue left, I'll be releasing them as separate, but simultaneous installments. So the delay might be a bit longer. Watch as the action reaches it's explosive climax, and the struggle of good vs. evil finally ends. Stay tuned. We're nearly there![Chapter 25] A/N: Without further delay, I present to you the true beginning of the end. Enjoy. Chapter 25 - The Beach & The Endgame Janice cast a wistful glance in the direction of the beach as she walked along the shore, with Mark and Henry to either side. \"A year from now,\" she was saying, \"there's going to be burger stalls, dog toilets, surf board rentals...\" \"I love it!\" Mark cracked, a grin on his face. A second later, his mother stumbled on the gravel underfoot. \"Whoa...\" Mark quickly caught hold of Janice's arm to support her. \"Got you,\" he said in a reassuring voice. At that moment, his eyes met Henry's, displaying an invisible air of challenge once again, just like yesterday in the kitchen, before the device had gone off. \"Why don't we head back now?\" Henry suggested. He was deeply troubled. Janice looked surprised. \"Henry!\" she exclaimed. \"Why?\" Henry stumbled over his words, searching for the right answer. \"It's... er... kind of depressing here, and I'm feeling a little winded. Janice, I think we should go back...\" his words trailed off into the wind. His aunt was surprised by the imploring tone in his voice. She looked concerned. \"Henry, are you all right?\" she asked. \"He's not feeling too good,\" Mark taunted. \"You go on back, Henry. We'll see you later.\" Henry shook his head and slowed his pace ever so slightly. \"It's okay. I just...\" \"Well, come on then,\" Janice said. \"We're almost there.\" Wallace was on the verge of losing his temper. \"Listen...\" But Maggie continued to talk over him. \"Henry has placed himself at the center of all this, a fantasy deeply rooted in guilt over his mother's death, which –\" \"No, Maggie. You listen to me. I know nothing about psychology or therapy. I'm a businessman – I know about people, and I sure as hell know about one of my own sons. Henry's been badly shaken up, he's taken a huge loss – our whole family has. And, OK, when I went away, it was another kind of loss. It's been tough for him – for all of us – but he's not crazy. I know it. I know my own son –\" Maggie was calm and authoritative as she once again spoke up and cut Wallace off. \"'I know my own son.' 'Doctor, I know my own child.' Wallace, if you just knew how many parents over the years have sat there in that very same chair and spoke those words with me, and then –\" \"I'm not concerned with other parents here,\" Wallace snapped. \"...and then,\" Maggie continued, \"only very slowly have had to come to terms with the fact that things are not as well with their child as they should be, and that there are things they don't know, or don't want to know. All I'm asking of you is that you listen.\" Wallace raised both hands, palms out. He was willing to listen, but he was not convinced. \"I wouldn't bother telling you or trying to convince you if I wasn't very worried. The power that this fantasy has for Henry is so complete that everything he sees fits. For Henry, everything Mark does is evidence that he's out to destroy his own mother. And only Henry can stop him. This is his reality, Wallace. He doesn't experience a delusion in any way. It's as real to him as anything is to us. It's a paranoid structure, and my real worry is that it could push him toward serious violence. Why just the other night, it had gone so far that they were speaking with their fists in the middle of a rainstorm, for God's sake.\" \"What?!\" Wallace exclaimed. This was this first he'd heard of that . His son had never gotten into a brawl with anyone before. But if he had, there would be a good reason for it, wouldn't there? Maggie nodded. \"He could do serious harm – to Mark, to himself, or even Janice – by a logic that would say he is saving her from Mark.\" By now, Wallace had had just about enough, and he stood abruptly from his chair. \"I don't want to hear any more, and I'm through talking.\" \"Then will you at least let me come with you?\" Maggie asked. Wallace hesitated for a second, and then nodded before turning to leave, with Maggie following closely in his wake. As they reached the neck of rock that let out to the promontory, the boys' pace slowed, letting Janice go on ahead of them. Mark suddenly grabbed Henry by the elbow and pulled him to a stop. \"Worried about her, huh?\" Mark asked in a quiet voice. \"Well then, I'll give you a break. You two go on without me. I want to be by myself.\" Just then, Janice noticed that they weren't following, and she turned to face them. \"Hey, what's up back there?\" she asked. \"Mom, I saw some neat rocks for my collection a little ways on. I'll catch you guys up later,\" Mark said, continuing along the narrow gravel path. Henry, of course, knew that his cousin was up to no good, but for now, he couldn't see any threat. \"Yeah, well, look, wait a minute...\" Janice suddenly linked arms with him and gave her nephew a little smile. \"Come on. We can be together. Just us two. I'd like that.\" Reluctantly, Henry let himself be drawn away by Janice, but he still tried his best to keep an eye on Mark as well, taking a nervous glance over his shoulder every few seconds. Even as they arrived at the tip of the promontory, Henry turned and looked back. Mark was wandering back and forth across the top of the slope, scanning the ground as if he really were looking for special rocks. Janice eased herself to the ground and sat cross-legged, facing the ocean beyond. \"Now, I think the best thing that you can do is just sit here quietly with me. Don't worry about Mark. Don't worry about another thing. Just sit here and watch the waves, and help me say goodbye to this beautiful place.\" \"OK.\" Henry gave in, albeit reluctantly, and sat down beside his aunt. \"I guess we can say that we put up our best fight to save it. Five years ago, we never would have gotten even this far. But the truth is, the tide is slowly turning against these people who want to destroy nature to make money...\" She trailed off as she caught the tense look on Henry's face. \"What is it, Henry?\" \"He's gone. He was right there, over there. He can't have just...\" Janice suppressed a sigh. \"Henry, it doesn't matter where Mark is. He can take care of himself. You've got to calm down. There is nothing that you need to worry about. Just stay here with me. Close your eyes and let all that agitation go. Your father should be back by tomorrow. Everything's just fine.\" With that, she turned from Henry and stared out over the vast blue expanse of the Pacific. Henry took in a deep breath of air in an attempt to calm himself, but he still couldn't help but sneak a quick look over his shoulder. A sudden wave of fear swept over him as he looked down at the beach below, off to their left. Specifically, at the office trailer which was now plastered with brightly-colored signs that warned of high explosives within. The gate to the barbed-wire perimeter fence stood wide open, and worse, there was no sign of Mark. Henry looked back at Janice. Her eyes were half-closed, and she appeared to be lost in thought. Anxious not to disturb her, Henry stood to his feet as quietly as possible, but she was still able to somehow sense his movement. She spoke without turning to him. \"Where are you going?\" she asked. \"I think I'll, uh, go be with Mark for a while,\" Henry said, forcing a sense of calm into his voice as he spoke. \"All right,\" Janice said. Now intent on preserving her own tranquility, she let her nephew go. \"You go on. I'll see you both later.\" Without another word, Henry turned on his heels and jogged up to the very top of the slope. By the time he got to the bottom, nothing had changed. Nothing at all. That is, until he noticed a rough, homemade key sticking out of the padlock on the perimeter fence. The gate creaked in response to a slight breeze off the ocean as Henry drew closer, his dread growing with each step. For the second time that day, Jack opened the front door to Wallace. But this time, he had Maggie with him. \"Back so soon, Wallace?\" he asked. \"And Maggie, this is a surprise!\" \"Have you seen Henry, Jack?\" Wallace asked. Just as Jack was about to respond, two blurs of color came flying down the hall behind him and launched themselves at Wallace, nearly knocking him over in the process. It was Connie and Richard. \"Daddy, Daddy!\" they both cried in unison. Wallace kneeled and hugged his daughter and younger son close. \"We missed you so much!\" Connie exclaimed. \"I missed you, too, baby. Have you seen your big brother recently?\" Connie and Richard both shook their heads. \"Not since 'dis morning,\" Richard replied. Wallace looked back up at his brother. \"Jack?\" \"I could've sworn he was going over to Maggie's today. I know that Janice and Mark had plans to go down to the beach, though.\" Maggie looked over at Wallace, a concerned look on her face. Wallace looked down at his children. \"Kids, get your shoes on.\" Then he turned to Jack. \"Come with us, Jack. We've got to find them.\" With that, Wallace ushered his children out the front door, Maggie following. Jack stood in the entryway for a short time before calling his own daughter. \"Chloe!\" Chloe bounded down the steps, an expectant look on her face. Without a word, Jack led her through the door, locking it behind them as they went. As quietly as possible, Henry crept past the perimeter fence and approached the trailer. Though the door stood wide open, he made for a high window on the far side, hoping to get a better idea of what his cousin was up to before charging in head-first. Mark was crouched down on the floor inside, stripping the insulation from a copper wire before connecting it to the terminal on a magneto blasting detonator. As he came around the front of the trailer to the open door, Henry noticed a black cable, snaking out into the open and disappearing under the sand. In Janice's direction. Even as he stepped inside, his cousin stayed intently focused on the task at hand. But Mark knew that Henry was there, nonetheless, and spoke without turning around. \"Good, I knew you'd come sooner or later. I think you're really going to like what I've got here. There! That ought to do it!\" His work complete, he stood and faced Henry, an unlikely smile of innocence plastered on his face, and dirty, over-sized work gloves on his hands. Standing between them was the plunger device, its' handle drawn up to the fullest extent. It was at that moment that Henry began to fully grasp his cousin's plan. He was incredulous. For the time being, Mark had the power to decide between life and death. \"Mark! What are you doing?\" he asked, taking a step closer to the device. Mark immediately put both hands on the plunger and spoke in a warning tone. \"Uh-uh. No closer. Or up she goes...\" For a brief moment, Mark craned his neck to look out the window. Janice was still sitting on the promontory, not fifty yards off. \"Still dreaming away...\" \"You can't do this.\" Mark unexpectedly nodded. \"You're right. I can't. You're going to do it.\" For a moment, Henry was genuinely confused. \"What? I don't understand. Look, take your hands off that thing...\" \"You really love her, don't you?\" Mark asked. \"She sure cares about you. And Connie. And darling Richard. Not to mention Chloe, and little Matty.\" Henry was so stunned that he could barely get his words out. \"And you. You first...\" Mark scoffed. \"Oh, I'm way down at the bottom of the list. But who cares?\" he said with a laugh. \"She's right at the top of mine!\" Then he visibly tensed, his knuckles turning white on the handle of the plunger. \"Don't try anything...\" he growled. \"Don't be crazy. Mark, you... they'll put you away for years.\" Mark shook his head. \"Nope. Not me, pal. You. You're the crazy one here, remember? You're the seriously disturbed little boy with the weird fantasies, you're the one with traces of explosives all over his clothes at home, and fingerprints on an explosives manual.\" Henry gaped. \"It's my word against yours,\" Mark said, preparing himself to push the plunger. \"And your word is... madness !\" \"Mark, listen to me...\" But Mark ignored him. \"Want to step outside and watch her go up? It's gonna be amazing.\" Then he launched his full weight against the plunger. At the same instant, Henry swiped an empty oil can from the shelf at his elbow and shoved it directly beneath the plunger. The handle crunched down on the can, blocked. Henry now threw himself at Mark, aiming to wrestle his cousin away from the device. They quickly went into a clinch, each of them grappling to knock the other to the floor. And then Mark suddenly shoved Henry away before launching a hard blow at his chest. Henry gasped and stumbled backward, his arms flying out, trying to find purchase and prevent himself from falling onto the detonator. He just barely managed to grab hold of the nearby window frame. The handle was inches below the small of his back. But before he could regain his footing, Mark was on him, hands closing tight about Henry's throat, and slowly, inexorably, pushing him closer and closer to the handle of the plunger. Janice still sat at her place up on the cliff, blissfully unaware of the struggle going on nearby. The sun was directly overhead, and she basked in its' warmth while staring down into the ocean. She would miss this view. With each second, Mark shoved him down further and faster, until Henry could feel the handle of the plunger digging into his back. There wasn't much time left now. Henry still desperately gripped the window frame in one hand, all the while trying to lever back Mark's chin with the other. Then, when he realized this was getting him nowhere, he changed tactics. Henry grabbed a fistful of his cousin's hair, pulled his head towards him, and at the same time, lifted his own head to butt Mark hard in the face. Mark shouted in pain and fell back, while Henry rolled away from the plunger. For a few, long seconds, there was a temporary lull in the fighting as each boy caught his breath. As discreetly as possible, Henry reached for the cable, hoping to pull it clear of the terminals on the detonator. At the very same instant, Mark shot out a hand and gripped the handle. Henry now had no choice but to put his hands beneath the handle and push upwards. There was a moment of quiet, trembling strain as each of them pitted brute strength against the other. Then Henry managed to get his knee under the plunger, allowing him to free a hand which he promptly used to throw a hard, vicious punch into the side of Mark's face. Mark fell into a corner, briefly stunned by the blow. Once again, Henry desperately searched for a way to quickly disconnect the cable from the detonator. There was none that he could immediately find. No! There had to be. There just had to be. Henry's head shot up at a sudden rasping noise. Mark was back on his feet, a lighter in hand, the flame burning. In his other hand, to Henry's horror, was a stick of dynamite, with a long coil of fuse stuck in one end. And it was lit. \"Now,\" Mark said, \"get out. Before it goes up.\" For a second, Henry stood rooted to the spot, thoughts racing through his head at breakneck speed. The temptation to follow Mark's advice and get out of harm's way was powerful. But he knew what he had to do. Instead, Henry launched himself at Mark. They wrestled around on the floor with the fuse dangerously trapped between them, all the while threatening to set fire to their clothes. Henry finally succeeded in separating the fuse from the dynamite, slightly burning his hands in the process. The fuse fell to the floor, still burning. As they once again went into a clinch and grappled for control, the flame from the fuse caught on a pile of oily rags heaped in the corner. Very soon, the growing fire was quickly lapping up and around the walls, engulfing the trailer in clouds of choking, dark gray smoke. Mark was still trying to get to the plunger. Henry used this distraction to seize his cousin by the back of his jacket and drag him from the trailer, an intense wall of shimmering heat washing over both of them and stinging Henry's eyes with acrid, smoky tears. Janice was starting to wonder where the boys were when she turned toward the beach, and saw first smoke pouring from the trailer, and then Henry and her son tumbling down the ramp into the sand, where they began wrestling almost like professional street brawlers. \"Mark! Henry!\" She immediately jumped to her feet and began running toward them, a thousand different thoughts racing through her head all at once. As she watched on and raced across the sand, Mark threw a hard blow to Henry's jaw, sending him sprawling onto his back. With that, Mark suddenly ran back into the burning trailer, and out of the corner of her eye, Janice watched, to her horror, as her son launched himself down onto the plunger of a detonator device. In a split second, the promontory erupted with a thundering roar, shattering into a million pieces of jagged rock that showered the entire area in debris. Janice gasped. She had been standing there not a minute ago... \"No... no...\" She ran up just outside the perimeter fence and stopped beside Henry, who was still staggering to his feet. At that same moment, Mark came running out of the trailer with a leering smile on his face, certain that he had just succeeded in killing Janice. But he had a hand up over his eyes to protect them from the billowing smoke, and consequently was not able to see his mother until coming right up to where she and Henry were standing. Unnoticed by them, Wallace, Jack, and Maggie were hurriedly stumbling down the slope, while Chloe, Connie, and Richard stood at the top, staring at the scene below in stunned surprise and utter bewilderment. A sudden stillness settled, and Mark was eerily calm. His surprise at finding Janice still alive was replaced by fear. Fear, because she had, at long last, seen through him. The mask had finally fallen away. Janice was struggling to find her words, struggling, even to say her son's name. Her mind was tangled in a set of confusing, equally contradictory emotions. Anger. Terror. Disgust. Maternal love. Shame. \"M-Mark...\" she stuttered. Mark stared back at her wordlessly, with a stunned Henry watching on. With some difficulty, Janice was at last able to put her thoughts into words. \"Why?\" she asked. Her son gave a half-shrug. Such a question was beyond him. Janice stepped closer to him. \"Chloe?\" she reluctantly asked. At the corner of Mark's eye, a tear gathered. Henry had to wonder. Was it actually shame, or was it defeat? Janice swallowed hard, forcing the words out. \"And... M-Matthew?\" Mark gave her a barely perceptible nod of assent and slowly began moving towards her. But her look, one of disgust and bewilderment, warned him off. Then Mark turned to Henry. \"I guess you answered my question: you're the better son. You win.\" He began backing away from them, and it took a split second before Henry realized just what Mark was doing. He was going back into the trailer, which was now almost totally engulfed in flame and smoke. \"Mark, no! Mark!\" Henry cried out. Something was happening inside the trailer, even before Mark reached it. It was glowing at the center. With a loud cry of horror, Janice leapt forward to try and go after her son. \"Janice! It's going up!\" Henry shouted, grabbing at his aunt and pulling her away. Then he dragged both of them to the ground. Just as Mark reached the top of the ramp into the trailer, he stopped, glancing around, and half raised his hand. Then he stepped inside. Maggie nearly fainted, clutching at Wallace in startled horror. And then it happened. The trailer disintegrated in a massive white and orange-red fireball that momentarily silhouetted Mark's form against it before fully engulfing him. A huge column of sand and dirt showered down onto Henry and Janice, followed by bits of shattered wood and twisted metal. Some of the debris flew so far, in fact, that the kids up at the top of the slope had to take cover behind Wallace's van. A huge flock of birds that were settled on the shore suddenly took flight at the deafening shock from the blast. They rose into the air, emitting shrill cries of alarm. And seconds later, a new kind of shrill alarm reached everyone's ears. The sound of emergency sirens, drawing closer. As Henry and Janice finally looked up, they were greeted by a scene of devastation and horror. An enormous, smoking crater was all that remained of the trailer, while the perimeter fence had been twisted and flattened. They were both covered in and surrounded by debris and clouds of dust and smoke. But even as Wallace, Jack, and Maggie rushed over to help them to their feet, and the air finally cleared, one thought remained at the forefront of everyone's mind. Mark was nowhere to be seen... A/N: And so it ends, with a literally explosive conclusion. With his mask gone, Mark could no longer face his mother, and accept what he'd done. At the very least, Janice wasn't faced with a decision on whose life she had to save. To quote Linkin Park, \"...today this ends...\" The epilogue follows. Please, read and review. Guest reviews are more than welcome.[Chapter 26] Epilogue - Truth Hurts Two Weeks Later... January 5, 1994 \"Packing up and going home,\" Henry's father was saying. \"They're in big trouble over the way they stored those explosives.\" Henry nodded as they watched a group of men rolling up a huge wire fence, and another taking down a sign, while an earth-mover was carefully loaded onto a flatbed. Just past him and his father was what remained of the promontory, and the concrete barrier that now blocked it off. \"Janice will be happy,\" Henry replied. \"Mostly.\" \"Eventually, I guess,\" Wallace said. \"Hall's being taken to the cleaners, and now he has to restore the beach to help compensate the town.\" Of course, they both knew that the space below would never truly be the same again. \"Come on – they'll be waiting for us,\" Wallace said, ushering Henry back in the direction of the van, where Connie and Richard waited with the doors open. They were silent. Not ten minutes later, Henry stepped into Mark's room for one final look. It's transformation in the space of two weeks was nothing short of astounding. The walls were bare white and the shelves totally empty and free of even dust, while the bunks had been stripped down and the mattresses wrapped in plastic dust covers. The workbench was empty as well, and was now nothing but bare, rough wood. They were all a hollow shadow of their former selves. Henry looked around, trying his best to understand why. It was all just so overwhelming. He stepped over to the workbench and carefully ran his hands over the surface. Something lodged between the wood and the wall caught his attention, and Henry pried it free with little effort. It was one of the bolts from Mark's crossbow device. Henry studied it for a moment, and without ever really understanding why, he pocketed it. The sound of footsteps drew his attention to the doorway, where Chloe stood, smiling at him. Henry smiled back and opened his arms to embrace her. \"Hey there, you...\" he said, ruffling her hair a bit. Chloe sighed and looked inside the now-empty room. Her voice echoed off the walls inside as she spoke. \"I still don't understand why,\" she said. \"Why did he do it?\" Henry shook his head sadly. \"That's one question no one really has the right answer for, 'Chlo.\" \"Henry!\" a voice called from downstairs. It was Jack. Chloe looked back up at Henry. \"They sent me up here to get you,\" she said, her voice somber. Henry nodded and walked with her down the stairs, right into Jack's huge embrace, which lifted him right off his feet. \"Now you take care of yourself and your sibs, you hear?\" Jack said. \"Careful, honey,\" Janice said with a little laugh. \"You'll break his ribs.\" Once Jack had let Henry back onto the floor, Janice grimly nodded in the direction of the living room. There was one last thing Henry had to do. Sitting in a wheelchair in the middle of the floor with a plaid rug across their lap, bathed in harsh morning sunlight, and looking very small in the large room was Mark, but he looked nothing like the Mark that Henry had once known. His eyes and the entire top of his head were wrapped in layers of white gauze bandages. The skin on his face and hands had been horribly scarred and burned. Just like his room, Mark Jordan Evans was now a hollow shadow of his former self. Henry stood at the far end of the room, silently staring at his cousin for a time. Then he turned and began moving toward the entry. He was hoping to leave now, and not have to speak with Mark. But as fate would have it, Henry's foot collided with one of the end tables, rattling the lamp atop it and drawing Mark's unwanted attention. \"Who's there?\" Mark asked. His voice was raspy and somewhat strained. Henry stopped, but he could not speak. \"Is it Henry?\" \"Yes,\" Henry replied somberly. \"We're leaving now.\" \"Come here first,\" Mark said. \"There's something I want to ask you.\" Reluctantly, Henry turned and stood before Mark. Close, but not too close for comfort. \"Closer, please,\" Mark said, almost as if he could sense Henry's presence. Henry pulled up a chair and complied. As he did so, he noticed that Mark's hands remained lifeless in his lap, and he got his first real look at the truly horrific damage done by the blast. Second and third-degree burns maimed almost every inch of Mark's exposed skin. \"You won,\" Mark said. Henry shook his head, but remained silent, disturbed and appalled. \"You had some luck, but you were good, Henry...\" Mark continued. \"But I'm still alive. Now I'm giving you a chance to finish the job.\" Henry recoiled slightly. \"What are you talking about?\" he asked. \"Down in the basement is some rat poison. I'll take it in a week or two. No one will ever connect it with you...\" Henry shook his head. \"No,\" he said firmly. \"Sorry.\" \"Listen to me...\" Henry whispered his next words. \"Being alive is your poison.\" But those obviously weren't the words Mark wanted to hear. \"Go and get it. Do it now,\" he hissed. For another few seconds, they remained close, face-to-face, then Henry stood from his chair. \"What's good for rats is too good for you,\" he said with as much spite and venom as he could possibly muster. \"Henry, don't go. Please don't.\" Mark was begging now, pleading even. \"I can't live like this...\" Henry paused for a beat before dropping a sheet of heavy paper into Mark's lap. \"What the hell...?\" \"Riddle me that,\" Henry called out over his shoulder as he left the room. Janice and Henry stepped out onto the sunlit front walk, side by side. Henry's siblings and their father sat waiting in the van, with the doors open and electric engine quietly idling. \"Well... now you've said goodbye,\" Janice said, her tone awkward and faltering. Henry nodded. \"He wanted me to get him –\" \"I know,\" his aunt replied. \"Ah...\" a grim look of recognition dawned on Henry's face. \"He asked me, too,\" Janice said. She had to do her utmost to keep her voice under control. It now devolved into a whisper. \"I was very tempted to do something... to end it for him...\" As she took Henry's hands in hers, the feeling of awkwardness was replaced by somber sadness. \"I'm glad you haven't been here these past couple weeks...\" \"Are you?\" Henry asked. His aunt's tone was sad and filled with a reluctant acceptance. \"I'll never forgive him... for what he did to Matthew, and for what he tried to do to Chloe... but he's still mine. He's still my child and I can't stop loving him. Do you understand that?\" \"I think so.\" \"Mark needs us now more than ever, because he's more like a child than ever – completely helpless. The doctors say that he may never use his arms again, and his legs aren't far behind...\" Henry nodded. Janice quickly collected herself and took Henry's hand in hers. \"You know why we have to be apart for a while, don't you, Henry?\" Her nephew nodded again, but hesitantly this time. \"I guess...\" \"You're going to be busy settling into a life of responsibility, and I need time to think about Mark, and try to understand. Then... I guess we'll start fresh, maybe in a new town, a new house. And you'll all come and visit us.\" Henry was staring down at the ground, and biting his lower lip. He was fighting back tears. \"Do you think you'll be all right?\" Janice asked. Henry nodded, and swallowed hard, forcing the tears away. Then he noticed that Janice was wearing her green dress. He touched it lightly. \"It doesn't mean anything really, does it, this dress?\" \"What?\" Janice asked, confused. \"It's not a sign. You're not really her. She's not inside you...\" Janice now looked even more confused than before. \"Henry, I don't...\" Slowly, and with some difficulty, Henry let his words out. \"She's not you... that makes it easier. I can think about Mom now, more... clearly. I feel sort of better. It's not so bad now...\" He was unable to explain himself any further. \"I mean, I think I'm going to be okay.\" At that moment, Janice hugged him tightly. \"Oh, Henry!\" she said, her voice trembling slightly. As they separated from the embrace, Henry looked up to his aunt. \"Will you teach me some music next time I come?\" he asked. Janice nodded, not quite trusting herself to speak at the moment. \"Sure,\" she whispered. Henry smiled. \"Great! I'm gonna try and get in the school band this fall...\" With that, he gave Janice's hand one final squeeze, ran down to the waiting van, and then closed the door behind him. He waved as the van pulled away. Janice raised a hand, as did Jack and Chloe, both of whom were standing in the open front door. Unbeknownst to anyone, Mark had used a foot to get his wheelchair over to one of the living room windows. With some painful effort, he raised one of the hands that no one thought he could use and waved as well. Janice was touched by Henry's surprising optimism. As she turned to go back to the house, she saw her son at the window, raising a hand to wave goodbye. She was startled. He shouldn't have been able to do that. The doctors ... Obviously, Mark had been hiding it from them. Then Janice decided that, for now, she'd let her son have his one last secret. The End. A/N: Well, now the final bow has been taken. Were you expecting that? When I first read the 1991 draft, I certainly wasn't. For the time being, it ends here. I'd like to thank all of my faithful readers and reviewers for giving me this opportunity to present the story of TGS in a whole new light. Special thanks to Comedy Monarchy , fear2breathe , and 90TheGeneral09 . For now, I'm going on a bit of a writing break, to help clear my head, and form new ideas for the next story, which, I have decided, will be the TGS/Fringe crossover. It will be titled 'A New Divide'. So, anytime in the next month or two, keep your eyes on the TGS 'crossovers' section. I hope you'll continue to follow that story as well. Thank you all. - phorosz ","Summary":" A/N: I'm certain that I'm not the first person to think of this (e.g., a complete role reversal for"},{"Movie":"Good Son","Title":"TGS: Unfortunate Truth","Author":"fear2breathe","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10163262","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Note: Let's say Henry never died after that fall. Yes, I know what you're thinking, \"Are you crazy? There's no way he could have survived.\" Over the years, I've been drawn to write many fanfics of \"The Good Son\" and they are all scenarios of how I think Henry would be and the twisted things he would do if he had survived. I am aware it would've been impossible, but I enjoy the 'what if' ;) Mark and Henry are in their late 20s here and are the main focus of this one, which is why Susan, Wallace, and Jack are not in it. You'll find out about Connie later. Jennifer Narz, a young brunette woman, 23 years of age, is walking alongside a road one afternoon when Mark Evans, on his way to visit Richard Evans' grave, drives by but then decides to pull over and back up until he reaches her. \"Excuse me miss...\" He began, and Jen paused to see what he needed, \"..I'm a bit lost. I was wondering if you could give me some directions to Raulin Cemetery? I'm supposed to be at a memorial for Richard Evans and I don't want to be late.\" Jen's jaw dropped at the mention of that name, \"Richard..Evans..? How did you know him?\" Mark stared at her for a moment, wondering why this woman suddenly seemed so uneasy, \"Well.. he was my little cousin.. murdered when he was just a baby.\" \"Huh? Murdered..?\" Jen repeated, seeming even more shocked now, \"Wh.. murdered?!\" Noticing her increased anxiety, Mark turned off his truck engine and was ready to assist. He did have a caring heart, after all. \"Yeah.. he had this psycho older brother who drowned him in a bath tub, out of jealousy.\" Mark explained. Jen was very confused and seemed a bit out-of-it now as she stepped back and spoke in a low voice as if talking to herself, but Mark would still hear the name, \"Henry..?\" Mark went wide-eyed at that, \"What?!\" Snapping back to reality suddenly, Jen shook her head, \"N-Nothing. I'm sorry.. I'm not sure how to get to that cemetery.\" Immediately following the last word, she turned and took off running into the forest. \"Hey! Wait!\" Mark shouted, shoving his keys into his pants pocket and got out of the vehicle to chase after her, \"Miss! Stop!\" When Jen had noticed him chasing and gaining on her, she grabbed a branch that lay nearby on the ground. It wasn't too heavy, but still looked like it could do some damage if she needed to defend herself. She spun around to face him as he closed in, \"Who are you, and WHY are you telling lies about Henry Evans?!\" Her voiced was raised in anger and she held the branch up in a threatening manner. Mark froze and raised his hands up in front of him, \"Whoa! Hold on.. nothing I've said is a lie! How did you know Henry..?\" She lowered the branch, but only slightly as she kept her eyes on him, hesitant and out of breath now as she answered, \"I'm...his...girlfriend.\" Mark's eyes widen and jaw drops in shock, \"His girlfriend?! Are you tell me that PSYCHOTIC FUCK is alive?!\" As he begins to step forward toward her once more, Jen panics and swings the branch, striking Mark across the face, \"Stay back!\" Mark stumbled just a bit, now holding one hand over the spot he was hit. \"Calm down, I'd just like to know how he's alive after the fall 15 years ago.\" Jen looked clueless, \"Fall? What are you talking about?\" He sighed, \"So he doesn't talk about the past. No surprise there. Playing more games with people. Okay.. 15 years ago, he had a fall from a cliff. So high up, he should NOT have survived. Listen to me.. you're in a lot of danger with him. He's VERY cold-hearted and a killer! He plays mind games with people and gets off on it.\" There was warning in his tone, as well as concern. Mark did not want someone else to get hurt. Jen lowered the branch again, \"Stop lying. For as long as I've been with him, he's been friendly and kind to me.\" Again, Mark sighed, \"That is what he does.. he tricks people into believing he's innocent and harmless!\" Shaking her head, Jen sighed, \"You need to back off, okay? I'm not going to stand here and listen to someone I don't even know spew lies and slander about my boyfriend. Go away!\" Mark sighed, defeatedly, and nodded, but he wasn't going to give up completely. \"Okay, I'll go back to my truck and let you be on your way, but please... is there a way I can reach you? I'm concerned about your safety.\" \"GET. LOST.\" Jen glared. \"Can I at least know your name?\" Mark added, desperate to get any piece of information. \"Fine! It's Jen. Now PLEASE just GO.\" Mark nodded a small smile on his lips as he turned away and spoke one last time, \"I'm Mark. Just be careful, okay? And on the look-out.\" With that, he headed back to his truck without waiting to see if she'd respond anymore. Once more, Jen sighed and looked so very annoyed as she dropped the branch and headed in the direction she was originally going, toward a cabin she shared with Henry. Only this time, she stayed in the woods as she walked. Mark did glance back and notice this. Perhaps he would drive up the road a little ways and watch from a distance. No way in hell was he going to let someone else get hurt Henry was DANGEROUS. And in the distance, unbeknownst to Mark and Jen, he had been watching.[Chapter 2] After about a half hour of walking, Jen finally made it back to the cabin she was living in. It was small, but a beautiful dark brown color and secluded. Once inside, she closed the door behind her and sighed as Mark's words were now repeating in her mind. But why? Should she really heed a warning from a stranger? Jen shook her head and headed toward the living room, but it was quiet. In fact, there didn't seem to be a single noise anywhere throughout the cabin. \"Henry?\" Jen spoke out, as she headed for the stairs. \"Up here, babe. Come join me.\" His voice would respond from the bedroom upstairs. She smiled and went to meet him, stepping inside the room, but he was nowhere in sight. After a couple more steps in, the door slammed shut behind Jen, causing her to jump a bit and spin around. Henry stepped in the way of the door, meeting her startled expression with his angry one. \"Henry. What's up?\" She asked him, a bit more startled by the look on his face, but she remained as calm as possible. \"Jen…\" Henry began, pausing as he took two steps toward her, \"..that man you were talking to in the woods earlier… his name was Mark, wasn't it?\" For the moment, Jen was speechless, wondering where he was to have witnessed all of that. \"Well, yeah… he kept saying this crap and wouldn't leave me alone.\" Henry nodded, \"I did notice you ready to defend yourself. What did you tell him to make him so insistent on following you though? Did the fact that we're together slip out of your mouth?\" During this, he had stepped forward more and Jen would step back until he now had her backed against a wall, each of his hands up and resting on either side of her. Jen stood silent, confused by this behavior as Mark's warnings again echoed in her head. Could it be possible he had been right? It sure looked like it. Henry did currently scare her. Finally, she nodded in response to his question, \"It did Henry, I'm sor-.\" Before she could finish though, one of Henry's hands had come away from the wall and across Jen's face in a slap. She had winced, her face still turned in shock and she was pretty stunned now. After a moment, she looked back at Henry again, her tone now a whisper and fearful, \"I'm sorry.\" Henry shook his head, his blue eyes glaring angrily into her dark brown ones. \"You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, huh?! I bet you even know about the past too.\" Jen immediately shook her head, \"No… I don't know anything.\" But Henry just grinned, knowing her response was only because she didn't want to get hurt. \"You do. So you know how dangerous I can be. Don't think that because it was so long ago that it's over. It's not…\" He paused to lean his face in closer to hers, \"I won't hesitate to make you next, babe .\" Jen just nodded. Henry glanced out the window as if he was expecting someone, but no one was out there, \"I think we have some time. Undress.\" He commanded, looking back to her again. Jen blinked, staring back at Henry and not knowing what to say. She didn't want to go through with this, but what could she do? He had her trapped here and now…oh no. \"Henry, I…\" She began, but he was quick to cut her off. \" NOW .\" Henry again commanded. The volume and tone made Jen flinch. She nodded as she undid her pants, \"Alright…\" Henry took his hands off the wall so she'd have an easier time undressing, but his gaze never left her. He then stripped himself and shoved Jen onto the bed, quickly pinning her as well. \"Don't we need…\" Jen had began, but Henry cut her off with his mouth against hers, kissing her deep as he then roughly began. Mark had spotted the cabin from afar and parked out of sight before making his way toward the door.[Chapter 3] In Henry's mind, there'd be no danger if Mark did show up. Even if Mark had a gun, he knew that it would not be fired due to the risk of hitting Jen. And yes, his cousin would soon be arriving. Henry knew this, because Jen had a bad habit of never locking the door behind her. A devious grin appeared on Henry's lips. He truly hoped for Mark to show up and see this. Before entering, Mark pulled out a gun from his back pocket and slowly continued inside, making sure to be as quiet as possible. He could hear some noises from up the stairs as he carefully made his way up them, stalkish, like an animal sneaking upon its prey. Extending a hand, he reaches out and grabs the bedroom doorknob, turning it softly to crack the door open and peer inside. His stomach then turned! Not only at the sight of Henry, but at the fact that Jen was in there with him –screwing him- even after Mark had tried to warn her. Shaking his head, Mark felt both disgusted and disappointed. He considered shooting Henry right there, but no, the shot could hit Jen. He pulled the door shut again. Luckily it was silent. With a sigh, Mark made his way back out and decided to come and try another time. He currently needed to clear his head and do some thinking anyway. After some time had passed and Henry was finished, he quietly slipped on his clothes and shoes as Jen sat up on the bed and watched him a bit, also quietly. He only gave her a quick glance of disgust before stepping out of the room and out the back door of the cabin. Jen sighed. Getting up from the bed, she slipped some clothes on and headed for the refrigerator where a bottle of Long Island Iced Tea sat on the top shelf. Her mind was spinning and she felt so out of touch after what had just happened. She needed something. Anything. Grabbing the bottle, she took a couple swigs and exited out the front door, bringing the liquor with her. She headed out into the woods. She didn't care. Every minute or so, she would take another big drink from the bottle and it seemed to start taking effect quickly. After twisting the cap back on, her foot suddenly caught a root and she fell forward to the ground, letting the bottle drop and roll so that she could catch herself on her hands. The liquor bottle was plastic, so it did not shatter. In the distance behind her, Mark was just hanging out. He never completely left, he just wandered around and did some contemplating on what to do. Suddenly, he had heard something. Jen's fall was not too loud, but made just enough noise to catch his attention. When he saw that it was her, he sighed and stared for the moment. Should he confront her? That scene he caught flashed in his mind again, and once more, he felt his stomach turn. But why exactly? Was it really disappointment? Why did it seem to matter so much? Mark took a deep breath. Instead of trying to pick herself back up, Jen crawled along the ground until she was within reach of the bottle. Grabbing it up, she then got to her feet but would stumble backwards a bit. Two hands were there catch her by the arms, but this startled Jen as she feared it to be Henry. Gasping, she jolted forward, spinning to face the person, but also immediately falling onto her butt.[Chapter 4] A sigh of relief escaped Jen's lips when she looked up to see that the person behind her had been Mark, not Henry. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.\" he apologized, reaching a hand out to help her stand up again. Jen paused for a moment before reaching out to take his offered hand and stand back up. Once she was up, Mark's eyes moved to look down at the bottle, \"Why are you wandering around in this drunken stupor?\" \"Fuck you!\" Jen spat back. Sighing, Mark shook his head, \"I guess I thought things were fine and happy with you. I mean… well… according to what I had seen in there.\" \"..what?\" Jen mumbled at first, but Mark had turned his back to her now and began to walk away. \"I'm out of here. Maybe I'll see you again once you've slept everything off.\" There was such annoyance in Mark's voice. He didn't want to deal with some drunk right now. More important matters were present, like figuring out what to do about Henry. Jen was FUMING at the fact that Mark had come into the home and spied on them during what occurred, \"Who the HELL do you think you are?!\" She screamed, whipping the plastic bottle at Mark. It was a successful shot, striking him in the back of his head. He paused in shock. \"WHAT IN THE HELL GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO WALTZ INTO MY HOME AND-.\" Jen had begun yelling at him, but tripped and fell forward to the ground. Displeased with the attack, Mark turned and made his way to her, glaring. Instead of offering a hand this time, he reached down and grabbed her arm and shirt, lifting her up to her feet but then slamming her back against a tree, holding her there. Jen struggled angrily, \"Let go of me!\" But Mark held on tighter, \"For your information, I was going to shoot Henry but I didn't because I risked hitting you! So chill the fuck out!\" With that, he flung Jen back to the ground and turned to walk away again. Jen rolled onto her hands and knees, breaking down into tears now, \"You should have. You should have gone ahead and killed us both…\" Again, Mark paused, \"Don't be ridiculous, I couldn't do that.\" Looking up at him with teary eyes, Jen shook her head, \"You don't know what you really saw back there…\" Silent in thought for a moment, Mark then turned back to face her again, \"What do you mean?\" Jen hung her head, shaking it and sobbing more. But Mark wasn't stupid. It suddenly clicked, what Henry had done to her, \"Shit…\" He sighed, feeling sympathetic, and walked back to her again, kneeling down to be eye-level with her, \"Hey, I'm sorry...\" his voice now soft, \"I wish I had known. I could have done more…\" Jen had started to shiver and Mark put his hands gently on her shoulders, \"Calm down. I know it's hard to, but you're going to be okay now. You need to come with me. I can't let him hurt you again… please, you can trust me.\" After slight hesitation, Jen finally nodded, saying nothing. Helping her up, he then gently put an arm around her to help lead her to his truck. \"My truck's not too far away. You can stay at my place. Henry doesn't know where it is.\" Jen nodded, \"I'd like to grab a few things. He's not home. He left after…\" Mark nodded, noticing her uncomfortable pause, \"Alright, but I'm coming with you though.\" She nodded as well. Once they were inside, Mark followed Jen around as she gathered some belongings and clothes, even helping her put them in a suitcase. \"Listen… I'm sorry about how I behaved back there. It was uncalled for, especially after circumstances…\" Mark apologized, sounding a bit disappointed in himself. Jen shook her head as she stuffed two shirts into the suitcase, \"Don't worry about it. I shouldn't have hit you in the head with that bottle.\" Mark grinned, \"Well… it was a pretty good shot.\" Jen paused, looking up to meet his grin, which then made her laugh, \"Well… thanks, I guess.\" Mark smiled, glad to have made her laugh. \"I think I'm all done.\" Jen said, closing the suitcase. Mark nodded and grabbed it, carrying it for her as he followed Jen back down the stairs. They didn't even hear Henry come back into the cabin 2 minutes ago and grab one of the iron bars that sat by the fireplace…[Chapter 5] Henry was waiting around a corner at the bottom of the staircase as Mark and Jen came down. As soon as one of Jen's feet hit the floor, Henry swung the bar out and it struck her cheek, knocking her aside to the floor and feeling dazed but still conscious. It was then swung at Mark but he blocked it with the suitcase and rounded the corner to deal with Henry. A sinister smirk now upon Henry's lips, he looked at his cousin, \"Good to see you again, Cuz.\" Mark glared back, dangerously, \"I'd love to know how the FUCK you are still alive. The fall should've killed you. But I guess it doesn't really matter, does it? Your shit ends NOW.\" Jen had finally pulled herself together and rounded the corner, standing behind Mark. \"Oh, hello love.\" Henry grinned. Jen glared. \"DON'T call her that… not after what you did to her!\" Mark responded angrily. Jen was taken aback at how full of hatred Mark sounded. \"Ah, yes. Caught some of the show, huh? I knew you would come…\" Henry's gazed moved to Jen for the final words, \"…no pun intended.\" Jen then leaned herself against a wall suddenly, breathing heavily. Mark pulled the keys from his pocket and handed them over to Jen, \"Jen, take the truck and get out of here.\" But Henry grinned, shaking his head, \"I doubt that'd be possible, right Jen?\" Jen had now slid down to a sitting position against the wall, still breathing heavily, and Mark went to her side, \"Jen?! What the hell did you do to her?!\" Henry just smiled, \"I was wondering when it would kick in. Did you enjoy your little drinking binge, darling? You know, some things don't mix well with alcohol.\" Upon hearing that, Jen acted quickly and stuck a finger in her throat in order to throw up whatever he had done. Mark patted her back. Henry sighed, \"Oh you party-pooper.\" Jen looked up at Henry, her eyes and expression full of hatred, \"Fuck you!\" \"Again?\" Henry laugh, \"Maybe. If that's really what you want, dear.\" This set Mark off and he jumped from Jen's side, rushing in at Henry, who laughed and grabbed him as he was almost tackled. He swung Mark as hard as he could and let go, sending him slamming against an opposite wall. Mark slid down into a sitting position against it, not unconscious, but dazed. Turning back toward Jen, the iron bar still in hand, Henry began to approach her and she got up to her feet as quickly as she could. When he swung it at her, she managed to grab hold and struggled to pull it from his grasp. \"You think you're stronger? That's cute, darling.\" Henry chuckled. Jen glared, still attempting to pull it free. Yanking it toward himself, Henry then kneed Jen in the stomach as she was pulled to him. This loosened her grip as she doubled-over a bit, and Henry took the opportunity to break her hold and slam the bar down on her back, sending her to her hands and knees. He raised the bar again, ready for another strike on her, but Mark suddenly tackled Henry from behind before he could hit her again. Falling over Jen, they fought on the floor. During the scuffle, Mark shouted out, \"Jen! The truck! Go..!\" At first, she was hesitant, not wanting to leave him to deal with Henry alone, but she finally obeyed and grabbed the suitcase as she rushed out the door. Her free hand reached to pull the keys from her pocket and she threw her suitcase in the back as she jumped into the truck as fast as she could and started the ignition. But once she cut the headlights on, she gasped. There, standing in her path, was Henry. He stood frozen, the iron bar in one hand as he glared hatefully at her. Jen's eyes narrowed and she put the truck in drive, speeding forward. Henry grinned, jumping on the hood and holding on with his free hand as he repeatedly slammed the bar against the windshield, wanting to bust it. Jen slammed on the breaks, which sent Henry flying and to the ground a few feet away. She put the truck in park and paused, waiting to see if Henry was still conscious. After a couple minutes of his body laying motionless on the ground, Jen exited the truck and ran back into the house, wanting to see if Mark was alright. Once inside, she gasped. Mark's body was laying still, on the floor through another doorway.[Chapter 6] \"Mark?!\" Jen cried out, rushing over to him and kneeling down to check his pulse. She breathed a sigh of relief soon after. There was a heartbeat. \"Thank god. Mark? Wake up.\" She shook him just a bit, hoping he would come to, but nothing, \"..please Mark… wake up.\" Glancing worriedly toward the exit, Jen wondered if she'd be able to get him out of there and into the truck before Henry woke. \"Please.\" She lightly shook him once more, but still nothing, \"..damn.\" A creak sound was heard nearby and Jen glanced all around them, seeing nothing, but she *did* notice the other iron bar by the fireplace. She rose to her feet and went to grab it quickly, then headed back to Mark's side and kept watch of their surroundings. Henry had recovered and chose to enter through the back, now standing watch for a moment in a doorway behind Jen before speaking up. \"Jen, Jen, Jen…\" He grinned, as Jen then spun around to face him, iron bar tightly in her grasp, \"Wow, look at you now, trying to be brave and tough. It's so cute. Too bad you're still just pathetic little Jen…you'll never make anything of yourself.. BUT, I do have to give you credit for one thing you're good for. Mmm.\" With a wink, he grinned a sinister smirk. Jen glared, but at the same time, felt frightened. Henry was having fun now, getting off on these games. Sure, it had been a while, but he hadn't lost his touch and he was proud of himself. \"Oh darling, why don't we have another go, hmm?\" And now he had stepped forward, but not raising his iron bar yet. \"Back off!\" Jen shouted, standing her ground and being protective of Mark even though she was scared. \"Ooh, feisty. I love it. Why weren't you more like this the last time?\" Henry teased. \"I don't understand, Henry… I don't understand why you have to be this way… why? We were together a year… and now this?\" Jen spoke up, almost in a pleading manner. But Henry chuckled, \"There's no one to blame but YOU, Jen. Everything… all of this right now, would probably never have had to happen… IF YOU HADN'T OPENED YOUR DAMN MOUTH and blabbed EVERYTHING about my existence!\" His voice now screaming in response, before swinging his iron bar at a lamp on a nearby table, smashing it. Jen jumped in fear, but remained where she was. \"YOU, Jen. YOU.\" Henry glared, but was loving his intimidation. This was just too damn easy, why was he even holding a weapon? He scoffed, realizing he wasn't going to need it against her, \"heh.\" He threw the iron bar to the floor and began to step forward toward Jen who was now panicking and stepping back as he approached, \"Stay away from me, Henry!\" But he just laughed, \"Come on babe, show me what you've got.\" Once Henry was within reach, Jen swung her iron bar out at his face, but he knew that was coming, so when she did it, he grabbed onto the bar with one hand before it touched him and swung his other fist at her face. It connected and Jen stumbled slightly but managed to keep her grip on the bar, pulling it closer to herself so that Henry would also be pulled in, and once he was, she took the opportunity to jerk her knee upward and into his groin. He shouted out in pain and doubled-over, losing his grip on the bar which then gave Jen her next opportunity. She struck Henry across the face with it, sending him to the floor. Making sure to remain aware of Henry, Jen went back over to Mark, \"Mark, please! Wake up!\" \"You bitch…\" Henry spat, still trying to recover. Jen looked back and watched Henry, \"You deserve it! For earlier, you ASSHOLE!\" \"Didn't see you resisting, babe. You know you loved it. It was good.\" He taunted. \"Shut up!\" Jen screamed. \"Admit it, lover…\" He grinned, watching her slowly fall apart, \"You love what I do to you.\" Jen shook her head and covered her ears now, \"No. Stop!\" Mark had now begun to awaken during Henry's taunting. Jen's eyes started to fill with tears and Henry was struggling to stand up straight, \"Aw, don't cry babe. Let me make it better…\" He stated as he took a couple steps toward her. \"NO!\" Jen screamed and stepped away, \"No! Stay away from me damn it!\" The memory plagued her. She didn't want to think of it, but Henry was doing his best to make sure it drove her crazy, \"Deny it all you like, but you WANTED IT.\" Mark pulled himself up to his feet now, having heard enough, \"That's ENOUGH, Henry! I'm sick of your mind-game bullshit! It's fucked up that you STILL get off on it. You're going to back the hell off of Jen, and NOW!\" \"Well. I detect feelings. Isn't that something.\" Henry responded with a shake of his head and glanced to Jen, \"Whore.\" Her eyes narrowed, \"Like you know any damn thing about feelings!\" Henry smiled, \"Oh I do, or actually … DID. Trust me Jen, I felt for you AT FIRST. But then…then THIS. No more. You ruined it by opening your fucking mouth. I guess you could say YOU are the reason I've rediscovered my old self. Are you proud, dear?\" \"Cut the bullshit Henry!\" Mark screamed in anger, before Jen could get a word out, \"I know you better than anyone. You've always been your 'old self', you just know how to hide it and fool everyone. I was there, remember?!\" He took a pause as a memory popped back into his head. It was the night Henry led him to believe he had poisoned the family's food and Susan had come to stop Mark from destroying it all. \"You had made ME look like the crazy one when I was just trying to stop you from hurting everyone! And if you ever TRULY loved this girl right here, you NEVER would have raped her!\" Henry smirked, \"You're right…\" his gaze then moving to Jen once more as he shrugged his shoulders, \"I never loved you Jen. In fact, I can't stand you. You were just so easily gullible. It was cute and fun…\" Jen looked so broken, \"But we… I thought… at first…\" Henry shook his head, \"NEVER… and you know what? I'll catch you two again soon…\" Grabbing up his iron bar from the floor, he then threw it across the room and into the electricity control box on a wall. As it busted open, sparks flew out and the lights flickered a few times before dying completely, leaving them in pitch-black darkness. Henry had made his escape… for now.[Chapter 7] Reaching out to grab Jen's hand, Mark then led her through the pitch-black darkness and toward the door, \"Come on.\" When they reached the truck, Mark opened the door for her to get in and then went around to get in and drive them off as quickly as possible. Jen handed over the keys, looking him over a bit, worried about his condition, \"Are you alright enough to drive? It looked like Henry really hurt you.\" \"I'm fine, don't worry. I'm going to get you to my place now.\" Mark responded with a nod, starting up the truck and getting them out of there. Ten minutes later, they turned onto a driveway from off of a back road. Mark's home was pretty secluded. It was a small brown, brick house lit up just a tiny bit because he had left his porch light on. It seemed to be in the middle of nowhere. There were no neighboring houses, just trees. \"This it is. You'll be safe here with me, Henry doesn't know about it.\" Mark assured Jen, but her only response was a small nod. Once they exited the truck, Mark grabbed Jen's suitcase and carried it for her as they entered the home, \"I have a guestroom. You can unpack in there, or I can help you.\" But Jen shook her head, \"It's fine, thank you. I can handle it.\" She was a bit distant and distraught, Mark could tell, \"Okay... well that's it right there, if you want to go ahead.\" He pointed to a door on the right. Nodding, Jen grabbed her suitcase and head toward the guestroom. Mark spoke up again, \"Jen…\" She paused, looking back at him from over her shoulder. \"It's gonna' be okay. We'll get through this.\" He tried to assure her, wanting to be of comfort since he knew Henry's assault was bothering her. Again, Jen merely nodded and then entered the room to begin unpacking. Mark sighed, knowing that she would be suffering for a while. After unpacking just a few small things, Jen flopped onto the bed in a sitting position, silent in thought as her mind raced with what had happened plus some of Henry's words echoing: 'You're still just pathetic little Jen.' … 'YOU, Jen. YOU.' … 'Didn't see you resisting, babe' … 'You were just so easily gullible' Feeling like she might cry, Jen covered her face with her hands. Mark approached the door, \"Hey Jen, I'm going to start making us some dinner. Are you…\" but he paused, noticing how she currently was, \"..hey, are you alright?\". His tone was soft and kind. Uncovering her face, Jen nodded, wanting to be strong and act like nothing was wrong, \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" \"Can I come in..?\" Mark asked, softly. \"Sure…\" Jen nodded again. Mark sighed and walked in, taking a seat gently down next to her, but Jen's eyes wouldn't meet his. She stared to the side, at a wall. \"Listen Jen…\" He began, his voice gentle and comforting, \"We're going to get through this. And Henry will pay, trust me…\" Jen nodded once more, \"I think I'd like to take a nap. You can go ahead and still cook.\" Mark stood, nodding before heading out the door again, \"I'm right out here. And you're safe. Let me know if you need anything before I come get you for dinner.\" He pulled the door shut behind him, but left it open in a crack. Jen flopped back onto the bed, quickly drifting off to sleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. It was as if she had been awake for days, though she hadn't. It was all her stress and emotions draining her physically. A rest was just what she needed, however, it would not come pleasantly. The same echoing words from Henry repeated themselves, as well as being followed by the nightmare of his assault. Jen began to toss and turn, crying out as well, \"NO!\" Mark had been in the kitchen, carrying some utensils toward the table when he heard her scream. He let them drop to the floor in the rush to her room and felt relief when he saw she was only dreaming. Leaning over her on the bed, he shook her lightly, \"Jen. It's okay, wake up.\" Jen's eyes shot open and she gasped, not fully awake enough or aware of her surroundings. Before she could get focused and control herself, she swung a fist and struck Mark in the face, sending him to the floor. Still freaking out and hyperventilating, she ended up rolling herself right off the other side of the bed. Mark got up and quickly rushed to her side, trying to calm her, \"Hey, hey… it's alright Jen. It's just me. Mark.\" \"God… I'm so sorry Mark. I thought you were…\" Jen began, but he stopped her, \"I know…I understand.\" She shook her head, \"Still… that was horrible, I should have waited until I was more awake. I just… had a nightmare…\" She apologized. Mark understood and nodded, \"Hey, it's okay. I know… I understand.\" He then extended a hand to help her up and she took it. As the doorbell rang out suddenly, Jen gasped. Mark smiled, \"Don't worry, that's just dinner. I decided to order out from a local Italian restaurant. Chicken alfredo pasta with a side of broccoli and cauliflower. It's great, I've had it before. And I have some sodas, beer, and even a bottle of wine I think.\" Jen chuckled nervously, \"I wouldn't say no to a drink right now. And the food sounds wonderful, thank you.\" Mark smiled again, \"Drinks are sitting on the kitchen counter, you go ahead and pick out what you'd like while I get the door.\" Jen entered the kitchen and chose to grab a beer before sitting down at the table and waiting for Mark to set up the food. The dinner was a mostly quiet one. Mark had stated to Jen that if she felt the need to talk, she was free to if she wanted. He didn't want her to hold everything in. Jen only shook her head, drinking down her beer faster than usual and remaining quiet. Mark sighed, worrying about her refusal to let things out and her sudden strong love of drinking, because after downing that beer, she began a second one. In addition, Jen had maybe only three or four bites of food before stating she was done and not feeling well. He just nodded and responded softly, \"Okay.\" Jen excused herself, taking the unfinished second beer along with her to her room.[Chapter 8] After the encounter with Mark and Jen, Henry decided this was going to take some serious plotting, even for him. As much as he hated to sit back and let them get away, he knew success came best after careful consideration. \"His favorite place to go is one from his younger days: that tunnel beneath a roadway that both he and Mark his in when they heard police racing to the accident caused by \"Mr. Highway\" being dropped. Leaning against the concrete wall, Henry smirked, \"You think you're free now Mark… but you're wrong. DEAD wrong. Both of you are.\" The voice of a child suddenly spoke up from the darkness of the tunnel, \"it never fails…\" Henry growled in response. That voice. He knew it well because it doesn't leave him alone. \"I swear… fuck off you little BRAT!\" Henry had yelled as a figure seemed to step forward. The young male figure was about half Henry's height and resembled him quite a bit. He looked to be around the age of ten of eleven and, with a smile on his face, he spoke up again, \"Good to see you too… brother.\" Richard. The boys' image had been haunting Henry. Appearing as a child rather than an infant, because it was much easier to haunt and disturb with an ability to speak. \"You're the one who's not 'free', Henry. All these stunts you pull are just a way for you to hide what you really are: the scared little boy inside, throwing a tantrum when he can't get his way…\" Richard's image grinned. Henry growled angrily once more, swinging a fist out at his little brother's image in an attempt to strike, but all that was there was air, and Richard had now vanished. Frustrated, Henry now slammed his fist as hard as he could into the concrete wall of the tunnel, causing blood to seep out from his knuckles and skin, dripping to the ground. But Henry didn't even wince. Instead, he started to laugh pretty maniacally for a couple of minutes before it faded and he sighed deeply. Looking around with a dangerous glare, Henry scoffed and shook his head before turning to leave, \"You'll pay too, dear little brother. Mark my words, and just watch this…\"[Chapter 9] Things were surprisingly quiet to Mark and Jen for about a month – no sign of Henry at all. Seriously?! This bothered Mark. It was too strange. He knew Henry had to be up to something. Sure, Henry didn't know their whereabouts, but it was still just too odd. 7AM came one morning and Jen was awaken by an awful sick feeling. She rushed out of bed, hoping that stepping out onto the porch for some air would calm the sudden nausea. Though she was still in her pajamas, she didn't care. Mark was seated right there in the living room as she came out and he smiled to her, \"Good morning, Jen.\" She only gave a weak smile and headed to the front door, \"Just gonna' get some air…\" She stepped out onto the porch, but the cool, crisp air did nothing for her so she decided to leave the porch and take a little walk around the yard. Still did not help. Mark walked to the front door to watch and make sure Jen remained safe. Staring at the ground as she walked, Jen's mind raced a bit. What was this? Had she caught some kind of bug? She had hoped it was only that, but the fact that her cycle late too was worrisome, \"oh please…\" she whispered to herself, \"please don't be what I think…\" As Jen headed for the front porch, she could've sworn the nausea was finally passing. Breathing a sigh of relief, she smiled. But once she had reached the bottom of the steps, there it came again and seemingly uncontrollable this time. Falling to her knees, Jen puked hard into the grass. Noticing this, Mark stepped out and went to her side, rubbing a gentle hand over her back. Once she had calmed, he looked to her with concern, \"Why don't we get dressed? I'll take you to a doctor-..\" \"No…\" Jen spoke quickly, cutting him off, \"I think I want to rest for a couple days, then see how I feel.\" Mark nodded, \"Okay, but if this gets any worse, I strongly suggest a doctor visit.\" Jen nodded to him, but inside she was freaking out. Luckily, she stayed as calm as possible on the outside, not wanting Mark to know of her fear. Jen remembered packing her personal kit. In it, she had a pregnancy test. \"I, I've got to use the restroom…\" Almost in a rush, she got up and headed inside to her room, pulled the test out, and snuck it into the bathroom just as Mark had come back inside. He didn't see her carrying anything because she had slipped it into her pajama pants pocket. \"I'll make us some breakfast, but something light and easy on the stomach.\" Mark had called out to her as he now headed into the kitchen. Minutes passed. The required time for her pregnancy test. It was time to look at it, but she hesitated at first, too afraid of the results. \"Please, please, please…\" She again whispered to herself, worried and about to panic. Very slowly, she reached out a hand to grab the test and force herself to look. Time seemed to stand still for a moment as she stared with widened eyes at the results, it dropping from her hand soon after as she stood catatonic/frozen/paused in a moment of mixed emotions, each battling inside before she finally collapsed to the floor. Jen was now sitting, rocking herself back and forth in silence.[Chapter 10] Twenty minutes passed. Mark had cooked up some soft-boiled eggs, but realized that Jen had not yet come out of the bathroom. He approached the door and knocked gently, \"Jen? Are you alright?\" Silence. \"Jen?\" He tried again, but still nothing. No responses. A moment later, a tiny sobbing sound could be heard. \"Jen, what's wrong? Please open up.\" Mark spoke gently, but also in a worried tone. She was still not answering or opening the door. \"Jen please, I'm here.\" He assured her, but sighed and stepped away for a moment to find a way to open up the door. Mark didn't want to be invasive, but he knew he needed to get to her. After grabbing a pair of scissors nearby, he opened them and inserted one of the ends into the door's lock-hole and jiggled it, \"Hang in there Jen, it'll be alright.\" He spoke again, softly and reassuring. After a couple of minutes, Mark again tried the handle and found that the door could now open. \"I'm coming in…\" He announced, wanting to give her notification before walking on in. There she sat on the floor, and staring down at it. \"Hey, I'm here…\" Mark began, as he placed the scissors on the sink and kneeled down in front of her, \"…what is it?\" But it would then catch his eye. The test lay on the floor next to her. \"…oh. Shit.\" He reached out and embraced her, \"I'm here Jen…\" And he paused once he felt Jen's arms raise and embrace him back, \"you're going to be okay. I'm here for whatever you need, and whatever decision you want to make about this.\" Gently brushing some hair away from her eyes, Mark looked to her, \"Just say the word, and I'd take you to where we'd need to go for this. But whatever you decide, Jen, I'm going to be here.\" This frustrated Jen a bit and her teary eyes now narrowed, \"Don't feel obligated to me because of what your cousin did, Mark. It's not right! I don't want your pity!\" \"Calm down. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you, I'm just saying you won't have to deal with things alone.\" Standing up, he helped Jen to her feet as well and they exited the bathroom. With a sigh, Jen stormed off to her bedroom and let the door slam behind her. Mark frowned. His anger on the inside about Henry was starting to eat away at him. Was this part of the asshole's plan? Knowing Henry and the games he loved to play, he wouldn't put it past him. This was truly sick . \"What the hell are you up to, Henry?\" Mark mumbled to himself before going to the door of Jen's bedroom, \"Jen, there's some eggs ready in the kitchen if you'd like something to eat. I'm all out of orange juice, so I'm just going out for a minute to grab some. I swear I won't be long, okay?\" But he was just met with more silence. As much as he hated to leave her completely alone, it seemed to be what she needed for now. Just a few minutes while he ran to a store wouldn't hurt. He had trouble believing that, but would repeat it to himself over and over: The store's not far. Henry doesn't know this location. She'll be alright. I'll let her calm. Three minutes later, he was out the door and heading for the store. Jen began to pace around the room. Her mind was such a mess and now a mixture of emotions began to whirl inside of her intensely. Panic, anger, desperation, despair. She paused to place both hands on her head and closed her eyes, now balling her fists which each gripped hair. Her breathing grew heavy as a breakdown was building and coming forth. And, to make matters worse, she could once again hear the echo of Henry's words: \"…you are good for one thing…mmm.\", \"Didn't see you resisting, babe, you know you loved it..\", \"You love what I do to you..\", \"You were just so easily gullible.. it was cute and fun.\" That was it! The breaking point! In a sudden fit of rage, Jen's eyes flew open again and she let out a blood-curdling scream as she turned to a nightstand that stood by the bed and swooped an arm out across it, knocking everything on it, including a lamp, to the floor. \"I HATE YOU!\" She shouted at the top of her lungs, lifting the nightstand and launching it across the room into a mirror on the closet door. It shattered to pieces and she finally collapsed to the floor in a sitting position immediately after, weeping.[Chapter 11] Half an hour had passed. Jen was now taking slow, deep breaths, having calmed a bit. On the outside, anyway. In her mind, was a different story. For now, the echo of Henry was gone… but replaced with a sense of hopelessness. It had to end. ALL of it. She did not want to live anymore. Jen wanted everything over with, but quick and now. A blank, lifeless stare was now upon her face as she left the bedroom and wandered around the house, searching for anything she could use to make it immediate. Knives in the kitchen and cleansers in the bathroom would not be good enough. Perhaps Mark's bedroom would hold the answer. She went in and quickly began to rummage through his dresser drawers, trying to feel beneath clothing for anything gun-like. Nothing in the top drawer. Same for the second one. But once she felt around in the third drawer, she breathed a sigh of relief. In the right corner of it, underneath two pairs of pants, was a small black handgun. And loaded. Mark had just pulled up, exited his truck, and headed inside carrying a single plastic bag with an orange juice carton in it. Jen was so lost in her thoughts, she didn't notice or hear him enter the home. Mark was about to call out for Jen until he noticed some movement going on in his bedroom. Quietly setting the bag down onto the couch, he tiptoed to the doorway just in time to see that it was Jen, who was now raising the gun up to her head. \"Jen, NO !\" He screamed in utter shock and fear. Startled, Jen jumped a bit and spun around to face him, the gun now held out and pointed at him. \"Whoa … \" Mark responded and held up his hands, remaining calm, \"Jen, put the gun down please. You're stronger than this.\" Her head shook, \"You don't understand! You don't understand what it's like! I can't- I can't live like this… hearing his voice in my head! Taunting me! Laughing about what he did…!\" Once again, she rose the gun to her head and Mark immediately rushed forward into the room a few more steps before freezing again, because Jen aimed at him once more, \"Stay away, Mark! I have to do this…\" Tears streamed down her cheeks, simply because she was aiming a gun at Mark. She didn't want to be. She didn't want to hurt him. He'd been so kind and protective. It was just a scare tactic. She wanted to end her life and didn't want him to stop her. \"Jen, if you do this, you're letting Henry win. I have faith in you and I know you're stronger than him. Please, don't let him do this to you. You're right, okay? I don't know what it's like- the torment that you're going through… but I want to be here for you. We can deal- together. I want you here with me. Don't give in to his voice…\" Mark tried, pleading and hopefully was reassuring enough to her. Jen stared in silence, the gun now slowly lowering. At this, Mark began to step forward again, but slowly. Once he was in front of her, he reached out for the gun and found it easy to take away. Jen had let go as soon as he touched it. Mark let the bullets drop out of it to the floor and tossed the gun out the doorway, then pulling Jen into him for a firm, but caring embrace. She embraced back slowly, but still stood pretty stoic. At that moment, Mark's cell phone began to ring from his pocket. He let go of Jen and gave her a smile before answering it. She gave a weak smile back. \"Hello?\" Mark spoke, bringing the cell up to his ear. \"Guess who.\" A voice on the other end teased. Sinister laughter followed.[Chapter 12] Henry. Mark stared at Jen, not really sure whether or not he should respond. At the moment, she was clearly not emotionally stable, so he held up a finger as if saying to hold on for a second, and excused himself from the room. Once he was in the living room, he spoke up but kept a low tone, \"How the fuck did you get this number?\" \"Oh Mark, I'm surprised at you. You underestimate me. I always have my ways. Just like I'll find my way to wherever you two are hiding and maybe even have some more fun with Jen before I destroy you... heh heh heh…\" This infuriated Mark. He still managed to keep the low tone of voice, though it would be hard, \"You will NOT touch her again!\" Henry just laughed at him, loving that he was striking a nerve, \"Ooh, definitely some feelings there. You'll make such a cute couple before I stab your fucking guts out. And I will, mark my words. The hunt is on…\" and with that, a click. Henry had now hung up before giving Mark a chance to respond. Mark sighed and swung a hand out, knocking a coaster on a nearby table off and it flew across the room. \"That was him, wasn't it?\" Jen asked, now walking up behind him. She had come into the living room just in time to see what Mark had done, \"What did he say?\" Mark opened his mouth to respond, but then decided against it and shook his head. Suddenly, his phone began to ring once more and, with a sigh, he answered it, \"Hello?!\" There was a pissed off expression on his face as he expected it to once again be Henry. However, he was met with a woman's voice, \"May I speak with Mark Evans?\" He felt some relief, glad to not be dealing with Henry again right now, \"Speaking.\" \"Mister Evans, my name is Vickie Walters. I'm with the Trinton Hotel on Smalls Avenue. I'm afraid there's been an accident.\" Mark's eyes grew wide, knowing his Aunt Susan, Uncle Wallace, and cousin Connie had all been on a relaxing mini-vacation and staying there, \"What kind of accident?! What happened?! Is everyone okay?!\" he panicked. On the other end, Vickie was now silent for a moment, hating to be the bearer of bad news. \"I'm sorry Mister Evans… there's been a fire on the floor that Wallace, Susan, and Connie Evans were staying on. I'm afraid it's claimed nine lives, including them…\" Mark went numb and at that moment, his cell phone slipped from his hand and dropped onto the floor. He collapsed to his hands and knees immediately after, an intense wave of emotion sweeping over him. \"No, no, no, no…\" he whispered , tears now leaking from his eyes. \"Mark…\" Jen knelt down next to him and reached over to grab up the phone and finish the call for him, \"I'm sorry, is there a number he can best reach you at? He needs some time.\" \"Of course. And please tell him I'm so sorry for his loss…\" Vickie responded with sympathy and caring in her tone, then left a number for Mark to call back later. Jen entered it in his phone after hanging up. \"Mark… what happened?\" Jen asked, gently placing a hand to his shoulder, \"talk to me.\" Taking a deep breath, Mark seemed to have to fight to get the words out, \"M-My Aunt, Uncle, and- and a cousin… they're dead…\" Jen was speechless. What could she even say at a time like this anyway? Her hand on his shoulder changed to an arm around him, and he rested his head against her shoulder, trying to resist the urge to burst into immense sobbing.[Chapter 13] Five minutes had passed and Mark lifted his head to look at Jen, and she turned her head to look back. \"Jen...\" He began, calmer for the moment, \"Go on into the kitchen and get yourself some of the eggs I made. I'm going to step outside and return the call.\" She handed him back his cell phone and nodded before heading to the kitchen to let him have his privacy. On her way, she also grabbed the grocery bag with the orange juice in it which still sat on the couch. Inside, Mark could feel himself fuming again. He knew this to be no accident, it had Henry written all over it. Jen got herself a plate of eggs, a glass of orange juice, and took a seat at the table, looking toward the front door as Mark spoke with Vickie again on his cell out on the front porch. Ten minutes had passed and Jen had finished up, standing from the table now and taking her plate to the sink. She returned to the table to gulp down the rest of her juice and after a couple steps toward the sink again, she paused. What was that sound? A noise. A pretty odd one. It had sounded like wings flapping. Or maybe the whip of a coat in heavy winds. Then, a feeling. Something stood not too far behind her. It was eerie. Jen hesitated to look back, but at the same time, curiousity struck. So, slowly, she turned and once she was face-to-face with what was there, she gasped and literally jumped back a bit. However, as she did, she lost her footing and slipped which resulted in her falling backwards to the floor and slamming her head against the cabinets beneath the sink. It ached so much, that Jen was sure she was now bleeding, though she wasn't. She sat back up quickly, a hand over the spot on her head, \"Who are you?! How did you get in here?!\" It was a man, average height. Brown hair, blue eyes, and wearing a beige-colored overcoat. He stared down at Jen, his expression calm and pretty serene. And honestly, he was rather attractive. \"Jennifer...\" He spoke up, raspiness in his voice, \"I mean you no harm.\" Her name! He knew it! \"Stay away from me! Henry sent you! How else can you know me?! MARK!\" Jen screamed, panicking, and threw the glass she had been drinking from at him as hard as she could, aiming for his face. The man reached out to intercept the glass, catching it. He looked at it for a moment then sat it down on the kitchen table next to him. He calmly took a step forward, \"He won't see me. Please, calm down.\" \"Get away! MARK, HELP!\" Jen cried out again. This time the man stayed put and didn't move. Mark had just finished the call when he heard Jen that second time and nearly broke the front door on his rush back inside. He ran into the kitchen and hurried to her side, kneeling down when he saw her on the floor, \"Hey, what happened? Why are you on the floor?\" Jen raised an arm, pointing a finger at the mysterious man who had appeared. Mark turned his head, looking at the area she pointed toward, but he didn't see a thing, \"What? What are you pointing at?\" The man shook his head, \"I told you he wouldn't see me, Jennifer.\" \"... you don't see him...\" She whispered and put her hands to her head, whimpering, \"I'm going crazy, aren't I...?\" Mark shook his head and helped Jen back up to her feet, \"Relax. You're fine. I think the stress of what happened can affect the mind, but try to focus... you've got to stay focused as best you can. Can you do that for me?\" He immediately regretted the way he said that last part to her. It almost felt as if his tone were speaking to a child, but Jen seemed unbothered as she nodded slowly. Her attention was elsewhere. To Mark, she was staring off into space.. but in reality, her eyes were actually back on the strange man again, \"How do you know my name?\" Mark was worried. She was obviously beginning to show signs of losing her mind. \"Jen, there's no one there. Stay with me.\" He stepped into the path of where she'd been looking, wanting her attention back. The man was now blocked from Jen's view and she looked at Mark, \"Oh. I'm sorry Mark. You're right... this has to be my imagination.\" The man's head tilted a bit, \"I'm not a figment of your imagination, Jennifer. I am an angel. I'm your angel.\" That was certainly unexpected. Jen paused and suddenly burst into laughter. Hysterically. Mark stared at her now, growing more worried. What was this sudden outburst about? She really did seem to be losing her mind. \"Oh...\" Jen finally calmed enough to speak, \"...that was funny!\" The man now appeared disappointed at her reaction. \"Uh, Jen... come on, I think you'd better rest...\" Mark said as he took her by the hand and guided her back to her bedroom.[Chapter 14] Author's Note: The introduction of the angel here is borrowed from the series Supernatural . If you're a fan, you'll see what I mean. I love Castiel in the series, and his introduction in it is one of my FAVORITE scenes.. I wanted to take from that a bit. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ After Jen settled onto the bed and wrapped herself up in a blanket, Mark left to give her some time to nap. He was beginning to grow worried about her after this odd behavior she had just shown. However, some rest would do her well... right? Her eyes had closed and she was now relaxed and calm, ready to drift off into dreamland until a voice broke through the silence, \"Jennifer.\" Jen opened her eyes again and looked up. The man was back and standing at her bedside, but Jen just shook her head and shut her eyes tightly, \"Not real, not real, not real, not real...\" she repeated to herself. \"I can assure you. I'm here. I'm real...\" and with that, he reached out a hand and touched her lightly on the arm. She could actually feel it. Opening her eyes once more, she stared up at him, \"But it can't be. Angels don't exist.\" Again, the man appeared to be very disappointed, \"You never did seem to have much faith, Jennifer. But please, trust this.\" After taking a couple steps back, he then stood very still, and the room now flashed as if there was lightning happening outside. But it was no lightning. This angel was trying to give a demonstration in order to prove himself. As her room flashed, Jen stared wide-eyed at him. HUGE black angel wings now appeared from this man's back, and when the flashing was over, he was back to normal again. Jen gaped, but still, she didn't know what to think, \"But... but it can't be. This is just a dream. it has to be.\" He shook his head, \"If this is what it has to come down to, I guess I have no choice. Please don't panic, Jennifer, no harm is about to be done.\" ... \"Huh? What are you-...\" Jen began to ask, but there was an interruption. Mark had now stepped back in to check on her and he FROZE, but not for long. He could see the man now and grew protective, \"Hey! Who are you?! Get the hell away from her!\" Quickly, Marked rushed in at him, swinging a fist, but it was caught inches before it had connected. The angel lifted his left hand and placed the index and middle fingers against Mark's forehead. Mark's body immediately went limp and fell unconscious to the floor. \"Mark!\" Jen screamed, and the angel turned back to her. \"Calm down, he is only sleeping. I'm hoping you believe and trust in me now.\" Jen jumped from the bed and rushed over to check on Mark. It was true. He seemed to only be sleeping. \"My name is Castiel...\" the angel then introduced himself as Jen was knelt down by Mark and looking over him. She looked back up after the introduction. \"...by the way.\" He finished. There was an awkward pause. After a couple of minutes, Jen was ready to speak up and say something but now another noise else had broken through the lingering silence instead. A knock at the front door. Jen hesitated and Castiel's head tilted as he noticed her uneasiness, \"Henry wouldn't knock, Jennifer. There's no need to be afraid. You can answer it...\" His face then changed to serious as he looked toward the doorway, sensing an urgency from the visitor, \"...in fact, you should answer it...\" The knock repeated, only this time, it didn't end. *Knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-etc* Over and over. Whoever stood outside now seemed desperate to get an answer. Jen left the bedroom without a word and Castiel lifted Mark from the floor and placed him on the bed. Jen approached the front door, but cautiously, and took a minute to peek out a window next to it. There stood a blonde girl who looked to be in her early 20s, around Jen's age. This girl was obviously upset since she was now basically slamming her palm against the door nonstop. Jen now took another minute to look over her. The girls' clothing looked pretty tattered and even burned! Clearly she was in some distress as well as she then cried out, \"Mark, please!\" Jen took a breath and decided to open the door. The girl was ready to immediately speak, but paused when she saw that it was not Mark standing there. \"...hi... does Mark still live here?\" It was so clear to Jen now that this girl had definitely been through something horrific. Her hair was a tangled mess and her face dirty, as if from soot. \"Are you okay? What's happened to you?\" Jen asked, sincerely concerned. \"Please, just answer me... does Mark live here...?\" She was obviously still upset and on the verge of tears. Also, there was something familiar about her to Jen, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it at the moment. \"He does...\" Jen nodded, \"How do you know him?\" \"I'm his cousin.\" At those words, it suddenly hit Jen and she winced, \"Cousin. Are you... are you Henry's sister?\" The resemblance was now obvious. The girl nodded, fighting back tears, \"My name is Connie.\" Jen stepped aside, holding the door open for Connie to enter. She stepped in quickly and looked around, \"Where's Mark? It's urgent!\" Jen paused for a moment and looked toward the doorway of her bedroom, \"He's uh...\" Castiel stood there now, looking out at them, but was apparently only visible to Jen because Connie did not seem to notice him. \"He's... resting.\" Jen finished. Connie now wasted no time in heading toward the room Mark was in, \"Well we're in danger and need to do something!\" Castiel was still standing there and Connie passed right through him as if he was a ghost. Jen had been following a few steps behind and paused at that sight, just a bit creeped out. Noticing that she was spooked, Castiel decided to step aside to let her enter with ease. Connie was at the bedside now and shaking Mark in an attempt to wake him, but he was not responding to anything. \"Mark wake up! Hey... WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?!\" she yelled as she turned back to face Jen.[Chapter 15] Author's note: I don't feel this chapter is very good, but as always, I tried. After this, I have a very busy week ahead, so I will not be writing. I also need to take time to think of where to go with this story next.. *feels writers-block creeping in* . Thanks for continued support and i hope you find this enjoyable even though I don't. lol ;) _ Jen was standing in the doorway, stunned. She glanced to Castiel, who offered no response. Looking back to Connie, she opened her mouth to try to answer, but was interrupted. \"You did something to him, didn't you?! Apparently you know my brother Henry, so what have you done to Mark?!\" Connie yelled at Jen, her tone a mixture of despair and demanding. Jen shook her head, trying to process all of this now in order to find an explanation that wouldn't make her sound crazy, \"I didn't do anything to him! I would never hurt Mark.\" \"How the hell do you know my brother?!\" Connie demanded again. Jen stared at her quietly. The right answer was definitely not going to help , then again, neither was this silence. \"I don't know how to answer that right now. Can you please calm down?\" \"How calm would you be after losing both parents and almost dying along side them?! I couldn't save them! I tried! I couldn't! But I will save Mark here! He did so much for my family long ago...\" Connie ranted, a threatening tone of voice now apparent. Jen took a step back and tried to remain calm, \"Okay. Please, just try to calm down. I may not understand everything you've been through, but I relate in a way. I've lost my parents too...\" Jen spoke in an attempted soothing tone, trying to calm and reason with Connie, who was obviously ready to explode at any second. But the words seems to fall on deaf ears, as she didn't seem to want to hear any of this. \"Okay, you know what?! The longer you go without telling me what's wrong with Mark, the angrier it makes me...\" And with those words, Connie started to approach Jen. Then, a ringing. Connie paused. Mark's cell phone was ringing from his pocket and, for a few seconds, the girls stared at each other in silence. Jen finally made the decision to move forward in an attempt to go for the phone, but Connie reached out and shoved her back lightly, \" I will get that.\" Jen sighed and glanced to Castiel again. Why was he being so quiet? She mouthed a 'what the fuck?' to him, but he only shrugged. As Connie had her back turned, Jen pointed to Mark and looked questioningly at the angel. \"He's fine, stay calm.\" He finally spoke up, only heard by Jen. Mark's cell phone was already sticking halfway out of his pocket, so Connie grabbed it up easily and looked at the callers ID: \"Unavailable\". But despite that, she answered anyway, \"Mark's phone, Connie speaking.\" There was a pause as the person on the other end was silent. \"Hello?\" Connie said. Finally, a male's voice responded, \"Connie. Wow... I heard about the little accident... nice to know that you're okay.\" Sarcasm was quite obvious. \"Henry!\" Connie screamed, truly pissed off, \" Accident my ASS. I know that you were behind the fire! I saw you leaving the scene before I got out! How fucking DARE you! Mom and Dad are dead!\" Henry stifled a laugh, which only increased Connie's rage. At the same time, tears streamed down her cheeks. \"Connie, we haven't seen each other in so long. Now how can you be so sure that the person was me? Puh-leez.\" Henry was taunting her and loving every second of it. Connie was so angry now, that her grip on the cell phone tightened more and more and it was quite a surprise that it had not yet broken under the pressure, \"That doesn't matter, ASSHOLE ! No matter how much time has passed, I will always know you when I see you...\" Her teeth were gritted as she spoke, making it obvious how upset she was. \"Aw, sisterly love.\" Henry taunted, getting a kick out of it. Then, he formed an idea. \"Hey... you're on Mark's phone. That must mean you're with my girl too. Did she get the job done? Is Mark dead yet?\" In true Henry fashion, he figured why not have some fun and toy with someone again? Unfortunately for Jen, this situation Henry was describing looked all too real. Connie spun around to look at Jen again and Henry continued, his lips having formed an evil smirk as he spoke, \"My Jen is awesome at that whole innocent act. She reminds me of myself in a way.\" \"I knew it...\" Connie growled and hung up the phone, letting it drop from her hand as she stormed toward Jen. Henry chuckled to himself and let out a sigh of content as he leaned back into his couch, proud and relaxing, \"It's a shame I'm not there to witness what I just created. At least my attempt to kill Connie wasn't a total loss. I've just made use of her.\" Henry loved to hear himself talk about accomplishments, but once again, he wasn't totally alone. The ghostly image of Richard had returned and now stood at his brothers' side, facing him, \"You are pathetic.\" \"Keep it up, Rich. Keep it up. I'm going to make you so sorry, you'll be glad that you're dead...\" Henry responded, rather calmly. This whole thing with Richard was stupid and Henry was determined to do his best to not let it drive him mad. (as if he isn't already..). It was obvious he'd been losing to the brat lately, but not this time. Without another word, the boys' image faded and Henry smirked, feeling victorious. Connie closed in on Jen, the space between them now only a foot, if that, and Connie reached out to grab Jen by the collar of her shirt and shoved her back against a wall, holding her there, \"What did you do to him?! And don't pull the innocent shit with me again! Henry just told me all about it!\" Connie screamed in Jen's face. \"What the hell are you talking about? I haven't done anything! Henry is lying, don't fall for his game... aren't you smarter than that?!\" Jen shouted back, standing her ground despite the fear that now ran through her. Castiel immediately waved a hand toward Mark, which woke him again. As Mark's vision started to come into focus, he could see Jen pinned to a wall by a blonde girl. Connie's back was to him, so he did not yet know who this was. \"Stop pretending!\" Connie screamed again and brought a fist up and into Jen's face. This alerted Mark, definitely. Didn't matter that he still felt woozy, he jumped from the bed and yanked this girl away from Jen, \"Back off..!\" He yelled and spun her around to face him, then paused in shock. Connie immediately wrapped her arms around him tightly, \"Mark! You're okay!\" \"Connie?\" Mark finally spoke up as he returned the hug, \"I thought you had died with Aunt Susan and Uncle Wallace.\" \"Oh Mark, I'm so sorry! I couldn't save them! I tried! I wanted to!\" She cried out hysterically, tears streaming once again. \"Shh. I believe you Connie. I'm glad you made it out.\" Mark had told her, gently patting her on the back. Castiel looked angrily at Mark and went to Jen's side. He laid a gentle hand on her cheek, healing the pain that she felt from Connie's punch. Jen looked back into the angels' eyes, a soft smile on her lips and head tilted into his palm. Mark and Connie released each other. \" Connie, why the hell did you just hit Jen?\" \" She's a fraud!\" Connie yelled and tried to go at Jen again, but Mark grabbed onto an arm to stop her, \"Whoa! Cool down. Jen is innocent. She's a victim in all of this too.\" \"Mark, Henry called your cell. He explained all about his girl Jen mastering the innocent act as he always did and said there was a plan to kill you! You were laying there motionless, unable to be woken. I thought she succeeded...\" Connie shot a glare at Jen during that last bit. Mark looked a bit confused, unsure of what to say at first. He couldn't remember exactly what had just happened to him, \"Connie... come on, you should know better than to believe anything that sick fuck has to say. Here's the truth... Jen was dating Henry. WAS. She isn't with him anymore. He raped her ... and, she's pregnant.\" Castiel had a comforting around around Jen, and was still unseen by the other two. Jen's eyes were glued to the floor at the moment, partly frustrated and partly ashamed. Connie had cooled down now, \"I'm sorry... I didn't know...\" \"Of course...\" Jen huffed, \"...you were too busy believing your liar brother and assuming. I hate this family.\" She turned now and left the room, Castiel following.[Chapter 16] Author's note: There's a scene in this chapter that wasn't originally planned. I felt it before bed that night and decided to add it in. And to be honest, it related to myself in a way. I believe that if there's something a writer needs to get out, and it could easily fit into the story, do it :) Hope you enjoy. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX That evening, Henry fell into slumber earlier than usual. It was currently only 8:02pm. He would never admit to it, but Richard was still draining him. And not just during the waking hours. It was near impossible for Henry to close his eyes and NOT see his younger brother. EVERY time. And now, on came another dream: It was freezing. A familiar setting too. But, something was wrong. Water. Henry couldn't breathe. Whenever he tried, icy waters entered his airway and filled the lungs. He choked, tried to struggle, but could not seem to move. His vision was pitch-black at first, but slowly, images began to come into focus. But no sounds. He seemed to be floating under a big plate of glass, because there were faces looking down through it, staring at him. Henry stared back at them, still paralyzed, and right then he knew why this was familiar. This wasn't glass, it was a sheet of ice! This is the kind of thing Connie went through when he had tried to get rid of her so long ago. All the faces began to fade away, except for one. Richard. His expression was serious and seemed to say 'How does it feel?' . Everything went pitch-black again, and then a soft whisper into Henry's ear: \"...die, brother...\" Henry jumped awake and flew into a mini-rage. Grabbing the nearest object, which happened to be an alarm clock on the table next to the couch he slept on, he flung it across the room. After slamming into the wall and dropping to the floor, it went off loudly. Henry growled and grabbed a hammer as he stormed over to where it lay. \"I'm done playing!\" He screamed out and smashed it into as many tiny pieces as possible, bringing silence again. Letting the hammer drop to the floor, he caught his breath and calmed as best he could. \"I'm done playing.\" He repeated, this time quietly and serious. Henry threw on his coat and started to head out into the night, grabbing up the hammer again on his way out - a last minute decision. xxxxx Jen was so tempted to walk out the front door that evening. After all of the chaos from today, she isolated herself, only accepting Castiel by her side. Connie had tried to reach out and apologize to Jen earlier, but Jen told her not to touch her and to go away. Mark wanted to talk and be supportive, but she even turned him away as well. He finally accepted defeat and let her be to herself for a bit to cool down from all that stress. Jen sat down on the side of her bed, her eyes staring sadly at the floor. She said nothing, and Castiel approached. \"May I sit with you, Jennifer?\" His voice was soft and only nodded and he joined her. \"Talk to me, let it out.\" Jen sighed, \"I've got a problem, Castiel. And it's so wrong . So fucked up. I shouldn't even have this problem...\" \"I'm listening. Get it out Jennifer, you don't deserve the burden of keeping things inside.\" Castiel's gentle hand now rested on her back. \"I'm so broken inside. I do my best lately to mask it outside. Castiel...\" Her eyes raised now and looked directly into his, \"I'm still so hurt by Henry's complete turn-around.\" Castiel nodded slightly and Jen continued, \"I'm not saying I still love him. God I hope this isn't that. It's just... well, I put my trust... all my trust and heart... and, hell, even soul... yeah... my life, it was good... or I thought it was anyway. Can you understand what I'm saying...?\" Jen's eyes were moistening as fresh tears prepared to fall, \"How can I still hurt so much over this evil guy who did me SO wrong? I DON'T want to feel this way!\" Her tears fell now, leaving a stream down her cheeks and Castiel reached out, wiping them away gently. \"Jennifer, this is all normal. And you're going to be okay. I understand what you're trying to say. You thought you'd found all you needed. Your heart let down its shields and embraced what it believed to be a castle, only to later find out he had his own secret balcony that wasn't there before.\" Jen chuckled nervously, \"So to speak.\" \"You don't love him anymore after this, your heart and soul are just traumatized and in need of healing. I'm here to help. Know that.\" Castiel wiped another tear away and gave her a sweet smile. \"Thanks.\" Jen smiled back. \"Come on...\" Castiel stood, helping Jen to her feet, \"let's get out for a bit.\" \"Go out? What about Mark?\" Castiel shook his head, \"Forget about them right now, this time is for you.\" Jen said no more, just nodded in approval. It was very sudden. Maybe only about 2 seconds later, Jen and Castiel were now standing in a night club and he led her over to a table. The dance floor was packed. Tons of people were enjoying themselves tonight and currently dancing to \"Call On Me\" by Eric Prydz. Jen was surprised that no one seemed to notice their mysterious appearance. As they sat down, Castiel offered to get her something to drink. \"Just some lemon water is fine.\" With a snap of his fingers, Castiel made a glass of Jen's beverage appear on the table in front of her. \"Wow! That... that's amazing.. thank you Castiel.\" She laughed. Castiel grinned. He was glad that he could take her mind off of things, at least for now. \"Go on and taste it. I guarantee you there's no other quite like it.\" Jen laughed again, \"Well aren't you proud of yourself. Okay.\" She lifted the glass to her lips and began to drink. It was just going to be a quick taste, but it was so delicious, her tasting lasted a few more seconds. \"Ahh...\" She breathed as she set the glass back down, \"You're right, Castiel, that is some fantastic lemon water there. Heavenly...\" Jen laughed some more and shot a wink in his direction. This brought a chuckle from Castiel as well. xxxxx From the upstairs level, a figure now stood looking over the railing and right down at them. \"Isn't this interesting.\" The male said to himself. It was Henry. He had been hanging around and drinking in this same bar for the past 25 minutes. Downing the last of his whiskey in a quick shot, he smiled in his usual sinister/creepy way and reached into his coat pocket, where he pulled the hammer back out. \"I'm done playing.\" He mumbled to himself.[Chapter 17] Author's note: This is the fastest I've ever written a chapter. It really flowed. I'm kinda proud of this one and things are \"heating up\" as you'll see. Hope you enjoy! XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Mark had been sitting in his living room talking with Connie a bit. \"It's important that we get things straightened out. Henry is enough of a cause of stress, I don't want things to be bad between you two.\" He had told her as he rose from his seat and went to the door of Jen's bedroom. \"Jen?\" He called out as he knocked at the door. \"Jen, the three of us all need to talk. It's important we get this worked out.\" Silence. Mark began to feel uneasy, \"Jen?\" More silence. He opened the door slowly and peeked in. The room was completely empty and he quickly flung the door all the way open when he noticed, \"Jen?!\" Connie jumped up when she heard Mark panicking and he turned back to her, his eyes wide in horror, \"She's gone!\" Connie rushed over to the bathroom to check it and Mark watched, hopeful, until she looked back and shook her head. \"Henry.\" Mark growled, running over to grab his coat off the rack by the front door. Connie followed and he gave her a spare jacket. \"You think? But how? Wouldn't we have heard something?\" \"He's tricky. I wouldn't put it past him. I refuse to let him hurt her again!\" Mark ranted and hurried out to his truck, Connie following. xxx Peering down at the two again, Henry's free hand firmly gripped the railing. Partly in anger, but mostly because he began to sway. He had overdone the drinking tonight and was feeling it now. His focus was mainly on Jen, \"Ready or not...\" Even though he was drunk, his aim would be surprisingly perfect as he flung the hammer down toward the back of her head. It flew fast and was just inches from striking her until Castiel quickly raised a hand to freeze it in midair. The angel rose from his seat, glaring up at the area where Henry stood. Henry stared back, wide-eyed with a \"WTF?\" look. Jen followed Castiel's move and stood, spinning around to see what he was glaring at. She was met with the sight of the hammer still hovering there and gasped in surprise. Castiel let it drop and waved a hand, which sent a powerful force up and into Henry, sending him flying back several feet and crashing into a wall. He was knocked unconscious for the moment. \"Come on Jennifer.\" Castiel took her hand and even grabbed onto the glass of lemon water he had made for her and they vanished from the club. xxx Mark had his foot down heavily on the gas pedal, which had Connie a bit startled. \"Mark, do you even have an idea of where to look for her?\" He nodded, never taking his eyes off of the road in front of them, \"We're going to the house where they lived.\" \"And if no one's there?\" \"I'll still get some revenge...\" Mark told her, sounding so serious and angry it scared her, \"...ready or not, Henry.\" xxx Castiel and Jen had now reappeared back in the bedroom. With a sigh, he looked down to the floor and felt ashamed, \" I did not mean to put you in harms way. I had no idea he'd be there.\" Jen took the glass of water he'd been holding and set it down on a nightstand, \"Don't blame yourself, Castiel. I don't. It just happened, but we're okay, and-\" She paused. There was that feeling again. \"...oh god.\" Jen fled from the room and into the bathroom where she collapsed to her knees in front of the toilet and vomited. Castiel teleported to her side and rubbed her back gently. Once she had finished, she reached up to hit the handle and flush, breathing heavily, \"Sorry. Ugh... that was embarrassing.\" \"Are you feeling better?\" The angel asked, true sincerity and care in his tone. \"For now I suppose. Hey... wait...\" She picked herself back up quickly and left the bathroom, now searching the place, \"Mark and Connie aren't here. Oh no! Castiel, they must have noticed me gone . It's not safe out there! We just had an interaction with Henry, he could get to them too!\" Jen panicked and started to head for the front door but Castiel teleported into her path and gently rested his hands on both her shoulders, stopping her, \"Henry's not a threat to them right now, please, trust me. You need to remain here. They're going to be okay. Jen sighed. xxx Mark and Connie reached the cabin where Henry and Jen once lived together and after shutting off the truck, Mark got out and ran up to the door, not even bothering to wait for Connie. She soon met up with him though. The door was locked and Mark growled in frustration. \"What now?\" Connie asked, peeking into a window but only seeing darkness. Mark scanned the porch before grabbing a pretty heavy flower pot, \"Watch out.\" Connie took a few quick steps back and out of the way as Mark lifted it and aimed at the window. \"Aaaah!\" He screamed out as he heaved it through the window, and Connie winced at the crashing sound it made. \"Be careful about the glass.\" Mark told her as he handed her a spare flashlight and climbed on through. Making his way around, being sure to search every spot possible, Mark kept praying that he wouldn't come across Jen laying here dead somewhere, \" Oh please.. don't be here dead, Jen.\" He whispered to himself. Connie remained downstairs, double-checking everything as Mark made his way upstairs toward the bedroom where he had seen them together before. When he opened the door, he shined his flashlight around inside before stepping in and something there on the floor by the bed caught his eye. A body? It certainly had the shape, which now panicked Mark. He ran over to it, but then breathed a sigh of relief- it was only a couple of big pillows laying in an arrangement that resembled a body. It was over now. He had finished his search of the place. There was no trace of Jen. He came back down the stairs now and headed for the door. \"Nothing...\" He told Connie, \" ...it's time.\" \"Time?\" Connie asked, confused as she followed him back to the truck. She got in, figuring they were leaving, but Mark only got in to reach over and pull something from the glove compartment. Whatever it was, he shoved it into his pocket and got back out. Connie got back out and stood by her door, watching Mark walk to the back of the truck and pull two gas cans out of its bed. \"Seriously?!\" She responded, a bit startled. \"Yes.\" He simply stated and headed back into the cabin. Connie sighed, but after remembering what Henry had done to their parents.. it suddenly felt fine and she even smirked. This was only fair. It was just too bad that Henry wasn't in there to burn too. Mark started in the upstairs bedroom, pouring gas all over the place before reaching into his pocket and pulling out what he had grabbed before - a book of matches. He struck one and threw it down, turning to go back downstairs after watching the whole room catch fire rather quickly. On his way down, Mark held a gas can upside down, leaving a trail behind him and again - he lit a match, which caught the entire staircase on fire now. He lit up all the rooms and ran out the front door back to his truck. Connie had been sitting and watching as each area went up in flames. She glanced over to Mark as he started the engine, and when he looked back, she smiled. He grinned. Putting the truck into drive, they now drove off to continue their search for Jen. xxx Henry had woken about a half hour after his attempted attack when a man had found him laying unconscious and shook him. \"Hey, dude, you okay?\" When he came to, Henry growled and shoved the guy away from him. \"Jesus! Excuse me for trying to help. Fuckin' ungrateful prick!\" The man yelled and left him. Henry was still a bit groggy but hurried out of the club and headed back home. The cool night air was filled with the scent of smoke and the closer he got toward his home, the stronger it was. Henry was within sight now and paused his steps. He could see it. His home completely engulfed in flames. He stood there, staring - his cold blue eyes narrowed. If facial expressions could kill, this would definitely be the one.[Chapter 18] During the drive, Mark's cell phone rang. When he saw that is was the same 'Unavailable' that Henry had been calling from, he growled. After hitting the answer button, Mark screamed into phone, \"Where is she?!\" \"You know, I'm surprised at you Mark. I didn't think you had it in you. Wait until I get my hands on Jen again. I'm going to make it slow...\" Henry teased, a sinister but amused undertone. \"Cut the bullshit Henry, I know you have her!\" \"Oh trust me, If I had her, you'd have stumbled across her dead body by now. I do wonder though, who this man is that's with her right now. They looked cozy at the club. I knew she was a slut.\" Mark hung up on him. \"What did he say?\" Connie asked, having watched him during the whole conversation. \"He's claiming Jen is supposedly with some guy at the club. We're going to check it out, just incase.\" \"You're not worried it's a trap?\" \"I don't give a damn. But you stay in the truck, just incase.\" \"Oh come on...\" \"I'm serious, Connie. Please.\" Mark pleaded, glancing over to her. Connie sighed in defeat and nodded, \"Fine.\" Once they arrived at the club, Mark wasted no time in rushing inside. Connie did as she was told and remained in the locked up truck. It was quite a busy night. The club was even more packed than when Jen and Castiel had been there earlier. Mark wasn't even on the dance floor and was already having to kind of push a way through people, apologizing to any he bumped. He had started heading for the bar, to see if maybe the bartender had seen Jen, but halfway there he paused. There were a couple of guys nearby who seemed to be arguing over some event that one of them had witnessed earlier. Guy 1: \"Dude, I'm telling you... this IS what I saw!\" Guy 2: \"Shut up. You're just too fucking wasted, man. You're seeing shit.\" Mark got a bit closer, hoping to hear them better. Guy 1: \"I'm telling you, someone upstairs was trying to kill someone down here! I saw a hammer fly toward this couple, but the guy stood up and froze it in midair just in time! Voodoo shit, dude, I'm telling you.\" The conversation ended there as the second guy broke out in laughter. \"Fuck you.\" The first guy responded, downing the last of his beer bottle now. \"Excuse me...\" Mark spoke up, approaching the men now, \"...sorry to butt in, but I'm looking for someone and I think the woman from this couple you mentioned might be her. Did she have longish brunette hair?\" The first guy nodded, \"I overheard the man she was with called her Jennifer at one point.\" \"That's her!\" Mark said hopefully, \"Did you happen to see where she went?!\" The second guy had settled down and was no longer laughing. He just stood and listened. \"That's the thing... I know this is going to sound crazy,\" the first guy began, then glanced over to his buddy, \"and this asshole here's just gonna' laugh again, but... they vanished.. into like fucking thin air!\" He was certainly right about his buddy. The laughter came again, even louder than before. \"Oh shut the fuck up.\" Guy 1 replied. Mark said no more. He turned and ran from the club. This was very bad. He didn't like the sound of this guy that Jen's with. Connie noticed Mark rushing back to the truck, \"Hey, what's up? What happened?\" After starting the engine, Mark looked over to her. \"A guy in there said he saw Jen, but I'm not liking the sound of this guy that's with her. Apparently he stopped a hammer in midair, which is good because at least it means Jen wasn't hurt, but then they vanished. Like magic.\" \"What? No way...\" \"We're heading back, I feel like checking again...\" xxx Back at Mark's place, Jen and Castiel now sat in the living room talking. \"Jennifer, there's something you should know. When I saw Henry back there, I felt something. A sense. He's not quite himself.\" \"Has he ever been himself? \" Jen asked, not understanding what Castiel was saying. \"No, what I'm saying is that there's something extra inhuman about him.\" She stared over at Castiel, head tilted curiously. He noticed this and continued, \"There's something about him. I think, at some point, he may have made a deal with the darkness.\" \"What does that even mean...?\" She asked, still just as confused. Castiel's mouth opened again, ready to answer until he suddenly paused and glanced toward the front door, vanishing afterward. \"What the...? Hello?!\" Jen was frustrated now at her angel's sudden unexpected exit and she stood from her seat on the couch, looking around until the sound of the doorknob being unlocked and turned caught her attention. Mark and Connie stepped in and looked to her, relieved. \"Jen! Thank god!\" Mark shouted and rushed over to embrace her. \"Sorry to worry you.\" Jen said softly as she embraced him back. \"What the hell happened? And were you out with someone? This guy at the club told me what he saw-\" Before Mark could finish everything he was going to say, there was that sound of wings flapping and his attention was now drawn to the figure standing behind Jen. Connie's eyes widened too. Castiel had reappeared and was choosing to be visible to them now. \"Hey wait a second... I remember you!\" Mark screamed angrily, \"It was you who knocked me out!\" Jen held both arms out at her sides, as if she was protecting Castiel, because Mark did look ready to make a move at him, \"Mark, listen...\" But her words would now be interrupted by the angel standing behind her, \"In all fairness, I think you did deserve it.\" Jen shot a glance of disbelief back at him. \"Excuse me?! Who the fuck are you?!\" Mark screamed, his anger almost at the limits now. Castiel vanished and reappeared behind Mark. At this, Connie backed away, putting as much distance as possible between herself and this. It was truly freaking her out. \"I am Jennifer's guardian angel...\" Castiel responded, now causing Mark spin around and face him, \"...who are YOU ? Where was your assistance to her after this girl attacked? You embraced the attacker, Jen was left in pain.\" That was it. Mark was fuming now. \"Oh you've got a LOT of nerve! Some guardian angel! Where were you when Jen was-!\" But Mark stopped himself, realizing Jen was still standing there behind them and it was probably best not to bring that up. He glanced back at her and noticed it apparently didn't matter. He stopped, but it still affected her because her eyes were now on the floor. Castiel shook his head, his whole tone now changing to regret and shame, \"You're right. I should've stepped in before that happened and prevented it. But there were rules, and I wasn't allowed at the time. There are things - sometimes awful - that need to happen... that are supposed to happen... that are meant to. I wasn't allowed to interfere.\" \" NEED to?! SUPPOSED to?! MEANT to?!\" Mark yelled, grabbing the angel by his shoulders and shaking him angrily with the next question, \"Tell me, what in the hell would make her deserve that?!\" Castiel just stood there, letting Mark handle him without a fight. \"Mark, stop. Let him go.\" Jen spoke up, finally looking to them again. \"Did you hear all this shit, Jen? He's supposedly your guardian angel, but he just stood by and let Henry hurt you!\" \"Let him go Mark.\" She requested again, and he obeyed but still glared at Castiel. \"Castiel, repeat what you were telling me about Henry.\" Brushing off his coat a bit, Castiel looked to Jen and repeated, \"Henry has darkness in him.\" \"That's nothing new, I've known that for the last fifteen years.\" Mark stated. \"This is different. i believe he made some kind of deal. Sold his soul.\" \"He had a soul?\" Mark asked, which normally would be a joke, but it was obviously serious in this case. \"Wait...\" He added, \"Is that how he's back?!\" \"Likely.\" Castiel said. \"This is all so weird.\" Connie spoke up, still at a distance. \"So what's the best thing we can do? If you know this about him, you must know a weakness or something we can use against him.\" Mark asked, determined to get as much info as possible. \"I didn't sense that he had any special powers. I believe he's still just a human.\" \"Well, that's a relief then.\" Jen sighed as she then started heading for her bedroom. \"Are you okay, Jen?\" Mark wondered. \"Kind of sick, just want to rest a while. Sorry.\" Mark only nodded, waiting for her to go in and shut the door before he whispered to himself, \"Why does she keep shutting me out?\" Connie frowned. She could tell even from a distance how troubled her cousin was right now. xxx Jen cut the light on and slowly and gently climbed into bed to lay down. She wasn't lying. She did currently feel pretty sick and exhausted. \"I hate this. I hate suffering because of what Henry did to me...\" And with those words, came tears. She sobbed a bit, softly. Castiel had appeared by her side again, of course. \"What if I told you I may be able to fix it?\" He asked, looking down at her with care in his eyes. Jen looked back up at him curiously. \"Would you let me?\" He added.[Chapter 19] Jen blinked, silent in thought as she stared back at her angel. What did he mean? Could he really \"fix\" it? And how? \"Jennifer...\" Castiel spoke up again, but softly. His head tilted, studying her expression which, to him, seemed hesitant and maybe even a bit worried, \"Don't be afraid.\" She shook her head in response, \"No. I'm not... I- I just don't understand. How would you help fix this?\" \"Well... I would do what could normally be done. Only, my way.\" He explained, but it still wasn't quite clear enough, as Jen questioned him again. \"Castiel, what are you saying?\" \"I can change it. I can end the pregnancy... in a way, kind of like...\" \"...an abortion...?\" Jen asked, finishing the sentence for him and he nodded his head. Jen looked away now, across the room, silent in thought once again. Now there was an inner struggle. A war waged inside. There was a part of her desperately screaming 'Yes! Please!', while at the same time, she felt so wrong for even considering it. Castiel placed a gently hand on Jen's shoulder, sensing her turmoil, \"It's alright Jennifer. You don't have to make this decision right now.\" She nodded, \" I do think I need some time.\" \"Which is absolutely fine. Now, get some rest.\" Castiel could tell how tired and unwell she really was. It wouldn't take long for her to drift off to sleep... Castiel's presence was soothing and she felt so safe and comfortable with him there. Once he was certain that Jen was sleeping soundly, Castiel teleported into the other room where Mark and Connie were, which startled her and caused her to jump, \"God. Can't you use the door like us normal people? It would give us more of a heads-up.\" \"I apologize.\" \"How is she doing?\" Mark asked, but refused to look at the angel. \"She's asleep now,\" Castiel told them, clearly noticing Mark's refusal to look at him, but he would just shrug it off. If Mark wanted to still be angry, that was fine, \"I told Jennifer that I can offer a solution, if it is her wish.\" This was the moment Mark chose to look back at him, his head whipping around quickly now in curiousity, \"What kind of a solution?\" \"I can offer a way to stop the pregnancy.\" \"What did Jen say?\" Connie asked, curiously. \"She is going to take a bit of time to think it over first.\" \"You should do it.\" Mark spoke up. Connie gasped, shocked at her cousin, \"Mark!\" \"What?! Do you think she should go through with this? And what about if Henry were to find out that Jen's pregnant?! He would have a ball with that!\" Mark approached the angel now and stood only a couple of feet away in front of him, \" You should fix this, it's YOUR fault after all! You stood idly by and did nothing to save her!\" Castiel narrowed his eyes, but remained calm, \"I can say the same of you. You were there. What did you do to help?\" Mark's eyes widened, shocked and ready to rage, \"Unlike you, I didn't know that's what was happening... you god-damn FAIRY!\" \"Hey, hey! That's enough! Stop your bickering, guys, you'll wake her up!\" Connie shouted, but trying not to be too loud and rushed over to get between them. Castiel stood calm the whole time, \"This decision is Jen's. And Jen's alone. I will be there to fix it only if it's what she truly wants. Do not try to persuade her against what she wants, or you will have me to deal with.\" \"Don't threaten me! It's insulting that you think I'd do such a thing! I've already told Jen that I support whatever she decides to do about it. So shut the fuck up!\" Mark fumed again. His buttons were seriously being pushed. He cared about Jen and couldn't believe the nerve of this guy. Castiel turned his back to Mark now, ready to go back in to check on Jen, but paused to speak one more time. \"I'm Jennifer's care-taker. Her real guardian. I know that you don't like me, and frankly, I don't care. You'll just have to accept me.\" This time, Castiel used the door and went back to Jen. Mark shook his head and took in a deep breath, letting it back out slowly. \"Relax Mark, please. You two are going to have to get along, for Jen's sake. She needs both of you.\" Connie told him as she took a seat on the couch again. He nodded, \"I know.\" Connie said no more, but deep down, she was starting to get a sense of what was going on and maybe even why her cousin was beginning to act this way. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX With his home now burnt to the ground, Henry had spent some time wandering through the forest in search of new shelter, all while plotting his revenge. Nothing exact yet, but one thing was - of course - definite... it was not going to be pretty. 'Hahahahahahahaha...' Laughter. Richard's laughter. Henry paused by a tree and looked all around him. No one was there. It was then that he realized it was only in his mind. 'Hahahahaha...' Now the laughter had an echo. And it would not stop. Henry growled and slammed his hands against the sides of his head, \"Shut the fuck up!\" Even more laughter. 'Hahahahahahaaaaaaa...' This was very agitating. Henry now slammed his fists against the tree, drawing blood and leaving some of the skin on his knuckles pretty raw. However, it did not phase him. He just collapsed to his knees, breathing heavily and holding his head. After another moment, Richard's laughter finally began to fade until Henry could no longer heard it. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Jen's peaceful slumber did not last long. Even though Castiel was now back in the room and at her side, a nightmare had begun: ~Her eyes opened. The room Jen was in was so bright white, it was blinding, so she closed them once again and started picking herself up off of the cold, hard floor that she had been laying on. Once she was on her feet, she could hear what sounded like like steps from tiny feet come rushing up behind her and stop. \"Mommy?\" It was the voice of a young boy. Perhaps a toddler. Jen opened her eyes and spun around. The room was no longer blinding, now it was pitch-black darkness, making it impossible to see the child. He spoke again, \"Mommy? Come play with me Mommy.\" \"Wh- What? What's going on?! Who are you?\" Jen spoke up and took a single step back though she still could see nothing. The child giggled, \"You funny, Mommy... come play... COME PLAY!\" Suddenly, as Jen looked downward, she could now see two small red eyes glowing through the darkness. Gasping, she tried to spin back around and run away but before she could, something slammed into her and knocked her backwards to the ground. Now it felt as though the child was climbing up her body - from feet to chest - where he froze and looked down at her. Those two creepy red eyes peered into hers as he spoke once again - only this time, with a deep demonic voice, \"I SAID PLAY WITH ME MOMMY!\" Jen was frozen. She could not move or even scream. The eyes got closer and as the face was only a couple of inches from her own, it lit up suddenly and was Henry's, eyes still red!~ There was now a release and she began to scream as she woke up. Castiel flinched a bit and put a gentle hand to her shoulder, which only seemed to frighten her more. \"No! NO! Let go of me!\" \"Jennifer, relax... you were dreaming!\" Castiel assured, trying his best to snap her out of this state. In two seconds, Mark had rushed through the door and into the room, yanking the angel away when he saw the hand on her shoulder. \"What are you doing to her?!\" Mark demanded to know as he slammed Castiel up against a wall. Connie ran in and went to Jen's side. Jen was now fully awake and aware that she'd only been dreaming as she looked at the two men now, \"Hey! It's okay-\" \"Damn it Mark, stop!\" Connie yelled. What happened next shocked the girls. Castiel was quite sick of Mark's attitude toward him lately, so he raised a hand and Mark went flying across the room and into another wall. He slid down and collapsed to the floor, dazed. \"Oh god...\" Connie gasped and ran to his side. \"Castiel!\" Jen shouted in disbelief. \"My apologies, Jennifer, but his temper is extremely out of control lately...\" The angel's eyes moved from her back to Mark, \"What has gotten into you? You need to pull yourself together. It's an insult to think I would ever hurt her.\" Mark said nothing after getting back up to his feet with Connie's help and he left the room immediately. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Author's note: Sorry for the 2-month delay, writer's block SUCKS. I feel this could've been a bit longer, but I wanted to go ahead and get something out. Hope you still enjoyed :) What are your thoughts on Mark's temper toward Castiel lately? Also, I'm still debating whether or not to have Henry find out about the pregnancy. Feel free to leave any input in a review or PM. Thanks for sticking with me![Chapter 20] Jen sighed, \"Okay... please go get him. I'd like to speak with him alone.\" Connie nodded and left to go after Mark. \"And I mean it. Alone.\" Her eyes now set on Castiel so he knew that she would mean him too. \"Jennifer, he seems a bit out of control lately.\" \"Castiel, please. He wouldn't do anything. I trust him just as I trust you. Let me have a word alone with Mark.\" The angel nodded without another word and vanished. Mark entered the room again about fifteen seconds later, and Jen wasted no time in speaking up, \"Mark, I understand you were worried, but it was only a nightmare and I'm sorry it got you so worked up. You need to understand something though... Castiel would never do anything to hurt me. He's my guardian angel. So please, calm down.\" \"I know, Jen. I apologize. It's Henry. I'm letting him get to me more than I should. I know I need to relax and I promise to do my best. Can you forgive me?\" She gave him a sweet smile, \"Of course. Now, let's all work together okay?\" Mark returned her smile and embraced her, \"You bet.\" He then took a seat next to her on the bed as she looked around and called out for Castiel and Connie to return. In only three seconds, the angel reappeared, followed by Connie who walked back in not long after. Mark stood from the bed and looked to the angel, \"I'm sorry for my behavior and would really like it if we can get along from now on.\" Though he remained weary, Castiel would not show it. He simply nodded and extended a hand, which Mark immediately took and nodded back as they shook. \"And, Castiel, I've decided...\" Jen spoke up, the smile on her face from seeing these two shake hands now fading. \"Yes, Jennifer?\" He moved to be closer to her side. \"Do it.\" Her eyes moved to look downward now in shame. \"Are you sure? Absolutely 100% sure, and all YOUR decision?\" Castiel asked, needing her reassurance as he placed a hand gently over hers. She nodded and looked to him again, \"100%\" Mark and Connie remained quiet, exchanging glances. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX After the brief encounter with Richard's ghost earlier, Henry had decided to head back to the tunnel and perhaps, for now, make that his temporary home. Sleep deprivation had really begun to take a toll because almost as soon as he reached his destination, he drifted off to sleep as he leaned against one of the concrete walls in exhaustion. However, this time would be much different. What was about to occur was very unusual, and a first for Henry... at least, as far as he could remember. There was a chill in the air. Colder than anything ever. Any place. And all Henry could see now was dark gray. \"What's happening? What's going on here?!\" He demanded to know. His body was now beginning to react to the extremely bitter temperature. Trembling hard, he was sure he was about to drop to the ground since his legs could barely handle it. Just then, two red eyes appeared a few away and whatever this was, it began to laugh. \"Welcome back to hell, Henry. \" \"Hell? What are you talking about? Hell would have fire, and people would be burning everywhere. Where am I?!\" \"Hahahaaa... you really don't remember then. You humans and your completely wrong views. Hell is quite the opposite from your tales. Anyway... don't you ever wonder, Henry, why it is that you can't remember anything in your life from the time your mother dropped you from the cliff to just five years ago?\" Henry now took a seat on the ground, shaking almost violently, \"So you had something to do with this...\" \"You had a home with us in hell for quite some time. And, after twenty years, we placed you back into the world as you are now. How you would've been had you never perished. Age, appearance, mental-state and all...\" the demon laughed, \"what can I say? We wanted more of your chaos. You're quite popular among us.\" Henry said nothing. He didn't quite know how to respond to this bit of news. Again, the demon laughed, finding it funny that someone like Henry could be reduced to silence. \"Oh come now...\" and as those words were spoken, the eyes came closer, now standing over Henry, but there was no visible body... just the creepy floating red eyes, \"I'll cut right to the chase. I'm here to offer you a bit of assistance . Wouldn't you like to be rid of that meddlesome angel that's hanging around Jen?\" This time, Henry perked up, eager to find out how, \"So there's a way, huh? To kill him?\" \"I can give you instructions on how to send him here to this dimension. We'd love to get our claws on him too... and TORTURE.\" Henry got back up to his feet, no longer trembling like he had been, and staring back now that he was eye-level with the demon. \"I'll do it. Tell me.\" \"THAT'S OUR BOY!\" the demon laughed once more, \"Once you wake from here, you will find some black seeds next to you on the ground. Take them to that secret well of yours, along with the heart of a deer. FRESH. Kill the animal yourself and carve it out. Drop the seeds in first, then the bloody heart, and chant these words five times: Inknam Sema Upton Ruu ... followed by this phrase three times: Dagrum Incene . After that, the angel will no longer be in your way... Hahahaaaaa!\" Henry nodded, smiling. \"Now... get to it.\" And as soon as the demon spoke those words, Henry's eyes opened and he was fully awake. Looking down at the ground, Henry spotted those black seeds mentioned near his feet and grinned, \"Time to work some magic.\"[Chapter 21] Henry would waste no time getting started. He scooped up the seeds, put them in his pocket, and headed into a nearby forest in search of a deer. Grinning, he was ready for this part. Though it would not be Mark or Jen or Connie, it'd still feel great to spill some blood. It was so overdue. He needed this. Making sure to be careful about his steps, he managed to avoid any branches and crunchy leaves that were in his path. It would suck if he were to alarm any deer that may be close by. 'Turn around...' That demon voice had spoken again, but only in his head. And when Henry followed the instruction, there, just a couple feet away, lay a baby deer. It was alive and seemed to be struggling to get back up on its tiny legs. Just a foot away from it, was a pocket knife. And when Henry spotted this, he smirked, \"Thanks.\" Killing again was going to feel so great, even if it was just an animal. Henry was certainly no stranger to that. As he knelt down to get a closer look, it was obvious that this fawn was injured. \"Oh... why you poor little thing...\" Henry spoke softly, but it was obvious sarcasm as he smirked. This was a fun sight to him and he began to circle around the animal, as if studying it carefully and pondering the best way to end it. \"Does it hurt, Mark\" He spoke again, now picturing this fawn as Mark writhing in pain at his feet. \"Good. I told you not to fuck with me. Stubborn Cuz.\" Henry stopped and knelt again, down at the fawn's back and actually leaned in now to whisper at its ear, \"I'll take good care of Jen, don't you worry...\" And with that, he plunged the blade deep into its back. It responded with a slight cry and soon quit struggling. Richard's ghost appeared again, but it was as if Henry could neither see nor hear him. Henry's eyes were fixated on the dead fawn as he began to carve out the heart. Richard stepped closer to his brother, making sure he was clearly in sight but still... nothing. Henry never acknowledged him. Blood poured out over Henry's hands, and as he dug them into the corpse, there was a new look in his eyes. Joy, interest, sheer pleasure and ecstasy. As he held the heart now, he smiled. This was the scariest one yet. It was sadistic. \"This. This is what I need to do to Mark.\" Richard looked on, now horrified. Henry still paid him no attention. He just held the fawn's heart carefully in his hands and walked off, headed for his well to complete the spell. It was time. That angel had to go. XXXXX The bedroom was silent for a few moments until Castiel nodded and spoke up, \"I'll need you to lie back, Jennifer.\" \"Is this going to hurt her?\" Connie asked, concern in her tone. And Jen looked to Castiel curiously as well. She had wondered herself, but didn't want to ask. The angel seemed to pause and think for a moment before answering, \"I've never done this before, but it is a delicate process. I can't promise that there won't be pain. There may be some discomfort.\" Jen nodded and took a deep breath as she waited. Mark walked to her side and took hold of her hand, \"Jen, are you sure?\" She only nodded again. \"If we're ready to get started, I'll need you to step back Mark.\" \"Be as gentle as possible.\" Mark told him before rejoining Connie on the other side of the room. \"Of course.\" Castiel responded, \"Also, Jen, this will likely leave you feeling drained. It's a life force being removed from you, after all.\" Again, she nodded as her eyes closed, \"I understand. I'm ready...\" \"I'll do my best to combat whatever pain you may feel...\" Castiel assured her as he had now held one hand up and over her stomach, palm down. At first, Jen could feel a touch of warmth go through her belly. It was as if someone had placed a heating pad on her or something. Then, a twinge, which made her already closed eyes shut even tighter Mark had took a step toward them again, worried, but Connie reached out and took hold of his hand to stop him. She shook her head as Mark now looked back at her. \"Trust him\" She whispered to her cousin. XXXXX Henry was halfway to his secret well now. Richard followed, not too far behind. He still went unnoticed. He was losing now and wasn't sure what to do. Henry's mind went over ways to deal with the three once that angel was removed. He'd fantasize about slicing Mark open and removing his heart, just like he'd done not long ago with that fawn. As for Jen, raping her again came to mind. Why not have that bit of fun once more before ending it for good? And Connie would pose no challenge to him. In fact, he'd probably off her first. get the easiest part out of the way. Sure, she had survived the fire... but he wasn't around. She'd not escape death so easily the next time with him there, he'd make sure of it. XXXXX Castiel's free hand now gently held on to Jen's as she had begun to show signs of being in pain. Her occasional whimpers were like knives stabbing at Mark. He wanted to be over there to stop it, but Connie had to remind him again that this is what Jen wanted. Connie was a bit teary-eyed herself, obviously affected too. Suddenly there was discomfort in the angel's head. Something was going down, he could sense it...but it would not interfere. He refused to let it. he needed to get this done for Jen. His discomfort was growing though, because it was at this moment that Henry was finishing up with the instructions from that demon. He was now chanting over the well at the exact moment Castiel was almost done completing this removal. Jen's eyes shot open. She could feel something wrong too. This power that Castiel was using gave her a brief sense of what her angel was going through, \"Castiel... something's happening...\" she whispered. He nodded. Quietly, he had now finished and immediately collapsed to the floor, coughing up blood. \"Castiel! What's happening?!\" Jen cried out, but she was too weak to even roll over and look down at him. Mark and Connie rushed to his side to assist but it was no use. It was as if some invisible force had him pinned to the floor. Too Strong. And then, the angel began to shake as if he was experiencing a seizure. \"Hey! Hey! Talk to me! What's going on?!\" Mark yelled, still trying to pick him up off of the floor. But then... *POOF* .. Castiel vanished. Connie gasped and her and Mark stared at one another in shocked silence. XXXXX Once the ritual was complete, Henry grinned. He had a sense that it was successful, \"Thank you so SO much, demon... I'll take care of the rest. Watch, and enjoy the show...\"[Chapter 22] \"Mark. Connie. What happened?!\" Jen called out, confused and worried. Mark stood at Jen's side now, taking hold of her hand, but Connie spoke up and answered before he could: \"Castiel vanished, and it seemed like something was hurting him.\" \"I knew I felt something strange.\" Jen replied. \"What do you mean?\" Mark wondered. \"I don't know exactly, but as he was using his power on me, I sensed something was going after him. Wait a sec...! It's all MY fault! What if this was some form of punishment for what he just did?\" Mark shook his head, \"No. Don't blame yourself, Jen. It's not your fault. We'll figure this out, you just focus on resting up okay? We'll get him back somehow.\" Connie grabbed Mark's arm suddenly and started pulling him along out the door, \"Excuse us Jen, sorry.\" Once out of the bedroom, Connie pulled the door shut behind them and spoke in a low tone, not wanting Jen to overhear and get upset, \"Mark, what are we going to do? Our best chance at beating Henry is gone.\" Mark frowned back at his cousin, feeling a bit insulted now, \"Oh, thank you, Connie. I'm glad you have such faith in me.\" \"No, no...\" Connie sighed, \"it's just... you know what I mean. Castiel had special powers.\" Before Mark could respond again, the door opened and Jen cut into the conversation. She had obviously been eavesdropping, \"Connie's right, Mark. Castiel had an advantage over Henry. He saved my life back at the club.\" \"Jen, what are you doing? You're supposed to be resting-\" Mark began, but Jen cut him off: \"It's strange. I feel amazing.\" \"But you're supposed to be resting. Castiel told us it was going to leave you drained.\" He added. Jen just shrugged. She wasn't sure how to explain it, but she felt rested and strong. Had Castiel done something different? \"Well, it's great that you feel recovered, but we should probably still be careful and keep a good eye on you. Just in case.\" Connie told her with a smile. \"Yes.\" Mark nodded in agreement. \"I know. I understand.\" Jen nodded as she now brushed past them and seemed to wander around aimlessly. Something was different. She could feel it. But what? Mark followed her curiously as she began to circle the living room. She wasn't saying a word either, which now had him concerned, \"Jen? What are you doing?\" She spun around to face him, but did not answer the question, \"Where's the nearest church?\" \"Um, there's one about eight miles south from here. Why do you ask?\" \"I have to try to fix things. This is my fault. I'm sure that whatever hurt Castiel and took him away was a result of my decision. I have to go pray. I have to try to apologize. He didn't deserve to be punished because of me...\" Jen explained, full of guilt. \"Jen, listen... it's NOT your-\" Mark began, but she then cut him off: \"It'd make me feel better.\" He sighed in defeat, \"Okay. If it helps you to feel better, we'll go tomorrow.\" Jen nodded, silent. But tomorrow wouldn't be good enough for her. She'd have to make her own plans. Mark just didn't understand. At around midnight that night, Jen peeked out from her bedroom door. The house was dark and quiet since everyone had gone to bed just an hour before. Mark was asleep on the couch because he had been letting Connie use his room. Jen crept past him, watching him the entire time and hoped to not wake him up. When she reached the front door, she carefully grabbed the truck keys that were hanging up on a nail in the wall. Before leaving, she whispered, \"I'm sorry\". Jen's guilt over Castiel was eating her up. She had to do this alone. It had been her decision alone , after all. And stealing Mark's truck like this was, of course, not helping her feel any better about things... but she had to get to that church. She had to try and fix this, if it was possible. XXX It would only take about ten minutes for Jen to arrive at the church and despite it being after midnight, there appeared to be some lights on inside, bot no cars around. There wasn't even a parking lot, so she pulled off of the road to park in the grass and walk. On her way to the entrance, Jen paused when she heard a twig-snapping sound in the distance, but as she looked all around her, there was nothing. Feeling a bit spooked, she rushed in now. Henry was watching from afar, grinning. \"Well, this ought to be fun.\" It had been his initial plan to deal with Connie first, but he'd take what he could get. He approached the entrance, but stopped a few feet away as he remembered the last time he stepped foot in one of these places: Flashback: It was on a Sunday, the week of his upcoming death at the age of 12. Him and his parents came together, minus Connie and Mark. Connie was still in the hospital recovering from the attempted murder, and Mark had refused to join them, so Wallace and Susan sent him to see Alice Davenport again. Henry became pretty physically ill from the moment they entered the church. He tried to brush it off and ignore it, which worked a little bit at first but as time went on, he could no longer fight. Susan glanced over at her son ten minutes into the service and noticed his face was almost ghost-white. \"Henry?\" Susan whispered, \"Are you feeling alright?\" . She then elbowed Wallace lightly to get his attention, \"Hun, I think Henry's sick.\" Henry looked up at them and shook his head, giving a small sweet smile, \"I'll be okay, Mom and Dad, just need to run to the restroom real quick. Don't worry.\" He stood and excused himself, leaving as calmly as possible until he was out of sight. Once his parents could no longer see him, he bolted toward the restroom and immediately collapsed in from of a toilet and let it all out. It was honestly the hardest he'd ever remembered puking in his life. He'd also sat there shaking for at least ten minutes afterwards. End flashback. Henry stared at the entrance, eyes narrowed. He certainly wasn't going to risk dealing with that shit again. Luckily, he'd brought reinforcements, and as he walked around to the side of the building now, one of his hands went into a pocket. Inside, Jen had taken a seat in the first pew and closed her eyes as she brought her hands together in prayer, \"Dear God, I pray for your forgiveness for my recent decision. And please forgive Castiel. He doesn't deserve to be punished. Punish ME, not him. Please. Don't punish him for my choice...\" Then suddenly, a voice shouted from outside and Jen's eyes shot open as she recognized it to be Henry. \"GRENADE!\" he had shouted. And five seconds later, one came crashing through a beautiful stained glass window that had depicted a guardian angel, landing just a few feet away from where Jen sat. \"Shit!\" She gasped and ran for the back exit as fast as she could. She had almost made it out, but it wasn't quick enough. The grenade exploded after four seconds and brought most of the church crashing down around AND on top of her. She survived, but was pinned down by pieces of the ceiling that had fallen on her back, and both of her legs now felt broken. Jen was trapped, helpless. Once the smoke cleared a bit and the debris was finished falling, Henry entered what was left of the building and found Jen not too far away, \"Oooh, that's gotta hurt.\" He taunted. \"You..son of..a bitch.\" Jen spat, her voice full of hatred and agonizing pain. Henry just smirked and began pulling the church pieces off of her quietly. \"What are you doing...?\" She asked. No answer. Once he was done, he placed a foot under her at the abdomen and pushed her over onto her back. Jen winced and a small whimper escaped her lips. Henry then crouched down until her was on top of her, now straddling her at the waist, \"This was just as easy as taking care of the precious angel.\" Her eyes widened. So it was HIM ! And she responded by swinging a fist up toward his face, but he quickly caught her by the wrist and wrapped his free hand around her throat, \"Now, now... that's not nice, darling.\" Jen gasped as his grip tightened and began to cut her air supply. Panic set in and she started trying to squirm despite her broken legs. Her free hand clawed at his arm and tried to pull his hand off her throat, but it was useless as she began to get weaker. Henry leaned in, his face just inches from hers, staring into her terrified eyes, \"What a beautiful thing... life slipping away... draining.\" Her fight weakened even more and he smirked, \"Say hello to my parents for me.\" Everything then went dark for Jen, her arms going limp as her eyes closed. Her body now lay lifeless. He won. For a moment after he let go, Henry remained on top of Jen and stared. He felt so high and smiled in pleasure. Finally , another life taken by his own two hands. After getting back up on his feet, he contemplated what to do with the body. Dump it in a lake? Ditch it deep in the woods for wild animals to feed? Both were tempting, but wait - an even better idea - he'd leave her by the road. Surely Mark and Connie would be out in search of her. What a great way to torture them. Henry laughed as he lifted Jen by the arms and drug her away from the demolished church and toward the road. Once there, he didn't just drop her, he threw her down at the edge and grinned as he marched off - victorious. And whistling in delight.[Chapter 23] \"Wake up. Get to Jen.\" It was a voice that Mark had never heard before, and it whispered into his ear. As soon as he heard this, his eyes shot open and he jumped off of the couch, making a dash for Jen's room, but when he opened the door, he noticed her bed was empty. He then glanced to the bathroom, but it was dark and empty as well. Mark was now in full-panic mode as he went over to look out the living room window. The truck was gone! \"Shit! Connie, wake up!\" Mark dashed to the bedroom door, yelling, \"Connie! Connie, get up!\" Frightened, Connie jumped out of bed and opened the door within five seconds, \"What? What's happening?!\" \"Jen's gone, and so is the truck!\" \"Wha-?!\" She began, rubbing her eyes tiredly as Mark spoke up again: \"I heard a boys voice. It told me to go to her, but she's gone!\" The voice that had spoken was Richard, but Mark wouldn't know this, of course. Mark now rushed for the front door, Connie not far behind him, \"Wait! Where are you going? We don't have the truck!\" \"I'm going to the church. Jen was asking about it. She's got to be there. You stay here, Connie, in case she shows up, okay?\" Mark was immediately out the door and running before he even gave her the chance to respond. XXXXX Light as a feather. Maybe even lighter than that. Could this be...? Jen \"woke\" in an empty room that was illuminated by a beautiful, shimmering silver color and in the distance, she could see a tall gate across a doorway. Was this... the gateway to heaven? She sighed as she came to the realization that she was dead, \"Oh Mark, I'm so sorry.\" Taking in a deep breath, Jen took a couple steps forward in the direction of the gate but then - POOF- ..it vanished. \"What the...- WAIT!\" Had she missed her chance to get into heaven? What was to happen to her now? The voice of a boy then spoke up from behind her, \"It's not your time to go, Jen.\" When Jen spun around to look at who was there, her jaw dropped. There was no question who this boy, who stood about a foot shorter than her, was. The resemblance to Henry was strong and obvious. \"You're him, aren't you? You're...\" \"Richard. Richard Evans.\" He finished for her. \"Richard. Oh wow...\" \"There's not a whole lot of time, Jen. I'm just here to let you in on what your angel, Castiel, did...\" But Jen shook her head, interrupting him, \"I know what he did, Richard.\" \"You don't know it all,\" He told her, shaking his head as well, \"but you need to. Having this information will help you defeat Henry.\" She nodded, \"Tell me.\" \"When Castiel was helping you, demons were hurting him and took him away. They'd given Henry a spell to get rid of him, and Castiel could feel how much trouble he was in, so he transferred some of his angel power over to you. That's why you recovered so quickly. Castiel wanted you to be able to take care of yourself in his absence. You just need to awaken these powers. Now, listen carefully...\" Jen's eyes had widened at this news, but she listened intently. \"Mark's about to find your body, and you'll be back with him soon. When you wake up, focus and place a hand or two on your legs. Focus hard. You'll be able to heal.\" Richard's image began to fade, but Jen called out and he paused before disappearing completely, \"Wait! Before you go... can you tell me if there's any way to save Castiel?\" \"That I can't tell you. I don't know. I'm sorry...\" And with that, Richard was gone. XXXXX Mark ran the entire eight miles until he finally arrived at what was left of the church, looking on in horror as he tried to catch his breath, \"What in the-?\" Pause. A body laying at the side of the road. \"No. No!\" He ran again and knelt down by her side, eyes widened in terror once he realized it was her, \"Jen! No ..no.. oh my god...\" He tried to feel for a pulse, but could find none. \"No, no, no... NO! Henry's not winning. I won't allow it.\" Despite still feeling a bit out of breath, he tilted Jen's head back slightly and leaned in to begin CPR on her. However, as soon as his mouth was just inches from hers, she let out LOUD gasp and her eyes shot open. Mark fell back, startled. Breathing heavily, Jen just lie there at first, staring up at the night sky. Mark fixed himself back into a kneeling position at her side, \"Take it easy, you're okay. Thank god. It's a miracle.\" He smiled and started to try to help her sit up, but Jen just shook her head as she remembered what Richard had told her to do, \" Give me a minute.\" There really was no pain in her legs, just numbness and an inability to move them. Jen took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and placed a hand on each of her thighs. Focusing as intensely as she could, she began to feel a wave of warmth flow from each palm and into her legs, traveling all the way down them. It was working! And she smiled once she realized they had healed and she could now move again, \"Okay. I'm good now.\" \"What happened here, Jen?\" Mark wondered as he now helped her sit up and then get to her feet. \"Henry. I was inside praying for forgiveness in hopes to get Castiel back, then he threw a grenade through a window and I couldn't escape in time. I survived but got pinned under the rubble and he strangled me. I'm so sorry for taking off in your truck, Mark, really sorry...\" \"Hey, don't stress over that now, I'm just glad to have you back.\" \"What happened to Castiel is Henry's fault. Richard just told me that demons gave Hen-\" Jen had begun to explain, but Mark interrupted in shock: \"You saw Richard?\" and she nodded. \"He said he was there to give me some information that will help us beat Henry, but unfortunately, he didn't know how we can get Castiel back. Demons gave Henry a spell to get rid of him.\" \"We'll figure out a way, don't worry...\" Mark assured her as he accompanied her back to his truck and Jen handed him his keys, \"..what's this information that Richard told you about defeating Henry?\" \"Well...\" She began as he started up the truck and drove them back. During the trip, she explained how she now had some of Castiel's angel power and mentioned being able to heal her two broken legs, but that she will still need to practice with this ability in order to find out what all she's capable of. \"This is GREAT . We'll definitely give him what he deserves now.\" Mark smiled eagerly. XXXXX Back at Mark's cabin, Connie sat on the couch waiting either for Mark to return or Jen to turn up. She was still pretty exhausted and ended up falling back to sleep, but only for a few minutes, because now a strange voice spoke into her ear and made her jump awake: \"Don't be afraid, sis.\" Her heart was pounding now, as she expected to see Henry standing over her or something, but as she scanned the room she didn't see anyone. She even got up and searched the entire place. No one. \"What in the world...\" XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Author's Note: I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I admit it was a little rushed toward the end because I just NOW finished it in order to meet my goal of having it up TODAY. I'm actually not fond of it, but meh. Life's been crazy lately, and I'm struggling to stay afloat by accepting all these extra work hours. Sometimes I only get one day a week off, which has affected my ability to work on this fic. I'm doing what I can though, so thanks for sticking with me. I'm leaving town for the weekend, so hopefully that will refresh me. All reviews welcome, as well as suggestions. Thanks! :)[Chapter 24] A brief flash of orange almost blinded Connie as she stood in the living room contemplating what had just occured. Mark had just pulled the truck into the driveway and was looking toward the window when it happened. He immediately got out and rushed inside, Jen close behind him. \"Connie! Are you okay? What the hell was that?!\" Connie stood silent, shivering in fear a bit. This was too much for her. \"Hey, hey, talk to me Connie. What just happened?\" Jen closed and locked the door behind them as Mark went over to tend to his cousin, who was now looking pretty spooked. Seeing that he was not going to get a response, he guided Connie toward the back door, \"Come on, let's get you some fresh air.\" Jen waited inside, figuring it was best to let Mark try to help Connie at the moment. Once she took a seat on the couch, Mark's cell phone, which he had left on the coffee table in front of her, began to ring. She stared at it for the first three rings, debating on whether or not to take it out to them. 'No...' Jen told herself, ' I'd better give them some peace. Connie needs him right now.' Instead, she grabbed it up to read the ID: Unavailable. \"Hmm.\" Perhaps it couldn't do any harm to at least take a message, so Jen then hit the answer button and placed it to her ear, \"Mark's phone, Jen speaking.\" Silence. \"Hello?\" Jen spoke again, but more silence followed until there was a click. The person on the other end had hung up. XXXXX Henry slid his cell phone into a back pocket and stared off into space, a mixed expression of confusion and annoyance on his face. How was it possible that Jen was alive? He had made damn sure she was dead. \"I guess I'll have to try harder next time. NOBODY makes me look like a failure. Nobody.\" Over the last few days, Henry had come across an old abandoned building on a dead side of town. It looked like it had maybe once been used as a storage warehouse or a factory, judging by the size. Whatever it had been, it was now serving as his new, temporary home. As he took a seat in the darkest corner of the spacious main room, he began to scroll through some local news sites on his phone when he came across one that quickly caught his attention. \"Oh wow, what an awesome coincidence. I know Mark is going to blame me for this, and I LOVE it. I'm going to thoroughly enjoy playing with their minds. Again.\" While reading over the entire news article, a demon voice broke the silence, \"Oh, Henry, we also have a juicy tidbit of information we're dying to tell you. Make us proud...\" Henry looked up from his phone, staring curiously into the two red eyes glowing directly in front of him , \"I'm listening.\" XXXXX Thinking nothing of the odd, silent phone call, Jen flipped the television on as she waited for Mark and Connie to come back inside. However, her focus would not be on the program currently airing - which was an old black and white Twilight Zone episode. Staring at a box of tissues sitting on a corner of the coffee table in front of her, she raised her left hand slowly, which caused the box to levitate. Jen couldn't help but chuckle and lowered her hand again, which set the box back down. After about five more minutes, Mark escorted Connie back inside and Jen sat up, looking to her with concern, \"Are you doing alright, Connie?\" The question was only met with a nod of the head, so Mark spoke up, \"I explained everything to Connie and when I told her about Richard, she mentioned a little experience she had right before we got here. He may have contacted her too.\" \"Really? What happened?\" Jen wondered curiously as she made room for them to sit down with her on the couch. Connie was still in a bit of shock, but had calmed down for the most part and spoke softly, \"I heard a 'Don't be afraid, sis'. Even though it didn't sound much like Henry, I still literally jumped up, expecting to see him standing nearby. This is all so strange.\" \"What was that flash of orange light, though?\" Jen asked. Connie just shrugged. \"I think we should all be extra careful, in case it was a sign of some kind.\" Mark told them. \"Oh, Mark, while you two were outside, your phone rang and I answered it even though it said 'Unavailable'...\" Jen began to tell him, but Mark quickly interrupted upon hearing this: \"Henry's been calling from 'Unavailable', Jen, why didn't you bring it out to me?\" \"I'm sorry. I didn't want to bother you guys. I know Connie needed you at that moment.\" \"What happened? What did he say this time?\" \"Well, there was no response when I answered. It was silent and then they just hung up.\" \"Huh. That might be good then, because I think if it were Henry, he'd have something to say.\" Connie and Jen both nodded in agreement. All of a sudden, the Twilight Zone episode that was playing was interrupted by one of those breaking news bulletins and Mark grabbed the remote control to turn up the volume. Male News Reporter: \"Breaking news just in on WXKN, we go live to Julie Patterson, who's on the scene of a Jeep CJ-7 that was discovered abandoned on a back road just off of Manor Lane. Julie?\" Julie Patterson: \"Thanks, Allen. Police tell us that earlier this evening, a passerby phoned them after discovering this vehicle on the side of the road with its door open and no one inside...\" Mark's eyes widened in horror as there was now a clearer shot of the jeep onscreen, \"That-That's my Dad's jeep!\" Julie Patterson: \"We've learned that the owner is 54 year old Jack Evans, but so far no one has come forward with information on what happened. Police will be continuing their investigation and we will update you once the clues start coming in.\" Connie's eyes began to well-up with tears, \"Oh my god. Uncle Jack.\" \"MotherFUCKER!\" Mark raged, startling the girls a bit. \"HENRY. Henry is behind this! I'll kill him!\" A gentle hand now rested on Mark's shoulder and he could feel himself calming. A soothing wave of peace seemed to be flowing through him. He looked at Jen, who stared back with reassurance in her eyes. Nothing needed to be said. Mark couldn't help but smile at her. She really was full of magic. *RING* There went Mark's cell again and when he grabbed it, he noticed the 'Unavailble' caller ID. \"Stay here, I'm going to take this in my room.\" Once Mark entered his room, he pushed the door closed behind him but it didn't go all the way and remained open in a crack. After taking a deep breath first, he finally pressed the answer button, \"What?!\" He knew exactly who it was, so no need to answer normally. \"Marky-Mark, what's shakin'?\" \"Where's my Dad, Henry?!\" \"Uncle Jack? Hmm, that's an excellent question. Would you care to take a guess?\" \"I swear to god, if you've done something to him...\" \"I'm willing to make a deal with you, Marky. I won't hurt Uncle Jack, as long as you agree to my terms.\" \"What terms?!\" Mark growled. \"I want Jen. Alone. Send her to 4171 North Bailor Street. Or else.\" \"You really think I'm just going to send her off to you? No fucking way!\" \"Let me make this clearer for you, Mark. Either send Jen, ALONE, to the address I just gave you... or say goodbye to Daddy. And you know I'm not playing. Deal?\" Mark gritted his teeth, doing his best to hold back from flying into a rage and screaming, \"Don't you fucking DARE hurt my Dad.\" \"It's simple really. Just send her off in your car and I'll let her give him the keys so he can come home to you. Now, I'm not asking again after this. Do we have a deal?!\" Jen spoke up from outside the doorway, after having overheard that Mark's father was involved, \"I'll go.\" \"Ah, good girl. You have ONE hour.\" Henry grinned and hung up the phone. Mark screamed in frustration and threw his phone onto his bed before turning to face Jen, who had now opened the door all the way, \"Jen, please. I can't let you go to him.\" \"Mark, are you forgetting I have these angel powers? I can do this. let me save your father.\" \"But I-I just...\" Mark began, stuttering in confusion. He put both hands to his head, gripping hair in each fist, \"GOD DAMN IT!\" Jen jumped back as Mark then slammed a foot into the side of his bed and grabbed the lamp to fling it across the room. \"Hey, hey. Relax. Please...\" Jen told him, making her voice as smooth and soothing as possible, in hopes to help him calm down, \"Where does he want me to go? I can do this.\" \"Jen...\" Mark started to protest again, but she shook her head. \"Please have faith in me, Mark. Give me the address.\" Mark sighed, \"4171 North Bailor Street\" Jen nodded and started to head for the front door when Mark stopped her by taking hold of her arm. She paused to look back at him. \"Despite the powers you have, PLEASE be careful. You can never know what you're getting into when it comes to Henry. Please, PLEASE, promise me you'll watch out.\" \"I know, Mark. I promise.\"[Chapter 25] It was about a fifteen minute drive before Jen arrived at the address Henry had given. After putting the truck in park, she just sat there at first, trying to examine her surroundings but it was just too dark and quiet. There wasn't even a single working street light. The only light at the moment came from the headlights and Jen considered leaving them on, but no, it'd be best to not risk Mark's truck getting stolen by some other lunatic that could be lurking nearby (besides Henry). After taking a deep breath to try and help calm her nerves, Jen cut the engine off and got out. Moonlight did offer some visual assistance, but just barely. While keeping an ear out, she couldn't help but shiver, but not from cold. The temperature was a comfortable 65 degrees after all. No, it was from the silence. Dead silence. This abandoned part of town was NOT a place you wanted to be at four o'clock in the morning. As Jen found the entrance and entered, she remained quiet. Pitch-black. After a few more steps inside, Jen paused when Henry finally spoke up, but in a very creepy sing-song, \"Body in the dissssstance, bleeding out so pure... come dance with me on willows, and watch the weeping lure...\" Jen could feel her heart beginning to race and wished she could see. His voice had a slight echo throughout the room, making it difficult to determine his location at the moment, and then, his eerie singing continued... \"I hear you taste a'plenty, laying on death's door...\" \"Okay, Henry, enough!\" Jen shouted, her own voice also echoing. \"...so cry, and scream, and struggle... my makeshift little whore.\" His singing finally ended, and Jen desperately tried to see anything . \"Welcome, lovely.\" \"Okay Henry, I'm here. Now, keep your end of this deal and let Mark's father go.\" She felt a bit shook-up, but still managed to keep anxiety out of her tone when she spoke. He was going to pull something. She just knew it. But what? \"If only I knew where he was.\" His response sounded sincere, but Jen wasn't buying it and she shook her head, \"No. No games, Henry. Let him go!\" \"Oh, trust me,\" He laughed, \"I'm not playing this time, dear, I really don't know where my Uncle Jack is... but it's awfully convenient, don't you think? I love that he's missing. It was a perfect way to get you here.\" \"You're lying.\" Henry shrugged his shoulders, which would remain unseen of course. XXXXX Mark paced around the living room, saying nothing, even though it was obvious he wanted to speak up. He looked conflicted and confused. Connie was seated on the couch and had been watching him the entire time, \"Mark, have a seat already or something. You're starting to make me dizzy.\" \"I'm a fool, Connie. I'm such a fucking fool. I shouldn't have let her go alone! What the hell was I thinking?\" \"You agreed to have faith in her. Remember, Jen has the angel powers now. Henry's sure to be no match for that. Please, sit down!\" \"I hope you're right.\" XXXXX \"So, my darling Jen, I think you and I should have a nice, long chat. Let me start off with a true story... Er... confession, if you will.\" Jen remained silent, but still kept a careful ear on her surroundings. For now, Henry didn't sound like he was close-by. \"Do you remember that Halloween when you asked me about the stain on the living room carpet, and I told you I had just mixed up some fake blood for a costume and accidentally spilled it?\" Jen felt a bit confused and wondered where he could be going with this, \"And I said it was an awfully big stain for just a spill. You told me because it was a bucket...\" Henry laughed, \"Right. And you believed me too. Old gullible Jen. Want the truth?\" Panic set in now. It was pretty easy to guess what he was about to tell her and she gave no response, which only made him laugh again, \"Well, do you remember that crazy old homeless woman? What was her name - Ernestine-something, I believe?\" \"Ernestine Petty. Y-You killed Ernestine Petty?\" \"Didn't you ever wonder why we never saw her again after Halloween?\" Jen's stomach twisted and she was now on the verge of sobbing. Henry had killed someone, in their own home, and she never knew. \"I-I guess I just figured, and hoped, that maybe she'd gotten some help... or found a shelter.\" \"Now, now. Don't cry. It's obvious I did the bitch a favor. No one would come for her. No one cared. She was pathetic.\" \"You don't take someone's life and call it doing them a favor!\" Jen shouted, half crying and half angry. The mixture of emotions swirling around inside of her - shock, anger, panic, distress, and disgust - they were almost too much to bear and her already twisted stomach felt knotted-up even more. She raised a hand to cover her mouth as a sudden wave of nausea hit, causing her to gag. Luckily, that was all. Laughter from Henry echoed in the darkness around her. Jen took a deep, shaky breath when the feeling began to fade and she shook her head, speaking up again, but faintly, \" Why?\" \"Why? Because I can. And because you DO NOT fuck with Henry Evans.\" \"What are you talking about? What could she have ever done to you?!\" \"Screaming obscenities and threats. A big no-no. I don't know who the fuck she thought she was, but I took care of it. Thanks for cleaning that up, by the way.\" If not for the dark, Jen would have seen an amused and sinister grin on Henry's lips. \"Oh god...\" Jen flashed into the memory again. Henry was right. She had told him not to worry about the mess and offered to clean it herself. It had been a very difficult task, but she thought nothing of it because she'd heard fake blood was a pain to wash out. \"You know, that almost makes you an accomplice. How's it feel, Jen?\" \"Well I'm NOT. I had no knowledge of your crime, you sick fuck! Tell me something... what about Richard? What could your innocent little have done that was so terrible?!\" Henry gave her an unseen smirk, \"Quite interesting of you to ask, since I'm about to make YOU pay for the same reason.\" Jen's anxiety flew through the roof and she took a step backward, despite not knowing exactly where he was, \"What do you mean by that?\" \"Little Richie stole something of mine. And you DO NOT take what belongs to me.\" \"I didn't take anything from you!\" Jen argued, appalled that he would kill his baby brother over such a thing. \"No? Oh. Wait. I guess I should rephrase that. Destroyed. Is that better? You DESTROYED something of mine, which honestly, is much worse.\" \"i don't know what you're talking about, Henry! I didn't take or destroy anything of yours.\" \"Oh no?\" \"No!\" \"I know that you were pregnant.\" Jen stood in stunned silence, flabbergasted. How in the world? And as if Henry could read her mind, he answered, \"A little demon told me. Part of the same demons torturing that precious angel of yours. And you... well... I'm taking matters into my own hands.\" \"Henry...\" Jen spoke up finally, \"...it's not like that was an easy, sudden decision. I'm not so heartless, even though you raped me.\" She knew this attempt to reason with him would be unsuccessful, but she had to give it a shot anyway, \"It was extremely hard, and even now it still bothers me. It took me a lot of time to consi-\" \"Save the speech, Jen,\" Henry interrupted, \"it's not going to help you.\" \"It's not even something you would have wanted.\" \"Doesn't matter. Point is... it was MINE.\" At the sound of feet shuffling, Jen braced herself. Henry circled her now, but still from a distance. For at least three minutes, neither one of them spoke. Jen remained still, standing her ground and trying to listen for how close he was. And suddenly, another sing-song. More lyrics that sent chills down Jen's spine: \"Bleed out, bleed out... you're numb at my feet... newly divided... honey-suckle treat.\" \"You've seriously lost your mind.\" Jen whispered, her heart now racing in fear. This new behavior of Henry's was quite terrifying. The sound of shoes shuffling occurred once more before everything went silent again... and then, for a split second, Jen could tell someone was standing right next to her. Before she had the chance to react, a fist slammed into her cheek with enough force to knock her off of her feet. Immediately upon hitting the ground, Henry threw himself on top of her, rolling her over onto her back as he attempted to strangle her once more. \"You don't EVER destroy something of mine and get away with it! EVER! This time I'll make sure you stay dead!\" It was now or never. Jen extended an arm out from under Henry and, with the flick of her wrist, he went flying off of her. The sound of a THUD soon followed and confirmed that he had hit a wall on the other side of the room. She then scrambled back up to her feet and rushed toward the door, but froze at a sudden noise which came from the direction Henry had landed. Keys jingling. \"You won't get far, darling.\" Jen felt her pockets. They were empty. Henry had managed to steal the truck keys from her. Author's Note: The first song that Henry sings was inspired by \"O Willow Waly\" by Isla Cameron. It's a song I find really creepy, but still cool. If you haven't heard it, search Youtube and give it a listen. My original plan was to have Henry sing \"O Willow Waly\", but I decided to write my own creepy little tune and Henry sings it in a similar manner. Also, apologies for the almost 4-month delay! I will be working on part 2 and hopefully it will not take as long as this chapter did. Please leave me a review and give your honest thoughts on this chapter. I did my best :) Thanks for reading![Chapter 26] \"I'm impressed.\" Henry began as he got back up to his feet, \"It seems that angel gave you some power. Well, I guess now you have meaning.\" Jen clenched a fist in anger. Her mind raced as she desperately tried to figure out what to do next. Run? No, it'd be easy to get lost without the use of headlights. Plus, what if Henry really did have Mark's father and was just lying about it? This damn pitch-black darkness! If she could see, she'd be killing him right now. \"However, it's kind of unfair now, don't you think? But hey, what the hell... I've got friends with power too.\" And with the snap of his fingers, two red eyes appeared just inches away from Jen's face. She quickly raised a hand, but it was too late. Her body was lifted and thrown, like a rag doll, across the room by a force much stronger than hers. Jen collided with a wall face-first and immediately dropped to the floor on her side. She remained conscious, just a bit dazed. The demon had no problems seeing in the dark as it only took three seconds to be hovering over her once more, and as Jen threw up a hand in yet another attempt to defend herself, her power was met with resistance. It was like when two magnets repel each other if placed close together. A power struggle. The demon was testing her. She raised her second hand now, struggling to win. Henry gave a light sigh from boredom as he pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and lit one up. Demonic laughter echoed through the room as it began to feel Jen's power give way, \"Too eassssy..\" it spoke up on a snake-like voice, \"She basssically hass the equivalent of a magician at sssomeone'sss birthday party.\" Despite her best effort and using as much strength as possible, Jen's energy began to dissipate under the weight of the demon's. \"Without full angel magic, you're nothing againssst usss, girl.\" The demon hissed as it lifted hr up once more and pinned her against a wall. Jen struggled to move but it had become useless. She was now completely overpowered. \"Now, let'sss sssee what I can do here...\" The demon added, poking a sharp claw against Jen's left side, causing her to flinch. But what came next was even worse - that claw extended, piercing her flesh. It felt like a long needle was going through her body. Completely through. And out the other side. An agonizing scream echoed through the room and Henry smirked. Music to his ears. It was just a shame he couldn't watch. \"Don't kill her,\" He spoke up, pausing to take a puff of his cigarette before continuing, \"I'd like that pleasure. Again.\" The demon grinned, keeping its eyes on Jen as its razor-sharp fangs shined through the darkness, \"Jusssst make ssssure it'sss permanent this time, boy.\" Henry took offense. Boy?! Hardly. \"I damn well will, and DON'T call me 'boy'.\" Jen was weakening. The needle-claw was actually draining the powers from her, and as a result, her body started to go limp. \"I think I'm about done here...\" The hold on Jen was released and she dropped to the floor. \"You can go now. I'll take it from here.\" Henry stated as he walked in their direction. A snap from the demon's fingers made a light appear on the ceiling. And as soon as it did, he'd vanished, leaving Henry to finish with her. \"Hello, darling.\" Henry smiled as he reached Jen's side and used a foot to roll her over onto her back, \"Are you awake?\" She was. Just barely. No response. Having all that power taken from her so suddenly left her in a bit of a daze. Henry took one more puff from the cigarette and sighed as he squatted down next to Jen. \"Wakey, wakey.\" He taunted as he lifted her left arm and pressed his half-smoke cigarette against her skin, smiling at the sound of sizzling flesh. Jen was jolted out of her daze. A pain-filled shout, followed by an unsuccessful swing at Henry's face with her free arm, which he caught, showed that she was finally coming back to her senses. \"There's my girl.\" Henry laughed and yanked her up to her feet, immediately pinning her against the wall. Knowing that struggling to free her arms would be useless right now, since she still felt a bit weak, Jen wasted no time in lifting a knee up and striking him right between the legs. \"FUCK!\" Henry screamed, doubling over a bit. Jen squirmed when she felt that his hold had loosened and she managed to free her right arm, which she quickly swung - slamming a fist into Henry's eye and blackening it. It also sent him staggering backward and falling to the floor, one hand over his groin and groaning in pain. Sweet victory. Sort of. Jen wanted to stand there and bask in the sight of Henry writhing on the ground, but knew she better act fast and get the hell out of there or something. She sprinted toward the door, but Henry reached out and grabbed her ankle, bringing her down face-first to the floor. Before she had a chance to get herself back up, Henry was on top of her, pinning he down from behind and grabbing a fistful of hair. He pulled her head back roughly and spoke right up against her ear, \"This is the feistiest I've ever seen you. I like it. It's a shame this has to end.\" Henry reached into his back pants pocket and took out a folding utility knife, flicked the blade open, and pressed its sharp point against Jen's right side, \"If I push hard enough, do you think blood will shoot across the room? That sure would be something.\" His tone was full of glee, taking sick pleasure in this situation. He was just about to test it out, but suddenly paused and lost his grip on the knife. As it dropped to the floor next to Jen, Henry jumped up to his feet and put both hands to the sides of his head, screaming, \"WHA-WHAT THE FUCK!?\" After picking herself up off the floor, Jen backed away in confusion and fear. What was happening? Henry dropped to his knees, hanging his head, and screaming at the top of his lungs in what sounded like both agony and rage, \"WHAT'S HAPPENING?! WH-WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING TO ME?!\" He shot Jen a glare, but she only stared back in shock. It looked as though Henry was about to get up and charge at her, but one final movement - a fall forward to his hands and knees - seemed to be the end of whatever was happening to him. Calmly now, Henry sat back up on his knees and held both of his hands up in front of his face. His head tilted as he stared at them without saying a word. \"Okay, what of game are you playing now?\" Jen finally spoke up, unsure of what was happening, but convinced he had something up his sleeve. Henry pushed himself back up and into a standing position, though he seemed to sway just a bit at first. He looked to Jen, but in a completely new way. There was something different about Henry. His expression had now changed as he approached her, and once he was close enough to truly look into her eyes, there was a slight twinkle. It was then that Jen knew. She could see it. \"Ri- Richard?!\" The familiar, kind smile that followed was confirmation enough. Richard had managed to possess Henry. (chapter end). AUTHOR'S NOTE: I don't really have a good opinion about this chapter. I kind of feel like it's a mess, but hope you enjoyed it. Also! I'd like to wish Phorosz a very HAPPY BIRTHDAY tomorrow and thanks again for all your support! I hope you have a great day :)[Chapter 27] \"Is it ... is it really?!\" Jen was at least ninety-percent positive, but still watched him carefully. She had a right to be hesitant. When it came to Henry, you could never be sure. He was all about messing with people through mind games, after all. Richard nodded, \"It's me, don't worry. I've got him... for now. I'm surprised I had the strength to do this.\" He extended a hand out to her, \"It's me. Richard. Trust me.\" Jen reached out and took his hand as she began to feel less nervous, \"So, what's currently happening to Henry? I mean, does he know you have him? Will you be able to keep him suppressed long?\" \"I'm not exactly sure what's happening to him, but I don't think he knows I'm in him. He doesn't seem to be fighting it at the moment. So, it may be a sort of deep sleep or coma. As for how long I can keep control... I don't know, so it's important I do what I'm here for... quickly.\" Jen tilted her head, \"What is it that you're here for?\" \"I think I can help save Castiel.\" Jen's eyes widened at this news, \"Really?! That's wonderful! How?\" \"Well, Henry's got some sort of connection with the demons. I'm here, basically in his head. I might be able to search his thoughts and find out if there's a way to free Castiel. There's no hundred-percent guarantee, but I think it's worth a try.\" \"Could that be dangerous?\" Jen asked, uncertain about Richard's plan, \"What if the demons feel something wrong? What if they're alerted because of the conne-\" \"The first thing I did,\" Richard interrupted, trying to reassure her, \" is set up a kind of block as soon as I realized I was successful in possessing my brother. At the moment, the demons still believe that you're weakened and that Henry is torturing you. I can feel them, but not him. So, I can't guarantee I'll be able to stay in control as I dig through his thoughts. In fact, I might be opening up a doorway for him to come back.\" With that, Richard reached into a back pocket and retrieved the truck keys for Jen, \"You should probably grab that knife too. Just in case.\" She nodded as she took the keys and then picked up the folding utility knife that Henry had dropped. \"Okay. Be ready. I'm going to start now.\" Richard closed his eyes and focused hard. Jen watched him, remaining alert for anything that could go wrong. Breaking into Henry's thoughts was surprisingly easy, but Richard was not quite prepared for what was to come. Every single one of Henry's memories came along with this attempt, and as the memory of Henry drowning him in the bathtub flashed through his mind, Richard gasped and swayed a bit. For a moment, it looked like he was going to collapse to the floor, but he managed to keep his balance. Jen took two steps back, her grip on the knife tightening. She was nervous, but ready. Richard now began to shake as Henry's memory of setting fire to the hotel and causing their parents deaths played. \"Richard? Are you okay?\" Jen began to worry, but still kept at a distance. He didn't respond. Instead, he finally collapsed to the floor on his hand and knees, breathing heavily. Jen watched from a few feet away, \"Hey...\" This was proving to be too much for him to handle, and as soon as she went to take a step forward, he seemed to calm down and look back up. Frozen in her step, Jen now studied his face carefully and waited. Was he still Richard? Or had Henry found his way back? AUTHOR'S NOTE: I'm so sorry that this chapter is short, but I wanted to get something else out since it had been a little over 3 months. I am hoping it won't be such a long time for the next chapter. Hope you enjoyed it anyway. Have a safe and happy HALLOWEEN tomorrow! :)[Chapter 28] Silence. Jen stared at 'Richard' with uncertainty. She wanted to ask him if he was okay, but knew that wouldn't be a good idea - incase it was actually Henry this time. \"Um...\" It was all she could let out as her fist tightened around the knife handle. \"I-I'm okay. I've still got him...\" He finally spoke as he slowly got back up to his feet. \"Are you sure you're alright? What just happened?\" \"Memories. Horrible visions. My death ... my parents ...\" A tear came to his eye as he shook his head, \"...awful stuff. I wasn't prepared for all this, but, I'm okay.\" \"I'm so sorry, Richard.\" \"I'm sorry too, Jen. I saw more...\" Visibly cringing, Jen just shook her head. She knew what he meant, and did not want to think about that again, \"I know. Let's not revisit that. Focus on helping Castiel.\" \"Right.\" He nodded, \"I'm going to take a break and try again in a bit. In the meantime, you should get back to Mark before he worries much longer.\" \"Richard, you need to come with me.\" But he shook his head at the suggestion, knowing what a mistake that would be. Mark would take one look at him and that'd be the end. \"No. That's really not a good idea. Jen, you know how Mark would react the second he lays eyes on me.\" \"When we arrive, I'll go in first and handle it. It'll be fine, trust me. Come on, Richard, please go with me.\" Richard sighed, taking a minute to give it some thought. \"I'll go. But if anything goes wrong on the way there, like I start to feel Henry coming back, pull over immediately and let me out of the truck.\" Jen nodded, \"Got it.\" The drive back to Mark's place went smoothly. So far, Richard had no issues remaining in control of Henry. On the way, Jen discussed the plan with him. She would go inside first and explain, then signal for him to come in, once it felt safe. Despite feeling hesitant, Richard nodded. He truly hoped that Mark would believe it and trust in him. Connie too. He was looking forward to seeing his sister again. As the cabin came into view, Richard couldn't help but sigh. He was nervous, because of Mark. Jen shook her head and tried to reassure him, \"Don't worry. I've got this under control. You just stay here until I wave for you.\" At the sound of a vehicle approaching, Mark literally ran over to the window, \"God I hope that's Jen with my Da- ...oh shit.\" \"What?! What's going on?\" A startled Connie joined him at the window, immediately gasping when she realized what was wrong. Mark's truck parked close enough to the cabin for them to see two figures inside. One was indeed Jen, but Jack was nowhere to be seen. It was Henry. Rage. Mark was ready to SNAP. \" Stay inside, Connie. I think it's some sort of hostage situation. I'll handle it.\" He was out the door before anything could be said in response, slamming it shut behind him... \"HENRY!\" Jen was already half-way out of the truck once she saw Mark storming out toward them & quickly tossed the keys to Richard, \" Shit. Keep the doors locked!\" He nodded and did so after she closed her door. \"Mark, stop! I need to talk to you.\" \"Jen, what's going on?! Why is Henry with you?! Are you in danger?\" Jen was now directly in front of Mark and placed both hands on his shoulders to stop him in his tracks. It worked, but not before he screamed over her shoulder, \"GET OUT OF THE TRUCK, MOTHERFUCKER!\" \"Calm down Mark. I know this is going to sound crazy but trust me, that is not Henry. It's Richard. He managed to possess him.\" Mark just scoffed and attempted to go toward the truck, but Jen grabbed onto his arm before he could get past her, \"Mark, LISTEN TO ME! I'm serious! That's NOT Henry!\" He spun back around to face her as she held onto him, \"Jen, are you insane?! This is exactly the kind of shit he'd pull !\" Jen was very displeased now and pulled him back once more as he tried to go again. \"I could see it in his eyes, damn it! And DO NOT call me insane! Get back in there and calm down! We all need to talk.\" She even shoved him, just a bit, in the direction of the cabin. \"I'm so fed up with you right now.\" Mark was taken aback by her behavior and forced himself to seem calm, but he was still fuming inside. They just stood there now, staring at each other in awkward silence. After a minute, Jen spoke up. \"Now, will you PLEASE listen to me and step inside?\" Mark stood there, speechless and frustrated. Why in the hell was she defending him? The Richard story was bullshit. It had to be. To him, this was just another game. Something Henry did best. \"Jen-\" \"I said GO INSIDE.\" But Mark protested, still trying to keep his cool, \"I want him out of my truck.\" \"if I have to say it again, I will drag you inside myself...\" Jen spat. His eyes widened in shock, \"What is with you?!\" \"You heard what I said and basically called me a liar. That doesn't sit well with me. Have some faith in me, Mark! And if you want to get over there to the truck to hurt RICHARD, you have to go through me...\" Jen had taken a couple steps forward and was almost completely in Mark's face, \"...are you gonna do that?\" Mark stared at her in horror and, with a sigh, threw up his arms and turned to leave. He'd never hurt her, of course. Finally, he headed back into his cabin, but not silently. He began muttering a bunch of curse words under his breath as he did so. Jen turned to look back at Richard and held up her index finger as if to say 'give me a minute' before following Mark inside.[Chapter 29] Once they both were inside, Mark turned toward Jen again. \"Wait! My Dad. Where is he? Please tell me he's alright.\" \"Henry never had him. He lied. It was a trap. I'm so sorry, Mark.\" Mark began to freak out, panic and fear apparent in his now raised voice, \"Then where is he?! What's happened to him?!\" \"Don't worry, Mark, we'll figure this out.\" Jen had tried to reassure him. Connie nodded in agreement, \"We will. And I'm sure Uncle Jack is okay. He can be pretty resourceful.\" \"In the meantime,\" Jen began as she headed back to the front door, \"Richard needs to come in and explain something very important. Please don't be startled... and DO NOT hurt him.\" The first part of that had been directed at Connie. And the second, obviously, at Mark. \"Richard? Seriously?\" Connie was taken by surprise and confused, \"Seriously?\" Jen nodded, \"I swear, Connie. I could see it in his eyes. Trust me.\" Connie had no response. She really didn't know what to think or say to this, but gave a slight nod anyway. \"Jen-\" Mark began, but was quickly interrupted. \"Mark, I am not getting into this with you again. Promise me.\" He just sighed and turned away before responding, \" Fine.\" \"PROMISE me, please.\" \"I promise.\" \"Alright...\" Jen opened the door and now waved for Richard to come in. Mark watched silently and took a deep breath as Richard entered the cabin. He could feel himself desperately wanting to spring and attack, like a vicious animal, but no - he had to hold back. He had made a promise to Jen, who had now turned her attention back on him, watching him carefully. Richard kept at a distance from his cousins, not wanting to scare or provoke anyone. There was an obvious tension in the air. Despite this, he spoke up. There was much to say. Tell, actually. And that is when he turned his attention to his sister, \"Connie, before I get into the main reason I'm here, I just want to answer your questioning.\" Connie, who had stood furthest from him, stepped closer until she was right next to Mark, \"Wh-What are you talking about?\" \"There was nothing you could've done. So, don't be sad, okay sis?\" \"I don't understand. What are you-\" \"There was nothing you could have done to save me...\" Richard interrupted, in a soft brotherly tone with true sincerity. Connie's eyes went as wide as they could go and she opened her mouth to speak, but could not seem to get the words out, \"Wha- I- uh... How- wh-\" \"You never told anyone you had those thoughts, but I could hear you loud and clear. It's okay sis. I want you to know it's okay. Please stop regretting and don't blame yourself.\" Connie burst into tears. It was true. She had wondered for so long if somehow she could have prevented Richard's death. If only she had been there. She had put some blame on herself, but NEVER told anybody. Mark put a comforting arm around her as her cries got more hysterical. \"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!\" Richard felt terrible for being the cause of this breakdown, but he knew he had to prove himself, \"And Mark...\" Mark's eyes met Richard's, but there was still anger in them. It was obviously going to be tougher to convince Mark, but he had to give it a shot, \"Mark, in one of your appointments with Alice Davenport, you told her you let someone die. This is not true. You did not let your Mom die.\" For a moment, it looked as though Mark was amazed, but no - he needed more. \"Okay, Richard ...\" Mark sneered, \"What was the last conversation I had with my Mother?\" Those other two things easily could have been discovered by Henry, but not this. Mark knew it would be impossible. He was all alone in that hospital room with her. \"If that's what you want, alright Mark.\" Richard sighed and took a moment to reflect on it. \"She was asleep when you went into her hospital room and you looked over a family picture. When she woke up, she asked why you didn't wake her. You thought she needed sleep and she told you she would rather see you. She then asked if your Dad had told you everything and said she knew you'd be okay. She'll always be with you, Mark. You both said 'I love you' and...\" Richard paused, feeling a bit emotional. His eyes were sparkling. Tears? Mark was shocked. Sure, Henry had fake cried before, but this was different. This seemed so genuine. \"Well, Mark, you told her she wasn't going to die... because you wouldn't let her.\" Richard continued, and paused once more, waiting to see if it had been enough to convince him. Mark stared at him, speechless. It was all true, and something Henry could not have known. Connie, who had calmed down and was now wiping her tears away, looked to Mark, \" Mark? I trust him. I believe it's really Richard.\" Jen and Richard both smiled. \"So... can you trust me, Mark?\" AUTHOR'S NOTE: Sorry for another short chapter. I wanted to get something published since it had been over 3 months again. I'm doing my best to keep working on this, but my brain is starting to feel dead lately. I won't give up though. Also, I'm about to begin a new job - which is working overnights. I will do my best to still find time to write. Thank for sticking with me this long. As always, please send ANY ideas/suggestions to me in PM. They're very appreciated! I'm trying to figure out what to do about Jack. Also, the ending of this fic is written and ready. I'm looking forward to sharing it...I just have to get the story to that point.[Chapter 30] October 17th. 2:27 am. Hello, journal. It's good to have you. Mark gave you to me earlier tonight and said you'd be beneficial. Well, I guess I'll start off by saying that I can't sleep. Today was quite eventful. Richard is here with us- possessing Henry. But for how long? Hopefully he can hold on long enough to figure out how to save Castiel. If it isn't already too late. I'm worried. Connie is asleep on an air mattress on the other side of this room. Mark insisted, and told us to keep the door locked. Understandable, since we never know when Henry will \"wake up\". Richard is sleeping out on the couch and Mark is keeping an eye on him in a nearby chair, just in case. I'm just glad he believes it's Richard now. That was a mess earlier. I wish I could get to sleep. There's too much on my mind. And... I'm still having flashbacks, but haven't told anyone this. I'm trying to be strong and keep a positive mind set. I don't want to be weak anymore. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to crumble, but I'm fighting. I'll never stop fighting. I'm thankful for Mark, but sometimes *BAM*! Something struck the front door with such force, it was a miracle it didn't break it down. Connie was jolted out of her sleep and sat upright, \"What was that?!\" \"Mark?!\" Jen screamed, dropped her journal, and rushed out into the living room. Mark had jumped up from his chair and ran to the front door, \"Stay in here! I'll go check it out.\" Connie joined them a moment later and went over to Richard, who was now holding his head and groaning in pain. \"Hey, are you ok?\" Jen reached out and grabbed onto Connie's arm, which had started to extend out to her brother, \" Not a good idea, Connie. Remember, we need to be careful.\" As Richard groaned again, Jen pulled Connie back a few steps. Suddenly, Mark was dragging the body of a bruised and bloodied man inside, \"I need a hand over here! Help me get him on the chair!\" Jen ran over and helped lift the man, \"Who is this?\" Mark shook his head, \" I don't know. He was just laying out there. I didn't see anyone else around, but lock the door just in case.\" As they sat the man in the chair where Mark had been sleeping, Connie secured the front door and rejoined them. Mark turned his attention to Richard, who was still holding his head in pain and now breathing heavily. \"Rich? Is it Henry?\" No answer. \"Oh my god! \" Jen screamed, after getting a closer look at the man, \"It's- It's Officer Pete Gimel. He was on the scene of my parents' accident.\" Before anyone could respond, the house began to shake, as if an earthquake was occurring. Everyone was knocked off of their feet and items that had been hanging on the walls crashed all around them. ","Summary":" Author's Note: Let's say Henry never died after that fall.
