You will have to make do with my handwritten note of love and care, and potted Rosemary plant, a starter for the kitchen garden you often mention. I refuse the normal sacraments of the day because I rebel against the taxpayer subsidized corporations who profit from $4.50 cards. Perhaps I want to \"Save the Earth\" by not subsidizing flowers grown by slaves overseas, and transported here by environment-killing turbojet engines through the stratosphere. I die a little inside each time I view the tortured roses propped in chemical-laced stagnant water, striving to live through their medicated death throws, until I am required to dispose of them. I show my love to you when I bank my entire paycheck and every bonus into our joint credit union account. I show forbearance when your bonus goes to a decorative \"special item\" that must be purchased. Earlier in your life, you learned that the correct authority figures exist everywhere in society as government officials, police, teachers, doctors, news anchors, celebrities. You follow them blindly regardless of logic or results of their policies or information. You refuse to research any topic, to gauge what you witness with your own eyes against what you see on TV. You also are conditioned to ignore your husband's opinions and policies, because they are not 100% based on the quickest short term solution. You are smart, magna-cum laude in your University Master's program, and it is a burden to carry this conflict inside, so you periodically break down into fits of tears. After the purging you are fine and great. The worries have been shed, handed to the husband witness. Never do the tears bring about change in behavior. I'll continue to show my love to you. I show my love when I work all weekend to save $600 on a car repair. When I wearily strip from my filthy clothes and enter the house bleeding from a busted knuckle, you really don't need to warn me about the carpet, that is why I'm holding it in a paper towel. When you have uncontrollable nausea and diarrhea, and nearly faint from exhaustion I'm there for you, cleaning both ends. When I fold your laundry, consisting entirely of heavy flannel pajamas, I remember how the last sexy lingerie I gave you, years ago, is hidden unworn in the lower back drawer of your dresser, how you dismiss any compliment of your appearance or attractiveness. Putting these words down has been cathartic. Perhaps this is my equivalent of a good cry. However, being who I am, I wonder, even at my advanced age of 55 years, if something should be done.

From my warm, green grass, all ways sunny home. I'm riding a plane from Italy to Alaska. But still begging my black short haired dad to not take the job. But my blonde haired mom tells me that it is a great idea so I can make new friends. But my sister dose not really care as long as I stay out of her lushly brown short hair. Wait she is the only one who thinks her hair is lushly. Flying on that plane I seemed to have fallen asleep and in my dream if it was a dream. I saw very pale boy about my age that seemed to be just standing there I asked what his name was but he did not answer. Then I heard what sounded like my mom saying \"Alex Alex wake up were here.\" My dream started to fade as I awoke. Not sure what I had just saw but it didn't matter I could think about it in the car with three hour drive I still had. While in the car I seemed to have fallen to sleep once again. Where I had almost the same dream but this time I caught his name. His name was Daniel he had short blonde hair and was a little taller than me but I'm about 4 feet 7 inches. So that's not much to be proud of. I was awoken by the sound of dog's feet pounding on the icy ground. When I was fully up try understand what it all meant. Was this boy just someone I had dreamed and I should ignore it. Maybe I will soon meet him but how would I have dreamed about him if I have never meet him. I decide to talk to my sister Ashley when I told her all I had dreamed. She said to me \"You're a dork leave it to you to think of the impossible ideas.\" Well maybe a good night's sleep will sever me good. When I walked into my new house I think I about passed out. It was so cold I could not believe it. How could one place be so cold? Tomorrow me and my sister start school we are both are at the middle school. We now live in the city of Nome. \"Alex time for dinner.\" Called my mother with cheer in her voice. After dinner I decide to explore to find my room. When I discovered that I got the biggest room. That room would be the attic. My mom said that I could paint it any color I'd like and I did. I painted that room bright pink that was one thing I liked about this place. I had my queen sized loft bed with pink sheets of course. A night side table with a lamp.[Chapter 2] Going to bed was one of the hardest things I think I have ever done. I had ten blankets on me it was so cold. But yet I was still cold. I fell asleep and saw Daniel again this time he told me that I should be scared. But then said I can't stay away. Then heard my mom yell \"Alex wake up for school you don't want to be late on your first day.\" I got up and put on long white leggings my favorite jean skirt and my pink fuzzy vest and a brown long sleeved shirt.

Chapter 1 Nothing to Live For When you don't have a memory of what you've already lived through, what's the point in living the rest? You walk around in a total daze. Luckily, I did have family and friends to help me regain my past. To help me fill the black void that was my memory and - at that time - my heart. I now lived the life of a normal seventeen year-old. I wake up, wash up, get dressed, have breakfast, go to school, classes, lunch, more classes, dismissal, and I drive home. I made new friends in high school, but only two of them were rather talkative. Their names are Ellie and Janie. It seemed as if they would never shut up!!! It got really annoying, but if you were sad and needed to be cheered up, you know who to go to. 舻 \"Ashley,\" Janie called from across the court, \"are you okay?!\" She said after I stood up from getting hit in the face with a volleyball. I was never that good at sports. Maybe that was due to the fact that I was uncoordinated, or had two left feet. Either way, I was bad. \"Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks, that was just what I needed to wake me up!\" I said in a sarcastically perky and bitter tone. \"Sorry!\" Then the pain came. Not from the ball, in fact I don't know why I felt it. And then it hit me. How could I forget?! The pain of a memory trying unsuccessfully to come to mind about my past. This had been happening a lot lately. Weird, right? Now, after the pain of the memory, came the physical pain. My nose felt like it was bleeding, my lips were numb, and I had a bit of a black eye. Not bad though, a little makeup should do the trick. \"Oh boy,\" I muttered. I did this kind of walking limp to the bathroom. Well my nose isn't bleeding, but I think my top lip is numb. Well crap! I thought. 舻 A week later during our social studies class, our physical education/social science teacher Mr. Kemnitz, gave us new seat arrangements. 'Oh my gosh!!! It's Robert Paliano!! One of the cutest Italian transfers. Not only is he one of the cutest boys in the junior class, but he is one of the nicest too! I would be sooo lucky if he just noticed me once in my lifetime!' Sadly, he had a girlfriend. She was super perky and pretty, but not very bright. She is varsity cheerleader, master debater, and she speaks fluent French. Lucky for me though, Robert and I both speak fluent Italian. I also know bits and pieces from other languages. Mostly yes, no, and devil. I know them in Russian, German, Spanish, English, and I know peace in Hebrew. I can also write in Chinese 1-10, 100, and 10,000. During our social studies class Mr. Kemnitz opens a debate on why we made the constitution. This discussion was to be on an amendment we think should be added and why. The debate part was on what we think about the amendment being added to the constitution and how it would affect us. This class time went downhill fast. Robert actually noticed me! Well, sort of. He said me in Italian 'Hello my dear'. Then in English he asked me what would happen if we refused to participate in the debate. I replied in Italian something I didn't mean to say. I had still been in shock so I wasn't paying much attention to what I said. I had said \"For a kiss I'll tell you.\" 舻 For about a week after that, it seemed as if I were some kind of unknown harmful species that if you talked to, you suffered some kind of disease that was incurable. He had treated me as if I was a bug and he was an anthropologist looking at an undiscovered species of arthropods. I felt so uncomfortable. His girlfriend made me even more uncomfortable. Her name is Hailey Teter. Her favorite on the squad, besides herself of course, was a girl named Molly Larson who was dating the captain of the football team. I don't why but if the varsity cheerleader doesn't date the football captain, her favorite does. It's kind of like some unspoken cheer code. It's weird right? Or is it just weird to me? Or am I just crazy? This is how the whole 'For a kiss I'll tell you' thing happened...[Chapter 2] Robert's eyes. Chapter 1 New Classes I had only been in school for one week when Hailey Teter asked if I wanted to hang out after school. \"Sure,\" I replied even though I had seen a girl minutes before whom I thought to be much more attractive and loveable. I would rather hang out with her. So Hailey and I ended up going to the Drive In on Friday night. It was us and Molly Larson and the captain of the football team. Hank Ryans was the most repulsive man I've ever seen. He dressed with his boxers hanging out of his pants, a loose shirt that if the wind blew in a certain way, you could see them and he had shoes that didn't fit his feet. He wore a size 10. He was wearing a pair of size 12 shoes that he didn't even tie. What a strange culture these Americans have. Back home in Italy, we would never dress so vulgar. It should be against the law. 舻 After the movie, I asked Hailey about Ashley. She had stated and I quote, \" Her?! She's a dorky nerd who needs not only to get a face transplant from someone prettier but also needs to get a new wardrobe! I mean come on, look at her! What is this? The fourth grade?!\" At that moment I knew I could never love this savage beast excuse for a lady in my entire life. But at the same time, I also knew that if in my new school, I didn't want to become target number one on the school enemy list, I better stick with her. 舻 One day during social studies after we had gotten new seats, a debate was opened. It was really boring from the start so I didn't get to hear all of what Mr. Kemnitz had said we were to do. Oh well, at least I can sit here and stare at her. I had gotten placed in the best spot in the world! I got to sit next to Ashley Douglas. She even knew how to speak Italian! So I could talk to her in front of Hailey and she wouldn't even know! Lucky for me, Hailey spoke French, not Italian. At first she thought I was French so she took that class. \"Buongiorno, il mio caro,\" I said as seductively as I could. \"Ciao.\" Am I dreaming?!?! She actually talked to me! Thank you divine being that is favoring me today! \"So what happens if we refuse to answer or take part in the debate?\" \"For a kiss, I'll tell you.\" I don't know what to think. I don't know what to say. What I did know is that I desperately wanted to take her up on her offer and kiss her then and there. 舻 It was a week later when I finally got the nerve to talk to her. She was standing by her locker. Perfect! I can talk to her alone there. I thought. I was just about to talk to her when some guy with huge muscles stepped out of the crowd of people walking by and started talking to her. So instead of talking to her, I hid where she couldn't see me and listened to their \"little chat.\" \"So do you want to go? You know, with me?\" Had he just asked her out?! Did I already miss my chance?! \"Erik, I'd love to-\" \"Ashley!\" I interrupted their conversation, I know that's stupid. I just couldn't bear to see her happy with another guy. Especially one who wouldn't think twice about hurting her if she messed something up for him. \"but I can't. I'm really sorry. Maybe some other time.\" She turned to look at me. I was such an idiot! The next thing I know is I say \"I've decided to take you up on your offer.\" And then I kissed her. I made sure to do this before she had a chance to object. Her lips tasted like cherries. She must have recently put on lip gloss. ","Summary":" Ashley's eyes.

At least I tried right?) \"Wait, Jenny?\" \"Yes Lola?\" \"What is this?\" She asked, as she pulled out and showed me what she was looking at with a concerned look on her face. I look at what she was showing me, and I realized why she was so concerned. \"Oh that.\" I replied \"That's um... that's, well, they needed something to confirm my age so what you're holding is, my.. certificate of adoption.\" \"And why do you have a certificate of adoption?\" She asked with this worried look on her face. \"Well, I don't think I've ever told you this so it makes sense why you're so confused, but I'm, Actually adopted.\" I answered, knowing that this next conversation will be interesting. \"Oh\" she said, with a puzzled look on her face \"How come you never told me that before?\" \"Well this, may sound like something that you would say but mostly because you never asked. Besides it's no big deal.\" I said as I looked away to get back to the other paperwork I was working on. \"No big deal? Jenny I know you're modest but this is kinda something I should've known.\" Said Lola trying to get my attention \"Could you at least explain to me how?\" I looked over to her puzzled. \"What do you mean how?\" \"Well... you know.\" She was trying to get the right words out \"How you... got adopted.\" \"OK, when I was a baby, I was found on the doorstep of an orphanage in New Jersey. I stayed there until I was three years old. Then one day I was playing with another girl when my parents first met me. They were originally looking to adopt a baby but when they saw me... it was like they took pity on me since acording to the care taker, I was passed by about six different couples before my parents came. So after a few weeks and several visits from them, they came to see me and asked if I wanted to come home with them. I said yes and now years later here we are.\" \"Huh.\" She said with another odd look on her face. \"And you're so chill with this because?\" \"Because I know their not my real parents yet I'll gladly say they are.\" I quickly replied. Although I may have sounded like I was a little annoyed \"Okay\" she said raising her hands up like she was in trouble \"If you're so okay with it, why not just tell me that you were adopted in the first place?\" I guess I do owe her that much \"Do you know why people decide to adopt?\" \"Because they like kids?\" \"Everyone has their reasons why. Some people adopt because their ready to have a child. Some because they don't want the kid they already have to be lonely. For my parents, it was because they had been talking about having kids for awhile and unfortunately, they couldn't.\" \"What do you mean they couldn't?\" \"I mean my mom can't physically have kids. She can't get pregnant so, they decided to adopt. And they choose me.\" \"Oh.\" \"Yeah, but although I'm grateful for them taking me in. I don't really see them as my adoptive parents. I see them, as my real parents.\" \"And you're okay with it?\" \"Why wouldn't I? Their two amazing people that love me and care for me. I'm not there biological child yes, but in a way... I'm that child they couldn't have. And this may sound a little childish, but I'm grateful that I have them.\" \"So their your... real parents?\" \"That's how I see it. And I'm proud of it.\" I said with a smile. \"Okay, could I just ask one question?\" Asked Lola \"I don't see why not.\" \"Well... forgive me if I come off offensively, but have you ever... I'm pretty sure I'm gonna regret this... have you ever thought of finding your... actual, bio whatnot parents? \"Biological, and... you know, I've never really put that much thought into it.\" \"Wait really?\" \"Well I mean I've thought about what they might have been like from time to time but other than that, I've never actually thought I should go and find them.\" \"Just, out of curiosity but why not?\" \"Well like I said, I think of my adoptive parents as my real parents. So why look for your real parents when their right in front of you?\" \"I guess that makes sense, but what if one day you meet your actual parents? What would you say?\" \"Never thought about that before. But whatever happens, I'll cross that path when I reach it.\" \"Well if that's what you want to do, fine by me.\" \"Oh well thank you for your blessing.\" I said sarcastically \"You're welcome\" she replied acknowledging the sarcasm \"So, any other questions on the application?\" I asked changing the subject \"Just a few more.\" \"Well then let's get started then.\" It was about another twenty minutes later when Lola had to leave but we were able to get my application all ready. All I needed left was a picture of me to go with it. As the photo printer finished up printing my picture, I couldn't help but recall my earlier conversation with Lola. She did have a point, what if one day I did meet my biological parents? I've never really thought about it before but now that I have... like I said earlier, I'll cross that path when I reach it I guess. I was about to put my photo of me next to my adoption papers an odd thought. What if I have other siblings? What if I have like a brother or a sister that I never knew about? You know what, if I do have a sibling I've never met, I'm sure I'll met them one day. Until then, I guess I'll just have to wonder. I place my application into the envelope and put it in the mail going out pile for dad to put in the mail box in the morning. Then I head upstairs to go get ready for bed.

This is a problem.\" The green-eyed blonde crinkled her forehead in confusion. \"How so?\" \"We can't get married if he's passed out!\" Lola answered, causing the two girls to burst into laughter. Meanwhile, in the room across the hall, the groom-to-be was apprehensively pacing back and forth. \"Dude, you're going to burn a hole in the carpet,\" Zac warned his friend, officer Maxwell James. Handing him a bottle of water, he jumped back in slight alarm as Max snatched it out of his hands and took a long swig. \"You sure you're okay?\" \"Who, me? Oh, I'm fine. Couldn't be better.\" Zac shot him a knowing smirk. \"It's going to be fine. When you see Lola walking down that aisle, you won't even remember being nervous.\" \"Yeah, sure. Whatever you say. What time is it?\" \"A quarter to three.\" Max started pacing again. \"Oh no. No, no, no. Fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes until she becomes Mrs. Lola James. This will never work. I know it. She's going to leave me. She's regretting saying yes as we speak. I can feel it.\" Zac let out a hearty laugh. \"She's put up with you for this long,\" he teased. \"I highly doubt now would be the time she would choose to back out.\" The officer shot him a glare and tossed the empty water bottle into the trash can. He smoothed out his tux and took a deep, cleansing breath. \"You're right. It's fine. Everything is going to be fine.\" As he began to imagine what Lola might look like, a wistful expression danced across the features of his face. \"As a matter of fact, I can't wait.\" The quarter of the hour passed quickly. Zac and Max walked to the front of the church where the pastor was standing and took their places. The church echoed with the swells of the first few notes of the wedding march as Max turned to face the front of the chapel. Suddenly, Lola appeared in the doorway with her father by her side; the groom's heart stopped upon the appearance of his bride. Of course he had always thought Lola was beautiful. There were no ifs, ands, or buts about that. At this particular moment, however, words were a complete loss for him. This went beyond beauty. She was... mesmerizing. Zac had been right; the bundle of nerves that had seemed so overwhelming before were now non-existent. The organ music came to a slow, steady stop as Lola reached the front of the chapel. Flashing a bright smile to her future husband, she delicately handed Jenny her bouquet. \"Dearly beloved,\" the pastor boasted, \"we are gathered here today to witness the joining of this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Should anyone have any objection to this union, please, speak now or forever hold your peace.\" The congregation remained silent. He smiled. \"Very well. Now, who gives away this woman to this man?\" Lola's father stood up from where he had just taken a seat in the front row, giving a polite nod. \"Her mother and I do.\" The pastor nodded back. \"Then we will begin by having these two exchange their vows.\" Max took her by the hands, gazing into her deep brown eyes. \"Lola Perez, from the moment I met you I knew you were trouble. Quite frankly you are stubborn, don't think before you act, and have a high disregard for rules most of the time.\" An uncomfortable expression crossed Lola's face. He had anticipated this and ignored it, his smile growing even wider as he continued to speak. \"In spite of that, you are also one of the most courageous, free-spirited, and kind-hearted people I know. There was something about you that instantly attracted me, and to this day I still can't quite put my finger on it. All I remember is that the day I gave you that parking ticket, I said to myself, 'I've got to get to know this girl.' Ever since, I've managed to fall more in love with you, and I cannot wait to start the next chapter in my life with you as part of it. I promise to love you unconditionally and remain by your side through whatever life throws our way.\" Lola smiled gave a slight sniff as her eyes welled with tears. She squeezed his hands tightly, trying to gather her thoughts. \"Maxwell James,\" she began, clearing her throat, \"life with you so far has been nothing short of an adventure, and there is no doubt in my mind that as we start this journey together, there will be more adventures to come. You are the most compassionate, caring, and selfless man I have ever met. I see this every day, not only in how you treat me, but how you treat others by serving our community. I love you more than you will ever know, and I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\" The pastor smiled once he realized Lola was finished speaking and gave a gentle nod. \"Now for the rings.\" Emily walked up behind Lola, who was carrying Max's ring on a pillow as Trey walked up behind Max with Lola's. Max took the ring off of the pillow delicately. \"Now, Max, if you would, please repeat after me,\" the pastor stated. \"With this ring I thee wed.\" \"With this ring I thee wed.\" \"I promise to love, honor, and cherish you all the days of my life.\" \"I promise to love, honor, and cherish you all the days of my life,\" he repeated, carefully slipping the ring onto Lola's left finger. The pastor turned to Lola with a smile. \"Lola, please repeat after me. With this ring I thee wed.\" She peered up at the handsome blonde man before her with a broad smile. \"With this ring I thee wed.\" \"I promise to love, honor, and cherish you for all the days of my life.\" \"I promise to love, honor, and cherish you for all the days of my life,\" she whispered. With a slightly shaky hand, she slipped the ring onto his finger as the pastor closed the Bible that was in his hands with a gentle thud. \"By the power vested in me in the state of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Mr. James, you may kiss your bride.\" The congregation erupted into gentle applause as Max pulled Lola in. His lips delicately crashed into her own, and he instantly felt her smile against them. \"I can't... believe it,\" she murmured through kisses with a giggle. \"I'm officially Mrs. Maxwell James.\" The couple hesitantly broke apart as Lola's parents approached them. Her mother's eyes were bloodshot from tears. \"Oh, honey, you look so beautiful!\" Lola wrapped her into a warm hug, her voice breaking. \"Thanks, mom.\" Mr. Perez turned toward Max. \"So help me, if I find out that you aren't taking care of her...\" The officer gave a gentle roll of his eyes. \"I know, I know. I have to answer to you. Don't worry, sir. You have my word.\" The elder man reciprocated with a sincere smile. Katy and Emily, who had been chattering away contentedly, let out sudden shrill squeals that caused Lola and the others to turn their heads. The girls broke apart as AJ Anderson came speeding down the aisle on her rollerblades, placing a sharp stop on the brake right before she reached the adults. \"Is it time for cake yet?\" Katy let out an excited gasp. \"Oh, I hope so! Please! Is it, Lola? Is it? Is it?\" Lola laughed. \"Almost.\" She nodded toward the direction of the dining hall. \"We'd better head to the reception before these girls die from lack of cake.\" Max's eyes widened as he feigned a horrified gasp. \"No! Not lack of cake. Anything but lack of cake!\" \"You know, I've heard of that.\" Jenny interjected as she approached them. \"Nothing to joke about. It's a horrible disease.\" AJ shot her a skeptical look. \"It is?\" Jenny nodded, attempting to remain as serious as possible. \"The desire for cake becomes so strong that you walk around like a bug-eyed robot.\" She wiggled her fingers and began to furiously tickle Katy, causing the church to echo with continuous giggles. Once the curly-headed child's laughter died down, she stood upright, widening her eyes with outstretched arms. \"MUST. HAVE. CAKE.\" \"Oh, no!\" Lola cried, placing her hand over her mouth in mock horror. \"Lack of cake is kicking in. Quick! To the dining hall!\" The group followed the small crowd that was gradually gathering into the dining hall for the reception. Max and Lola took their places in front of the cake. They cut the first slice, delicately placing the first bite into each others mouths. The next thing Lola knew, Max shoved his entire plate of cake into her face. \"Honey,\" she began, her tone evident that it was taking a bit of effort to keep her temper, \"I thought we agreed that we weren't going to do that.\" \"You only get married once.\" Lola's eyes formed slits. \"That's where you're wrong. Marry this!\" Shoving her plate into his face, she wiggled it around forcefully, covering his face in white frosting. Delicately picking crumbs off of his face, she sprinkled them into his hair, smiling in satisfaction. \"NO!\" Katy screeched, racing toward them. \"THEY'RE WASTING CAKE!\" Lola couldn't help but laugh at the tiny girl's dismay. \"No worries,\" she promised as she grabbed a napkin and began to wipe the icing off of her face. \"There's plenty for everyone.\" As Max and Lola went to wash their faces, Jenny and Zac helped serve the cake. Once the girls had been saved from lack of cake, Lola clanged her fork against the side of her champagne glass to get everyone's attention. \"Time to toss the bouquet!\" Every lady in attendance proceeded to make a small mosh pit behind Lola as she turned away from the group and tossed the arrangement of flowers behind her with great force; Jenny reached out her arms as high as they would go and caught the flowers with equal precision. Lola turned around just in time to see, her eyes glittering with excitement. \"Good going, bridesmaid!\" Jenny took an extravagant bow. \"Thank you, thank you.\" The room swelled with the notes of a gentle slow song that began streaming from the speakers. Max took Lola's hand and led her to the dance floor with Zac and Jenny right behind them. \"Have I told you how stunning you look this afternoon?\" Zac questioned, wrapping his arms around her waist and pulling her closer. Jenny pretended to ponder his question for a moment. \"Mmm, only around ten times.\" She bit her bottom lip timidly and forced herself to meet his gaze. \"I won't object to being reminded, though.\" As they swayed to the music, Jenny casually rested her head on his shoulder. Watching her best friend swaying to the music with her husband from a distance, she couldn't help but think about how happy she was for them. There had been quite a few objections from the parents at first on the nuptials of the two; Lola's parents insisted that even though she were twenty-one she was still far too young to be getting married and that she should finish college before making such a rash decision. Max's parents, on the other hand, were concerned that the commitment might affect his career. After much logical persuasion, the families had finally, yet hesitantly, given their blessing. Jenny was a different story. She had seen firsthand how deeply Lola loved Max and had no doubt that they would make it. There was no question that there would be disagreements down the road. Jenny was a very intelligent person and knew that things would not always be perfect between them, but she was also smart enough to know that they were committed individuals who would not give up on each other. \"Do you think that will be us someday?\" she murmured yearningly in Zac's ear. He smiled and began rubbing her back tenderly. His tone was playful when he spoke. \"You caught the bouquet, didn't you?\" She pulled away. \"Oh, please. That's petty superstition.\" He laughed. \"How did I know you were going to say that?\" Staring at him with affection, she reached up her arm, brushing a stray strand of his soft, brown hair away from his face. \"Because you know everything about me,\" she whispered. \"I feel like you know me more than I know myself sometimes.\" Her expression hardened slightly. \"But I also know you. Now quit trying to change the subject. Do you think we'll get married someday or not?\" \"Will there be cake?\" Jenny rolled her eyes. \"Not you, too.\" As the two of them continued to dance, Zac placed a delicate kiss on her lips. It was then she decided not to push the question further. She had been asking out of curiosity. If she were being honest with herself, marriage was the furthest thing from her mind. She knew how Zac felt about her and that was the most important thing. Worrying about the future won't change anything, she thought, smiling against his lips. And we all know that worrying is so not my style. THE END.

She was wearing a shirt that was Zac's and was way too big for her, but she loved stealing clothes from Zac. And Zac didn't mind; he thought she looked sexy in them. Zac stared at her while she was sleeping, the engagement ring he was giving her in his hands. It was a simple engagement ring, it had a diamond on it and it was twenty four karat gold. He was planning to put it on Jenny while she's sleeping, and then surprise her with strawberries in bed in the morning. No one knew about the engagement, only Zac's parents and Jenny's parents. Come on Zac, you can do this! Just slip the ring onto her finger quietly. Breathing in, Zac crawled over to Jenny, and very carefully, he took her hand and slid the engagement ring onto her ringer. He put it down and watched as she moved positions, moving from her stomach to her back and wrapping the blankets up to her chin...and not waking up! Yes! Cheering in his head, Zac pecked Jenny on the cheek and then went to sleep, hoping tomorrow will go smoothly. Jenny's POV When I woke up the next morning, I saw strawberries in bed, and Zac was lying shirtless in bed next to me, wearing a big smile on his face. When Zac saw me awake, he captured my lips in a kiss, making it sweet and passionate. \"What's with you shirtless and strawberries in bed?\" I wanted to know, taking a strawberry and putting it into my mouth, closing my eyes and enjoying the sweetness of it. When I opened my eyes, Zac was lying back down in bed, staring at something on my finger. What is he staring at? I wanted to know. I stared down at my finger, and I froze seeing an engagement ring on my finger...how'd that get on there? I looked back at Zac and I saw that he was staring at me. He took my hand and led me to the end of the bed, where he sat on the floor, kneeling down on one knee and taking my hands in the other. \"Jenny Parker\" he started to say, staring at me with his beautiful blue eyes. \"I want to be with you forever and ever. When I first met you, I thought you were the prettiest girl I've ever laid eyes on. When you turned me down when I asked you to the concert with me, I was crushed, but when you explained everything at the concert that night, I wanted to kiss you...luckily I got to do that on the night I asked you out. I promise to love you every second of every day, and I promise to calm you down when you get nervous or stressed. So will you Jenny Parker marry me?\" I was bawling my eyes out. I nodded and Zac started smiling that beautiful smile I love, standing up and standing me up, me crashing my lips to his before he had the chance. He picked me up by the waist, and carried me to the bed. We got onto each other, making out for awhile, and then finally stopping and putting our foreheads together and smiling like idiots. \"How'd you get this ring on me?\" I wanted to know. Zac pecked my lips and he placed his hands on both sides of me. \"Last night while you were sleeping, I put the ring on you. You're a heavy sleeper by the way.\" I giggled and I picked up a strawberry, feeding it to Zac, and then eating the rest. After that, I crashed my lips to Zac, excited that I get to spend the rest of my life with him.

Lola was shocked, did she just hear right did she just hear Jenny telling her she pulled out of something so great. \"I'm taking the summer off,\" Jenny said as she saw Lolas shocked expression. \"But what about college, early admission, transcripts,\" Lola said, as she listed the things Jenny told her she was aiming for when they first met. \"What about fun and free time and living outside of the box,\" Jenny said, smiling. \"Well since you're such an expert on this college stuff maybe you could help me with my art school applications?\" Lola asked, smiling. \"Sure. friends help friends right,\" Jenny said. \"Yeah,\" Lola said, as they began walking. \"And if you ever need a reccomondation as a babysitter, feel free to use my name,\" Jenny said, memories of the adventure they had of babysitting. \"I think I should probably retire,\" Lola said, with a smile earning a laugh from Jenny. \"Gotcha,\" Jenny said, she wouldn't blame Lola even though some parts were fun that being the first time babysitting would make her not want to do it again. They laughed as they came to a stop by the stairs. \"Um hey , could you send me the pictures from the other night?\" Jenny asked, she would like to have something to remind her of that hetic night. \"Yeah, of course, i'll send them over to everyone,\" Lola said, smiling warmily at Jenny. \"Come here\" Lola beckond as she gave Jenny a hug who hugged her back.

Lola couldn't believe that Jenny had done this, she had got her a new camera and a good modle at that a Sony HX400. \"You're welcome,\" Jenny said as she continued to hold Lola. \"I felt bad that you gave up your camera, something that meant a lot to you so would be allowed in to go catch Zac, I'm grateful for it, and you deserve it you are so talented,\" Jenny said as she pulled away from Lola who had now calmed down. \"Thank you,\" Lola said again.

I've had an absolutely terrible day so far. I had completely forgotten that I had papers due in both of the classes I had today, which meant I didn't have either one written. I ended up getting an incomplete on one, and a fail on the other, which I now had twenty-four hours to turn in. On top of all that, I skipped breakfast, so I was starving. At this point I'm not sure it could get much worse. I was on my way to the cafeteria to get lunch when I was stopped by a guy in the middle of the quad. \"Excuse me,\" I heard the Bible Guy yelling at me. I thought about stopping and actually listening to him, but I was already tired and frankly, I didn't want to. I just wasn't in the mood. But the faster I walked, the louder he yelled. \"Excuse me!,\" he hollered again and I walked even quicker. \"Wow, you're really rude, aren't you?\" I wanted to scream, I was so tired of this guy surrounding the quad, harassing me. Who does that? I don't want to deal with him. That wasn't me being rude, it was just me being honest. \"Excuse me?\" I said, as I stopped in my tracks and turned around to look at him. \"I just wanted to ask you if you'd taken our Lord and Savior into your heart,\" he said, clearly having no intentions of letting me go. I am absolutely fed up. \"Really? Then why are you being so rude to me? That doesn't seem very Christ-like to me. Besides, is it any of your business what religion I am?\" I snapped at him. \"It's a simple question, are you going to answer it or not?\" he shot back and I rolled my eyes. I just want to get away from him, but I couldn't find a good way to escape. Suddenly, I felt someone wrap their arms around my waist. I looked up to see some strange girl that I don't know. \"Hey, babe. Is he bothering you?\" she asked as she glanced down at her watch. \"You're going to be late to bible study, aren't you?\" She smiled at me and I smiled back involuntarily. It was like my face had a mind of its own and even though normally this would have weirded me out, there was something about her that made me feel comfortable. \"Um,\" I said, leaving the question open ended on purpose. I didn't want to lie about going to a bible study but, I also wanted to get away from this guy as soon as possible. \"Oh, then I guess I should let you go,\" the guy said awkwardly. As I walked away from him the mystery girl walked with me. \"So, who are you?\" I asked, intrigued by this mysterious stranger. \"Lola, you?\" \"I'm Jenny, Jenny Parker,\" I said in an overly perky tone and I immediately felt ridiculously proper. This wasn't new though, I had a way of embarrassing myself in front of anyone that was even remotely cool. That's why I always had a hard time making friends. \"Well it's nice to meet you, Jenny Parker,\" she said with a sly smile that made my heart skip a beat. \"It's nice to meet you, too. Oh! Um, thank you for saving me back there.\" \"No problem, I know how he gets. He's in my Christian Scriptures class and he drives me crazy,\" she said with a little laugh. \"You're in a Christian Scriptures class?\" I asked, surprised . Looking at her, in her leather jacket, ripped jeans, and combat boots I never would have pictured her as someone that was into religion. \"Yeah, it's pretty cool too. You shouldn't judge a book by its cover, Jenny Parker,\" she smirked. There was something about her that was so full of magic and that I couldn't help but want to hold onto her for as long as I could. \"Sorry,\" I mumbled, feeling bad that I'd judged her. \"It's cool. You know what? I've gotta go, I have this class I need to get to, but, call me later, yeah?\" she asked as she pulled out a pen, grabbed my arm and scribbled her number down. After she ran off I smiled. I couldn't stop smiling for the rest of the day. A/N: I hope that you enjoyed reading this story! Please check out my tumblr katyhunter and review if you liked it!

Hers is let loose, cascading down her back and you admire it for a second before opening your locker. Three lockers sit between the two of you but Lola doesn't even blink an eye at you. That's okay though, you didn't expect her to (she looks older; she's at least five inches taller and has no baby fat left in her cheeks) and you don't feel like you've particularly lost out on anything with her not even saying hi. Even then, before you know her name or her reputation, you know Lola Perez with her leather jacket and Doc Martens is the kind of girl who is way too cool for you. Besides, you have to get straight A's and friends - as you'll later learn, especially friends like Lola - are a distraction. You've never gotten on too well with other kids, anyways. Not because you're rude or anything. It's more that you don't get them and they don't get you so the kids in your grade, while friendly if they see you outside of school or if you have to partner up in class, don't bother you and you don't bother them. It's a little lonely sometimes but you've always been the type to prefer curling up with a good book and some hot chocolate to going to the movies or the city. Once you're in your first period (Honors English, no assigned seating so you grab a seat front and center), listening to your teacher go over the course outline, you let your mind drift back to Lola. You still don't know her name yet so you decide she looks like a Carmen. Decide she's all boldness and toothy grins that make people's knees weak. Let yourself think how nice her mouth is because you wish your lips were that full. Your thoughts dance close to her looking down at you and raising an eyebrow, asking something - you can't decide what but she calls you babe and you like it - and with her hands on yours. Then you shake your head clear, remind yourself boldness and toothy grins come with trouble and irresponsibility, and reprimand yourself for not paying attention to your teacher. The smallest part of your mind wonders out loud if that's kind of gay, but you think Miles Daniels is really cute and have been harboring a crush on him since the seventh grade so it can't be. All you were doing was wondering what it would b e like to be friends with her, anyway. That's perfectly normal - you've done it tons of times before. Nothing eventful happens after that but you do run into Miles and he does smile at you which makes your stomach flip uncomfortably. You lie and tell your parents you made friends when they ask. Before you know it, it's Halloween. For you, Halloween means staying in and handing out candy with your mom with a witch hat on, so you don't dress up at all, outside of a shirt that reads \"BOO\" with a ghost beneath it. You figure that it won't even matter because this is high school and you're sure most high schoolers don't have Halloween costumes appropriate for school or that they would even want to wear Halloween costumes to school anyway. You don't find out how right you were about inappropriate Halloween costumes until lunch. Lola, whose name you have now learned thanks to the amount of people who say hi to her in the halls, was late to school (again, she's late at least twice a week, you've noticed) so you hadn't seen her while at your locker that morning. And then she's right there at her locker in a scandalously tight bodysuit with a pair of sheer leggings - you're sure she's violating dress code because that should not be legal - and with her hair tied up tight and sleek and devil horns on her head and - oh. Oh. Okay then. She's turned around, talking to some dumb senior boy, so you don't catch a glimpse of her face and you're really, really glad about that because you kind of can't feel your legs right now and you're sure you'd pass out if you saw just how tight that thing is from the front, especially if it's paired with her usual smirk. You try not to have a heart attack by sticking your head in your planner. Pretend to be busy, Jenny, you tell yourself, pretend not to even notice her. It's not like she'll say hi to you or anything, she hasn't in the month and a half you've been borderline locker mates and she won't now. At least, she better not because this would be the absolute worst time for her to decide she wants to be your friend. And now you know Lola Perez is trouble (you've seen her get detention 3 times already and she's always strolling into school with a coffee or a smoothie or something vaguely alcoholic) and even if you had friends, she wouldn't be the kind of friend you had. Not that you think she'd want to be your friend. You own two laminators and wear your student ID on a lanyard. You're probably the kind of girl Lola would bully if she bullied someone. You don't think that she does though, she seems too relaxed to even worry about bullying someone. It makes her all the more intimidating, in your opinion. \"Not in the halls, Noel, back off.\" It's not the first time you've heard her speak but it is the first time you've heard her speak so ... desperately? You guess her friend - Noel - is really bothering her. Stealing some courage, you glance up from your planner to see what he did. Your stomach plummets and your chest tightens at the sight; Noel's got his hands on her waist, tugging her towards him as she tries to pull away. For a brief moment, you think you might be sick. And then - more stolen courage, planner snapped shut, you say, \"she said back off.\" You don't sound particularly tough - you think you sound kind of like you want to cry, actually - but Noel lets go. Mumbles something like, \"was just joking around\" and tucks his hands into his pockets. Lola smiles gratefully at you and mouths a thanks. You really wish she hadn't turned around because - wow. You'd never known ponytails could look that good. Quickly, you grab the textbook you'd came for and stuff your lunchbox back into your locker. It feels a lot more childish now that Lola's dark eyes are on you. You make a mental note to get rid of it and also to never talk to her again because you think you'll pass out if she actually says something to you. A year goes by. Not talking to Lola ever again is going well since, after about two weeks, she'd gone from occasionally waving or smiling at you in the halls to pleasantly not knowing you exist again. You even manage to (mostly) forget about just how wow she looked with that sleek high ponytail. Any memories of it are just you wondering how she got it quite like that and nothing more. You're allowed to admire other girls. They're pretty - they're all pretty, that's fine for you to acknowledge. In fact, during the summer between your freshman and sophomore year you let yourself do it more often. There are flickers of doubt that it's really quite normal though you can never name what about it wouldn't be and it doesn't stop you the way that it did when you were younger. Except when your eyes go too low, like to their legs in a bikini. That's a little perverted of you, you're pretty sure. (In a way that you can place but pretend not to know about and tell yourself is just envy.) The first day of your sophomore year unfortunately involves Miles Daniels asking you if you want to \"hang out\" after school, get coffee or something. You feel like you might puke and decide you must have gotten over him over summer. Say, \"thank you for asking but I have to babysit for the Andersons today. Sorry.\" The smile you flash him is more apologetic than you feel for turning him down. It doesn't deter Miles though. Instead, he puffs his chest back out and tries again, \"how 'bout this weekend then?\" You're half sure the (very pale) color drains from your face. \"Um, I'll have to ask my parents if I can,\" you smile again. This time, it's much more anxious. You hope to God they say you aren't allowed to because you're way too nice to flat out say no to Miles Daniels. Even if you really, really don't like him. Anymore. You don't like him anymore. He grins toothily and nods coolly at you before walking off to his first period. It leaves you wanting to slam your head into your locker about eight times. You don't though, as this is school and that would be wildly inappropriate. Instead, you glance down at your schedule again, determined to memorize it by the end of the day. PARKER, S. JENNIFER 212 AP CHEM - BAUER 227 SPANISH II - GARCIA 309 AP ENGLISH - CARTER 314 GEMOETRY - MERLOS GYM P.E. - VAN BUREN 204 AP WORLD HISTORY - KAAY Almost entirely AP classes, save for the (forcibly taken) language and your senior geometry class. You wish they would print something to elaborate on that, even though you know that anyone who looked at your schedule would know. It would be nice to have that bit of reassurance. A bit braggy, maybe, but still nice. Whatever though, you don't have all day to stare at your schedule and brood about the fact that there's one detail that makes you a little upset. Not even really upset, to be perfectly honest, more ... slightly unhappy. Folding your schedule neatly and placing it as a bookmark to today's date in your store bought planner, you power walk your way over toward Building 2 for your first period. Today, you decide, is going to be a good day. First days of school are always fun for you. Your fourth period puts a dent in that positivity. It starts with Ms. Merlos' arranged seating chart. She, it seems, has taken it upon herself to ask all of your math teachers from last year whether or not you're talkative in class, and has decided to place all the kids who do talk (\"I'm not gonna call you troublemakers, but I have been informed you're some chatty Cathys\") in the front and the kids who don't talk (\"remember, this doesn't mean you're better than the kids in the front or a quote unquote good kid, just that I don't have a reason to keep a close eye on you, yet\") in the back. As in, you. Which is fine, honestly, you can work with this except you love sitting upfront and Ms. Merlos doesn't even know any of you yet and this is the supidest thing ever and you can't stop squeezing your mechanical pencil because of it. Not that you're upset. At least, you aren't upset until you see a dark haired girl tie her hair up in a really nice, kind of messy ponytail and - oh. You know that dark haired girl. Lola. Of course she talks in class. If you thought about her - which you definitely don't - you would've pegged her for exactly that kind of girl. Not because you think she's trouble (you've seen her get detention at least 8 times though, so you know that she is), she just gives off a friendly, talkative aura. To everyone but underclassmen, apparently, seeing as she's still never even introduced herself to you. And then the bell is ringing and where the hell did the time go? You barely even caught any of what Ms. Merlos said (you know it's all in the syllabus though, she'd opened with that). Did you just spend an hour staring at Lola Perez's ponytail? Oh, God. Maybe you're exactly the kind of kid who should've been seated up front. Who wastes an entire period just staring at a girl's ponytail? (Apparently, you do.) You're so busy fuming at yourself for doing that that you walk right into her like a complete dumbass. Snap out of it, Jenny, you reprimand yourself as you all but whimper an apology to the taller girl. Lola smiles at you like she doesn't have a care in the world, laughs lightly, like air, says, \"it's chill, dude,\" and leaves the classroom with a smoothie in hand that you hadn't even noticed. Where the hell did she get that and why would she bring it to class? You may have spent the period distracted by her but you're pretty sure the syllable must have something against that. How did she not get into trouble? (Maybe Ms. Merlos heard that gentle, raspy voice and couldn't even bring herself to give Lola a warning or whatever. It's certainly making your knees feel like jelly.) Your parents ask you about school again. You say you made friends and don't even mention that Miles asked you out (you've forgotten completely, really). Do your homework, get dressed again, tie your hair up even tighter, and then you're out the door, taking your bike to the Andersons. Trey is too nice (you tell yourself it's not flirting and that if it is, he'll grow out of it soon), AJ is adorable as always, and Bobby has you taste test his homemade cookies. You don't think about fourth period except how terrible it is that Ms. Merlos put you in the back. Things go ... better than you'd expected after that. Miles doesn't bother you again after you tell him your parents said you couldn't but you think Billie Jensen is available, you stop staring constantly at Lola's ponytails (instead, you steal three glances every ten minutes and spend the rest of your time diligently working like the good student you are), and you make more than decent cash babysitting. Plus, not that you're surprised by this or anything, your grades are superb and you make the honor roll after first semester, just like you'd been hoping for. So of course, it's right then, when you feel on top of the world and like nothing could bring you down, that something has to go obnoxiously wrong. It feels overtly comical and like something out of a movie when it happens, too. Probably because God wants to make your suffering entertaining or something. Right when things are beyond peachy keen, Ms. Merlos pairs you with Lola for a project. It's not a major project or anything like that but you're still going to have to talk to her and work with her and look at her and you really, really, really don't think you can do all of that. Lola, however, seems to have no issues with being partnered with you. All casual smiles and conversation, like she has no idea her very presence is making you feel like you swallowed a golf ball but it got stuck going down your throat so now you kind of just can't breathe and feel vaguely uncomfortable and incredibly embarrassed. Then again, she probably doesn't. There's not really a good reason for her to think she would have that affect on you (aside from the obvious fact that she's drop dead gorgeous) and you're still not entirely sure why she does. That doesn't make you any less irritated with how she keeps talking (no wonder she sits in the front of the class, you almost think Ms. Merlos ought to put her in the front row) and she just won't shut up. It's friendly and well intentioned but you can't focus and how dare she not know how flustered she's got you! Besides, you already knew you didn't want to be friends with her and you doubt she actually wants to be friends with you. This is probably just her way of passing time without whipping out her phone which you doubt even she could charm her way out of detention for. That thought does it for you, really. \"Could you please shut up?\" you sigh, completely exasperated, \"I will literally do this entire project and just slap your name on it, please just -stop talking. If you keep talking I'm going to screw up and fail and have to go to community college and become a garbage man and I really don't want that.\" \"Whoa, dude, chill out,\" she laughs, doesn't take you seriously, keeps talking. If her voice wasn't so ridiculously attractive, you would completely forget how pretty she is. Still, you're beyond fed up with her now. You don't even feel bad for being rude now. What kind of person doesn't understand what shut up means? This time, it tears it. \"Oh, my god! I will stab myself with this compass if you don't stop! Seriously, please just let me do this project in peace! I'll write your name on it, just - oh, my God. Stop. I will stab myself in the ear.\" Her arms cross over her chest, her face less friendly now but still not mean. She leans back, kicking her feet up on the metal bars of her desk, chuckles, \"ella necesita ser follada.\" Your Spanish isn't perfect by any means and her annoyingly perfect accent as well as the rate at which she speaks (then again, you guess you shouldn't be surprised by that seeing as her name is Lola) makes it hard for you to understand, but you at least know she's talking about you. \"I heard that,\" you say, \"I take Spanish you know.\" You reach into your bag, pretending to be searching for a pair of scissors but instead pulling your phone out to Google that list bit, momentarily forgetting that Spanish spelling is definitely different from English spelling and Googling \"sir folada.\" Lola snorts at that. \"It's ser foyada - \" she puts a heavy emphasis on the \"ya\" sound, \" - and it means you need to get fucked.\" The blood rushes to your cheeks at that. Hand shoots up, urgently needing to get away from Lola (and the thought of sex because God, that's just humiliating). \"Ms. Merlos, may I switch partners?\" The answer is a firm no and the closest thing to a glare Ms. Merlos has ever given you. You should've asked the moment you were partnered with Lola. Instead, you bow your head with shamefully red cheeks and are sure to spell her name wrong - Lollah Perez. There. That's good enough revenge, even if you do feel more than a little mean for it. You're not the one telling girls you barely know they need to ... to get fucked. The thought leaves you unable to help but imagine your lips trailing down Lola's jaw, carefully working the exposed skin of her neck, lower, lower ... you squeeze your legs tight together and wish you were anywhere else. This was not at all how you wanted to be forced to consider the possibility of you being gay. Not that you are. Because you're definitely, definitely not. And especially not for Lola Perez. (Entirely unrelated to any of that, you decide you like Bryce Nolte two periods later.) Lola is kind of furious when you get the project back and she sees her name so horribly misspelled. Gets out of her seat and marches down to you, says, \"so my name is Loyah now, huh?\" with her eyebrows narrowed and her nose crinkled in a way that would be cute if you weren't still mad at her for what she said. You brush it off as casually as you can in class because you don't think she'll cause a scene right in front of the teacher. Even manage to coolly say, \"sorry, babe, total accident, I probably wouldn't have missed it if you had shut up the first time I asked.\" The bell rings before she can say whatever her retort is but her mouth is twisted open angrily and you really, really hope what she's going to say doesn't get meaner with a period to think about it. Maybe you shouldn't have misspelled her name so badly. An extra L could've been a genuine mistake, especially since she no doubt thinks your Spanish is abysmal now, but an H? That was probably too far. Great. Now you feel bad. You get to your locker to grab your sack lunch and Lola is already there, ready to make you feel worse, no doubt. She does, of course. Her rant is in rapid fire Spanish and you catch only a few key points - she calls you a gringa and the gist of the whole thing is about how gringas apparently lack respect for the Spanish language and something about racism and white people not caring about people of color's names which just makes you feel like a total jerk because that's not how you meant it at all. You don't think intent matters though, especially not when Lola finishes her rant with a vehemently growled, \"babe\" and slams your locker shut before marching off. That weekend, you watch three documentaries about modern day racism and read twelve articles. You decide to write out an apology for the name thing but only that, because you're still pretty sure you were totally in the right with telling her to shut up, even if you did kind of say it meanly. You slip the apology into her locker and the only sign you get that she read it is that she doesn't glare daggers at you or hiss out the word babe like she wants to kill you again. Which, you suppose, is fine and dandy. It makes you feel a lot better, at least. You hope that's not selfish because you really did feel bad when she told you, even if you barely understood her. She still doesn't talk to you at all though (not that you ever made an effort to talk to her either), so you guess you're back where you started. Except at least now you're a little more socially aware. And you have to pretend not to know why you can't stop staring at her ponytails in class. You're not gay though. Not gay gay at least. Definitely not. As in, no way in a million billion years could you possibly be a lesbian. (Right?) You like boys. You have to like boys. You definitely like boys. (There's also just the faintest chance you like girls too. Or maybe just Lola. But you totally doubt it because there's just no way - not that you think there's anything wrong with girls liking girls, it is 2015 after all. You just don't like girls. Or Lola.) For the first time in your life, you get a B. In geometry, too. Apparently the staring system you worked out should definitely not have been used on any tests. Your parents aren't mad at all because they're your parents and they love you and \"honey, don't cry, a B is still great!\" but you're furious. At Ms. Merlos for seating you in the back, at Lola for always tying her hair up in fourth period, at yourself for staring at her for it. Mostly at yourself. You really can't blame anyone else for your grades. You can try (and you really do try) but it doesn't work because, really, it is your own fault for staring. Still, you can't help but sulk around your locker more moodily than ever when you catch sight of Lola there and mumble incoherently under your breath about how it's her fault (it's not, you know this of course). If she notices, she says nothing. Doesn't even look at you unless you're standing in the way of someone she wants to look at. That only makes you sulk more. It's childish, sure, but you can't help but want her attention even though you know that if she gives it to you, you'll push her away. (Part of you is reminded of how your parents told you once that when little boys do things like pull on your hair it's because they like you and don't know how to deal with that. The rest of you ignores that because you're pretty sure you shouldn't try to hurt the people that you like and that, once more, you don't like Lola.) The rest of the school year goes by and the most Lola says to you is \"sorry, dude\" after her friend (boyfriend?) runs into you while chasing after his friend. And then she graduates. You see her at the ceremony. You go for your TA in English because she'd been nice to you and was the closest thing you'd had to a friend all year (really, since the entire time you've been in school). She hugs you and you congratulate her and walk with her to the parking lot. She invites you to some restaurant with her and a group of ten but the thought of being with that many people, especially ones you don't know, terrifies you so you tell her you've got plans tonight. It's not until you're walking to your bike that you see Lola. This time, some boy (the one who ran into you) has his tongue down her throat and she's holding on tightly to a camera, not looking particularly into him or the kiss. She pulls away laughing as he says something that sounds a lot like \"you bit me!\" \"Say cheese, Nico!\" she snaps a picture of him, hand to his lip and mouth half open with spit dripping down his chin, \"you're so photogenic, wow.\" You can't tell if she's being sarcastic or flirting or both but you feel like you're intruding on something you shouldn't as you speed walk past them to your bike. Your cheeks must be bright red because your face feels like it's burning. It's just embarrassment, Jenny, you tell yourself, you saw two people making out - that's embarrassing. And normal. Totally, definitely normal. Lola doesn't let you just walk past her. \"Hey, kid, I didn't know you had senior friends,\" she grins toothily and you suddenly feel very welcome to the idea of being eaten alive. Or in other ways. God, that's disgusting! \"Oh, uh, yeah, um, Rosie, my TA,\" you say, the anxiety hitting you like a ton of bricks as you try not to chew the inside of your cheeks too hard. \"Rosie Jaruegi? She's so uptight,\" Lola's laugh sounds like - you're not sure what actually, you've never heard anything like it. It dazes you a bit and then her camera is up again and she's saying, \"hey, smile for the camera.\" Your face must be bright red, your ponytail slightly askew, and your mouth stupidly half open. Lola smiles softly at the result anyway. Almost fondly. But then again, you're not really sure what fond smiles look like and you're probably just wishing she would smile like that. \"Catch you later, kid,\" she laughs as the boy - Nico, you think she said his name was - tugs her away by her waist. For a second, you wonder what just happened. Then you recompose yourself. She called you kid twice, probably doesn't actually remember your name - or knows you keep staring at her and wants to remind you she's too old for you. She was making out with a boy seconds before she said hi to you. She took a picture of him too. Come to think of it, you've seen Lola take lots of pictures of people. Maybe not just for the yearbook. Yeah. That's probably it. Lola just likes photography. You pretend not to know why that disappoints you so much. Junior year goes by with little to no trouble. Exams are hell but your grades are impeccable. You don't make any friends but you have a study group now, at least. Your art TA is super nice to you and gives you the good brush when she passes them out. You run into Lola once, at the mall and don't say anything to her (she doesn't recognize you, you think, she must have a hundred friends to remember and you were never one of them). You build a relationship with Professor Anderson through babysitting her kids. No boys talk to you, except Zac Chase who's nice and friendly and would never date you. You like him, of course. Because you're a girl who most definitely only likes boys, even if those boys never seem to like you back. It's just bad luck. It's not like you intentionally choose to like boys who you have no chance in hell with. You'll date later. Like after college. A few years after college. You've got time. (Worst case scenario: you learn to pretend to like dating boys.) Oh, one actually interesting thing happens your junior year. You get diagnosed with ASD, which, you suppose you should've figured out on your own considering the fact that social cues make almost zero sense to you and you get so frantic about things being done a certain way. It's not a huge deal though, at least you don't think so. The photography internship isn't even something you actually need, to be perfectly honest. Your application is already fantastic without it (though you still need that recommendation letter). All it is to you is a cherry on top of the beautifully decorated cake. Maybe a little bit of security to make sure you extra stand out, or to make up for that one B (that Ms. Merlos refused to let you to extra credit or anything to boost, honestly you think she hates you), but nothing needed. Still, you put your portfolio together as neatly as you can and arrive perfectly on time and without a wrinkle in your outfit and with your signature ponytail. You deserve to go to a nice college and this is a great opportunity for you. Besides, photography is fun! You hadn't expected to see Lola though. She's got a smoothie in hand and camouflage pants on and for the briefest second, your heart flutters because she looks just like she did that first day in geometry, just minus the ponytail. And then she thinks you're Mr. Vasquez's assistant and you can't help but be totally offended. Fine though, if Lola doesn't recognize you then you don't recognize her. Her head cocks after you correct her, like she's putting a puzzle together. Mr. Vasquez's actual assistant comes out before she can say anything though. He takes both your portfolios (hers is apparently still wet which just seems unprofessional to you) and tells you to have a seat. Apparently Mr. Vasquez is \"having an artistic moment.\" Not that that actually makes any sense. Lola takes a sip from her smoothie after practically lying down in the chair. Says, \"hey, did you go to Hyland Park?\" \"Yes,\" you try not to tap your fingers against your knees, \"I still do.\" Now she remembers. \"You were that nerdy sophomore in my senior geometry class!\" there's a grin on her face. You're not sure if it's reminiscent or fond or - actually, you just can't read it at all. Nerdy. Of course that's what she thinks of you. She's Miss Badass, who doesn't care at all about anything and wears like eight necklaces at once apparently and brings smoothies wherever she pleases. Someone like you, who actually abides by rules and keeps their wardrobe organized and tidy and thinks smoothies are messy, must look like a total loser in her eyes. You correct her anyways, because you're not nerdy you're just smart and dedicated and you skipped a grade. All it does is make her judge you which only serves to make you even more anxious and leaves you rambling about your achievements and how this internship is going to look great on your college application. Judging by the look on her face (and the words out of her mouth, \"transcript? That's why you're here?\"), that wasn't at all the right thing to say. You're hasty to add that you do like photography - you like it a lot, actually, way more than you'd expected to - it's just that that's a bonus. \"Right, right,\" she says, the disdain even clearer than her skin (seriously, what is this girl's skincare routine?), \"well do you wanna know what I did my last year before college?\" \"You were accepted into college?\" It's a mean thing to say but you're pretty sure that she's either going to drive you crazy or anger you into doing something stupid (like kissing her, maybe, her mouth is still really pretty) if you're not as mean as you can be to her. Which, granted, isn't actually all that mean. She lets out a fake laugh which faintly reminds you of her actual laugh. You miss that sound but keep your gaze as judgmental as hers. \"I could've been - \" of course, she didn't go to college, you figured she talked in class way too much for that \" - you see, a real artist is a student of life - \"what does that even mean? \" - anyway, an internship with Leon Vasquez would fast track my career as a photographer.\" Professor Anderson calls and interrupts her, she's in need of a babysitter but you're booked for the night. Lola seems to find that hilarious - until she finds out how much babysitting makes you an hour. The look on her face leaves you feeling smug until she reminds you, sharp tongued as ever, that unlike you, she has a life. Thankfully, Mr. Vasquez comes out and you don't have to try and tolerate Lola any longer. (Seriously, you can't even see why you thought you liked her now that you've fully conversed with her.) You're not so relieved when you accidentally knock into Lola and she spills her smoothie everywhere and you both drop your phones. Or when Mr. Vasquez says he needs to see even more work from both of you by Monday to know who he's going to give the internship to because it's just really inconvenient when you have to babysit for the Coopers tonight. And then it gets even worse when your phone rings except it's not your phone at all because you don't even know what that ringtone is but it is most definitely not Beethoven. Which means Lola has your phone and you have hers and you don't have enough time to get it back before you head to the Coopers'. Plus you have no idea whatsoever where Lola lives or if she'll even answer if you call the phone. But you're totally not freaking out because you're a reasonable person and you're at the Coopers' already and you can absolutely get your phone back tomorrow. It's not like anyone is going to call you to hang out anyway. As much as that stings to remember, it's a good thing. You won't miss anything important and things will be just fine. You're sure of it. Things are not just fine. The anxiety gets to you a little while after the Coopers leave and you decide to call your phone. Lola doesn't pick up but AJ Anderson does. Apparently, Lola is babysitting. And putting out a fire. You're in your car with Emily and Katy within four minutes and at the Andersons' in less. The first thing you see is Lola, in a modest bathing suit that very much suits her tanned skin and with her hair pulled up, banging on the front door with her camera in hand. The urge to yank her around by said ponytail (in the least kinky and most heterosexual way possible, of course) rises in your chest. You don't though, instead you demand to know what in the world she's doing. \"Babysitting, obviously,\" she scoffs like everything is handled and she's not half naked on the porch of the woman you very much need a recommendation letter from. Once you get inside, it's a mess and all Lola does is tell the kids to clean as she takes a picture. Because, obviously, this mess she caused needs to be documented. Then, because things need to get even worse, Emily asks where Trey is - and Lola doesn't even know who Trey is. Emily goes up to his room and finds the window wide open. His tablet tells the rest of the story. He bought a concert ticket from a pawn shop and sneaked out with a friend (older, no doubt, able to drive and yet still making terrible life choices - just like Lola). You round on Lola immediately for letting a 14 year old sneak out to the city without any supervision to go see a concert. Even worse, she's using your name to do all of this - no doubt she recommended herself while posing as you and now Professor Anderson is never going to write that recommendation letter and your whole entire life is ruined and you have to become a garbage man. Except - \"he has to pick up the concert tickets, right? I can drive into the city and get him.\" \"I know the city, I'll get him,\" she sounds so casual and unaffected by all of this. It kind of makes you want to smack her or yell or something. \"You're the one who lost him,\" you snap. Her voice is still perfectly even, like she didn't hear the break in yours, \"relax, girlfriend, I'm just trying to help.\" That's the last straw. (Not because you're gay and it flusters you - absolutely not.) \"I'm not your girlfriend!\" you say, the panic even more evident now. You realize that could make it sound like you are gay and are just in denial to the kids so you're quick to add, \"I'm not your friend, I don't even know you!\" Except you do. You were almost-locker-mates for two years and you stared at her every day she wasn't absent in geometry for a year and you yelled at her for talking too much when you were paired together and you misspelled her name on purpose like you hadn't memorized it (hadn't ever thought the name Jenny Perez sounded kind of pretty) and she yelled at you and you wrote a note on nice paper to apologize and she has a picture of you with red cheeks and a half open mouth and you draw a girl who looks a lot like her when you're bored sometimes. But ... you guess that doesn't really count because you never really tried to talk to her until today. The kids take it, at least. It's blackmail material for them to get in the car with you. The car that definitely can't be yours or Lola's now because that many people won't fit so ... that leaves Professor Anderson's brand new SUV. At the very least, you don't let Lola drive because she does not seem like she would be a responsible driver. At all. Lola retaliates by complaining about your driving speed. And taking a very unflattering picture of you. Like, probably worse than the photo she took of you at her graduation but she apparently doesn't know that because she barely recognized you. Your heart kind of flutters at the knowledge that Lola Perez has used you as a model twice now. Even if you look awful in both photos. You pretend not to notice that this time she smiles a little differently at the result. She's probably just mocking you this time, anyway. Oddly enough, Lola doesn't say another mean or even kinda petty thing the rest of the drive. Instead she takes to assuring the kids that you guys aren't total strangers or anything, you had geometry together and your lockers were nearby (you can't help but smile at the fact that she remembers that before you remember that she's terrible and all of why you had to steal a car), you just didn't talk to each other. \"Because I was like, way too cool to talk to nerdy sophomores, you know? I think we got paired on a project once though, pretty sure she threatened to stab herself if I didn't stop talking. Or maybe that was another nerdy blonde chick.\" The grin on her face is completely teasing, you're pretty sure. But you aren't friends so you just whine and insist once more that you aren't nerdy, you're just dedicated. She laughs at that (so do the kids). Her laugh is just as nice as you remember it. You're still mad at her though. The pawn shop, as it turns out, is in a horrible, grimy part of the city that almost gives you a panic attack. Thankfully, Lola is already unbuckling and volunteering to go in. My hero, you let yourself think, even if this whole thing is her fault. But of course you can't be allowed to stay safely inside the car and Katy has to pee and Lola obviously cannot be trusted with children so you'll have to go inside with her and Emily, Bobby, and AJ definitely can't be allowed to stay inside the car all by themselves so they have to come inside too. Really, why can't anything go your way? Even just once would be nice. That's probably Lola's fault too. Well, no, you suppose she couldn't have made Katy have to go to the bathroom but still. Your luck is about fifty times worse than normal around her and you absolutely cannot stand it. Or her, and her really pretty eyes and easygoing smile which doesn't even fade from her lips inside the pawn shop which is even more horrible and even grimier than the part of the city that it's in. Lola is so nonchalant about this all, like she does this every day (you really hope she doesn't) and it really just makes you that much more anxious and stressed out. She lets you hide behind her in fear as she deals with the beyond shady employees like they're nothing. Even though, you know, one of them is armed. And called The Scalper! For the briefest second, you think it's kind of chivalrous of her to do this for you. Kind of like she's your knight in shining armor. Except that's stupid and you're totally straight and into Zac Chase and if not for Lola, you wouldn't even have to be here right now, cowering behind her because she's dealing with some guy called The Scalper. That gets the anger inside you back up. Not enough to like do or say anything though because you don't want to get scalped. Your fear comes back so fast it could crush you the moment some weird, possibly rabid animal escapes and everyone is screaming and oh, God the kids (you yell for them to stay away from that thing and grab whichever ones are closest to you to pull them away to safety) and Tiny and The Scalper are chasing that thing around and Lola is trying to get a picture. Jesus Christ, what is with that girl and pictures? She's gonna get killed someday over that camera! (Thinking that just makes you anxious for her because even though you're mad at her she doesn't deserve to die.) She gets her picture once Tiny gets his weird, possibly ferret animal thingy. Even though you know she heard him tell her not to take pictures. Oh,oh. He really meant no more pictures. You find yourself exasperated and scared and mad all at once, saying, \"Lola! No means no!\" like you're at some college rape seminar. And then, amidst the chaos (because you can't seem to escape that today), you spot Professor Anderson's car. Being towed. You're out the door with the kids and Lola in seconds, chasing the tow truck. She finally stops for you and tells you it's $100 to get the car back. That might put a bit of a dent in your savings but that's totally affordable thanks to all your years of babysitting, at least. Except you left your bag and consequently your wallet at the house. And Lola is broke, hence why she lied to get a babysitting gig. And then, well, your other options are children and your ice cream fund. So the not so nice lady drives off and into the giant puddle, completely soaking Professor Anderson's brand new car in mud. Because just saying no to you guys wasn't enough. Maybe Lola really is bad luck for you. Once you've got your game plan mapped out (take the bus to Mario's, get Trey, and go from there), God or whoever's up there decides to make your night just a little worse (because that's necessary, of course) by sending Tiny and The Scalper running after you. This time, you freeze in terror and so Lola has to yell out what you all need to do. She keeps it very simple, sticking with a for once not totally relaxed yell of, \"run!\" You're definitely out of breath once you reach the bus stop. P.E. was never your favorite class and you always preferred speed walking to running but, hey, at least no one got scalped. Lola even helps you get onto the bus. Where you promptly find out via the bus driver Carl that you're $2 short for you all to ride said bus. Her reaction is immediate, like she's done this a hundred times before. She starts talking, voice just slightly lower than normal, and it sounds so charming you let her grab you and smile and wave timidly when she introduces you. And then she blames you for being $2 short of the fare and is quick to divert the conversation to Trey with an even lower, kind of pouty tone that kind of makes your knees weak until you realize she's pretending to care about Trey. \"Don't pretend to care about Trey - honestly, Carl, she doesn't care about anyone but herself,\" you say, all your previous anger building up again. She scoffs at that, eyebrow cocking up to challenge you. \"I care about a lot of things, Carl - \" you're starting to feel bad for Carl, it's like he's a child caught in the middle of his parents' argument \" - like art and expression and photography! I bet she didn't even know who Leon Vasquez is until today.\" While not quite right, Lola is infuriating close to the truth, which is that you hadn't known who he was until you read about the internship. \"I did too! I read all about him!\" you snap back, wishing she wasn't almost right. \"Oh, please,\" she sneers, \"I saw your portfolio, it's as stiff as you are. Where'd you learn to take pictures, sweetheart, your computer?\" If you weren't so mad at her for talking to you like this when it's all her fault, you'd be humiliated that she called you sweetheart in public. Instead, you stumble over your comeback as best you can, \"where'd you learn all the snappy sarcasm, we know it wasn't college.\" Even Carl is sick of you two at this point. At the very least, he's sick enough to let you ride the bus despite the $2's owed. Lola snaps another picture of you, this time telling Carl you'll pay him the $2 some other time and looking like you want to cry as he yells. You're starting to think she just deeply enjoys getting pictures of you where you look bad. She smiles a little more softly at the outcome this time though. Leans a little closer to you, so her mouth is at your earlobe, and, with the corners of her lips curled up in what's now a smirk, says, \"by the way, I learned from my family. Latinos love to roast each other.\" The feeling of her breath against your skin makes you shiver. She chuckles at the goosebumps she elicits and your cheeks go a deep shade of red. You're starting to get a little less certain of your sexuality. Just a little. Trey hits on you when you get there and one of his friends says you're hot. It makes you want to crinkle up your nose in disgust which doesn't really do much to help the \"I'm straight\" argument you spent most of the bus ride trying to build. Except, Trey is a baby and you're pretty sure his friend is too, so you decide they don't even count in either argument. And then Trey also very much perks up at the sight of Lola, who's quick to express her disdain with crossed arms and what you imagine is her best authoritative voice. You ridicule her despite the fact that you admire her no bullshit stance because you can't let her think you're not mad at her anymore just because she made you blush. Trey pays no mind to that, still eager to go to the concert as if you'd ever let him. Especially now that he's sneaked out. Besides, you've got bigger issues - like the towed car you need $100 to get back. And then Lola kind of strikes gold - \"wait that's it, why don't we just scalp Trey's concert ticket to get the cash for the car?\" It doesn't make you less mad at her for causing all of this but you do have to give it to her - once you clarify what she means, at least - that is a good idea. You're not entirely sure about the legality of that but you don't exactly have a lot of other choices. Plus it's kind of really cool how she gets Trey to agree by essentially blackmailing him. Like, it's not cool because blackmail is wrong but she makes it sound so reasonable and responsible which you definitely like. Not that you'd tell her that though, or that it changes anything. Well, maybe it changes a few things. You at least trust her to not let any of the kids die while you take Katy to the bathroom now. You kind of wish you'd let Lola take Katy to the bathroom though. At least, once you hear some girls from school (all way too cool to talk to you but nice enough to say hi in the halls) talking about Zac Chase taking Dominique Cassidy to the concert. Dominique is really pretty and nice and the thought of Zac at the concert with her ... doesn't actually upset you that much. Not once you accidentally shout no at hearing he's taking her, at least. They leave the stalls in seconds, say hi and that they didn't expect to see you here ever. Then they ask who you're here with and, while you probably could just say Lola's name because they look like they're cool enough to know who Lola is, the thought of admitting you're here with Lola and just Lola (because you definitely can't mention the kids you're babysitting) makes your throat close up. What if they thought it was a date or something? What if they thought you were gay? That would definitely be worse than them thinking you have no friends (which you don't). So you lie. Really badly. And then Katy needs your help and you pretend not to know her but tell her you'll help her find her mommy and get out of there as fast as you can. In tune with the rest of your day, embarrassment is not punishment enough for whatever you did to piss God off and the kids are nowhere in sight and neither is Lola. You're shouting for AJ when Lola decides now is a good time to pop up and take yet another picture of you. At this point, you're just mildly annoyed by it (and think it's just a tad endearing that she likes taking photos so much, especially photos of you). \"Lola,\" you groan, \"where are the kids?\" She doesn't look up from the camera lens as she answers, \"uh, specifically? I don't know, around.\" Trusting her with them was a giant mistake. \"Are you out of your mind?\" You ignore that she mumbles possibly in reply as she adjusts the zoom on her camera. \"Babysitting rule #1: never take your eyes off the kids!\" Quickly, you locate them throughout the restaurant. All except for Emily. Oh, God, where is Emily? Apparently, you said that out loud because Lola answers (way too casually, as per usual), \"uh, she's getting a tattoo.\" This girl is definitely out of her mind. Emily comes back a few moments later, though. Safe and hopefully ink-less seeing as she's 14 which is way too young for tattoos. She's all smiles as she shows off the henna the tattoo guy apparently gave her free. You hope to God it will wash off as Lola grins and takes a picture of it. You reprimand he, voice flustered, and she tells you she'd asked Lola who doesn't even deny that Emily did (though she does say it as though she'd forgotten it happened until it was brought up). \"Lola ... Lola is nobody, okay?\" Ignore the way she looks like a kicked puppy now that you've said that. \"You can't just wander off like that. Something could have happened to you! You are my responsibility and that better come off with soap and water!\" There's not enough time for Emily to respond or for Lola to even say a screw you for calling her nobody like that because Bobby is yelling for you and Tiny and The Scalper are back. You grab Trey and Lola's ushering the other kids out the back door of the restaurant before anyone can even explain to him what's happening and - oh crap, there's no way out of this ally unless you can climb the fence. \"Over here!\" Lola shouts, pulling a door open. You end up hiding behind some machine, you holding onto AJ in fear and her with her hands protectively around Katy. You think Trey's got Bobby and know Emily is by your feet but all you can do is stare nervously at Lola's hand, vaguely wishing she'd hold yours and tell you it's alright. She doesn't. What she does do is suggest you all hide in the clothes being moved throughout the building to escape Tiny and The Scalper. It's definitely not hand holding and it doesn't ease your anxiety at all but it might just get you all out of this alive and un-scalped. Alive and un-scalped definitely sounds like something you want so you agree to it even though you think it's absolutely insane. It works. Kind of. They spot Lola amongst the clothes but they can't exactly reach any of you from down there and you're sure there's a door or something somewhere for you all to escape out of. You just have to focus on not crying and running the second you can. And not letting any of the kids die because that would be awful - and if you let one of them die, Professor Anderson would so not write you a recommendation letter. Mostly the first bit though. The kids, for their part, are all laughing now after mocking Tiny and The Scalper and then getting off the conveyor belt thingy with help from you and Lola. You suppose now that you're not just dangling up there it is kind of fun. Dangerous, completely irresponsible, and not something you ever want to do again but fun. And then you're standing at the edge with what must be at least a twenty foot drop and it's not so fun anymore. \"We can't get around this, guys,\" you say, already thinking of a million ways Tiny and The Scalper might kill you all to get Lola's camera, \"there's no way out.\" \"Yeah there is,\" Trey tugs at the chain in front of him, a grin you definitely don't like on his face, \"there's an awesome way out.\" The other kids (and Lola, who lets out a laugh that makes you nervous) seem to like that idea a lot and it's not like you can think of anything else right now, let alone anything better. You end up watching the kids jump down, gripping the chain for dear life, one by one until it's just you and Lola, who shrugs and says, \"ladies first\" before nudging you towards it. You wonder briefly if maybe she's scared to jump. \"Ready?\" she asks as you grab the chain. You're not actually sure what you say as you jump but you hear the familiar click of her camera and you realize that, no, she wasn't scared, she just wanted another picture of you. You blame your racing heart on the fact that you just jumped about twenty feet and into what might be dirty laundry. There's a mess of noise and your head is kind of spinning from that and then - \"Here I come!\" she shouts. You roll over so she won't land on you but still need a moment before you can get back up. She doesn't laugh but she doesn't sound dazed or freaked out when she speaks next. In fact, she sounds more excited than ever as she exclaims, \"let's go sell that ticket!\" You almost giggle but you still feel vaguely like puking so you don't risk opening your mouth as you clamber out of the bin you've landed in. At the concert, she entrusts her camera to AJ instead of you and you can't help but feel a bit offended. She doesn't even say anything when you call after her to tell her you'll be waiting for her by the taco stand. Maybe she's still mad about you saying she was nobody and for her being chased by bad guys and escaping didn't bond you guys enough for that to be forgiven. If she is, that is kind of your fault. More than kind of. That is definitely your fault and you have to apologize to her when she sells the ticket because that was a total jerk thing for you to say, even if you were upset with her. Except you might have to wait longer than you thought to apologize because you're pretty sure Lola is getting arrested now. Your heart plummets from your chest and down below your stomach at the sight. AJ, however, laughs and says she bets Lola will want a picture of this. You're sure she's right but holy shit Lola is getting arrested and you have to save her because her selling the ticket is your fault - you should've been the one selling it or you should've called Professor Anderson and explained everything but you shouldn't have let Lola break the law like that what were you thinking? Before you know it, you're all the police station and you can vaguely hear your surprisingly good attempt at sounding calm as you're asking the lady at the front desk about Lola who is apparently getting booked which, again, is all your fault. You hardly know what's happening aside from the fact that you're repeating your usual mantra to calm yourself until Emily's beanie comes off and you see her hair is green which is just one more thing for you to be stressed out about and responsible for. You think maybe you accidentally take your frustration out on her which you feel bad for but you're going to have to apologize for later because Lola is what matters right now. Two derby teams are brought in and you think AJ is at least meeting her hero which makes you smile just a bit. You're still absolutely terrified for Lola and for yourself and for the kids because you have no idea what to do now. But then Lola is coming out with some - some ugly guy you already hate and you go from complete depression to absolute panic because you've seen documentaries about police brutality and racial profiling and if any of them touched her or even looked at her wrong you are going to kill them because Lola does not deserve that. Nobody does, of course, but least of all Lola. The kids are all hugging her and she's smiling so wide you think her cheeks must hurt but you don't say anything or go to hug her just yet because this feels like their moment. You can worry about her the second they're all done hugging. And worry you do, the second an officer rushes you all out because AJ accidentally started yet another derby fight, your eyes are on her (hands feels like too much, you don't think you should invade her space like that), checking for cuts or bruises or misplaced hairs on her head. \"Lola, are you okay? Did they hurt you? Was it scary?\" you don't take a single breath and Lola just grins even more at that. \"No, I'm totally fine,\" she says breathily. The thought of her going through that and being fine makes you almost gape at her. \"Fine? You just got arrested!\" That came out angrier than you meant for it to. You swear you meant to burst into apologies and \"I was so scared for you\"'s and \"thank you for being okay\"'s. \"It's fine, Jenny,\" she sounds annoyed now and that only makes the apology in your throat even harder to spit out, \"it was no big deal.\" That tears it. You wish it didn't but it does and now you're saying how you have to call Professor Anderson before it goes any farther (which honestly isn't a bad idea at all and you probably should've done that to start with) and the only sorry issued is to the kids because you have to call their parents now. And then Lola is arguing with you again and she's got that look in her eyes like fire and you can't do anything but fight back. You don't even pause when AJ starts trying to get your attention, you barely even hear her. \"Uh, hey, you guys!\" It's Bobby this time and you and Lola both shout a little too angrily to ask him what it is. It turns out things are going too far again and AJ is rollerblading away from Tiny and The Scalper. You all immediately try to get the attention of the police which might be the most rational decision of the night. Except they're still trying to break up the fight AJ accidentally started and it doesn't look like they're getting anywhere. Lola is definitely bad luck for you to be around. You're sure of it now. Bad luck who wants to steal Tiny and The Scalper's car. If there was a better way to make sure those guys don't hurt AJ, you definitely wouldn't let her, even with her \"it's borrowing\" argument. Unfortunately there's not so a second grand theft auto gets added to the list of tonight's crimes. All thoughts of apologizing are out the window when Lola not only steals the car (with your assistance, God) but drives completely recklessly so you throw in a quick, \"kids, this is not how a responsible babysitter behaves!\" Lola is too worried about AJ to even say something snarky back. She almost hits someone (The Scalper but still someone) except she doesn't and you don't even berate her for it because you're too stressed out about the fact that AJ could break a lot of bones if she's not careful. Lola accidentally butt dials Professor Anderson but she handles it (not great but better than you would have) and then AJ kind of knocks The Scalper on his ass and you're all piling out of the car and going through a door in the back ally, not really caring where it takes you. Once you're far enough inside, she's asking AJ if her camera is okay. Of all things, she cares about her camera. How selfish could someone be? You can't believe you were going to apologize to her. \"You're worried about your stupid camera?\" you ask, the agitation uncensored in your voice. Hurt flashes across her eyes for a second as she clutches it close to her. \"It's not stupid, I won this in my first photography contest - this camera is proof I have talent,\" she says, her voice softer than you've ever heard it. You dismiss her anyways. Sentimental value means nothing compared to the lives of the kids she's definitely endangered by not just giving those stupid men her stupid camera. It's not until you're onstage and have tripped over a plug that you realize you should've been paying more attention to where you were going than to how annoying Lola is because this is kind of a huge audience and you doubt they'll just let you go without some kind of repayment. It turns out (according to Lola at least, but you don't think she would lie about this - or at least, you hope she wouldn't), they want you to rap. Which you've never done in your entire life. You don't even think you've ever listened to rap. Not anything heavier than a verse or two in a catchy pop song on the radio, at least. Trey hisses that you need to say something and Lola tells you to be creative so you take a very deep, very scared breath and introduce yourself first. The worst that can happen is you fail miserably and they boo you off the stage which is still pretty bad but you've almost died like three different times tonight so it's not as scary as it would normally be to you. Plus Lola definitely had a rap song as one of her ringtones (you have no idea why she felt the need to set different ones for different people but power to her or whatever) so worst case scenario, maybe she could save you. Or is it racist for you to assume she can rap? You don't even know anymore. You get into the beat faster than you'd thought you would and decide to explain what happened, starting with introducing Lola as a real ... witch. You don't want to swear around children, after all. The whole thing flows better than you would have ever expected, especially the bit where you vent about how Lola is ruining your life (you leave the fact that she's entirely too sexually confusing for you out). It's actually really fun. You're starting to see why Lola just lets go so often for sure, this feels great. Over the music and the chanting of the crowd, you vaguely hear Lola and Emily murmuring. Something about \"she's really good\" and \"yeah but she's super white\" (which is definitely not false) and then Lola's up in your face, rapping significantly better than you hard (and going for things a lot more personal, but you're pretty sure that's just how Lola is). There's no real venom to it, not like there had been that day you spelled her name Lollah so you let yourself laugh as she completely roasts every aspect of yourself (there's one reference to you being scared to sound gay which you don't even know how she figured out but it's nothing more than that, except Lola definitely just made it sound like maybe she's gay which makes your heart kind of stop). Really, the whole thing is just one big joke at this point as she lets you grab her camera out of her hands and pretend you could ever match what she just put out and wraps an arm around you, laughing that beautiful, beautiful laugh of hers. She even gives a big, goofy smile when you finish the rap with a selfie of you, her, the kids, and pretty much the entire club. You think that means you guys are good now. Or at least, you really hope it does because you would very much like to not fight with her anymore. That thought kind of vanishes when Trey points out Tiny and The Scalper to you and you grab her hand to tug and pull her away. Thankfully, the crowd stops them to hear their story too and you can all pause a moment to laugh about how fun this was. Lola even compliments you. It makes your heart kind of flutter. A couple blocks later, she's still laughing about how proud she is of you as Emily skulks behind all of you miserably. Lola notices before you do and tells you to talk to her, her hand gently resting against your shoulder. Oh crap. You'd totally forgotten about how you yelled at poor Emily in the police station while you were all stressed out. You apologize the best you can and make sure to tell her how wonderful she is - and that if Trey somehow doesn't see that, that's his problem. You leave out the part where you honestly don't understand what she could possibly see in Trey or any boy, really, because that's probably just a you thing. You do, however, tell her that boys are dorks. It's as close as you feel like you can get to \"boys are disgusting\" or \"boys aren't worth liking.\" And then Emily tells you she kind of called her mom and told her you stole a car and got them all arrested. Some plotting and an inspirational quote combined with eye contact that leaves your knees weak later, you're all safely inside the gala and ready to pickpocket your employer. Granted, you did not account for it being an event to honor the woman you need a recommendation letter from, but still. You suppose this is as ready as you'll ever be to steal anything, let alone $100. Bobby ends up working in the kitchen, Trey and Emily are left in charge of AJ, the coat with the $100 needed to get the car ends up back in Mrs. Cooper's possession, and Katy swipes a fur coat and a pair of glittery heels to disguise Lola with so she can go steal the $100. She tops off the disguise with red lipstick, Mrs. Cooper's diamond earrings, and her tiara and - oh. Lola's hair is barely up at all and it's definitely not in a ponytail but ... wow. She almost looks better like this. You can't believe it's humanly possible to be that beautiful. Even when she almost falls flat on her face because of the heels, she looks gorgeous. This, you realize, is definitely not envy. The only thing you envy right now is that coat for getting to be so close to Lola. You don't even pretend not to have realized that as you throw Lola's inspirational quote right back in her face with wide, sparkling eyes. It makes her smile so you think it was definitely the right thing to say. Part of you wonders if she knows what you're thinking about right now but she's gone before you can try and work up the courage to ask. And then Tiny is trying to steal her camera and you really are not about to let him or anyone else take this from Lola because you may have dismissed it when she told you but this stupid camera means the world to her and Lola definitely deserves the world. More than the world, really. It doesn't hurt to start with her camera though, and not letting thugs steal it. Thankfully, the ferret thingy from earlier bites The Scalper and in the confusion, you and Katy manage to get away, find Lola, come collect the remaining kids, and escape without getting caught and, thanks to Lola, with an extra $20 to get to the tow yard. You can't help but grin and congratulate yourselves on what a good team the two of you make. There's something about how soft Lola's smile gets as she echoes your words that makes you pull your phone out for a selfie. Maybe it's just how you're smiling and how pretty Lola is but you think the two of you look really good together. Not really couple-like, of course, but just ... nice. Happy. Like you've known each other forever, like maybe you're best friends. You think being best friends with Lola would be pretty cool, actually. (You might have to remind yourself not to think about kissing her neck every now and then, but aside from that you definitely think you'd like it.) \"I can see why that guy asked you to that concert,\" she grins. And then you remember. Right, of course. You have a crush on Zac Chase and you need to know if it was him that asked you to that concert because he's there with Dominique Cassidy. Even ask you ask for clarity, voice cracking and tears threatening to spill from your eyes, you don't know if you would have said yes if he'd asked you. Babysitting aside, you don't think you could picture yourself there with him. The music would be too loud, the band not even one you like, the crowd way too big, Zac too ... Zac. The thought of being next to anyone but Lola tonight is baffling after everything you've gone through in the past few hours. She hails a taxi to get you to the concert to see him anyway. Says she's making things right and the look in her eyes tells you you couldn't possibly change her mind right now. She's doing this for you. The thought makes you cry a little bit. Lola wipes the tears away with her thumb, whispering how sorry she is for rejecting Zac with your phone and her hand on top of yours. The notion makes you feel as if she lit you on fire but you don't tell her you like this better than you would have ever liked some stupid concert. The seven of you reach the concert with maybe eight minutes left in it and no ticket in your hand to get inside. Lola, quick witted as ever, immediately asks the security guard (or whatever he is) what it'll take to get you guys inside. He eyes her for a moment and you feel something inside you hiss. If he says her you think you'll add murder to tonight's list of crimes. Thankfully, he doesn't ask for that. He does, however, ask for her camera. Worse, Lola goes to give it to him. You can't let her do that. Not for you, not after all the terrible things you've done to her. And you tell her that, tell her it means too much to her because you know that camera is her world and eight minutes of a concert and a stupid boy are not worth that. You're not worth that. Lola doesn't agree. She looks at you with soft eyes and says that it's a fair trade even though you both know it isn't. The only way it could ever be a fair trade was if you meant the world to her, and you know you don't. The two of you have only just reached a point where you're friends and there's not a chance in hell ten minutes of your friendship means that much to her. It might mean the world to you but Lola isn't like you. She's had probably a billion friends and the uptight, nerdy blonde girl who spelled her name as Lollah and called her a nobody couldn't possibly mean all that much to her. That doesn't stop her from trading her camera for you though. Once you're inside, Katy and Lola rush you to the bathroom so they can make you look less ... you. Katy instructs, telling Lola to give you some of her many, many rings after putting lipstick on you. Lola pulls your coat and sweater off without even having be told though. Somehow, it leaves you feeling even warmer than you had with them on. You try not to think too much about that, especially when Lola goes to her knees to tie your flannel and your heart kind of stops. Then your hair is down and Lola is smiling at you like she smiles at her photography and you feel kind of like art. Until she pushes you to the door the concert is behind, at least. You'd almost forgotten this was all happening so you could get the boy you might not even want. The concert ends though, apparently you wasted all the time you had getting made over. Part of you is relieved but you still ask them what you do now. Naturally, they tell you to go in and get the boy anyway. It's humiliating and not at all what you want but you do it anyway. It's like your body is on autopilot and you're just watching yourself shout for Zac Chase and get up on a stage and find him and - you don't even know what you say to him but apparently it kind of works. In all honesty, you have no idea how you actually end up at the tow yard. You think Zac drove after you (or Lola? Someone did) explained this mess of a night to him. You think Lola sat in the back while you sat shotgun but kept her hand on your knee the entire drive anyway. You think Zac didn't notice the way you held your hand over hers. You think Bobby did though because he gave you a look like he knew something you didn't. Try not to think about it. Now isn't the time anyway, seeing as the not so nice lady who towed Professor Anderson's car is locking up. Is it midnight already? You and Lola both yell out and run to her. She complains about her night and how you shouldn't mess with her right now. It kind of makes you snap. \"You've had a rough night?\" you seethe, teeth barred. She's not even fazed by the anger in your voice as she goes to shut the gate once more. \"Yeah, so don't mess with Trixie,\" she scoffs. Catching the gate, you shove it open. \"Don't mess with the babysitter!\" This time, she takes you seriously and takes the $100. You're all back in Professor Anderson's car in no time at all, this time Lola rushes to the driver seat. She grabs the keys from your pocket with a wink as Zac gets in his car. \"This time I'm driving, and we're listening to my girls Fifth Harmony,\" she grins toothily. AJ and Bobby both let out an excited whoop and Emily tries to hide a smile. \"Okay since we have Harmonizers in the car, do you guys wanna start with Juntos or Reflection - don't worry, Jen, they're both PG,\" she says. \"The song or the album?\" Bobby asks at the same that Emily is too quick to vote for Reflection. Lola pauses for a moment, like she's thinking, \"the song, if we listened to all of Reflection we'd have to skip a bunch of songs or Jenny would tell on us.\" Her bottom lip sticks out in a mock pout at that last bit and you can't help but laugh. \"Hook my phone up to the car.\" You do as your told, and find the song quickly but not without letting Lola know you've only heard one Fifth Harmony song and it was not PG at all. You leave out the part where your face was red for ten minutes after hearing it at the mall. Judging by the look on Lola's face, she guesses the last bit anyway. And then she's singing along and dancing as well as one can dance while seated in a car. \"I must confess,\" AJ, Bobby, and Emily are all singing with her but you can definitely hear her voice the clearest. It's as nice as her speaking voice which is totally unfair. \"You looking fresh,\" she winks straight at you and your face goes red. \"Eyes on the road!\" you yelp, trying to keep some dignity. The next ten minutes pass like this: Lola and (most of) the kids sing along, Trey pretends not to know the words, everyone but AJ, Bobby, and Lola who apparently both are fluent pretend to speak good enough Spanish to sing along to Juntos, Lola flirts (?) with you through song, and you blush furiously about Lola possibly flirting with you and hope you aren't imagining it. You don't even really think about the fact that that would definitely make you gay because, honestly, at this point you're pretty sure you might be. (Okay, you are. You totally, completely are and you're going to have to explain that to Zac because he's being so cool about everything and he's so nice.) Then Lola's phone rings, interrupting the jam session. \"Who is it?\" she asks,for once keeping her eyes on the road. \"Uh,\" you check the screen, squinting a bit, \"your mom.\" Her face goes pale. \"Oh, shit,\" she hisses. You reprimand her for her language but she doesn't even acknowledge it. \"Uh, answer it - not on speaker phone, just tell her I'm driving right now.\" So you do. But before you can even say a \"hello,\" Lola's mother is yelling so loud the whole car can hear her. \"Lola Karla Perez Zendegi!\" she exclaims (AJ, Trey, and Emily snicker slightly at the use of her full name), \"where have you been? Do you know what time it is - and don't you dare dude me!\" \"Um ... I think you should talk to her,\" you all but whimper, pulling the phone down from your ear and putting it on speaker. \"Lola? Who was that? Who are you with? Was that - \" a small gasp, \"oh, hija, did you get a girlfriend?\" For the first time (that you've seen at least), Lola's face turns a bright shade of pink. \"Mom! No! I'm with my friend, Jenny - \" her mother lets out a hum that sounds more than slightly disbelieving \" - I can't talk right now, I'm driving but I'll explain when I get back, okay?\" Her mother sighs dramatically, \"hija, you know - your stepfather may have some ... issues with your sexuality but you don't have to lie to me. It's alright if you're with your girlfriend, I still love you the same as I did when you went out with those stupid boys - dios mío, Lola, your taste in women better not be the same as in men.\" Lola is practically squirming in her seat now. She looks ready to be put out of her misery so, deciding that it would be better to end this quickly than prolong the suffering with further denial, you pipe up, \"um, no, I'm nothing like her - her ex boyfriends. I would love to get to know you, ma'am, but we really do have to go. It was nice talking to you though!\" With that, you hang up quickly. The look Lola gives you is somewhere between grateful and bewildered so you shrug, face made up like a deer caught in headlights. Trey is the first to speak once the album resumes. Says, \"no wonder you won't go out with me\" with the biggest grin on his face. You think maybe he understands and it feels like a weight was lifted off your chest - until the other kids are all laughing, at least. Then you realize it was a joke and that nobody understands because you've spent so long pretending it's not true. Once the laughter settles down, you clear your throat nervously, fidgeting with Lola's phone in your lap. \"So,\" you start, \"you're ... gay.\" \"Incredibly so. Why? That a problem?\" Lola's voice is guarded, her grip on the steering wheel tight. You blanch at that, \"n - no. Of course not, I mean, it's 2016 and - um. Sorry. I'm just ... I thought you ... liked boys.\" \"Funny,\" Lola sneers with no venom, \"I used to think that too. But I thought I made my sexuality kind of clear tonight. Even if I did kind of flirt with that cop - I thought it was obvious I just wanted out of jail though.\" She seems almost amused, like you're totally missing something, but you have no idea what that is. Unless - \"oh, the rap battle ... yeah, I guess you did.\" Lola cocks an eyebrow as she stares at you for a moment. You feel too vulnerable and exposed under her gaze to even tell her to look at the road. What is it you're missing? Judging by the faces of the kids, they all get it. Are you really the only one who doesn't? You all arrive at the Andersons' safely and before the parents and then split up to clean the mess Lola made before you take Katy and Emily (whose hair is no longer green and who no longer has henna on her arm) back to the Coopers' with Zac. You're sure to hug Lola goodbye before and tell her you'll call her tomorrow though. You want to be her friend now, you definitely want that. And maybe a little more. But if Lola's blatant lack of feelings for you didn't already seal the deal on you two only ever being friends, you do once you're at the Coopers'. Instead of explaining to Zac that you're gay gay (lesbian feels like too much for you to handle seeing as it's taken you 17 years to even admit to being gay - but you are, you definitely are) and apologizing and thanking him for everything, you completely choke and ask him out. Even worse, he says yes. The next day, you make the selfie you took of you and Lola your phone's background and buy a coat definitely too big for you but just about Lola's size. You call her and completely lie, tell her that something you ordered online finally came and it's way too big for you but hey, maybe it'll fit her. If she knows you bought it just for her, she doesn't say anything when she swings by your house to pick it up. She also doesn't say anything about Zac, but she does tell you that she's been roped into a date with the police officer she flirted with and asks how you think she can completely ruin it. The truth is, you don't think Lola could ever make a date unpleasant. You don't say that though, instead you invite her inside and the two of you plot together. She sits on your bed with her legs on top of yours and her tied up. The sight makes your heart hurt and you find yourself only able to sneak glances at her because she's so beautiful - it's completely unfair. After an hour, a stomach rumbles. It's yours, because you hadn't eaten breakfast this morning like a moron. An embarrassed and sheepish smile slides across your lips but Lola just laughs. The sound is still beautiful, just like her. \"Sounds like someone could use some pizza, I'll order,\" she chirps. Then she pauses a moment, \"unless you're not okay with that and I'm overstepping some boundaries.\" There's something like fear in her eyes which you think definitely doesn't suit her. You shake your head no, of course. Say, \"you're totally not, pizza sounds great. Do you want me to pay?\" Lola makes a face like she feels terrible about saying yes but you very clearly remember her lying to get a job babysitting because she was in desperate need of cash so you add, \"it's totally fine. Seriously, don't feel bad, I have like tons of money from babysitting that normal people would've spent on like, going to the movies or something.\" \"You are normal, Jen,\" she whispers, \"I know I made fun of you but ... you're not weird. Okay? And, um, thanks for this. Next time it's my treat, got it?\" She looks so tender right now, eyes all soft and her usual smirk gone from her face. You can't help it. You don't kiss her because you're not crazy but you do snap a picture of her with your phone. Call it taking a page out of her book. Lola laughs when she realizes why you took a picture and tosses a pillow at you. You wish you could stay in this moment forever. Then you decide that once she leaves, you're going to withdraw your entry for the internship. She definitely deserves it more than you. Plus you're pretty sure it's the least you can do. Lola traded her camera for you, you can trade an internship for her. Not that you don't think she would have won anyway. After you end things with Zac, Lola gets the internship, and Professor Anderson sees the photos proving that you guys did a lot more than just get ice cream, you spend a lot of time with Lola. Instead of stressing out about early admission (because Lola was definitely right, that is not fun and you deserve to have some time to just let loose), you take to helping Lola prepare her own college application. It's kind of short notice and Lola's grades aren't the best (they're not the worst either, really, she's more just an average but highly intelligent student who gets easily distracted because, as it turns out, she has ADHD) but you advise her to start with a year at community college and then transfer to an art school once her GPA is up. It's completely doable and, as you assure her, it doesn't make her stupid or in any way less than. After Lola's college issues are sorted, the two of you spend all your efforts on Professor Anderson, in hopes that she'll still write your recommendation letter. It turns out though that Trey, Bobby, and AJ have all been explaining away that night and justifying both of your actions since she saw the pictures so, while Lola is definitely never babysitting for the Andersons again, you're still welcome to. Just not at night. You do note that your recommendation letter is not as impressive as you think it would have been before that night. Oddly enough, you aren't even that upset about it. Meaning you almost had a panic attack about it but Lola held your hand and told you it was still a great letter of recommendation and that you're still totally, overwhelmingly impressive to any college, regardless of the stupid letter. She seems to be doing that a lot lately. Both the hand holding and the calming you down. It definitely makes you happy. It takes until February for you to do something about it. By now, your feelings are definitely stronger than just a crush. You still can't fully look at her when her hair is tied up because she's like a goddess, but you don't just get butterflies and defensive about her now. You love things about her, love pretty much everything about her and even find the things you don't love (like the way she's willing to eat food off the floor and basically bullies you about your low tolerance for spice) absolutely endearing. Not to mention that you try to fight everyone who says anything bad about her at all. She's had to pick you up to stop you from going after three different people now. You feel weird saying you love her but you do care super, super, insanely deeply for her and would rather die than let anything bad at all happen to her. (So, yeah, you definitely love her. You're probably in love with her at this point. You've got it bad.) You've kept it under wraps since the two of you officially met in November though so you're pretty sure you can keep this a secret until your feelings go away. Except, you think you've kind of had feelings for her since the day you saw her so that means you've been stuck on this girl for over three years. And you kind of want to kiss her all the time, especially when she wears her hair up like she's doing right now. It probably doesn't help that Lola is smiling right at you. God, even just the sight of her smiling makes you blush. You're a mess, Jenny, you groan internally, who gets this flustered about a girl smiling? Lola, of course, picks that moment to snap a picture of you with her (brand new and very improved) camera. (You'd tried to track down the security guy to get her old camera back but you've had no such luck yet, unfortunately.) She smiles adoringly at the result and looks up with just her eyes to say, \"you know, Jen, you're actually pretty cute when you're flustered.\" \"So I'm not always cute?\" You want to hit yourself the second you say it because that sounded way too much like flirting and you're like 99.9999% sure Lola does not see you that way. Like, not even a little. Instead of making fun of you for flirting with her though, Lola grins toothily at that. \"Normally I'd say you're more ... \" she pauses for dramatic effect as she sets her camera down on your coffee table, \"drop dead gorgeous.\" Your face turns an even darker shade of red at that before you remind yourself that this is Lola. Lola who flirts with everyone. Lola who, seriously, shamelessly flirted with the concession's stand guy at the movie theater when she doesn't even like boys. She definitely doesn't mean it like that. Except she's kind of biting her lip and looking even more like a goddess than normal and - oh no. Oh no. You're kissing her. Your mouth is on her mouth and her lips are really soft and you're kissing her. Except not quite kissing, it's more your mouth is on hers super chastely because you're a moron who can't even kiss right. You pull away quickly, your face burning up more than you thought was possible (and Lola has made you blush really hard so that's saying something.) \"Did you just ...\" she trails off, for once at a loss for words, \"but - um. Whoa.\" \"I know,\" you manage. \"Um - I'm - yeah, sorry about that, I totally read that wrong and should not have done that, like at all. It was super inappropriate and if you never wanna talk to me again, that's cool.\" At that, Lola looks at you like you've grown a second head. \"Who said that? I'm just ... surprised ... dude,\" she clears her throat nervously, \"um ... I just - I thought you weren't ... interested in me ... and that maybe this - I mean, us would be weird because of the age difference.\" You've never seen Lola so shell shocked and so red. \"So you're interested in me?\" you squeak out. Lola nods furiously, like she's completely humiliated by this whole thing. \"And, um ... you didn't make a move because of the age gap?\" Lola nods again. \"Y'know, um, it's not - you're not that much older than me. Like, you're not even a full two years older, actually. My birthday is August and yours is October, I mean. I know it might feel kind of weird because I skipped a grade but, um, my parents had me do preppy kindergarten as well as, um, regular kindergarten so I'm still 17. I don't think, um, that we would be ... weird,\" you're definitely rambling now. This time, Lola doesn't nod (that wouldn't make any sense, anyway). She clears her throat once more. Says, \"yeah but ... I - when I was 17, I was really dumb and way too young to date a 19 year old so like ... I dunno, it just felt weird knowing I felt this way about you.\" You laugh a little at that, \"I'm not you, Lola. I'm at a different place than you were when you were 17. And I'm almost 18. I think I'm old enough that this, that we aren't weird together.\" She cocks her head at that, like she's contemplating your words. You kiss her, again. Not on accident this time, and you remember how kissing actually works (according to everything you've ever read, at least). She stumbles back a bit before her hands find your waist and she melts into the kiss. Her forehead rests against yours when she pulls away, her hands not leaving your waist and yours not leaving her shoulders. For a moment, the two of you just breathe. You don't know about her, but you try to memorize this moment. Your first real kiss. The warmth of her lips. The feeling of her hands molded to your waist. The smell of strawberry-banana smoothie on her breath. Lola. You could get used to this. She breaks your concentration, her voice a whisper. \"Okay ... but - but no sex, or anything. Not until you're ready. And you have to tell me if I do or say anything that makes you uncomfortable, okay, Jen?\" Your face goes red at that but you answer anyway, \"right ... no - no intercourse. That won't be a problem. And, um, I will.\" An endearing laugh escapes her lips at that. Her fingers squeeze your waist lightly, playfully. She nuzzles her nose to yours tenderly. Says, \"yeah, no intercourse, Parker. Mm, maybe I should wear my hair up less often, make that easier for you.\" \"You knew?\" you whisper yell. Lola laughs again, less endearing, more amused. \"Mhm, you were pretty obvious, especially that first time,\" she murmurs, \"I didn't know that you actually had feelings for me though. I figured you just like got off to the thought of me with my hair up or something.\" Like she can sense how humiliated you feel, she changes the topic, \"you know, it's a good thing you basically just begged me to be your girlfriend. My mom still thinks we're dating and she kind of wants to meet you.\" This time, you laugh. \"I think I'd like that,\" you whisper. \"I think you like me, Jenny Parker,\" she grins, \"don't worry though, I think I like you too, girlfriend.\" She practically purrs the nickname and you can't help but remember the first time she'd called you that, how angrily you had denied it in fear of the kids finding out you're gay. The thought makes you giggle. \"Well I'd hope my girlfriend likes me.\" Girlfriend. You could definitely get used to that.

BeautifulnKate Davies, just her name was enough to make him melt. He had knownnher since the 3rd grade and he had loved her ever since.nShe didn't known of course and he was alright with not telling her.nHe didn't want her to feel uncomfortable and to make theirnfriendship go down the drain. After all Kate was the only girl innschool that was nice to him especially within her group of friends. There was Shelly, the intelligentnone, Lily the wild party girl, Paige the sexy one who boys droolednover and Dorothy. Not much could be said about her. She was the girlnin the shadows, the big one but still well known because of hernfriends. Kate was the popular one, the one every girl admired, thenone he loved with all his heart. Honestly he loved all her friendsnbut he loved her the most. He wanted to ask her to the dance but henfigured it would be a lost cause since the group usually went tondances together. It was frustrating since he really wanted her to benhis date but he wasn't at a complete loss. He would ask her tondance and she could even decide to hang out with him. \"…everyone needs a partner,\"nwas the last thing he heard his teacher say before all the studentsnstarted moving around. Jeremy didn't bother getting up, he knew nonone would want to be his partner, no one ever wants to partner upnwith him. \"Hi Jeremy,\" says a soft voice.nHe looks up into the sparkling eyes of Kate Davies as she smiles atnhim and sits in the desk decides him. \"Is it alright if we benpartners, Dorothy isn't here today.\" Jeremy nods repeatedly andnadjusts his glasses. He watches her continuously as the two work onntheir English project that he wasn't really paying attention to. Hencouldn't believe his luck. He, Jeremy Melton was sitting down nextnto the most popular girl in school and it was because she wanted tonbe his partner. He silently thanked god that Dorothy wasn't atnschool. He was sad when the bell rang fornlunch and everyone started packing their things. He helped Kate putnall the supplies away and she thanked him for staying and helpingnher. \"Bye Jeremy, I'll see you at the dance,\" she says as shengrabs her bag. \"Yea, at the dance, bye Kate,\"nhe says. She smiles and walks out of the room and he watches as shenwalks away with Paige. Later at the dance he watched asnPaige, Shelly, and Lily talked to two others girls giggling andndrinking pop. He didn't see Kate around yet. Jeremy decided to benbrave and ask go up to the three and ask them to dance. He stood upnfrom his chair and slowly inhaled then exhaled then made his way overnthe girls. He decided to ask Shelley first. He tapped her shouldernand she looked at him, her smile turning upside down. \"Shelley, would you dance withnme,\" he asks. \"In your dreams loser,\" she saysnthen turns away. The girls laughed and Jeremy turned his attention tonLily. \"Umm Lily, would you dance withnme,\" \"Ewww,\" she said disgusted.nJeremy hung his head low and walked off. Then he turned to Paige. \"Umm Paige, would you dance withnme,\" he asks. \"I'd rather be boiled alive,\"nshe said eyeing him angrily. \"Get loss geek,\" said Lily.n\"yea,\" said the others. Jeremy slowly nodded and walked awaynsadly. It was then that he saw Katenstanding alone by the punch bowl drinking some juice. He smiled as hennoticed how pretty she looked in her white dress. He walked up to hernand she watched him with a smile on her face. \"Hi Kate, wannandance,\" \"Maybe later Jeremy,\" she saidnkindly. \"Ok maybe later,\" he saidnbrightly. She giggled and he waved bye as he walked away over to thenbleachers. That's when he saw Dorothy. He went up to her and shenlooked at him puzzled but smiled when he asked her to dance. He heldnout his hand and she took it standing up and following him to thendance floor. The danced to one song then went behind the bleachersnwhere Jeremy leaned in and kissed her. She kissed back and the twonheld each other as they made out. Four boys saw then from where theynwere standing and crept over to the bleachers looking down at thentwo. \"Check it out, thick and thinngetting it on,\" says one of the four boys. Jeremy and Dorothynpulled away quickly and stared at them. The two recognized them to benthe school bullies, David, Robert, Jimmy, and Jake. They alwaysnteased Jeremy and on occasions they would also tease Dorothy, callingnher buffalo because of her weight. \"Oh man that's nasty,\" saysnJimmy. \"Ya like it buffalo getting hot,\"nsays Robert as he pulled on his shirt glaring at her. \"Stop it get away from me,\"nDorothy then screams as she pulls her hand away from Jeremy. \"Is this pervert at it again, didnpervert attack you,\" asked Robert. \"Yea he attacked me,\" saidnDorothy. \"Pervert jumped buffalo,\" saidnRobert as he run off grabbing the punch bowl. \"I..I..I didn't know,\" criednJeremy. \"Pervert,\" Dorothy tells himnwith a evil glare. Robert passes the punch bowl tonDavid who then pours the whole thing on Jeremy. The boys laugh andnDorothy and Jeremy look at each other for a second before she runsnaway frightened leaving Jeremy standing there wet and humiliated. Hisnnose begins to bleed and the boys jump down from the bleachers andnbegin grabbing and pulling on his clothes stripping him down to hisnunderwear. Jeremy runs but Robert catches up to him and trips himnmaking him fall flat on his face. The other kids then stare and startnchanting fight as the four brutally kick Jeremy over and over.nShelley, Paige, and Lily all begin to laugh and start calling him anpervert while Dorothy stands behind them slightly ashamed. Kate runsnup with a teacher who separates the boys from Jeremy who know laysnunconscious. When Jeremy wakes up he notices he'snin the nurses office on the small plastic bed. He sits up and hisneyes widen as he sees that Kate is sitting in a chair next to himnleaning forward with her head on the bed and her eyes closed. Hensmiled, happy that she cared enough to stay with him. He hated allnthose boys especially Robert. He didn't know why they constantlyntortured him, it wasn't like he ever did anything to them.nNevertheless they still insisted on punishing him every chance theyngot. Not only did he hate them but he also hated Dorothy for lyingnand getting him beat up. He didn't understand why she would try tonplease those boys when they called her worse names than they callednhim. Whatever the reason was, he didn't care. He would never againntry anything with her as long as he lived. As he took one last look at Kate andnbrushed a strand of hair from her face, Jeremy took her hand in hisnand laid his head back down. Hopefully tomorrow would be better thanntonight had been.[Chapter 2] 7th grade seemed to gonthe same as 6th, as did 8th and 9th.nSophomore year of high school Jeremy was still the geek of the schoolnand Kate, Shelley, Paige, and Lily were still the popular ones withnDorothy as their friend but with less attention as the others. Jeremynwas the same as ever and was still very much in love with Kate. Everynday in homeroom he would sit and stare at her while he drew portraitsnof her in his notebook. He would also offer to help her in anynclasses that she was having difficulty with. Kate appreciated his help andnremained the kind person that she had always been but the othersnfound him more annoying than ever. Dorothy tried to get her to stopntalking to Jeremy always referring back to the time when he attackednher but Kate would then remind her how he kept apologizing for it.nDorothy though didn't seem very willing to accept his apology.nThough underneath she knew it was actually him that should be seekingnher forgiveness. Friday morning when Jeremy walkedninto the library he found that Kate was sitting all alone instead ofnwith her four friends. He smiled happy that he now had a chance tontalk to Kate without her friends around to bug them. \"Hi Kate,\"nhe said as he sat down next to her. \"Hey Jeremy,\" she said. \"What you doing,\" he asked. \"Oh just trying to get ahead onnwork since the girls aren't here. They decided to ditch today,\"nshe said. \"Ditch…and you stayed,\" hensaid a bit quietly. \"Yea I have a test today and Indidn't want to miss it especially since I've been studying for itnall week,\" \"Well, since your friends aren'tnhere, would you like to hang out with me today?\" he asked. Katentook a minute to think and for a second Jeremy thought she was goingnto say no but his frown was turned upside down when he heard her saynyes. The two spent lunch together in thenart room and after school they walked together to the ice cream shop.nThey talked and laughed so much Jeremy's eyes began to water. Hencouldn't believe he was hanging out with the girl he had lovednsince the 3rd grade. Kate also couldn't believe hownfunny and caring Jeremy was. She was now glad that the girls hadndecided to ditch. Though it would be a storm later when they foundnout she had hung out with Jeremy she didn't really care. She hatednthe fact that her friends had always picked on Jeremy when he was onenof the sweetest guys she had ever met. She had had lots of fun withnhim and wasn't planning on pretending that it never happened. While the two walked home togethernit slowly began to rain. Kate took out her umbrella and covered bothnher and Jeremy who unfortunately didn't have one. \"Silly Jeremyndidn't you know it was going to rain,\" she said smiling. Jeremynlooked away and blushed and Kate laughed and wrapped her arm aroundnhis pulling him close. Jeremy heart began to pound loud and his nosenbegan to bleed. Kate noticed from the corner of her eye and stoppednand pulled him into an alley where it was dry. She set her umbrellandown and took out a napkin that was in her pocket. Jeremy watched hernfascinated as she gently wiped his nose clean. The speed of his heart increased asnhe felt her breath and his body shivered when her finger touched thentop of his lip. Unable to control his urge he quickly took her handsnin his as she finished cleaning the blood. The two stared at eachnother and Jeremy took his right hand and softly caressed her cheek.nKate closed her eyes taking pleasure in his touch and the heat of hisnhand. Jeremy saw this as his chance. He leaned in and touched Kate'snlips with his. She responded to his kiss and moved closer closing thengap between them. Just about ten seconds into the kissnthe two broke apart when the y heard voices behind them. A couple ofnguys made their way over to them whistling at Kate and tauntingnJeremy. They looked to be around their age and they looked liked theynhad just been smoking with the smell of cigarette flowing aroundnthem. Jeremy moved Kate behind him as if to defend her and the guysnlaughed. \"Hey baby, why don't you leaventhis loser and come hang out with a real man,\" one of them said. \"Sorry I don't see any,\" spatnKate. \"Oh so you got a mouth on thatnpretty little face of yours,\" \"Yea and a brain so get lostncreep. Come on Jeremy,\" she said taking Jeremy's hand. As soon asnJeremy turned the same guy grabbed him and pulled him backnforcefully. Jeremy fell to the ground and when Kate tried to help himnanother guy came up and grabbed her pulling her away. Kate screamednand when Jeremy tried to get up he was kicked in the face then in thengut. His glasses fell off and the guy that kicked them stomped onnthem and kicked the broken pieces aside. As the guys kept beating Jeremy,nKate struggled with the guy holding her trying to break free so shencould help Jeremy. She repeatedly stepped on his foot and tried tonelbow him in the gut. She got him to loosen his grip and she quicklynrun out of his arms and shoved one of the guys kicking Jeremy intonthe wall. One of the other guys then punched her in the face and Katenfell to the ground unconscious. Jeremy's eyes grew red and in thatnsecond something snapped in him. As quick as lightning he got up andnstarted fighting each of the guys. He got a broken beer bottle andnswung it scratching the guy who hit Kate in the face. The two boysngrabbed their friend who was now bleeding and ran off freaked out bynJeremy who had murderous eyes on his bloody face. Once they were gonenhe ran to Kate and took her in his arms protectively rocking her backnand forth.[Chapter 3] The next day when Jeremy didn'tnsee Kate he realized she must have stayed home. He didn't blamenher. He would have stayed home also but he didn't want to have tondeal with his parents who were more of a bother than any of the kidsnin his class. As he walked down the hall trying to make it to hisnmath class someone pushed him into the lockers hard. It was Paige andnshe was standing in front of him with Dorothy, Shelley, and Lily whonall had mad looks on their faces. \"The principal wants to see you,\"nsaid Paige. \"And it's not good,\" finishednLily. Shelley stepped in front of Jeremynglaring at him like a tiger. \"Your finished Melton, you can kissnthis place goodbye,\" \"What,\" he said confused. \"Don't think we don't knownwhat you did to Kate,\" \"You don't even know whatnhappened,\" he said defending himself. \"Oh, look who's trying to actntough,\" laughed Paige. \"We already know what you didnpervert,\" said Dorothy. \"Hey girls what's going on,\"nsaid Lily's boyfriend Rick as he put his arm around his girlfriend.nWith him were two other guys, the same one's that had humiliatednJeremy at the 6th grade dance, David and Robert. \"This guy causing trouble again?\"nasked Robert. \"Yea he keeps hitting on us,\"nlied Shelley. \"And he attacked me again, thenntried to attack Kate yesterday,\" said Dorothy. Jeremy couldn't believe what henwas hearing. He had never done any of those things and he would nevernhurt Kate. He made a run for it before Robert and David could getntheir hands on him. It was useless though. He knew he would still getnin trouble because Robert's mother was the principal and there wasna good chance that he would be suspended. Not that he was completelynworried. Suspension wasn't as worse as being kicked out andnhopefully that wouldn't be his fate. It was later in the afternoon whennJeremy got home that he saw his mother and father sitting in thenkitchen with a man in a black suit with a briefcase. The three lookednat him and before they could even say anything Jeremy knew what wasngoing on. The news soon caught on that Jeremynwas headed to reform school and everyone seemed to be happy about it,nexcept for Kate. She hated that he had to leave and was a bitnsuspicious about the fact that he had been kicked out because ofnanother attack on Dorothy. She knew he would never do something likenthat, just like she knew he had never hurt Dorothy at the dance. Shenhad seen them kissing and while she felt happy that Dorothy hadnsomeone she couldn't help but feel a bit envious. After all she didnalways have a soft spot for Jeremy. The first few weeks in reform schoolnwere hard for Jeremy. The fact that he could no longer see Kate'snface tore him into two. He didn't have a picture of her. Hisnparents hadn't allowed him to take anything with him except a fewnclothes. They had thrown all the rest of his stuff away and weren'tneven there they day he left to his new school. They basicallyndisowned him and threw him out like garbage. Jeremy didn't mind itnso much though, since he never really liked his parents anyway. He never got any mail and no onenever came to visit him. He started writing letters to Kate though hennever figured she would write back. He would write one every othernday and after a week she replied back. The two wrote to each othernback and forth for about two months telling each other about schoolnand all that was going on. Kate would tell Jeremy about the girls butnshe said she never told them that she wrote to him. It made him happynknowing they had a secret that she hadn't told her best friends. Itnmade him feel like she cared for him like he did for her. It came asna surprise when after 2 months of being at reform school he gotncalled up to the office because he had a visitor. He walked withnsecurity over to the cafeteria and there he saw a girl with blondenhair with her back facing him. Jeremy got excited believing it to benKate but he stopped when he realized it wasn't Kate but actuallynLily. He sat across from Lily and for anminute neither said anything. They engaged in a staring contest eachnlooking at each other with eyes of hate. \"Why are you here?\"nasked Jeremy rudely. Lily took the bag that was next to her andndropped it on the table in front of him. Jeremy looked through thenbag and saw all of his letters that he had written to Kate. \"Whatnare you doing with these?\" \"I found them in her room. Shendidn't want to return them to you so I'm doing it instead. I wantnyou to ever write her another letter again. She doesn't need to benreminded of you. She has friends and a boyfriend that she's crazynabout, she doesn't need you so quite trying to make friends withnher, she's never going to love you,\" said Lily. Jeremy felt angernboiling within him, not because of the boyfriend thing; he knew thatnwas a lie. Kate had written that she didn't have a boyfriend. Henwas angered because Lily had been nosy like always and got intonbusiness that didn't concern her at all. That was all Lily saidnbefore she got up and walked out leaving Jeremy in the emptyncafeteria. He tried to control his anger and not let the thought ofnrevenge come to mind. He could no longer contain after twonweeks later when the letter he had sent Kate was returned to him innthe mail. She no longer wrote to him and though he kept writing andnkept waiting, nothing came, except his own letter which said returnnto sender in handwriting he knew didn't belong to Kate. Within time his anger grew more andnmore and after six months he was sent to juvenile hall after brutallynattacking a boy that kept picking on him during class. After a yearnin juvi he was put in a mental home for what the doctor's callednhis chaotic and disturbed state of mind. That was the last anyonenever heard of Jeremy Melton.[Chapter 4] Upon getting out of college Kate, Dorothy, Lily, Shelley, and Paige had all managed to still keep in touch though Shelley moved to a different city to attend medical school. They had all grown into beautiful mature ladies especially Dorothy who managed to lose weight in about 6 months. The change made her feel better about herself but didn't seem to be effective in finding herself a boyfriend. She didn't know if it was her face, her looks, or if she was still just too big but the constant screw up in all her dates had made her become bitter especially when she was out with Paige and Kate and men would talk to them and ask for a date or their number. Lily, now a successful business executive, had been moving from boyfriend to boyfriend, saying how she was trying to get as much action as possible until Mr. Right came along. She went through two guys in a month, and while she was with this guy named Todd for 3 months she was secretly seeing another guy named Brad whom she had met at a club. Their relationship went on even when Todd found out Lily was cheating on him and left her. Todd then began sending her flowers and cards saying how he had forgiven and wanted to give them another chance. Lily didn't feel the same though. She ignored Todd and when he confronted her one day when she got home with Brad from a party Brad ended up beating Todd until his whole face bled. Lily then told him to leave then she took Todd up to her apartment and cleaned him up. The next morning Todd woke up in his bed and found a note from Lily saying how she had dropped him off after he had fallen asleep. She went on to say how she never wanted to see him again and that if he really cared about her he would leave her alone so she could live happily. The note had upset Todd but he gave in to her wishes and two weeks later he moved out of his apartment and that was the last Lily had heard of him. Paige continued to be the sexy hard to get woman that every man wanted. She remained single throughout college having a few flings here and there. She didn't mind the single life as much as Dorothy and Lily since most of the men who eyed her just wanted her for a good time. After growing tired of a quiet apartment she moved in with Lily in a big condo just a few miles from Dorothy's house. The two went to parties continuously and when Paige got bored she took a bottle of Champaign and a glass and went outside to be alone. Shelley grew distance from her friends after moving away to attend medical school. She became more focused on her studied and less focused on her love life. She made frequent calls to each of the girls but that soon changed after a year when she stopped talking to them. Their relationship wasn't a complete lose though since she got a visit from Kate and Dorothy who came to see her during the summer. Dorothy convinced her to start dating again and she even talked her into joining speed dating just for kicks. Kate wasn't so sure about the idea but she tagged along being the good friend that she was. As for Kate, she got a job writing for the local newspaper as a journalist. She even bought a small apartment ten minutes down the road from Lily and Paige. Everything was fine in Kate's life except for her creepy neighbor Gary who seemed to have a strange attraction to her. He would always end his sentences with a word that rhymed with her name and looked at her with hunger eyes that seemed to want to swallow her whole. Kate found him creepy but nonetheless ignored him as best as she could. Life seemed to go by normally with living on her own, to hanging out with her friends and having a job she loved. Her life changed though when he walked in the elevator as she made her way up to her floor. \"Hi,\" the man had said as he stood next to her in the elevator. \"Hi,\" Kate said. \"Adam Carr, new employee,\" he told her as he offered her his hand. \"Kate Davies, welcome to the paper,\" she said as she shook his hand. \"Thanks,\" he said as he gave her a charming smile. Kate looked into his eyes and froze thinking she recognized him from somewhere. Unfortunately she couldn't picture ever seeing his face before. Adam noticed her stare but didn't say anything not wanting to blow his cover. He knew if he messed up the slightest bit she would possibly recognize who he was. Even though he had changed his face and spent countless hours working out he was still the same old boy who she once kissed back in high school. He was still Jeremy Melton. When they got to their floor Adam followed Kate as she made her way to her desk. Surprising his desk was right next to hers. \"What a coincidence,\" he said as he sat down and got settled in. \"Yea,\" Kate said letting out a small laugh. Adam smiled and watched her as she logged on to her computer and began going through papers. Throughout the day he tried to not stare at her but he was finding it a bit of a challenge considering how much he missed her and the sound of her voice. When the time came for their lunch break he thought about asking her if she wanted to have lunch with him but hesitated when another man walked up to her and started talking. Adam couldn't here what the two were saying but judging by the look on the man's face it wasn't something that he was expecting. Just as Adam got up to leave for lunch someone tapped him on the shoulder and called out his name. \"Hey\" he said cheerfully when he saw it was Kate. \"Hey, umm you wanna have lunch together, I sorta lied and told Arnold over there that we were having lunch together,\" she said. Adam looked over to the man Kate called Arnold. He was glaring at him evilly and Adam was able to put two and two together. Obviously Arnold liked Kate but she wasn't interested, lucky for him. \"Sure, I'd love to,\" he said to Kate. \"Great, let's go, I know this great place just up the road,\" she said as she held him by the arm. Adam looked over his shoulder and from the corner of his eye he could see that Arnold was still staring at him. He smirked feeling a sense of accomplishment and let Kate hold on to him as two watched out together. \"So tell me about you, Mr. Carr,\" Kate said as the two sat at a little table outside of Vito's. \"Well Ms. Davies, I'm from Seattle which is where my parents live, dad's a lawyer and mom's a teacher. I'm twenty-three I love football and baseball, and I'm single,\" he told her. Kate laughed at his last comment. \"And you,\" \"Well, I've lived here all my life, my parents live her also, my mom's a nurse and my father is a writer. I turned twenty-three two weeks ago, I have four best friends who I've known all throughout school, umm what else is there to say,\" \"Are you single?\" he asked. Kate laughed and nodded. \"Ok, tell me about your friends,\" \"Well there's Lily, Shelly, Paige, and Dorothy, and all of us have known each other since elementary. We've always been there for each other though there were times when we had our disagreements but what friends don't.\" \"So what happened to them?\" Adam asked. \"Well they all still live here except for Shelley, she moved to the next town about an hour away so she could go to med school. It's been a about a few months since I've last seen her. Lily's a business woman, an executive or something like that, and Dorothy and Paige are just doing their own thing, trying to find love and all,\" \"Well if your friends are as pretty as you they shouldn't have to look far,\" he said. \"Well aren't you quite the charmer,\" she said smiling. \"Just being honest,\" he answered. As the two talked they didn't seem to notice Paige who was just driving by and happened to get sight of the two talking and laughing. Paige was surprised to see Kate having lunch with a man but she was happy nonetheless. She quickly pulled out her phone and plugged it up to her ear piece and called Lily. Lily was in the office going through papers when she called. \"Hey,\" \"Guess who I just saw having lunch with a very cute guy,\" said Paige. \"Dorothy,\" \"You wish! No actually it was Kate,\" \"Really,\" said Lily getting up from her chair. \"Details,\" \"I was just driving and caught them sitting together laughing. Looked like a date to me,\" \"I can't believe Kate met a guy and didn't even tell us. Remind me to go to her apartment later,\" \"I'll tell her to come over after work,\" Paige said. Lily secretary walked in telling her that she had someone on the phone and set down her coffee and some papers. \"Ok thanks, Paige I gotta go,\" \"Alright see you later,\" she said then hung up. After lunch with Adam the two took a walk around the block then made their way back to the office. For the remainder of the day Adam kept close watch on Kate and somehow always found a way to start up conversation with her. Arnold watched on jealously but didn't confront Adam since he didn't want to make a bad impression on Kate. Adam was pleased to see his fellow employee so envious but at the same time he felt angry by the fact that he was interested in Kate. Even though it was clear that she had no interest in him Adam still felt the need to get rid of Arnold. Nevertheless he convinced himself that it was a waste of time. Arnold was just a kid with a little crush. If he was really interested he would have asked Kate out by now. 6 pm rolled by fast and Kate was already heading out the building. Adam had offered to walk her home but she declined when she said she was going to Lily's apartment instead. That didn't stop him from following her. He took a cab just as she did and told the driver to follow Kate paying him extra so he wouldn't ask questions. When they came to their destination he had the cab driver stop and he watched Kate get out of the cab and walk into a building that said Granit Falls. Now he knew where to find Lily. He was just about to tell the driver to drive off then he saw a car pass by him and pull up to the gate. 'Paige,' he thought. The gate opened and she pulled into the lot. 'So she lives here too,' Adam thought. 'Maybe her and Lily live together.' If so then he just killed two birds with one stone. He already knew where Dorothy lived and he had just recently discovered Kate's apartment before taking a job at the paper where she worked. Now all that was left was to find out where exactly Shelley was, then he would begin to carry out his plot for revenge.

There was never anyone as clever as her. There was never anyone as curious as her. There was never anyone as passionate and full of life as her. And so there was never anyone as angry, frustrated, and bitter. Once she learned she was to be a Marquise, she found herself well pleased with her marriage. After she had been married for two days, the young Marquise found that her title suited her better than her husband. The days in between her wedding night and the morning of the Marquis de Merteuil's funeral were a part of a time that she preferred not to remember. It was only in the hours in between the final breath of a lover's lapse into unconsciousness and the first shaft of light on the floor of her bedroom that the Marquise would find herself unable to think of anything else. Trapped between memories of slaps and reprimands ever so tentatively she would lay her hand on the chest of the sleeping man. It did not make the shadows go away, but it kept her rooted firmly in the present: in what was hers now only. She never fell asleep before a lover, as a rule. The Marquise had of course heard of the Vicomte de Valmont long before she met him, as well as his way with women. There came a point where he came up so often in conversation that his very name drove her to irritation. Then she caught herself and realized that the emotion she was experiencing was in fact jealousy. She knew that even if she were to have as many men as the Vicomte had reportedly had women, the world could never know-- and should it know, she would be scorned rather than praised. As it appeared the man was unlikely to go away, the Marquise determined to make him a notch on her bedpost for her own personal satisfaction. This was all, of course, before she met him. That was a night she never wanted to forget. He was handsome from afar, of course, she had guessed that much. But she was not really impressed until he met her eyes after kissing her hand. There was a spark behind those eyes that was like nothing she had ever seen before. The Marquise disguised her surprise quickly, and fell into the usual routine of inane chatter and subtle gestures. Valmont met her step for step, and she understood thatxa0 she had found herself an excellent sparring partner. However, it did not do to be too easily conquered, and so she bid him a perfectly respectable good night. Two days later she received an ardent letter from the Vicomte, and nearly burst out laughing. Men, she supposed, could afford to be so sloppy, but as she informed him a month later in bed, had she been who he assumed she was, the letter would have produced no effect whatsoever. At that, a lazy smile spread over Valmont's face. \"Ah,\" he replied, \"but you are assuming that I believed you were who you professed to be.\" Not a sparring partner, she realized, but an equal. That spark in his eyes had been the recognition of a kindred spirit. She found herself almost relaxed in his arms. It was an experience that was completely new to her, and she marveled at it. Valmont, she determined, was not quite so clever as she, but curious, yes. Full of life, oh yes, and boundless stores of creativity. \"I don't believe I shall ever meet another woman like you,\" Valmont murmured into her ear one night as they lay tangled together. In response she arched her head towards him. \"How many women have you told that to?\" He chuckled, and she felt the vibration in his chest. \"Not nearly enough.\" Somehow, it didn't matter. She should have been afraid when she woke in the morning and realized she had drifted off to sleep while he was running his fingers over her hip. She should have constructed an immediate plan to drive him away for her own safety. Intellectually she was aware of this, but the Marquise could only feel a peculiar serenity. To rest her hand on an indent in her sheets and know he had lain there-- sprawled really, he was hardly elegant once his feet left the ground-- it warmed her, somehow. Valmont, she realized, kept the night terrors away. He was everything she might have yearned for in a husband. She exerted complete control over him, and he was thus incompatible with a time when she had been powerless. The Marquise could not resist inviting him to her salon publicly. As pleasing as the Vicomte was in affairs private, she found talking with him an even rarer pleasure. He spoke to her as an equal, and promised to keep nothing from her if she would do the same. Of course, she did not think too hard about her own promise, knowing she would lie as soon as it became necessary. On the other hand, his candidness delighted her. His numbered lists of the charms of his other bed-partners were not nearly as amusing as his summaries of their faults. He even persuaded her to catalogue her own lovers similarly. Teasingly he asked her once for his own standings. \"As for faults, you flatter shamelessly and repetitively,\" she replied. \"I won't bore you with your better qualities.\" \"Don't you want to know yours?\" The Marquise raised her eyebrows. \"I'm afraid that would require you to break your oath of honesty.\" \"Not at all.\" Valmont smiled endearingly at her. \"You are my ideal woman.\" Her reaction must have conveyed disbelief, for he clasped both of her hands and pulled them to his chest. \"Really! I adore you, I worship you.\" She smiled, and glanced at the door. \"Shall we retire?\" \"I thought you'd never ask, darling.\" ","Summary":" For as long as she could remember, the Marquise had been lonely.

Set in the universe of the book, though can easily be read as backstory for the movie. \"The Vicomte de Valmont?\" She widens her eyes slightly, just enough so her shock appears genuine. Madame de Volanges shakes her head sadly, in the manner of one conveying news of a death in the family. \"I'm afraid so. The Countess says he's a friend of her husband, although rumor has it she's scandalously close to him herself. I know such a man must be an affront to your sensibilities, but you see he's all but certain to attend, and it wouldn't do to refuse her invitation on such short notice…\" \"I understand perfectly well.\" The Marquise smiles, though not for the reasons she knows her friend will imagine. \"Such men are woven into the fabric of our society, are they not? I do appreciate your warning, but I am not afraid. After the passing of my dear husband, men hold few temptations for me, and in all his vanity I find it hard to imagine Valmont would waste his time in pursuit of a grieving widow.\" \"You underestimate your charms, my dear!\" Madame de Volanges laughs. \"If my sources are to be believed, the man is absolutely shameless! Still, I hope you are right.\" \"So do I,\" she says, clasping the woman's hand in a gesture of utterly meaningless female solidarity. \"Oh, believe me, so do I.\" The Vicomte de Valmont is even more splendid in person than the Marquise imagined, cutting a swathe through the room with the practiced ease of a falcon, seeking out prey and not relinquishing it until he'd made certain of his kill. She does not approach him, does not even look at him for longer than seconds at a time, giving every appearance of aloof disdain. Still, she makes very certain that she is alone when he draws nearer. \"I don't believe we've been introduced.\" The Vicomte bows with a flourish, unnecessary but appreciated. \"I am the Vicomte de Valmont, and you, I am told, are the most virtuous Marquise de Merteuil.\" She tilts her head curiously. \"You've rather robbed me of an introduction, Vicomte, though you certainly don't require one. Your exploits are rapidly approaching legend.\" \"Are they? And here I thought a woman such as yourself would scorn to hear such unsavory things.\" His smile is blindingly charming, a thrilling surprise even from such a handsome face. Her mistake was deliberate, but she humors him by pretending to be taken aback for a moment before composing herself once more. \"Well, I am no recluse, and you are hardly discreet. I daresay my cousin, Madame de Volanges, waits breathlessly for tales of your latest conquest so she can rush to denounce you to all her friends.\" He laughs like a schoolboy, with an unrestrained glee that she might have found irresistible had she encountered him earlier in her studies. Which isn't to say she has any intention of resisting him now. Only that she won't be a little fool about it. \"Such compliments are gratifying, of course, but I must say I am significantly more interested in you, Madame la Marquise, than your cousin.\" She smiles, raising her fan. \"I must confess, Vicomte, I too, find you more interesting than my cousin.\" She leads him on carefully, a wolf to be guided through a hedge maze until he's lost all sense of orientation. She knows he is still sating his appetites with other women, not nearly as patient as he would like her to believe, but that is just as well, in her opinion. Let his old pleasures grow stale and charmless. Let him satisfy his physical urges while his pride remains thirsty for satisfaction, desire spurred on only by the littlest of gestures. \"There's an acquaintance of mine I've been meaning to ask after,\" she murmurs, selecting a bracelet of diamonds set in silver as she glances at the reflection of Valmont in her mirror. \"A woman.\" \"Oh?\" That smile would send shivers down a nun's spine. \"And here I thought you were too circumspect to befriend any woman I'm likely to know.\" \"I never said she was my friend.\" She pauses. \"The Intendante de -.\" Valmont's smile vanishes. \"And where did you hear that name?\" \"From the Comte de Gercourt, of course.\" She paused, letting the name sink in. \"When he told me he was forsaking my company for hers.\" His sharp eyes light with understanding, a hint of that smile playing around his mouth. \"So you're telling me I wouldn't be the first to cross your threshold?\" \"Far from it.\" She smiles in the mirror, taking up a heavy diamond necklace (counterpart to the bracelet) but before she can close the clasp Valmont's hands are on hers, brushing against the nape of her neck. \"Allow me, Madame la Marquise.\" His fingers are deft, and gone all too quickly. \"I must say, I was quite aware I was pursuing a woman of great intelligence and resourcefulness, but if you managed to ensnare Gercourt without any of his friends being the wiser for it, you are far more devious than I had dared dream.\" \"Unfortunately, he sprung free before I grew tired of him, much as I suspect the Intendant did in your case.\" She catches Valmont's eye in the mirror, just in time to see him frown. \"That has never happened to me before.\" \"That makes two of us.\" His words are sour, but the unguarded look on his face suggest he is far more interested in the fresh bait she is dangling before him than licking the wounds of the past. \"Which is why I thought it only appropriate than our paths should cross at long last.\" She tilts her head to observe the movement of her earrings and Valmont's grin, reflected just over her shoulder. \"You diabolical creature, you planned this from the start!\" He plants his hands on the back of her chair, leaning over her. \"How utterly magnificent you are.\" \"I propose something no other women can give you, Vicomte.\" Her heart began to pound. \"An alliance.\" \"An alliance?\" His breath was on her shoulder, hot even through the silken fabric. She turns, her powdered cheek brushing against Valmont's, and looks deep into the keen eyes of a fellow hunter. \"My mind for yours, in all its cunning. My honesty in exchange for yours. Tell me your secrets, and I'll tell you mine.\" He smiled with languorous pleasure.\"And your body?\" \"Oh, I think that can be arranged,\" she breathed, drawing him into a kiss. He is every bit as proficient as she imagined, and she is grateful indeed that he has no way of knowing the effect he is having upon her. For the time being she has the upper hand, and that is how she intends to keep it. \"You know, I'm rather inclined to feel grateful to Gercourt,\" Valmont remarks, his hand sliding up her thigh. Before she has time to be annoyed, he adds, \"If that colossal idiot hadn't given you up, I might have been denied these pleasures.\" \"And the Intendante?\" She imagines the woman lying feebly among her pillows, too pliant to notice any difference between her lovers. He laughs and she twists her hand in his hair till he lets out a grunt of pain. \"I was going to say, I've very nearly forgotten her name.\" She smiles, well pleased, and pushes his head down to her breasts.

Fingers clasped, back straight - she cannot afford a single moment of visible inattention, not when so many eyes are upon her, the Sisters and novices and young girls sneaking glances with their heads piously downcast. This is how it has been ever since she returned to the convent; hidden stares and open fascination and whispered conversations falling silent when she draws too near. It stings her, to be treated as a stranger in this place which once she knew as a home but she is not, whatever anyone else might think, so great a fool as not to understand what it is they whisper about. By now, the gossip has reached even Cécile in her solitude. She knows that the Vicomte is dead. And she knows, moreover, what secrets his death exposed to the world. They expect her to being doing penance; let them, she decided to herself when she returned to the convent, see what they expect. She comes to every mass, and remains kneeling in the chapel for long stretches of time when mass is done. Her gown is simple, almost dowdy, the fabric rough and scratching against her elbows and thighs. She takes supper each night in her room, and eats only scantily, only the plainest foods. She turns herself to a model of modesty, of maidenly repentance. Let all of them, in their curiosity, imagine how greatly she must regret her transgression. The truth is that Cécile does not know what it is she regrets. She turns the events of the past months over and over in her mind in search of some clear, shining moment in which she strayed away once and forever from the path of righteousness, but she cannot find one solid enough to turn within her hands and name as sin. For it was not sin to love Danceny, not innocently and truly as she did. It was not sin to listen to the guidance of the Marquise de Merteuil, who her own dear Mamma had instructed her to respect and honor, and who all the world named as the most proper of women. Perhaps it was sin to keep secrets from her Mamma, but not so great a sin as this, as the mortal one which she now was charged with. Was it a sin, then, not to fight? Not to scream? Was it a sin that she had not recognized, in the Marquise's calm injunction to return to the Vicomte's bedroom, the poisonous venom of malice? The first time she had come to confession after her arrival at the convent the priest sat before her in what seemed to be a state of tense anticipation, waiting for her to unfold to him some sordid tale of pride and lust. She had not known what to say. It was not a story yet, in her mind; it was only flashes of memory - the heat of Valmont's fingers, the wetness of her own blood, the metallic scent of the little, deadly key in her palm. If she thought too much about it she felt dizzy, she felt like she was slipping away from herself, losing the thread of the tale like a swift-flowing stream. And beneath it all she heard the Marquise's steady voice, smooth and constant, lulling Cécile into stillness as, when she was a girl, her nurse used to do by brushing out her hair with gentle strokes. And so she sat, for many long moments, before the priest until embarrassment finally came over her and she blurted out some nonsense which she could not afterwards recall and dashed away from the chapel. The Marquise dismissed the maid and closed the curtains and the room felt as though it would suffocate Cécile with its silence. \"Come now, my dear,\" the Marquise said, her voice smooth as cream, \"show me what Valmont has taught you.\" Cécile will always have difficulty thinking clearly about this afternoon, once it is over. When she tries to remember it, her head will pound and her vision will reel and she will feel herself unsteady on her feet. She will not have names for what transpired. She will not know how to recount it to anyone who was not present. She did not anticipate any of that then. Then, she blushed and looked down and played with the lace at the edges of her sleeves. \"What do you mean?\" The Vicomte laughed. He had spread himself out across the divan, the sharp heels of his shoes carefully averted from the embroidered upholstery. \"Don't be coy, Cécile - the Marquise knows all about our lessons. She simply wants to see how you have been getting on. We can't have all the time and effort she's devoted to her little protege coming to nothing, now, can we?\" He was beginning already to undo the gleaming buttons on his waistcoat. Cécile felt nausea build in her throat and thought it a childish reaction, one she was ashamed to feel before the Marquise's cool gaze. She could not do this. Before she could think more about it, Cécile left her chair and knelt at the Marquise's side, grasping her skirts, resting her forehead against them. \"Oh please, Madame, I know it is foolish of me, but I simply cannot - you know how grateful I am for all you have done for me, I beg you, do not think less of me on account of this, but I -\" Her words were stilled upon her tongue by the feel of the Marquise's fingers upon her hair, lightly caressing her. \"You know how much love I have for you, my dear, and yet you are blushing so! Do you truly think that I would ask anything of you that would bring you shame? My dear Cécile, if you truly wish to be ready for your Chevalier, then you shall need someone other than your teacher to observe your performance and correct your technique. Of course, if you would rather not…\" The fingers stroking Cécile's hair lightly closed, and the touch, so familiar and reassuring, was gone. Something like panic swelled in Cécile's sternum at the palpability of the Marquise's disapproval. She could not look at the Vicomte. She could not think about what it is she was expected to do with him. But she could not disappoint the Marquise's expectations in her either. \"I'm sorry, I - I will try.\" The Marquise leaned down and kissed Cécile's cheek. Cécile could smell her perfume, sweet and strong, and the powdery scent of her face paint. \"There's my good girl. You have nothing to be afraid of, darling - it's only me and Valmont. Just let me see what you've been working on.\" Cécile stood, and held the Marquise's words in her mind, and went to join the Vicomte de Valmont upon the divan. She kept wanting to write to the Marquise. It was a foolish, impossible wish, in the first place simply because she had no means of getting a letter out to her. She could hardly put it in with the other mail to be sent out from the convent, and she has no means now of paying someone to take it in secret, or even finding someone who might take on such a task. And besides, she has had enough of secret correspondence, of letters whose script was tangled up with desire and deception and cruelty. That time in her life was over. And Cécile did not now, when she stopped to think about it, what she would say to the Marquise, if she had the chance. She did not know if it would be possible to make the other woman understand how much her machinations had harmed her, for how could she enfold in a letter the betrayed tears on her Mamma's face, the contemptuous glances of the girls at the convent, the pain and terror of her miscarriage? And, if she could somehow manage to write a letter which could communicate any or all of that, what assurance could she have that the Marquise would care? Perhaps she would laugh. Perhaps she would smile lightly and shake her head and lay the letter aside. Perhaps she would write back. Cécile could imagine for herself what she might say, see the curling letters in her mind: Dearest Cécile, You can imagine how disappointed I was to receive your letter. To have thought so highly of a young person, and to have put so much time and care into developing her intellect and accomplishments, only to be rewarded with such grievous accusations of cruelty and harm! You must know, my dear, that all the advice I gave was intended only for your benefit and, though it saddens me to be so blunt to a child a hold so deal, any harm you came to was the result of your errors alone. I strove to provide you with all the opportunities and experiences which would enable your development into a fine young lady, fit to enter into the highest ranks of society. I saw you as one who would appreciate those opportunities, and put them to the best possible use; I appear to have been mistaken. I apologize, my dear, for my error in judgment, which seems to have exposed you to chances of a sophistication for which you were not yet prepared. No, she did not need to write to the Marquise. She had enough of her words in her mind already. Much later, when she had begun to settle back into life at the convent, Cécile heard about the Marquise's illness, and about her subsequent withdrawal from society. She had not known how to feel, and had needed to excuse herself from the large chamber in which she and many of the other women sat working together on embroidery for the altar cloth. Part of her felt a keen delight at the Marquise's misfortune, a sense that finally she had received a punishment fitting to her misdeeds. But another part of her could not help but doubt the thrill of her fury; she felt again the gentle fingers in her hair, heard the smooth steadiness of the voice which had calmed her through so many griefs and anxieties. How could she, how could anyone know who the Marquise was, or what she might deserve? And it was true that Cécile had, ultimately, learned much from her. Once her Mamma had first learned of all that had happened, she stormed through Cécile's room with the intention of taking and burning all her letters, from Danceny and Valmont and the Marquise herself. She tore the little writing desk apart searching for them, stripped the sheets from the bed and the little collection of prayer books and novels from the shelf. Cécile watched, keeping her face cool and impassive, feeling the letters crinkling against her thigh, bound to her garter with a length of green ribbon. In the convent she kept the letters safely tucked away in the spine of a prayer book, but the green ribbon remained tied lightly around her thigh, its smooth pressure reminding her to be patient and still and entirely opaque, to bide her time until the day she could find her way out this place and into a life that belonged only to her.

She is really delicious! She has neither character nor principles; judge how sweet and easy her society will be. I do not think she will ever shine by sentiment; but everything announces in her the liveliest sensations. Lacking wit and subtilty, she has, however, if one may so speak, a certain natural falseness which sometimes astonishes even me, and which will be all the more successful, in that her face presents the image of candor and ingenuousness. She is naturally very caressing, and I sometimes amuse myself thereby: her little head grows excited with incredible rapidity, and she is then all the more delightful, because she knows nothing, absolutely nothing, of all that she so greatly desires to know. She is seized with quite droll fits of impatience; she laughs, pouts, cries, and then begs me to teach her with a truly seductive good faith. Really, I am almost jealous of the man for whom that pleasure is reserved…\" There is something about the line that just flowed so effortlessly, mindlessly from my head through the nib of my pen onto the paper before me that gives me pause, though I am not accustomed to having to proofread my own correspondence. The Vicomte de Valmont has been so long my lover, so long my friend, so long my pawn, that I could truly, without the slightest shadow of a doubt, manipulate him in my sleep. Sometimes I even look forward to the days where I have a letter to write to him in return, reveling in the natural ease with which I write the letters, knowing I have nothing to worry about, knowing that I can't possibly slip up with a man I know as well as I do Valmont. And yet… I read back over the previous line and allow my lips to press themselves into a thin, disapproving line. \"Really, I am almost jealous of the man for whom that pleasure is reserved…\" the words roll around relentlessly in my brain, nagging at me not only with the truth that comes from deep within our subconscious when we keep the least watch on it, but also with the horrible sense that they do not belong in this letter, serving no real purpose. Mindlessly easy these letters may be to write, but that never meant that I filled them with useless drivel; each word has a purpose, a way of making Valmont more firmly mine. Lips going even thinner, if possible, I read back over the entire letter, keeping my face composed, though disapproving, until I reach that fateful paragraph and I feel the heat suffuse my features, thankfully hidden behind my makeup. As the heat spreads to my chest, which I know will show the scalding red that my face feels, but does not show, I attempt to get a hold of myself. My mind races as I try to figure out what to do, and when my blush stops spreading and growing in intensity I read again, this time attempting a different outlook on the words. There is a sexual undertone, no doubt about it, but the words evoke a captivating image that may just hook Valmont to the point where he overlooks the key phrase. I wonder, with a touch of desperation that is most unwelcome, how much he reads into my letters, for I am sure he knows I play word games with him. What are the chances that he will simply overlook the words that I find to be so delightfully scandalous? Good, I hope, as I am unwilling to rewrite the letter and sending the Vicomte a letter with words crossed out is unacceptable. I am unable to keep my eyes from scanning over the body of the letter again, taking in each elegant loop and deliberate stroke of my pen, trying to keep the new meaning I have attached to my words fixed in my head, trying not to let the true meaning shine through and instead see it with another's eyes. \"Really, I am almost jealous of the man for whom that pleasure is reserved…\" I end the sentence with a decisive period, and skip to the next line, to the next paragraph, determined to move on despite the unsettling way the letter doubles in my vision, one version truth, they other deception. Despite my determination to move from the topic, too sudden of a change would alert him to something, and perhaps cause him to re-read words which a woman with less daring than I would never send, and I cannot truly help but prattle on, bragging slightly, for another few sentences. This paragraph too, ends with a decisive period as I refuse to look back upon it or the one previous to it. \" It is at this moment that you would be very useful to me. You are sufficiently intimate with Danceny to obtain his confidence, and, if he once gave it to you, we should advance at full speed.\" I can almost make myself believe that those two sentences sum up the reason for the previous two paragraphs, and the dangerous truths that I hope to have hidden within my elegant script. I sign with my usual dismissive, airy phrasing, wishing that I could dismiss the contents of the letter as quickly as my words make it seem. \" Adieu, Vicomte; I am going to attend to my toilette, what time I will read your volume. Paris, 27 th August, 17-.\" 1 I seal the letter and hand it to my maid to be posted before I can think twice about it, before I can consider setting the missive alight and watching my secrets be swallowed in flames.

The Marquise, however, had not troubled herselfnover the work that had gone into them when she had bought the cards,nbut merely thought that they had been priced to high. Everythingnseemed to be priced too high in those days. The Marquise had forndecades been able to budget household expenses automatically, withnperfect certainty, but those days she found herself having to set farnmore money aside for such basic things as flour. Ofncourse, that was no reason to skimp upon the things that anyone wouldnnotice. She was wearing a new gown that day, with a farthingale innthe newest style and a skirt of heavy, pleated silk and, ornamentednwith many volants wherenthe manteau wasnsplit to show the underskirt beneath. Such things had cost her dear,nand her accounts were lower than she would like, by the necessity ofnkeeping up appearances was more important than petty expenses. Hernguests arrived when she expected them to, with Madame de Volangesnfirst (this time without little Cecile, rather unsurprisingly) Madamende Rosemonde after her (she still wore a coiffure at least thirty years out ofnstyle, which was perhaps more permissible than it would have been tonbe a mere few years behind the times), and, fashionably late asnalways, the Vicomte de Valmont. Madame de Volanges' face fellnnearly imperceptibly at the sight of him, though her habitual politensmile returned after only a few seconds. The Marquise rose from hernseat to curtsey, and as the Vicomte kissed her hand he gave her ansmile that bespoke such an intertwined web of respect, affection andndetestation that she found herself having to take an uncommonly largenbreath through the tight whalebone of her corset. She was irritatednwith herself for the far too obvious inhalation – she rathernpreferred to project the image to general acquaintances that shennever needed to breathe at all. Shenhad the servants move the card table as close to the fire as would benproper. \"It is such a cold winter, isn't it?\" she commented tonthe assembled group as she settled down, gathering her skirts aboutnher. This statement meant with general agreement, and in the extremennature of the weather Mesdames de Volanges and Rosemonde found angreat deal of material for discussion, though all involved werencareful not to mention the greater ramifications of the unusuallyncold winter. They all knew of the recent riots, but such thingsnsimply were not topics for polite conversation. ThenMarquise dealt the cards, speaking little so as to better observe.nBut, as she took her hand, Madame de Volanges addressed the Marquisendirectly, \"What do younthink of the situation in America?\" she asked, and for a moment thenMarquise was surprised enough at the unconventional choice of topicnthat she did not respond. The Vicomte, however, was quick to do so. \"Inthink it most delightfully novel,\" he said, \"to create a nationnwithout a king, in the manner of the ancient Greeks, is somethingnthat I think must require quite admirable courage. Not that I thinknit is all that likely to succeed, of course. If we remember, thenancient Greeks had their democracies within really very smallncity-states, and permitted only a relatively low percentage of thenpopulation to vote. I cannot imagine the same tactic working for sonlarge a nation.\" Madamende Volanges quite nearly glared at him. \"Well, I think it'snutterly horrifying. For a people rise up against their king likenthat! The very idea chills me. I know that it's King George theynoverthrew, but I rather don't think our King Louis ought to havenfunded such a revolution. It's treason, and it goes against thenlaws of nature, and I find it appalling that you could call thosenrebels courageous.\" ThenMarquise folded her pale hands on the table, her voice calm. \"Inthink it's a fine example of what happens when one tries to make annation of savages. It seems to me a clear message that we ought tonstop trying to colonize the Americas, as such things will onlyncontinue happening there.\" She paused, looking about at each of hernguests. \"Now, shall we continue with our game?\" Mayn1789 \"Shallnwe play cards?\" she asked him, looking quite directly at him. Henwas breathing heavily as though he had run there, though she couldn'tnimagine that such a thing was true. He rarely came to visit hernalone, though, those days, and so there had to be some pressingnreason. \"You'venheard of what happened?\" he asked, as though he had not heard her.nShe sighed, and tapped her fingers against the lacquered wood of thentable. \"Yes,nVicomte, I heard. The Third Estate went into hysterics, there wasnsome melodramatic scene in which they decided to form an assembly ofntheir own, or some rubbish like that, and then they locked themselvesninto a room to write a constitution. I do keep track of such things,neven though, being only a woman, I don't have the privilege ofnbeing a representative at such functions as you do. Now, do you wantnto play or not?\" \"Indon't think you quite understand the significance of this –\" henbegan, but the Marquise cut him off before he could finish. \"Inprobably know far better than you do. Yes, it was dramatic, itnwas…unheard of, but it's so entirely masculine of you to thinknthat anything is going to change after this. You see, my dearnVicomte, things do not change through loud scenes and impassionednpleas for justice. Any woman knows that even a few years intonmarriage. Things change slowly, subtly, after years of those on theninside making quiet suggestions, doing favors that shall be then owednto them, making their views common currency, Any change wrought by angroup of rabble locking themselves in a room and giving ultimatums isnsure to dissolve within a very brief span of time. Perhaps thesenThird Estate representatives will draft a constitution – it will bensure to be a terribly written thing, with no style at all, butnperhaps they will draft it. Perhaps the king will even sign it. Atnthe very most, perhaps those idiotic peoples' taxes will benlowered, if that is what they want. But then things will go back tonnormal. The king will have a few dissenters executed, prices on breadnwill go up a little more again, and we will continue to live ournlives. And you will be sorry that you spent your time worrying aboutnit.\" ThenVicomte fell into a chair, giving her a smile of concession. \"Younhave an…irresistibly logical way of putting things, Marquise.\" Shensmiled back, sitting down across from him and beginning to deal thencards. \"I do try.\" Henlooked at the hand he had been given and remarked, \"Madame denTourvel is worried about all those peasants. She spends an inordinatenamount of her time handing out bread to starving children.\" ThenMarquise raised her eyebrows. \"Dear.\" ThenVicomte nodded. \"She's nearly reduced herself to penury throughnher charitable impulses. I tell her that she can't possibly do anynreal good, but she doesn't listen to me in this matter, though shenlistens in most all others.\" ThenMarquise laid a card down. \"Charity is the refuge of the guilty andncomplacent. Your virtuous little lover can make herself feel asnthough she's doing some good in the universe while raising herselfnin the estimation of practically all those around her and only givingnup what she chooses to. I find the practice entirely detestable.\" Overnher card, the Vicomte laid a higher numbered one. \"I am attemptingnto cure her of it. Somehow, it's a longer lasting project than hernseduction was.\" \"It'sna waste of time,\" the Marquise said. She picked up a card and sawnthe elegantly detailed features of the Queen of Hearts. Withnpainfully learned skills, she did not let her joy show on her face. Julyn1789 ThenVicomte paced her floors so assiduously that the Marquise rathernfeared he would wear a hole in her rugs. She herself felt no need tondemonstrate her worry in so vulgarly obvious a fashion. She satnstill, willing her head to clear. She had dealt with much in her manynyears. Riots were not new, anger at the king was not new. But thentaking of a royal fortress, even one so infrequently used as thenBastille, by a full 80,000? Something in all that was just beyond thenbounds of belief. \"I'mnplanning to leave the city for a while,\" she said finally, wishingnthat the sound of her voice would still his pacing, \"once thisnchaos dies down enough that I feel I can leave without being accostednas a royalist upon stepping out my door. You should come too. I havena chateau, outside of the city, we can go there –\" \"Madamende Tourvel left,\" the words seemed to slip from the Vicomte'snmouth without any effort of will on his part, \"with her husband. They went to England. Shencried when she left me, but –\" \"Goddammit,nVicomte!\" the Marquise was surprised to hear herself shouting. Shenhadn't shouted in so many years that she had almost forgotten thenfeel of it. \"This isn't about your petty little love affair anynlonger, this concerns all of us. Now, if you would stop sulking likena schoolboy, perhaps we could actually plan –\" \"Anfew months ago, you were the one telling me that all of this wouldncome to nothing. I would like to see you acknowledge that lack ofnforesight on your part for once, admit that you are not infallible –\" \"Hownwas I to know?\" the Marquise picked up the deck of cards that satnon the table beside her and began shuffling them, pure habit drivingnher fingers to the action, \"This was an event that defied logic,nsomething that none of us could truly predict. And I hardly thinknthat it's really a time for you to gloat.\" Abruptly,nthe Vicomte stopped pacing and looked directly at her. \"Do you knownwhat I think, Marquise? I think that I won't leave Paris at all.nKing Louis is a fool, we all knew that. I think I won't try to runnaway from this new government with the rest of you. I don't want tonact as if I've done anything wrong. Perhaps the Third Estate'snconstitution will make things better for all of us, rid us of thesenidiotic restrictions –\" \"Younthink that they'll want you as part of their government?\" she hadnto interrupt, for his self-centered failure in logic was so painfullynevident. Hencontinued, only raising his voice to acknowledge the fact that shenhad spoken \" – start raising children who aren't completelynignorant of the very desires of their bodies –\" \"Theynwon't let you keep your silk waistcoats and your powdered queue innyour glorious Greek republic, Vicomte! You won't have the leisurento seduce adolescent girls and virtuous wives any longer! You'llnhave to work there, work like all the world but us has, break thenskin of your soft hands, know what it is to be hungry! We couldn'tnstand that, Vicomte, none of us could! Know that, and leave when Indo! We'll go to England, or…Austria, or anywhere. We'll survive, andnyou'll forget Madame de Tourvel in time. You know as well as I thatnyou will.\" Shenforced her hands to put down the cards, breathed till she could feelnthe warmth of emotion in her cheeks dying down. The Vicomte wasnlooking at her, and she realized how little even he had seen of hernbeing afraid. For a moment, she imagined leaving Paris while henstayed. The carefully constructed images of herself that she hadnworked so hardly to keep from mingling – the virtuous widow whonMadame de Volanges could trust with her daughter, the exalted Venusnwho men like Belleroche and Danceny could worship, and the witty,nbitter libertine who could exchange ripostes and reminisces with thenVicomte de Valmont – would all fall to pieces. It was curiouslyndisconcerting, the idea of a life without him as a sparring partner. Henmust have been thinking the same thing, for he sat down beside her onnthe divan, and for, the first time in years, kissed her. \"Staynhere, Marquise,\" he asked, \"don't return to that old world ofnhypocrisy and marital contracts.\" Andnthough she knew his tactics nearly as well as her own, although shenknew that his combination of cynicism and idealism would be fatalnsomeday, although she knew all that – somehow, she decided then tonstay in Paris. Septembern1789 Hernhouse was constructed like a labyrinth, and she was glad of thatnthen, as she locked herself in one of the deepest rooms and waited.nShe couldn't hear anything that went on except in a few of thenclosest rooms, and so everything felt curiously quiet to her. It wasna feeling at once both frightening and calm. Thenraids on the houses of aristocrats – many of them empty by thatnpoint – had been increasing in frequency of late, and that evening,nas she heard the cries of mobs near her window, she had rushed tonthis room, and locked the door, bracing a large wardrobe against itnfor further protection. There was no one else there to notify, as allnher servants were long gone, for one reason or another. It had beennless difficult than she had expected, having no more servants. Shenhad always made a point of knowing how to dress and undress herselfnwithout a maid, and she ate so little in those days that it wasnscarcely a trial not to have cooked meals. Butnthere she was, in any case, waiting – for what, she could not bencertain. Her hands needing something to do, she picked up a deck ofncards that lay near her, and began shuffling. After a brief moment ofnconsideration, she began to lay them out in the pattern of a patiencengame. She did not play patience games very frequently, as, to her,ncard games were chiefly interesting for the social aspect of them,nbut there were useful on occasion, and, at that point, she was gladnshe knew them. Somentime passed – without a clock, she could not be certainly how long.nShe could hear voices, some distance away. They sounded drunk, but nonmore dangerous than all the wild drunkards she had known throughoutnher life. The thought was vaguely amusing – a mob that could killnher being a group of foolish, laughable drunkards. She smiled tonherself slightly, tracing the gold inlay on the backs of the cards asnshe did so. Therenwas the harsh sound of something breaking. She winced. Her house wasnlike a fragile, carefully constructed work of art, and thendestruction of any one piece would reduce the effect of the wholenpiece. She did suppose that she would have rather more pressingnconcerns after that night was over, but she could not help but benbothered by the thought of the broken object, whatever it was. Shenbegan to hypothesize which of her things it could be, but it was andaunting task, and soon there was another crash, far closer, and itnmade her calculation seem preposterous. Hernthoughts turned to her husband, as she reshuffled her cards and begannto lay them out for another game. He had once broken a porcelainnfigurine of which she had been very fond. He had thrown it in herndirection, rather near her head. She remembered staying very still asnit fell, trying not to wince at the sound. When he had left the roomnshe had gone to clean it up. She was still young enough then that shentried to keep things from her servants. Thensound of glass shattering brought her back to the present. What werenthey all doing out there? They must be taking things; surely theynwere taking things. She wished they would get on with it, if theynmust do it in the first place. If they got on with it, then perhapsnthey would not be thorough enough to go the effort of breaking downnto the door the room in which she was currently located. Timenpassed. Much of it, though she had no idea how much. The voices grewnlouder, than slowly softer again until she could not hear them atnall. For what she suspected were hours, she closed her eyes and triednto remember pieces by Mozart. It was not particularly affective. Eventually,nshe decided it was worth the danger of leaving the room. She gatherednup her cards and, clutching them closely, she ventured into thenuncertain territory of the rest of her house. Shenalmost wished that she had not left, for the fragile beauty of hernhouse was not merely disturbed, but entirely destroyed. The windowsnwere broken, everything of possible value was stripped away, andnassorted, worthless objects were flung about the floors. Somehow, itnall still seemed unreal to her, though she could feel the chill fromnthe broken windows creeping up her bare hands into her pale, thinnwrists. Out of habit, she stopped to look at her reflection in anbroken mirror. She did not recognize herself in it, and somehow, thatnwas the worst thing, for, throughout all her life, whatever happened,nshe had always been very certain of herself. Then,nbecause there was nothing else for her to do, she sat down and begannagain to lay out her cards. Julyn1793 Itnhad to it the sensation of looking in a mirror. Their eyes searchednone another for a few moments, as critically as they had alwaysnexamined their own reflections in the mornings, before going out tonface the world. The hair was lank, tangled, uncared for innpreparation for the swift cut that would surely occur before thenswifter cut of the guillotine. The clothes were simple and dirty, thenprisoners' reality of the disguises that they both had donned sonoften in play. The faces seemed almost unreal without powder andnpaint. Faint bruises on the cheekbones, opposite for each of them,njust like a true mirror. Eventually,nthey were satisfied with what they had seen of each other, and couldnspeak. She did so first, tilting her head questioningly. The gesturenseemed a mocking imitation of all the times she had done it in yearsnpast. \"How did you come to be here, my dear Vicomte?\" Shencould see him shifting his shoulder, attempting to lift back on somenforgotten mantle of aristocracy and disaffected wit. \"Not Vicomtenany longer. I did join the new government, in an utterlynuninteresting administrative capacity. I'm Citizen Valmont now,nofficially.\" Surprisendid not even register upon her face. \"In which case I repeat mynquestion. Why, then, are you here?\" Henturned away from her, his hands instinctively going to play with lacencuffs that no longer existed. At that physical realization, his handsndropped to his sides, as though he did not know what to do with them.n\"You were right as always, Marquise. Work did not agree with me.\"nThe words were spat out, staccato. \"I complained. Criticized.nThreatened my superiors, in fact. Exploited all those luxuries thatnwe aristocrats grew used to but which are denied to us in a free andnequal government like this one. No one did anything about me, though,nuntil one of Monsieur Robespierre's informants heard me decry thenuse of the revolution in a moment of anger. Thus, here. And thenconqueror of so many goes to his final bed in the arms of thenbeauteous – and equally promiscuous in those she embraces –nMadame Guillotine.\" Shensmiled. It was a simple smile, without malice, though she did notnknow if he could tell that. He looked at her, asking, \"What aboutnyou?\" Shenlifted her hands to him, showing, within them, her glorious deck ofnplaying cards, with the inlaid gold and carefully detailed portraits.n\"Someone thought they showed evidence of royalist sympathies. Thenkings and queens are too beautiful.\" Hisnexpression changed, and she did not know if he believed her. \"Ofncourse,\" he said, \"of course you would be caught for somethingnlike that.\" She was silent, holding the cards tight within herndirty hands. \"I admit to having no idea how you became aware of mynpresence here, however.\" Againnshe smiled, but it was an old smile, a smile from the years beforeneven he knew her, one full to the point of spilling over withnbitterness. \"An old friend of ours works here in the prison. ThenChevalier Danceny.\" ThenVicomte's eyebrows lifted. \"The music lessons weren't bringingnin much profit, I see. And I suppose that also explains how younobtained permission to spend this time with me?\" Shenclosed her eyes, hating the weakness of it but not letting herselfncare. \"Don't be vulgar, Vicomte.\" Shencould hear his familiar, slightly obnoxious laughter. \"I wasn't.nI would never think you brought so low, even by this, as to barternyour affections – or your body, if we indeed must be vulgar – fornfavors, but –\" Shenopened her eyes and looked directly at his. \"We don't joke aboutnthings that are true any longer. There are enough crowds laughing atneach head that gets chopped off.\" Shencould see emotion in his face – real, genuine, unfeigned emotion.n\"I didn't think that it actually could be true, when I said thatn–\" \"Whatndid you expect?\" She only realized after saying it how angry shensounded. \"I know how to use my own…beauty, Vicomte. I know thenextent and the limit of it. And I do know how to seduce. Such talentsnmay here have far less of the safe, elegant trappings that we arenused to, but I would be a fool if I did not use them now for my ownnsake.\" A pause. \"I'm getting out of here tomorrow.\" Henwas still in seriousness. \"Danceny again?\" Shennodded. \"I won't get any favors after that. I'll have to makenmy way in the world.\" Hensmiled, though only slightly. \"I am quite certain that you'llnsurvive.\" Shensmiled back. \"I do hope so.\" Henswallowed with some sudden though, and she could see the movement ofnit in his throat. \"Tomorrow, I'm going to the guillotine.\" Slowly,nsteadily, she took in the news. It was an irrevocable fact, and shenknew that there was no way she could ignore it. \"I'll be there.nI'll watch.\" \"I'dnlike that,\" he said, and such were things between them that shenknew it to be true. Afterna moment, she drew close to him, putting a hand gently on the side ofnhis neck. There was something very human about him there, in thenprison, something that she had never been able to see beforenunderneath his neckties and lace cuffs and powdered wigs. She hadnalways known, with the certainty born from her careful study, fromnchildhood, of all those within her sight (she had observed them likeninsects under glass, until they pulled her in and did not let hernremain detached any longer), that such humanity was in him, but shenhad never before seen it. And so she asked, soft, \"Shall we playnanother game?\" Februaryn1800 Thencards were beautiful. They were a bit battered with age and travel,nbut that very fact made them antique, a precious relic of the nationnbefore the revolution. Everything that had been so beautiful aboutnthem then remained, but was increased in significance tenfold by thennostalgia of those who looked at them. The nation, of course, wasnstill a republic, and no one said within anyone else's hearing thatnit would have been better if Louis XVI had remained king, but it hadnbeen eleven difficult years since the revolution, and many liked tonlook back on those days and remember them as better than they were. She,nlike the cards, was a relic of the days before the revolution. Shenknew that, knew very well that when any of her new acquaintancesnvisited her, it was to see that in her. For that reason, she dressednstill in the styles of eleven years before, and spoke with thenpeculiar combination of intimacy and formality which characterizednsociety of those days. True, she now lived in a small assemblage ofnrooms in a building with peeling paint upon the outside. True, hernclothes, though in the same styles she had once worn, were made ofnfar less expensive materials. But she had popularity, of a specificnsort. She was mysterious, alluring – the enigmatic Marquise denMerteuil, aristocrat who had lived through the revolution. No doubt,nall though, she must have seen a great many of her friends die, nondoubt she must have been forced to see the error of her decadent,nexcessive ways. There were men and women of marriageable age who hadnbeen only children when the revolution began and who now looked uponnher with wonder and admiration. Andnso she had no shortage of invitations to dinner parties, or guests toninvite to her own. And, though there were many things she would havenchanged about her life if she could have, she took her role andnplayed it with grace and dignity. Shenbegan arranging the furniture, moving the card table as close to thenfire as she could. It was a cold winter, and she had important guestsnsoon. Monsieur and Madame Bonaparte themselves were coming to playncards. Napoleon Bonaparte had only recently become first consul ofnFrance after a string of glorious military victories, and anyone whonhe took a liking to could expect a fortuitous future. Therenwas a knock upon the door.

She danced, then, though she had rarelyndanced even with her husband, and she let the clicking sounds ofnValmont's heels against the lacquered floor guide her. The musicnwas wild, not the courtly minuets to which she was accustomed, andnquickly she grew out breath, the stays of her tightly laced corsetnholding her diaphragm into stillness and forcing her to breathe inngasps that made the low cut bodice of her gown (Valmont had given itnto her, and she could not dare to imagine that other women had wornnit before her) seem even more immodest. She pictured herself faintingnonto the ground and hated the image. \"You need something to drink,\"nValmont said upon seeing her so flushed, and he drew her blissfullynaway from the dance floor, where a perfectly dressed servant offerednthem white wine. Marianne took a glass, which glimmered in perfectlyncut crystal. She thought Valmontnmight sit beside her then, but he did not, for a woman with palencurls dangling over her ears and a gown of deep blue came to him tonbring him back to the dance. With a whisper of apology in Marianne'snear, he was gone. She wandered then,nawkwardly, around the perimeter of the room, holding her glass ofnwine and wishing that the rituals of the world she was used to wouldnhelp her in this frantic place to which Valmont had brought her. Most of the inhabitantsnof the room were still dancing, but Marianne came upon a woman merelynsitting, with an impassive, indecipherable expression upon her face.nHer cream colored skirts were spread out around her like the domainnof an empress. Marianne felt certain that she had met her before, butncould not imagine where. The woman looked up atnher. For an instant, Marianne thought she saw a twist of recognitionncross her face, but it was quickly gone, if it had ever existed,nleaving the woman's face again perfectly smooth. \"Madame denTourvel?\" she asked. Her voice was cultured, pleasant. \"I'm notnsure if we've been introduced. I'm the Marquise de Merteuil.\" Marianne felt for hernskirts and curtsied. The Marquise smiled. \"Inam a friend of Valmont's.\" Marianne straightenednher back and looked into the woman's eyes half defiantly. She hadnheard the Marquise de Merteuil spoken of as a conscientious,nhonorable woman, but Marianne could not help but distrust all ofnValmont's acquaintances. She believed that he had put aside thenvices of his old days, yes, she trusted him in that assurance, butnall those women of which he had spoken – The Marquise stood, andnMarianne saw the glimmer of diamonds, or crystal, in her elaboratenwig, at her neck, woven into the bodice of her gown. Subtle, sonsubtle, that only the sudden movement made them visible, but theirnbrief glitter was garish. \"He has told me a great deal about you,\"nthe Marquise said quietly, her smile still so polite, so reassuring. Marianne's palmsnbegan to itch. She wanted to find Valmont and leave that place, gonhome to the cool quiet of her sheets where Valmont would kiss hernskin and tell her that he loved her till she had no doubts. \"He'snnever mentioned you to me.\" The Marquise tooknMarianne by the arm, so swiftly that Marianne could hardly see thenmovement. \"Then we have much to talk about. Would you mind if wendiscussed our mutual acquaintance somewhere more private?\" Marianne imaginednValmont finishing his dance and not being able to find her, feelingnfurious and betrayed. She did not wish to talk to this strange,ncollected woman of him, and while she had disliked the noise andnmovement of the party, being in some silent room alone with thenMarquise seemed a far less preferable possibility. But she went,nbecause she could not refuse without making a scene of it, and thatnshe would not do. She did not know hownthe Marquise knew the building so well, but Marianne wasnunhesitatingly led down papered corridors to a small chamber thatnmust have been a dressing room of some sort. There was a mirror onnone wall, and a divan in one corner. Hairbrushes and face paints laynscattered upon a small table with spindly legs. The Marquise closednthe door behind them. \"I wanted to warn younabout the Vicomte de Valmont.\" The Marquise's voice was asnpleasant as before. Marianne felt the sudden, uncharacteristic desirento hit the woman across her perfectly powdered face. But she kept her voicencalm. \"Thank you for your kind intentions, but I believe I havenheard that before,\" she said, moving towards the door. The Marquise caughtnMarianne's wrist, and Marianne was so shocked that she didn'tnpull away. \"You're throwing your life away, Madame de Tourvel, Indo hope you realize that.\" \"I've never met younbefore, and I hardly think you're in a position to judge –\" The Marquise pullednMarianne in front of the mirror on the wall and, with her hands firmnupon Marianne's shoulders, held her there. \"Look at yourself.\" Marianne looked, andnthough she knew what she would see, still she winced at the brightnred of her lips, the rouge on her cheeks, the snake-green of herndress. Then, the Marquise whispered, \"He's making you into anwhore.\" Marianne flinched. As though encouraged bynthat reaction, the Marquise continued speaking. \"Once, you werentalked of as the most chaste and virtuous wife in all of Paris. Thesendays…have you heard the whispers? In the eyes of the world, you'rensimply another of the many conquests of the Vicomte de Valmont, morenproof that even the best can be corrupted. I do not believe that suchna reputation is what you want.\" Suddenly finding thennecessary strength in herself, Marianne pulled away from thenMarquise's grip and looked the other woman full in the face.n\"You're jealous,\" she told the Marquise, and was surprised atnhow calm her own voice was, \"he cared for you once, but now thatnhe's found love with me, real love, not the bejeweled lies you fednhim, he has no need for you anymore. And so you want to get me out ofnthe way. That's what this is about, isn't it?\" For a moment, Mariannencouldn't tell what the Marquise was going to do. Then she threw hernhead back and laughed, a bright laugh as hard as glass. \"My dear,\"nshe said in a voice slow with languid amusement, \"what makes younthink that you have anything to offer him that I do not?\" Marianne felt a certainntriumph with the confirmation of her supposition. \"Obviouslynthere's something.\" She was surprised at the hardness in her ownnvoice. \"Well, there's thennovelty, of course, for now,\" the Marquise said, taking a stepntowards Marianne, \"men are like children – I'm sure you mustnhave grown to realize that at some point in your life. If they don'tnhave a new toy, they get bored.\" Marianne's handsnbegan, quite of their own accord, curling into fists. \"I don'tnbelieve that.\" \"And he says that,nonce you finally and tearfully capitulated, you were unexpectedlynsplendid at the act of love itself, which no doubt would allow you tonhold his attention longer than you might if –\" Marianne felt hernbreath catch in her throat. \"He told you?\" The Marquise smiled.n\"We had a bet upon it, in fact. He wrote me an exquisite thoughnsomewhat self-aggrandizing letter at the occasion of his triumph, anletter, which, incidentally, I imagine that you might not wantngenerally, circulated. \"I don't believenyou.\" \"Perhaps you'llnfeel differently once all of society has read Valmont's account ofnyour seduction.\" She would not benafraid, not even of this woman with her hidden motives andnunwarranted social standing. Marianne gathered together the tendrilsnof her love for Valmont, buried deep within her skin like thorns, andnfelt the weight of that emotion in her chest, grounding her againstnthe Marquise's lies and threats. \"What do you want?\" \"You are makingnValmont weak, with your oaths of fidelity and declarations of love. Inwant you to break things off with him, using your virtue, your lovenfor your husband, and your fear for your reputation as pretense. Inwant you to show him that you are, in fact, nothing more thannprudish, philanthropic wife you appear to be. Then, I shall keep whatnI know to myself.\" As the Marquise waitednfor an answer, secure in her own power, Marianne found a calm innherself, deep beneath the instinctive panic which the Marquise'snthreats first instilled. Yes, this woman was as impassive andncollected and glittering as cut crystal. But, in that strength, therenwas a brittleness. And, one day, someone would shatter the Marquisenjust as Valmont had shattered Marianne, but perhaps without the samenintentions afterwards. Marianne had no reasonnto fear her. \"No,\" she saidnsoftly, and went back to join Valmont.

Thenthought of seeing Kate again, at all, was just so… \"We'llnget a drink of something, okay?\" Kate smiled on her end, taking thenwrapped towel off of her head and reaching for her hairdryer behindnher on the desk. \"Sure.nOf course, I'll get a soda,\" Adam quipped. Kate giggled, wringingnher hair out a little more. \"What'renyou going to be doing, then, since you're not coming with me to bentortured by boring art?\" she asked coyly. She reached behind hernagain. \"Hunting.\" \"Huh?nSorry, what?\" Kate had turned on the dryer accidentally as Adamnspoke so she didn't catch his words. She pushed it away, her hairnflying into her mouth and in her eyes, turning it off. \"S-sorry!\"nshe apologised. \"I turned on the hairdryer.\" \"Innoticed,\" Adam laughed, hoping she didn't read into the edge tonit. What had he just said…?! \"So. Younwere saying?\" she prompted him. \"I said,num, I'd be walking. I was gonna go for…a walk in the park andntake some photos. For the Spring Fair, you know?\" ' I'mnsorry, Kate. I'm lying to you…' \"Oh, Insee. Yeah, Pete asked you to do that column too, huh?\" ' I'mnso sorry.' \"Yeah…\" What an idiot he was. Thank God she'd turned on the hairdryer whennshe did or he'd never have been able to explain it. \"Oh,nshoot! I'm getting late,\" Kate said worriedly. \"Okay,ngo get ready.\" \"I'llntell you all about it, okay? Bye!\" \"See younlater,\" he said quietly and cut the call. Adamnstroked the tip of one of the arrows, wincing as he cut his finger.nHe watched the blood drip from it and smiled darkly. He'd be goingnto the exhibition alright, but to see Lily not the art… ~Fin~[Chapter 3] \"Youndidn't really miss much,\" Kate assured her sort-of boyfriendnfingering the beading of her bracelet as she leant her elbows on thenedge of the bar. \"Justnsome really bad art, and Dorothy's boyfriend getting harassed bynsome crazy woman.\" Adamnsmiled, rubbing her shoulders soothingly. Kate returned his smilenwith a tired one of her own. It had been a trying day. She wasnglad to have met up with him; just being near Adam made her feelnbetter. \"Inalmost wish I came now,\" he was saying. \"I could have made itnmore enjoyable for you.\" Katensnorted. \" You would have ignored the art, dragged me into ancorner and made out the whole night!\" Hengrinned, leaning forward to kiss her forehead softly. \"Somethingnwrong with that?\" he asked, his lips at her ear. Kate shivered andnmoved away nervously. \"Adam,\"nshe protested weakly. He moved back straight away, a small smile onnhis face. \"Relax,nKate. I know,\" he said quietly, looking down at the empty glass innhis hand. \"I'll behave.\" \"You cannnever behave,\" Kate laughed, trying to lighten the mood. Shencouldn't stand it when he looked so...lost, and alone like that.nThis was hard enough for her without him looking like that .nShe tried to smile up at him, her blue eyes warm yet slightly sad. Henknew why she hesitated, why it hurt her, and cursed himself insidenover and over. Why was he like this? Why did he always end up this way…? LosingnKate had been the worst thing to ever happen to him. Almost as badnas… \"Kate,nI…\" He shook his head to clear the bad memories from his mind andnswallowed, trying to find the right words. He had to tell her hownmuch she meant to him, how much he needed her… \"I'mnsorry…for everything. I…I just…\" \"It'snokay,\" Kate's response, warm, kind but still automatic made hisnheart sink right down to his knees. She understood, of course, shenalways had. But that didn't mean that she was ready to take himnback… \"You…younlike a drink. I understand that, Adam, but…\" She looked up atnhim, her smile fading. \"Sometimes you get out of control. And itnscares me.\" \"I won'tnhurt you,\" he vowed determinedly. \"I've changed, Kate. Believenme. \" He didn'tnwant to hurt her ever again. He didn't want to ever make her scarednagain. All he wanted was a chance to prove that to her. \"All I'mnasking for is a chance,\" he pleaded gently. He almostnadded, \"you almost did before,\" but that would have been crazy.nShe could never know. She could never know that he was thenone… He wasnsuch a hypocrite , he thought, as he watched her indecision andnfear crossing her face. He would have to hurt her a littlenmore yet. Those bitches still had to pay their share… ~Fin~[Chapter 4] \"I havento go,\" Kate pulled reluctantly away from Adam's arms as shenreached for her coat. \"Got tongo to Dorothy's. The detective called us all up to meet him there.\" Hernsort-of boyfriend frowned but let her go, kissing her cheek softly. \"Havenfun,\" he muttered sarcastically. Kat frowned as she put her coatnon, pulling her ponytail out from under the collar as Adam watchednher. Not again . \"Adam…\" Why did henalways have a problem with her friends? Whenever she said she wasnmeeting up with one of the girls Adam would turn all surly and clingynlike a child. Why didn't he like them…? Actually,nshe thought as she hugged him briefly, it was more Dorothy thannthe rest. Adam always seemed to dislike it the most when she met upnwith Dorothy, and Kate got the impression that he didn't like hernat all. But…that was ridiculous…they hardly knew each other… \"I justndon't see why you have to do this,\" Adam grumbled by waynof explanation for his surliness as she hugged him. \"I mean, younguys hadn't seen or head from Shelley in about a year. What doesnthat detective think you can help him?\" He'dnhave to deal with him if he started meddling too much, he decided,nscowling darkly. It was just getting interesting now… \"We werenher friends ,\" protested Kate defensively, shaking her head.n\"Vaughn thinks that we may be able to help him out, so, like it ornnot, Adam I'm going over there.\" \"Well,ngood luck to him.\" Adam turned his back on Kate abruptly, a smallnsmile on his face. \"He's wasting his time.\" \"Why?\"nKate asked, frowning in confusion. \"Why do you say that?\" ' Crap.' \"Well, Inmean...\" Adam struggled to explain himself. \"Do you guys knownanyone who had it in for Shelley? Sounds to me like he's suspiciousnof you.\" \"That…can'tnbe right…\" Kate walked around to face him, comprehension dawningnin her eyes. \"Oh God, do you really think so?\" Adamnshrugged indifferently. \"It's possible. These detectives willnthink of anything to get a lead.\" ' Whichnis why I'll have to deal with him soon…' Kate tooknhis hand and he squeezed it, looking down at her face. She lookednscared… really scared. It killed him to see that fear in herneyes. \"Kate,nit's okay.\" He hugged her tightly. \"You're going to be okay.\" Shennodded, but he could see she was still unconvinced. ' You will be okay,' he vowed as he watched her go out. 'Because I'm going to fix all this. It's not y ou I want to kill…'[Chapter 5] God, henneeded a drink! That bitch had been the hardest to track down.nPouring a glass, smirking to himself, Adam remembered how she'dnscreamed as the lid closed on her and then her vain attempts tonstruggle for air through the holes he drilled. \" I'dnrather be boiled alive!\" \"Well,nPaige,\" he toasted himself, and put back another shot in one gulp.n\"Guess you got your wish.\" He feltngreat. This killing business was getting easier with time. It wasnstill messy, but fun. He shrugged off the image of the screamingnwoman as he'd impaled her neck through the glass of the showernstall. She had no business being there in the first place. Her ownnfault. \"Stupidnbitch,\" he chuckled. \"Adam!\" Kate? Oh,nwhoops, that was weird. The bottle next to his glass was now empty.nHe felt…so strange…like he were falling headfirst towards thenfloor… He straightened up and saw her staring at him.

Without waitingnfor a reply, she whirled around and pushed past Dorothy who wasngaping in the doorway. Adam stumbled after her, panic rising in hisnthroat. \"Kate,nhey-! Wait, come on, don't be mad!\" He pulled at her arm,ndragging her back to face him. \"It's Valentine's Day!\" \"Getnaway from me!\" Kate cried, tears pouring down her cheeks as shenpulled away from him again and ran. Adam feltnthe bile rise in his mouth. He wanted to follow her, but his legsnwouldn't move. He wanted to scream, to yell and break things.

Tout regorgeait de dorure, de tenture… C'est tellement luxueux que ça en devient insolent, pensa amusé le vicomte de Valmont. -Ma chère votre simplicité vous honore. Encore un peu et votre modestie vous ruinera » La marquise ferma son éventail d'un coup sec. « -Vicomte…Ne me faîtes pas rire, mon corset est trop serré. Et avant que vous ne le demandiez, non, vous ne pouvez pas m'aider à le desserrer… -Vous me peinez beaucoup, moi qui avait tant envie de vous soulager de cette encombrante robe.

David is drool worthy. pIt was almost midnight and the only light came from the moonlight shining through the windows of the empty hall. He had remembered where the Gym was. Why wouldn't he? He hated it. Hated it with, with a passion. Yeah. That was the right word 'passion'. He thought to himself silently as he crept into the squeaky-floored Gym. He had so easily shut down the security system, they'd never see him. Funny. Wasn't that the problem in the first place? /p pHe sifted through the closet in the boy's locker room. He knew it would be there. Like some sort of sick trophy. Oh, but he would make them pay. He would definitely do that. But what about Kate? She said she would dance with him, she didn't mock or jeer at him. He would have to think about that later, but first the mask. It was slightly bent, but workable. He put it on and checked the mirror, seeing if he could be recognized. Not one bit. Then again, they wouldn't recognize him without it./p p His revenge would be perfect. It would be delivered in time. He had been thinking it for years, making every step an exact. Nothing could go wrong. Nothing will. His revenge will be very slow, taking them one by one and in the end they would know it was him. They had to. Or else the revenge will not have been found./p He walked out of the Gym, mask swung by the string over his shoulder./p p\"This will be perfect,\" he said to himself throwing the mask in the car and hoping in,\"just perfect.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Party p The mansion was absolutely packed. It always was whenever Dorothy Wheeler has a party. Especially this party. For this was her Valentine's Day Party. Why wouldn't come? Gathered around her were her closest friends: Paige Prescott, Lily Voight, and Kate Davies. The only one missing from the group would be Shelly Fisher, but she was always busy. Shelly was currently striving for her Doctor's Degree./p p Kate seemed to be the only one un interested in the party. She never paid much interest into Valentine's Day. Even in middle school she waited at the bleachers or by the bowl. Plus it always reminded her about what her friends did to that poor boy so long ago. She sighed and took a seat in the lunge, wanting away from all the fun./p p He looked them over carefully, finding the group very easily. They were all right there. Weren't they? Someone was missing. Never the less he had found them. He made sure to memorize their faces carefully. He'd make sure to compare them with the face they will have when they die. He smiled to himself at that thought. The thought that they would finally pay. But how should he begin? He had thought of many opportunities, but finally resided on getting on the inside. He noticed Kate wasn't with the group. Beautiful Kate, he had always loved her. He always will./p p His plan was simple, he'd have a cover up. He would claim to have a drinking problem while they were dating, no one would ever give it a second thought. And as for his name, well he'd have to change that. J.M. anything would give it off. Adam. He decided. After all, Eve was evil, she got them expelled from peace! That's the way it was!/p p Dorothy squinted her eyes looking at the man who just walked in. Was he familiar or what? But where had she seen him? She couldn't quite put her foot on it. Maybe some one she had met at one of her Father's parties. Oh well, he was certainly cute...maybe if she could just make her mov- Hey!/p p Paige had gotten there first. Slut! How could she? Paige was always the sexy one. Someday she would get some revenge. Too bad it's not now./p p\"Hi there,\" she smiled one of her infamous smiles./p p\"Hey,\" he grinned,\"I'm looking for a Kate Davies?\"/p Hah! Dorothy thought, that should put Paige in her place! But then again, that means she wouldn't have a shot either. She sighed and stepped forward./p p\"Check the lounge.\"[Chapter 3] The Lounge p Kate glanced about the lounge after hearing a noise. Was someone there? Couldn't be. She hadn't seen anything move throughout the room. But it was there. That eerie feeling of bieng watched. She walks around the room for a spell then checked by the door. Nothing. She returned back to the sofa, but to see a small red envelope. She looked at it oddly before turning it to face up. 'Kate' it read in simple black letters. She carefully opened it and read:/p p What is in a name, that if you shall call a rose by anything else it will smell as sweet as you Kate. J.M. /p p She paused. J.M. She didn't knwo any J.M.'s. Well, he obviously knew her . She looked it over again. 'What is in a name,' an intresting poem to write as a valentine. She heard footsteps aproaching and quickly hid the love letter. She sat down and glanced up to see a black figure. /p p\"Um, may I help you?\" she asked trying to be polite in the obviously wierd situation./p p There was no answere. The figure just kept coming closer and closer, until she saw a glimmer from its arm-length. A knife. No. Too big. A sword. That was the right word: sword. O.K., that wasn't distracting enough for her. Her eyes widened as the sword, knife, whatever, was raised and then..../p[Chapter 4] The Meeting p \"Boo!\" Dorothy shrieked at Kate as she jumped almost over the couch./p p What a perfect joke! God, just how gullable was Kate? Ooooo I'm the big mean scary thing come to kill her Ooooo! She could barely contain he rlaughter, and it showed./p p Kate hit Dorothy lightly and roleld her eyes. She walked straight out of the lounge and into someone. /p p \"Oh, I'm so sorry.\" she pleaded in a rush. Then took a minute to study the man. Tall, strong, brown hair and eyes. Beautiful eyes. Eyes that seemed to be peering into your soul./p p \"Hey! It's alright.\" he said with a smile. One that would make you melt as a matter of fact. \" I'm Adam.\" he smirked./p p \"Uh Kate.\" she smield in return but then frowned, somethign was familiar about him. Oh too familiar! \" Have we met before?\" /p p \"Perhaps in my dreams.\" he remarked to recieve a blusha nd smile. \"Truthfully, I just moved here and thought this would be a good idea. Meeting people.\"/p p \"You should stick with us, it's my party anyways.\" stated Dorothy walking out of the room and winking at him./p p \"I'd like that.\" he slightly smiled back, a bit of malice in it as well as he followed the two out to the party./p[Chapter 5] The Boyfriend p An hour or so had passed at the party. Adam made sure to take mental notes on each of the girls. Newer information, that is asside from all of it he already had, was always good. There might be some small detail he missed. One very, very important detail, that if left untouched, could ruin everything. And then i he /i showed up./p p Angel Boreanez was your typical, drool worthy boyfriend. Kate loved every detail about him. And he knew it. He loved everythign about her in return as well. Thats why they were so perfect together, and everyone knew it. Nothing could break them apart. Nothing at all. /p p Oh yes, Adam thought, he'd have to be dealt with. And he knew just the way to do it too. A little distraction. Some time to have Kate by herself, then some way to be in two places at once. It was simple enough, he concluded with a sly grin. This would be all too easy./p p \"So you say your a doctor?\" Adam began taking mental notes, which he was so good at./p p \"Yeah, but it's not all my life. Kate is. \" he smiled./p p Adam scowled then noticed a drink tray comming this way and he stopped the carrier, and distributed drinks./p p \"A toast!\" Adam began, \"to the party!\"/p p\"A toast!\" they all rang out gidily, not noticing the small vial depart from the rim of Stephanie Departo's glass to his pocket./p p A few minutes later Adam pulled Kate to the side to talk. As Stephanie dropped to the floor. Kat enever saw, so she'd never worry. Her mind would be clear for him. Meanwhile, Angel and some of the others rushed tot he hospital with her./p p Their conversation grew and grew. Finally, Kate looked around for her lover to find he wasn't there. She sighed. Adam gave her a concerned glance./p p\"Need a ride home?\" she nodded and they left. This would work perfectly. He thought. Everything will be perfect. As perfect as Kate. /p[Chapter 6] The Murders p Angel paced in the small room where Stephanie was laying. Half dead. He has asked to be alone. To think. There had to be soem way to save her. He looked at teh clock 3 A.M. Kate must still be at the party. He remembered that she hadn't come with the other girls and looked at Stephanie. He had a nurse look after her then left for the house. /p p The Mansion was deserted when he got there. He strolled thru the gardens looking for Kate. She probably got a ride home. As he turned he saw a figure dressed in black. He was wearing a cupid mask./p p \"Can I help you?\" Angel stated. The figure shook its cherubic head and held out a dagger. Slicing into Angel's throat and chopping brutally at his heart./p p The body was soon hiden. Adam checked his watch at his apartment. 3:23 A.M. Two deaths in 23 minutes. Angel, 'mysteriously murdered' and Stephanie, 'intoxicated past tolerancy' well, actually poisoned but they would never figure that out.

She put her boots on and stepped into the grass. She always set her alarm for eleven, and after being sure no one else was awake, she snuck outside to see Flicka. Everyone worked so hard on the ranch that they were usually asleep by ten. She had been sneaking out for four nights now and no one had caught her. She had worked with horses all of her life but had never trained one by herself. Maybe if she could train Flicka to be a proper saddle horse her dad would see what she was capable of and give her a shot at running the ranch. Katy stuck her hand through the fence and offered an apple to Flicka. The mare snorted. She could smell the apple but was still a little weary of Katy. Katy held still, and after five minutes the mare couldn't take it anymore and walked to her. Flicka took the apple from Katy's hand and ate it. Katy smiled and slowly slid through the fence panels. Flicka trotted to the other side of the pen. Katy leaned against the panels and waited for Flicka to get comfortable with her presence. It was slow work but the mare was already doing better than she had the first night. Katy was in a yellow tank top and boot cut blue jeans. Her brown cowboy boots didn't have any spurs because they weren't good for horses, and they were noisy. It was cool at nights, without being cold. Katy loved this time of year. Her dark red hair flowed down her back, wisps of it floating in the light breeze. Flicka walked back to Katy to sniff at her hands. Katy ran her hands up the mare's neck and began to scratch her ears. Then Katy put her hands on Flicka's withers and lifted herself off of the ground. The mare threw her head back and snorted. Katy jumped away and the mare laid back her ears. Katy took a few steps back and so did the horse, then the horse flung her head at Katy. Katy hopped back through the panels just as the mare charged at her. As Katy flung herself through the bars she lost her balance. She hit the ground with a thud and laid there for a moment, disappointed. She was trying to decide what to do next when suddenly there were footsteps beside her. \"Katy! Are you okay? What are you doing?\" It was Jack. He was in a white undershirt and wrangler jeans. She glanced at his boots then sat up. \"I'm fine. I was just petting her and she spooked.\" Katy sat up and looked at Jack, hoping he would stay quiet and not be mad at her. She liked Jack; they had spent a lot of time together over the years, fixing fence and herding horses. Jack looked at her with wide eyes. \"You were not just petting her. I saw you, you were trying to get on her back.\" Katy stood up and gave Jack a halfhearted smile. Then a thought occurred to her and the smile left her face. \"Wait. Where did you come from? Were you walking up here? You spooked her!\" Jack paused for a moment before he answered in an angry whisper. \"I did not spook her! I came up here to tell you that you're crazy, and you're gonna get hurt.\" \"How did you even know I was out here!?\" \"I heard the horse snorting and was afraid that the cougar had wandered up to the house, so I looked out here and saw you. When I realized what you were doing I thought I better come stop you.\" \"I am working with her. I'm going to train her, she's going to be a good horse.\" Katy said defiantly. \"Your dad said not to. You should go back to the house and forget about this.\" Jack was speaking quietly and trying to reason with Katy, but she wasn't listening. \"You scared her. She'll be fine now, watch!\" With that Katy slipped back into the pen before Jack could reach her to stop her. Flicka danced around nervously for a moment. \"Here girl. C'mere girl. It's okay.\" Katy was talking in a breathy voice to the horse and it seemed to be working. Jack was standing still watching in disbelief. Flicka walked forward toward Katy. Suddenly she put her ears back and bared her teeth. Katy backed up to the side of the pen. \"It's okay girl, you know I won't hurt you.\" But Flicka was spooked and not listening. She charged Katy again. Katy squatted down and started to crawl under the bottom panel of the pen. Jacked pulled Katy under the bottom panel, out of the pen and into his lap. He wrapped his arms around her protectively and pulled her to his chest. She sat on his thighs breathing hard. Flicka snorted and trotted in circles. She turned and looked over her left shoulder at him. She started to speak but found herself speechless. His eyes were so beautiful. The shape of Jack's lips made her heart flutter and right now his lips were very close to her own. She looked from his lips to his eyes a few times trying to figure out what to say. Jack wasn't saying anything either. Then he looked at Katy's lips, and Katy knew that he was thinking what she was thinking. She thought, 'I'm already making crazy decisions, why not?' She leaned slightly forward and caught Jacks bottom lip between her lips. She froze with her eyes closed, waiting to see what Jack would do. Jack slowly closed his eyes. After a moment he put his right hand on the back of Katy's neck, sliding his hand into her hair. He opened his mouth slightly and kissed her back. Katy turned a little and slid her hands onto Jack's shoulders. Jack's left hand was on her hip and he tightened his grip. He turned his head and kissed her harder, loving the feel of her soft lips. Katy breathed in through her nose and kept kissing him. Jack knew that this was a bad idea, but he had a special place in his heart for Katy and couldn't make himself pull away. Katy gently sucked on his bottom lip then she opened her lips against his and he couldn't help but slip his tongue inside. After they swirled their tongues around for a moment Jack pulled back and looked in Katy's eyes. She didn't look afraid or even unsure of herself. She kept her hands on his shoulders and looked into his eyes. \"You know this is crazy right? You know your dad will kill me if he finds us like this.\" \"My dad wouldn't kill anyone. And no one else is awake. We can sit here for a little while.\" Katy said suggestively. Jack sat still, he really wanted to keep kissing Katy, but he also did not want to get caught kissing Katy. He had seen her dad wrestle calves and had no doubt the man could give him a sound beating if he felt like it. He shook his head and started to speak but Katy pressed her lips to his again and he forgot what his argument was. He kissed her for a little while, enjoying the feel of her being so close to him. They had been around each other a lot in the past, but not recently since she had been at school, and Jack had found himself missing her. He liked catching the scent of her perfume on the air, or the scent of her shampoo. Right now the breeze was blowing softly and he could feel her hair brushing his cheek and smell the flowery scent. Jack pulled away again, this time picking Katy up by her sides and sitting her on the ground. \"We have to stop. You have to go back to bed. I have to go back to bed. We can't do this.\" He shook his head and gave her a serious look. Katy paused and looked around. Here they were sitting on the ground in the middle of the barnyard, it wasn't smart. She nodded and stood up. \"Goodnight.\" Katy walked back to the house. Stopping at the porch to take off her boots, she looked back. Jack was standing at the edge of the barnyard making sure she made it to the house. Katy smiled. This wasn't over. ","Summary":" Katy tiptoed onto the porch in socked feet then sat down on the edge.

Enjoy!(: Warning: some cursing and slight adult situations. Reviews would be lovelyy(: Disclaimer: I do not own anything that may relate to the movie, and or the books. Katy watched from atop a horse's back, not Flicka, in the distance, a herd of wild horses graced the land. They kicked up a lot of dust. There were many. More than she'd ever seen in one herd alone. They normally hid from civilization. Choosing to live in peace rather than get sucked into all the troubles of our world. Katy couldn't blame them. If she could, she'd run. Far away, from her parents, her brother, school, everything! The politics, rules, and laws of the human race are far to complicated. I highly doubt the government even knows what's going on. Yet these horses, in a world to call their very own, live in peace. They speak to one another, in their own designated language. They have a pecking order, which is to say their form of government. Each herd is led by one horse. They fight it out. Each horse has a shot. They don't place tacky ads, or hire people to call every five minutes to vote for you. They have a real free country. There aren't many wild horses now. Most were shot and killed over the centuries and the ones that are left hide well. One of the mustangs, a cream color, limped into the clearing of land behind a tall, gallant, grey. Katy felt sympathy towards the small mare, but knew if she even offered her hand to help, the horses would scatter. Change isn't good, sometimes. In this case, of the wild horses, it would ruin them. She highly doubted they've ever been in human contact, so if she did, it would set them off. They'd run. And may or may not make it back together, again, as a herd. She watched, longingly, as they ran across the fields, stretching their legs. They tossed their heads around and ran at each other, playfully. She tried to decipher who was lead. The grey, seemed to be leading the herd at one point. Then another horse, this one a tobiano Paint, would chase the grey. But the grey would turn on him too. The mares, scolded their young, and grazed the tall grass that covered the plain. The fillies bit and kicked playfully at each other. And tried to get in on their elders fights, earning them another scolding from them and their mothers. Horses are a work of art. They are, literally, poetry in motion. They grace the presence of the few who care to take a look. But they are not just a pretty picture to be admired. They are living things to be appreciated. In history, war was not fought, nor won without horses. Many more horses lost their lives than men. Horses, or taking care of them in anyway, is not a hobby to be picked up and set down later. It is a way of life. Riding as a hobby, is cruel to the horse you ride. Horses need someone to be there for them when they are down. As they find complacency in being there for their rider when they are down. You have to be in sync with your horse. Be one with the horse. Feel the muscles in their body flex as they prepare to run. Feel the rhythm of their breathing. Stay steady with the rhythm of the horses gait. Flow with them. Not against them. Live beside the horse. Not on top. People are no match for a horse. Horses tell their own story, and not in a wrap-around sort of way. No explanations, they show. No lead up, straight to the point. If you really take a look, you can learn a lot from a horse. Not just wild ones either. The tame always have some wild in them. Hence the term \"bomb-proof.\" There is no bomb proof horse. Any horse can be spooked. They will rear or buck, or simply run off. That is the wild that was passed down, through many generations, to them. Knowing a horses name, and riding it once or twice, is not knowing a horse. To know them, you spend time with them. You learn their vices, and work to help them out of them. You learn their habits. Flicka, as wild as she still is, is someone's horse. She will not just leave Katy if she lets her go off on her own. She will come back. Because where Katy is, home is, to Flicka. It's how most horses are. But being she is telling her to leave, that rule may not apply. Once you gain their trust, they will always consider where you are home. A horse's trust is a gift to be honored by, not just something you take notice of every once in a while. Horses have fears, just as people do. To Katy, right now, looking out into the fields of tall grass and watching the wild horses roam, her fear is that that will be taken away from them. Though people don't normally hunt horses these days, there are still some sick people out there that are willing to do it. She'd grown up with horses her entire life. Never once had she been this sad to see one go. Flicka had been her best friend her entire summer break. Though that wasn't long, it had felt like forever. Now, she'd be going back to the Academy. Her thoughts would always drift back to Flicka, wherever she would be. She would see her again one day, but for now. This would be Goodbye .

It's a large log house in the deep forest with streams and large cedar trees. My older sister Cheyenne, My mom, and my dad start taking boxes out of the car. I go to the trailer that's holding Tuesday (My horse) I open the trailer doors and Tuesday looks back at me. She's a 15.9 hand tall black Friesian mare and 9 years old. I got her when I was 5 (when I started riding) I untie her lead rope and turn her around and she leans her head down and rubs her head on my white tank top. \"Tuesday! Not my white shirt!\" I laugh at her and then I start walking her to the stable in the backyard. \"Whoa…\" We both stare at the Huge Stone stable with and fairly big indoor area. We walk in and see the large stalls that are dark cedar and the floors are just your ordinarily stable brick floors. It's dimly lit with light bulbs stuck onto small logs. I put her in a stall with a gold name plate that says Tuesday. She whinnies and bogs her head. \"Are you okay girl?\" I walk in and settle her down I look into her beautiful icy blue eyes. Whispers \"it's okay girl, you'll be fine\". I go up to the hayloft and get her a few flakes of hay and fill her water bucket. I take off her halter and put her royal purple blanket so she won't get chilly. I walk back to the house and start helping load the boxes into the new log house. Its 5:00 pm and we just have finished load all the boxed and furniture into the house. I go change into sweatpants and a baggy burgundy sweater. My mom asks me to go pick a room. I go up the beautiful spiral stairs that are the same dark cedar wood as our house but with a black railing. I finally reach the top and I see three different rooms the master (For my parents), but then I see two other rooms. One overlooking the forest, mountains, and the streams.

It was an 'Ooops' foal, conceived when the ranch's top stallion had broken down a gate and gotten in with some the mares. It was a colt, tall and gangly with a hammer-head and frizzy black mane. It struggled to rise, encouraged by its mother's nuzzles. Gradually it gained its feet and huddled close to its mother, searching for a teat. It didn't find one and nipped at her in frustration. Flicka winced but stood patiently till the colt finally found what he was looking for. Katie was, needless to say, delighted with the foal. She spent hours with him and his dam, petting them and, once he was older, teaching him to lead and pick up his hooves. The colt was….challenging. He reared and bit when he was first haltered and was constantly testing his handler even once he was used to the lead. Katie's family watched with building worry as he got bigger and wilder. Whisky, as they were calling him, soon reached five months of age and was separated him from his mother. Flicka wasn't overly worried about the fence between them (despite her son's panicked prancing), and soon went out to the high pastures with the rest of the herd. Whisky, who was a vivacious foal, completely forgot his mother within a few days and started bullying the other weanlings. He was the fastest, strongest, largest weanling in the pasture. He could outrun a frightened jackrabbit, out-jump a deer with the hunter on its heels, and win any mean-ness contest outright. Katie returned from boarding school and started trying to tame him, though without much success. He would halter and lead quietly at first, but the instant he though you had done enough to him, he would become a devil incarnate, rearing, bucking, kicking, biting, and bolting. Not even her father could hold him when he decided to take off. They decided to try the rope-drag method. They haltered him and let him loose in the round pen. He took a step forward, stood on the lead rope, and exploded. He bucked viciously, hurling himself sideways and snapping at the rope. He hit the ground and stamped on the rope, once, twice, three times! That was the end of the rope. It snapped and he galloped triumphantly around the pen, occasionally pausing to stamp it victoriously. That was the end of their rope-drag session. It was a hot day not long after the disastrous rope-drag episode and storm clouds had been building on the horizon all day. Now, the sky to the West and the North of the ranch was black, illuminated only by flashes of lightning. The wind started picking up, sending dust hissing across the pasture hard enough to leave you breathless. Whisky and the other weanlings were milling close the small run-in shed in the corner of the pasture, prancing in circles in the hot pre-tempest air. The clouds moved in. The wind howled against the shed's roof and rain pelted down, flattening the grass and soaking anything outside in a moment, yet Whisky stood a little outside the shelter and watched the storm's fury lash the pastures. Lightning scythed pink-white in the depths of the cloud and crashed down, striking a tree in front of him. Whisky spooked, eyes rolling and showing white, as a spark of energy from the downed tree lanced up and caught him in the face. He spun and galloped across the pasture, clearing the fence and whirling away into the empty vastness of the mountains. When Katie came out to inspect the damage the next morning, the only sign of him were hoof marks in the mud and a knot of black hair twisted onto a barbed wire fence… ","Summary":" Colt On a cold morning in early August, Flicka had her foal.

It's Love here. I have been getting a lot of questions about the new school year and how some of you are nervous. You shouldn't be! You will meet old and new friends! Everyone will be nice and teachers will go easy on you. Don't stress about it! Have fun on your first few days! -Negative Love \"And send.\" I said as I hit the enter button on my computer. I collapsed on my chair and let out a sigh. I totally act differently then how I sound on the internet. Hi, I'm Emily Cooper or known as Negative Love. I give people advice on whatever they need. I want to help people with their fears and problems. I am 15. I am probably too young to be giving advice to others, but most of my audience is younger than me or about my age. I try not to talk to older viewers, but it sometimes happens. I hear a few beeps and looked to my computer screen. People were already commenting back and having a conversation with others, giving advice and just being friendly. I'm glad this community is friendly. I follow other bloggers too and I often talk with them. My friends are some of them. Oh right. I forgot I am going to see them today at school. I am going to Highland High and it's my first day. I know I told my viewers to have fun and not be nervous, but I'm nervous! I feel breakfast crawling its way back up. I really don't know if I can do this. There is probably one thing that is motivating me to go to school: Trey Anderson. He is the most popular boy at school and has a bad boy streak going on. He hangs out with only popular people. He will never notice a girl like me. I'm plain, boring, and invisible. I can only dream of being friends with him. I shutter, blush, and say dumb things around him. I can only hope of getting him to talk to me. \"Emily, hurry up! You're going to be late to school! I have to drop off Katy.\" My mom yelled from downstairs. I closed out of my blog and shut down my computer. I hid my computer under my bed and grabbed my backpack. I really hope my first day goes well.[Chapter 2] After my mom dropped me and Katy off, I was left alone to face high school. Well, I'm not really alone. I have my friends here, if I can find them first. They are so different from each other that they would be in different places. But I have a good feeling where everyone would be. I started walking towards the football field. My friend should be there. She probably is as nervous as I am. Her name is Violet Ventimillagia. Most people can't pronounce her name, me being one of those people. She has a rough outer shell that is hardly broken by anyone, except us. Everyone fears her and stays away from her. They just don't know how she is. She may seem that way at the beginning, but once she warms up, she is really nice and has a shy side to her. She will kill me, if I ever tell her that. When I saw the field in sight, I saw a purple figure running the perimeter of it. Knowing she won't notice me, I started running after her. I hear her music blasting through her earbuds. She is also much faster than me, so it's kinda hard to catch up to her. Fifteen minutes later I stopped running. Why did I run after her when I can just wait for her? I plopped down onto the grass and watched her run laps around the field. She didn't notice me until she finished her third lap. She slowly came to a jog and came right up to me. I could see beats of sweat run down her forehead and drip down to her damp shirt. Now that she has stopped running, I can see what she's wearing. Her curly, brown hair had light brown highlights in them and was up into her usual ponytail. She wore a purple tee with a pair of black basketball shorts that looked too big for her tiny frame. Her favorite purple sneakers were covered in bits of grass and mud. I really hope she brought an extra pair of shoes to school today. She took her earbuds out of her ears so she could listen to me properly. \"Oh, hey Emily. Didn't see you there. You could have texted me.\" She said, panting a bit from her run. \"I was going to, but I got here early, so I was going to come and get you.\" I said with a shrug. \"Besides, why are you running first thing in the morning? Now you're going to be smelly in all your classes.\" I commented on her stink. \"Em, don't worry about it. I have PE first period. They're gonna let me shower after class.\" She said. I smiled at her excuse and stood up. I extended my hand towards her and she grabbed it, pulling herself up. She grabbed her bag and phone before following me towards the school building. \"Do you think she's really there? She must be still home, trying to get breakfast from her brothers.\" Violet asked. \"If I know Val, she will be there and will be doing something science-y.\" I said as we continued walking towards the building. Valerie Wishart was one of the smartest kid in our middle school. Her favorite subject is Science and is pretty good at most activities like robotics, tennis, etc. She is sassy and always trying to get better grades than everyone, but she also loves taking care of the environment and the community. When we entered the biology lab, we saw Val reading the biology textbook that was supposed to be handed to us by our teachers. She sat in the back of the empty class. She wore a white shirt that had glasses on them, jean shorts, a red flannel around her waist, and black converses. Her brown hair was pinned to the side, so that it emphasized her face and blue eyes. \"Hey Val! What are you doing?\" Violet asked from across the room. She looked up from her textbook and grinned when she saw us. \"Hey guys! I was just reading our biology book to see what we would learn this year. This stuff is too easy.\" She said casually. \"When you say that, I have a feeling I will fail this year.\" Violet groaned. Violet has a harder time with school then most people. She is usually distracted by the sports she's in. \"Don't worry! We're here to help you, Violet.\" I assured her. She smiled at me and nodded. \"Hey everyone! This is where you went! I was looking for you guys!\" A voice yelled by the doorway. We looked over to see our friend, Cassidy Lara waving dramatically at us. She wore a black shirt with fringe at the bottom. The fringe touched the bottom of her high waisted shorts that were white. She wore her signature black, combat boots on this hot day. Her copper red hair was in a high ponytail and she wore black sunglasses that covered her blue eyes. She has a reputation of being a \"bad girl.\" Rumors flew all around her last year. She has a habit of helping these rumors by flirting with every cute guy that passes us and acting rebellious towards teachers. \"Cassidy! Where did you go?\" Violet asked. \"N-nowhere!\" She shuttered with a blush on her face. Violet and Val looked at each other and grinned. \"You went to see Jerry didn't you?\" Val teased. Her blush became much darker after that comment. \"Of course not! I totally got over him in middle school.\" Cassidy lied, looking somewhere else. \"Cassidy, it's fine if you still like him. He's not that bad of a guy.\" I tried to comfort her. Jerome Martinez or \"Jerry\" is a bad boy. He is worse than Cassidy. Cassidy doesn't get detentions, but Jerry does. He is known for being the biggest player and can pick a fight with anyone because he knows karate. I have heard people say he is strong. \"Em, don't try. I'm as bad as it's going to get. I like bad boys and I'm going to be apart of his many girlfriends!\" She cried. \"I will beat him to a pulp, if he asks you to be apart of his harem.\" Violet threatened. \"Violet, it's not a harem. It's just him cheating.\" Val said. \"I'm sure he changed his ways.\" I tried, giving him the benefit of the doubt. \"M-maybe.\" Cassidy mumbled. \"Here! I will help you see if he is the one!\" I smiled. Cassidy squealed and hugged me. \"Thank you Emily!\" She cried. Deep inside, I know her relationship with Jerry will never happen or end well. I want to wash away my fears of this and try to make her dreams happen. Negative Love will help her get some romance![Chapter 3] The four of us decided to go to the library to commence Plan Jerry-notices-Cassidy-and-Cassidy-gets-a-little-romance. The name still needs work. The only one who could hack the school system is Val. Not only is she trying to become a scientist but she's also good with computers, namely hacking and video games. Violet is also good at video games too but her \"self control\" (or anger issues) is a bit out of control (she has thrown the table at the winner). \"Okay, I have hacked the school system! It was too easy. I have Jerry's schedule.\" Val announced. Cassidy applauded Val's efforts and leaned over the chair to get a better look at the computer. I was over Val's other shoulder. \"I have Biology with him!\" Cassidy squealed while Violet groaned in unison. \"Biology is now my least favorite class.\" Cassidy glared at Violet. I giggled at this childish act but then turned to Val. \"Could you actually get a certain someone's schedule?\" I whispered. She winked at me and started typing on the computer. \"You have English and History with him.\" She whispered back. I smiled at this information and hugged her as a thanks. Val printed a map of the school and erased traces of her hacking. We planned for her to walk with Jerry to Biology and to Jerry's next class. I just hope Cassidy won't chicken out and Jerry won't flirt so much. \"I'm really hungry now. Do you want to get breakfast in the cafeteria?\" Violet asked. We just shrugged and nodded. We headed out of the library and towards the cafeteria. \"Are you trying out for volleyball?\" I asked Violet. \"Yeah, I am and I WILL DOMINATE TRYOUTS!\" She yelled determinedly. We laughed at her competitive nature. \"I was actually thinking of doing volleyball. I think it might be fun.\" Our favorite redhead said shyly. Cassidy and I were always more shy then Val and Violet, but Cassidy would be great in volleyball. She exercises often to keep fit and kept taking those dance lessons on weekends. \"While you do that, I am going to join the Ecology Club. Go green or go home.\" Val joked. \"I wish I could go home. I don't care about saving the planet when it's close to dying.\" Violet shrugged. Val glared at the brunette but just sighed at her lack of concern for the planet. \"I was actually thinking of doing Ecology Club. If you're there Val then I might actually join.\" I said to her. She smiled at me and nodded. \"We're finally here! I am so hungry that I could eat a horse!\" Violet dramatically shouted. We rolled our eyes at her exaggeration and entered the cafeteria. We got into line and grabbed our breakfast. Cassidy grabbed a banana and yogurt while Violet got waffles and an apple, Val got pancakes and an orange, and I got a muffin and a bottle of water. We walked over to a table by the windows and sat down to enjoy our food. Violet and Val drowned their food in maple syrup while Cassidy and I started taking small bites into ours. \"Why do you even like pancakes anyway? Waffles are better.\" Violet stated. Oh no. \"Waffles? No way! Pancakes are better!\" Val argued. \"Pancakes are too thin! They don't fill you up! Waffles are thick and can hold more maple syrup!\" Violet retorted back. \"Pancakes are fluffy and soft! They're easier to eat then waffles!\" Val and Violet kept going back and forth while Cassidy and I watched the madness unfold. I just hope they don't get physical.[Chapter 4] Luckily, no one got hurt. Unluckily, we got kicked out of the cafeteria and had to hang out at my locker. Last year we all shared one locker together because we always hang out together. Also, Cassidy and Violet kept forgetting their combination and we always had to search for it. It was just easier to share one locker. \"You all have first period gym right?\" Violet asked us as we left our books in my locker. We all nodded and went to the locker room to get changed. We all hate changing in the same room, but we have to deal with it. We are not what people would called 'cute' and 'pretty.' Lots of guys don't even like hanging out with us. It doesn't matter though. We have each other. After we awkwardly changed with other girls in the changing room, we just quickly headed towards the gym. \"I really hope we get to play football!\" Violet said. \"Football is horrible! Somehow my nose gets broken by the end of it!\" Cassidy cried. \"That's because you suck at catching ball.\" Val commented with a snicker. Cassidy glared at her and pouted. \"Don't worry Cassidy. I will make sure your nose doesn't get hit.\" I joked while my girls laughed. \"But I don't think they would do that to us today. I'm pretty sure we will do something easy.\" Val said. We just joked around some more before the teacher came. The teacher was my worst nightmare. He made us run laps all the way until we had to go change! I am able to do sports but ALL THOSE LAPS HURT! My legs are sore and my hips hurt. Everyone is definitely in better shape then me. I probably need a hospital check up after this while everyone is surviving. Actually, I saw a classmate get sent to the nurse's office. Better remember his face so I can ask if he will be better tomorrow. \"Geez Em. You really need to exercise more.\" Violet commented. I glared at her for stating the obvious but just quietly went to the locker with her to change for next period. \"Ugh, I have history next.\" Cassidy complained as she put on her shirt. \"Try having math next period.\" Val argued. \"Try having math with Val.\" Violet groaned which earned her a death glare from Val that she just had to return back. I laughed at their playful dislike for each other. They always do this but in the end they are close friends. The bell decided to ring, ending first period. Time to face English class.[Chapter 5] Oh my gosh. I have English Class with Trey Anderson. I'm excited but nervous. I hope I don't embarrass myself. I arrived pretty early to class so I just took a seat near the front. Why? Everyone wants the back seats because that's where the teacher can't see you. Tolerable students sit near the front and annoying ones sit in the back. Basic knowledge. Slowly, everyone came in, dreading of the torture that's about to come. I am too but I'm pretty good in English class. Passed last year with a B. After the bell rang, everyone was in their seats but the teacher wasn't here yet. I shrugged and just started texting the girls in our group chat. Me : Omg the teacher isn't here yet Cassidy : Nice. My teacher came and he's an old man. He started talking about his life story or whatever Me : That sucks for you Violet : I can't take this class anymore. The teacher is already teaching us something and I don't understand Me : I will help you later, Vi Cassidy : I will probably need help later too Val : Everyone, stop texting in class Me : The teacher isn't here yet so it's fine Cassidy : THIS TEACHER IS BORING! I WILL HAPPILY TEXT IN CLASS! Violet : I'm too cool for school Me : This is why I have as your emoji Violet : SHOOT! IM GONNA GET CAUGHT! LATER! Cassidy : About to get caught too. Peace out Girl scouts. Val : This is why we don't text in class I turned off my phone as they ended the conversation. It's boring without them texting in the chat. Just then the teacher finally appeared. She quietly opened the door and strolled into the room. Her purple dress fluttering a bit because it was a bit too short. She wore black leggings underneath the dress and grey heel boots. She would be the same height as us if it wasn't for the boots. She wore a black cardigan to cover her arms and shoulders and had on a few gold rings to compliment the outfit, her wedding ring included. \"Hello class. I'm Mrs. Cox. I'm gonna be the new teacher. All of you guys are smart students so I don't need to go over the rules. Annoy me, you get a detention. Disrespect me and you get a detention. Do something stupid and you get a detention. Don't even try anything. I am giving you guys 3 days to work on a presentation about a country of your choice. I have picked your partners so I will put the paper on the board.\" She announced as she stuck a piece of paper on the white board. She then went to her desk and started working on her computer. Everyone came crowding towards the front, wanting to see who their partner is. A lot of people cheered that their partner is a friend or someone tolerable. A few groaned at the disaster they have to call partner. I mentally groaned at who my partner will be. I don't even like a lot of people in this class. Before I got up to look at the list, someone approached me. \"Hey so the teacher kinda put us together for this project and I kinda wasn't paying attention to what she was saying so can you explain what we're going to do?\" He nervously explained to me. Oh. My. Gosh. I can't believe this. My partner is Jerry Martinez. Aka the guy my friend is crushing on.[Chapter 6] I can't believe I have to work with Jerry Martinez. He is SO obnoxious and does not do his work. I can't fail the beginning of the semester! My mom will take away my privileges if I start failing! I can't even stay at home alone! I won't even be allowed out of the house with my bad grades! I angrily plopped down on my seat at my lunch table. \"Woah, who broke your computer?\" Violet asked as she scooted a bit away from her angered friend. Val glared at her rude action and nudged her, causing Violet to go back to her original spot. These two can never just get along. \"No one 'broke my computer.' I have to work with the most ANNOYING partner ever.\" I explained as I started taking sips from my water. Violet rolled her eyes at that and started eating her hamburger. \"Emily, it's okay. If your partner won't help you then we can. Our schedules are different and the teacher won't know.\" Forever the soother, Cassidy tried to calm me down. Cassidy was right. \"Yeah, it's okay. It's fine. It's only for this week and then it's over.\" I told myself as I started biting into my sandwich. Just then some blonde cheerleader came over to our table. Much too happy and preppy for a day in high school but that's how all cheerleaders are, except Violet. She gave all of us a piece of paper. \"You are totally invited to McKenna's party. Welcome to Highland!\" She cheerfully said and left, passing out more invites to people nearby. \"Woah, a cheerleader talked to us.\" Val sarcastically announced as she started looking at the details of the invite. \"Saturday? Shoot, I wanted to stay home and paint all day.\" Cassidy sighed as she tossed the invite back onto the table and went back to drawing in her sketchbook. \"Parties are lame anyway. Got a game I gotta see.\" Violet rolled her eyes as she also tossed it back and spun a basketball in her hand. \"I was gonna experiment on which fertilizer helps my plants grow faster.\" Val also gave an excuse. I was not having any of this. \"Girls, this is totally what we need. We are high schoolers! We gotta live a little. A party is what we need to spice up our careers.\" I encouraged them but they all gave me a blank stare. \"Forget it, Emily. Introverts like us aren't going to take the time to socialize with society.\" Val rolled her eyes. \"We must do this!\" I pleaded to them. \"Never gonna happen, Em.\" Violet said. I looked towards Cassidy but she turned away, betraying me. \"Fine then. Girls day with me then if you aren't going to the party.\" I decided as the bell rung, ending lunch. ","Summary":" Hey everyone. It's Love here. I have been getting a lot of questions about the new school year and "},{"Movie":"Flicka","Title":"Flicka's Granddaughter","Author":"Moonlight Marching","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8403707","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 AN: Okay guys, first fanfic here I come! I really hope you guys like it, for some reason I'm in a horsie mood, so this one will be a original version of Flicka! Think of it as Flicka 3... or 4. I think there's a third one now, but I'm unsure. 'The stories we here of how the west was one were all lies. The history of the west was written by the horse. Wherever a settler left his foot print there was a hoof print right beside it. Man came further and further west to stake their claims on the great American wilderness, but they encountered a strength that could not be tamed: wild horses. The settlers called them parasites that could strip the land and starve their own herd. They couldn't domesticate them so they destroyed them. Isolated and hungry they were on their way to disappearing from the face of the earth. Sometimes when the lie disappears an after image remains, just for a moment mustangs are an after image. No better than ghosts, hardly there at all. No one really wants them not ranchers, not city people. That's their destiny; let them disappear once and for all with all the other misfits, loners and relics of the wilderness no one cares about anymore. Lucky for us a few mustangs survived, hidden away in the mountains. We need to protect them for them, for they are the hope for some kind of living memory of what the promise of America used to be, and could be again. I believer there is a force in this world that lives beneath the surface; something primitive and wild that awakens when we need an extra push just to survive, like wildflowers that bloom after a wildfire burns the forest black. Most people are afraid of it and keep it buried deep inside them, but there will always be a few people who have the courage to love what is untamed inside of us. ' Kaia closed the essay book, looking up at her father with a confused look on her face. \"What does this have to do with me?\" she asked, holding out the book for him to take. Clint eyed her, his annoyance showing in his eyes. He took it, holding it gently, as if it was going to fall into dust at any second. \"This was your grandmother Katy's.\" he said, going over and setting it on her dresser. \"She was my mother, and she showed me that determination, and love were two of the three things that make up life.\" Kaia leaned back on her pillow, staring up at the ceiling. The walls around her were covered with horse posters, and her shelves covered with horse books. On her dresser, along with the newly placed essay, were rows upon rows of horse competition trophies. Ribbons hung along the edge of the mirror above it, lining it in a ring of blue, red, green, and yellow. \"What's the third?\" she asked, though she knew the answer. Her father didn't move, his eyes trailing along Kaia's show of her skill with her previous horse, Buckshot. \"Kaia.\" he said \"You can't just not ride anymore. I know Buckshot was special to you, and that accident was bad, but there's nothing you can do about it. I know your scared of losing something else. You don't think I don't think of that every time I get on a horse? I'm scared of leaving you alone in the world. Your mothers gone, and there's nothing we can do about it. But you can do what would make her proud, and get back up on a horse! Buckshot would want you to.\" Kaia sat back up, tears in here eyes. \"Buckshot is dead, Daddy! And it's all my fault. If I hadn't taken him so far that day, we would've gotten back before that storm! Then Buckshot would be alive, and I'd be riding in the Championships next month. Just like last year, and the three other years before it.\" Clint turned around, fixing Kaia with a stare. \"Sweetie.\" he said \"That storm coming round was not your fault. There was no warning, nothing. The skies were clear that morning, and there was nothing on the news about a storm. You had no control over the mudslide, or the fact you couldn't get away. No control Kaia, None. Now, tomorrow morning, you are coming down to the barn, and you are going to start caring for that foal that your grandmother gave you. Got it?\" Kaia blinked, her grey eyes falling onto the photo on her bedside table, of her grandmother Katy, her cousin Carrie, and a black horse thats name hadn't escaped a single ear across the state of Wyoming. Flicka. \"Daddy?\" she said \"What ever happened Flicka's foal? The one that Carrie found with her when she brought her back from the wild?\" Clint smiled \"You'll find out in the morning. Let's just say that colt knew your new horse pretty well. Good Night, Kaia.\" \"Good Night Daddy.\" Kaia said, laying back on her bed again, pulling her blanket up close to her. She watched her father turn out the light, and shut the door with a small click, plunging her into darkness.[Chapter 2] Author's Note: Short chapter, I know. It's what I'm famous for, sadly. I'm working on making my chapters longer. Anyway, Sorry this took sooooooo long to make, I'm embarrassed to say I'd forgotten about it. I'm going to be faster on the next one, promise. Please review and tell me what you think! Again, I'm not one to frown at mean reviews. They'll help me get better! Also, excuse my spelling mistakes, if you find any. I did spell check, but still, I've had my spell check make mistakes before. Who knows when it'll happen again? Chapter 2: The next morning, Kaia opened her eyes to a loud silence. She blinked back the tears that immediately came to her eyes. It used to be, that every morning, Buckshot would whinny real loudly from the pasture connected to the barn, and wake her up. And only her. She was the lightest sleeper out of her and her father, and the stable hands all lived in the barn. But they all slept like rocks from the work they did all day with the horses, and the ranch. Kaia sighed. It seemed to her everything was just to quiet since Buckshot... left. All the ranch hands wouldn't talk to her, for a reason she didn't understand, and all the other horses weren't as loud as Buckshot had been. She stood, going over to her closet and slowly got dressed in her usual t-shirt, jeans, and western boots. She picked her hat up off of the hook by the door, opening it with her other hand and walking out. She knew nobody else was yet awake, for it was only 5:30, according to the wall clock right outside her room. She headed downstairs, pulling the orange juice and some other supplies out of the refrigerator and starting breakfast up, as she did every morning. Kaia smiled and looked up when her little beagle puppy, Bailey, walked in. \"Hey boy!\" she said, reaching down and patting his head. Bailey barked happily, and nudged her leg with his nose. \"Shhhhh\" Kaia whispered. \"You'll wake everyone up!\" She dropped the eggs she'd been making onto a platter, and set the breakfast on the table. She'd been making meals for the ranch hands and her father ever since her mom had left. They're probably thoroughly tired of eggs and pancakes by now, Kaia thought, heading into the living room. She smiled at the picture of her, and Buckshot as a foal on the wall, feeling tears prick the backs of her eyes. Shaking her head, Kaia turned determinedly away from the picture. \"Pancakes and Eggs again ?\" Kaia jumped and turned to see the youngest farm hand, Jackson, standing at the door, behind him, Horace and Trace, the other two farm hands, moaned. Kaia put her hands on her hips. \"Well,\" she replied. \"When you give me an order for a meal that isn't eggs and pancakes, I'll make it. At you're own risk. Remember last time? You know I'm not a good cook.\" Horace made a face. \"Well, isn't there a cooking class at that public school of yours? Take that.\" Kaia rolled her eyes. \"I am. So far, all I'm learning is how to make pancakes.\" All three of them moaned, and the floorboards above their heads creaked. \"Boss is awake,\" Trace said. \"Better get to work.\" \"Better eat your food,\" Kaia said. \"Now sit down, all of you.\" Horace muttered something about her being just like her mother, and him, Jackson, and Trace sat down at the table, serving themselves some food. \"Now, Kaia, you can go down to the barn and take care of that foal of yours.\" Kaia turned, a scowl placing itself on her face. \"My foal? Not so much my foal as a horse you've placed on me so I'll stop remembering Buckshot. But guess what Daddy? I will NEVER forget him! Never!\" she turned and walked out the door, slamming it shut behind her. \"Don't worry Boss, she'll come 'round. I saw that little filly myself this morn', and boy she's a cute one. Firey to, just like her grandmother.\" Trace said, taking a bite of pancake. \"I sure hope so,\" Clint replied, taking his seat at the table.

I really hope you guys like it, for some reason "},{"Movie":"Flicka","Title":"Back in the Saddle","Author":"kaisalune","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5581917","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The recovery progress had been a long one. Katy McLaughlin had been desperate to ride Flicka ever since her father had shown the beautiful mustang to her after she had become well enough to venture outside. Katy found it difficult to describe the immense feeling of love for the horse – her brother Howard didn't really understand the bond Katy and Flicka shared. He had said himself that horses were all the same – all had four legs, the food went in one end and out the other. Katy missed Howard terribly. He had gone off to college and from the moment Howard had told her of the scholarship, Katy feared her brother would never come back to the ranch. Her father pretended not to mind that Howard was gone, but Katy could see that he missed his son too. Her mother just tried to stay busy. Katy finally knew the effect she had on her parents when she went off to boarding school. She didn't really understand their logic – if they disliked her absence and she hated the school, what was the point of paying those outrageous fees when it made them all unhappy? Why not send her to the local school in Wyoming? She supposed she would now, now that Howard was gone and the ranch was hers. The fact excited her – she would one day be in charge of Goose Ridge Ranch. Now, finally, Katy and Flicka were both ready to ride again, to be free. Katy woke up that particular morning with a thrill through her veins. It was only 6 am. Katy was eager to go out and ride immediately, but her father had made her promise that she would not go out by herself. The condition was that he rode with Katy and Flicka to make sure they were both okay. Katy got dressed slowly, trying to drag the action out so it wouldn't be so long to wait before she could go riding. It was stupid logic, but Katy was content in believing in it. She went downstairs and paused at her favourite painting hanging on the wall at the landing. How many times had she stopped to look at this piece of canvas? Too many to count. \"About time you go up.\" Katy gasped and turned. \"Daddy. You scared me,\" she said. He laughed. \"Hon, I knew you'd be up early so I thought I'd beatcha to it. Ready to ride?\" Katy nodded eagerly. \"Yeah.\" She ran to her father and put an arm around him, hugging him. It wasn't often that she made this gesture, but the joy she felt at the thought of riding Flicka again made her be impulsive. He laughed again and hugged her back. \"C'mon – I ain't tacking up for you.\" Katy was glad. Her father wasn't being her father if he did everything for her. He liked his kids to work for themselves, and Katy valued that in her father. Jack and Gus were already in the stables when Katy and Rob arrived. \"Hard at work fellers?\" said Rob, smiling. \"You know it boss,\" said Jack, tipping his hat. \"Well, I am. Gus just got up.\" \"Yeah, sure,\" said Gus. Katy had a new respect for Gus ever since he had given her the idea to name her wild mustang Flicka. Flicka had been a name that Gus had used for Katy once, but it had been given to her horse now. It meant 'pretty, young girl', and the name gave off an essence of freedom. \"Enough talking!\" Katy said. \"I want to go runnin'!\" The phrase gave Katy an intense feeling of déjà vu. The morning after she had arrived home from boarding school she had said something along those lines. \"Who wants to go runnin'?\" Now she didn't have to ask. She had Flicka. \"Right, right. Better not keep Katy waiting, boss,\" said Jack. \"You know how she gets.\" \"Oh, funny Jack,\" said Katy, rolling her eyes. He was always the joker. \" C'mon !\" Rob shrugged and followed Katy down the aisle of stalls. \"Alright Katy, I'm gonna tack up Yankee. You go get Flicka.\" Katy went to the stall that her father had generously donated for her horse, but Flicka was not there. Gus was walking down the aisle with a bridle. \"Flicka's in the paddock by the corral.\" Katy went into the tack shed and got her saddle and bridle before heading out. The corral brought back many memories. It had been Flicka's home for so long, when her father had forbidden her to ride the beautiful black mustang. Katy saw Flicka grazing in the middle of the paddock. Her heartbeat accelerated at the thought of riding that beauty again. \"Flicka!\" she called. The horse's head came up as she scanned the fence line for Katy. When she spotted her mistress she whinnied loud and clear, pawed the ground once and then took off at a light canter. Katy climbed over the fence and put her arms around her horse, breathing in Flicka's strong horse scent. Katy ran her hand over Flicka's neck and withers, feeling the slight bumps of the scars there. She was healed. Katy tried to keep the memory of that night out of her head but it was difficult at times. Flicka had thrown Katy off, trying to keep her away from danger. Katy had been astounded – she had believed Flicka trusted her completely by that moment. But then the mountain lion had fell onto Flicka from a tree and the sharp screams of her horse echoed through the mountains. Katy had desperately thrown rocks at the lion before it ran off, but the damage had been done. Katy had feared Flicka's life was at an end – her father had gone out to shoot her, or so she had thought. Katy saddled and bridled Flicka, running her hands over the mustang's sturdy legs. Then she led Flicka over to the stables where her father was waiting. \"All set?\" said Rob, who was already mounted on Yankee. \"You bet,\" said Katy. She swung up into the saddle and felt at home for the first time in weeks. This was where she truly belonged.[Chapter 2] To feel Flicka sail out beneath her again made Katy's heart soar. As they increased their speed Katy tilted her head back, feeling the warm sun on her face and neck. She heard Rob riding beside her laugh at his daughter's immense happiness. They reached the spot where their quarter horses were grazing, the exact spot where Flicka had run in and scattered them so long before. Katy thought of the fences that had recently begun construction, the ones that would separate the purebred quarter horses with the mustangs they intended to rescue. It had been Rob's idea to add Mustang Rescue to their business, though he had been very clear that it could not happen until they had built the fences. \"They're lookin' good Daddy,\" said Katy, her eyes sweeping over the strong, muscular horses. \"Don't I know it,\" said Rob, winking at Katy. \"You two look well.\" Katy knew they did. They had both recovered and were as strong as ever. Now, able to ride her tamed mustang once more, Katy felt free after the months of being house-bound. They headed back to the ranch. Though the ride had been short, Katy felt exhilarated, as if her life had meaning again. Rob told her that, since everything had gone well, Katy could take Flicka out by herself any time. But being a rancher wasn't all fun and games and, seeing as this was Katy's 'first day back', she was expected to work. There was more to do now that Howard was gone, but the others took no notice, used to the extra work load from when Katy wasn't there. After a morning of mucking out stalls, Katy was covered in dirt and hay, but she was still on a high from the morning's ride. She had been working extra fast so she could go for another ride in the afternoon and so far she was making good time. When Katy got to the house for lunch there was an unfamiliar car in the front yard. It looked expensive, but Katy didn't know what type of car it was. She didn't pay much attention to things with engines. She went inside and sitting at the table were Miranda and Rick Koop. \"Hey!\" said Katy, sliding into a chair opposite Miranda. Miranda smiled. \"Heard you took Flicka out this morning.\" \"It was great,\" said Katy. \"Is that your car in the front?\" Rick nodded animatedly. \"Yeah, it's pretty sleek isn't it?\" He began to talk about the engines and the features and Katy tuned out. It was no secret that the Koop's had money. But to buy a car when you could buy more horses, well, what was the point? Rob seemed to be ignoring Rick too, buttering a piece of bread and rolling his eyes as he rambled. Katy's mother Nell was nodding every now and then but anyone could see she wasn't interested. Except Rick. \"Dad,\" said Miranda. \"I don't think they want to hear every little detail about the car.\" Rick chuckled, shaking his head as if Miranda knew no idea. \"Alright, alright. So, how are you going with the Mustang Rescue?\" \"Still setting up, Rick,\" said Rob. \"Should be a good investment though. All you have to do is look at Flicka to see how successful it could be.\" \"I've been thinking about setting somethin' like that up myself,\" said Rick. Rob stared at him. \"You're kiddin'.\" Rick shook his head. \"No, I'm not. Like you said, it's a good investment.\" \"Dad, how come you never told me this?\" said Miranda, her eyes wide. \"You can't, you'll run the McLaughlin's out of business!\" \"I have no intention of doing that,\" said Rick. \"You've got more money than us, you'll get yours up and runnin' before us!\" said Rob. \"Everyone will identify yours as the first,\" said Nell. \"We'll just be followers.\" Rick shrugged. \"Can I help it if we've got money?\" \"Dad, don't!\" said Miranda. \"You can't just expect to march in here, telling us something like this and eat our food!\" \"Face it – we'll be more successful. But you still got the quarter horses, right?\" said Rick. \"You bastard!\" said Katy, standing up, her chair screeching. \"Katy!\" said Nell. \"You can't do this to Katy, after everything she's been through,\" said Rob. \"I can't help it if your little girl got sick,\" said Rick. \"Get outta my house,\" said Rob, pointing at the door. Rick rose and shrugged. \"Alright. C'mon Miranda.\" He went out. Miranda stood and looked around at the silent table. \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"I'll try and talk him out of it.\" She left. Katy was still standing, staring at the untouched lunch. Jack and Gus came in, the back door banging. \"Hey,\" said Jack. \"What'd we miss?\"[Chapter 3] Katy was the next to stand, shoving her chair back so it made a loud screeching sound on the floor. Jack and Gus watched wide-eyed, wondering what little drama they had stumbled upon this time. Whenever Katy was around there was always something the spirited girl was being passionate about. \"Katy,\" said Rob, not rising from his spot. \"Calm down. It'll be alright.\" \"Did you not hear him?\" shouted Katy. \"He's gonna ruin everything!\" Everything she and Flicka had worked for, everything Rob was now working for, all in vain. Because this man, this family Katy's considered as friends, were crushing their dreams. The walls Katy had built for herself were crashing down. It was times like these Katy wished more than anything that she had her brother around. Howard would be optimistic, even if there wasn't an immediate solution at hand. He would make her feel better about what seemed like a dire situation. Nell sighed and stood too, putting a comforting hand on her daughter's shoulder, but Katy shook it off. \"I'm going for a ride.\" \"Not too far Katy!\" called Rob, but she was already out the door. It was times like these when Katy needed to be alone, to clear her head. And riding was the best way to do that. She bridled Flicka and got up, not worrying about a saddle. She'd ridden thousands of time bareback, anyway. It was better than a saddle – she liked feeling the horse directly beneath her, the way she moved and sailed out beneath her when they galloped together, one person. There were times when Katy wasn't aware of where she ended and Flicka began. That's what she needed now. She was galloping before she reached the wide open fields. She had a feeling of recklessness stirring deep down, which she knew was dangerous and could get her into a lot of trouble. But she didn't often listen to her brain – she was a heart girl through and through. She galloped into the space she and her father had visited that very morning, where the quarter horses were grazing. Katy had the urge to scatter them, which she did. She doubted it would have much effect, seeing as fences were underway and the horses couldn't go anywhere, but she was wrong. A few of the horses tore away from the main herd and galloped, frightened, towards the fence construction. It was planned to be a sturdy fence, created for this sort of thing, but it wasn't ready yet. Katy could already see what was going to happen before it happened. The horses crashed through the weaker section, causing bits of wood and other materials to go flying. The quarter horses were still frightened of Flicka, still didn't accept her as one of their own. Katy was unsure of what to do. She began to panic. She couldn't ride after them because they would just continue to run because of Flicka. She had to ride home, get her father to help. She hated that. Katy believed she was capable of doing anything herself. Those months when she had been sick were the worst, because she was so completely helpless. She decided to chase them. Stupid, perhaps, but she could maybe herd them back into the fence boundaries without her father ever knowing. Of course there was the matter of the fence, but Katy could only deal with one thing at a time. The rest of the herd had followed the few that had crashed through the fence, and now they were galloping further towards the cliff that Flicka had once almost gone down. It wasn't dangerously close though, so Katy took chase. She went around the side and put pressure on the herd, getting closer until some of the horses gave shrieks and began turning. Katy smiled almost triumphantly – you just had to get a few to turn and the rest would follow. It took a while to get them back to where they were supposed to be, but finally they were there. Katy stopped by the fence, dismounted and got a piece of twine out of her jeans pocket, tying Flicka to the part of the fence that was still remaining. It was safer than just tethering Flicka with her reins because then if Flicka spooked, the twine would snap and she'd be free to bolt. If it were the reins, though, Flicka could do herself a serious injury. Katy inspected the fence. A whole section needed to be reworked, most certainly by her because no way was she inviting her father to inspect this thing. He'd never let her out riding alone again. Katy mounted up again, leaving the twine on the fence for later, and galloped Flicka towards the ranch. She took a different route back, not wanting to draw attention to herself. She planned to slip in, get fence supplies and slip back out so nobody would ever learn of her return and think she had just gone for a long, peaceful ride. Yet the different route consisted of the trees, bushes and shrubs where she'd almost been attacked by the mountain lion that one time, until Flicka had saved her. And Katy had a difficult time navigating quickly through it. Then a tree was directly in front of her, and Katy didn't have time to react with Flicka. The horse swerved around it but Katy didn't, and she came off, flying a few meters before hitting the ground and rolling, only stopping when she hit another tree to her left. She lay there for a few moments, assessing the damage. She was conscious, which was a plus. Her entire body ached but it didn't feel like anything was broken. She slowly sat up. The world spun a little before coming back into focus. But she ruled out concussion. She stretched out both arms, exercising her wrists. There was a sharp pain in her right one, but nothing she couldn't handle. She did the same with her legs, and discovered she had a very painful ankle sprain. As she stood, using the tree for support, she could barely put weight on her right foot. That was going to be hard to hide from her parents. She tried walking. She could disguise it if she could put up with the shooting pains. Besides, she'd had much worse. Flicka was grazing a few meters away, having stopped when she felt she no longer had a rider on her back. Now she looked to Katy as if asking her why she was taking so long. \"I'm comin',\" Katy muttered, limping over. She mounted by using a tree stump as a mounting block and managed to ride back without too much hassle, seeing as there were no stirrups to cause her any discomfort. She tethered Flicka behind the stables and crept in to the supply shed, though she made quite a bit of noise because her bad foot kept scuffing. How much wood would she need? How was she going to carry it? Katy supposed this was why most people thought things through before they did them. Maybe she should learn from those people. \"Whatcha doin'?\" Katy almost screamed, but instead just gasped and turned as fast a lightning bolt to see Gus in the doorway. \"Gus! You scared me.\" \"Sorry,\" he apologized. \"But what are you doin'?\" Katy considered lying, but thought better of it. \"I broke part of the new fence.\" Gus chuckled. \"Course you did.\" He pushed past Katy and began gathering up tools and materials. \"What're you doin'?\" said Katy, watching him. \"What does it look like? Helpin' you.\" He walked past with wood. \"I'll put it in the truck.\" Katy was touched by his readiness to help her, and decided not to argue against it because thinking about it, she really did need his help. She told him where the fence was and that she would meet him out there, then mounted Flicka and set off. Gus arrived shortly after Katy did, and she went to help him unload the truck. But he noticed her limping. \"You come off, did you?\" \"Yeah,\" admitted Katy sheepishly. \"Go sit down, I'll carry it over,\" Gus said. Katy went, because her ankle really was hurting. She didn't want to take off her boot and examine it though, because it would probably swell so she couldn't get the shoe back on. She'd probably have to sleep in it if she wanted to keep the injury from her parents. Oh well. It wouldn't be the first time. Once Gus had everything by the fence, he set to work, and Katy went to help him. They had barely picked up a thing when galloping hoof beats were heard. They turned at the same time and saw Rob and Jack. \"Aw, damn,\" said Gus, standing up. Katy just sat on the grass. Her father stopped and dismounted. Jack stayed on his horse. \"What the hell is goin' on here?\" said Rob, looking directly to Katy for answers. \"I'm sorry Daddy, it's my fault.\" \"I know it's your fault,\" said Rob. \"How'd this happen?\" \"The horses spooked,\" said Katy. \"Why?\" \"Because I scattered them.\" Jack let out a short laugh but was silenced by Katy's death stare. She didn't appreciate being made fun of, especially by Jack. But Rob didn't yell. He just sighed. \"Katy, I know what Miranda's dad said upset you. But we'll deal with it. We've got Miranda on our side.\" \"It won't make much difference,\" said Katy. Rob sat down next to Katy in the grass, something he rarely did. He looked odd, sitting cross-legged next to his teenage daughter by a broken fence. \"We'll convince him to stop.\" \"Dad, that's never gonna happen,\" said Katy, a smile on her lips. \"You, me and mom always get way too fired up.\" Rob laughed, but said: \"That's why I called Howard. He's got a break. Don't know what the hell for but he can come back. He'll negotiate. After all, he and Miranda were pretty hot 'n' heavy for a while!\" \"Dad, don't say that,\" said Katy. But she was overjoyed. \"So… Howard's coming back?\" \"Yup. He'll be here by tomorrow night.\" He stood up and grabbed Yankee's reins. \"You're welcome.\" Howard was coming home![Chapter 4] Hey everybody! I'm really sorry I haven't updated in, well, forever. It usually happens - I lose interest in a story and then pick it up again. Don't expect regular chapters because I'm deeply unreliable with that, haha. But I hope I can update every so often. This chapter is mostly about Katy and Howard which I know a lot of you like :) And I've started writing some stuff on FictionPress so check it out. \"Where the hell's my little sister?\" called Howard through the throngs of people standing around in the airport. He pushed through the crowd and spotted Katy and Rob, standing by the side. He chuckled to see them so separated from the other people. They were two of the same, both liking their space and their freedom, with no tolerance of the city life. Katy, who had heard Howard's shout, saw him and squealed, running forward. She flung herself at him, wrapping her arms around his neck and giggling hysterically. \"Jeez, what has my being gone done to ya?\" said Howard, who had dropped his carry-on bags to hold on to Katy. The truth was, he would be giggling hysterically too if his sister hadn't just knocked the wind out of him. Rob was slower to come forward, as was his style. He smiled at his son and whacked him on the back before bending forward to pick up the bags. \"Baggage claim?\" \"Not yet!\" said Katy. She gave her brother a final squeeze before letting go. \"I missed you!\" she said as Howard slung an arm around her shoulders. She looked him up and down, trying to see any injuries he didn't previously have. All she noticed, however, was his clothing. \"What are you wearin'?\" Howard looked down at his clothes. \"It's what normal people wear!\" he said defensively. \"Just coz you ranchers are living in the stone ages of fashion.\" \"Since when have you cared about fashion?\" said Rob, a smile on his face. Despite his uneasiness to share feelings regularly, it was evident he was overjoyed to have his son back. \"It's just what people wear,\" said Howard. \"I'm sure I'll get used to my country kicks again in no time.\" \"Kicks? What are kicks?\" said Katy. \"Shoes,\" said Howard. \"You know, kicks?\" At her bewildered glance he sighed. \"Okay, I don't know why they're called kicks. Maybe coz you kick with them? Shut up Katy,\" he added, because she was laughing at him. They collected his bags and headed out to the truck. Katy took the back seat, something she wasn't quite used to since Howard had left. She sighed and leaned back. Despite everything that was happening with Rick and Miranda, she was surprisingly content having Howard back. Her brother had that air about him – he was calming. It was like he could solve any problem. \"So how's college?\" asked Rob as they left the airport car park. \"Jesus, it's a madhouse in there,\" he added, glancing back in the rearview mirror. \"College is good. Good classes, interesting people. Hard sometimes,\" said Howard. \"Ah well, you need a bit of a challenge now that you've left the tough old ranch,\" said Rob jokingly. \"Hey Howard,\" said Katy, feeling somewhat left out sitting up the back. \"I know somebody who can't wait to see you.\" \"Oh yeah? Who?\" \"I hope you're kiddin'. Who do you think? Miranda .\" Howard seemed to tense a little bit. Only Katy noticed – Rob was watching the road. \"Uh, does she still… come around a lot?\" \"Yeah, why? Miranda's cool, we've been hanging out,\" said Katy, watching Howard closely. What was going one? Before Howard had left he'd been head over heels in love with Miranda, and now he was acting all uncomfortable about her. It was odd. \"You'll have to be the messenger,\" said Rob, grimacing. \"I doubt Rick will come by too often now that it's all out in the open. But I think he likes you. Miranda certainly does.\" \"It's an excuse to spend more time with your giiiirlfriieeend ,\" Katy said in a high-pitched, lovesick tone. Howard shifted and cleared his throat, something Katy knew Howard did when he was nervous or anxious or uncomfortable. The long drive home was spent chatting about easier subjects. It was dark by the time they reached the ranch. Nell was pacing on the porch and ran down the steps when the truck came to a halt. She grabbed Howard as he got out of the car and started kissing him all over his head. \"Baby, I missed you so much!\" \"Of course you did, it's me,\" said Howard, giving Katy a wink. They went inside, Rob lugging the bags. Jack and Gus greeted Howard from their positions on the couch in front of the television, too exhausted from the day's work to get up. \"Dinner'll be ready in about fifteen,\" said Nell. \"You can put your bags up first.\" Howard took over from Rob and dragged his bags upstairs. Katy followed like a puppy dog, eager to spend time with her brother after so long apart. \"So how's Flicka?\" he asked her once they'd gotten to his room. He collapsed onto the bed, spread-eagle. \"Wonderful. Beautiful,\" said Katy, sighing and sinking into the armchair in the corner. \"You should see us together.\" \"I have.\" Howard sat up and ran a hand through his hair. \"I noticed something downstairs.\" Katy looked at him. \"What?\" \"Did you see Jack?\" \"Jack?\" \"Yeah, Jack. You know, tall, dark hair, the kind of swoon-worthy good looks the city girls would kill for. That Jack.\" Katy watched him apprehensively. \"Yeah I saw him. Why?\" \"Did you see him see you?\" Howard asked, his eyebrows raised. \"Okay, what is this? Either tell me what you're getting at or don't,\" said Katy, impatient as always. \"I think he likes you.\" Katy snorted. \"Right! Jack likes me. Uh huh. Next thing you'll say Gus likes me.\" Then, thinking back to when Gus had called Katy a \"flicka\", a young, pretty girl, Katy put up a hand to stop Howard from saying it – his mouth was already open to form the words. \"Don't go there!\" Howard rolled his eyes and lay back down on the bed. \"I'm just sayin'. He was looking at you differently. I'd say you're too blind to notice. And Gus may have thought you were pretty but it wasn't like that. He's too old for you anyway.\" \"Oh, and Jack isn't?\" said Katy. \"Jack's younger than Gus,\" said Howard. Katy sighed. \"Shut up Howard. And anyway, speaking of love! What's with you? You tensed up when I mentioned Miranda in the car.\" Howard shot up. \"I did not!\" \"Yeah, you did.\" Katy watched him squirm under the pressure of her gaze. \"Well?\" Howard sighed and looked to his hands. \"So I might have started seeing a girl in the city.\" \" What! \" \"Hey, don't shout!\" said Howard. \"And don't judge.\" \"I wasn't judgin'.\" \"I can hear you in your mind,\" said Howard. \"What's the problem?\" Katy leaned forward, counting on her fingers. \"Well let's see. You two are perfect together, you both think the same way, you're both from the same background. I mean, you get each other. You both totally love each other.\" Howard frowned at Katy. \"You seem to know a lot about a relationship that isn't even yours.\" \"I thought you were gonna give long distance a try!\" said Katy. \"It's hard Katy. I'm so busy, she's so busy. It's hard to get a chance to web chat or IM or email. Beth, she was just there.\" \"Beth? Her names Beth? Uh, I bet she's a total slutty city girl,\" said Katy. She felt betrayed, not that she really understood why. It wasn't like Howard's relationships were any of her business. She supposed it was because Howard had never told her on the phone or online. He had never mentioned anybody called Beth. Sure, he'd mentioned his \"wild\" friend Colin and the gay guy Artie who had hit on him (Katy had laughed about it for a long time), but never Beth. Not even a friend Beth, and now there was a girlfriend Beth. \"Hey, don't,\" said Howard. \"Have you told Miranda? Because last time I saw her it didn't seem like she had the slightest clue,\" said Katy. \"Uh, no…\" said Howard. \"Howard! That's basically cheating.\" \"It's not cheating! Miranda and I have barely spoken since I went away. I'd hardly call that a relationship.\" Katy glared at him and stood. \"I'm going to go see if dinner's ready.\" Howard sighed and rubbed his forehead with his hand. \"Katy, come on. What's wrong?\" \"Nothing!\" She stomped downstairs. But deep down she knew what was wrong. It wasn't like Katy made friends so easily. She was a headstrong girl and most people couldn't handle her spirit or her tough determination. But thanks to Howard's relationship, Miranda had become quite a close friend to Katy. What happened if or when Howard and Miranda broke up? Miranda would probably never come around to the ranch again. She would probably blame all of the McLaughlin's for the break up, even Katy. Or she wouldn't, but it would be too difficult to come to Howard's home, despite Howard never being there. Katy hated to admit she was like any other teenager, but the truth was she was. She needed social stimulation as much as the next person. Not that she'd ever admit that to Howard. I hope you liked it. More soon hopefully. Like I said, I'm not exactly reliable. Plus I just entered Year Eleven and the homework load is unbelievable. Comments accepted :) ","Summary":" The recovery progress had been a long one. Katy McLaughlin had been desperate to ride Flicka ever s"},{"Movie":"Flicka","Title":"Flicka 2","Author":"Yes.I'm.A.Fangirl","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11886644","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 Katy buttoned up her western flannel black plaid shirt and reached down to grab her boots from the corner of her small, comfy room. Then she left. Tiptoeing out of her room and down the wooden stairs. She stopped to look at her favorite painting. She put her fingers on the corner, like she always did. That spot and only that spot had dirt fingerprints from years of admiring. Her smile shone in the dark room before she quickly and quietly continued down the stairs. Across the living room and to the door she went. Only a few seconds were wasted, making sure the door wouldn't slam shut and alert her family to her early morning adventure. Memories of sneaking down in this exact pattern swirled in her mind. When she was little, when she had ridden out on Yankee, and when she had sneaked out every night to train Flicka. This time was different. She would go see Flicka but she would be free. She was healed. Almost a month ago, Katy had ridden in a wild mustang race with Flicka. She had lost hope of her father letting her keep Flicka and had ridden away in hope of setting her free. A storm blew in and soaked them both, making Katy dangerously cold. Flicka had been attacked by a cougar after she threw Katy. When Katy refused to leave her, she wrapped her sweater around her horse's neck, trying to stop the bleeding. She only left when she was hypothermic, but she didn't leave on her own, her father had found her in the storm and took her home, leaving the injured Flicka behind. Katy had gotten a fever that was terrifyingly high. Over and over, she would mumble \"Flicka!\" as she tossed and turned. Her father was going to leave to kill the horse but one thing stuck clearly in Katy's mind. She had somehow gotten past her mother unknowingly and walked to the top of the stairs where she looked down at her father, her brother, and his two ranch hands. \"It's okay daddy. You can shoot us .\" She had said. At that time, her mother had found her and dragged her back to bed. A gun shot sounded and Katy thought her mustang, her other self, had left her forever. But it had been the cougar her dad had shot. He led Flicka back and had let Katy's mother help him get Flicka healed. Only when Katy was well enough to be out of bed, did he call her outside to see her horse. Flicka was alive. Katy had goose-flesh on her arms as she remembered the horrifying night. The feeling of the cold, seeping into her bones, seeing her horse bleeding in front of her, her hands sore from throwing rocks at the cougar, feeling hopeless. She shook her head, her curly brown hair bouncing. That was over . Not Flicka was waiting in the barn for her, ready to run. It would still be a couple of hours before the sun made it's appearance above the mountains, turning the sky into a parade of colors. A creak sounded as she tossed her weight into the barn doors and hoisted them open. She stepped inside as she had the first day she had seen Flicka. But this time she didn't have to ask who wanted to go running. She had Flicka. Katy ran to her stall and threw it open, throwing her arms around her beautiful mare. Flicka, pretty girl. She grabbed a hackamore off a hook next to the door of the stall and slipped it over Flicka's velvety nose. Flicka let out a quiet squeal-like huff of air onto Katy's face. Her laugh erupted the silence of the barn that was only filled with the sounds of shifting horses. This was taking too long. Forget the saddle! She led Flicka out of her stall before vaulting onto her smooth, shiny back. \"Let's go runnin'\" She leaned forward and smooched. Flicka didn't need telling. She was off! Katy tried to slow her down only a little bit to a canter so she could at least not hurt herself from not warming up correctly. Flicka tossed her pretty head and blew a whistle into the fresh morning mountain air. Only a minute later, Katy was ready to go. She leaned forward against the wind and gave Flicka her rein. Then they ran. Trees, rocks, and everything else whipped by as if she were flying a thousand miles an hour. Her hair blew back into the air, wind lashing at her face. She laughed and took a deep breath, taking her hands off the reins and spreading them out into the air, straightening her back and throwing her head back in pure joy. She screamed into the air of the morning, disrupting a bird from it's nest, sending it flying into the dawning sky. Streaks of orange burst into streaks across the sky, the stars slowly disappearing, winking goodbye. Flicka slowed to a swinging lope, ears pricked forward. A thin layer of sweat had surfaced on her chest from her surging gallop across the mountain valley. Katy let out a yelling whoop before regretfully turning Flicka around to head home. Flicka didn't want to go either but she listened, breathing out a heavy sigh. Part of Katy wished she could go back to the wild while the other half wanted her to stay with her forever. They glided across the valley, the sun growing uncomfortably high in the sky. She would be in trouble. If her father realized she had snuck out again, she would never be able to step foot out of the house again. She wasn't even supposed to be riding yet. At least her father thought not. The doctor had given the approval weeks ago but her father had taken it upon himself to deprive her from the right of riding free. She reached the ranch only a little later after the sun had made it's glorious arrival. No doubt her father was up but maybe, just maybe, he hadn't notice Flicka and Katy were gone. She slid off Flicka's back and grabbed the reins, walking towards the barn. She wished desperately her father hadn't noticed her absence. Too late. He stood with his arms crossed, leaning of Flicka's stall, awaiting her arrival. His cowboy hat was pulled low over his face, hiding his expression. She could imagine it wasn't good. She only was able to hide half her cringe. \"You left.\" He lifted his head to her. \"Daddy, I haven't ridden in forever and I couldn't wait for your okay.\" She shifted nervously on her feet, Flicka nuzzling her back. \"You disobeyed my rules.\" He was terrifying. Only speaking in small sentences. It was enough to make anyone want to tear away. It only made her annoyed. Why wouldn't he talk. Though she knew better, sometimes cowboys just didn't talk. \"I had to. I could stay in that house any longer without going into insanity!\" She placed her hand protectively on Flicka's neck. Flicka sighed and leaned into her touch. Her father, Rob, stayed still for over a minute. Heart pounding, Katy stared back stubbornly at her father. They were alike in that way. Stubborn and hard to control, if controllable at all. Finally, her father nodded. Katy did a double take. Was her father broken? Did he just nod and except it! \"Go get cleaned up, momma's makin' breakfast,\" He paused on his walk out of the barn, \"Try to come without another cougar story this time.\" She stood, mouth agape as she watched her father walk out of the barn. What. Just. Happened. Since when did her father listen to her? Since when did she not get punished after a stunt like that! Maybe her father thought she could take care of herself now. She stood proudly as she settle on that thought and let Flicka wander into her stall, waiting for what work the day had in store for her. Katy was sitting down at the table, leaning back in her chair to wait for everyone to come in. Her mother hummed in the kitchen and piled food onto plates. Finally her father came in the front door. He removed his hat and placed it on the table considering Katy. She pretended not to notice and acted like she was completely interested in a bird that landed outside the window. Her father heaved a sigh as he settled down into his chair, leaning into the back as if he had just done a days worth of chores. Gus, her father's friend and ranch hand, stomped into the room with his cowboy boots and sat down in his chair across from her. He didn't look half as tired as her father. Then the next person came into the kitchen looking like he hadn't slept in days. At least, that's what he acted like. Jack, the wannabe mature 20 year old ranch hand, stumbled in and threw himself at him chair next to Gus. Previously his brother's friend, before he moved to go to college, Jack put his hat over his face as if he was going to take a nap right in his char. Gus punched the hat off his face. \"This guy needs to grow up and fight morning like a man.\" Gus said to no body, hoping to alert Jack to wake him up. Jack grunted and picked his hat up off the ground. Katy looked down at the table, avoiding the gaze of her father, who was still standing one spot away from her. As if on cue, her mother bustled into the kitchen with plates of food. Jack sat up straight in his seat and grumbled hungrily before Gus elbowed him in his side. Hard. \"And here from your very own Goose Creek Ranch, hotcakes and sausage. Enjoy\" She pushed Rob into his seat before settling into her own, acting as a barrier between her and her father. Jack piled his plate full of food and began stuffing it in his face like there was no tomorrow. Gus looked in disgust at him before taking only a little food. It was weird hoe different yet alike they were. Gus acted mature. Jack didn't, though he tried. Gus tried to be careful and limit his needs before everyone else. Jack just took what he wanted and asked questions later. Yet they were alike in so many ways. They were both skilled horsemen, respected by her father, hard workers, and kind. Well, most of the time anyway. \"Ugh! Jack, chew your food!\" Katy looked at him, disgusted. He looked up from his plate, cheeks puffed out like a chipmunk. He stared at her, chewing. He glared at her at if daring her to criticize him again. Only having one pancake, she stood up and went into the kitchen, pretending to get herself some water. What she was really doing was getting away from Jack before he completely ruined her appetite. She took as long as she could before walking back to the table and settling herself into her seat. The empty chair next to hers just reminded her that Howard, her brother, was gone. There was a tingling in her nose and a stinging sensation in her eyes and she stood up and launched herself up the stairs, skipping steps and ignoring her father's calls. She sat down on her bed and held her head in her hands, taking deep breaths. She knew she could stop herself from crying but she didn't want to be around anyone else so they could see her struggle not to. A second later, her mother, Nell, came up the stairs and leaned on her door frame. She knew all too well what had happened. Katy could hear the questioning sounds from the table, the stairs being right outside her room, which were almost directly next to the table. Her mother sat next to her on her bed and sighed, thinking the same thing. Howard was gone.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Katy stayed in her room with her mother comforting her, rocking back and forth. Almost an hour later, they both got up. Mom said she had to start her chores and left, only after hinting that she too should start. \"Well, no use sittin' in here all day\" She ran her fingers through her hair, pushing it out of her face. She left the confined comfort of her room and walked down the stairs. Her father was talking with Jack as they sat on the couch. She descended down the stairs, stopping to place her fingers on the wild horse painting. Watching them run across the field, directly at her, almost hearing the sounds of hoof beats trampling the ground. Both her father and Jack got up from the couch as she hopped down the stairs. Then she paused. They both were staring at her. Well, her dad was. Jack was staring at him, looking as if he was waiting for instructions. Katy had seen this coming though, she sighed and leaned on the stair railing. \"Get Flicka and go down to the west fence to help him an' Gus fix it up.\" He nodded towards Jack, who nodded his head towards Katy and walked out the door. Katy hurried up after him, not giving her father so much as a glance. She knew what he was actually doing. He was giving her a babysitter. Yay. She rolled her eyes as she turned away from her father and slid on her boots before following Jack. His long strides were hard to keep up with. She ran to catch up with him before settling into a fast walk beside him, sometimes having to jog to keep up. For some reason, Jack seemed to take pleasure in this. Like he took joy in being four years older than her and being trusted with the responsibility of being her babysitter. She silently made a promise to him that she would make his new job the most difficult it had ever been. Once he had let her work with Flicka, knowing that her father had banned it. After she had gotten sick, that had changed. She wondered if her father had found out. Then he hadn't helped her anymore with Flicka. He had once gotten her caught when she was going to sneak out to ride like she just had this morning. That aught to teach him, she couldn't be controlled. This was starting to get ridiculous. Jack had sped up his walking so now she had to jog most of the time to keep up. She tossed around the idea of just letting him stroll off without her but she wouldn't give up. The barn seemed to be moving farther away, not closer. Nope. She was done. She sprinted ahead of Jack into the barn. She glanced behind her to see Jack scowling. Ha ha! Flicka nuzzled Katy's cheek, whiskers tickling her. Jack stepped into the stall next to her, getting the horse he preferred, Champ. Pure quarter horse. Blood bay with a shiny yet dusty looking coat. Yet the gelding was nothing like Flicka. Her black, soft, beautiful coat. Her wild brown eyes. Her elegantly curved neck. Her strong yet thin legs. But most of all, her wild spirit, matching perfectly with Katy's. Jack led Champ out of his stall so he could start tacking him up. Katy took her time, grabbing a brush and entering the stall, trusting Flicka not to move. Flicka leaned into the brush as Katy stroked her coat, even though it wasn't dirty. She heard a grunt behind her and turned to see Jack staring at her, a saddle in his arms. She gave a faint apology in her smile as she moved out of Flicka's stall her grab her saddle. Flicka followed Katy out of her stall. When Flicka saw the saddle, she didn't even flinch. Katy had the strong urge to just throw her arms around Flicka and hug her for the rest of eternity. But she couldn't. The fence needed fixing and if she wasn't on Flicka soon, Jack would probably just lasso her and drag her there himself. Katy flung the saddle over Flicka's back and positioned it. After tightening the cinch securely, she buckled the breast collar around Flicka's chest, holding the saddle in place if she were to climb up hill or simply if the saddle just started to slip back. The hackamore was the last thing. Flicka dipped her nose into it and almost put it on herself. Jack was already sitting upon Champ, who threw his big head and pawed the dirt. Katy wished she could take her time, just to annoy Jack some more but she thought better of it. She still had to do the rest of her chores. She placed her foot into the stirrup and swung her leg over the saddle. Jack was already out the door by the time she could put her hands on the reins. She followed, wishing she could gallop away. Once again, she couldn't. First of all, that would risk injury for Flicka and second, dad wouldn't let her out of his sight. Or he would just make Jack and Gus both have to be with her at all times. Katy's hands tingled, like she wanted to punch something. Maybe she would just take it out on the wood they would be nailing into place. They both rode in silence at a fast walk for the first few minutes. Flicka tossed her head and did half rears as they went along. Katy felt the same. If Jack didn't let them run soon, she would turn around and go on a ride of her own. Or just run ahead. She waited impatiently, tapping her fingers on the saddle horn. She felt weird. It was at that moment when she realized it. She didn't have her hat. She touched her head, and remembered she had left it on it's hook. She settled back into her anxious wait. Flicka sensed her annoyance and hopped around, prancing here, half rearing there. Katy wasn't annoyed with Flicka as she might have been if she were on a different horse. Maybe it was because they were the same. They both felt the same things. She waited for Jack to let Champ run. Too late! \"Run like the wind pretty girl\" She whispered. Flicka's ears shifted back towards her to catch her voice. Katy gave her a little touch of her heels and Flicka ran. She ran as if she were completely free. In less than a second, they passed Jack. He shouted after her before letting Champ run after her. Flicka was outrunning them both. Her flying legs were faster than Champs. Power surged through her and she somehow ran faster. Katy screamed in joy, only making Flicka give a tiny flying leap before running flat out, belly skimming the ground. Her ears were tilted back as she concentrated on running. Katy laughed, adrenaline rushing through her veins. Her heart almost broke when she saw Gus just ahead. She sighed deeply, which made Flicka slow down her running just a bit. She pulled back on the reins and sat heavy in her seat. Flicka pulled her haunches beneath her and slid to a stop. Gus glanced over at her and looked around her. A smile lit up his face and he laughed. She too looked back. Jack had only just appeared over the hill she had crossed what seemed like ages ago. Flicka was still full of spirit, wanting to run again. She took the hint that she couldn't and lowered her head when Katy threw herself from the saddle. Jack wheeled a huffing Champ to a stop and gave Katy a fierce glare. He too threw himself from the saddle and stomped over to the truck, wood piled in the back. Gus, still unable to control his laughter, clapped Jack on the back, bending over in another wheezing fit of uncontrollable laughter. Jack yanked some thick leather gloved from his back pocket and pulled them on. Oops. There was another thing she forgot. First the hat and now to gloves. This was really an off day for her. She eyed the posts that were dug into the ground. It was a long line of posts, needing wood stretched between them. Maybe she wouldn't have to do the rest of her chores today. This looked like it could take... a while. Her chest heaved a sigh before she set to work. Grabbing a wooden board from the back of the truck, she pulled it to the fence. Gus tossed her a hammer, she almost missed it, which would have made it strike her face. Next her tossed her a box of old nails, reused and reused. She lifted the wood with her ungloved hands and fit it on the space of the two posts. She took the hammer and a nail and started pounding it into the wood. She continued that for over two hours. Wood. Lift. Nail. Wood. Lift. Nail. Wood. Lift. Nail. A thick piece of wood entered her finger. She grunted in pain and closed her mouth to muffle her groan of pain. She brought her finger to her mouth and yanked out the thick sliver with her teeth. She bit her lip and clenched her jaw, the pain starting to ebb away. \"Hey Katy.\" She looked over at Jack. He removed his gloves from him calloused hands and tossed them to her. She nodded her thank and slipped them over her hands. It was really hot out today. Her hair blocked the wind from cooling her down. She stumbled over to Flicka and grabbed a canteen full of water. She gulped some down and placed it back on her saddle. She frowned as she realized Flicka must be hot too. She started to remove the saddle from her back. A thin layer of sweat had formed from the saddle. She whispered how sorry she was to Flicka and was about to get back to work when she looked at her saddle again. Leather straps. She touched one. It was thin an flexible, almost like a piece of fabric. She untied it from the hook and used it to tie her hair up. Heaven . The gentle breeze helped her cool down. She wished she could just stand there for the rest of the day. She lugged herself back to work, sleep pulling at her eyelids. Maybe she shouldn't have gone out so early this morning. She shook her head and went back to work. Wood. Lift. Nail. Wood. Lift. Nail. She stepped back to the truck, going to get another board. Maybe she could just sit down and close her eyes for a second. She sat down in the shade of the truck and leaned her head against the tires. She felt the grass, tickling her elbows. Work of the ranch was tiring. Not to mention, having to wake up extra early just to be able to get a good ride in. A little rest couldn't hurt. Jut for a few minutes anyway. She closed her eyes and relaxed. Just a few minutes.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Katy woke up when her head hit something hard. She lifted her head a little bit just to have it hit the same thing again. Then she realized she was moving. Her head whipped up and her eyes shot open. She was in the back of a moving truck. She panicked and shook her head around until she saw Flicka, following the truck at a brisk trot. Her saddle was in the truck bed next to her. She calmed down a little bit, if she needed to escape, Flicka was here. But she didn't need to. The truck bed had small or broken pieces of wood in it. The sky was still bright but it was cooler, the sun heading across the sky. It was probably around six. She turned around and peered into the truck. Gus was tapping his fingers on the steering wheel, listening to country music. Luckily, Jack wasn't there. She didn't want him of all people so see her sleep. Nope. Never. She sat up from her leaning position and cracked her neck. Flicka nickered a greeting and tossed her head, playing behind the truck. Katy looked around, a few minutes drive from being home. She dusted the dirt from the back of her jeans as she kneeled over the side of the truck, crooning to Flicka. Flicka tossed her head and cantered up to the side of the truck. As Flicka ran alongside the truck, Katy stroked her neck. She wanted to jump off the truck and onto Flicka's back but it seemed to her that Flicka had worked enough today. The truck bumped up to the barn and parked just outside of it. Katy grabbed her saddle and slid off the end of the truck's bed. Gus didn't even glance at her as he walked into the barn. Katy looked at Flicka, eyebrows raised. \"Oops, probably made him work more than he aught to.\" Flicka snorted and flicked her ears forward. Katy carried her tack into the barn and placed it on it's rack. Flicka had followed her in and had wondered into her stall, dipping her head to drink the cool water. Katy sighed and closed the stall door behind her beautiful mare. \"I'll be back later Flicka.\" She tapped her hand on the wood before jogging out of the barn. Katy sped through her chores, dodging out of the way from Gus, Jack, and her father, just in case he already knew about her little nap. She hoped he didn't. Though it was probably too much to wish for, she wished he never knew. Maybe, just maybe, Jack and Gus wouldn't tell him. But that was close to impossible. Especially with Jack's big mouth he had gained, even more, after the cougar. She stepped foot in the house tenderly, waiting to see if she would be yelled at. When no comment came, she slipped off her boots and threw herself onto the couch for the \"evening meet-up\" they sometimes had. Tonight was one of those nights. Being the first one there, she claimed the couch. She spread herself over it, taking up all the room. Her mother came in the door from her garden work only a second later and splayed herself across the leather chair in the living room across from the couch at a left angle. Next Gus came in, seating himself in one of the few remaining chairs, next to the couch. Her father was next in and took the last of the single chairs. Katy frowned. She didn't look at anyone and kept herself stretched out on the sofa. Jack stomped his boots outside the door before swinging it open, the screen door squeaking. He stood in the living room, his hands on his hips as he stared directly at Katy. Then to the sofa she was hiding beneath her. She closed her eyes. Maybe he would just leave. She wanted the couch. It had accepted her. Nope. Jack strutted over to the sofa, everyone else ignoring him and talking in their own conversation. Jack looked expectantly at her. She didn't move. Go away. She repeated in her head. Go sit on the floor or something. He just stared at her. She still didn't move. She couldn't do much else to stop him from sitting down. He reached out one hand and brushed her legs aside, making her spin around from the force that seemed to be too easy for him. Katy glared at the floor and crossed her arms. Finally, after what seemed like ages, even though it was only about a minute later, the three \"adults\" finished their side conversation. They all turned into a more inviting angle which would allow the two couch loungers to speak freely. Katy didn't want to talk. She didn't even glance up from her stare at the floor when her father started talking. \"How does the fence look?\" He made a sound that suggested he had moved his chair around. \"Looks good.\" Gus said after a few seconds of waiting for Jack or herself to speak. It seemed like Jack was playing the \"quiet game\" right along with her. This made her more angry. She tapped her foot of the floor and tightened her grip around her knee. She was just waiting for someone to tell her father that she had fallen asleep when she was supposed to be working. That time didn't come. The rest of the small amount of time, both Jack and Katy kept quiet. The amount of time for their \"meeting\" was almost over when her father singled her out. \"Katy, tomorrow take Luna to patrol the fence. It seems that Flicka has had a lot of extra work today and needs her rest.\" Katy was about to smile and leave when he kept talking and made it worse, \"Jack, go with her.\" Fury. That was all she felt for that moment. She didn't need a babysitter. She could take care of herself! How could she feel like she could be trusted if she wasn't being treated like it. Okay, she hadn't really been trustworthy recently but that was only because of her father's stubbornness. And her own. A wave of her mother's hand dismissed everyone. As the ranch workers dispersed, Katy stomped her way up to her room and closed the door behind her. Though sleep pulled at her eyes, she didn't go to bed just then. For the next hour, her stubborn nature kept her awake, staring out the window. Only late in the night did she leave her post to go to sleep. Wrapped up in her blankets, she huffed. Not only was she going to have a babysitter, she had to ride Luna instead of Flicka on a full days ride. She puffed her annoyance before settling into a calm sleep.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Katy woke at the break of dawn at the sound of feet thumping down the stairs next to her door. First there were heavy thuds then soft patters as her father led the way down the stairs, followed by her mother. Grudgingly, she ripped the blankets off of herself to welcome the stinging cold of the morning air. It was warm outside but the air was still much colder than her soft, warm blankets. After putting on a pair of blue jeans and red flannel shirt, she grabbed her socks and padded out of her room. Faint gravel crunches outside told her that her father had already left to go start feeding the horses. She wiped the sleep from her eyes and sat down on the stairs, pulling on her gray socks. She stood back up and slid down the railing on the wall until she got to the painting. There she placed two fingers on it and smiled, seeming to wake up like someone had just poured water on her. She did a half spin on her heels before skipping down the rest of the stairs. Her mother's faint humming sounded from the kitchen. A lullaby toon that she had once used to calm Flicka. Hush-a-by, don't you cry. Go to sleepy little baby. When you wake, you shall have, all the pretty little ponies. Blacks and bays, dapples and grays... The song would continue on. She couldn't remember all of the words so she made them up in her head as she went. Though, she didn't sing, or hum. She decided not to go to the kitchen and followed the crunching gravel outside. By the door, she slipped on her boots and made sure to grab her hat from the hook. She stuffed it on her head and jogged out to the barn. She was hungry but she needed to feed the stalled horses first. Instead of going directly into the barn, she grabbed a hay bale from a stack just outside of the door. She lifted it up and walked, her hands hurting from the twine and poking straws of hay. As she walked into the barn, the horses perked their ears as they smelled the alfalfa. Flicka turned in her stall, not even glancing at the hay bale, and half reared to Katy. \"Not today girl. Tomorrow I'll be back for you. We will run like the wind. Forever free.\" She stopped by her stall and stroked her hand down Flicka's velvety muzzle. She grabbed two sharp rocks from a small pile and slammed them together over the twine, making it break. She grabbed two sections, called flakes, of the hay bale and threw them into the stall with Flicka. She made her way down the isle, throwing flakes in for the horses then retreating to go grab another small bale. When all the horses had their alfalfa, she walked out of the barn, her shirt covered in stray pieces of the dried grass. Her father had gotten the tractor and was taking a large bale towards the penned horses. She spun around as she heard ropes hitting the ground. Gus had just thrown out a lasso and was rolling it into neat coils to be used for stray, stubborn horses. Or wild ones for that matter. She looked back at her father's tractor and looked just in time to see him lower the bale into the feeding ring. She looked toward the chicken coop for her next chore and saw Jack was already over there, unloading bags of chicken food. She was going to wait for him to leave but her stomach growled, reminding her that breakfast would be served when she was done. She turned towards the house and ran up to the porch, grabbing a basket that was hanging on the side of the white bench. She was hoping that by the time she grabbed it, Jack would be gone. He wasn't. Grudgingly, she walked over to the coop. Luckily, Jack ignored her presence. She grabbed a scoop of chicken feed from a plastic bin and walked into the chicken coop through the screen lockable door. She spread out the chicken feed throughout the coop while piling eggs into her basket. By the time she was done, the basket was almost overflowing with fragile eggs. The chickens clucked loudly at her as she trampled small amounts of their feed while trying to escape through the door. Luckily, no chickens got out and she walked briskly towards the house. Jack, who had finished unloading the feed as soon as she finished, followed her. Everyone who was just working, stampeded towards the house. Her mother's scrumptious cooking was wafting into the living room as everyone came inside, clawing their way towards the table. Today, no one looked nearly as tired as they were the day before. Katy dug into her scrambled eggs and bacon, eating ravenously. Everyone else copied her, all except for her mother. She seemed to have eaten while cooking and sat back in her chair, lost in thought. When everyone had had their fill, everyone got up. All except her mother, who was still not paying attention. There had been no talk at the table this morning. Not that it was unusual, they usually only talked at dinner. Her father didn't bother her, instead he talked to her and Jack. \"You two, ride around all of the fences and scout which ones need fixing. Katy, take Luna. Jack, take your choice of horse, besides Champ,\" Jack breathed out, obviously he had wanted to take Champ again today, \"Wait for Nell to grab you two some lunch before heading out. Oh, and don't loose each other.\" He stared at Jack when he said the last part. Jack nodded. Katy wouldn't have been surprised if he saluted. Of course, she knew why her father had said not to loose each other. He didn't want her to be alone. He didn't want her to get hurt. He was being just a little bit overprotective. And she hated it. The sound of a chair scrapping against the floor captured all of their attention. Her mother had just gotten up and flew into the kitchen. She threw a saddle bag to Jack, who only struggled for a second before catching it. \"Lunch. Be home in time for dinner now.\" She turned back to the kitchen and vanished. When Katy turned towards her father, she found he wasn't there anymore. He walked out the door. Jack nodded his head, motioning for her to follow. She didn't want to but there wasn't another way to exit the house. So she followed. They walked towards the barn while Gus and her father went to opposite direction, towards the water pump. It must have broke because they took tools with them. Jack only glanced at them before quickly looking back to make sure she had followed and speeding up. Katy didn't even try keeping pace with him. She lagged behind, walking fast but still lagging, which resulted in her getting to the barn when Jack was already slipping a halter on a horse. He had chosen, Copper, a chestnut, very tall, well-bred, gelding Quarter horse. Katy watched as he led Copper out of his stall and left to grab his saddle. Flicka pressed herself against her stall door, reaching her head out to it's limits to touch Katy. \"I'm so sorry pretty girl. I have to ride someone else. Father's orders.\" She kissed Flicka's muzzle before slowly moving away. Only three stalls down, she stopped at Luna's stall. Lunar Eclipse was a red roan mare, only just tall enough to be classified as a horse. No wonder her father wanted her to ride Luna, she was tiny! If she fell, she wouldn't be hurt. Not only was Luna small, she was slow, stubborn, and barn sour. Not the best example of the ranch's horses. Katy looked longingly at Flicka, who's expression look offended. Jack gave her a stern look, which looked funny on his face. She took the hint and led Luna out of her stall. She wished she could have ridden a different horse. She left to get the saddle anyway. When she tightened the cinch, it barely fit. Luna was round from not being used. Maybe her father would just sell her for some extra money. After all, her father always said \"Either they bring in money or help keep it if they stay on this ranch.\" Why couldn't he follow his own rule for this cranky mare. Every horse either helped on the ranch as work horses, were sold, or were used for breeding. Simple! This horse did nothing! After having a lot of trouble with the hackamore, Katy led the mare out of the barn very slowly, seeing she refused to leave. She looked accusingly at Jack. He was laughing at her. \"And what is so funny\" she growled. \"That you have to ride that !\" He was sitting upon his high horse, motioning towards Luna. Katy mumbled under her breath and swung herself onto Luna's back. She almost fell over her other side. Instead of her horse, throwing her head and prancing in place, Luna lowered her head and closed her eyes to sleep. \"I'm going to kill you dad!\" She quietly promised. Jack turned Copper and walked off, turning around in his saddle to watch her. First, Katy tried to loosen the reins and click to Luna. When that didn't work, she nudged her with her heels. When even that didn't work, she tried a little harder. She didn't want to hurt the horse so she took her hand and slapped it on Luna's hindquarters. The mare moved off slowly. Jack slowed down his horse until they were side by side. \"Excellent horsemanship\" He laughed. \"Bull\" She kept looking ahead. If she wanted to, she could reach out and touch Copper's side. He was so tall while Luna was this tiny little fuss. She had never disliked a horse ever. She didn't dislike Luna but that didn't mean she would ride her. Her color was good. That's it. Jack continued on talking. \"Oh, your father is now my favorite person ever!\" He reached down, flattening himself to the saddle, and touched Luna's head. \"Shut up.\" \"I mean, how is that a horse!\" \"Shut your face.\" \"The saddle is half her size!\" \"Shut your pie hole.\" \"And you look tall for once!\" \"Leave me alone.\" \"Well, you see, I can't do that. I am on specific orders to not let you out of my sight. You can no longer be trusted but I can. And on that horse, you ain't going nowhere.\" \"Like you can or should be trusted.\" \"Well, I can. Proof of that is your father asking me to watch you.\" \"I don't need a babysitter.\" Katy was starting to get annoyed, not even to their first fence yet and she already wanted to strangle someone. \"But now you got one.\" \"Bug off\" \"Sorry, not a bug.\" Katy stayed silent, frowning as she kept her eyes forward. Jack continued talking before giving up when she didn't say anything back. So instead of talking her ear off, he did something that made her more angry. He moved Copper into a trot. He turned around in his saddle and smirked. She tried to get Luna to go faster. After a minute or two, when Jack was a long ways in front of her, Katy finally got her into a slow trot. It was so slow! She needed Flicka back. Then she could just run away from Jack and never look back. As she daydreamed about running away from the annoying cowboy, she didn't notice that Luna had begun to turn slowly around. She only snapped out of it when Luna actually started moving. Katy quickly grabbed her reins and pulled them tight. When Luna didn't slow, she took one rein and pulled it to her side, forcing Luna to turn her head and circle. When Luna finally became dizzy, Katy stopped her facing away from home. Luna braced her legs and huffed. Jack was cantering towards her. Oh great. \"What happened there?\" \"Turned towards home\" \"Well, I know that! Why did you let her?\" \"I didn't! I just wasn't paying attention.\" She mumbled the last part. \"Were you too lost in my expert riding skills.\" \"Nope.\" She didn't want to say anything but if she stopped talking at that moment, he would have won. \"Yes you were.\" \"Nope. For your information I was thinking about how nice it would be to run away from your annoying big mouth.\" \"Like Cinderella? Am I your prince charming?\" \"No!\" Jack frowned. Katy nudged Luna with her heels. Luna didn't move but she leaned forward like she was thinking about it. Again she nudged her forward. Luna only swayed forward. Then again. One step. Then another. Two steps. Then another. Two steps and a sway. Another. Success! \"Haha! Now my skills are impressive aren't they!\" She taunted. \"No. Not really.\" He sounded disappointed that he didn't get to see her struggle as much anymore. \"Yes they are. You know it.\" \"Nope.\" \"Um, yes they are.\" \"Not at all.\" \"Lets trade horses then.\" She suggested putting her hand on her hip and Luna walked forward. \"No! I'm good thank you!\" He made Copper side-step away from Luna. \"Because you don't have the skills I posses.\" Jack stayed quiet. Now he was feeling what she had felt just moments before. He may be riding a more experienced and well-trained horse but that didn't make him any better. She smiled triumphantly. They arrived at the first fence they needed to check. Then they started. Only a lot more fences to go.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 They stopped to eat lunch at noon. Katy's mother had given them peanut butter sandwiches, two bottles of water each, and an apple each. Katy took an apple from the saddle bag Jack held in front of her. She crunched into it as she dismounted from Luna. This was a little past the half-way point. The farthest fence from the house was directly in front of them. Not trusting Luna to stand still while ground tied, she tied the reins around a fence post. Luna gave a big sigh and nipped Katy's back as she turned around. Katy swung around and look sternly at the mare. Luna pinned her strawberry ears to her head and stared back at Katy. \"There are good mares and then there are demon spawns.\" She commented, turning to look at Jack, who leaned against a wood post, eating a sandwich. He nodded his head and closed his eyes against the bright afternoon sun. Katy looked away and sat down next to her own post, far away from Luna. She sat there, crunching on her apple. It disappeared too quick and she threw the core to Luna. \"Jack, throw me a sandwich.\" He jumped. He shook his head a little, as if throwing a thought out of his mind. He had seemed to be out of it. Now he just reached into the saddle bag and tossed her a sandwich wrapped in a paper towel. She leaned back on the fence as she caught it. That was the first time she had seen Jack zone out like that. Usually she was the one that did that. That was when she was thinking about Flicka. Jack didn't zone out like that again. He finished his sandwich and apple before making Katy finish her water bottle. He too downed his and stuffed it back into the saddle bag. Katy grudgingly drank the water, glaring at Jack while she gulped the water. Jack took her empty water bottle right out of her hands and stuffed it in the saddle bag before slapping it on the back of his saddle and tying it into place. Katy walked over to Luna, who pinned her ears as she approached. Katy used her elbow to push the mares face away and protect her face. When Luna bared her teeth and leaned forward to bite her, she struck her elbow out, hitting Luna in the jaw and causing her to draw her head back. It wasn't enough to cause pain to the sassy mare, but it was enough to warn her and shock her from doing it again. Luna snorted and waited for Katy to untie the reins from the fence post. Finally she did. She lifted the reins over the mares head and drew them sharply back as the mare started to walk forward. The creak of leather told Katy that Jack had just mounted. She stuck her boot in the stirrup and was about to hoist herself over and into the saddle when Luna took off running at a brisk trot. Knocked off balance, she fell to the ground, her foot in the stirrup. The awkward angle of her boot made her foot get stuck. Luna didn't stop running. She ran for home. Katy was starting to get dragged after her. She screamed and yelled for Luna to stop but that only made Luna go faster. Into a canter. She thrashed her leg, not caring when her boot struck Luna in the side. Anger and fear mixed her emotions. With one big kick, her foot came loose. Luna, feeling the loss of weight, stretched out her neck and galloped for home. Katy rolled onto her side and grasped her side where a rock had struck her. Only seconds later, Jack slid to a stop neck to her on his knees. It was an exact replica of when she had fallen off Flicka when they first went out of the round pen while riding. Flicka had galloped along the fence with all the other horses who were inside it, galloping alongside her. Katy, bareback and unable to hold on to the reins, slipped from her back when Flicka gave a buck of joy. Jack and Gus had gotten to her first. Now Katy was laying on the ground again. Her head ached, her side ached, and her foot really ached. Jack seemed shocked into silence. He seemed to have abandoned talking all together after she had proved the point that she could ride. She braced herself for more taunts. They didn't come. It was much different than before. \"Katy! Are you okay! Is anything broken?\" He kneeled next to her, quickly scanning her body for limbs sticking out at awkward angles. \"The only thing that is broken is my respect for that horse.\" She gasped. Jack laughed, \"Good good, can you get up?\" \"Don't worry about me. You should go get that horse.\" \"She is long gone by now. Only good thing with barn sour horses is that they go right home. But, sometimes without you.\" Katy laughed and grabbed at her side. Jack leaned forward, his humerus expression disappeared. He leaned over her but not knowing what to do with his hands, her tightened them into fists and set them on his thighs. \"Are you hurt?\" \"No. I'm fine. Give me a minute.\" She took a deep breath and sat up. Jack leaned back and shifted onto his back pockets. Katy clenched her jaw and tightened her hands into fists and waited for the pain to subside. As it started easing away, she relaxed her hands. When she looked at Jack, she saw he was watching them. He glanced up at her, uncertainty in his eyes. \"I knew your father shouldn't have made you ride that horse.\" He almost shouted, anger visible on his face. \"Yeah. Well, what happened, happened.\" She said. \"But it shouldn't have! His decision could have gotten you killed! Sure, your could have too but you would have been prepared!\" \"Excuse me?\" She stood up and brushed off her clothes before putting her hands on her hips. \"I mean that if he let you choose your own choice, you would have chosen better and would have had a less chance of being killed.\" He stood up too. \"Who says I would be killed if I chose my own horse.\" She cocked an eyebrow. \"I do! I mean, you're reckless, who knows what you would have done if you were on a different horse. And I'm not even going to get started on Flicka. I mean...\" Katy's glare was so strong that he stopped talking. She whipped around on her heel and walked away. Footsteps behind her told her that Jack was following. \"Where are you going?\" \"Home.\" \"You are just going to walk?\" \"Yep.\" \"You won't get back until dinner.\" \"Fine.\" \"What about our job?\" \"I'll finish it tomorrow,\" She turned her head to look at his and she walked, \"Alone.\" In her small glance back, she saw Jack stop. She heard retreating footsteps when the beats of a horses hooves. Copper was at her side the next moment. Jack sat in the saddle staring down at her. She didn't like him sitting there, doing nothing but watch her walk. She refused to look at him. The next moment, he reached down and pushed her hat back onto her head. She hadn't realized it had fallen off. It took almost everything in her to stop herself from reaching up and touching it. She continued acting as if he wasn't there. She started walking faster. Copper fell into pace beside her. She silently grunted. She stopped and looked up at Jack. \"What!\" \"Well, we're going back aren't we?\" \"I'm not going with you! I don't need a babysitter.\" \"Well, I guess I'm out of a job\" \"Good. Then leave.\" She pointed her finger in the direction of the house. \"But I don't want to.\" \"Well I do!\" \"Then let me take you home\" He held out his hand. \"No!\" \"Come on. You know you want to.\" She really didn't want to. He wanted her to grab his hand and swing up behind the saddle. But she didn't want anything to do with Jack. She didn't want to see his face, hear his voice,or feel his presence around her. \"N.O. What does that spell! No.\" \"If you let me take you back, then you can get away from me.\" \"Or you could leave now and I could get the same thing.\" \"N.O. What does that spell! No.\" He imitated her in a high pitched voice. She ignored him and started walking. Copper walked with her, nuzzling her side. She winced and staggered a step as pain shot up her side. A hand clasped onto her arm as she tripped over her boot from her teeter of pain. When she stood up straight again, Jack removed his hand and sat up in his saddle again. She shallowed her breathing until the pain subsided again. Copper looked at her with his big brown eyes. Katy smiled at stroked her hand down the side of his face. He leaned into her touch. \"You like my horse but you don't like me? Whats up with that!\" \"Your horse is not a pain in the hindquarters.\" \"Are you saying that we have something in common\" he gasped and laughed. \"How about you shut you mouth and wheel your pony back home.\" \"No can do darlin\" \"Don't call be that.\" \"Sorry... darlin\" \"You little -\" she broke off as Copper snorted and flicked his ear at their squabbling. She resumed not talking. As walked stiffly, her muscles aching from her nice little drag across the rocks. Jack moved Copper forward until he was parallel with her. He reached down and poked her arm. She winced and kept walking. He poked her again. She winced but kept walking. Another poke. Then another. And another. And another. He kept poking her, giving her just enough time to wince. She stopped. \"Ow! Okay! I that what you wanted? Do you want to make me feel pain the whole time I walk back because I am not up for it!\" She shifted towards the ground and braced her side with her hands. Shock appeared on Jack's face and he dismounted, walking to her side. She moved away from him but he didn't back off. He placed his hand on her back and removed her hand from her side. A small spot of blood had appeared on her shirt where it had bled through her tank top. A faint gasp escaped her lips. Jack glanced up at her before pulling up her shirt and tank top a fraction of an inch where a cut was shown. Her shirt must have come up when she had her ungraceful slide across the field. A big rock was lodged into her skin, blood oozing out around it. Katy gasped and touched the skin around it. Jack raised his eyebrows at the size of the rock. \"Okay, now we should really get back.\" He turned around and swung himself back into the saddle, holding out his hand. \"First of all, no. Second of all, if I said yes, do you know how much dirt is on your horse! I mean, you didn't even brush him fully. Do you know of the bare back mark I will get from that!\" He gaped at her. \"You have a rock lodged in your side and you are afraid of getting a dirt mark on your jeans from a horse?\" \"Yes! I already have my clothes wet with blood. That stains!\" \"Fine!\" He started unbuttoning his blue plaid shirt to reveal a white t-shirt underneath. Katy felt awkward, watching him unbutton his shirt and looked down at her feet. Only three seconds later, she felt something hit her face. She ripped it from her face and glared at Jack. \"Happy?\" He fixed his t-shirt. Katy walked over to Copper and draped the shirt over his haunches. Jack held out his hand. She took it, her small hand a fraction of the size of his, and he pulled her up as she jumped. She groaned and grabbed at her side. Jack turn his head and peered back at her. After making sure she was okay, he clapped Copper's sides. Katy quickly put her hand around his waist, the other still planted on her side. Copper set into a canter towards home.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 Katy was lucky she hadn't tried to take out the rock from her side. It had bled quite a bit before they were able to make sure it was clean and cover it with a bandage from the emergency kit in the kitchen. Jack had stuck close while the rock was removed and the cut cleaned. It was absolutely annoying. Katy hopped off of the counter, smoothed the bandage over her skin, and pulled down her shirt. As she walked into the living room, she saw Dad talking with Jack on the couch. They hadn't seen her yet so she listened in. \"You were suppose to stick her her side and make sure something like this didn't happen.\" Dad said a little hotly to Jack. Seriously, he was acting as if she had broken a bone or gotten a concussion. She rolled her eyes and stepped up. She didn't want to defend Jack but she also didn't want Dad to make such a big deal over her anymore. \"Actually Daddy, it was just a smidge more your fault than it was Jack's. You told me to ride that horse.\" She said matter-of-factually. Dad stood up and turned to her. He obviously didn't know she was there. Jack looked at her sideways from the chair he had awkwardly been sitting in. Dad was speechless. She couldn't help but feel a little sorry. Now the problem was that she needed to get out that door that Dad was blocking and somehow get Flicka. Before she had said she would check the fences alone tomorrow but there was still enough light to do it now before it got dark. Flicka would enjoy the run too. \"Katy, I do not want to you on that loco mustang!\" He said sternly, how had he known she had planned to go ride her. \"She not loco, Daddy!\" She argued back. \"You've lied to my face once before I hope you don't do it again. Now tell me. Tell me straight to my face that you will not ride her without my permission.\" \"I can't do that.\" She said stubbornly. \"Then I will have to sell her.\" He said, being as stubborn as she was. \"You can't sell her, she's my horse!\" She shouted. \"I pay for her shoes, vet bills, and feed. I can sell her.\" \"If you're worried about money just sell Luna, she's the one who you don't need around here!\" \"Katy.\" He warned, calming down his voice form his previous yelling. \"Daddy, I can ride Flicka. I found her and I trained her. If you sell her I will never forgive you!\" She stomped past him and out the door. \"Katy!\" He shouted from inside the house. She broke out into a run towards the stables. The screen door slammed, he must be following her. She ran faster and turned sharply into Flicka's stall, grabbing her hackamore off the hook. Flicka nickered 'hello' and stuck her nose into the hackamore. Katy grabbed a brush from the tack box as she led Flicka out of her stall. But it wasn't Dad who had followed her. It was Jack. She stuck closely to Flicka's side, ready to launch herself onto her pretty horse. \"Flicka is not leaving.\" She said as Jack walked in. \"I don't think he wants to sell her. I think he just wants you to be safe.\" Jack said calmly. \"She is not leaving, this is her home!\" She argued. \"It's not exactly your choice.\" He looked almost sad. Katy spied him reaching for a lasso. She gasped and flung herself onto Flicka's back. She didn't use any second of her time to steady herself, instead she just clamped on and dug her heels into Flicka's side. They almost made it out of the barn before Jack's lasso landed around Flicka's neck. Katy tried desperately to yank it off but Jack was pulling it too tight for her to get her fingers underneath. Flicka reared up, struggling against the rope. Katy looked back at Jack wrapping the rope around a post. Her breath left her lungs. She pleaded for Jack to let go of the rope. He held on. She slipped from Flicka's back and landed, fumbling with the lasso to try to get it off of Flicka. Another rope sang but landed around her. She found that she couldn't move her arms. She screamed in protest but as she stepped back to loosen the rope. It kept on getting pulled tight. She knew exactly who had roped her. It was him who taught her. Now her father was pulling her quite literally away from her horse. She ignored how silly she must look, being roped away like a cow. She twisted around, struggling to get loose. She hated crying. It made her feel weak and fragile. Right now, she didn't care. She let her tears flow down her face as she screamed and flung herself at the rope, trying to reach Flicka. She looked to Jack for help, pleading showing over her whole stance. He didn't look at her. Just then her mother stepped out. \"What is going on out here, Rob?\" She stood on the porch with her hands on her hips. The rope loosened around Katy. She flung the rope over her head and ran to Flicka. There was talking but she didn't listen. She Went to Flicka and pulled at the rope. It didn't loosen. She looked at Jack again. This time he was looking at her. Guilt was plentiful in his eyes. He glanced over to her father before turning back to her. He took a breath. Katy was fairly far away and she could see it. He was struggling with himself. He unwrapped the rope once. Katy cheered silently, thanked him as much as she could without giving him away and slipped the rope off Flicka's neck. Before her father could get her again, she launched herself up onto Flicka's back and took off. She didn't want to look back but she had to, to make sure they weren't being followed. Jack was watching her go. Dad turned around, hands on hi hips, while Mom slammed the screen door behind her as she went back inside. She would have to thank Jack. Sure, he had started it, but he also came to his senses and let her go. That was improvement, and she was grateful. She had found her way into the woods and walked along the creek. Flicka danced around. She had enjoyed the run but it hadn't been enough for the previously wild mare. Katy slipped from her back and stroked Flicka's shoulder. Flicka twitched her skin, saying she wanted to run rather than be pampered. Part of her agreed with Flicka. She wanted to run and forget the days events. She was about to swing aboard when a crack sounded behind her. A twig had snapped. Her mind flashed a picture of the Cougar that had attacked Flicka. But when she whipped towards the sound, Flicka nickered a greeting. Flicka usually only greeted a few horses. Luckily, none of them were Dad's preferred ones to ride. She ran through them all. A couple Howard used to ride, one was Gus's favorite, then there was her mothers and two horses that Jack rarely rode. Obviously, it wasn't Howard. If it wasn't Dad, he was probably arguing with Mom. It could be Gus but she doubted he had came back from chores this early, much less ride out again to find her. That left one person. Jack. She did need to say thanks to him but she didn't want to now. But her luck was out. Jack rode around a gathering of tightly packed trees. Flicka called to her friend again. Brandy, a red chestnut mare, pranced when she caught sight of her buddy. Their stalls were right next to each other. Jack rode quietly and dismounted when he saw her standing on the ground, braced to jump upon Flicka. Leather creaked as he lowered himself from the saddle. How long had she been out here? It seemed like an hour. She stopped a few time with Flicka and saw no one around. How had Jack found her? She narrowed her eyes at him, trying to decipher his posture. He looked calm, lazy almost. He also looked ready to move. She shook her head. Confusing. She wasn't even going to try to understand. \"What do you want.\" She spat a little too harshly. She saw Jack tense at her tone. She felt a little flash of guilt but didn't apologize. He took his time answering, making himself busy adjusting the saddle and arranging the flaps of leather. She was getting impatient. She shifted from boot to boot. \"We weren't going to take her.\" He rubbed the back of his neck and nodded towards Flicka, who reach towards Brandy but stayed put. \"What were you doing then, it seemed pretty clear that it wasn't for fun.\" She was still angled to launch herself onto Flicka. \"It was like a warning I guess.\" He shrugged. A warning. A warning while coming so close to loading up Flicka and sending her away forever. That had done it. She grabbed a handful of mane and sung aboard. She took the small amount of time to steady herself before clamping her heels gently to Flicka's sides. \"Oh no you don't!\" Somehow Jack had arrived at her side. Flicka was a smaller horse, which allowed Jack to reach his arm up. As Flicka gathered herself to burst forward, Jacks arm wrapped around her waist and pulled her down. Without a saddle, it was useless to try and stay on. She was pulled off of Flicka. To make it worse, Jack was taller than she was and he feet dangled before she touched the ground. She shoved Jack away, forcing him to release her. She dropped a little and touched the ground. She glared at Jack. Forget apologizing, now he had gone too far. She wanted to tackle him to the ground. She examined him to see if it was possible for her to do. She figured out a way and ran at him. She tucked her foot behind his boots and shoved him backwards. Unable to take a step back, he fell towards the ground. Unfortunately, he grabbed her and tugged her down with him. With her leg stuck under his, she was unable to fight back. She landed just to the side of him. He was laughing. Katy glared even more and struggled to pull her out from under him. She pulled it free and stood up. Flicka was standing a few yards away, looking back wondering where her rider had gone. Katy tried to run to her but Jack tripped her. With a scream, the ground came closer. She caught herself just in time but was immediately flipped over onto her back and pinned down. She had forgot that Jack used to wrestle before he dropped out of high school. It was useless to move. She didn't understand how but she couldn't move anything but her fingers and toes. She glared up at Jack, who wasn't even looking at her. He had pinned her to the ground then made sure the horses hadn't left. I angered her at how easy it was for him to win. She struggled on the ground, attempting to move her arms out of his grasp. This made Jack look down. He seemed to enjoy making her feel helpless and weak. \"I. Hate. You!\" She shouted as she tried jerking her arms out of his grasp. \"Sure you do.\" His expression was unreadable. She kept struggling for a few more seconds before finally giving up. Jack finally released her and got up. She pushed to her feet as quickly a she could, glaring daggers at Jack, who just laughed. She started walking to Flicka to leave. \"Wait wait wait!\" Jack said. \"Don't you dare touch me again!\" She whipped around and began advancing on him so he had to walk backwards, \"I don't want your filthy hands contaminating me or my horse,\" she pointed to Flicka, \"You can turn around and leave here right now,\" Jack's back touched the tree where Brandy was standing, \"Because I don't want to see you at all right now. I'm this close, \"she held up her fingers that were barely a millimeter apart, \"to tearing you apart.\" Katy was smaller than Jack and had to look up at him. Jack was pressed against the tree with a shocked expression. \"I didn't want to do it. Your father said I would be fired if I didn't\" He said so quietly, it might have been a whisper. That stopped Katy. She looked at him, but now the shock was on her face. She looked for words but came up speechless. Jack placed his hands on her shoulders and pushed her gently back a step. \"Oh, and sorry about my filthy little fingers.\" He waved them at her like a parent would do when telling a ghost story. She was still speechless. She realized that she was still standing close to him, even though he had just moved her back. How close had she been standing just a few seconds ago? She didn't know. When she glanced back up to Jack's face, he had a small smirk placed there. She wanted to glare, she really did, but she couldn't. Her face threatened to turn red. She couldn't stop it. Jack's smirk grew. She took three steps back, placing herself farther away. Jack took one step forward so he wasn't stuck against the tree. Now she didn't know if she should apologize or accuse him of making fun of her. She chose to walk away. Back to Flicka. This time Jack didn't follow her. The creak of leather told her he had mounted up. With all the 'work' she had just done, it was hard to get back up on Flicka. She almost didn't make it and had to pull herself up the rest of the way. \"Just come back to the house.\" Jack said as she started walking down to the creek. \"No.\" She said and let Flicka drink. \"Then I'll just tag along until you do.\" The frustrating Jack she knew was back. \"No.\" She said again, hoping he would just leave. \"Maybe I should pull you off Flicka again and just take you back myself\" He laughed, she didn't know if he was joking of not so she allowed Flicka to walk into the water. \"No.\" \"Look, your parents are arguing. I don't want to go back alone if they are still arguing so I either tag along or you come back with me.\" Katy looked back at him, turning herself around on Flicka. He was resting his hands on his saddle horn while he let the chestnut drink. He didn't show any sighs that he was joking. She bit her lip. She didn't like the fact that her parents were arguing but she didn't like the idea of join back to be in the middle of it either. Never the less, she didn't want Jack hanging around. Flicka started splashing in the water. Katy let her and settled deep into thought. She didn't even notice when Jack allowed Brandy to go into the water and splash alongside Flicka. Jack poked her. She jumped so violently that she almost slipped off Flicka, Jack reached out and grabbed her wrist to keep her from falling. Flicka stopped pawing the water and angled her ears back to her to see if there was danger. As much as Katy hated it, she allowed Jack to help pull her up from the side of Flicka. \"I think Flicka has had enough commotion today, just get on and lets go back.\" He kicked his foot out of the stirrup, making it clear that he wanted her to sit behind the saddle and let Flicka follow on her own. Katy considered it. Flicka's want to run could have just been her way of saying she wanted to go back to her stall. Her excitement to see Brandy could have just been another hint. Without a saddle, it was harder on the beautiful mare's back. Katy eyes Jack's stirrup then Brandy. The big mare was definitely powerful enough to carry them both. She had barely broken a sweat and was eager to get going. Looking back to Flicka, Katy noticed her head was lower than usual, even though she was standing in the water. Her ears, instead of alert, were laying lazily to the side and her tail swished even though there didn't seem to be any flies. She looked back to Jack's stirrup. She could easily reach it from Flicka, instead of sliding off into the water. Jack noticed her staring at the stirrup and he sat up straighter. He hadn't expected her to consider it. Katy wanted to ride Flicka but she didn't want to make riding a bad thing. When Flicka bobbed her head, she made up her mind. It was possible that the bobbing of the head could hint pain. She didn't want to risk it and prepared to switch horses. She sat sideways on Flicka, reaching her foot towards the stirrup. Jack moved his foot out of the way. Her foot in the stirrup, she tried to figure out how to actually make the leap across horses. Flicka was still standing too far away to just step over and she didn't want to hang all her weight on Brandy's side for the extended amount of time it would take to actually get behind the saddle. Jack noticed her pause and held out his hand. As much as she disliked it, Jack was right. She had to take his help to get on without making Brandy stumble from the extra weight. As quickly as she could, she grabbed Jack's wrist and pulled herself off Flicka and as successfully onto Brandy as she could. Jack's stirrups were so long, she was hanging half off the horse. She had made the mistake of giving Jack her left hand. So she had to reach awkwardly sideways. Surprisingly steadily, Jack heaved her up the rest of the way. When Jack didn't let go of her wrist when she did his, she stumbled and wasn't able to make it behind the saddle. She fell forward onto Jack and had to push him forward to move and position herself behind to saddle. Jack moved back into his saddle again and looked over his shoulder as Katy tried to find the most comfortable position. Flicka turned her head to look at Katy, who had disappeared from her back. Jack asked Brandy forward. Instead of walking calmly out of the water, she jumped out. Katy slid back quickly and was forced to grab onto Jack to steady herself. Once again, he looked back to make sure she was okay. \"Okay. I'm fine now hurry up, I don't want to be near you.\" Jack laughed in a hushed tone and let Brandy lope back home, Flicka following at a gliding trot.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 When Jack and Katy got back to the house, Dad was on the porch leaning on the rail. His eyes wandered from Flicka, who followed Brandy, to Katy who sat behind the saddle which Jack occupied. Katy couldn't see Dad's expression but he pushed off the rail and strode down to the barn where they were heading. \"Oh no.\" Jack groaned. \"What?\" She didn't know why Jack had acted the way he did. When they stopped, Katy slid off of Brandy and grabbed Flicka. When she faced her father, he had his hands on his sides. She stared into his eyes even though she wanted to look away even more. He looked from her, to the horses, to Jack. Jack stiffened, he had admitted to her once before that he was scared of her father. \"I'm sorry.\" Her father mumbled as he looked at Katy. She blinked. Had he really just said that? Never before had he ever said that to her before. Her mouth fell open before she closed it. When he didn't walk away, she waited for him to speak. \"I'm not going to sell Flicka. Though, I'd rather you switch horses once and a while. Today proved my suspicions. She is a mustang but even she has limits. You should thank Jack for noticing.\" He nodded his head in Jack's direction. Katy glanced at him but didn't thank him. She was too busy stroking Flicka's neck, silently sending her many apologies. Flicka breathed out and licked her lips. \"Now you two still need to check the fences and since it will be getting dark out soon, you better pack for cold.\" Katy's father said before turning around and marching off. \"Wait, I have to check the rest of the fences all night?\" Katy called after him. \"Yes'sir're. Pick your own horse, eat something, get packed up, then head out. I don't want to see you two until tomorrow afternoon.\" \"Does he have to come.\" Katy looked over at Jack. \"Get to it!\" That meant yes. Katy grumbled to herself and walked towards the barn, Flicka following right behind her. After getting Flicka situated in her stall, eating a sandwich, and packing up things she would need in a saddle bag, Katy scanned the stalls for a good horse. Of course there was Yankee, the chestnut gelding she had ridden when she first saw the mountain lion, but he seemed pretty cozy in his stall, sleeping soundly. After walking past all the stalls twice, she grabbed a bridle and walked into Eagle's stall. An energetic gelding with a dark chocolate coat and a milky mane. A beautiful horse but also a horse that dealt nicely with riding in the dark. After saddling up and strapping on the saddle pack, Katy lead Eagle out to where she thought she saw Jack. He was tying on a saddle pack to his saddle, which sat upon and black and white paint. She recognized the horse as Echo, an obedient gelding. \"I blame you.\" Jack said, not even turning around to face her. \"Why do you blame me?\" Katy asked, not really caring. \"Because we would be done already if-\" \"If I hadn't been dragged across the rocks then been threatened to get my horse taken from me?\" Katy huffed and mounted onto Eagle, spinning him around and trotting off towards the woods that would take them the fastest route to where they left off. She didn't wait for Jack, once again annoyed by the fact that he existed. He would catch up eventually to annoy her out of her mind. She had a full night to listen to his chatter while they inspected the fence. Sure enough, he caught up a few minutes later, trotting up beside her before matching pace. \"Do you hate me then?\" He asked. Katy groaned. Could they not ride in silence for once? \"Hey, I have a right to know if my travel companion wants to kill me in my sleep.\" Katy raised an eyebrow at him speaking her mind clear enough. \"Okay, maybe not a travel companion but a riding buddy. A fence fixing fellow friend. A job partner. A-\" \"Okay enough, I get it.\" Katy spat. \"Easy there tiger.\" Jack laughed. Katy let her breath out slowly, controlling her temper. \"So you hate me?\" \"At the moment.\" Katy said stiffly. \"Ah, so you haven't always hated me, eh?\" \"Nope, not always.\" A small flashback played in Katy's head. \"When did you not hate me?\" Jack leaned forward in the saddle, resting his arm on the saddle horn. Katy sighed and looked over at Jack. She played the scene bugging her mind in her head. She had gotten on Flicka for the first time. The pretty mare, never had been ridden before, held her ground for a few seconds. But still being new to the weight on her back and expecting danger, Flicka exploded, bucking and leaping away. Katy, in a large brown coat, wasn't able to stay on more than a few seconds. She hit the dirt as Flicka reared in the air, terrified with the experience she had just endured. Katy was unable to move for a few seconds, shock and the impact combined making her unable to move. She sat up just as boots hit the ground and someone reached down and grabbed her arm, pulling her up. She was pushed toward the fence as Flicka ran past, circling the arena once again. She standing on the other side of the fence when she saw Jack climbing up after her. Standing on the wood rail, she tightened her grip, waiting for him to run off and get her father. But instead, he just hooked his leg over the fence and stated, \"You're not suppose to go in there.\" \"Whats it to you?\" Katy argued, disappointing at having fallen off and prolonging her efforts in proving to her father that she could ride Flicka. \"You could get hurt, besides its what your father said.\" Jack responded. \"How long are you going to be afraid of my father?\" Katy asked, watching Flicka make another lap. \"Uh, forever. And you? Why are you sneaking out here in the middle of the night if you're not scared?\" Katy had to think about that for a second. \"Because I have to.\" She decided on. Jack was silent for a few seconds, turning to watch Flicka calming down a little bit. \"Then, I won't let nobody stop you.\" Katy looked up at him in surprise, not having expected that. Jack gave her a little smile then climbed down from the fence and left. Katy snapped back to reality. Jack was looking at her, leaning on his saddle horn. His question still hung in the air. \"When did you not hate me?\" Katy sighed. \"You remember when I fell off of Flicka in the round pen?\" She spoke quietly. \"When you nearly died for the first time in your sneaking around at midnight?\" He laughed. \"Yeah, well, do you remember what you said?\" \"I remember you asking how long I was going to be afraid of your father, which I replied always.\" \"Forever.\" She said. When Jack gave her a confused head tilt she explained further, \"You said forever.\" Jack gave her an odd smile and wiggled his eyebrows. \"This is why I hate you now.\" She growled. \"Go on, why didn't you hate me then. Was my fear of your father attracting?\" He wiggled his eyebrows again. \"What is wrong with you? No! Gosh, no! Ew! No one could ever be attracted to you! Gross!\" Katy retorted. \"Fine, whatever. Now go on.\" \"I don't think I want to now.\" Katy said. \"Would you rather I came up with a few ideas why? Like your undying love for my smile?\" To make his point across, he smiled as largely as he could. \"Shut up and I'll talk.\" Katy waited for him to stop laughing at himself. \"Fine I'm ready,\" He cleared his throat and calmed his face, \"I'm ready.\" \"Okay do you remember what you said after all that?\" Jack's face twisted as he thought. \"Nope.\" \"Well, you said you wouldn't let anybody stop me.\" Katy said quietly. Jack sat up in his saddle, thinking. Katy watched as his face changed. She knew he was remembering how he also broke that promise. When he sent Flicka away. His eyes flickered up to her and his mouth opened. Katy broke the eye contact and swung out into a lope, not leaving time for Jack to say anything. Eagle held his head up high and was noticeably holding himself back as they came to the open field. The setting sun shining against them, Katy released Eagle's hold and clucked. Eagle flattened out, galloping with his ears perked. He was like Flicka that way, he loved running. She tried her best to ignore the following thuds of hoof beats and the dark hooves striking the ground in the corner of her vision. Coming to her senses of the long ride ahead, she sat back and allowed Eagle to slow himself. Jack appeared at her side again. She could feel him watching her. She glanced over a him. \"What?\" She asked a little too harshly. \"Nothing. Just wondering why you hate me so much now.\" Katy tensed. \"You are not asking that question.\" She growled. \"I just want to hear it. Throw it at me.\" Katy turned towards him. \"Really? Okay, how about when you broke your promise and let my dad take Flicka away. Or how about when you found Flicka after the cougar and didn't do anything to help her but went back to my father so that he could kill her. Then there was programming the idea into his head to keep me from riding her even longer. Then telling him after you caught me sneaking out on her. Agreeing to be a freaking babysitter. Being your annoying self. Lassoing Flicka. Wrestling me to the ground and making me feel helpless. There's more but I tried to keep it as short as I could.\" Katy turned her back to him, asking Eagle to lengthen his walk. \"Okay. Point taken. But listen to this. I broke the promise so you wouldn't get hurt. I told your father not to kill Flicka because even in your state, you could tell that it would be a gun shot and not thunder. Most of the other stuff was so you wouldn't get hurt. My annoying self is just me.\" He flashed a smile, \"I already told you why I lassoed her. And you attacked me first and wouldn't give up so making you not try to hit me seemed the best way to get you to listen.\" Katy didn't respond, still angry at him. Why did she have to check the fences with him anyway? It wasn't fair. They rode in silence for the next hour or so. Into the dark. Peaceful silence. Until Jack started chattering on about who knows what. Katy gritted her teeth and tried her best to ignore him. Two hours she was able to hold her tongue. Two hours of nonstop chattering. \"Shut up will you! I don't care about anything you are talking about!\" She shouted. \"Why should I? We have work to do and this passes the time getting there.\" \"You should stop because it's annoying!\" She spat back. \"I am annoying aren't I?\" \"Yes!\" \"Pity for you.\" \"Pity for you after I pull you down from your horse and leave you here stranded.\" \"Violent.\" He chuckled. \"You deserve it.\" \"Perhaps we should stop then, so the horses can drink?\" He nodded towards a stream that had been running alongside them. \"Fine.\" Katy kicked her foot out of the stirrup and swung out of the saddle. Jack did the same and they walked to the water. Eagle and Echo dipped their heads. As Eagle dipped his head in the water, Katy was suddenly aware of eyes on her. She raised an eyebrow to Jack, who was staring at her with a face that said he was deep in thought. \"What?\" He lengthened Echo's reins and took two steps closer to her, \"I guess I still don't understand. Do you want to hate me or am I just that bad at being nice to you.\" She huffed out a laugh, \"Please, you're bad at anything.\" But Jack didn't laugh, for once he didn't laugh. She realized that he was serious, for once. Was he feeling guilty? She sighed and lengthened Eagle's reins, taking two steps forward to meet him. There, she took off his hat. \"What are you-\" \"This is my favorite of your hats.\" She cut him off. He blinked, confused. She spun it around once and put it back on his head. \"Want to know why?\" He just stared back, \"You usually wore that hat on the days that I didn't mind you as a person, that night with Flicka, for example.\" \"And this means what?\" \"Good days and bad days. To answer your question: I don't hate you but you both have good and bad days of being nice to me.\" He looked down, that wasn't the answer he wanted. \"Hey,\" She pushed his shoulder to get him to look up at her, \"Where did Jack go?\" Finally, a smile formed on his face. The hint of worry in her chest sank away and she walked away, seeing as Eagle had finished drinking. Author's note- WOWEEEE! I haven't been on this site in ages! (Sorry to all my faithful readers, I've been a horrile writer, leaving these original stories of mine behind). I have been active on a different site if you would like to check out my stories there, I'm thinking of posting this story on there if people would like. Check out my other story called \"The Black Clothed Man\" on Wattpad. Find me at Supernatural_Devotee :)[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 Only when the moon was high in the sky did they finally stop for the night. Jack called it as they arrived at a fence with water nearby. Katy was the first one off, already looking forward to sleep. \"Where's your tent?\" Jack asked as he took off his saddle and bridle from Echo. \"What are you talking about, it's right-\" She stopped when it wasn't behind her saddle. No. Maybe it was in her saddlebags. Nope. What? Had it fallen off? In desperation, she quickly untacked Eagle and took out a flashlight, shining it all around as Jack set up his tent. After a few minutes of searching, she lost hope. \"Look's like I'm sleeping outside tonight.\" She sighed. Just then, the sky opened up and unseen clouds began to drop rain. It became heavier and heavier by the second. \"Hurry up and get your saddle in my tent before everything gets soaked,\" Jack called as he gathered up his saddle. Katy hurried and obliged. As soon as she got her saddle inside, the sky really started pouring, like a waterfall coming from the clouds. \"Did you seriously forget your tent?\" Jack tsked his tongue. \"No! It just fell somewhere.\" \"Welp, make yourself comfortable.\" He started unrolling his sleeping bag. \"I'll wait it out.\" She said. \"And sleep on the wet grass?\" \"I'll find a tree or something.\" \"How highly ambiguous, just sleep here.\" \"With you? Nuh-uh.\" He peeked back at her, eyebrow raised. She rolled her eyes and sat by her saddle in the corner, watching the rain. \"Fine, suit yourself, I'm falling asleep where it's dry.\" \"Fine.\" She repeated. As he made himself comfortable, she watched the rain. After a little while, her eyelids began to droop. She didn't remember when, but somehow she had fallen asleep. It was a good call too because the rain still hadn't stopped by the time she woke up, now covered by her sleeping bag, which had been unzipped to form a blanket. She sat up, rubbing her head. Even in her drowsy state, she realized that Jack was gone. Furrowing her brows, she looked around for any sign of where he was. His pack was still in the tent, along with his saddle. Crawling to the entrance flap of the tent, she unzipped the flap, rubbed her eyes, and was about to stand up when a face appeared right in front of her. Surprised, she drew back. \"Good morning.\" Jack greeted, brushing past her. \"Where did you go?\" \"Not even a good morning back?\" She threw him a look. \"I was making sure the horses were eating.\" \"And?\" \"They were.\" \"Great, let's go.\" She began to get her things together. He didn't make an effort, instead watching her fold up the sleeping bag. Now that she thought about it, she hadn't taken it out. Was he waiting for her to say something about it? She glanced at him but he was just looking at her, \"What?\" \"I'm waiting to see how long it's going to take you to notice that you don't have a raincoat.\" She peeked in her open saddlebag out of the corner of her eye. She hadn't noticed that. \"We can just hurry up and finish checking the fences then head back.\" \"Are you stupid?\" \"No, I am not.\" \"You sure? Because there is no way you can ride through that without getting sick.\" \"It doesn't matter.\" \"It does, you are going to get me fired. My job right now is to make sure you don't hurt yourself with your recklessness. So you can't get sick.\" \"What else can we do? You don't have a raincoat either,\" She nodded towards his wet shirt, \"it's either stay here or go out and face it.\" \"Just calm down, the rain is going to stop soon anyway, give it an hour or two. Just close up the tent already, before water gets in.\" \"I can't make myself stay in here with you.\" She frowned, crossing her arms to show her displeasure. \"I'll help.\" He offered. She shot him a glare before zipping up the entrance to keep the wind from blowing the rain in. \"If the rain doesn't stop in an hour, I'm leaving.\" He chuckled, \"If you can.\" With a huff, she pulled out a water bottle and took a long drink. \"In the meantime, we get an excuse to sleep.\" Jack beamed, celebrating. \"How are you a ranch hand when you are so lazy?\" He shrugged, \"Talent.\" She scoffed, \"That's not a kind of talent you want to have.\" He shrugged and began to climb into his sleeping bag, \"Wake me up when the rain starts or if you are trying to leave.\" She rolled her eyes. Less than two seconds later, she threw her water bottle at his head. \"Ow! What?\" He rubbed at his head. \"Don't take your shirt off, you dimwit!\" \"Why not, it's soaked.\" \"So?\" \"I'm not trying to get sick, are you crazy?\" \"Get sick, then I won't have to see you. Just keep your shirt on.\" He pouted before changing his face into a smirk, \"Are you afraid you won't be able to resist me?\" She threw her boot at him, only just missing him. That stupid smile was on his face as he laughed. \"I'm not getting sick.\" He stated, pulling off his t-shirt. In an effort to stop him, she threw her other boot at him. He dodged it before picked both of her boots up. \"Now you really can't leave while I'm asleep.\" At the realization of what he meant, she dove over and tried to rip her boots from his hands. He stuffed them into his sleeping bag before she could stop him. Not ready to give up, she pulled up the sleeping bag. \"Now, now, now.\" Jack started in an amused voice. The way in which he was talking made her stop for the moment and look at him, her fingers gripping part of her boots that he wasn't allowing out. \"How scandalous. I never thought I would see Katy McLaughlin on top of a half-naked man, pulling off his covers.\" He blocked his head before she could hit him, \"Give them back.\" \"Then get off first.\" She narrowed her eyes, \"Then you will just move them to the bottom.\" He lifted an eyebrow, \"So what, are we just going to hang out like this until the rain stops?\" She scowled, \"Give them back.\" \"No.\" She glared at him and made her voice more forceful, \"Give. Them. Back.\" He put an arm behind his head. If he only moved an inch, she would be able to get her boots to budge. \"Fine, go ahead and stay there, I'll allow this favor to you.\" He made himself comfortable and closed his eyes. \"What favor?\" He opened an eye, \"Giving you the opportunity to stare at my flawless physique of course.\" At her disgust, she lost her grip on her boots. Realizing that there was no hope in getting them back, she gave up, flinging herself off of him and retreating to the other side of the tent. \"I hate you so much.\" She whispered. He smiled, \"Good.\" Author's Note Alrighty, I managed to write another chapter while procrastinating (hahaha oops). Would anyone want me to put Flicka 2 on Wattpad? There you can comment on specific parts of the chapter and I can see which parts you guys are enjoying the best. If you do, please message me either here or through my Wattpad (Supernatural_Devotee).

","Summary":" Chapter 1 Katy buttoned up her western flannel black plaid shirt and reached down to grab her boots"},{"Movie":"Dangerous Liaisons","Title":"The Weight of Love","Author":"AlternativeRocker","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7746388","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Authors Note: I have fell madly in love with these characters all over again and have finally had the idea for some fic. Based pre-novel since the book version is all I'm really familiar with. I have 12 chapters planned for this, all of which are slightly over 500 words each. Disclaimer: Don't own anything to do with the characters or book. It was her voice that first caught his attention. The way it softly lowered when she was trying to be serious and how whenever she laughed it sounded as if she was from a different region straight afterwards but recovered it before anyone else noticed. Of course he knew who she was, her reputation was almost as well known as his own, yet they had never came into contact before this night. Their mutual friends were always mentioning her name in conversation, unbeknown to them the Vicomte loved to keep tabs on that particular woman because the stories about her were fascinating. She was even more impressive in the flesh with her long dark hair tied up and a few loose tendrils framing her face, a black and red dress accentuating her curves while contrasting against her pale skin. He tried to hide a smirk as he watched her attempt to wind the conversation she was in down to a stop, her eyes were darting everywhere seeking some reason to escape from the clutches of the second most beautiful woman in the room - Marquise de Merteuil clearly outshone all the others in every aspect. Their lines of vision finally met and he motioned her over; she pretended to recognise him and made her way across the room. \"I would ask for the name of my knight in shining armour but the truth is I know exactly who you are and I guess you know my name?\" \"Is there any chance of me not knowing you when we live in the same circles?\" She raised an eyebrow in amusement, \"So you prefer to answer a question with another question, that must reveal something about you but I can't put my finger on what, yet.\" \"You're quite a piece of work yourself if you don't mind me saying.\" Swirling around the wine that was in a glass in her hand she looked closely at him, working out if he was as sharp and charming as he made out to be. He didn't break eye contact as the silence continued and they felt something - not 'electricity' per say, a simple connection - pass between them. They knew that they had found their new sparring partner or play-toy ot whatever they would like the other to be. She suddenly wished they had met when she wasn't beginning to lose her way with men because they now wanted to be seen with younger females. The male facing her was clearly the same age as her, if not a little older, yet he was more handsome than the majority of her evening partners and all she could think of was how to get him to see her in the same way and whisk her off to some private place. When he was this near to her he could see the tell-tale signs that showed she had lived through a few too many tough times and they made her so much more real and attractive. He could see how she doubted her own looks and wanted to reassure her but couldn't get the words out of his mouth. Instead he slowly raised his hand and ran a finger across her gloved knuckles and turned away. \"I hope I can rescue you again Marquise.\"[Chapter 2] Authors Note: Second chapter here is Merteuil's feelings after meeting Valmont. A week had passed since the party and there were not enough books she could read or letters to write that would stop her thinking of Valmont. she was intrigued by his little actions and the moment they had shared. Even though they had only spoke a few sentences to each other she longed to spend more time in his company and the idea of having to dance and pretend to enjoy herself while around different men was verging on repulsive. She understood how improper it would be to make first contact but not giving into temptation was an alien concept to her so she wrote out a short message to him, telling him that it was a pleasure to have met him and how she hoped it wouldn't take so long until their second meeting. It would take days to get to him anyway so there was always the possibility of seeing him at a function before then, by which time she could think of an excuse to have took the initial step. When she and her long-since dead husband had been courting there had never been this sense of urgency between them; yes, she had found him entertaining generally but it was for convenience rather than desire that he had proposed to her. Her mother and father would have certainly disowned her had she refused the offer so she was married within weeks of becoming acquaintances, unfortunately for him the wedded bliss only lasted two years as a hunting accident had taken him away. She had been upset but knew she didn't deserve the outpourings of sympathy that were put upon her, she hadn't loved him as much as everyone else seemed to. There was currently a horrible feeling in her stomach that was telling her that she would be more devastated if the Vicomte died right now than she ever had been over her late spouse and she did not know this man in the slightest. She rang the bell for her maid so as to give her the letter to be posted and work on what she would be wearing to dear Madame de Rosemonde's party the following Friday. She knew the relationship between her new addiction and her host an that was the main reason for planning so early, if he happened to make an appearance she had to at least try to catch his eye and entice him this time after the disastrous feeling of self-loathing last time. Admittedly she had been dressing up especially for him for years now with never any luck of him showing face, but now she had met him in person all he images and fantasies built from the sordid stories she heard dulled in comparison to the one she created with his exact features being brought to life by her and her alone.[Chapter 3] Authors Note: This chapter is Valmont's feelings about her. This wasn't real. What he was feeling must be a figment of his imagination. He could not be falling for a woman whom he had only had one interaction with. It felt like it though, it felt so tangible that his stomach even turned to butterflies when he thought of her. These sensations were new to him, usually he saw a woman he liked, got what he wanted from her then left but he didn't have any desire to allow her to leave his life this quickly. He thought it was first necessary to explore this emotion that coursed through him nearly every minute of every day. One week was enough of this torment because people expected more of the promiscuous Vicomte that had a new date for each function he attended. Seriously, he hadn't so much as considered who to take to his aunt's formal party yet since there was not a single soul in France - probably even the whole world - who was like er and therefore he wanted the best for his mind, and social appearance of course. Before encountering the Marquise he had taken enjoyment out of the brief relationships he was known for and it used to be so easy that way. Understanding how to live with the knowledge that there was one person for who competition was never an issue, who was also the person he wanted nobody else to have, was surprisingly difficult. he now thought of her as apple in the Garden of Eden; something he was sure he shouldn't get too close to yet the need to speak and touch her again was overwhelming. A letter had never harmed anyone and if he never got a reply he would try to see a way to forget her, whereas if she did respond then he may possibly get some personal details about her which could be used to his advantage in several different situations. He didn't mean that in a stalker way, just that if he did know what she liked and disliked he could tailor any coming meeting to her wihes. Talking would be enough, he wanted to hear all her opinions on every subject they could think of. Yes, a letter to start things would suffice. Now he had to contact some other people about ideas on almost-worthy women he could take to this celebration of life thing. If Merteuil was there then all the better, seeing him with someone else might distract from the fact that he would be staring at her for the night and he could ply his date with alcohol so that he would be able to drink plenty himself to build up the courage to approach her. Feeling intimated by a female was also something he had to get comfortable with, she was feisty in all the tales he had heard but never quite believed it until her sarcastic comments directed at him were voiced. He had never met anyone, never mind someone of the opposite sex, who spoke like that in an opening introduction. He liked it though. He liked her even more because of it.[Chapter 4] Authors Note: Now for the next meeting. :D Madame de Rosemonde's house was perfectly large enough to hold all the people required at a gathering that would be talked about for certain. Her parties were always topics of interest for months after they were held, even if she had to be the person to continuously bring it up. The hostess had given up waiting near the door for latecomers but made an exception when she saw her nephew;s carriage pull up in her drive. She tutted as she watched his 'friend' step down to ground level, she prayed he would settle down soon because the girls were getting far too young and they would ultimately want children which, when the time came, he would be incapable of providing them with. Oh, how she would like to set him up with someone more respectable, who would present him with power of her own and a life that was already established. He deserved better than these girls who only were recognised because of the number of wealthy men they ended up on the arms of. From a distance she witnessed a curious moment in which he and a woman she had known for many years caught sight of each other. The lady in question was Marquise de Merteuil and for the life of her Rosemonde couldn't work out why they both looked so shy and wary as they looked the other person up and down from across the room. Merteuil obviously had a younger male with her but he had disappeared into the mass of people on the make-shift dancefloor. She had watched the sweet girl go through the loss of her husband at such a young age and although she understood the lack of passion in the union there had been a change in her attitude towards who courted. She was so like Valmont in that respect and she had secretly hoped they would someday meet - if only to argue about the opposing views on politics she knew they had. As the night wore on Madame de Rosemonde kept a close watch on the two people but they never spoke once but if truth be told they would glance over when they knew the other was facing another direction and keep their eyes fixed on that position for as long as they could without anybody else cataching on. It did confuse her however that Valmont had spoken to and danced with every woman he could apart from the one he had been ogling for the better part of three hours. During the dance while the evening became night and the drink flowed heavily he started to get more forward with the women and his hands moved from being hesitantly placed on the back, down toward regions that should stay private until marriage, and he was not married or serious about any one of these people. Merteuil was not trying to hide the looks no, her jealousy and hurt was etched upon her pretty face. She was not alone for the evening since most men still found her irresistible to look at and talk to but she kept them all at a distance larger than usual. When Valmont's mouth started to whisper into the ear of a blonde that could only just be eighteen while his hands were on her tiny waist and hips that was the last straw was her. The room suddenly felt too hot and her corset was too tight and she needed to get out of that room.[Chapter 5] Valmont was scarcely aware of what he was saying to this girl who was the daughter of an earl - or was it a lord, maybe a duke - but his surroundings came sharply back into focus when he saw the Marquise push her current partner and rush past all the guests in the direction of the doors to the garden. He had a sinking feeling that this may have been his fault and decided he could not just leave her out there by herself. He graciously told the female with her arms around his neck that he would have to refuse the next dance, and slowly sped up his walking speed as he got nearer the door. It took a minute for his eyes to readjust and then another to seek her out. The moonlight reflected on her skin and that was the only method of finding her as the darkness of her dress blended in to the night sky. She was standing at the side of the large fountain in the centre of the grass which was made in the shape of numerous cherubs and angels and was completely breathtaking at this time. The air was freezing cold and he could see she was shivering but that probably was not only because of the temperature. \"I may have had a lot of alcohol but this is spectacular.\" Merteuil turned quickly to face him, \"Have you not got an eligible female to be waltzing around the floor with?\" \"I chose to let her be home for her bedtime.\" She started to walk away as she commented, \"How considerate.\" He followed behind her, \"I got your letter yesterday. It was nice to know you enjoyed at least out first meeting.\" \"I felt it would be polite to get into contact with you but now I see there was not much need because you did not acknowledge my existence all night. I got your letter also.\" \"I am acknowledging your existence now, I have been since I first heard your name. You are the one enigma I have yet to solve and although this is but our second evening in other's company I am positive I want to know you for the remaining years of my life.\" That caught her by surprise. She had no idea what she thought he would say but even if she had that would have been last on the list. Not that it didn't make her heart flutter. A lot of him did that though. He daringly took a step to close a little of the gap between them and she didn't say anything which would stop his actions. In fact there was a shadow of a smile on her lips, so he gently reached out and brought her hand to his mouth and kissed it softly. \"Now, I believe there are still a number of dances my aunt has planned and I have partnered all the other females. Would you care to join me?\" Their hands were still holding on to one another as she replied, \"It would be my pleasure, if you can dance that is.\" \"You've been watching me all evening; you know I can.\"[Chapter 6] It was almost three months to the day since they had last laid eyes on the other person. They constantly tried to set up a meeting but there was forever justifiable reasons for the plans too fail. The letters never stopped though, keeping their newest acquaintance updated on every part of their lives that they considered interesting. However, neither felt a small afternoon tea party was worthy of sending word about - if they had then they would know this would be there next place of contact. When he walked into the garden and saw another guest with her back to him he was surprised as he had expected to be the only one. But when she turned around to greet him Valmont could not hide his delight. \"Marquise, I did not not know that you would be gracing our presence today.\" He said as he kissed her hand and felt the spark run through them once again. \"I could say the same about you, Vicomte.\" She replied while biting the inside of her cheek to stop herself visibly smiling. It was a good thing that more unexpected guests had been invited as gradually Valmont and Merteuil began to ignore that they were meant to be communicating with other people. They found themselves in a corner with no one else nearby so they were able to talk about all of the gossip they had heard over the past months. \"There are words flying around about you and a certain Lady - and her daughter may I add - is it true?\" Mischief glittered in her eyes while the question hung in the air. \"A man does not kiss and tell,\" he paused with a smirk, watching as she glared at him for seemingly not wanting to proceed, until he continued, \"but if it is circulating then it would be rude for me to keep you out of the loop. It was not in the same night I insist, it was over the course of the weekend last month and I had spent a few days wooing the younger girl and eventually I had my way. Then of course her mother found out and I had to appease her through the method I know best.\" She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and raised an eyebrow in admiration of his forwardness. \"I cannot believe there are still women who have not experienced time with you, you are on a whole new level of intrigue to one's brain. \"You do realise ths is the longest conversation we have had face-to-face and that you have barely 'experienced time' with me?\" \"Oh but we are different to everyone in each other's lives, are we not? Deep down I know you so well, just like you know me. We should have met sooner.\" He softly ran his thumb down the side of her cheek and whispered, \"I do not agree. We were supposed to meet this way because now we know what we like and want from a person. We could be incredible.\" \"We will be but one thing you should understand... I am not this easy.\" She commented before turning away and walking over to someone who he did not recognise and simply started a discussion, not looking back at Valmont once.[Chapter 7] After some hours of attempting to catch her alone again Valmont was close to giving up. He guessed that this was how she felt when he had danced with everyone else at the party. They were getting good at this type of revenge already. When the sun started to set the party grew to a stop and the Marquise assumed Valmont had left when she tried to find him. That was up to the point where she was stood saying farewell to the host and he suddenly appeared at her side. \"You should know I am not that simple to walk away from then.\" \"I thought you had already departed Vicomte, is this you going now?\" The other people in the forecourt were also speaking amongst themselves so he had no hesitation in answering, \"Yes. I was wondering whether it would be to our advantage to use only one carriage between us because I do not live so far from you, if not we will be awfully lonely... and I may have told my footman that I would not need to go home until the morning.\" She kept her emotions in-check as she asked, \"Were you thinking you might have a woman to spend the night with so you would not go home?\" He smiled in response. \"In addition you live a long way from my home so you would be more than welcome to stay in one of my many empty rooms, to save you excess travelling in one day.\" He looked at her in surprise, he honestly was not expecting her to agree, never mind offer a bed. \"I would love that. Thank you.\" It hit her then that she had just requested he stay in her house for an entire evening, and she wanted to take back what she said. Their flirting had been harmless before but now she was terrified at the prospect of him entering her private sanctuary and seeing her with her guard slightly lowered. There was also the issue of the journey with him because when talking one did not have the opportunity to carefully construct a perfect reply as was possible in writing. Still, she did want him in every single way that she could, and tonight opened up numerous doors into their futures and their ever-progressing relationship. As they moved towards her awaiting mode of transport she sensed his presence close to her each time she put one foot in front of the other, she then felt a peculiar warmth touch her back and realised it was the palm of his hand on the ties of her light dress. They caught eyes and were transfixed by what they saw. Both were consumed with desire and neither wanted to break any of the current connections they had, physical or otherwise. While they say in the confined space, facing the same direction she was aware of all her self-concious fears resurfacing. She knew what this day was leading to and worried about what he would think of her not-so-impeccable body shape outside of the literally breathtaking corsets she squeezed into. Unbeknown to her Valmont was having the same doubts about his own self image but wanted nothing more than to explore her and see what she looked like without all the social prerequisites such as tiny waists and face powder that made them look less than naturally beautiful. If only one of them had mentioned that they would be at this afternoon party, they could have prepared more for this.[Chapter 8] They were stood in the lounge room by the fireplace to keep warm after the incredibly cold carriage ride. They each had a glass of wine in their grasp to distract at least one of their hands before it did something stupid like reaching out to touch the other person. Valmont made a joke and she did laugh; he was once again caught completely off guard by how beautiful the sound he heard was. After she quietened they stayed facing each other, not saying a word, unsure of where to go from the point they were at. His fingers kept moving closer to her own but brought them back every time out of sheer cowardice. She eventually noticed the action and decided to put him out of his misery and touched his fingertips. Their eyes were both staring at their hands as smiles started to appear when he continued to move up her forearm to her shoulder. The wine glasses were quickly placed on the ledge to their side, his other hand settling itself on her cheek and she leaned in to the caress. They finally looked at the face of the person opposite them and their eyes connected. Merteuil stepped forward and tilted her head back, able to feel his breath on the tip of her nose. Their lips brushed tentatively while they found out what their partner enjoyed more in a first kiss. Both of them giggled a little when their arms tangled and bumped together as she tried to circle her arms around his neck but it did not stop the kiss getting progressively deeper and more passionate. A number of minutes later she intertwined their right hands and led them out of the area they were in toward the main staircase and up to the master bedroom, never breaking the contact of their lips once. She did not care that she was stepping all over the bottom of her dress because the feeling on her lips and body was wonderful. He wanted to feel more of her skin so slowly split them apart and spun her around whilst smiling at the pure confusion that marred her face, his fingers undoing the delicate knots and loosening the lace on the dress before making a start on the corst He felt her take a sharp breath in and paused his work, \"Is there something the matter, my darling?\" \"Gosh no, it's just... you're being so careful and I don't want you to get too hopeful about what is undernath.\" Before answering he pressed his mouth against her shoulder-blade and neck, \"I may be hopeful but there is no possibility of me even nearing my imagination on how breathtaking you will be when I remove this. You are the most endearing beauty I have happened upon.\" She couldn't let him continue undressing her until showing some gratitude for what he had said. She turned in his arms and kissed him as hard as she could and began to unbutton his jacket and shirt.[Chapter 9] Valmont and Merteuil were hardly alone over the months following that night, wondering how they had managed to carry out their lives before sharing a bed with each other. Usually - in all prior relationships - they would never fall asleep with the same person more than twice but now they hated any evening when they were forced apart. The parties and public events were glorious and horrendous in equal measures because they were allowed to dance and talk the night away together but then they still had to dance with eligible suitors and were unsure of how to keep their jealousy under control when a hand slid lower or smiles lingered. The talk between the women of these upper-classes was all about the two halves of the partnership. Speculation was rife about whether there was a new level to how well they were acquainted but nobody was certain of anything. They were careful not to let their kisses be displayed further than to a hand or cheek, but they would drift towards their lover at all times, especially if one had just been propositioned by somebody else. These offers were refused without hesitation every time which also got into the gossip wheel and the unbelievable rejections were noted and discussed greatly without the two in question knowing. It was not that Valmont or Merteuil were ashamed of their relationship or worried about what people would say about it; they simply wanted to keep it on a need to know basis and since they were the only ones who needed to now this was how it of them also loved the sneaking around an intimacy of having a secret that was just for them to share. When dancing he always pulled her in closer than anyone else and she would inevitably rest her head against his solid shoulder and adored the way they felt and when holding and moving in unison. At one of these parties Valmont could not keep his hands off her. It just so happened it was another at Rosemonde's house so the hall was full and he could not easily pull her to a corner. He then saw the open doors to the garden where they had met once before, waited until they were dancing and slowly moved them outside. It was summer now so it was still quite light and the air was warm. \"Waht are you doing?\" She asked, breathlessly giggling. He did not answer her until they were next to the fountain again, \"I am desperate to kiss you so I am stealing you from all those undeserving eyes.\" He pressed his lips firmly against hers and could feel her smile as gave in to him. It, of course, had not been a priority to either of them to look around the area before expressing their ever-growing attraction to each other. They had not seen the two women standing nearby who were known to spread any society news prior to the subjects having any idea. The kiss was the talk of Rosemonde's party by the time their mouths had even separated.[Chapter 10] He sat on her bed, watching as she perfected the hairstyle that had just been finished. Valmont smiled; she was never truly happy with things that had not been done by her own hands. They were not even going to any special place, really only a dinner with a small number of close friends who would not think very much less of them if one of her dark loose curls was hanging over her cheeks. Them , he loved saying that about himself and Merteuil. It made their relationship sound serious and three months into it that was exactly what they were. he stood up from the soft piece of furniture and walked over until he was right behind her. Bending down he placed kissed along her neck and shoulder, minding not to let any of his hands or feature move her hair or smudge her carefully applied blush. \"Stop this now,\" she warned as she refrained from leaning into his lips. \"What is going to happen if I d not leave you?\" \"I could be very angry and may not share a bed tonight..\" Valmont continued to assault her flesh and he smiled proudly when she let out a small moan. While he did this she still tried to finish getting ready but after she finally got one glove on she attempted to push his chest back. It did no good. It only caused her to turn around and start being kissed on the mouth, which she had recently been ever more powerless to pull away from. They slowly broke apart and they stared at the other, he was the person to cut the silence short with a simple statement. \"I love you.\" She did not break their eye contact yet almost cut her lip with the amount of pressure her teeth were putting upon it. This was the first time either had admitted how strongly they did feel for each other and she was shocked that it was he who was doing it. Before saying anything or answering him with words she kissed him lightly on his lips. She proceeded to quietly say those same three words back to him, meaning every syllable for the first time in her romantic history. They knew time was ticking onwards and that guests would be arriving imminently but they had reached a stage in a relationship that was further that they had ventured prior to this and both would rather spend the rest of the evening with the person opposite them. Her arms were around his neck, softly stroking the smooth skin there until she unclasped her hands and rested her forehead against his so she could wipe away the traces of lip-tint that were mostly on his mouth but a number were on his cheeks and neck also. He smirked and rubbed their noses together in a playful caress. Holding out his hands so as to help her stand, knowing that the layers of fabric on her dress were restricting her movements. The Marquise accepted his gesture deftly and assisted in getting to her feet. One of their pairs of hands stayed linked as they left the room and smiled widely when they walked down the stairs.[Chapter 11] Authors Note: Here is the chapter I least wanted to write as I hate them being mad at each other. \"He was almost undressing you in front of everyone there, including myself and he knows what you are in my life!\" Merteuil threw her hands up in anger. Six months of being desperately in love with one another and they still had large trust issues as they did not believe themselves good enough yet. \"What does that matter? I love you and do not care in any way about how a different man looks at me.\" \"You were tempted by him, I could see it in your eyes.\" She glared at him and started shouting louder, \"Whenever you looked at me I was looking straight back at you. I was tempted by you! I do not even know what that Lord's surname was. I wish you understood that since I met you I have not looked twice at somebody like that.\" \"You said what I am only last with with that Countess. How dare you be so hypocritical!\" Looking at him with tears shining in her eyes she commented, \"I don't know where to go from here. This happens every time we are not alone and I cannot bear it. I want to be with you more than I can begin to express in words but this pain is killing me.\" \"Please do not do this, we are too spectacular together. I love you and I do not believe there is another woman better suited to me as you. I will not let you break us in to two separate entities again.\" As he reached out to grab her hand with his own she said, \"You have to let us go our different paths now.\" Tears were spilling down her cheeks openly by this point and he wanted nothing more than to hold her and erase the sadness he could see and hear in her voice, but she had stepped far away from the fireplace and when he tried to get near she moved backwards to the extreme that she had to turn to the left so she would not bang back against the wall. They stared at the other for a worrying amount of time until he gave in and obeyed her. The second she saw his resolve she wanted to break down right there and then, it was the last thing she could wish for because she only wanted him to have shown his passion for her by standing up to her, but now he was acting like he did not care enough. So she let him go. What she had said had been true - seeing him woo other women was hard - she just did not expect this part of the once beautiful partnership to feel worse than if she reached inside her body and pulled out each of her organs one by one. It would be improper of her to chase after a man in her social ranking but oh how she dreamt that he would come back through those open doors. He stayed out though and she knew they had overstepped the line and that there would not be any turning back around from this moment on.[Chapter 12] My dearest Valmont, I do hope you are well when this reaches you and that there is not a large problem with my sending of this but I must admit I miss our communications. I hear you have made progress with that Countess we met, do tell me how she is because I always thought her cold and a little odd. You must not feel it necessary to reply to this if you still rightly blame me for the night all those months ago. On that topic, I do not believe explained myself adequately and you had the gracious manners to do as I asked with only minimum hesitation. Although I do wish you had got back in contact when you were first ready to move on - which you have to be by now surely? - as I want somebody to listen to me again. Do you remember that dashing young man I brought to Rosemonde's party before we saw eye to eye? I do not suppose you would speak to him and ward him off coming to my home every night? He is beginning to make me feel nervous. I was never good enough for you; you are the kindest human to walk this ground and I allowed you to slip away from me. You made me believe I was worthy and that I looked beautiful at all times and for that I shall be eternally grateful, not that I think you are correct. Snow is beginning to settle on the grounds that I can see from this window. I maybe should forget about moments from our time but there was that one day when the weather so unexpectedly changed that we ended up completely soaked with the water in the snowflakes and we spent the remainder of the evening sitting in front of this fireplace, not moving once because it was colder everywhere else. It feels as though we had thousands of those days where simplicity won up over but now I seem to make every task a lot harder than it could be just so that I can spend time doing anything that distracts me from the constant onslaught of elderly relatives asking if they will ever need to buy a new dress or if I shall be remarrying. I do not want to go through it all again though - please, I mean no offence by this, but I never saw us getting to that stage either. I have grown out of the adulation of choosing an outfit, decorations and which people I dislike yet would still have to invite to the monstrosity. The most interesting part of my wedding day was moving our relationship to the bedroom, I say interesting because it barely lasted the time his speech had. He then proceeded to tell me that is how all first times are; he did not know that I had experienced my first time some years prior to that with a lowly footman, and that every other since was at least double. Why am I telling you this? You hate me rightfully. I say this though, just remember I will forever love and respect you. Yours deeply, M.
